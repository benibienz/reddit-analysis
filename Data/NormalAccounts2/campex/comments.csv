Whether they're generally tired or it's partly because of the loss of a few key members, I couldn't say which affected the albums more. Disappointing, but I'm keen for you're welcome. ",2016-11-17 06:23:49+00:00,da3wgr8,1,t3_569xi7,3544701,electricsix

2,"So there I am in Sri Lanka, formerly Ceylon, at about 3 O'clock in the morning, looking for one thousand brown MnM's to fill a brandy glass, or Ozzy wouldn't go on stage that night. So Jeff Beck pops his head around the door and mentions there's a little sweet shop on the edge of town. So, we go. And: it's closed. So there's me and Keith Moon, and David Crosby, breaking into that little sweet shop. Well, instead of a guard dog, they've got this bloody great big Bengal tiger. I managed to take out the tiger with a can of mace, but the shop owner and his son... that's a different story altogether. I had to beat them to death with their own shoes. Nasty business, really. But sure enough, I got the MnM's, and Ozzy went on stage and did a great show. ",2016-09-15 09:56:14+00:00,d7nm4wt,1,t3_52spfq,46571,AskReddit

10,"When working in a deli section of a supermarket, I had been having a terribly shitty day. One of the last customers of the night came in, a fairly older gentleman, and I gave my usual ""G'day mate, how can I help?"". He replied with a sour look, stared at me for just too long, and I began to ask again. 
He responded with ""Mate?? I am not your mate! I'm your elder and should be treated as such!""
I laughed it off and hoped he was joking, and asked him what he was after. He hadn't stopped staring, and had in fact started to glare. He asked me to apologise, at which point I told him ""Look, you know I didn't call you arsehole, I called you mate!"". He went and got the duty manager who said she'd speak to me and investigate thoroughly. We laughed about it as soon as he left.

I had a friend in a call centre I worked in who was just dreadful on the phone, but never rude. He had had literally the worst day for people screaming in his ear. He had a South African man on the phone complaining about service, going absolutely off on my colleague. 
I found out the full story afterwards, but at the time, me and my team heard his side like this:
""Yes, yep.... no I unders-.... yes.... ye-.... no but th-...... ye-..... yes...... you need to under-......... ye-.... look, look, LOOK, LOOK MATE THIS ISN'T FUCKING APARTHEID! GET THAT THROUGH YOUR THICK HEAD MATE!.......... YEA YOU FUCKING WOULD HANG UP, DOG!""
We were stunned, our callers were stunned. Again, no sort of trouble, due to a sympathetic manager. Lucky.
