3,"Thx for sharing, which also concerns regarding my post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/4qehj5/rx_480_kraken_g10/ .So i have a question, what is the temperature conditions of the vrams while you furmark? Because i knew it judging by the picture of your complete installation is that the airflow from the g10's fan wouldn't hit the vrams, and also what is your opinion about the kraken g10 if it to fit in AIB RX480s rather than reference one? I'm tempting to buy an RX480 but i'm in complete dilemma of choosing either the reference or the AIB version. Thx",2016-08-27 17:02:38+00:00,d6yylkf,1,t3_4zuxqn,2172,NZXT
