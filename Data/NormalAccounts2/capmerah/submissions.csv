They have experiencing this many times since the launch until they got frustrated and stopped playing this game and play other mobas. 

Ive played this game since alpha and played a thousand times and i realized that they were right, i cant carry a bad team to win the match, i cant become powerful through kills and i cant control my team through multiple situations. I know that team coordination is the only key to win in this game but that is nothing but a coin toss. Different players, different attitude, different mindsets randomly sorted in every match. Being a leader in a bad team doesnt do any good. Communicating through pings doesnt make your team heed your command, this is all about 'team based' game where you play for 'fun' but not for seriousness. I know but it just really makes it impossible to master when dealing with this.

Lets discuss this problem with a different approach. If you take this gameplay into different analogy by comparing this game into other team based sports games like football and basketball, you should also realize that it also takes just 1 player in that team to make a difference. Same as hots. For example in football or soccer, when the striker who possess the ball running to reach to the penalty box, the opposing defender have to take that ball back before the striker shoots, but that defender is too slow at takling the striker that results in a goal. If i were the coach i would have subbed the weakest link before any of this happens. At least the losing team can kick or sell that defender when he is unprofessional even through tough training and bring in the good one.
In hots, you cant kick a player during the game.

This context regarding the system applies to hots because both games adopted the same system. But sports games are popular than hots is because they have strong teams without any weakest links, like i said in the last paragraph, that player can be kick or subbed when he doesnt know what to do to benefit the entire team. In hots you just have to play the entire session in agony while playing with constant bad players that result a loss without the propability of comebacks.

The only way for blizzard to fix this problem is to adjust their mm system for more mm accuracy that filter out inexperience players from the game with high ranking or veteran players. I understand that theyve addressing this but they taking long to fix this, its already 1 and 1/2 years since launch and flawed mm is a deal breaker to most new players. But if they cant fix that in time, then they have to change the entire gameplay system to a system which allow rewards through individual experiences like LoL and dota 2. Truth hurts i know but blizzard really doesnt have any choices left. This game is already bleeding too many players since launch(i know that since i have many friends playing hots back then, now its just me left). I really love this game and i trust blizzard as a professional game company but if blizzard takes years to fix this simple problem, then i have to abandon this game and find another default moba to love playing.",heroesofthestorm,Shared xp = 1 bad ally = lose = increase in toxicity(tldr),https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/43kdzj/shared_xp_1_bad_ally_lose_increase_in_toxicitytldr/
