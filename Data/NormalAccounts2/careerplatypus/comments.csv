0,Because I clear the phone screens and there's never really much of a behavioral at all during the interviews. I can make decent conversation with the interviewers and joke around a bit...yet I don't see any offers. ,2016-02-19 02:14:17+00:00,d05cvyu,2,t1_d05avvg,3051,cscareerquestions
1,"I did the guy never really wanted to help me out there. So I started listing out what I'd put in each table. The worst part was the guy sat there staring at his phone half the time not paying attention. Just an awkward interview all around.

At least that's the one time I remember ""failing"" an interview hard and having a total cringe time in person. I also totally tanked an Amazon phone screen a couple times. ",2016-02-11 23:50:28+00:00,czwo0f7,4,t1_czwnv8f,234,cscareerquestions

3,"Shot yourself in the foot with the low bound, recruiters always try to low ball to make you look attractive to the company. The fact that they started swearing at you though...I'd tell them to walk off a cliff.

Always set your low bound at what you actually want. Give ONE number, that's what you're going to get (maybe $5k more if they want to look good). 

As a negotation tactic at this point, your best you can do is play ""I can accept for $5000 more, otherwise I have to follow through with another interview first"". It might get them to move on you on their time they already invested.  ",2016-02-11 23:34:43+00:00,czwnfnn,1,t3_45bf8q,4581,cscareerquestions
4,"DICE, Indeed, Craigslist and LinkedIn are my job hunt go tos, but find the actual job and apply direct if you can. Better to work with internal recruiters if you can.

I've got jobs through external recruiters, but you have to sort through a lot of outsourced Indian illiterates. Just comes with the territory. ",2016-02-11 23:13:51+00:00,czwmmwj,1,t3_45b5mw,6753,cscareerquestions
5,"At least you have a company culture. I work at a company where all the other devs moved to a separate downtown office...and all have conversations via IM only even if you're right next to them. Meetings are chilly silence in between managers trying to prompt for input. I haven't had a conversation with a human being for more than 5 minutes in 6 months. Blech...

Tech companies in general are a wasteland of bad social skills and strange cultures. When I do talk to people at my company all they want to do is talk about metal music or indie games, and I'm into neither.",2016-02-11 23:12:17+00:00,czwmktg,1,t3_459j16,25064,cscareerquestions
6,"The worst was one where I was asked to do UML diagrams to design a DB schema. I can do schema but I'd never done UML diagrams...I sat there trying to scribble stuff down on the board for about an hour before the guy stopped me.

7,"I've heard good and bad things about government work. I've heard it's stable but pays a little lower and more paperwork and red tape. You can definitely get out of $40k range if you field yourself out there, though if you're happy with your current position nothing wrong with that either.

8,"What about this is humblebrag? I know most people on this sub talk about making $100k+, but it's like this golden number that salaries don't seem to start much higher than. I think it's pretty straightforward I'm asking either if the salaries can go up or where I should target my goals next.

Honestly I come here for information, not to brag. It's advice from this sub that got me where I'm at in the first place. ",2015-10-12 04:51:36+00:00,cvwmpxg,8,t1_cvwgb79,12211,cscareerquestions
9,"1 Lie - Seriously...tell them your previous salaries were higher. It actually works

2 Ask For What You Want - Don't settle, tell companies what you expect to make, they might lowball you in the end but at least you're honest with your starting point

3 Use Recruiters - By numbers, recruiters, putting your resume on DICE and other such places, make them work to find what you're looking for. Yeah, you get spam recruiter calls a lot and junk, but it's cost of doing business.

4 Use Interviews As Leverage - During offers say ""I've got another interview in a week, I'll cancel it for $10k more"". This one worked for me, and if they don't bite, you can accept later at no real risk.",2015-10-12 04:48:54+00:00,cvwmnhv,4,t1_cvwkz3z,3718,cscareerquestions

11,"I used YNAB for a while but didn't like it. Too much micromanagement involved in allocating categories. Bills fluctuate (I get the idea of it is to setup funds for things instead of going on whim but still) and it was more trouble than it was worth.

12,"I'm curious where these ceilings come in. When I was in school years back the info I went off of was that $100k was the top. Did I have bad information or have salaries gone up?

Also I'm really curious about getting into the financial stuff. Not just for the money but the work seems really interesting. I had only one recruiter approach me with one of those jobs and he was pretty flaky. Is there stuff like that out on the west coast to go after? How would I get into that?

16,"I'm not really one of those financial independence guys simply because I don't want to spend my 20s and 30s missing out on fun so I can live well later. Like I said in the OP though I've been mostly responsible other than my car which was a bit much ($600/month) but I do know I can afford it. It's the car I always wanted as a kid and one of the things that motivated me to get through to where I am now. I'll add to that I've done a few weekend trips to Seattle that cost a bit, but even that was sharing a hotel with friends, and staying in a crappy hotel outside Seattle to save money.

I'm putting $500 in a savings account a month right now and $1200 a month towards my student loans (min payment is $450). Getting out of those is a priority so I can start investing and I'll be doing it in 3 years instead of the 10 they're supposed to take. 

Ultimately I feel like I'm doing okay with my finances. Could I be doing better? Maybe, but I would've missed out on a lot of cool experiences I had the last few years otherwise.",2015-10-11 18:17:16+00:00,cvw0pfg,3,t1_cvvv8ih,9403,cscareerquestions
17,"Well I wouldn't call myself above average. I can code well, but nothing special.

19,"The salary game, from what I've seen is a bunch of nonsense. I worked hard at a job that paid $20/hr and breezed through my day at another that paid $75k. And, negotiating is a big part of salary, so knowing how to BS and game during that could mean the guy working twice as hard next to you is making half what you are.

That being said, adjust for areas like SF and NYC, the cost of living adjusts that salary down a lot.


Myself though, I'm a mercenary in this trade. If someone is willing to pay me more and make my life more comfortable, I'm gone. Why wouldn't I? ",2015-10-11 10:25:11+00:00,cvvowvv,1,t3_3oaui1,19084,cscareerquestions
