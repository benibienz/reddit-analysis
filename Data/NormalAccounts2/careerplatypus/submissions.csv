Trouble is, I feel like I'm clueless where to start. It's pretty easy for Seattle or SF, but both of which have an obscene cost of living. They're desperate for devs and I've always drowned in leads.


I'm looking at maybe somewhere like Raleigh, NC or Austin, TX or even a smaller city that has a decent tech company willing to take me in. My main motivations are cheaper living and being within a 3 hour drive of a beach somewhere. But I need to figure out how to get in, how to meet recruiters, or send my resume where it won't go into the hells of a Taleo database never to be seen again. 


Aside from publicly showing interest on LinkedIn which I can't do due to coworkers networking with me on there, are there good ways to show interest in being recruited for jobs that offer relocation assistance? Or where the ""good"" leads are that don't just lead to a job board web app that never gets looked at.

Spent a whole weekend (Friday and Monday) on interviews in Seattle (I'm in Portland) and I honestly thought I did great on them. Apparently not though because I'm still sitting here waiting.

The first company I did 2 phone interviews and a coding project that took me a whole weekend to complete, and when I got to the in person I answered every question with them telling me the answer was good enough, even going onto an ""extra"" problem. Then the recruiter followed up a couple times he'd know by the end of Tuesday and nothing back since then so I'm assuming I didn't get it.

The second interview was a lot easier, no real whiteboarding just ""stump me"" questions and a computer coding project that while I asked a few questions on, they told me it should take the whole day and I completed in 4 hours. I went home from that one feeling like the job would be too easy for me...but they didn't even extend an offer.

Now I'm sitting here with two phone/computer interviews for Big 4s coming up feeling like I'm going to crack. Failure is in my head (I've failed one of the companies twice at this stage) and I don't feel confident at all. Full on impostor syndrome. I've been worried about my job for a while and now I can't seem to land another. I have to wonder if the bar is going up or if I just suck much worse than I think I do. I'm kind of expecting to fail my next interview tomorrow, but I'm going through with it, and another big silicon valley company wants to interview me...I don't even know if I want to try.  What are some good options to get my head back into it or at least some companies that don't have grueling technical interviews? Is management or something besides coding possible? I feel like they're looking for coding superman, and I'm average and do my work well and that's it.

I HATE job interviews in this field, and part of me wants to get out of CS at some point just because of it. It always seems 100 times harder than the actual work I end up doing, and I run into egos and people trying to trip me up on CS trivia that is apparently supposed to somehow be relevant.

In the last month of my job search I've been asked to do bit-manipulation and base number conversions off the top of my head (seriously who cares?), take home projects that have taken me entire weekends, hacker rank tests that frustrated me due to not revealing what test input is failing when I'm trying to debug, being asked to describe coding algorithms over the phone, and this is all before the in person interviews!

So far I've only had one in person but it took me 5 hours, 4 of which were spent coding and being told I did better than the other applicants just to not get extended an offer (I'm guessing on salary requirements but seriously WTF?). 

I have two in person interviews tomorrow and another Friday plus 4 more phone screens and I about want to take my head off. How exactly is 6 senior devs staring at you writing whiteboard code of algorithms you never use in your day to day work supposed to help? 

The worst part I feel like is that I always have to study this and memorize these gotchas (O(n) notation, how to traverse binary trees, linked list loop detection, etc) that never even once have come up in my work, and I'll forget again until next time I need to interview. If I actually was asked to do any of this at my job, even once, I would be able to do it well, but it's all just theory and stuff that's done by underlying frameworks we glue together at our jobs most of the time anyway. 

And yes, I have the ""Cracking the Coding Interview"", ""Programming Interviews Exposed"" and all of those. I also have terrible anxiety and as much as I study, I feel like it's 50/50 if I get whatever trick problem they're going to ask off the top of my head.

Am I the only one with these issues? I have a bunch of interviews coming up and I feel an overwhelming sense of dread, not excitement. I would love it if it felt like I was trying to determine if a company is right for me, instead it always feels like I'm trying to see if I pass a certain bar and every bar is different. This is the only field I can think of where we have to go through this, and I wish it wasn't like this.

Any tips on getting over my anxiety and actually getting ""good"" at these interviews? Feels like it's a skill in itself that I don't really have. ",cscareerquestions,Do Interviews EVER Get Easier?,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/45bjwj/do_interviews_ever_get_easier/

I'm looking in both areas though honestly my preference is to move to Seattle so I've made that my priority. My strategy has included having my resume and active on Dice to fish for recruiters, as well as hunting on Craigslist, and e-mail and form applying for anything I see that looks interesting (about 10 apps a day). Sadly, the market seems slow right now, at least on Craigslist, and the recruiters only seem to cold call me from Portland.

Should I be doing a different strategy to hunt for a city I'm moving to? Are there better job sites? Any advice?


Side Rant: WTF with these recruiters? So far I've had 3 try to fill me at the company I'm currently working at (Did they even look at my resume, or LinkedIn profile?) and I'm getting 4-5 calls from people from India with area code numbers from various parts of the US offering me the same 5 or 6 positions I'm not qualified for.

Ive been at my current job (4th CS job, first that pays six figures) for about 9 months now, and I've never felt like I fit, but I've survived so far. I've had hardcore impostor syndrome since I got here, and it's made worse by working with technologies I'm too familiar with but have tried to learn on the job. To complicate things, most of the programming staff is in another office from me and all of the help I get is through online means, where they don't always answer their IMs/e-mails in a timely fashion. Ontop of that, work is measured both for estimates and work done in hours logged, which makes me feel like I always have a ticking clock I'm behind. And lately...I've been freezing up when I can't get answer or figure out how to do something.

This has happened a few times but this last week, I spent 3 work days literally doing nothing but maybe 30 minutes of work a day because I've been so anxious and confused about one simple ticket that I spend all day just trying to calm my head down. Even when I take medication to calm my nerves, I just can't finish anything. I'm embarrassed and at this point I have 40 hours logged to a ticket on a simple search box change in a Rails project because I don't understand part of the framework and can't get a variable to persist. Even stack overflow searches that usually bail me out haven't helped, and I've been too nervous to ask for help because I know I screwed up bad and it's just getting worse.


Part of me just wants to run, and not just because of these issues, but I know they need to be solved for me to be successful at another company. My company just got bought out, a nasty contract where they take any work you do outside of work among other things was added and I may be taking a pay cut and won't find out for two weeks. I don't know if I'll last that long, so I've been applying for jobs but it's hard to see my getting anything else in my current mental state.

Attempts to contact my manager have failed, largely since she's in meetings 90% of the day, and doesn't respond to my IMs or e-mails (though I haven't been very aggressive about it). I feel like I need to be super assertive, but I've just been given busy work. My performance review lately all got good reviews but I think that's only because I'm basically invisible to my manager. I don't know if I should panic or just...keep doing what I'm doing and collect pay until someone says something. I've never been warned or told I'm not doing good work, but in my head I feel like the worst programmer on the planet.


During my job search, I'm nervous because I've failed many many programming interviews because of my nerves. This one was only 4 hours on basic DB design and coding, though I have no particular area of expertise having done totally new languages and stacks and types of coding (web, embedded, DB processing, desktop application) at each job I've done. I've done C/C++ but not deep enough to be an expert, I know a little Java, a little C#, a little of each of the big DB techs, but I don't think I'm entry level this deep into my career. I don't really want to start over at a $60k salary from $100k but...I don't know what I qualify for at this point. 


How can I pull this all together? I'm reading programing interview books and tutorials on my weekends, but I don't know how much I'm retaining of use.

Started at a $20 an hour job, went to $55k, then $75k and now $100k at the job I've been at for almost a year now. I have hopped around a lot to do so, because that's the way the game is played to get your salary to grow, but I see most salaries listed places to only ever get a little bit higher than this point.


Salary was one of the things that motivated me to work hard the last few years. At this point I have ""enough"" money to pay extra on my student loans and buy what I need or want, but I'd love to have money to put towards investing and a big savings to be able to not work if I want to for a while. Without anywhere to work up to, I feel bored and unmotivated.

So since I'm so young...what do I have to look forward to in my career growth? Once you hit that magic $100k point, is it better to just sit at the same company collecting 3% raises for the next 40 years of your career? Can an average programmer who's hungry rise to say $150-200k somewhere, or am I better off trying to start my own business or making money investing or doing real estate or something?


I desperately want something to aspire to, a new goal. This is what drives me in life, and if I can't make anymore money in my career it kind of feels lifeless. I of course have other areas in life I can focus my motivation on, but I wish it could be my career that I spend 40 hours a week on, or at least I could work less or not at all eventually.


I also wonder if maybe I can find other things my career can do for me. Maybe jobs where I can travel, or if there's rewarding programming jobs out there that involve actually doing something useful besides crunching data for corporations. I thought about getting into reverse engineering or infosec or something different, but I wouldn't know how to switch gears. If this is about where the money tops at, I'd like to do something interesting.
