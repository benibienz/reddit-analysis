0,"My Dad is a nosey neighbor. The guy next door to my parents is a bit of an alcoholic. He comes and goes a lot on liquor runs. My Dad hadn't seen him leave in a few days and became concerned. He went to check on him, but got no answer so, he Googled the next door neighbors parents phone number to do a wellness check. Turns out he had fallen in the basement and couldn't move. Was in really bad shape when his family came to check on him and left in an ambulance. My Dad's nosey-ness (is that a word?) ended up saving his life.

1,"I'm also a long time fan. Been to 100+ show. I will say that they are still good. However, this last time that I saw them it was mostly their newer hits. It was good, but not the same for me. They are still as funny as ever and put on amazing show, but if you're an older fan the song selection will be disappointing. ",2015-12-24 03:16:08+00:00,cy9oe23,1,t3_3va9l2,1773047,barenakedladies
