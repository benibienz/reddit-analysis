1,"Sorry. I just can not agree that having a .co .us or some other extension would be more valuable than owning the .com. If so, why does every large company or organization own either both or the com? This is simple. Sure there are lots of ways to spend money, but if you do not capture your brand you have lost it all. Trademarks do not capture the brand entirely the way simply owning the domain would. To be honest in the world of business, this is a small cost for the years &amp; years &amp; hundreds of thousands of users that would miss the site or end up using a competitor.

2,"As we explained in the donation page we would like to spend monetized funds on development rather than the domain. We figured this was better as a crowdfunding campaign.  For years now we have kept cashortrade free &amp; ad free. During this time members have made bought, sold, &amp; traded thousands upon thousands of tickets at no cost. With 75,000 members we are only asking the community to kick in a couple bucks here and there to make this happen, protect the brand, and build the movement.

3,"Ok. Again I appreciate the feedback, I just disagree. I have been in the web design industry for 16 years. I know the game. What if cashortrade did get funding...&amp;amp;amp; then someone came along &amp;amp;amp; built a similar idea under the .com? &amp;amp;amp; what if that idea skews what your idea is actually really about? I don't mean to sound crewed or snappy here, but it is simply obvious that in order to build a large movement around your brand &amp;amp;amp; to protect it, the solution is simple, to own the other domain. 

Now, I can not tell you how many times I have seen people on social media try &amp;amp;amp; share our link or tell people about cashortrade and use the .com. It is outrageous. Also, we have run analytics on the .com. There are programs out there that show you traffic to better analyze. 

Now...going back say 6 years...to when we first began. As being kids on tour we first started with the catch phrase of cashortradeforyourextra.org and .com. But that was ridiculously long so we shortened it to cashforyourexta.org &amp;amp;amp; .com. But that was still long &amp;amp;amp; didn't include the trade which we wanted to be a key aspect...so we were hesitant because the .com was taken but we went for it anyway cashortrade.org. We continued to message the owner &amp;amp;amp; did research. We found out they paid $1800 for it so knew we were going to have to spend at least $2000 or so. We asked &amp;amp;amp; asked...&amp;amp;amp; no they would not sell. Then Bam, they launched a site. Not exactly like ours but trading of goods, &amp;amp;amp; back then cot involved everything not just tickets. We were pissed, but continued on. We then set up back orders on the domain to alert us when it became available. We watched it closely. Eventually the company who owned it, bidz.com let it go. The domain world is much like tickets &amp;amp;amp; a domain w/ the words a
cash and trade are worth a lot, so we knew it was going to be crazy. Sure enough we tried to buy it but someone already snuck in &amp;amp;amp; snatched it. They wanted $25,000. So we went back &amp;amp;amp; forgot about it. Until recently the Owner contacted me &amp;amp;amp; was open to $10,000. After some back and forth we agreed upon $5000. Knowing that the domain went for $1800 ten years ago we knew this was probably the best we were gonna get. So he agreed to sell it to us if we could raise the capital. He pointed the domain to a server of ours &amp;amp;amp; we started the fundraiser. 
So that's the long version. 
Again, I realize you don't think there is value in the domain, but I would have to disagree. Any business owner or investor would want to protect the branding of their company. Owning the .com is a must in expanding the idea for the future. 
I hope you can see where we are going w/ this and will donate a few bucks towards the cause. Thank for being a part of it.

4,"I appreciate your feedback however you obviously are commenting on something you know nothing about. Any web designer knows how to watch over the ""whois"" info of a domain and their expiration dates. We even paid for back-ordering so we could attempt to purchase it before others. Now... aside from that... obtaining the .com branding in very important to building a movement.  We can't continue to have people go to the wrong website and to share the wrong link.  Honestly, I am not sure this needs any explanation here.  eBay, Craigslist, and many other companies looking to obtain their whole brand own both the org and the com in an effort to direct interested parties to the correct location...and in our case...helping to build a MOVEMENT for face value tickets.  Lastly, as we grow the business and look for funding to hire developers and expand the project, investors require the .com.",2015-11-04 00:26:22+00:00,cwnk34u,2,t1_cwnj6fj,1367,phish
