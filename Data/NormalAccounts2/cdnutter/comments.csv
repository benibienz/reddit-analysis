143,"Yes. There are 4 ways.

OOTHax which requires Ocarina of Time 3D and Powersaves. A little expensive but works.

SmashHax which requires Smash Bros, Linux, a NEW 3DS, and an Internet Connection. I use this method because I don't own Ocarina of Time 3D or a powersave. It works but I need a laptop and internet connection for it to work which becomes a problem when I leave home.

Ninjahax which requires Cubic Ninja is the best method but pricey nowadays because people know about the permanent exploit. It is the BEST method to do.

IronHax which is similar to Ninjahax but requires the eShop game Ironfall which is no longer distributed. Use this if you have the game on your device but if you don't then you CANNOT use this method. 

I recommend SmashHax because majority own the game. I recommend this because Linux is pretty easy to get but if you have Cubic Ninja or can afford it use this as this is a permanent method as they are no longer selling Cubic Ninja.",2015-12-14 01:58:13+00:00,cxy6f5y,1.0,t3_3wq2w9,1266.0,3dshacks

169,"The Rugrats really were a figment of Angelica's Demonic and Unimaginable imagination.

Chuckie died in 1986 along with his mother, that's why Chaz is a nervous wreck all the time.

Tommy was born in 1988, but he was a stillborn, that's why Stu is constantly in the basement making toys for the son who never had a chance to live.

The DeVilles had an abortion in 1990, Angelica couldn't figure whether it would be a boy or a girl thus creating the twins.

As for ""All Grown Up"" the teenage Angelica became addicted to various narcotics which further aggravated her Schizophrenia, bringing her back to her childhood and thus her creations she obsessed over, because of time lapse between the present and the last time she interacted with her creations, she made them older. Angelica was constantly taking hits of acid, so she would never have to live without her creations who were her only company. In a judgmental world, Angelica's mom actually died of a heroine overdose in 1982 just after Angelica was born, and Drew in his depression married a gold digging whore that Angelica idolized because she fooled herself into thinking it was her real mom but always had a concept of her mom, Cynthia, and took a barbie doll and made it after her mom's image, wearing an unwashed orange dress and having jacked up hair, which is why she was so attached to it. Later in life she followed in her mom's footsteps with drugs and everything, dying of overdose at age 13 when All Grown Up! was ""cancelled"".

The only rugrat not to be fictional however, was unborn Tommy's brother Dil. However, Angelica didn't know the difference between Dil and her creations, although Dil didn't follow her commands. After endless crying and a refusal to disappear like the others did when Angelica was angry with them, she hit him. Due to this, he sustained a brain hemorrhage, which resulted in a deformation. As he grew up, his damage only became more evident and by the time he was 9 in ""All Grown Up!"" he lived as an outcast, being ridiculed for his weirdness and retardation. The immense guilt over this is what led Angelica to her drug use and is what led Angelica to un-create the Rugrats briefly, until her experience with hallucinogenics.

On a trip to Paris to find love, Chaz married a woman named Kira (He was actually going to marry a different woman named Coco, but she just wanted him for his money.) who had a daughter named Kimi that was torn from her because she was a cocaine addict (Angelica imagined her from Kira's stories). He lost his mind after the death of his wife and was in denial that she was ever prostitute. Upon return to America, Chaz and Kira married and she got her greencard. It was actually a really happy and romantic story. Kira continually struggled with addiction, but was relatively happy with her life and Chaz

Suzie was actually Angelica's only friend, who entertained the thought of Angelica's creations, for her sake. Angelica spent the last days of her life in the back of the school cafeteria, imagining friends around her and playing with the lives of her creations.
