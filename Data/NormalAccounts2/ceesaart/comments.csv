Russian alcoholism and the ""Mongoloid gene""

SCIENTISTS researching cures for alcoholism and hangovers say that they have found a genetic link between Russians’ traditional weakness for drink and the marauding Mongol armies.

in a test of Muscovites it was proven that they are infact descendants of mongolians / finish the Mongol genes are dominant genes in what we today call Russians..

Scientists foud out that the Mongolian genes make the Russians absorb more alcohol into the bloodstream and break it down at a slower rate than most Europeans.

That means that they get more drunk and have worse hangovers, and are more likely to become addicted to alcohol, given Russia’s taste for vodka, its harsh climate and the social and economic chaos after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Russians er nothing more then confused Mongolians that must have some sort of dimwit Syndrome thinking they are from Ukrainian Kiev Russ and Slavic background..

The DNA study of today's so called Russians shows that the historical facts are that Russians are Mongoloid / Finno-Ugric descendants and NOT Slavic like Ukrainians and polish people ...

The DNA evidence proves that Russians with out a doubt are Mongoloid / Finno-Ugric descendants ..

THE R1a explanation for dummy's Russians have is R1a-Z93 and is the main Asian branch of R1a.

Western and Northern European and also western Ukrainians have R1a -Z284 falls under the root R1a1a1* (M417), So this proves Russians are Asian NOT Europeans..

Russians er nothing more then Mongolians with Down Syndrome thinking they are from Kiev Russ and Slavic background when the DNA study of today's so called Russians shows that the historical facts are they they are Mongoloid / Finno-Ugric descendents and NOT Slavic...

The Mongolian Y-DNA (paternal) haplogroup R1a-Z93 and is the main Asian branch of R1a. and its offshoots are very common and the dominant gen among Russian men.

Studies have found the ethnic Russian frequency of R1a high as 62.7 percent, with an average of 46.7% of Russians in the ""Russia-DNA Project"" include R1a1, R1a1a, R1a1a1g, and R1a1a1g2.

RUSSIANS ARE NOT EAST EUROPEAN SLAVIC LIKE UKRAINIAN AND POLISH PEOPLE THE DNA TEST PROVES THIS FACT ..

Russians are Mongoloid / Finno-Ugric descendants and NOT Slavic like Ukrainians and Polish people .

The russians don't belong in disent european society but need to get on their horses and go back to asian steppes where they truly belong...

Chronology of Russian war crimes in Ukraine 
http://russiakills.com/en


http://www.friesian.com/russia.htm
In this:
""There is some controversy about the origin of the word Rus . Some Russian historians now prefer an independent and southern origin, from the river Ros near Kiev.""

""Early Russian history may therefore be said to have really been Ukrainian history.""..  soooooo  Ukraine isn't south russia but russia is in fact  north - Ukraine  , the backyard with the simple (to fool) people :-)

According to the famous historian Norman Davies, fascism, like communism, Putinisem, Naziissem ect ect can be defined by the following features:

* A pseudo-scientific conceptual basis (the belive of Russian 3rd Rom )

* A utopian goal (the Russiki Mir and Russians domanins of a new Russian world )

* A structure of a party-state (the restructure of the USSR borders )

* An autocratic leadership that demands complete devotion (Putinisem )

* Pervasive use of terror to prevent and eradicate dissent (East Ukraine , Syra chechnya, Moldova , Georgia, ect ect )

* Extensive and complex bureaucracy ( Using tax office to take out compatision )

* State propaganda and censorship (RT-News ect ect )

* Martial culture and aesthetics of force (The state and Russian belief in Russian superiority of Russian historical culture)

* Purposely induced fear of the ever-present external enemy (use state service like FSB, GRU to intimidate )

* Mentality of hate and intolerance (Anti othe ethnic grupes likeUkrainians, Muslims, Tatars , Kazakhstanis and others ect ect )

* Economic and mental collectivism (Putin has vast control over the gas and oil sectors and uses it as a political tool )

* Militarism (Rebuilding and promoting and using Military to attack and subdue the people like in the caucasus Chechnya ect ect )

* Messianism (Putin the half naked hours reading and bear wrestling superman is definitely believed by Russians to be a type of messiah, who acts as a savior, redeemer or liberator of a group of people.

* Contempt for liberal democracy and values (Putins regime is anti LGBT anti democracy Anti free press Anti free exspresion of art just look at-PussyRiot-and- Anna Politkovskaya ect ect )

* Moral nihilism ( is the meta-ethical view that nothing is intrinsically moral or immoral take a look how Russia lies about invading other nations and killing civilians and support of terrorism, and then turn abourd and say that it was to defend a grates good of Russia )

Clearly all of those are also characteristics of the Putin regime. Today in Russia, President Putin has the unquestionable control over Parliament, Government, courts, media and the most profitable sectors of the country's economy. To strengthen it further, he plans to reshuffle and consolidate the so-called ""silovoy blok"" – the repressive apparatus and intelligence service – by creating the new colossal iron-fist structure, the Ministry of the State Security.

So, we have every reason to declare that modern Russia is in fact, an authoritarian state with the genuine fascist elements, most prominently – the oppressive nature, the militarization of society, strict control over the mass media and complete disregard to human life

 Fourteen Defining 
Characteristics Of Fascism
By Dr. Lawrence Britt



Dr. Lawrence Britt has examined the fascist regimes of Hitler (Germany), Mussolini (Italy), Franco (Spain), Suharto (Indonesia) and several Latin American regimes. Britt found 14 defining characteristics common to each:
 
1. Powerful and Continuing Nationalism - Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.
 
2. Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights - Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of ""need."" The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.
 
3. Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause - The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.
 
4. Supremacy of the Military - Even when there are widespread
domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.
 
5. Rampant Sexism - The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Divorce, abortion and homosexuality are suppressed and the state is represented as the ultimate guardian of the family institution.
 
6. Controlled Mass Media - Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.
 
7. Obsession with National Security - Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.
 
8. Religion and Government are Intertwined - Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions.
 
9. Corporate Power is Protected - The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.
 
10. Labor Power is Suppressed - Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed.
 
11. Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts - Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked.
 
12. Obsession with Crime and Punishment - Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.
 
13. Rampant Cronyism and Corruption - Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.
 
14. Fraudulent Elections - Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.

No country should have vetorights, any country committing war acts - or crimes on its own or foreign citizens, without authorisating of UNGA should even be banned from voting at all.
Russia's war in Georgia, Ukraine, Syria and others and Assad war on its own citizens, Saudi Arabia warcrimes in Yemen could have been stopped then before they even started. And Syria that would have saved 500.000 people, and in Ukraine 10.000+ from death...

Grand Princes of Kiev

According to the descendant testing listed at the Russian Nobility DNA Project at FTDNA, the branch of the Rurik dynasty descended from Vladimir II Monomakh (Monomakhoviches) belong to Y-DNA haplogroup N1c1, while the branch descended from his presumed paternal cousin Oleg I of Chernigov (Olgoviches) belonged to R1a1a. The Y-DNA from the Proto-Rurikid branches is N1c1 and matches the distinctive haplotype of the Monomakhoviches. Furthermore, this N1c1 haplotype possess the distinctive value DYS390=23, found in Scandinavia but not in Uralic populations, confirming that this was indeed the original haplotype of the Varangian prince Rurik (c. 830-c. 879) who established the Kievan Rus'.

When it comes to firepower USA is uptoo in some cases 20 times the size of Russia ... Just take f. exs.

Aircraft carries USA has 20 Russia has 1 ( firepower USA 20 to 1)

Fighter aircraft USA has 2207 Russia 769

Fix wing aircraft USA has 13892 Russia has 3842

Helicopters USA 6196 Russia 1120

And lets not forget that all the USA weapons are tip top and high tec,. Russia for the most part has old soviet leftovers not so much new stuff some new stuff but not something worth worrying about ..

The truth is Russia is a analog watch in a digital age ...When it comes to the USA ...

ooo YES AND manpower

NATO has over 2,6 mill more soldiers under arms then Russia has

USA alone has 145,212,012 backup manpower available for military service and they are all professional soldiers ..

Russia only has 69,117,271 backup manpower available for military service For they most-part farm boys doing their national service

USA has today active serving military personnel 
1,400,000 The USA are battle harden professional soldiers ..

Russia has only active military personnel 
766,055 Most of them are farm boys doing their national service

AND IF WE PUT NATO INTO this mix we are talking fire power advantage up-too 19 times of Russia

Above is conventional weapons

Lets take also take into account nuclear weapons...

United Kingdom 225 warheads (submarine delivery systems new and up to date systems )

France 300 warheads
(submarine delivery systems new and up to date systems )

United States 7,315 warheads 
(Mixed delivery systems new and up to date systems )

Russia 8,000 warheads
(Mixed delivery systems old mostly from the soviet union times NOT up to date systems )

http://www.icanw.org/the-facts/nuclear-arsenals/

A look at the link for the total number of nuclear warheads worldwide, the number of deployed warheads, and the countries that possess reactors, warheads, uranium mining or other atomic facilities.

http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_submarine_Kursk_%28K-141%29

Base on this facts Russia does not stand a chance as most of NATO warheads are on Subs. and NOT in silos like Russia that makes it easy to take out with NATOs defiance systems ...

All NATO must do is take out Moscow and 5 -6 other city's to take out all of Russia.... But Russia must take out city's all over the planet from USA , CANADA ,FRANCE UK. ALL OF EUROPE and as fare away as , AUSTRALIA and so on and so on ...

PS. lets not forget the the Submarine KURSK was part of Russia's nuclear weapons platform and it was falling apart to such an degree that its systems torpedo systems on the Sub. malfunctions and blow up under water and sank the sub and .. killed all of its crew ....

Now if that is what Russia's nuclear delivery platform and weapons platform is like all I can say is hahahahahaha and lest us not forget that Kursk was the pride and joy of Russia's navy... What does the rest of the Russian nuclear weapons program look like if Kursk is anything to go by ?

I mean...... If you can not hold your submarines floating in 
pace time what hope do you really have for holding yoursubmarines floating in war time ?



Kursk was an Oscar-class submarine, twice the length of a 747 jumbo jet, and one of the largest submarines in the Russian Navy.

An official investigation after most of the wreck was raised along with analysis of pieces of debris concluded that a faulty weld in the casing of the practice torpedo caused high-test peroxide (HTP) to leak, which caused the kerosene fuel to explode. The initial explosion destroyed the torpedo room, severely damaged the control room, incapacitated or killed the control room crew, and caused the submarine to sink with all of its nuks not much of a nuclear weapons platform now was it hahaha

How Powerful Is Russia? https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_2278250865&amp;feature=iv&amp;list=PLS0CO0PT_kELlH499yWSzBzW_rciIGkNZ&amp;src_vid=_AdkT2QrJ8M&amp;v=9vX-_hjx_go

For YOU and Trolls like you who like to repeat Russian propaganda about how Russia could have tanks in Kiev in two weeks, take a second to reflect on the numbers. As of 2015, Russia has 230K troops in ground forces (there's also a huge number of other people, but they are not authorized to use weapons), and Ukraine has 204K. Plus 40-50K Ukrainian National Guard.

This is public information - easy to verify on the Wikipedia. Russia would need some troops at the border with five NATO countries, some troops at the long border with China, some at bases in Armenia, Transnistria, Abkhazia, Ossetia, etc. Let's say half can be sent to Ukraine - that's 115K - less than half of Ukrainian army + National Guard.

With the type of brute-force war that Russia trains for, a successful attack needs a 3-4x advantage in troops.

So, Russia simply does not have enough troops. Holding the territory (even just to the left of Dnieper) would require an order of magnitude more troops. In the meantime, Ukraine is producing a number of new weapons and is getting a number of defensive systems from other countries. For example, Ukraine is now mass-producing portable anti-tank weapons with 5km range, which makes traditional armor attacks Russia practices much more problematic. Not to mention a large number of Soviet-era tanks in Ukraine, and some new ones produced now. Another example, US-made anti-artillery systems have been used in combat and are going to be available in larger quantities. If Russia tries a full-scale invasion, this may indeed end in two weeks, but not in Russia's favor.

Putin will not use Nuclear weapons

1.if he did then he will be not just nuking kyiv the blast and fall out will also hit East Ukraine, Crimea , Poland Belorussia and Russia

2.He will get the orthodox church agenst him for taking out Pecerska Lavra center of orthodox faith in the world and the far right orthodox is his power base at home

3. How will it look if he bombed Russians in Ukraine

4.if he did this then any friends he has in the international community will run for cover and distance then self s from him and and RuSSia in every way they can they will admit openly that Putin is a mad man that needs too-be taken out asap..even his god old buddy in Syria Assad will not return his phone calls and run for cover.

5. Russia will become a international outcast and pariah in diplomatic relations with the rest of the world..

6.The world will respond with an attack on Russia and Putin and Moscow will only be left in history books just like the soviet union is now ...

7.Putin like Hitler and Stalin is a very smart calculated psychopath he is not crazy or insane and does not have a political death wish or any other type of death wish for that matter he pushes as fare as he feels he can and then backs down if he feels he gets pushed back and if he dose not get pushed back he continues until he dose.

En daarom zal Obama een wetsvoorstel met z'n veto treffen dat toestaat dat 9/11 slachtoffer families Saudi Arabie voor t gerecht laat slepen, want de opdrachtgever was de USA govt. Hillary Clinton heeft meerdere keren gezegd dat Al-Qaida door de USA is opgericht, Osama Bin Laden was een Saudi, en toch viel Bush Iraq aan? 

In 1999 werden plannen bekend gemaakt  om het Amerikaans leger met 30% in te krimpen en voila we kregen 9/11 en AL-Qaida. In 2013 werden plannen bekend gemaakt om het Amerikaans leger tot het niveau van voor 1942 te brengen, en daarmee ook de defensie industrie te raken weer, 
vervolg - en voila we kregen IS, rusland die Ukraine's Crimea binnenviel, terwijl Amerikaanse oorlogschepen stiekem de Zwarte Zee verlieten om  de Russen niet in de weg te zitten, later viel Rusland ook oost-Ukraine binnen en Obama weigerde het een jaar lang een invasie te noemen, en Obama weet dat achter IS Saudia Arabie en de Golfstaten zitten met hun salafistische islam, die veel wapens kopen van VS. Maar dat is allemaal toeval?

Het Oekrainse leger heeft vanaf het begin enkel teruggeschoten na een overtreding van de kant van de russische invallers vanuit Rusland.

Bewijs hiervoor is dat de russiche invallers van Minsk 1, en 2 steeds meer terrein hebben ingenomen, nu 7% van Ukrains grondgebied, ongeveer 30% van de provincies(oblast) Donetsk en Luhansk. (naast geheel Crimea dankzij nietsdoen van VS,VK en EU)

Daarom zijn er ook VS/EU sancties tegen  personen en bedrijven in RUSLAND, waaronder tegen het ministerie van Defensie.

Bovendien hebben de door NOS genoemde rebellen, beschikking over meer (Russische)wapens dan een aantal EU/NATO landen bij elkaar.

In every country in the world the common people which is in every country at least 85%, make the 15% richer richer while they get poorer, 
That's the 15% this article speaks about who make money on other peoples misfortune whether being refugee, dependent people you name it. 
Those 15% can be divided in subgroups of which the socalled 1% is best known, they are the richest and are the people behind political parties so rule the countries.
The 7% group (in fact 6%+the 1%) are the sub-richest.
The 8% group are the real parasites, the NGO's and socalled charities.

These numbers may differ a bit for each country.

Up till now there's not ONE party, in whatever country, who looks after the needs of the 85%!
Most parties towards elections promise the 85% a lot, and forget that after elections, for whatever reason.
(Oh economy so bad, sorry;  Really, aren't you in charge to make that happen?)

Therefore, instead of better communication, we need better politics, and less NGO's and parasites.

214,"A Year After His Death, What I Wish I Could Tell the Ukrainian Soldier I Befriended
by Nolan Peterson
former special operations pilot and a combat veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan, now The Daily Signal’s foreign correspondent based in Ukraine
One year ago a 19-year-old Ukrainian soldier named Daniel Kasyanenko died on a battlefield in eastern Ukraine. He died alongside one of his friends, a fellow Ukrainian volunteer soldier, when a mortar fell on them. They were among 18 Ukrainian soldiers to die in a 10-day stretch from Aug. 1 to Aug. 10, 2015.
I first met Daniel two months before his death, while I was embedded with the Ukrainian army’s 93rd Brigade in a front-line village called Pisky, just outside the Donetsk airport. The morning I departed the front lines to return to Kyiv, I was supposed to meet Daniel for one last goodbye. I waited in the courtyard of a bullet-ridden, shrapnel-shredded, abandoned home, but he never showed up.
I assumed he had been delayed by some soldierly duty, and I didn’t think much of his missing my departure, other than feeling a vague sense of regret for not having one more chance to shake his hand and wish him well.",2016-09-02 15:06:16+00:00,d76tl6n,1.0,t3_50to0m,50.0,russiawarinukraine

229,"extra:

Volgens de Franse socialistische prominent Julien Dray is de foto waarschijnlijk geënsceneerd. Je ziet op de prent een moslimvrouw op het strand van Nice die door agenten wordt gedwongen haar hoofddoek af te doen. Nep of niet, de foto is zo ongeveer door alle media in de wereld gepubliceerd en wordt zelfs door IS voor propagandadoeleinden gebruikt. Bijna nergens wordt vermeld dat volgens peilingen 64 procent van de Fransen vóór boerkini-verbod is en maar 6 tegen, maar dat terzijde.

Of van het gewelddadige incident op het strandje Bain-des-Dames bij Chateauneuf (West-Frankrijk) foto's bestaan, is niet bekend. Om inzicht in het voorval te krijgen, moet je regionale kranten als de Charente Libre raadplegen. Afgelopen donderdag wordt een jonge moeder door een andere vrouw op haar badkleding aangesproken: deze vrouw draagt het bovenstuk van haar bikini niet. Topless baden is niet verboden, maar wordt kennelijk niet door iedereen als decent beschouwd. Er ontstaat een ruzie en de klaagster krijgt versterking van haar mannelijke familieleden. Met zes mannen tegelijk wordt de vrouw op de grond geworpen, geslagen en haar bikinibroekje uitgetrokken. Nu helemaal naakt voor haar eigen huilende kinderen, met een bloedneus en blauw oog, druipt ze uiteindelijk af. Over de identiteit van de daders wordt door de gendarmes niets gemeld, maar het zou hier niet gaan om een religieus motief.

Je zult hier niets over lezen in The New York Times: een blanke vrouw zonder boerkini die omwille van haar blote borsten wordt afgeranseld, past niet in de huidige sfeer van mediaverontwaardiging. Bovendien zijn de jaren zestig voorgoed voorbij en is topless baden nu verdacht. Behalve als je de clausule 'godsdienstvrijheid' in werking kunt stellen. Tevergeefs natuurlijk, want de eerste blote-tietenkerk moet nog worden gebouwd.

De tijdgeest wordt voor vrouwen steeds grimmiger. 'Bedek je!', is het parool en als je in 'gevoelige' buurten niet wil worden lastiggevallen of zelfs verkracht, kun je beter wijde joggingpakken dragen. Meer dan ooit is het vrouwenlichaam in al zijn naaktheid geen bron van (kunstzinnige) inspiratie meer of de expressie van vrijheid, maar een object van schaamte en perversie.

Om deze verandering te illustreren plaatste ik afgelopen weekeinde op Facebook een fotomontage die ik tegen was gekomen. Links, de beroemde PSP-poster 'ontwapenend' uit 1971 met de naakte vrouw en de koe in een weiland. Rechts, een kiekje uit 2014 waarop drie Almeerse vrouwelijke raadsleden met hoofddoek op voor een poster poseren waarop staat: 'GroenLinks, zin in de toekomst'. Binnen 24 uur kreeg de montage honderden likes. Na 24 uur werd het ook door de zedenpolitie van Facebook opgemerkt en verwijderd. Wat in 1971 mocht, is in deze tijd van bloeiend sexofascisme reden tot verbod en uitsluiting. Wat Facebook in ieder geval niet kan tegenhouden is een oproep van verontwaardigde Franse vrouwen om woensdag bij Bain-des-Dames massaal topless te gaan baden.

261,"This video was made just a few days ago, on August 12, 2016 in Sevastopol, Crimea. Putin’s biker friend by the nick-name Hirurg (Surgeon) organized and narrated a show about a “mighty Russia” as a Fifth Reich. In the video they claimed “Novorussia”, south-east of Ukraine, Donbass, Karabah and Syria as Russian land. This part of the video is an insert from the end of the show, that depicts Russian nostalgia for the USSR and their desire to return it back. 

At the end of his poem “Hirurg” compares Russia to Noah’s Ark to save humanity and concludes with the words “Russia will save the West.” 
Russians already went to “save” Ukraine and now we know how much death and destruction they brought there. Now, they are getting ready to “save” the rest of the world. With each year Russia is becoming a fascist state. 

Something needs to be done immediately to stop Russia before Russian Hitler (Putin) will go with the war to conquer the world. Ukraine is already crying with their own blood as the rest of the world stands by the side and watches. If we don’t stop Russians now it will be much harder to stop later. Together we can stop Russian fascism.

The Bible and history and Biblical archaeology

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_archaeology

According to one of the world'ss leading biblical archaeologists, William G. Dever

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_G._Dever

Archaeology certainly doesn't prove literal readings of the Bible;It calls them into question, and thats what bothers some people. Most people really think that archaeology is out there to prove the Bible. No archaeologist thinks so.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Bible#cite_note-34

From the beginnings of what we call biblical archeology, perhaps 150 years ago, scholars, mostly western scholars, have attempted to use archeological data to prove the Bible. And for a long time it was thought to work. William F. Albright  
 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_F._Albright, the great father of our discipline, often spoke of the &amp;#8220;archeological revolution.Well, the revolution has come but not in the way that Albright thought. The truth of the matter today is that archeology raises more questions about the historicity of the Hebrew Bible and even the New Testament than it provides answers, and thats very disturbing to some people.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Bible#cite_note-35

Dever also wrote:

Archaeology as it is practiced today must be able to challenge, as well as confirm, the Bible stories. Some things described there really did happen, but others did not. The biblical narratives about Abraham  

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon 

probably reflect some historical memories of people and places, but the larger than life portraits of the Bible are unrealistic and contradicted by the archaeological evidence.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Bible#cite_note-36

I am not reading the Bible as Scripture… I am in fact not even a theist. My view all along—and especially in the recent books—is first that the biblical narratives are indeed stories, often fictional and almost always propagandistic, but that here and there they contain some valid historical information

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Bible#cite_note-37

Tel Aviv University  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv_University  archaeologist Ze'ev Herzog  

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ze%27ev_Herzog wrote in the Haaretz  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haaretz newspaper:

This is what archaeologists have learned from their excavations in the Land of Israel: the Israelites were never in Egypt, did not wander in the desert, did not conquer the land in a military campaign and did not pass it on to the 12 tribes of Israel. Perhaps even harder to swallow is that the united monarchy of David and Solomon, which is described by the Bible as a regional power, was at most a small tribal kingdom. And it will come as an unpleasant shock to many that the God of Israel, EL later YHWH, had a female consort (Aserah) and that the early Israelite religion adopted monotheism only in the waning period of the monarchy and not at Mount Sinai.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Bible#cite_note-38

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Bible#cite_note-39

Professor Israel Finkelstein  

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Finkelstein

who is known as the father of biblical archaeology, told the Jerusalem Post  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_Post

that Jewish archaeologists have found no historical or archaeological evidence to back the biblical narrative on The Exodus  
 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exodus the Jews wandering in Sinai or Book of Joshua  
 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Joshua
 
conquest of Canaan. On the alleged Temple of Solomon, Finkelstein said that there is no archaeological evidence to prove it really existed.
 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Bible#cite_note-middleeastmonitor.org.uk-40
 
Professor Yoni Mizrahi, an independent archaeologist who has worked with the International Atomic Energy Agency, agreed with Israel Finkelstein

Regarding The Exodus  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exodus  

of Israelites from Egypt, 

Egyptian archaeologist Zahi Hawass  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zahi_Hawass said:

“Really, it’s a myth. This is my career as an archaeologist. I should tell them the truth. If the people are upset, that is not my problem.”

Prophet said Jews, Christians and Muslims are people of the BOOK not books! Or are you a infidel, a non-believer? Prophet said the same as Tom Holland and Turkish scientists Muazzez_İlmiye_Çığ, last wrote all present and lot of past came from Sumer in her  book 1995: Kur'an, İncil ve Tevrat'ın Sümer'deki Kökeni [The Origins of the Koran, the Bible and the Torah in Sumer] . Btw Quran was not ""born"" in Mecca but in Syria, on the trips of Prophet with his uncle to Bahira.  Yazidi's are link between western and eastern religions, cause he kept parts of their oldest in their rituals for everyone to see.

Before  religious patriarchy there was nature-mothergodess-sun-ancestor worship and it was a time of peace, according scientists war-religious patriarchy and statehood started between 5500/3500 BCE.
""Marrying"" young girls is a ancient Middle East/North-Africa custom that was incorporated in Jewish and Muslim religions, in Islam it's given as example given by the Prophet, so like it's approved by ""God"".
In Jewish writings you see that they even allow (by ""God"" again) sex  with girls as young as 3, as long as it's a Jew with a gentile/infidel (nonbeliever), in christian writings you will find that and polygamy  in Old Testament (plagerism from Jewish writing) also, not in New Testament.  Islam and Judaism are closer in customs together.

302,"The Ottoman penetration into Europe in the 1350s and their capture of Constantinople later in 1453 opened new floodgates for slave-trade from the European front. In their last attempt to overrun Europe in 1683, the Ottoman army, although defeated, returned from the Gates of Vienna with 80,000 captives.874 An immense number of slaves flowed from the Crimea, the Balkans and the steppes of West Asia to Islamic markets. BD Davis laments that the ‘‘Tartars and other Black Sea peoples had sold millions of Ukrainians, Georgians, Circassians, Greeks, Armenians, Bulgarians, Slavs and Turks,’’ which received little notice.875 Crimean Tatars enslaved and sold some 1,750,000 Ukrainians, Poles and Russian between 1468 and 1694. 876 According to another estimate, between 1450 and 1700, the Crimean Tatars exported some 10,000 slaves, including some Circassians, annually—that is, some 2,500,000 slaves in all, to the Ottoman Empire.877 The Tatar slave-raiding Khans returned with 18,000 slaves from Poland (1463), 100,000 from Lvov (1498), 60,000 from South Russia (1515), 50,000–100,000 from Galicia (1516), during the ‘harvesting of the steppe.’ Numbers from Moscow (1521), 800,000 were taken and from Valynia (1676), 400,000 were taken. 800,000 from Moscow (1521), 200,000 from South Russia (1555), 100,000 from Moscow (1571), 50,000 from Poland (1612), 60,000 from South Russia (1646), 100,000 from Poland (1648), 300,000 from Ukraine (1654), 400,000 from Valynia (1676) and thousands from Poland (1694). Besides these major catches, they made countless more Jihad raids during the same period, which yielded a few to tens of thousands of slaves.878 These figures of enslavement must be considered in the context that the population of the Tatar Khanate was only about 400,000 at the time. (1463-1694) while sources are incomplete, conservative tabulation of the slave raids against the Eastern European population indicate that at least 7 Million European people-men, women, children were enslaved by Muslims.

Sources suggest that in the few years between 1436-1442, some 500,000 people were seized in the Balkans. Many of the captives died in forced marches towards Anatolia (Turkey). Contemporary chronicles note that the Ottomans reduced masses of the inhabitants of Greece, Romania, and the Balkans to slavery eg from Moree (1460)-70,000 and Transylvania (1438) - 60,000-70,000 and 300,000-600,000 from Hungary and 10,000 from Mytilene/Mitilini on Lesbos island (1462) (Bulgaru p 567) and so it continued.

Barbary Slavery
Ohio State University history Professor Robert Davis describes the White Slave Trade as minimized by most modern historians in his book Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast and Italy, 1500–1800 (Palgrave Macmillan). Davis estimates that 1 million to 1.25 million white Christian Europeans were enslaved in North Africa, from the beginning of the 16th century to the middle of the 18th, by slave traders from Tunis, Algiers, and Tripoli alone (these numbers do not include the European people which were enslaved by Morocco and by other raiders and traders of the Mediterranean Sea coast), 16th- and 17th-century customs statistics suggest that Istanbul's additional slave import from the Black Sea may have totaled around 2.5 million from 1450 to 1700. The markets declined after the loss of the Barbary Wars and finally ended in the 1830s, when the region was conquered by France.

In 1544, the island of Ischia off Naples was ransacked, taking 4,000 inhabitants prisoners, while some 9,000 inhabitants of Lipari Island off the north coast of Sicily were enslaved.870 Turgut Reis, a Turkish pirate chief, ransacked the coastal settlements of Granada (Spain) in 1663 and carried away 4,000 people as slaves. 

The barbaric slave-raiding activities of the Muslim pirates had a telling effect on Europe. France, England, and Spain lost thousands of ships, devastating to their sea-borne trade. Long stretches of the coast in Spain and Italy were almost completely abandoned by their inhabitants until the nineteenth century. The finishing industry was virtually devastated.

Paul Baepler’s White Slaves, African Masters: An Anthology of American Barbary Captivity Narratives lists a collection of essays by nine American captives held in North Africa. According to his book, there were more than 20,000 white Christian slaves by 1620 in Algiers alone; their number swelled to more than 30,000 men and 2,000 women by the 1630s. There were a minimum of 25,000 white slaves at any time in Sultan Moulay Ismail’s palace, records Ahmed ez-Zayyani; Algiers maintained a population of 25,000 white slaves between 1550 and 1730, and their numbers could double at certain times. During the same period, Tunis and Tripoli each maintained a white slave population of about 7,500. The Barbary pirates enslaved some 5,000 Europeans annually over a period of nearly three centuries.",2016-08-03 16:19:17+00:00,d62mrsz,1.0,t3_4vzb0a,144.0,russiawarinukraine

315,"Sex and Punishment: Four Thousand Years of Judging Desire Kindle Edition
by Eric Berkowitz  (Author)
https://www.amazon.com/Sex-Punishment-Thousand-Judging-Desire-ebook/dp/B007VC29EK/thesign

the “raging frenzy” of the sex drive, to use Plato’s phrase, has always defied control. However, that’s not to say that the Sumerians, Victorians, and every civilization in between and beyond have not tried, wielding their most formidable weapon: the law. At any given point in time, some forms of sex were condoned while others were punished mercilessly. Jump forward or backward a century or two (and often far less than that), and the harmless fun of one time period becomes the gravest crime in another. Judging Desire tells the story of the struggle throughout the millennia to regulate the most powerful engine of human behavior.

Twee Amerikaanse genetici hebben nu de lengte van die zesde dag wat nader gepreciseerd: 240 tot 320 miljoen jaar. Dat is de tijdspanne waarover volgens Bruce Lahn en David Page van het Whitehead instituut in Cambridge (VS) de menselijke geslachtchromosomen X en Y - die in hun samenspel bepalen wie vrouw (XX) of man (XY) wordt - zich hebben ontwikkeld tot wat ze nu zijn (Science van 29 oktober).Volgens Page, kenner bij uitstek van het 'mannelijke' Y-chromosoom, en Lahn is het kleine Y-chromosoom, met maar een paar dozijn genen erop, geëvolueerd uit het veel grotere X-chromosoom, dat duizenden genen herbergt. Voordien waren beide chromosomen gewone autosomen zonder seksebepalende eigenschappen.Die evolutie is in vier stappen verlopen, aldus Lahn en Page. De eerste stap, 240 tot 320 miljoen jaar geleden, viel samen met de evolutionaire scheiding van vogels en zoogdieren. De tweede stap werd 130 tot 170 miljoen jaar geleden gezet, tegelijkertijd met de evolutie van het vogelbekdier. De derde en vierde stap, 80 tot 130 miljoen jaar en 30 tot 50 miljoen jaar geleden, vielen samen met de ontwikkeling van de kangaroe en de lemuur, een primaat.Het menselijke X- en Y chromosoom delen nu nog slechts 19 zogeheten 'X-Y genen'. Page sluit niet uit dat de beide geslachtchromosomen in het komende eon nog verder uit elkaar zullen drijven.

http://liveuamap.com/en/2016/25-july-the-russian-government-will-equate-kolovrat-to-the
Kolovrat (symbol), a Slavic pagan symbol of the Sun, similar to the swastika.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swastika#Slavic

The earliest known swastika-like symbol dates from around 10,000-13,000 BC. It appears on a late paleolithic figurine of a bird, carved from mammoth ivory, which was found in Mezine, Ukraine. The bird was found with a number of phallic objects which is consistent with the idea that the swastika pattern was used as a fertility symbol.[23] However it has also been suggested that this swastika may be a stylized picture of a stork in flight and not the true swastika that is in use today.[24]

Among the earliest cultures utilizing swastika is the neolithic Vinča culture of South-East Europe (see Vinča symbols)

According to painter Stanisław Jakubowski the ""little sun"" is an Early Slavic pagan symbol of the sun. It was engraved on wooden monuments built near the final resting places of fallen Slavs to represent eternal life.[61] The symbol was first seen in a collection of Early Slavic symbols and architectural features drawn and compiled by Polish painter Stanisław Jakubowski, which he named Prasłowiańskie motywy architektoniczne (Polish: Early Slavic Architectural Motifs).[61] His work was published in 1923, by a publishing house that was then based in the Dębniki district of Kraków.[61] The symbol can also be found on embroidery and pottery in most Slavic countries.

Kolovrat (symbol), a Slavic pagan symbol of the Sun, similar to the swastika.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swastika#Slavic

The earliest known swastika-like symbol dates from around 10,000-13,000 BC. It appears on a late paleolithic figurine of a bird, carved from mammoth ivory, which was found in Mezine, Ukraine. The bird was found with a number of phallic objects which is consistent with the idea that the swastika pattern was used as a fertility symbol.[23] However it has also been suggested that this swastika may be a stylized picture of a stork in flight and not the true swastika that is in use today.[24]

Among the earliest cultures utilizing swastika is the neolithic Vinča culture of South-East Europe (see Vinča symbols)

According to painter Stanisław Jakubowski the ""little sun"" is an Early Slavic pagan symbol of the sun. It was engraved on wooden monuments built near the final resting places of fallen Slavs to represent eternal life.[61] The symbol was first seen in a collection of Early Slavic symbols and architectural features drawn and compiled by Polish painter Stanisław Jakubowski, which he named Prasłowiańskie motywy architektoniczne (Polish: Early Slavic Architectural Motifs).[61] His work was published in 1923, by a publishing house that was then based in the Dębniki district of Kraków.[61] The symbol can also be found on embroidery and pottery in most Slavic countries.

answer was: east-Ukraine  rofl ol, so I replied as name states its east of Ukraine, and you can't invade own country , only defend it against invaders.

Answer I got was but Ukraine is no country, it's just south -Russia.
I replied: nope:
1. Ukraine was already a country with cities when Muscovy was still marshlands.
2. Russia as such is no country, its official name is RF russian federation, has 85 parts.
3. As far as (russian) historians say: Muscovy-Russia may be regarded as North-Ukraine.
4. Name  RUS was stolen from Ukraine who are heirs of Kyvian-Rus, besides in 1721 Muscovy changed nameto Russia to please Prussia..

Clinton's trip may not have achieved anything else worthwhile, but it did provide blinding proof that his policy on European security is exactly backward.""

Before people had 1000's of years of Nature-, Ancestor-, Mothergoddess- and Sun worship, when people still looked at Nature and lived accordingly. (Mother Earth, Mother Nature, Mother Sun). Oldest mothergoddess figure is dated 833.000 BCE.

All major religions started around 700 BCE from same sources.
Yeah despite jews f.i. saying it were 1000's of years, they plagerised a lot: read Sholmo Sandd, a jew and his book : the invention of the jewish people  and also invention of Israel.

Also Bible was invented borrowing a lot from other people's religions/beliefs, f.i. from Persian Manichism, Zarahoestra and Mithras, thats why christian holy day is SUN-day.
They borrowed a bit from Judaism also, the entire Old Testament is copied from them.
Christians have 10 commandments, Jews 613.

In one thing the Prophet was right, the Abrahamic religions, have in essence the same
BOOK, not books.

And if you want proof of that, besides the words of Prophet himself,  everyone is familar with the sentence: Thy children of Israel?

No wonder it comes 738 times in Thorah he? Or 7 times in christian Bible.
But most people don't know same sentence is also in the Quran.
TWENTYFIVE times...

So it's save to say jews and muslims are closer to eachother religion-wise then most of them know.  (Or wish:-) )
And even closer then jews and christians...

The so called Golden rule  is in fact copied from egypt and jews:
Do for one who may do for you, / That you may cause him thus to do."" - The Tale of the Eloquent Peasant, Ancient Egypt, 1970- 1640 BCE.
later rabbi Hilliel was asked to explain the Thorah and Talmoed in one sentence and he replied: What is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow. The rest is commentary. (70 BCE)",2016-07-17 14:07:41+00:00,d5fm8dq,1.0,t3_4t6ge8,61678.0,russiawarinukraine

434,"In 2007 Council of Europe calculated that cost of domestic/sexual violence in Europe, 
besides the PAIN of being victim, in lost working days/reintegration, healthcare cost is 
500 euro for each citizen (in 2007 340 billion !! for whole of Europe) 
you can easily recalculate that for your country.
Besides this domestic violence is the largest (deadly) violence crime in Europe! (and elsewhere)
(even more then organized crime) Why is that not adressed by politicians?
F.i. in Netherlands it affects every year more then half a million (mostly women &amp; children) on 17 million, and that for several years. For Netherlands thats a cost of 8.5 billion a year.

Think what can be saved in any country if that violence (and war) can be prevented !! Besides pain of the victims and their children and family offcourse.


Domestic (sexual) violence comes from (religious) patriarchy state, around 
5500 BCE/3100 BCE, before 1000's of years of Nature-, Ancestor-, Mothergoddess- and Sun worship, when people still looked at Nature and lived accordingly. (Mother Earth, Mother Nature, Mother Sun). Oldest mothergoddess figure is dated 833.000 BCE.

Patriarchy took people away from Nature and was more abstract (most using a male Sun abstract God like Christianity) and with state, also reason of war.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War
Since the rise of the state some 5,000 years ago, military activity has occurred over much of the globe. The advent of gunpowder and the acceleration of technological advances led to modern warfare. According to Conway W. Henderson, ""One source claims that 14,500 wars have taken place between 3500 BC and the late 20th century, costing 3.5 billion lives, leaving only 300 years of peace (Beer 1981: 20).""

about violence/war and from that domestic/sexual violence as a society/education problem and where it all came from : (religious) patriarchy.

So there's no religion of peace, cause all present religions are patriarchial, and all from a single source if you look into history of religion.

I could also have mentioned religious violence, and then most will think of IS, but then again on their behavior towards women, and I don't have to remind anyone of Inquisition, witchhunt and the killing of Völva, holy women in Viking culture, in the course of Christianization, which also led to an extreme polarization of the role of females in Germanic society.

Ukrainian journalist Nastya Melnychenko’s Facebook post prompts others to share stories of sexual harassment and violence.

On July 14, Facebook suspended the account of Melnichenko. (shortly)

“[Facebook administrators] sent me a notification yesterday, saying that I'd supposedly posted something that doesn't comply with Facebook's rules. And then it turned out that my account had been suspended temporarily, to check to make sure it's not fake,” Melnichenko said, the Meduza news website reported.

Melnichenko suspects that this was probably due to a barrage of coordinated complaints about her account made by Facebook users, according to the news source. “It's clear that this is connected to the flash mob,” she told Meduza. “It's just that Facebook is my personal mass-media outlet. I use it to communicate with the world, and so I'm in a state of mild panic right now.”

436,"Rights activists have gathered vital evidence of direct shelling and military intervention from Russia in 2014 which they intend to pass to the International Criminal Court in the Hague.  The material is important in demonstrating that the conflict is of an international nature.  This will help victims defend their rights in international courts and also to refute the ongoing attempts to present the fighting in Donbas as a ‘civil war’. 

The material compiled by the International Partnership for Human Rights [IPHR] pertains to the summer and autumn of 2014.  It is based on interviews with 45 witnesses and the IPHR’s own field investigations, as well as satellite images from the independent Bellingcat investigative initiative and OSCE monitoring mission reports. 

Compelling evidence was found that:

Five villages: Kolesnykivka, Komyshne, Milove, Dmytrivka and Pobeda were shelled from Russian territory;

Fighters from the Russian Federation took part in attacks on the villages of Kolesnykivka, Komyshne, Milove, Krasna Talivka, Dmytrivka and Pobeda.  There were confirmed attacks on civilian objects (rather than military infrastructure and border units) in Kolesnykivka and Komyshne.  These fall under Article 8.2(b) and (v) of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.

Russia has consistently denied any involvement in the military conflict and continues to claim that any fighters either caught or whose engagement cannot be seriously disputed are ‘volunteers’. 

This report is clearly vital in demolishing such denials.  It points out that satellite images, reports from eyewitnesses and on social networks indicate that the attacks did not come from some anonymous ‘volunteers’, but from Russian military units on the Russian side of the border.",2016-07-11 12:37:33+00:00,d57s4a3,1.0,t3_4saoji,248.0,russiawarinukraine

A regular referendum can now not be held, since Crimea is occupied, so first ALL russian soldiers should leave Crimea, yes incl. that of bases on Crimea, CAUSE Russia itself renounced agreement with Ukraine which would run untill 2042 on lease of bases.
Which chance you think Russia would have to ever come back to Crimea, even to its bases ? NONE

And if Ukraine would then say well let's have no referendum, which legal instruments  would Russia have to overturn that? NONE, cause Russia has no historic or legal claim on its Crimean bases and/or even Crimea.

Putin would have been much cleverer if he under yanakovich promoted  federalization of Ukraine and let every region held referendum on joining russia, no deaths - no sanctions -no billions lost...now since money runs dry he will try ""last"" offensive in september since his Minsk-trap was turned by Ukraine in a Putin-trap.....

Italy’s Desperate Banks
Still another bailout drama for the European Union.
""Italy faces an acute banking crisis, and again the country’s political class is finding somebody else to blame. There’s Britain, for injecting uncertainty into the European economy by voting to leave the European Union. There’s Germany, for vetoing Prime Minister Matteo Renzi’s plea for an emergency €40 billion ($44.27 billion) taxpayer-funded bank bailout. And there’s the euro, for preventing the country from devaluing its way out of its debts.""

According to Federal Reserve and IMF officials, the bank has failed a stress test by U.S. Fed and is now deemed the biggest source of risk among global systemically important banks.""

How to Trade the Deutsche Bank Collapse
With the mainstream media focused on global growth concerns after the Brexit vote, let’s face reality. The Brexit should prove itself to be a major turning point in history. Europe is heading towards a major contagion event.

The European Commission (EC), believing it’s an elitist hierarchy, has overstepped the line. The undemocratic and unelected bureaucracy has tried to federalise Europe by sheer political agenda

The European banking collapse is next
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) knows a major financial meltdown is looming. Of course, it will never tell you that.

Grow up, and realize voting does matter (CNN doesn't :-) )  Personally in 1982 with my just ONE vote, I kept a local politican that I had issues with, from electing himself to a higher provincial body and ofc I happily informed him, that the one vote he came short, was MINE. So I guess , he has put me on ""Sheldon's "" mortal enemies list :-)

And yes , certain rules should be in place for very important elections and/or referendums, but only before and not afterwards, when outcome doesn't suit the ones that lost.

Besides, comparing this referendum and Dutch EU-Ukraine AA:
This 72% turnout, leaving 52%, remain 48%.
Dutch referendum: Turnout 32,2% !!!  , 
61,1 of 32,2%=19,3 % against, 38.1 of 32.2= 13% in favor... 77% didnt vote.

Which is more valid? And why we still hear 61.1% of dutch were against, it were just 19,3%...
Dutch goverment should have said its just 19% against, and its just advising so its not valid!

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT RUSSIANS ARE NOT SLAVIC IT IS A MYTH AND RUSSIANS ARE NOT EUROPIAN THAT IS ALSO A MYTH FACT RUSSIANS ARE MONGOLIAN / FINISH DECENT !!

The russians don't belong in decent European Society but need to get on their horses and go back to Aslan steppes where they truly belong...

RUSSIANS ARE NOT EAST EUROPEAN SLAVIC LIKE UKRAINIAN AND POLISH PEOPLE THE DNA TEST PROVES THIS FACT

YOU HAVE GOT IT ALL MIXED UP it is Russians that has got the mongolian /Fino Ugric DNA NOT Ukrainians as Ukrainians are the true Slavs ...

Take a look at how moscow leis about its history 
http://www.euromaidanpress.com/2014/05/14/how-moscow-hijacked-the-history-of-kyivan-rus/

Russians er nothing more then Mongolians that must have some funny sort of Down Syndrome or something as they think they are from Kiev Russ and Slavic background when the DNA study of today's so called Russians shows that the historical facts are thay they are Mongoloid / Finno-Ugric descendents and NOT Slavic...

The DNA evidence proves that Russians with out a doubt are Mongoloid / Finno-Ugric descendents ..Result Russians are NOT Slavic and have no real clam to Slavic historical lands

END OF STORY

THE R1a explanation for dummy's Russians have is R1a-Z93 and is the main Asian branch of R1a.

Western and Northern European and also western Ukrainians have R1a -Z284 falls under the root R1a1a1* (M417), So this proves Russians are Asian NOT Europeans..

The DNA evidence proves that Russians with out a doubt are Mongoloid / Finno-Ugric descendents ..

1. Russians are not Slavic.

2. Russians are Mongolians / Finno-Ugric

3. Russians are lying about where they come from and how they really are

4.The DNA study's and results er inn LOL

You can't change facts, what we call today Russians are Finno-Ugric Mongolian descendants Result Russians are NOT Slavic and have no real clam to Slavic historical lands END OF STORY

The Mongolian Y-DNA (paternal) haplogroup R1a-Z93 and is the main Asian branch of R1a. and its offshoots are very common and the dominant gen among Russian men.

Studies have found the ethnic Russian frequency of R1a high as 62.7 percent, with an average of 46.7% of Russians in the ""Russia-DNA Project"" include R1a1, R1a1a, R1a1a1g, and R1a1a1g2.

Russian alcoholism and the ""Mongoloid gene""

SCIENTISTS researching cures for alcoholism and hangovers say that they have found a genetic link between Russians’ traditional weakness for drink and the marauding Mongol armies.

in a test of Muscovites it was proven that they are infact descendants of mongolians / finish the Mongol genes are dominant genes in what we today call Russians..

Scientists foud out that the Mongolian genes make the Russians absorb more alcohol into the bloodstream and break it down at a slower rate than most Europeans.

That means that they get more drunk and have worse hangovers, and are more likely to become addicted to alcohol, given Russia’s taste for vodka, its harsh climate and the social and economic chaos after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

“The difference is huge — in reaction speed, memory, hand tremor — and in how they recover,” Vladimir Nuzhny, of the Health Ministry’s National Narcology Research Centre, said. “On average, 76 per cent of people in Moscow have this Mongoloid gene. So this, we think, is part of the problem.”

As part of the study, the scientists paid 12 volunteer students to drink 350 grams, about a third of a bottle, of vodka in an hour, and then monitored their behaviour.

“That’s a lot by Western standards, but it’s normal for Russia,” Dr Nuzhny told The Times. “At first they thought it was great, because they were being paid to drink, but after a while they realised it was more like work.”

The intoxicated students had to perform a series of tests, including answering questionnaires and playing rally-driving computer games, and they were breathalysed at regular intervals. The scientists even measured their ability to stand up straight.

After sleeping off the effects in a dormitory at the laboratory — which had a karaoke machine — the students were given a slap-up breakfast before doing more tests to measure their hangovers. The study showed that those with the Mongol genes absorbed 50 per cent more alcohol into the bloodstream at peak levels and metabolised it much more slowly than the other students.

“The way they get drunk is completely different than the way Europeans get drunk . They are also more likely to feel aggressive or depressed,” Dr Nuzhny said. “They do not necessarily look Mongolian, but the gene that governs how they metabolise alcohol is Mongoloid.”

The Mongols swept across Asia and Russia and into Europe in the 13th century and ruled Russia for two centuries. Inter-marriage with the ethnic Finnish tribes that was living around the northern part of the moscow river at the time was common.

Scientists have long known that people of Mongol extraction, including Japanese,Koreans and Northern Chinese, have an enzyme for metabolising alcohol that is different from that of Caucasian Europeans.

Dr Nuzhny claims that his study is the first to look at the effect of alcohol on

Russians today are descendents of mongolians and finnish people and the DNA test shows this fact... The Russians today have inherited their forefathers Mongol genes.

He says that the phenomenon can be explained partly by evolution. The nomadic Mongols, whose only indigenous form of alcohol was fermented mare’s milk, evolved with a different enzyme from the settled Europeans, with their long tradition of producing stronger grape and grain-based alcohol.

Dr Nuzhny’s research is partly funded by pharmaceutical companies trying to develop drugs to cure hangovers and alcoholism.

Russians drink about 15 litres of pure alcohol a head each year, one of the highest rates in the world, and by some estimates one in seven Russians are alcoholics. Alcohol is largely to blame for a fall in life expectancy to less than 59 since the fall of the Soviet Union.

588,"Article by: Vitaliy Portnikov
The proposal by French MP Thierry Mariani to impose sanctions against Ukraine for not implementing the Minsk-II agreements may appear at first glance as the eccentric antics of a Putin supporter who is using it to draw attention to the lifting of sanctions against Russia. But in reality it is the very logical result of an entire policy designed not so much to restore the primacy of international law and the territorial integrity of Ukraine as to appease the aggressor country and to look for ways to resume cooperation with it as fast as possible.

Mariani, this respectable fighter for racial purity who had attempted at one time to divide French citizens according to their skin color and ethnic origin, has now brought the situation to absurdity. Who is responsible for the fact that Ukraine is occupied, that our citizens are being killed and tortured, that we do not control a part of our  territory and borders? Why, Ukraine, of course! Who else! Ukraine should have surrendered to Putin, and then Mariani and the other collaborators could have traveled to Kyiv for meetings with the Putin-appointed leaders of Ukraine and could have described how much stability we have and how elegant the Russian tanks appear on Khreshchatyk (main street of Kyiv — Ed.). For them, this was not the first time!

In 1938, respectable  French politicians applied the “warmonger” label not to Chancellor Adolf Hitler but to the President of Czechoslovakia Edvard Beneš, who tried to resist the dismemberment of his country. Only two year after these accusations, the French Prime Minister Édouard Daladier, along with other politicians who had been outraged by  Benes, ended up in the collaborators’ prison and German tanks appeared on the Champs-Élysées. But I wouldn’t describe this sight as elegant, Monsieur Mariani and you other crooks now dancing for the Kremlin Fuhrer. I would call it shameful. And I want you and all the other citizens of the French Republic to remember this shame forever. And not to forget those Ukrainians who gave  their lives so that foreign tanks would never again appear on the Champs-Élysées. And so that those Ukrainians who are giving their lives to keep foreign tanks from Khreshchatyk are not forgotten either.

Let these people become the silent witnesses to each shameful initiative, each treacherous vote, Monsieur Mariani.",2016-06-05 10:34:21+00:00,d3wpbq1,1.0,t3_4mmued,43.0,russiawarinukraine

593,"To make his point, Konchalovsky provides a collection of devastating statistics that Russians seem all too ready to ignore. Among them are the following:

Mortality in Russia: “Over the last 20 years, more than seven million Russians have died off … Every year, Russia loses as many people as the population of a whole oblast the size of Pskov [over 673 thousand people in 2010 census – Ed.]… The number of suicides, murders and accidents in Russia is comparable with the level of mortality in Angola and Burundi … Life expectancy of Russian men is approximately 160th among the countries of the world, just ahead of Bangladesh.”

A Crisis in the Russian Family: “Eight of ten older Russians who live in homes for the elderly have relatives capable of supporting them … The country has from two to five million unsupervised children,” 100 times as many as China. “80 percent of the 370,000 children in orphanages having living parents … and we are first in the world in terms of the number of children abandoned by their parents.”

Crimes against Children: In 2010, 1700 of every 100,000 children were raped or killed, a figure that is higher than “even in South Africa” and one that means that “every day in Russia four or five children are murdered. In the same year, there were 9500 sex crimes against minors, a figure exceeded only in South Africa.

Drug Abuse and Alcoholism: 30,000 Russians die each year from overdoses of narcotics, and 70,000 from alcoholism directly. These figures compare with the loss of 14,000 Soviet soldiers in all the years of the Afghan war. Russians now consume 15 liters of pure alcohol annually, even though the WHO says that consuming 8 liters a year threatens the survival of the nation.

Corruption: Corruption is so massive and so widespread that it surpasses this plague in any other country. The misuse of the courts has become tragic: now Russian courts are even prepared to try the dead, something that happened in Europe the last time in the 17th century when Oliver Cromwell was dug up and tried.

Hollowing Out of the Country: “Over the last ten years, 11,000 villages and 290 cities in Siberia have disappeared,” opening the way for China and Japan whose population densities far exceed those of Russia east of the Urals. “For whom did we conquer and develop Siberia and the Kuriles? It turns out, it was for the Chinese or the Japanese,” Konchalovsky says.

Rising Poverty: Despite its enormous natural wealth, “it is shamefully the case” that half of the Russian population consists of poor people.

These are horrific figures, the writer says, and he is “certain that Putin knows all these facts,” which prompts the questions: What does he think about them? And what is he prepared to do? Especially at a time when Russia is “approaching a demographic and moral catastrophe which it has never experienced before.”

There are many explanations for Russia’s sad state and current division into two nations, Konchalovsky continues. “The chief among them is the irresponsible economic policy of the 1990s” when “people with a feudal consciousness who never knew private property in land or capitalism’ and who had lost the spirit of entrepreneurship under 70 years of communist rule.

But perhaps the most horrific explanation for what is wrong in Russia today, is that Russia’s oppressors have come not from abroad as was the case in Africa but “out of the ranks” of Russia’s own citizens, something that ultimately makes what has happened even sadder and more unforgivable.

If only a third of Russians were to recognize this and stand up behind it, he suggests, “RUSSIA WOULD BE A DIFFERENT COUNTRY.” But unfortunately that has not happened. For it to occur, Konchalovsky says, “Russia needs a leader who would have the courage of Peter the Great to tell people words which they have not heard for a long time.”

Those words would convey “a bitter truth,” one that Russians must hear if they are to have any hope of moving forward because at present, the vast majority of Russians “do not want to understand how far they lag behind Europe in their civilizational development.”",2016-06-02 11:47:54+00:00,d3syp87,1.0,t3_4m6qln,350.0,russiawarinukraine

Religion is a personal not a state issue besides being a fact that even Mohammed said Jews, Christians and Muslims are people of THE BOOK (not books) pointing to the same sources, present day religions all have common roots which date back NO more then 3000 years ago (900-700 BCE)

Responsibility for the content of the occupied territory of another State the responsibility of the occupier state (see. Articles 55, 56, 59 and 60 of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12.08.1949.).
International law is based on the reasonable principle that includes the occupied territories who occupied them.
And for the refusal of the content of the occupied territories, the commission in the area of ​​occupation of various crimes, carries the guidance of the occupant (Nos. Xxv para. 2 of Art. 8 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal), and personally Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is the initiator and organizer of this occupation.
If Putin does not fully fund the annexed Crimea, the appointment of the Hague International Criminal Tribunal for criminal sanctions Putin for the annexation of the Crimea and the war in the Donbass region, it will be taken into account as an aggravating circumstance.
In other words, the Russian Federation is obliged to have annexed the Crimea in full - in the annexed territory to supply all the resources necessary for the survival of the occupied population: water, food, medicine and so forth.
At the same time Ukraine should not worry about how it will make Russia. Ukraine should follow the execution of the above international standards in the literal sense.
And about that in the media need to convey this information to the population living on the occupied and unoccupied territories of Ukraine to ease social tensions among the people associated with the blockade annexed Crimea.
For people to understand the logic of the authorities to liberate the occupied territories and were able to advance orientation. In Crimea, home to a significant number of people who are ready for anything, even the most drastic measures possible, if only to Russia's occupation of the Crimea was gone forever.
In carrying out its constitutional duty to protect the territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities must effectively use the above existing international legal standards to Russian invaders to obstruct the illegal occupation of the Crimea.
Ideally, of course, we need to strive to create the occupants of the conditions under which the occupation of the Crimea by Russia would be impossible.
To this end, Ukrainian authorities need to adopt a law ""On additional measures for the protection of territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine"", aimed at the complete economic, energy and transport blockade annexed Crimea.
It is necessary to prohibit by law not only in the delivery of any goods annexed the Crimea, but also the entry of vehicles owned by legal entities. Any economic cooperation with the temporarily occupied territories should be completely banned.
At the same time, the above proposed law should be directed to support of Ukrainian citizens who intend to move from annexed the Crimea and other occupied territories in continental Ukraine.
Do you want to move from the annexed Crimea, withdraw your business, etc. ... without question. The state should assist.
But any economic cooperation with annexed the Crimea should be completely banned.
Complete economic blockade of Ukraine annexed the Crimea and Donbas occupied does not constitute a waiver of Ukraine on these territories.
No territorial acquisition or special advantage resulting from aggression is or shall be recognized as lawful (Art. 3 of Art. 5 Definition of Aggression, approved. Resolution 3314 (XXIX) of the General Assembly on 14.12.1974). This provision is based on the principle of Roman law: ""the misuse can not follow the law"".
The economic blockade of Ukraine annexed the Crimea and Donbas occupied, this international legal necessity to make Putin and his junta bear adequate payment for its aggression and at the same time the ability to punish them financially.
It is important to realize that the stronger the economic damage caused to the aggressor, the sooner the occupation is removed from Russia.
It's time to get Russia to abide by international law.
The aggressor is obliged to incur adequate payment for their aggression.",2016-05-30 12:48:30+00:00,d3p36lr,1.0,t3_4lpcn8,417.0,russiawarinukraine

 Empress Catherine II gave the Black Sea Cossack Host the rights to these lands. Her decree of 30.6. and 1.7.1792 handed these lands over to the Black Sea Cossacks ""for eternity"".

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea_Cossack_Host

The Cossacks founded the administrative centre of Yekaterinodar (literally ""Catherine's gift"") in 1794 (now Krasnodar,RF)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaporozhian_Cossacks

In 1784 Potemkin formed the Host of the Loyal Zaporozhians (Войско верных Запорожцев) and settled 
them between the Southern Bug and Dniester rivers. For their invaluable service during the Russo-Turkish War (1787–92), 
they were rewarded with the Kuban land and migrated there in 1792.

And like USA didn't want to let the SU fail, thats why they gave nukes of Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus to russia in exchange of a worthless Budapest Memorandum paper, so they won't let RF fail, USA NEEDS a enemy for EUrope to sell their weapons

Putin's wars changed my view, now I don't want neither USA or Russia in EF or NATO.
And NATO not fighting USA wars in Middle East, but throwing out Putin's mercanaries and soldiers out of his occupied areas and sanctions now at level 3 up to 8 of 10.

Even without USA NATO outnumbers Russia.

Russia and Putin have become lower life forms to the world, not just the West.

IS is like Al-Qaida just USA made (Gulfstates and SA founded it, friends of USA), Europe should deport terrorists and entire families back to where they came from.

Russia's intervention in Syria was just to raise oilprice (failed) and use refugees as migrationweapon to EU, which is largest economic bloc in the world.

If UN GA wants it all vetoright of P5 UNSC will be abolished, then neither USA, Russia or China can't behave as emperors anymore, those 3 and UK and France are responsible for all wars, refugees and deaths.

Putin will before next 10 years be on trial at Nuremberg, or better on Crimea HAHA

 Fourteen Defining 
Characteristics Of Fascism
By Dr. Lawrence Britt
Source Free Inquiry.co
5-28-3


Dr. Lawrence Britt has examined the fascist regimes of Hitler (Germany), Mussolini (Italy), Franco (Spain), Suharto (Indonesia) and several Latin American regimes. Britt found 14 defining characteristics common to each:
 
1. Powerful and Continuing Nationalism - Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.
 
2. Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights - Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of ""need."" The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.
 
3. Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause - The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.
 
4. Supremacy of the Military - Even when there are widespread
domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.
 
5. Rampant Sexism - The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Divorce, abortion and homosexuality are suppressed and the state is represented as the ultimate guardian of the family institution.
 
6. Controlled Mass Media - Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.
 
7. Obsession with National Security - Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.
 
8. Religion and Government are Intertwined - Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions.
 
9. Corporate Power is Protected - The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.
 
10. Labor Power is Suppressed - Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed.
 
11. Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts - Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked.
 
12. Obsession with Crime and Punishment - Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.
 
13. Rampant Cronyism and Corruption - Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.
 
14. Fraudulent Elections - Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.",2016-04-12 06:59:52+00:00,d1zjaia,8.0,t1_d1z18bk,31760.0,russiawarinukraine

Fourteen Defining Characteristics Of Fascism By Dr. Lawrence Britt Source Free Inquiry.co 5-28-3
Dr. Lawrence Britt has examined the fascist regimes of Hitler (Germany), Mussolini (Italy), Franco (Spain), Suharto (Indonesia) and several Latin American regimes. Britt found 14 defining characteristics common to each:
Powerful and Continuing Nationalism - Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.

Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights - Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of ""need."" The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.

Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause - The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.

Supremacy of the Military - Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.

Rampant Sexism - The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Divorce, abortion and homosexuality are suppressed and the state is represented as the ultimate guardian of the family institution.

Controlled Mass Media - Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.

Obsession with National Security - Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.

Religion and Government are Intertwined - Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions.

Corporate Power is Protected - The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.

Labor Power is Suppressed - Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed.

Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts - Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked.

Obsession with Crime and Punishment - Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.

Rampant Cronyism and Corruption - Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.

Fraudulent Elections - Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.

Daar kan je dus niet Oekraine, enkel rusland de schuld van geven.
De meeste Oekrains of Russich sprekenden die ik ken uit west- en oost-Oekraine zijn allemaal voor en zeker de russich sprekenden.

Ik doe ook mee met panel Maurice de Hond en heb sinds 2002 bij hem en andere panels aangegeven dat mijn vertrouwen in landelijke- en EU politiek ook voor mij op het ultieme dieptepunt zit.
Maar ook daar kan je Oekraine niet de schuld van geven, enkel de nederlandse stemmers (die thuisblijven) bij gemeentelijke, provinciale, landelijke of EU verkiezingen.
Ik ben dus ook VOOR herinvoering stemplicht zoals in Belgie.
Regelmatig kom ik in online discussies over diverse onderwerpen, en dan vraag ik terloops waar ze op gestemd hebben, en dan blijkt een toenemend aantal niet te stemmen.
Dan zeg ik ok discussie afgelopen als je niet eens van je wettelijk recht gebruikmaakt.
Veel zeggen dan, stemmen maakt niet uit, die ene stem.
Dan vertel ik ze (vertelde ik ook tegen PVDA lijsttrekker bij laatste verkiezingen alhier) in 1982 bij provinciale verkiezingen was er een plaatstelijke PVDA-er verkiesbaar, waar ik tijdens bijeenkomsten geregeld meningsverschillen mee had. Nu stemden wij thuis toen meestal op PVDA, maar ik brak met die traditie en stemde op een onbekende partij, de natuurwetpartij geloof ik, als proteststem tegen de gevestigde partijen en vooral PVDA.

Laat die man nu EEN stem tekort komen om als statenlid gekozen te worden. :-)
Bij de volgende bijeenkomst zag ik 'm weer en zei: Ging niet best geloof ik met je verkiezing? Nee, zei hij verbolgen, EEN stem tekort, als ik wist wie t was!!!!  Dus ik zei met een brede smile, dat was ik , ik heb ipv PVDA op natuurwetpartij gestemd...HAHA

Je snapt dat de verstandhouding tussen ons, niet echt verbeterd is, en ok was beetje gemeen misschien, maar je ziet zelfs 1 stem TELT :-)

Veertien kenmerken
Kenmerken van het fascisme
Door Dr. Lawrence Britt
5-28-3


Dr. Lawrence Britt heeft de fascistische regimes van Hitler (Duitsland), Mussolini (Italië), Franco (Spanje), Suharto (Indonesië) en diverse Latijns-Amerikaanse regimes onderzocht. Britt hebben 14 definities van de kenmerken gemeen met elkaar:
 
1. Krachtig en Voortzetting Nationalisme - fascistische regimes hebben de neiging om constant gebruik van patriottische motto's, slogans, symbolen, liederen en andere parafernalia te maken. Vlaggen worden overal te zien, net als de vlag symbolen op kleding en in de openbare displays.
 

2. Minachting voor de erkenning van de rechten van de mens - als gevolg van angst voor vijanden en de behoefte aan veiligheid, de mensen in fascistische regimes zijn ervan overtuigd dat de mensenrechten kunnen worden genegeerd in bepaalde gevallen als gevolg van ""nodig hebben."" De mensen hebben de neiging om de andere kant op te kijken of zelfs goedkeuren van folteringen, standrechtelijke executies, moorden, lange opsluitingen van gevangenen, enz.

 
3. Identificatie van Vijanden / Scapegoats als Unifying Oorzaak - De mensen zijn rally in een verenigend patriottische razernij over de noodzaak om een ​​vermeende gemeenschappelijke dreiging of vijand te elimineren: raciale, etnische of religieuze minderheden; liberalen; communisten; socialisten, terroristen, etc.

 
4. Supremacy van het Militair - Zelfs wanneer er wijdverbreide
binnenlandse problemen, is het leger krijgt een onevenredig groot deel van de financiering van de overheid, en de binnenlandse agenda wordt verwaarloosd. Soldaten en militaire dienst worden verheerlijkt.

 
5. Ongebreidelde Seksisme - De regeringen van de fascistische naties hebben de neiging om bijna uitsluitend door mannen gedomineerde te zijn. Onder fascistische regimes, zijn traditionele rolpatronen stijver gemaakt. Echtscheiding, abortus en homoseksualiteit worden onderdrukt en de staat wordt voorgesteld als de ultieme bewaker van het gezin instelling.

 
6. Gecontroleerde Massamedia - Soms media wordt rechtstreeks gecontroleerd door de overheid, maar in andere gevallen, wordt de media indirect gecontroleerd door de overheid regelgeving, of sympathiek media woordvoerders en leidinggevenden. Censuur, vooral in oorlogstijd, is heel gebruikelijk.

 
7. Obsession met National Security - Angst wordt gebruikt als een motiverend instrument van de overheid over de massa.

 
8. Religie en regeringsleiders elkaar verweven - Overheden in fascistische naties hebben de neiging om de meest voorkomende religie te gebruiken in de natie als een instrument om de publieke opinie te manipuleren. Religieuze retoriek en terminologie gemeen uit regeringsleiders, zelfs als de belangrijkste principes van de religie lijnrecht tegenover het beleid of de acties van de overheid.

 
9. De macht van het bedrijfsleven wordt beschermd - De industriële en zakelijke aristocratie van een fascistische natie vaak degenen zijn die de regeringsleiders aan de macht te zetten, het creëren van een wederzijds voordelige zakelijke / overheid relatie en machtselite.

 
10. arbeidskracht wordt onderdrukt - Omdat de organiserende kracht van de arbeid is de enige echte bedreiging voor een fascistische regering, zijn vakbonden ofwel volledig geëlimineerd, of zijn zwaar onderdrukt.

 
11. Minachting voor intellectuelen en de Kunsten - Fascistische naties hebben de neiging om te bevorderen en te tolereren openlijke vijandigheid tot het hoger onderwijs, en de academische wereld. Het is niet ongewoon voor hoogleraren en andere wetenschappers om te worden gecensureerd of zelfs gearresteerd. Vrijheid van meningsuiting in de kunsten en letters wordt openlijk aangevallen.

 
12. Obsession met Misdaad en straf - Onder fascistische regimes, de politie krijgen bijna onbeperkte macht om wetten af ​​te dwingen. De mensen zijn vaak bereid om de politie misbruiken over het hoofd en zelfs afzien van de burgerlijke vrijheden in naam van patriottisme. Er is vaak een nationale politie met vrijwel onbeperkte macht in fascistische naties.

 
13. Ongebreidelde Vriendjespolitiek en corruptie - fascistische regimes bijna altijd worden beheerst door groepen vrienden en medewerkers die elkaar aanwijzen van de overheid posities en gebruik regeringsmacht en gezag om hun vrienden te beschermen tegen aansprakelijkheid. Het is niet ongewoon in fascistische regimes voor nationale middelen en zelfs schatten te bestemmen, of zelfs ronduit gestolen door regeringsleiders.

 
14. Frauduleuze Verkiezingen - Soms verkiezingen in fascistische naties een complete schijnvertoning. Andere keren verkiezingen worden gemanipuleerd door lastercampagnes tegen of zelfs moord op kandidaten van de oppositie, het gebruik van wetgeving om de stemming nummers of politieke district grenzen, en manipulatie van de media te controleren. Fascistische naties ook typisch gebruik maken van hun rechterlijke macht te manipuleren of te controleren verkiezingen.

Het lijkt erop dat niemand echt opgevallen, maar de EU parlement heeft gestemd, dat de EU-lidstaten verdedigingswapens kan leveren aan Oekraïne. De term verdedigingswapen laat veel ruimte interpretatie. Volgens de VS voordat ze zelf de Tweede Wereldoorlog kwam de term verdedigingswapens toegestaan ​​levering van gevechtsvliegtuigen, onderzeeërs en vliegdekschepen naar het Verenigd Koninkrijk
Maar veel belangrijker laat ze exact dezelfde formule Amerika voor het Verenigd Koninkrijk op het moment. De resolutie luidt: ""Er zijn nu geen bezwaren zijn, met inbegrip van wettelijke beperkingen, voor de lidstaten om defensieve wapens te verstrekken aan Oekraïne, die zouden kunnen worden gebaseerd op een 'lenen-leaseregeling,"" Simpel gezegd Oekraïne kan de apparatuur lenen en moet het terug na de oorlog is voorbij. In theorie hebben ze alleen te betalen voor wat ze te verliezen. EU legers kunt gewoon het uit voorraad of zeggen order bewakingsapparatuur om hun eigen militaire installaties te beveiligen en leveren het voor nu naar Oekraïne om de grenzen te beschermen. Het grootste voordeel is dat het niet langer vereist dat de speciale budgetten die moeilijk te krijgen waren.

In wartimes you need a oligarch not a politician as leader, so Maidan is at pause.Battling corruption in Ukraine will take another 10 years, after war is done and that will take another 2 years.
Only mistake I've seen, not from Poroshenko himself btw, that after separatist withdrew from Sloviansk, volunteer/army could have blocked access to Donetsk, that way , ""separatist"" would now only hold part of Luhansk.

Best explanation is from Timothy Snyder, east-Europe historian at 59 min.

I know that West, EU-USA, hammer a lot on battling reform and anti-corruption, but what THEY do to help Ukraine except some sanctions that hurt Russia only by 25 billion?
If Russia fails with its war efforts, Ukraine only has to thank Saudi's for their oilprice-war, and their volunteerbatallions &amp; army (in that order) not the West.

Er woedt nu al meer dan een jaar een van de bloedigste oorlogen in Europa. Europese politici willen de ernst er niet van inzien, dus ondanks al het geweld verlegt het haar grenzen tot aan de Oekraïense frontlinies. Gewoon...

Politiek ballenknijpen en geweld is niet goed te praten, maar de frustratie is begrijpelijk
Het was weer ouderwets gezellig in de Rada (het Oekraïens parlement). Premier Arseniy Jatsenjoek werd (in het homofobe parlement) bij zijn ballen vastgepakt door een lid van Porosjenko’s partij, Oleg Barma. Gewoon omdat er nogal wat onvrede is over de...

Land van 2de kansen heeft haar kansen verspeeld
Joe Biden, de vice-president van Amerika (die andere grote bondgenoot van Oekraïne), was afgelopen week in Oekraïne. Niet om druk uit te oefenen op de Oekraïense maffiaregering zodat ze als de sodemieter Neerlands cultureel erfgoed moeten teruggeven, maar om diezelfde...

Het lijkt wel alsof Porosjenko tegen zijn volk zegt, 'Daar ligt Europa, ga!'
Dat Oekraïne een corrupt oligarchenlandje is behoeft geen uitleg. Waarschijnlijk wist u dat wel. Toch lonkt er ergens ook een lichtpuntje: de jonge generatie. Zij zijn de toekomst van het land die de corruptie en de economische hervormingen moeten gaan...

Onze Man in Oekrainistan. Porosjenko weet helemaal niets van democratie en denkt enkel aan zichzelf
Het was de week van de Oekraïense leugens, bedrog en propaganda. Dat terwijl de Oekraïense oligarch president Petro Porosjenko een bezoekje aan Nederland bracht. In het Nederland van liberale Europese normen en waarden mocht Porosjenko zelfs een lezing geven...

Terwijl Europa in de greep is van wat mohammedaanse gekkies die uit naam van Allah liberale, ruimdenkende, jonge mensen hebben afgeslacht in Parijs, gaat de terreur in het oosten van Oekraïne gewoon door. Geen IS daar, gewoon blanke, Slavische volken...

reply to article Ukraine Today comment:
American site? USA tried to save SU, like they now try to save Putin &amp; RF, that became clear to me when Obama said he wouldn't do a thing when Putin invaded Ukraine.. USA wants to keep a enemy for Europe, thats why the (r)usmedia say its Europe's responsibility to take care for the refugees of the USA -Russia wars in Middle East. March 8, 2014 I wrote in dutch media: this can be cubacrisis all over or bosnian war with 100.000 deaths... Obama choose for last, thank god Saudi oilwar drives Putin to exit, and there's NOTHING USA can do about it...it will still try, thats why the talks USA-Russia over Ukraine without Ukraine..see also the minimal help USA gave to Ukraine: NO javelins, crippled attackradar cause USA didn't want Ukraine to be able to look inside Russia, to counterattack shelling from Russia, see the humvees and other equipment gave and fell apart days after arriving in Ukraine...sanctions helped a bit (just 25 billion damage to Russian economy for both US-EU&amp;other sanctions) but Saudi oilwar did the trick, and Saudi said this morning they won't cut oil production...and Iran still has to come to market with its initial 0.5 mil barrels up to 3.5 mil barrels...HAHAHHAHAHA USA wanted a war in Europe, and thanks to Saudi Ukraine now has the upperhand......stuff it Obama..stuff it USA...DUMP TRUMP...Feel the Bern(ie Sanders)...USA gets what it deserves...the lid on the nose",2016-01-22 08:51:30+00:00,cz7l5vo,1.0,t3_41zuy4,71418.0,russiawarinukraine

USA wanted to save SU from falling, like they now try to save Rf from itself, but despite hardly any help from USA,  Ukraine holds now the upper hand, thanks to Saudi oilwar, THEY take no gas, oil, coal from russia, their export to russia is now towards EU and even larger, their imports from russia are half of before, and people boycot products from russia, even in russian speaking east of Ukraine.
Russia has just months left before it defeats itself, and one of their major problems, after their defeat, there will be no longer a russian Crimea, and even no russian base on Crimea if it comes under Ukraine again (perhaps as autonomous republic even).
And that worries USA, cause after fall of russia, and collapse of RF (see Tartarstan now..) russia/RF won't be a enemey anymore for EU(rope).
And that costs USA dearly in armssales.. and influence...in (EU)rope, perhaps EU or it growing descendant (european federation or even eurasionfederation)will decide to disslove NATO as it is, and form a EUTO, just for Europe, and leave Turkye out of it...
And then USA is no longer the most ""powerfull"" nation...as Obama said in his last STOUN.
The country with largest debt in the world, who relies on China to loan its payments for RENT on his debt, can hardly be called that...
Ofc USA will try, as ""democratic"" country, try to prevent Europe going its own way...
looking at that USA is as much a leech on rest of the world, as Muscovy is on RF now.

Russians could have prevented all this, if his father spoiled his seamen on the stove, and let its sis... after RF fails and falls , Ukraine should have no mercy with Muscovy...and all russians who claim to be victim of Putin and his propaganda..and say: wir haben das nicht gewusst... We heard that before..

Forum for Democracy, is pretty creepy, little just after 1945, three-piece suit, gin and thick cigars, world split between superpowers with or without 10/100 thousands of victims, their immigration weapon to destabilize Europe, Merkel is their figurehead as Fuhrer of the EU, driven by US ... whether it was Putin?

these links are good to show what is behind Forum for Democracy is however typical that they are so democratic that they even do not have a forum site, so would not know what people denken..oh yes people should think less

and even D66, which comes from JOVD ... https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democraten_66 https://www.jovd.nl/vereniging and for the stage they compete against each other, and thus increase their polls.
2015: In 2015 Baudet founded the so-called ""independent think tank"" Forum for democracy. In the Recommendation Committee of the Forum is composed of, among others, Theodore Dalrymple (pseudonym Anthony M. Daniels, a British physician and writer, son of a German mother and a Russian father, a communist businessman) and, yes, his teacher Roger Scruton https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Scruton https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Dalrymple
Forum for Democracy - team: http://www.forumvoordemocratie.nl/team/ Trainee Forum for Democracy Lars Benthin, party leader VU Student http://www.devrijestudent.nl/rotterdam/nieuws.html And how about Besides sponsorship of the Free Student by the Youth Organisation for Freedom and Democracy (JOVD, the youth organization of the VVD)? http://www.folia.nl/actueel/90210/jovd-betaalde-rekeningen-de-vrije-student
https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thierry_Baudet
2013 http://www.joop.nl/opinies/is-thierry-baudet-de-tweede-machiavelli
Baudet's law: We must be free to attack other countries, such as the invasion of Iraq, but neither the attacked country, nor our victims may drag us to court
Baudet's world This is Thierry Baudet's model of international law in his book 'The attack on the nation state "": the party can impose its will on others with the largest tanks. If it were up to Baudet, ECHR Chagossians should never hear, because he found it strange that Iraqis Britain could sue for human rights abuses in Iraq. This in the name of freedom, said Baudet. For, such a court is limited in its sovereignty. And who are these foreign judges to tell us what to do in our country? In fact, these judges come from foreign cultures such as Turkish, Polish, Bulgarian, Lithuanian, Russian and Romanian. They have a different concept of human rights and that we should have here. In Baudet's model states must have total freedom, as stated in the NATO treaty. If another NATO country is attacked, NATO countries may decide whether to come to the rescue and how many bullets they provide. Baudet may not interpret international treaties courts, because that is against state interests and the limited sovereignty; therefore interpret statements and decide whether they are bound by their own contracts. A strange model, because few could endure so exist.
The Dutch conservatives emphasize patriarchal spearheads. They are against homosexuality and gay marriage, against divorce, against sex before or outside marriage, against abortion, against working women and at nurseries. Instead, they aim at a revival of the old-fashioned family of breadwinner model, and even a renewed stigmatization of illegitimate children.
* So US, Russia is quite ukraine, ex-Soviet states to attack? Conversely, too? * So US, Russia for example, may all int. tolerate flouting?
In early 2013 called Baudet, along with Victor Brothers and Arno Wellens, supported by, among others Ewald Engelen, René Cuperus, Ad Verbrugge and also having the same teacher of him Paul Cliteur, for a referendum ""on the future of the Netherlands in the European Union"" .
Baudet in 2012 he received his PhD (on his 29th, a bit late, huh ;-)) on June 21, 2012 at the Law Faculty of the University of Leiden, where he led by Paul Cliteur and Roger Scruton (remember those two names SVP) to a thesis worked on national identity, European integration, and multiculturalism. https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Cliteur

2009 https://www.indymedia.nl/en/2009/05/59728.shtml Libertas European Independent Institute - split from Edmund Burke Foundation. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Independent_Institute It was founded by Sander Boon and Eline van den Broek, [1] former members of the Edmund Burke Foundation. The Institute Focuses on free markets, and is more libertarian than the conservative Edmund Burke Foundation.

When Russian behave as russians

Staying nuclear is the best guarantee of Ukraine's safety and independence-certainly much better than the squishy assurances that go with NATO's ""Partnership for Peace,"" which Clinton said Ukraine is welcome to join. In a crunch, the Russians would have no grounds to think the U.S. and its allies would shed blood to defend Ukraine. But the Russians can be quite sure that Ukraine would defend itself with nuclear weapons, if necessary.

Kiev's nuclear arsenal also works to the advantage of Eastern Europe. Ukraine, which has every interest in discouraging Russian aggression, would be the natural ally of all the other countries worried about Moscow's intentions-starting with the four that want to join NATO. A Poland standing alone would be vulnerable to Russian extortion, but not a Poland standing shoulder to shoulder with a nuclear Ukraine.



By trying to strip Ukraine of its great equalizer, Clinton is preventing the kind of new regional arrangements that are needed to foster peace and stability in the old East bloc. In their place, he offers the hope that NATO will expand eastward, though not until such time as it won't offend the Russians. He wants-sort of-to do for Eastern Europe what it could do for itself.

What he can't alter, though, is the plain fact that the biggest force in NATO, the U.S., has no vital interests in Eastern Europe and therefore can't be relied on to protect it. Ukraine, which has vital interests in Eastern Europe because it is part of Eastern Europe, can't afford to stand aside if Russia reverts to its old habits.

Clinton is basing his entire policy on the fond wish that Russia won't regress. But the administration is not so optimistic that it's ready to give up America's own nuclear arsenal.

Ukraine would be smart to take similar precautions rather than rely on the benevolence of Russia or the fortitude of the U.S. And the U.S. should stop trying to deprive Eastern Europe of its best insurance against a future that may not be as tranquil as we hope.

Clinton's trip may not have achieved anything else worthwhile, but it did provide blinding proof that his policy on European security is exactly backward.




On the one hand, he wants to start integrating Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic into NATO-a measure against Russian aggression that conspicuously lacks the military forces needed to make it believable. On the other, he would neutralize an exceptionally useful check on Russian imperialism-a nuclear-armed nation of 52 million, Ukraine, that sits astride the approaches to Europe. In truth, Eastern Europe would be far safer behind Ukraine's atomic arsenal than America's meager commitment.

Both of the administration's mistakes flow from the same source: an excessively sunnyview of our former enemy. If from now on we can expect Russia to be as peaceable as Switzerland, there's no risk in pledging to defend Poland, since we'll never have to back it up anyway. And Ukrainians can sleep soundly without nuclear weapons because they have nothing to fear from the Russians.

Their history of treating neighbors like galley slaves didn't begin with communism and probably didn't end with it. In that case, one of the first targets will be Ukraine, which was joined to Russia for three centuries and which many Russians continue to regard as rightfully theirs.

But what if the Russians eventually start behaving not like Swiss but like Russians?

Flashback: Senator Obama pushed bill that helped destroy more than 15,000 TONS of ammunition, 400,000 small arms and 1,000 anti-aircraft missiles in Ukraine

after he became a senator, touring surplus weapons stockpiles
Most of the small arms and ammunition were left over when Soviets withdrew from Eastern bloc nations, and later dumped in Ukraine 
The two senators secured U.S. funding to help destroy the weapons instead of leaving them intact
Ukraine exported more than 700,000 small arms in 2004-2007, including 101,000 each to Libya and the UK, and 260,000 to the U.S.
But most of the ammunition stockpiles – crucial for keeping a standing army battle-ready – were destroyed
Ukraine is in a staring match with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has designs on recapturing portions of the former Soviet nation


As a U.S. senator, Barack Obama won $48 million in federal funding to help Ukraine destroy thousands of tons of guns and ammunition – weapons which are now unavailable to the Ukrainian army as it faces down Russian President Vladimir Putin during his invasion of Crimea.
In August 2005, just seven months after his swearing-in, Obama traveled to Donetsk in Eastern Ukraine with then-Indiana Republican Senator Dick Lugar, touring a conventional weapons site.
The two met in Kiev with President Victor Yushchenko, making the case that an existing Cooperative Threat Reduction Program covering the destruction of nuclear weapons should be expanded to include artillery, small arms, anti-aircraft weapons, and conventional ammunition of all kinds.
After a stopover in London, the senators returned to Washington and declared that the U.S. should devote funds to speed up the destruction of more than 400,000 small arms, 1,000 anti-aircraft missiles, and more than 15,000 tons of ammunition.


Photographs from the trip show Obama inspecting a plant where Soviet-era artillery shells and shoulder-fired missiles were collecting dust, leftovers dumped in Ukraine after the USSR withdrew from Eastern bloc nations after the once-mighty communist nation fell apart.
The United Nations had already identified some 7 million small arms and light weapons, and 2 million tons of conventional ammunition, warehoused in more than 80 weapons depots spread across the country.
Many of the artillery shells shown in photographs from Donetsk, multiple weapons experts told MailOnline, would be the same types of ammunition required to repel advancing Russian divisions as they advanced to the west, had they not been destroyed.

John Kerry arrives to show support for fledgling Ukraine...
Two experts said the ammunition, particularly small-arms rounds, would have been useful to train Ukraine's armed forces and million-strong reserves.
'Vast stocks of conventional munitions and military supplies have accumulated in Ukraine,' Obama said in am August 30, 2005 statement from Donetsk. 'Some of this stockpile dates from World War I and II, yet most dates from Cold War buildup and the stocks left behind by Soviet withdrawals from East Germany, the Czech Republic, Hungry and Poland.'
'We need to eliminate these stockpiles for the safety of the Ukrainian people and people around world, by keeping them out of conflicts around the world.'
More than a year later, President George W. Bush signed into law a proposal authored by Obama and Lugar.

Russian infantry vehicles have met no significant resistance from Ukrainian armed forces as they move into the nation's sovereign territory
 
Obama became president in 2008, and now faces a crisis in the nation he once sought to disarm

Sen. Lugar lost his seat in 2012 after it emerged that he no longer lived in Indiana, the state he represented. Obama became president in 2008, and now faces a crisis in the nation he once sought to disarm
Obama said then that the existing Cooperative Threat Reduction Program 'has effectively disposed of thousands of weapons of mass destruction, but we must do far more to keep deadly conventional weapons like anti-aircraft missiles out of the hands of terrorists.'
Much of the Ukrainian small-arms supply was ultimately exported, not scrapped, by a Yushchenko regime that chose revenue from arms dealing over the cost of melting down metal.
In 2008 the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute reported that between 2004 and 2007, the Ukrainian Export Control Service told the UN that it sent 721,777 small arms and light weapons to 27 different countries. 
The United States was the top recipient, with more than 260,000 of those weapons, followed by the UK and Libya, which each imported more than 101,000.
That flood of weapons exports has continued, with annual export records showing hundreds of thousands of new exports each year, covering everything from pistols and carbine rifles to heavy machine guns and anti-tank weapons.


Russian President Vladimir Putin (C) sent troops into the Crimea, a Ukrainian peninsula populated by more than 1 million ethnic Russians, without meeting significant military resistance

Russian President Vladimir Putin (C) sent troops into the Crimea, a Ukrainian peninsula populated by more than 1 million ethnic Russians, without meeting significant military resistance
But while today's 130,000-strong standing Ukrainian military isn't short on AK-47s, Russian troops have met little to no large-scale resistance from armored divisions or heavy artillery as they steamrolled their way into Crimea.
Some of that was Ukraine's own doing – it sold 320 tanks to Pakistan in the 1990s, for instance – but Obama and Lugar accelerated the pace of the country's arms liquidation.
While the Ukrainian army seems to have been careful to avoid provoking an even larger conflict, it's impossible to know whether Putin would have behaved differently in the face of columns of heavy weapons that once belonged to the Soviet Union in whose KGB he held a high-ranking position.
Sky News video broadcast on Tuesday showed Russian troops firing automatic weapons over the heads of apparently unarmed Ukrainian Air Force personnel near a contested airfield in Crimea.

2013  http://www.joop.nl/opinies/is-thierry-baudet-de-tweede-machiavelli

Baudet's volkenrecht: Wij moeten vrij zijn om andere landen aan te vallen, zoals de inval in Irak, maar noch de aangevallen landen, noch onze slachtoffers mogen ons voor de rechter slepen

 Baudet's wereld
Dit is Thierry Baudet's model van volkenrecht in zijn boek 'De aanval op de natiestaat': diegene met de grootste tanks mag zijn wil aan anderen opleggen. Als het aan Baudet lag, zou EHRM Chagossianen nooit mogen horen, want hij vond het ook raar dat Irakezen Groot-Brittannië mochten aanklagen, voor mensenrechtenschendingen in Irak.
Dit in de naam van vrijheid, aldus Baudet. Want, zo’n hof beperkt een staat in zijn soevereiniteit. En wie zijn die buitenlandse rechters om ons te vertellen wat we in ons landje moeten doen? Sterker nog, die rechters komen uit vreemde culturen, zoals Turkse, Poolse, Bulgaarse, Litouwse, Russische en Roemeense. Die hebben een ander concept van mensenrechten en dat moeten we hier niet hebben.
In Baudet's model moeten staten totale vrijheid hebben, zoals in het NAVO-verdrag staat. Als een ander NAVO-land wordt aangevallen, mogen NAVO-landen zelf beslissen of ze te hulp schieten en hoeveel kogels ze geven. Van Baudet mogen internationale hoven verdragen niet interpreteren, want dat is tegen staatsbelangen en het beperkt de soevereiniteit; dus staten interpreteren en beslissen zelf of ze aan hun eigen contracten gebonden zijn. Een raar model, want weinig verdragen zouden zo kunnen bestaan.

Ook de Nederlandse conservatieven leggen de nadruk op patriarchale speerpunten. Ze zijn tegen homoseksualiteit en het homo-huwelijk, tegen echtscheiding, tegen sex voor of buiten het huwelijk, tegen abortus, tegen werkende vrouwen en tegen crèches. In plaats daarvan mikken ze op een revival van het ouderwetse gezin met kostwinnersmodel, en zelfs op een hernieuwde stigmatisering van buitenechtelijke kinderen.


 

*Dus VS,Rusland is vrij oekraine, ex-sovietstaten  aan te vallen?  Andersom ook?

Two soda giants, The Coca Cola Company and PepsiCo, have been criticized by users of social networks for redrawing the Ukrainian borders by adding Ukraine's Crimea to the map of Russia.

The unpleasant story started unfolding when an innocent New Year posting on Coca-Cola's official Russian-language page on Russia's popular social network VK was published on December 30 along with Russia's map, which did not originally depict Crimea, Kaliningrad oblast and the disputed Kuril Islands.

After a large number of Russian users criticized the image, the company published a new map with Crimea being part of Russia's territory in the early hours of January 5 and apologized to Russians for the mistake.

1260,"In Russian, ""Укроп"" (ukrop) means dill (as in the herb). It became a derogatory slang term in the war-torn eastern Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts of Ukraine used by separatists to indicate Ukrainian soldiers and volunteer fighters. Ukrainians took ownership of the term as a patriotic label and soon not only the name, but the image of dill weed, became a popular part of the Ukrainian fight to maintain the integrity of their borders.

A Ukrainian rock group Haydamaky wrote a song ""Ukrop"" that has become a hugely popular success. As the Ukrainian folk instrument, bandura, has been called ""the voice of Ukraine,"" is it only fitting that talented individuals of the Bandura at Bobriwka workshop arranged this song to be played on bandura so our kids could play it in honor of the fight for freedom happening now in Ukraine. The rock video can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwh6WGGGFzw

The song sings of children, parents, and the elderly amidst war-torn surroundings hoping for peace with incredible dedication and resilience. The chorus to this song can be translated as:

You are Ukrop, I am Ukrop,
Ukraine is the land of Ukrops.
Ukrops are strewn across the field

1264,"In creating their nation, Ukrainians need to examine and analyze their own history, based on truth, verified facts and historical events. For centuries under the rule of conquerors, Ukrainians were basically deprived of the opportunity to influence the formation of national awareness and the development of their history, with the result that Ukraine’s history was composed predominantly to the advantage of their conquerors. Especially troublesome is the question of the pretensions and demands of Moscow, and later Russia, concerning the historical legacy of Kyivan Rus.

In his historical work “The Land of Moksel or Moskovia” (Olena Teliha Publishing House, Kyiv 2008, 2009, 3 vol.) V. Bilinsky presents historical sources (predominantly Russian) which testify to the total misrepresentation of the history of the Russian Empire, which was geared to create a historical mythology about Moscow and Kyivan Rus sharing common common historical roots, and that Moscow possesses “succession rights” to Kyivan Rus.

Moscow’s outright fraud that appropriated the past of the Great Kyiv kingdom and its people dealt a severe blow to the Ukrainian ethos. Our obligation now is to utilize hard facts to uncover the lies and amorality of Moskovian mythology.

Most Ukrainians celebrate their Orthodox Christmas on January 7, with lots of Christian traditions, but also rituals and traditions of their pageant roots, that go back thousands of years. Some of these traditions have survived wars and Genocide. The Holy Supper began with the first star that is seen in the evening sky usually by the children, symbolizing the star of Bethlehem and the 3 wise men. The head of the household starts the meal with the first spoonful of ""Kutya"" which is wheat with honey, and ground poppy seeds (ancient origion), and says ""Khrystos Rodyvsya meaning (Christ is born), which everybody replies in unison ""Slavic yoho"" (Let us praise him). The eating of the Kutya symbolizing the spiritual unity of all living and decreased relative and ancestors. Everything has symbols and meaning ~ The 12 or 13 course meal (all vegetarian) representing the 12 apostles, and Christ. The stalk of golden wheat on the table or in the corner of the room, meaning The Staff of Life, also symbolizing the family ancestors. There are also other things with symbolism and meaning. Christmas caroling is sung on Christmas eve, and Christmas day. Most songs deal with the birth of Christ, but also have songs and mythological elements that go back to thir pageant roots, more like Folk Opera... One of their favorite songs, a folk chant called ""Shchedryk"" has become American Christmas classic call CAROL OF THE BELLS!!! ~ Traditional day for presents for the kids come on December 19 from ""Svyatyi Mykolai""(Saint Nicholas) and a gift New year day by Father Fost. Traditional Orthodox Christmas is for the celebration of the birth of the Savior and family..

1308,"when USSR collapsed it halved, so the ex-sovietstates incl. Ukraine would have had more rights to that, since Ukraine was one of founding members of USSR.

But like i've just put on my reddit: USA did everything to keep USSR/Soviet Union UP, it made them billions in money of armssales to Europe countries cause of USSR treat.
After Berlin Wall fell, in dutch/europe media there were angry stories: well USA, wtf where are those massive tankbattilions stationed in DDR? Did we buy arms to battle those 1000's of falling apart DDR tankyards??

In that light, the Budapest Memorandum and removal of nukes of Ukraine, Belarus and Kazahstan, and massive numbers of smaller arms in Ukraine by Clinton and senator Obama, looks creepy.
Also the denial of invasion by Obama in 2014, and the silence from White House.
And what was the first response when the USA came to the table of Europe, Baltics? You should (have) buy more arms...

March 8,2014 when I changed the title of topic in my dutch blog of Conflict in Ukraine to War Russia against Ukraine I wrote: it can be Cuba crises 1962, or Bosnia War 1990's with 100.000 deaths.

And Obama kept silent and later said he wouldn't intervene(object?) on the ""incursion"".....

If Obama would have said : WTF, Putin get the fuck out of Ukraine or else..Putin would have backed down.
If Europe part NATO wouldn't have been held back by USA, would have said we send 20.000 peacekeepers to Ukraine, on question of interim goverment, Putin would have backed down.

No, on order Obama and ""request"" Iraq president EU-nato forces were sent to Iraq/Syria??

That's why even without Budapest Memorandum, USA is as quilty as Russia on deaths.

It seems that a new home for cybercrooks has established itself at ‘.su’, the country-code top-level domain
(ccTLD) of the former Soviet Union. The ‘.su’ TLD, which was assigned in 1990 and endured in spite of the
dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, has seen an explosion of growth in recent years due largely, it
seems, to the patronage of hackers, spammers and other assorted online fraudsters. The administrators of
the ‘.su’ registry have acknowledged the problem publicly and have vowed to tackle it by rolling out a new,
stricter policy later this year.  
The ‘.su’ TLD was retained after the collapse of the Soviet Union for ‘patriotic’ reasons; it plays home to
websites such as ‘www.stalin.su’, dedicated to the memory of Stalin. It is one of the 19 ccTLD extensions
that Google currently treats as generic TLDs and, in this respect, sits alongside an odd selection of
geographical bedfellows such as ‘.tk’ (Tokelau), ‘.tv’ (Tuvalu) and ‘.la’ (Laos). The TLD is administered by the
Moscow-based non-profit Foundation for Internet Development on the basis of a memorandum of
understanding with RIPN, the registry for ‘.ru’, the ccTLD extension for Russia. In 2007 the price for
registrations was cut in order to make them more accessible. At around the same time, there were
discussions on whether to do away with the ‘.su’ TLD, but this only seemed to result in an explosion in its
popularity with a 600% increase in registrations (taking the total number to 80,000) in 2008.
Group-IB, which describes itself as a ""global cyber security company"" and runs one of Russia's two official
internet watchdogs, recently stated that the number of malicious websites hosted across the ‘.su’ TLD
doubled in 2011, and then doubled again in 2012. It seems that much of this growth was fuelled by the
migration of scammers from ‘.ru’, after the registry tightened up its rules in November 2011, allowing it to
terminate registrations found to be associated with malicious conduct pursuant to a complaint from a
""competent"" organisation.
Roman Huessy, who runs the security blog ‘www.abuse.ch’, maintains that ‘.su’ is home to ""a series of
sites actively working in the online equivalent of broad daylight, ransacking bank accounts and holding hard
drives hostage in return for ransom"" and that the hackers that control these so-called botnets ""can operate
with impunity for months at a time"".
The most well-known incident involving a ‘.su’ domain name occurred when the credit records and, in some
cases, Social Security numbers of celebrities and public figures such as Michelle Obama, Beyoncé, Donald 
Trump and Paris Hilton were posted on the website ‘www.exposed.su’ earlier in 2013. This prompted an
investigation by the FBI and, although the website now appears to have been shut down, the domain name
registration behind it still appears to be operational.
Sergei Ovcharenko of the Foundation for Internet Development acknowledges that the TLD has a problem
with cybercriminality, saying that ""we realise it's a threat for our image"", but he put it down to weak Russian
legislation and outdated terms of service. In order to address the latter of these two issues, Ovcharenko has
stated a new policy for the ‘.su’ TLD with tougher rules is due to be rolled out this summer. It will be
interesting to see whether this new policy will have the necessa",2015-12-22 10:57:03+00:00,cy7njsc,1.0,t3_3xtlgq,535.0,russiawarinukraine

In fact, last month .su hosted over 100 000 different registered domain names for the first time.  .su is listed as ‘being phased out’on the IANA website, but don’t expect this to occur anytime soon; the Russian Institute for Public Networks (to which .su is assigned) is still actively soliciting domain registrations.  That’s probably not good news for your computer, as many .su sites are havens for malware.  There are plenty of legitimate sites within .su as well, ranging from everyday businesses to post-communist nostalgia sites (not to mention Nashi, the pro-Putin nationalist youth movement).

So also in Middle East, in 1917 France and United Kingdom and Russia under secret Sykes/Picot Agreement divided Middle East into ""protecterates"", and esp.

1336,"Fourteen Defining 
Characteristics Of Fascism
By Dr. Lawrence Britt
Source Free Inquiry.co
5-28-3


Dr. Lawrence Britt has examined the fascist regimes of Hitler (Germany), Mussolini (Italy), Franco (Spain), Suharto (Indonesia) and several Latin American regimes. Britt found 14 defining characteristics common to each:
 
1. Powerful and Continuing Nationalism - Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.
 
2. Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights - Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of ""need."" The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.
 
3. Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause - The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.
 
4. Supremacy of the Military - Even when there are widespread
domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.
 
5. Rampant Sexism - The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Divorce, abortion and homosexuality are suppressed and the state is represented as the ultimate guardian of the family institution.
 
6. Controlled Mass Media - Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.
 
7. Obsession with National Security - Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.
 
8. Religion and Government are Intertwined - Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions.
 
9. Corporate Power is Protected - The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.
 
10. Labor Power is Suppressed - Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed.
 
11. Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts - Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked.
 
12. Obsession with Crime and Punishment - Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.
 
13. Rampant Cronyism and Corruption - Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.
 
14. Fraudulent Elections - Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.

And his grip on EU(Merkel) and NATO made sure it didn't get solved as Timothy Snyder, east-Europe historian said: he said if EU-NATO part was independent of USA, they could have sent 20.000 peacekeepers and Putin would have backed down.

USA and Merkel is as guilty in this as Putin, look what USA gave as help sofar a few 100 million, a load of defensive equipment, second hand and falling apart.
USA was the one that didn't want Soviet Union to fall, it made them billions in weaponsales to EU-NATO part, they tricked Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan to not destroy their nukes, but GIVE them to RF !???

In 1569 the ""Russian Empire"" did NOT exist - it was Muscovy [Moskali and Muscovites] before and after 1569.

In fact Latin, Greek, and Ruthenian [AKA - Ukrainian] were the languages used on European documents in 1581.

In 1581 Antonio Posevino, papal legate and member of the Order of Jesuits, paid an official visit to Moscow: 
We also saw that, by tradition, Muscovy is extremely dependent in religious matters on Rus’ [AKA - Ukraine] , which is currently ruled by the Polish king: very recently the Kyivan [AKA - Ukrainian] metropolitan of the Ruthenian [AKA- Ukrainian] faith ordained some Muscovite bishops.

“In Muscovy a person who has memorized the Slavic letters is considered an extremely learned person. Very few people know the Lord’s Prayer, and almost no one knows the Symbol of Faith, the Ten Commandments, and the Holy Virgin............

PS

Canards have been the ""SYSTEMIC"" policy, procedure, and practice of the kremlin [AKA - Muscovy] – for centuries.
Although the statement made by Metropolitan Kirill sounds quite credible and theologically articulated, it contains a controversial ecclesiological ambiguity. For Metropolitan Kirill all the historical facts of Rus‘, obviously, do not have any substantial ecclesiological or historical value. The historical local Church, as it was initially founded in Kievan Rus’- Ukraine by the Patriarchate of Constantinople and rightly recognized by Metropolitan Kirill as Local- “mysteriously transformed itself”, in words, the of Metropolitan Kirill, into the local Church of the Moscow Patriarchate. In the centuries from 988 to1686- the beginning of the occupation of the Orthodox Church in Ukraine by the Russian Orthodox Church, the Metropolis of Kiev prospered as a local Church under the Ecumenical Patriarchate. We have to remember, that it was the Metropolis of Kiev, not Moscow, that was placed by Emperor Leo the Wise, in the constitutional record of metropolis, archbishoprics and bishoprics “to the Patriarch of Constantinople”, on the 61st position (57). This document, dating from the 11th century, categorically defines the Metropolis of Kiev as a separate ecclesial entity, that in no possible way can it be identified with the Moscow Patriarchate, which at this time was not even on the map of Europe.
This fact that the local Church of the Metropolis of Kiev was independent was so strong in the mind of the ecclesial life of the fifteenth century that even the autocephaly of the Metropolis of Moscow was defined in terms of separation from the Metropolis of Kiev (58). Even the “Golden Seal Certificate” of the Ecumenical Patriarch Jeremiah II in the year 1591, validating the establishment of the Moscow Patriarchate, defined the canonical territory of the Russian Orthodox Church as the Church of Russia and the far northern parts within the Russian dominion, excluding the metropolis of Kiev and Lesser Rus’ (59):

“the throne of the most venerable and Orthodox city of Moscow is and shall be called Patriarchate’ .. and all Russia and the Far-Northern Territories shall be subject to the Patriarchal Throne of Moscow and all Russia. This has its place after His Beatitude of Jerusalem in the sacred diptychs, it is the head of this region of Moscow and all Russia and the Far-Northern territories” (60).

In fact it's not that strange in 2007:
Khudayr Taher said  Europe and America Should Deport All Muslims – Including Myself

Khudayr Taher, an Iraqi Shi’ite writer living in the U.S. and a regular contributor to the liberal Elaph website, had a quite illiberal suggestion – he asked why Europe and America shouldn’t deport their Muslim populations. He wrote:

“Countries have the right to defend themselves and assure their citizens’ safety from terrorism. Likewise, it is clear that the source of the terrorist crimes in Europe and America is the Muslims who live in these countries.

“The security services cannot know people’s intentions and sort out who is the noble immigrant and who is a terrorist criminal. [But] wherever there are Muslims, their presence has produced crimes of terrorism and murder.

“Among those Muslims in Europe and America who do not practice terrorism, most of them do not have loyalty and sincere attachment to these countries that have offered them all of the means of life in dignity – housing, studies, work, and citizenship…

“The legitimate question is this: Since the security services cannot sort out the good immigrant from the bad terrorist… why don’t these countries deport all Muslims, of all races, from Europe and America, and [thus] find rest from the danger of terrorism, and protect their peoples?

“I, as an Arab Muslim immigrant, sincerely call on the countries of Europe and America to deport all Muslims from their territories – including myself, despite my love and 
my sincere attachment to the U.S…”


All attacks in USA and Europe or elsewhere that Security Services can't prevent any attacks of terrorists, Muslim or otherwise..
only common people can, like was shown on Thalys..

Can't goverments then take NO preventive action? Ofc they can... In other then islamic countries you hardly see any public apperance of religious symbols, so if those countries ban public showing of religious symbols and clothing like burquas, islamphobia  will dissapear.

In latest shooting in USA we hear from family that the couple was radicalizing for years, so why didn't THEY adress that?

So the best preventive measure would be, not deporting all muslims, but making the entire family of terrorist accountable, muslim or otherwise, loosing citizenship/pasport and wealth, and be deported to country of origin.

In a community all are accountable, and should adress people who get out of order, thats called social control.

Hypocrism all around the world, that create the wars and refugees around the world the last 100 years since Sykes/Picot Agreement and Treaty of Sevres and all were caused in one way or another by current 5 permanent members of UN Security Council with vetorights or one or more of its allies. So also in Middle East, in 1917 France and United Kingdom and Russia under secret Sykes/Picot Agreement divided Middle East into ""protecterates"", and esp. UK made Israel possible on Palestine territority.

Now with Saudi Arabia(motherland of IS) , Gulfstates goverments started oilprice-marketshare-war going horribly wrong for themselves, and expected all oilproducing countries to go into bankruptcy from 2020 on, and turnmoil growing cause they can't supply their own citizens, a solution is needed, and quick and the answer is: its simple...

Remove by UNGA art. 377 all vetorights of all permanent members of UNSC, USA,Russia, China, United Kingdom and France so all members of UNSC can vote by majority and in effect all 193 members of UN can decide together instead just those 5 who have brought the world last 100 years to pieces for financial gain.

Besides disasterous Gulfwars and other conflicts brought upon Middle East, I just have to remind of Prescot Bush, granddad
of GW Bush, who financed Hitler throughout entire WOII, and made Ribbentrop-Molotov pact with Russia possible, which let Stalin start with Hitler WOII.

Thats why apart from sunni Kurds most SUNNI ISLAMIC countries (and people) support  IS.
Obama does his best to disassociate Daesh-IS from Islam, but in fact its a SUNNI- Shia ISLAMIC battle in Middle East..

ISIS is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isis
mother of Horus (Horuscope instead of Horoscoop) the sungod, base of many religions incl. Christianity..
https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLarj2-qKoqrjd6KbrAEVBNJhV2PCkpzN5&amp;time_continue=2&amp;v=TmC1X-R4aEk

There are many names used incl. ISL, but since Saudi Arabia  and Gulfstates all SUNNI founded and funded IS, that name is most appropiate.

Yes it has to do with religion, and what about the silent, peacefull majority of (sunni) muslims?
It's irrelevant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry3NzkAOo3s

Political correctness should indeed be put in trashcan and we should call it what it is.
Most muslims that are attacked by IS are Shia muslims.
President Assad of Syria, indeed a massmurderer, is Alawite thats a Shia sect.
In Yemen Houthi's who formed a alliance with president Shia, are Shia.
This morning Shia muslims were attacked in Nigeria by IS affiliated terrorists.

And interference in Middle East by first USA with Gulfwars and now Russia in Syria made matters worse.
Turkey is SUNNI, so is Libya which turned the immigration weapon on Europe, and Obama somehow let Merkel give her open invitation which now is turned back rapidly.
Cause USA want to sell weapons to Saudi Arabia (despite them having a decifit in 2016 and getting broke in 2020 due to their own actions on oilmarket &amp; oilprice, which turned out to be not working) and if you see IS they use USAmade weapons, possibly from Iraq and or Saudi Arabia.

So USA pretends to be fighting IS, while supporting its supporters :-)

Thats why I advocate  all vetorights of USA,Russia, China (and France &amp; UK) in UNSC should become invalid,
so a full UN(SC) by majority can repair what esp. the big 3 in UNSC have bene doing since 1945.

But why does USA SUPPORTS THEM, and saying its fighting Daesh-IS, we know they hardly do...!?
Why does USA supports the war between majority of sunni Muslims against minority of Shia muslims!?

sunni Turkey doesn't fight sunni daesh/IS they fight sunni Kurds and Shia Assad, Russia doesn't fight sunni daesh/IS but fights sunni Kurds and sunni Turkmen(allies Turkey) , USA doesn't fight Daesh/IS too much just 8 flight a day instead of 80 Gulfwar, cause friends of USA Saudi and Gulfstates support Daesh/IS. Shia Iran doesn't fight sunni daesh/IS too much, cause they don't wanna upset USA too much, they can in january flood oilmarket with 1/3 of oil more then now total,but more sunni Turkmen and sunni Kurds. Only ones really fightting sunni daesh/IS is at moment the sunni Kurds...  USA already said no lifting sanction or lookaway on Ukraine for russia.
 Turkeye says it just protects it borders, they didn't in mediterannee side cause refugeeflood and Russia made that a tsunami. Turkeye tries to lure NATO to fight his wars, like he lured Merkel into concessions..

The logic is simple and ruthless: radicalize the opposition so that the Syrian dictator looks like a lesser evil to domestic and foreign audiences. Here, Assad benefits from the inherently polarizing nature of civil war, as a cycle of atrocities and revenge pushes all sides to the extreme. He has further spurred radicalization by focusing the regime’s fire on moderate enemies, while reportedly releasing jihadists from jail and purchasing oil from ISIS. In recent months, the Syrian military allegedly used air strikes to help ISIS advance toward the city of Aleppo. Khaled Khoja, a Syrian opposition leader, claimed that Assad’s fighter jets were acting as “an air force for ISIS.”",2015-11-24 13:17:55+00:00,cxbbwap,1.0,t3_3u2p9i,59.0,russiawarinukraine

1514,"80% of refugeetsunami after russias intervention in Syria is MALES of the fighting age 20-35.
Why should Americans, French fighting IS in Syria, Iraq here while hundreds of thousands of Syrian men in fighting age 20-35 come to Europe and complain about shelterconditions?
And possibly among them are as we know now IS fighters.
In WWII the people who fled from EU to UK did not lie on the beach but volunteered to fight the NAZI's.
Women and children and elderly people can be regarded as refugees, men of fighting age NOT, they should be sent back, that saves 80% of the tsunami and also prevent male IS-fighters coming to Europe.
SO MALE refugees of fighting age? Refuse them as refugee and send them back.

Immigration isn't solving the world's  problems

Not all muslims are terrorists but most terrorists are muslim!
French police says they have in Paris alone 50.000 suspects, and to have a 24/7 surveliance they need 30 man for each suspect. In fact they say its impossible, the raids now are in places security services already knew.
simple solution: every (wannabe) terrorist, Islamic or otherwise, make it clear to them that the repurcusies are: family until last great-grandniece when applicable loose extra nationality from EU country(ies)(eg, Dutch nationality) and is extradited to the country of origin, entire fortune family is consfiquated. Especially among Arabs is ""honor"" big, so in honor killing is usually designated to a young cousin and then gets respect from family ... but THIS WAY  that respect-martyrdom is zero and he is responsible for total (financial) loss of family. Always fight with  same weapons, then wannbe's will be held back by family or they  ""deal"" with wannebe.

 EU(rope) is not responsible for the refugee (immigrants), only responsible are the warmongering parties in ME :USA &amp; Russia and Arab states behind IS. Merkel falls in trap Erdogan Turkeye, who didn't guard its borders (land, mediterannee) and thus caused the flood, and gets rewarded for not guarding its borders, with billions, visafree travel for 80 million Turks (and refugees) and possible EU membership? Several months ago when Russia started to help Assad, that created the refugee-tsunami. The cure for the sick EU (parlement-Brussel/Straatsburg) is not more EU, but far less..or a EF, european federation without europarlement and Brussels/Straatsburg. Own parliments and ministers rule together on a 1 country, 1 vote rule...

He's  wrong about putin,assad, turkeye should have eu on their side, turkeye and assad/russia  made the refugee flood and merkel made it a tsunami ,

Many mainstream Muslim organizations have gone so far as to say the Islamic State is, in fact, un-Islamic. It is, of course, reassuring to know that the vast majority of Muslims have zero interest in replacing Hollywood movies with public executions as evening entertainment. But Muslims who call the Islamic State un-Islamic are typically, as the Princeton scholar Bernard Haykel, the leading expert on the group’s theology, told me, “embarrassed and politically correct, with a cotton-candy view of their own religion” that neglects “what their religion has historically and legally required.” Many denials of the Islamic State’s religious nature, he said, are rooted in an “interfaith-Christian-nonsense tradition.”",2015-11-17 23:39:46+00:00,cx3wjmw,1.0,t3_3t844d,27.0,russiawarinukraine

1553,"recent investigation conducted by Novaya Gazeta, one of the few independent newspapers left in Russia, complicates this cozy tale of counterterrorist cooperation. Based on extensive fieldwork in one village in the North Caucasus, reporter Elena Milashina has concluded that the “Russian special services have controlled” the flow of jihadists into Syria, where they have lately joined up not only with ISIS but other radical Islamist factions. In other words, Russian officials are adding to the ranks of terrorists which the Russian government has deemed a collective threat to the security and longevity of its dictatorial ally on the Mediterranean, Bashar al-Assad.
It may sound paradoxical—helping the enemy of your friend—but the logic is actually straightforward: Better the terrorists go abroad and fight in Syria than blow things up in Russia. Penetrating and co-opting terrorism also has a long, well-attested history in the annals of Chekist tradecraft.
Milashina makes her case study the village of Novosasitili in Dagestan’s Khasavyurt district. Since 2011, nearly 1 percent of the total population of Novosasitili has gone to Syria—22 out of 2,500 residents. Of that figure, five were killed and five have returned home. But they didn’t leave Russia, a country notoriously difficult to enter and exit, without outside help. The FSB established a “green corridor” to allow them to migrate first to Turkey, and then to Syria. (Russians, including those living in the North Caucasus, can catch any of the daily non-stop flights to Istanbul and visit Turkey without a visa.)",2015-11-15 17:25:18+00:00,cx120d9,1.0,t3_3swxb1,35.0,russiawarinukraine

simple solution: every (wannabe) terrorist, Islamic or otherwise, make it clear to them that the repurcusies for terrorism are: family until last great-grandniece, when applicable loose extra nationality from EU country(ies)(eg, Dutch nationality) and is extradited to the country of origin, entire fortune family is consfiquated. Especially among Arabs is ""honor"" big, so in honor killing is usually designated to a young cousin and then gets respect from family ... but THIS WAY that respect-martyrdom is zero and he is responsible for total (financial) loss of family. Always fight with same weapons, then wannbe's will be held back by family or they ""deal"" with wannebe.

Most terrorists are homegrown, so just saying we bomb them doesn't help a bit, in France police said they have at least 50.000 suspects for terrorism in Paris alone, but can't keep them under survelliance ALL.

In Netherlands radical muslims approach refugees in shelters now.

So change control of them by govt. towards family, social control as we call that in NL.

And costs far less....

from http://uatoday.tv/society/ukrainian-military-expert-on-possible-reasons-for-paris-attacks-534060.html

besides that

80% of refugeetsunami after russias intervention in Syria is MALES of the fighting age 20-35.
Why should Americans, French fighting IS in Syria, Iraq here while hundreds of thousands of Syrian men in fighting age 20-35 come to Europe and complain about shelterconditions?
And possibly among them are as we know now IS fighters.

In WWII the people who fled from EU to UK did not lie on the beach but volunteered to fight the NAZI's.
Women and children and elderly people can be regarded as refugees, men of fighting age NOT, they should be sent back, that saves 80% of the tsunami and also prevent male IS-fighters coming to Europe.

SO MALE refugees of fighting age? Refuse them as refugee and send them back, reduces refugeetsunami and risk of terrorist attacks, most are male.

Most interesting theory I've heard from russians themselves (not from petersburg), was that bomb was planted by Putin's FSB and was supposed to be ignited above Ukraine, so Putin could redo MH17 scenario blamegame once more...but the plane didn't leave on time or was just crappy russian shit (another plane come down also in South Africa somewhere)

 EU hypocrisy or UNSC permanent members USA,Russia and China espec. and Muslim countries hypocrisy?

When I see this article or see CNN or other USA media and hear them say: it's EU(rope)'s responsibility to take in (Syrian) refugees from Middle East, I just have ONE question: WHY, did we start the wars in Middle East? Answer is simple: NO, we EU(rope) didn't start the wars in Middle East, so why should EU(rope) bear the burden of  refugees/immigrants with a total different culture, and which can be  millions in number ?

Turkeye , sees Syrian Assad as enemy, from the start didn't guard its borders with EU, on land and coastal regions, like it should under int. law, in the hope to gain from it towards EU(rope), and Merkel was succesfuly trapped like we hear in the news.Turkeye is solely responsible for all smuggling and drowings of refugees/illegal immigrants.

As I wrote in Dutch, EU can agree with demands Turkeye, only after Turkeye agrees to bring back the old Kurdistan.
Turkeye uses the Kurds to fight for them, and if they get to succesfull Turkeye shoots them in the back.

The immigrant/refugee flood or better said tsunami started when some months ago Russia started helping shiite Assad of Syria, a dictator who already killed 240.000+ of its own people.
What's in it for Russia, its port in Syria and preventing Qatar, other Gulfstates and Saudi-Arabia(which is broke in 5 years), the founding forces behind sunni IS(IS/Daesh, to lay a gaspipeline thru Syria, Turkeye to Europe, the biggest economic bloc in the world (wiki)
Shiite Iran is also helping shiite Assad, and is in fact a competitor for Russia, when it can throw its oil on the market.

And who else meshes up Middle East, offcourse USA did, not only general Wesley Clark wondered why Iraq was attacked after 9/11, cause there was no connection between Al-Qaida  and Iraq, only between USA and Al-Qaida(Afghanistan with Russian there) and Osama Bin Laden was a Saudi like the majority of the hijackers on 9/11.
And strange not ONE rich MUSLIM country is first to accept their fellow MUSLIMs! Not even in Mecca after Hadj? 
USA said well Sadam Hussein was a dictator, well most in Middle-East are, and he most are friends of USA.

Could/Can Syrian War be prevented? 
Yes, even 4 years ago, and even the Bosnian War could have been prevented.
REMOVE all vetorights for permanent members of UNSC, so only votes by majority counts.
Introduce a NO pay, no SAY principle in UN, now refugees don't get food/drink cause members owe UN 3.5 billion, the biggest? USA ofc.
And introduce a contribution based on GDP of countries, now EU pays 40% of UN budget and peackeeeping with it just 500 million people. Japan pays 2 times as much as China, and 4 times that of Russia, rich arab oil countries pay a LAUGHABLE 2% each.

When vetorights are removed, wars can fade away so also the consequence of wars: refugees!
UN can order noflyzones, blockades of areas for weapons and money, and get peace-getters and peacekeepers in, and build up country by country.

The permanent members of the UNSC, the UN ""security"" council are the real warmongers, they don't bring the world PEACE, but bring the world to PIECES.
The world belongs to all countries and people and 
not just the 5 permanent members of UNSC, USA, Russia, China, United KIngdom and France or is it?

Russia can not afford military intervention in Syria, Ukraine and Syria costs 82% defencebudget.

A cynic might say that the Russian intervention in Syria is motivated by the need to push the oil price which at the geopolitical unrest in some increase in the world. Without a substantial recovery in commodity prices will Russia does not succeed, the economic recession to overcome. However, the question is whether the cost of the interference in the end is not much higher than the possible yield.

A Russian Su-34 fighter jet bombs let loose over Syria.
For now, the relatively few Russians lost in operations in Syria, especially since they do little to precision bombing. The Moscow Times reported Tuesday, based on calculations by think-tank IHS Jane's that air strikes since late September have cost up to $ 115 mln. The total Russian defense budget of $ 50 billion is not that much. But if the engagement will be years where many military analysts take into account, or if Russia is forced to deploy ground forces to defend its naval base in Tartus, the price tag can add up quickly.
According to Igor Sutyagin of the Royal United Services Institute in London has the military in the first eight months of the year already 82% of the defense budget consumed again because of actions in Ukraine and scale exercises of the armed forces. The chances are high that the budget will be significantly exceeded. Already one fifth of government spending goes to defense and that is unsustainable.
Deep recession
Thanks to the left slumped commodity prices and the Western sanctions regime, the Russian economy is mired in a deep recession. No fewer than six times, the Russian government's growth forecast revised downwards. GDP is now 4.6% smaller than a year ago and although President Vladimir Putin claims that the economy is bottoming out, the central bank takes into account a minimum of more than 5% in 2016 if oil prices unexpectedly to below $ 40 drops per barrel.
""It's not that hard to get through manipulation of statistics to disguise the dynamics of the downturn,"" states Pavel Baev, attached to the think tank Jamestown Foundation. ""But it's impossible to cover up the rapidly increasing public deficit and keep the social programs up to date.""
Budget Overrun is not sustainable; now a fifth government spending goes to defense
Budget deficit
Russia's budget deficit this year expected to reach 4.4%. By international standards this is not so high - the national debt is 17% of GDP even very low - but the problem is that Moscow because of the sanctions has no access to international capital markets and thus nowhere to borrow money. Russian companies and households themselves are no longer able to put enough money aside and to fill the gaps in government.
Indeed, many companies are knocking on the government for help now end their foreign loans and no bank is willing them to roll. That costs the state $ 15 billion monthly at $ 25 billion. That money comes from temporarily foreign exchange reserves and the two state funds, but these buffers are shrinking rapidly. For the annexation of the Crimea Russia had a large $ 700 billion in reserves. Of which is now about $ 371 billion, which according to Standard &amp; Poor's is only a third 'useful'.
Contract with the people
Russia Connoisseurs like to say that Putin has a contract with his people. He offers them economic prosperity and physical security. In return, he can play the boss and enrich his faithful. The purchasing power decrease of at least 10%, and the many Russian victims in the Ukrainian civil contract do all violence. But it gets worse as soon jihadists come to take revenge for the Russian intervention in Syria, says Baev. ""It is clear that Moscow did not take account of the anger that evokes such military operations in the Arab world.""
He ominously adds to this that the Russian southern border is not only very long but also very porous.

1756," veto isn't basis of UNSC, their job is to provide Security worldwide , vetos make it UN-security...France, UK and USA already agreed to limit vetopower, russia (and china cause they want east-rf af RF fails)objects, best would be NO vetopower at all, NO pay, no SAY principle (USA 321 million people now witholds part (1 billion) from agreed contribution 22%) UN members now owe UN 3.5 billion, EU pays 40% of UN budget and peacekeeping with its 501 million people(7% w.p) while world population(w.p.) is 7.3 billion, so perhaps whole UN should be put out of USA influence sphere and be located in Eu(rope), Netherlands f.i. :-) , rich oilcountries pay a laughable percentage each.. Saudi Arabia 0.8- Qatar 0.2- Oman 0.1-Iraq 0.06-UAE 0,6 -Libya 0.1-Iran 0.3-Indonesia 0.3 -venezuela 0,6 (Israel pays 0.3 btw so a fair GDP share could/should also be in place.

Doing the above, UNSC would vote with its 15 members of which 5 permanent, by majority vote, btw another arrangment of (permanent) members  is also in order:  Japan 10.8% ,China 5%,  russia 2.4% (btw Mexico 1.8!)  it could use a shakeup not based on who has nukes but who pays more, in EUpart germany pays 7.1%, UK 5.1%-France 5.5.. 

BTW even at the moment  a UNSC veto can be neutralized , UNGA with art. 377 can with 2/3 majority override any veto of UNSC, at moment over 100 member states of 193 are OK with limiting vetorights in UNSC in case of atrocities and/or genocide.

A UNSC without vetorights can demand from memberstates to not interfere, or face sanctions, establish a no fly zone above a area or country, lock borders area/countries from arms, send in peace getters and after that peacekeeper.
(You can only keep what you have or have gotten)
and restore order and normal living conditions.

a UNSC without vetoright breaks both USA &amp; russia (and china, france , uk) and their allies hegemony.
NO more wars, NO more refugees that should be the basis of UNSC.",2015-10-02 11:09:00+00:00,cvljiql,1.0,t3_3n7ppd,50.0,russiawarinukraine

In other words, four companies decide what you eat, what you drink, what medications you get, what transport you drive, what operating system your computer is running, what kind of computer you have, WHERE WAR IS, which is being drilled for oil, how your home furnishings is what is on television, which run movies in theaters and how much fuel costs. Since these businesses want to gather as much wealth and power you can't expect that public health or wellbeing in their policies is a high priority

1830,"At the UN Security Council Russia, represented by Mr. Churkin, while keeping a self-important air, in fact taunts Ukraine, blocking all important decisions by using the right of veto (for example, after the annexation of Crimea). The discussion on launching a peacekeeping operation in Ukraine will be obstructed in the similar fashion. It is not possible to exclude Russia from participation in the discussion and voting on Ukrainian issues on the ground of being a transgressor in the conflict, and Russia cannot be expelled from the Security Council – the UN Charter will not allow it. But there is one judicial mechanism that Ukraine can use to negate Russia’s veto power.
In 1991 Russia declared itself a successor-state of the USSR, and took its place in the UN Security Council. But, legally speaking, all former Soviet republics which are now independent states could be regarded as the USSR’s successor-states.
The difference between the succession and continuation is that in the first case occurs a transfer of rights and obligations from one state to another state. In the second case – we are talking about the state which changed, for example, its name, some borders, political system, but at the same time retained its identity.
Take Ukraine as the case. Ukraine exists as a state since the year of 1917. It changed the name: used to be Ukrainian Soviet Republic, now Ukraine. In the course of time its constitution, political order, some borders changed. But the core identity remained intact.
In Russia’s case the opposite is true. USSR and Russia are two different subjects of international law. In 1991 the USSR had ceased to exist. This is why logically and legally Russia cannot be a ‘continuation’ of the state that ceased to exist as a geopolitical entity. By taking place of the USSR in the UN Security Council Russia grossly violated the UN Charter. If one will read the relevant documents, only USSR is referenced there, and not a word about Russia.
According to the UN Charter, Russia should have appealed to the UN General Assembly and Security Council to start the membership application from scratch. For example, Serbia was forced to take this path after the disintegration of Yugoslavia. Even though Serbia was a part of the Federation of Soviet Republics of Yugoslavia (FSRY), no one took it for the whole FSRY. It did not happen in the case of Russia.
In 1991 the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) – an aggregate of former Soviet Republics – approved the resolution to support Russia’s bid to take over the USSR’s membership in the UN, including the membership in the Security Council and other international organizations. Then Yeltsyn simply sent the UN a notification that ‘we are just, you know, taking the USSR’s place’. No one protested (this is a separate question – why), and this can be the only justification for Russia’s objections, should its membership in the UN be declared unlawful.
There is a legal subtlety that annuls the validity of the above mentioned CIS resolution. An agreement of CIS heads of states is a political decision, not an international treaty. It must not contradict the UN Charter (article 103), and cannot be regarded as a legal ground for Russia’s membership in the UN.
Some Russian authors also concede that the CIS decision was a political one, but argue that at the time that was an only possible solution, that someone had to take over the USSR’s responsibilities etc. But those are not legal arguments. The UN Charter was violated, and this is the most important consideration.
This is why now Ukraine can and should rescind its decision to support Russian membership in the UN as the successor of the USSR, and the situation should return to the ‘status quo ante’. E.g. the question on who should take the place of the USSR in the United Nation should be re-opened. This, by the way, should also open path to the Security Council’s reform.
In short, if our diplomats will show the willpower, decisiveness, methodical approach, and see this matter to its end, we will be able to restore the international rule of law, and kick out the aggressor from the UN. It will give a huge relief to the other nations, who are also harassed by this impostor.

Khudayr Taher: Europe and America Should Deport All Muslims – Including Myself

Khudayr Taher, an Iraqi Shi’ite writer living in the U.S. and a regular contributor to the liberal Elaph website, had a quite illiberal suggestion – he asked why Europe and America shouldn’t deport their Muslim populations. He wrote:

“Countries have the right to defend themselves and assure their citizens’ safety from terrorism. Likewise, it is clear that the source of the terrorist crimes in Europe and America is the Muslims who live in these countries.

“The security services cannot know people’s intentions and sort out who is the noble immigrant and who is a terrorist criminal. [But] wherever there are Muslims, their presence has produced crimes of terrorism and murder.

“Among those Muslims in Europe and America who do not practice terrorism, most of them do not have loyalty and sincere attachment to these countries that have offered them all of the means of life in dignity – housing, studies, work, and citizenship…

“The legitimate question is this: Since the security services cannot sort out the good immigrant from the bad terrorist… why don’t these countries deport all Muslims, of all races, from Europe and America, and [thus] find rest from the danger of terrorism, and protect their peoples?

“I, as an Arab Muslim immigrant, sincerely call on the countries of Europe and America to deport all Muslims from their territories – including myself, despite my love and my sincere attachment to the U.S…”

Shiite, which are supported by Iran which is also shiite-islamic. Also here the permanent members USA, Russia are the warmongers and the reason that USA lifts sanctions against Iran.
USA now even want to put in Al-Qaeda (which was founded and funded by USA) in fight against IS..!!

Also this can be stopped by these 2 permanent members of UNSC or else there will be a religious war between Shiite and Sunni muslims.

BTW, true or not, IS already announced they have infiltrated 4000 IS fighters  into the large refugeestream, so i wonder is this the plan of the big 3 permanent members of UNSC , besides a Middle East religious war also bring that to Europe?

Funny and call me cynical, that one of the countries USA, that together with Russia and China, most important permanent members of UNSC, who with the 3 cause the most of wars, dispairs, and 60 million+ refugees in the world, now discusses  if they should take refugees they themselves caused, or instead make it Europe´s problem. 
Solution is very simple, as with most problems,  no more vetopowers in UNSC will make Earth get finally get some peace, and prosperity.
USA always vetoes anything on Palestine, Russia always vetos anything on Syria &amp; UKRAINE..so who are you permanent members of UNSC trying to fool?

Emotional speeches of Samantha Powers or Angelina Jolie before UNSC, while EVERYONE knows its just for the buhne, cause one or more of the permanent members will veto any resolution!

Many blame UN for not acting, but it are the 3 biggest permanent members of UNSC that block any action.
BTW EU pays 40% of UN budget and peacekeeping, USA pays not full of what they've agreed, just 22%, and total owed by countries to UN is 3.5 billion..the rich oilstates many friends of USA, don't take refugees and pay a laughable percentage of UN budget. Every country should pay a percentage of their income, and when NO PAY, then NO SAY, permanent member UNSC or not!

Again, who are you blaming, or kidding??

Don't blame Europe, and don't blame UN, blame the permanent members of UNSC: USA, Russia and China specific.

Action counts not words! don't blame europe, Is simple angelina, take all vetopowers away from UNSC and wars and refugees go away, the P5 espec. USA &amp; Russia, China are the most responsible for all wars in the world. Btw arab/musllim take ZERO refugees, and pay a laughable part of UN budget, EU takes most of that.
Put the blame where it should lay, USA-Russia-China,UK and France should give up vetopowers.
Russia vetos all resolutions on Syria &amp; U K R A I N E , USA vetos all resolutions on Palestine.. and btw russian soldiers now fight in Syria...so don't blame Europe...

I've learned since last november 2013, best way to fight disinformation is as put as much information against it.
Not fighting kremlinmedia as such, its not worth my time, just believe the opposite, you can't go wrong with that.

If I see something in those reddits I'm banned in, I msg authors with links or reply.
A lot of them reply on me, when they see it posted on the reddits I post in.

Sofar on my own, I beat number posts alone in ukrainianconflict2 in quantity and quality, so in time that may replace that other one...haha

Mustafa Kemal Atatürk was an Ottoman and Turkish army officer, revolutionary statesman, writer, and the first President of Turkey. He is credited with being the founder of the Republic of Turkey. His surname, Atatürk (meaning ""Father of the Turks""), was granted to him in 1934 and forbidden to any other person by the Turkish parliament.

Atatürk was a military officer during World War I. Following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I, he led the Turkish national movement in the Turkish War of Independence. Having established a provisional government in Ankara, he defeated the forces sent by the Allies. His military campaigns led to victory in the Turkish War of Independence. Atatürk then embarked upon a program of political, economic, and cultural reforms, seeking to transform the former Ottoman Empire into a modern, secular, and democratic nation-state. Under his leadership, thousands of new schools were built, primary education was made free and compulsory, while the burden of taxation on peasants was reduced. The principles of Atatürk's reforms, upon which modern Turkey was established, are referred to as Kemalism.

1953,"Basically, worst fears about the deal confirmed by Gazprom.
In full:
Gazprom’s 30-year contract for gas supplies to China was based on an optimistic view of the oil market and offered no protection in the event of a prolonged period of low prices, the Russian company said on Monday.
The contract between the state-controlled Russian gas group and China’s CNPC was signed with much fanfare in May 2014, envisaging $400bn-worth of gas deliveries over 30 years in what Gazprom said was the largest contract in its history.
However, since then oil prices have fallen by more than 50 per cent, potentially imperilling the economics of the project, whose development cost Gazprom has estimated at $55bn.
Gazprom confirmed on Monday that the gas price under the contract with CNPC would be linked to a basket of oil product benchmarks.
Asked whether the contract built in protections to ensure that Gazprom would not make a loss in the event of a prolonged period of low oil prices, Pavel Oderov, a director at the company, said: “We have registered high risk appetite for this contract and we do not envisage such an event.”
Ildar Davletshin, oil and gas analyst at Renaissance Capital in Moscow, said that if current oil prices persist, the project, named “Power of Siberia”, would probably be unprofitable for Gazprom.
Analysts estimate that the gas price implied by the contract was around $350/thousand cubic metres when it was signed; given the 50 per cent decline in oil prices since then “it could be as low as $175/thousand cubic metres — clearly a lossmaking level”, Mr Davletshin said.
Separately, the Russian government is preparing to support the flagship project. According to a document published by the Kremlin on Monday, president Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian government to draw up by the start of September a “comprehensive action plan to ensure government support for the construction of gas transport infrastructure, including the Power of Siberia pipeline”.
Gazprom said it had no current plans to request government support, but that such a step may be necessary in the future.
“It is possible that the situation could change, that sanctions could get worse or the quantity of projects may increase. I do not exclude that in the future a situation may arise when government support is required,” said Alexander Ivannikov, Gazprom finance director.
The comments came as Gazprom reported a net profit of Rbs382bn ($6bn) for the first quarter of the year, a 71 per cent increase from a year earlier in rouble terms but lower in dollar terms as the results were flattered by the fall in the Russian currency.
The company suffered a decline in sales to Europe, the most important source of its revenues, with sales volumes declining by 16 per cent from a year earlier to 39.1 billion cubic metres for the period January-March. Prices in dollar terms also fell, down 23.7 per cent to $284.2/thousand cubic metres, as they followed oil prices lower.
The Russian economy ministry recently reported a 13 per cent drop in production for Gazprom for the first half of the year, and predicted that the company’s output would fall to a new post-Soviet low for the full year.
Gazprom has been hit by weaker demand in Europe driven by tepid economic growth and mild winters, combined with a significant loss of market share both in Ukraine, until recently one of its top markets, and at home in Russia, where it is under pressure from independent producers.",2015-08-25 09:20:55+00:00,cuewbz9,1.0,t3_3i8iju,51349.0,UkrainianConflict2

2025,"is no difference to that point between Russia and USA, with its 900 bases in 153 countries, its not to bring peace.
The P5 from UNSC still are behind every wargame, removing their vetopower in UNSC, would make the world a whole lot more peacefull.

Although any veto can be overthrown under UN article 377, to bring it under UNGA (UN general assembly) in a normal majority vote, then UNSC veto has no effect anymore. Most vetos btw are from USA regarding Israel.

MH17 art 377 under UNGA could get that majority I guess, Russia is not loved in the world.

Perhaps a number of states who are affected by a veto in UNSC should decide to go to UNGA, with a proposal to abolish the vetopower of the P5 in UNSC alltogether, seeing how ""loved"" USA, China, Russia, and lesser extent United Kingdom and France are that could perhaps even get a majority, despite fierce opposition and behind closed doors ""diplomacy"" (pressure) from the big 3 in P5.
P5 in UNSC are a relic from after WW2, and if their vetopower can't be abolished, perhaps UNSC should be abolished alltogether by art. 377.

Thats' my wishfull thinking.

2049,"51 years ago today, at the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis, second-in-command Vasilli Arkhipov of the Soviet submarine B-59 refused to agree with his Captain's order to launch nuclear torpedos against US warships and setting off what might well have been a terminal superpower nuclear war.

The US had been dropping depth charges near the submarine in an attempt to force it to surface, unaware it was carrying nuclear arms. The Soviet officers, who had lost radio contact with Moscow, concluded that World War 3 had begun, and 2 of the officers agreed to 'blast the warships out of the water'. Arkhipov refused to agree - unanimous consent of 3 officers was required - and thanks to him, we are here to talk about it.

His story is finally being told - the BBC is airing a documentary on it.

2139,"USA should have stayed away in Middle East, but with Crimea annexation putin signed his own death sentence.

The many russian descent, russian speaking east Ukrainians I know from kharkiv to Donetsk, Lugansk , Crimea are furiously angry with putin and now even with russian dogs as they call him, and some even their family in RF. (I know more russian speaking Ukrainians then Ukrainian speaking, I realize now counting them)

Putin just saw them as ethnic russians, but he forgot or didn't wanted to know after Holodomor, those russian families were deported to east-Ukraine by Stalin, so they hold a grudge towards kremlin, thats why on 4,5 million Girkin couldn't get 1000 volunteers.
Those deported russian families now see themselves as russian speaking Ukrainians, so they defend what they see as their country, and in my opinion rightfully so, but what goes for them doesn't go for Kremlin/Putin.

So Queen Victoria, GB has a claim on all english speaking areas in the world, that would be seen by nearly everybody even hers as ridicilous..


BTW, I dislike any agressor whether USA, China, Russia, Israel, Syria, most Gulfstates and even EU.
Saudi's try to get back on USA with their oildumping, will be $35-$20 for several years from now, so RF will go bankrupt, Kremlin already grabs from social services, pensions.

But I think the stratfor predict will come true in next 5 -10 years, RF will desintegrate in its 85 parts or ethnic llines, China will try take asian parts, that will be sanctioned like RF now, so social chaos also there, and EU will after that desintegrate too, cause USA/Germany will decline too, Scandinavian will go together, nort and south europe seperate, east-Europe will gather around Poland or Ukraine, think the first, so finally all P5 from UNSC are down..

Then, when the Horde began to fall apart, its focus has shifted to the Crimea, and Muscovy became a vassal territory, but with the prospect of growth.
Until 1700, the princes of Moscow regularly paid tribute to the Crimean khan.
However, in parallel, Muscovy expanded its territory.
Moreover, this expansion was due to the settings that were in the Horde.
Roughly speaking, the Horde was recovering. Somewhere in the West, has already started the Renaissance, it's time great discoveries born industry and science was restored, and Muscovy sought to restore the Horde, but under their own flags.
Then came Peter and became the king of Muscovy expand to the West.

It is clear that Europe show bloodthirsty nature of Muscovy, Peter decided not to and planned to rebrand.
He decided to show that its roots are in the realm of Byzantium, that is - in the Roman Empire, exactly where the roots of all European monarchies.
To do this, he needed to have a link - Kiev and appropriate name - Russia. Muscovy Rus was only in 1721 to the highest order of Peter.

 Their ancestry is recorded as follows: ""The ancestor of the genus Murza Zhdan Baranov, nicknamed the bar, and by baptism called Daniel, arrived in 1430 from the Crimea."" Karaulov Ogarevs, Akhmatova, Bakaev, Gogol, Berdyaev, Turgenev ... ""Ancestor kind Turgenev Murza Leo Turgen, and called for the baptism of John, went to the Grand Prince Vasily Ioannovich of the Golden Horde ..."" 
This kind of aristocratic attitude toward tukhum Horde, as well as the kind of Ogaryovo (Russia their ancestor - ""good name Kutlamamet Murza, nicknamed Ogar""). Karamzins (from Kara-Murza, Crimeans) Almazovo (from Diamonds by baptism called Erifeem, he came from the Horde in 1638), Urusov, Tukhachevsky (their ancestor in Russia was Indris, a native of the Golden Horde), Kozhevnikova (go on Murza-skin, with 1509 in Russia), bulls, Ievleva, Kobyakov, Shubin, Taneyev, Shuklin, TIMIRYAZEVO (Ibrahim was a Timiryazev, who came to Russia in 1408 from the Golden Horde).
Chaadaeva Tarakanov ... and continue to have for a long time. Dozens of so-called ""Russian families"" began to put the Tartars. But they built the lost Russia.
And after this perelitsovki and migration to the ""Russian"" canvas, Karamzin (see. Above) sculpt his famous story.
Tellingly, his entire 300-year history, the newly established Russia, trying to get out of the closet, two dusty corpse - the restoration of the borders of the Horde and the capture of Constantinople, for which he was in trouble.
After the revolution, the Bolshevik Russia has, with a sea of ​​blood trying to restore the Russian empire, and after the collapse of the scoop, Russia is trying to restore the Soviet Union.
Moreover, the people there were already familiar metamorphosis.
From comfrey Zhukva, oath of allegiance to the king and the country, to the nobility type Mikhalkov, when the Communists became Communists just spat and trampled the recent past, when the commune collapsed, princes and counts began to climb out of alleys, like cockroaches from the trash!
Those Mikhalkov, notebooks lackeys Bolsheviks are now columnar nobles and talk about the virtues of serfdom!
In this regard, to make a prediction. In a few years from that den under the abbreviation of the Russian Federation will have no choice.
But yesterday's ""elite"" will dig up the roots of Ukrainian and disown relations with today's tip.
As before, they are screwed to their surname ""s"" in order to become Russianized, then they will do the same, but with the end of the ""to"" or ""PAA"" to obukrainitsya.
However, these names Putin, Churkin and Lavrov - will not save anything.",2015-08-02 14:19:22+00:00,ctov3m6,1.0,t3_3fidis,86.0,UkrainianConflict2

not intermarium, you think anyone in Ukraine wants THAT, brotherly feelings towards Muscovy is gone for next 50-100 years,                 RF isn't russia, and russia isn't RF, that federation was not voluntary, putin itself introduced separatism  the other 84 parts can form their own RF and/or AF (asian), rf doesn't need moscovite-kremlin, kremlin-moscovite can't live without other 84 parts.
If russia besides Ukraine, parts of georgie, Chenchyna and moldava can also take on Belarus and Kazachstan, he's wrong....espec with ruble/oil/sanctions will get worse as soon as world realisizes it goes beyond Ukraine.

relations China with putin has cooled down and just ask Kazachstan , they would like to see a Asian federation, perhaps even China wants to join. and instead of the contaminated term RF, besides that AF it can be called EEF east european federation (perhaps even the(ex) eu (or at least its people) or ex-RFwants to join that ! BTW putin should have proposed THAT instead of going to war.. Like I wrote in march 2014. 
China as superpowers knows it has and wants to live by the rules of world political system(for now) but when RF falls, China will be first to try grab asian parts of RF.

Russia's War, Ukraine's History, and the West's Options
In Russia's invasion of Ukraine, history was presented as justification for war. Is there any resemblance between Russian justifications and historical consensus? What does it mean when ethnic claims trump international law? And should hate propaganda be seen simply as an instrument in one war, or an element of a larger strategy to destabilize the West?
Timothy Snyder is one of the world’s foremost scholars of Central and Eastern Europe, and the author of numerous critically acclaimed works of history, including Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin (2010), and The Reconstruction of Nations: Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, Belarus, 1569-1999 (2003). During the ongoing crisis in Ukraine, he has been a visible public intellectual, addressing questions of historical memory, narrative, and reconciliation both in his writing and through his public activism.

2314,"Is the war in Ukraine in ""the american (defense industry) interest""??
That should be the question.
If USA had let the nukes in Ukraine, Belarus, Kazachstan Europe would have been safe for centuries, but USA didn't want USSR to disslove, it made them a lot $$ in armsales to NATO members, who asked after Berlin Wall fell, where are those f*cing tanks, USA?
So not only russia should be held accountable, most of all the USA is!!
USA= U Stand Alone , unless we can make money of you...
USA is not a democracy but a oliarchy as Princeton study proved, it's not goverend by the people but by the big (defence)companies.

so yes arm Ukraine, so they at least can defend themselves, cause USA took the defence away..

and IS or ISIL, well we all know the Gulfstates and Saudi-Arabia founded and funded them, so adress that...

If Putin should go to int. court, USA should too, for breaking Lisbon Protocol AND Budapest Memorandum...  btw why no sanctions on putin himself, so he can receive the % of USA/NATO arms sales???  USA wanted to keep SU alive in 1991, cause they wanted to have a enemy, that would boost sales... USA  = U stand ALONE...

If Putin should go to int. court, USA should too, for breaking Lisbon Protocol AND Budapest Memorandum...  btw why no sanctions on putin himself, so he can receive the % of USA/NATO arms sales???  USA wanted to keep SU alive in 1991, cause they wanted to have a enemy, that would boost sales... USA  = U stand ALONE...

As you know we live in the greatest country in the world.
Its territory is 17,000 square kilometers
But few know that 85% of the territory are simply not liveable.
Permafrost, swamps, rivers, lakes
Part of the land is periodically flooded
Most of the territory is covered with mountains, forests, ravines and deserts
So, for the normal life the Russian people have only 15% of the whole territory
Slightly more than Sudan, but much less than Kazakhstan
The average annual yield of grain in Russia on non-black earth soil is 17 quintals per hectare
In Germany, France, Great Britain – 70 quintals per hectare
In Sweden – 60, in Ireland – 85
The total population of Russia is about 132 million people
60% are senior citizens, children, and people with disabilities
And only 20 million are working-age men
Among them, 1 million men are in jail
1 million serve in the MOE, the Ministry of Interior Affairs and FSB
4 million are chronic alcoholics
1.5 million are drug addicts
20 million out of 132 live in Moscow and the Moscow region
And only 31% of them are native Russians
The minimum salary in Russia is 4,330 rubles or 96 euros a month
Welfare of one prisoner in the colony is 6,800 rubles a month
I hope the metaphore is clear?
The poverty line for residents of the United States is 18,000 dollars a year for a family of 3 people
In Russia there are 160 regulatory authorities that may come to its residents with an inspection, of course, for taking bribes
Every year we give $ 3 billion of bribes to different instances
In 2009, material damage caused by economic crimes in Russia for the first time had exceeded one trillion rubles. It is almost 7.5 times more than the year before.
During the first quarter of 2009 employees of the Russian Interior Ministry had committed a total of 18,000 crimes
20 generals and admirals had been brought to justice
1,600 officers of the Russian Army had been sentenced
1.5% of the Russian population own 50% of the national wealth
The average Russian consumes 18 liters of alcohol per year
In 2008, 50 thousand people had gone missing
About 2 million children under the age of 14 years are beaten by their parents
50 thousand children run away from home to escape family and sexual violence every year
In Russia there are more than 2 million orphans
The number of sexual offenses against minors over the past 3 years has increased 25 times
In 2007 in Russia were killed 2.5 thousand children
And every minute 5 babies die and 3 are born
30% of children are born out of wedlock
Over the past 11 years, there have disappeared 11,000 villages, 290 towns in Siberia alone
26 thousand children do not live up to the age of seven
50 infants die every day, 70% of them die in maternity wards
In 2009, there have been initiated criminal proceedings against 186 directors of educational institutions
The amount of bribes in the sector of higher education has reached $ 520 million
Over the past 35 years, more than 40 million people have fled Russia.

Is it true that San Marino has the oldest Constitution? Apokrif 17:15, 27 March 2006 (UTC)

According to the general definition of constitution, San Marino has the oldest enduring constitution. For some reason, out of a number of small Italian republics from that period, this state has managed to survive to modern times. The only cautionary note is that the word 'statute' is used instead of 'constitution'. --Dlatimer 12:07, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

so NOT a statute is not a constitution, like russia is not a country, certainly not called russia, cause that name is Ukrainian, in 700 area Ukraine was called by arabs Russia, and black sea even russ sea

Bloodlands has been translated into more than thirty languages and was a bestseller in six countries.
