13,"&gt;Such is politics.

Such is *not* politics.  We create our own reality.  Obama has free will and can stay out of it, if he chooses.  The thing that sets our nation apart is once you have your time in the sun you step back and let the next person have a go.

&gt;But it's not like Bush doesn't deserve some of the blame he gets.

Blaming the other guy - rightly or not - doesn't really solve any problems.  Obama knew the scene when he ran... blaming someone else for everything is not what makes a great leader... leading makes a great leader.  I do not think Obama is a great (or even good) ""leader.""

I do not remember JFK saying, ""Let's blame everything on Eisenhower.""

&gt;Cutting taxes then starting 2 wars (1 justified, 1 maybe not so much) isn't a recipe for a stable economy.

*Congress* has the power of the purse per the U.S. Constitution.  And Congress also voted ""yes"" to Afghanistan *and* Iraq *and* there were nearly two decades of U.N. mandates regarding Iraq and WMDs *and* numerous Democrats including Bill and Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi *all* said that Iraq had WMDs.

&gt;At least Bush Sr. realized that keeping campaign promises was less important than doing what's right for the nation.

Fascism substituted the particularity of nationalism and racialism—“blood and soil”—for the internationalism of both classical liberalism and Marxism.

203,"“I want to pause here and talk about this notion of consensus, and the rise of what has been called consensus science. I regard consensus science as an extremely pernicious development that ought to be stopped cold in its tracks. Historically, the claim of consensus has been the first refuge of scoundrels; it is a way to avoid debate by claiming that the matter is already settled. Whenever you hear the consensus of scientists agrees on something or other, reach for your wallet, because you're being had.

Let's be clear: the work of science has nothing whatever to do with consensus. Consensus is the business of politics. Science, on the contrary, requires only one investigator who happens to be right, which means that he or she has results that are verifiable by reference to the real world. In science consensus is irrelevant. What is relevant is reproducible results. The greatest scientists in history are great precisely because they broke with the consensus.

There is no such thing as consensus science. If it's consensus, it isn't science. If it's science, it isn't consensus. Period.”

Here's an example of how a [religious freedom bill](http://www.wsj.com/articles/mike-pence-ensuring-religious-freedom-in-indiana-1427757799) would help:

&gt;For example, a public school in Texas in 2008 told a Native American kindergartner that he would have to cut his hair because of the school’s grooming policies. But keeping his hair long was part of his religious practice, which allowed his parents to prevail in federal court under RFRA.

And besides, the law Pence signed does not permit discrimination:

&gt;Some express concern that Indiana’s RFRA law would lead to discrimination, but RFRA only provides a mechanism to address claims, not a license for private parties to deny services. Even a claim involving private individuals under RFRA must show that one’s religious beliefs were “substantially burdened” and not in service to a broader government interest—which preventing discrimination certainly is. The government has the explicit power under the law to step in and defend such interests.

&gt;“I want to pause here and talk about this notion of consensus, and the rise of what has been called consensus science. I regard consensus science as an extremely pernicious development that ought to be stopped cold in its tracks. Historically, the claim of consensus has been the first refuge of scoundrels; it is a way to avoid debate by claiming that the matter is already settled. Whenever you hear the consensus of scientists agrees on something or other, reach for your wallet, because you're being had.

&gt;Let's be clear: the work of science has nothing whatever to do with consensus. Consensus is the business of politics. Science, on the contrary, requires only one investigator who happens to be right, which means that he or she has results that are verifiable by reference to the real world. In science consensus is irrelevant. What is relevant is reproducible results. The greatest scientists in history are great precisely because they broke with the consensus.

&gt;There is no such thing as consensus science. If it's consensus, it isn't science. If it's science, it isn't consensus. Period.”

And [this link](https://theintercept.com/2016/10/19/donald-trumps-voter-fraud-lies-are-part-of-the-gops-dna/) is just some angry Leftist rant.

971,"[""Common sense"" does not make something a fact.](https://corkskeptics.org/2011/05/03/the-common-sense-fallacy/) Nobody knows what GW Bush would have done had the situation been reversed.  

What we do know is that Al Gore only challenged the vote count in a few precincts in Florida... the ones that were most likely to ""flip"" for him.  He did not challenge for a recount for the entire state.

Additionally, Al Gore's people (and many leading Democrats) attempted to make the issue about Kathleen Harris and not the votes.  Not only did they attack her credibility but also her physical appearance.  Hillary Clinton - [2 years after](http://www.state.gov/secretary/20092013clinton/rm/2009a/08/127830.htm) the election - was still calling into question the legitamacy of the vote count and total.

So, for me, the 2000 effort and lawsuit was more about politics than it was about an actual counting of the votes and for that reason I do not think that it is ""common sense"" that Bush or any other politician would have acted the same way.

1450,"[You're using old data:](http://www.nature.com/news/global-warming-hiatus-debate-flares-up-again-1.19414)

&gt;An apparent slowing in the rise of global temperatures at the beginning of the twenty-first century, which is not explained by climate models, was referred to as a “hiatus” or a “pause” when first observed several years ago. Climate-change sceptics have used this as evidence that global warming has stopped.

 &gt;But in June last year, a study in Science claimed that the hiatus was just an artefact which vanishes when biases in temperature data are corrected1.

&gt;Now a prominent group of researchers is countering that claim, arguing in Nature Climate Change that even after correcting these biases the slowdown was real.

&gt;“There is this mismatch between what the climate models are producing and what the observations are showing,” says lead author John Fyfe, a climate modeller at the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis in Victoria, British Columbia. “We can’t ignore it.”

As I said...the models are wrong.

Now that we've dealt with that issue, the goal is definitely wealth redistribution:

[Ottmar Edenhofer, co-chair of the IPCC Working Group III:](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2010/11/18/ipcc-official-“climate-policy-is-redistributing-the-worlds-wealth”/)

&gt;Climate policy has almost nothing to do anymore with environmental protection, says the German economist and IPCC official Ottmar Edenhofer. The next world climate summit in Cancun is actually an economy summit during which the distribution of the world’s resources will be negotiated. – Ottmar Edenhofer

Regrding solar activity:

There are simply too many variables to know, too little time studied.  But Leftists definitely want to use it as an excuse to redistribute wealth.

Mr. SOROS: Right. I was 14 years old. And I would say that that's when my character was made.

KROFT: In what way?

Mr. SOROS: That one should think ahead. One should understand and–and anticipate events and when–when one is threatened. It was a tremendous threat of evil. I mean, it was a–a very personal experience of evil.

KROFT: My understanding is that you went out with this protector of yours who swore that you were his adopted godson.

Mr. SOROS: Yes. Yes.

KROFT: Went out, in fact, and helped in the confiscation of property from the Jews.

Mr. SOROS: Yes. That's right. Yes.

KROFT: I mean, that's–that sounds like an experience that would send lots of people to the psychiatric couch for many, many years. Was it difficult?

KROFT: No feeling of guilt?

Mr. SOROS: No.

KROFT: For example that, 'I'm Jewish and here I am, watching these people go. I could just as easily be there. I should be there.' None of that?

Mr. SOROS: Well, of course I c–I could be on the other side or I could be the one from whom the thing is being taken away. But there was no sense that I shouldn't be there, because that was–well, actually, in a funny way, it's just like in markets–that if I weren't there–of course, I wasn't doing it, but somebody else would–would–would be taking it away anyhow.

Dems also [opposed](http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/barone/2008/10/06/democrats-were-wrong-on-fannie-mae-and-freddie-mac) all Republican efforts to stop the shady activity:

&gt;Much if not all of that could have been prevented by a bill cosponsored by John McCain and supported by all the Republicans and opposed by all the Democrats in the Senate Banking Committee in 2005. That bill, which the Democrats stopped from passing, would have prohibited the GSEs from speculating on the mortgage-based securities they packaged. The GSEs' mission allegedly justifying their quasi-governmental status was to package or securitize such mortgages, but the lion's share of their profits—which determined top executives' bonuses—came from speculation.

So the facts do not agree with your version of reality.

President Obama delivering a speech, a powerful arc embracing hope and optimism, a passionate endorsement of Hillary Rodham Clinton and at times an artful takedown of Donald Trump, a call for Americans to participate in democracy.” And here was Holt’s description of Hillary’s big moment in the spotlight at the DNC: “Tonight from Philadelphia, history in the birth place of American democracy.” Holt has also been rather tough in his questioning of Trump during Trump’s attacks on Hillary, and supremely soft on Hillary (question to Hillary months ago: “How will you move the needle on race relations?

The article smears Trump but if you spend time to actually read it, they have no conclusions or evidence of wrongdoing:

&gt; In 2012, the tax return for Trump's foundation checked the boxes for ""no,"" it did not break the self-dealing rule.

&gt;But did it?

Let's examine some of that... this is based on an FBI informant who went on to become one of the top union bosses in NYC.  He is literally the *only* person to implicate Trump.

&gt;I also have a lot of trouble believing you don't understand how allegations of sexual misconduct would involve Trump personally without my explanation.

How about if someone alleged that you raped three women.  Now clear your name because you're an alleged rapist.  Why don't you look up the Duke lacrosse team?

**[In Shift, Massachusetts Governor Backs Gun Law](http://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/01/us/in-shift-massachusetts-governor-backs-gun-law.html)**

&gt;With voters growing increasingly fearful of gunfire on the streets, Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts reversed course this week and proposed some of the most stringent gun control laws in the country.

&gt;Mr. Weld, a Republican who will run for re-election next year, called for a statewide ban on assault weapons — a proposal he opposed during his 1990 campaign — as well as a waiting period for buying handguns and a prohibition on handgun ownership by anyone under 21. His proposed legislation would also limit the number of handguns an individual could buy and would impose tough penalties for illegal gun sales and gun-related crimes.

&gt;""The purpose of this common sense legislation is to remove deadly guns from our streets and to take weapons out of the hands of many teens who themselves are becoming deadly killers,"" the Governor said.

**[On carbon taxes:](http://reason.com/blog/2016/08/23/gary-johnson-on-climate-change-and-a-car)**

&gt;In any case, Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson agrees with me that man-made climate change is happening. Furthermore, Johnson in a CNBC interview also suggested that a carbon tax might be a ""very libertarian proposal"" to address the open access commons problem of climate change. Johnson is tentative, saying that he is ""open"" to considering a carbon tax. He specifically notes that a carbon tax would be a simple comprehensive way to replace all sorts of clunky expensive top-down centralized regulations and subsidies that aim to limit carbon dioxide emissions.",2016-09-07 16:55:43+00:00,d7czwq6,3.0,t1_d7czpco,261.0,Conservative

Ailes was caught between his friend Trump, his boss Murdoch, and his star Kelly. “Roger lost control of Megyn and Trump,” a Fox anchor said.

The U.S. Supreme Court found the voter [ID law in Indiana](http://www.in.gov/sos/elections/2401.htm) was Constitutional.  

They ruled there not only was sufficient voter interest in the law but that it was [not discriminatory:](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-21.ZO.html)

&gt;But if a nondiscriminatory law is supported by valid neutral justifications, those justifications should not be disregarded simply because partisan interests may have provided one motivation for the votes of individual legislators. The state interests identified as justifications for SEA 483 are both neutral and sufficiently strong to require us to reject petitioners’ facial attack on the statute. The application of the statute to the vast majority of Indiana voters is amply justified by the valid interest in protecting “the integrity and reliability of the electoral process.”

Furthermore, if such voter ID laws were ""racist"" then the following would not be true:

* Black turnout was higher than white turnout in 2012 — including in states that had implemented voter ID laws.

* A [recent study](http://reason.com/blog/2015/07/17/voter-id-suppression-fail) of the the 2010 and 2012 primaries and general elections shows that voter ID laws did not disproportionately decrease minority turnout. 

Lastly, voter fraud is rarely studied however your argument appears to be similar to someone saying they don't get into car accidents so they shouldn't wear a seatbelt.  Additionally, Liberals love to argue that if even one person loses their rights everybody does or if some law can save just ""one child"" we should do it.  I'd put the same standard on them for votes.

You can keep arguing with yourself but the facts, U.S. Supreme Court, and American public opinion are all at odds with your ""conclusions.""

Cruz and Trump had *exactly* the same percentage of positive and negative coverage.  Rubio and Kasich had *more* positive coverage.  

Based on what *you* said, Trump's positive numbers should be higher because you said:

&gt;The coverage of trump was positive and saturated in the beginning and he rose up because of it.

One of the errors you appear to be making is mistaking *amount of coverage* with *tone of coverage*:

&gt; There was not a single week when Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, or John Kasich topped Trump’s level of coverage. During the time that Rubio was an active candidate for the Republican nomination, he got only half as much press attention as Trump. During the time they were still in the race, Cruz received roughly two-thirds the coverage afforded Trump while Kasich got only a fourth.

However, looking at the *actual study* and not an excerpted story about it we see that your point doesn't seem to have much merit.

The *real story* is that Rubio was the one who got hammered:

2538,"Now that the flood waters ravaging Louisiana are receding, it's time for President Barack Obama to visit the most anguished state in the union.

Last week, as torrential rains brought death, destruction and misery to Louisiana, the president continued his vacation at Martha’s Vineyard, a playground for the posh and well-connected.

We’ve seen this story before in Louisiana, and we don’t deserve a sequel. In 2005, a fly-over by a vacationing President George W. Bush became a symbol of official neglect for the victims of Hurricane Katrina. The current president was among those making political hay out of Bush’s aloofness.

Sometimes, presidential visits can get in the way of emergency response, doing more harm than good. But we don’t see that as a factor now that flood waters are subsiding, even if at an agonizing pace. It’s past time for the president to pay a personal visit, showing his solidarity with suffering Americans.

Someone who created their account two days ago is not going to be treated the same as someone who has an older account that posts frequently.  If your account is 4 years old with one page of history and 120 karma you're going to get a long hard look at what you're about by me.

2832,"So basically... ""we don't know"" or ""we can't say.""

Notice the last bit I bolded.

&gt;No, I don't think that I can say that with any degree of certainty. What I can tell you is that to think one minimum wage is going to have the same impact everywhere at all points in time, that's not really consistent with what we're observing so far. Higher minimum wages are thought of as a way to maybe allow some of the spoils and the profits of society to be distributed towards the lower-income workers. And spreading those profits and that wealth around, it's a lot easier in a town like Seattle, where there is some wealth to spread. And it might not work so well in a place that is uniformly higher poverty, doesn't have as many of these tech sector jobs or other types of high-income employment to make it all work. So that is one thing that I can tell you. We are going to be paying close attention. **One thing that we have heard from employers is that the minimum wage is working just fine for them now, but that's not necessarily going to hold the next time a recession comes along.**",2016-08-10 20:53:55+00:00,d6cc3wv,2.0,t1_d6cbnzr,549.0,Seattle

Chamberlain would not have announced, ""Peace in our time"" if war was not likely.  Your point is false.

Sudetenland was not occupied by Germany, Crimea is occupied by Russian.  Fact.

&gt;Trump would not be dealing from weakness? 

Because he is not a sniveling apologist in the way Obama is, that's how.

&gt;When you've already removed military action from the list, what else do you have, especially against Putin? 

There is not enough information to conclude that so it is discarded.

&gt;As far as I know, Chamberlain never made public statements to the effect that he would not come to the aid of France or Czechoslovakia (excluding Sudetenland) or Poland. He still had the military card in his pocket, it's just that Hitler knew he still had time and fully expected war when the first shot was fired.

Hitler was pretty damn sure he had the upper hand which is likely why he did what he did, and won.

3860,"&gt; Cruz got killed by the media which wanted a Trump nominee, and they want that because they want a Hillary president.

Let's examine that for a moment.  You're making a few assumptions, the biggest one being that the voter will support whomever the media wants them to support.  This would assume that when McCain and Romney ran the ""media"" wanted Obama to win so he did.  Thus, it doesn't matter who runs because the ""media"" will always pick the winner.

I'm not buying this.  Cruz just didn't have a winning personality.  And had there been no Trump I think the GOP leadership would have been just as distasteful of Cruz as they were of Trump.

The GOP itself helped to create the conditions for the Tea Party - from whence Cruz sprang - so it is likely to conclude that the enemy is the GOP leadership.  You can like/dislike Cruz or Trump but they appear to be a natural reaction to ""throw the bums out.""",2016-07-07 00:37:25+00:00,d526gk5,5.0,t1_d523n7g,4252.0,Conservative

&gt;Damn. The only good thing about seeing Clinton win will be watching all you Trump fuckbois who've been sucking each other's dicks this whole primary bitching and moaning the day after the election when you realize Cheeto Jesus was just a chump with a lousy haircut and an addiction to spray tanning. #smegma

And:

&gt;Frankly, how Trump voters didn't figure out that during the primary a vote for Trump was a vote for Hillary is beyond me. But now it's our problem and we have to vote for Trump because you Trump fucks couldn't vote for Rubio, one of the only GOP candidates who polled well against HRC. So you Trump people gave us Cheeto Jeezus knowing he was going to be a shit show, and now you demand we vote for him because you are desperate to prevent the shit show you know is coming. And the reality is, the shit show is coming regardless.

He acknowledged he broke the rules and said he would like another chance.  I originally banned him and I un-banned him.

The two groups are unaffiliated, and Curiel is not a member of NCLR. But Trump may be concerned that the lawyers’ association or its members represent or support the other advocacy organization. 

&gt;Coupled with that question is the fact that in 2014, when he certified the class-action lawsuit against Trump, Curiel appointed the Robbins Geller law firm to represent plaintiffs. Robbins Geller has paid $675,000 in speaking fees since 2009 to Trump’s likely opponent, Hillary Clinton, and to her husband, former president Bill Clinton.

The two groups are unaffiliated, and Curiel is not a member of NCLR. But Trump may be concerned that the lawyers’ association or its members represent or support the other advocacy organization. 

&gt;Coupled with that question is the fact that in 2014, when he certified the class-action lawsuit against Trump, Curiel appointed the Robbins Geller law firm to represent plaintiffs. Robbins Geller has paid $675,000 in speaking fees since 2009 to Trump’s likely opponent, Hillary Clinton, and to her husband, former president Bill Clinton.

[Let's look at Arizona, which will ""flip to blue.""](http://i.imgur.com/bh7Uzc6.png)

Three polls... The most recent one is a dead tie (margin of error) with the second a slight advantage for Clinton (when there were three GOP candidates) and the last one a dead tie.... and that was when there were multiple candidates.  

[Looking at Georgia](http://i.imgur.com/SSGKAj1.png) we see a dead tie or advantage for either one depending on the candidate in the three most recent polls.  The 4th poll, taken more than a month ago, is when there were multiple GOP candidates.  The last two polls were from February.

5399,"Henry Ford was a virulent anti-Semite, which dovetailed nicely with Hitler's priorities.  Your little excerpt cites his ""support"" as somehow meaning that the NSDAP was ""right wing.""  That is a fallacy.

Regarding your wall-o-text, [I can do the same thing:](http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/hitler-and-the-socialist-dream-1186455.html)

&gt;It is now clear beyond all reasonable doubt that Hitler and his associates believed they were socialists, and that others, including democratic socialists, thought so too. The title of National Socialism was not hypocritical. The evidence before 1945 was more private than public, which is perhaps significant in itself. In public Hitler was always anti-Marxist, and in an age in which the Soviet Union was the only socialist state on earth, and with anti-Bolshevism a large part of his popular appeal, he may have been understandably reluctant to speak openly of his sources. His megalomania, in any case, would have prevented him from calling himself anyone's disciple. That led to an odd and paradoxical alliance between modern historians and the mind of a dead dictator. Many recent analysts have fastidiously refused to study the mind of Hitler; and they accept, as unquestioningly as many Nazis did in the 1930s, the slogan ""Crusade against Marxism"" as a summary of his views. An age in which fascism has become a term of abuse is unlikely to analyse it profoundly.

&gt;His private conversations, however, though they do not overturn his reputation as an anti-Communist, qualify it heavily. Hermann Rauschning, for example, a Danzig Nazi who knew Hitler before and after his accession to power in 1933, tells how in private Hitler acknowledged his profound debt to the Marxian tradition. ""I have learned a great deal from Marxism"" he once remarked, ""as I do not hesitate to admit"". He was proud of a knowledge of Marxist texts acquired in his student days before the First World War and later in a Bavarian prison, in 1924, after the failure of the Munich putsch. The trouble with Weimar Republic politicians, he told Otto Wagener at much the same time, was that ""they had never even read Marx"", implying that no one who had failed to read so important an author could even begin to understand the modern world; in consequence, he went on, they imagined that the October revolution in 1917 had been ""a private Russian affair"", whereas in fact it had changed the whole course of human history! His differences with the communists, he explained, were less ideological than tactical. German communists he had known before he took power, he told Rauschning, thought politics meant talking and writing. They were mere pamphleteers, whereas ""I have put into practice what these peddlers and pen pushers have timidly begun"", adding revealingly that ""the whole of National Socialism"" was based on Marx.

&gt;Yet privately, and perhaps even publicly, he conceded that National Socialism was based on Marx. On reflection, it makes consistent sense. The basis of a dogma is not the dogma, much as the foundation of a building is not the building, and in numerous ways National Socialism was based on Marxism. It was a theory of history and not, like liberalism or social democracy, a mere agenda of legislative proposals. And it was a theory of human, not just of German, history, a heady vision that claimed to understand the whole past and future of mankind. Hitler's discovery was that socialism could be national as well as international. There could be a national socialism. That is how he reportedly talked to his fellow Nazi Otto Wagener in the early 1930s. The socialism of the future would lie in ""the community of the volk"", not in internationalism, he claimed, and his task was to ""convert the German volk to socialism without simply killing off the old individualists"", meaning the entrepreneurial and managerial classes left from the age of liberalism. They should be used, not destroyed. The state could control, after all, without owning, guided by a single party, the economy could be planned and directed without dispossessing the propertied classes.

5522,"Obviously you are ignorant as to the origins of the NSDAP.  It was founded by the Strassers and was quite Socialist in nature.  Hitler joined and forced his way into a leadership position.  One of the Strassers died the other escaped.

But the NSDAP had a very strong membership of Socialists, at least until the mid-30s.  

The discussion has nothing to do with any type of Nazism that existed post-1945 so it is irrelevant.

I suggest you learn about the subject and - once you've done that - we can continue this conversation.

Since I'm a nice person you can start by [reading about the Strassers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strasserism#Ideology) and their vision for the party:

&gt;&gt;This populist and antisemitic form of anti-capitalism was further developed in 1925 when Otto Strasser published the Nationalsozialistische Briefe, which discussed notions of class conflict, wealth redistribution and a possible alliance with the Soviet Union. His 1930 follow-up Ministersessel oder Revolution ('Cabinet Seat or Revolution') went further by attacking Hitler's betrayal of the socialist aspect of Nazism, as well as criticizing the notion of Führerprinzip. Whilst Gregor Strasser echoed many of the calls of his brother, his influence on the ideology is less, due to his remaining in the Nazi Party longer and to his early death. Otto, meanwhile, continued to expand his argument, calling for the break-up of large estates and the development of something akin to a guild system and the related establishment of a Reich cooperative chamber to take a leading role in economic planning.

I hope you take this first step towards learning about that period of history in Germany.

They are certainly intent upon that... even to the point of their illegal island building activities.  I never said the purpose of those bases was to prevent invasion thus there is no ""false dilemma.""  Reducing our footprint to 0 or near it would, in the longterm, be a disaster I think.  Getting other nations to share the burden more is a better idea (as I've previously stated).

I do not believe our nation should have forces in as many countries as we do however if we look at [actual numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_deployments) you are not talking about large numbers in most cases.  The total is around 150,000.  Certainly, I think that number can be reduced but I wouldn't want to see it go to ""0.""

So what do True Scotsmen believe?  There is no such thing as ""True conservative ideology"" that is a logical fallacy as such there is no reason to waste time on it.

As I have previously said... "" if you want to argue that America should not carry as much of the burden of European defense, then you will have my interest.""

But saying we can't afford spending 16% of our GDP on defense (you are factually incorrect) is a different argument than saying our spending is *inefficient* or than saying we shouldn't be the ""world police.""

&gt;And your casual dismissal of the band issue shows me how out of touch you are with veterans.

Hardly.  You said the Air Force has 13 bands so, therefore, they somehow can't afford to keep the Marine flying (aside from the fact that the Marines are part of the Navy, not the Air Force).

I agree!  Defense, roads, and limited laws are the foundation of Conservative ideology.  Without a defended homeland you can't have anything else.

&gt;Additionally, if you took the next like 8 or 9 countries by expenditures on their defense and added them all together, the US still trumps them.

Do we really want to be like England and France which have to share an aircraft carrier between them?  Do we want to be like China who cannot project any useful force very far from their borders?  No.  That is a lousy argument.

Now if you want to argue that America should not carry as much of the burden of European defense, then you will have my interest.

&gt;I literally just told you the problem is that there is wasteful spending all through the forces. The US Air Force has like THIRTEEN bands. Thirteen. 

You seriously expect me to believe that tuba players are why so many Marine planes are grounded?  That is absurd.

&gt; the atrocious allocation of resources and the broken method of how we expend our funds is the problem.

Define ""too much.""  You think 16% of our budget is ""too much?""  Why... specifically?

This is kind of that way for *any* agency in the Government whether it is the military or the Dept. of Agriculture.  I don't see how that is specific to the military.

6950,"All good things come to those who wait:

&gt;But, whatever the reasons, the fact is that Kansas had a large negative shock to its overall budget in 2014 and 2015, which was only peripherally related to Brownback’s tax bill.  But such a shortfall always causes an uproar: warnings of school closures, fears of lessened police protection and threatened lack of funds for the needy.  2014 being an election year, the normal hype was greatly magnified by 1.) the disgruntled anti-Brownback former Senators who had been thrown out of office and now sided with Brownback’s Democratic challenger, 2.) a vulnerable Senator Pat Roberts running for reelection and 3.) the reelection campaign for Governor Brownback himself.  It was the perfect storm, attracting nationwide attention, including numerous editorials even from The New York Times and N.P.R., no less.


&gt;In November 2014, in spite of all the national backlash, Brownback was easily re-nominated and reelected, along with U.S. Senator Pat Roberts.  After the elections, the Kansas House and Senate were even more Republican than they had been when Brownback took office, with 97 Rs to 28 Ds and 32 Rs to 8 Ds, respectively—hardly a wholesale repudiation of Brownback, his slate of legislators or supply-side economics.  Apparently, the electorate really doesn’t want to balance the state’s budget by unbalancing the budgets of everyday Kansans.


&gt;Now for some fun stuff.  Today, Kansas’ unemployment rate is 3.9%, the 11th lowest in the nation.  Kansas’ private sector employment is growing faster since the tax cuts took effect than all of its neighbors, save for steroidal Colorado.  Kansas City, Kansas is adding more private sector jobs than is Kansas City, Missouri.  Income taxes for individuals, families and small businesses have been reduced by 30%.  Kansas’ pension funding is now 22nd best in the nation—a vast improvement from the state’s second-worst in the nation ranking back when Governor Brownback took office.  The pension system’s funding ratio is now 62% and projected to soon rise to 66%—considered well into the “safe zone” as far as funding ratios go.  And, lastly, Superman, Wyatt Earp and Dorothy are cheering like mad in heaven.


&gt;And all of this is happening when agricultural product prices and oil prices are at recent lows.  Just wait and see what happens when these pro-growth policies have had sufficient time to have their full supply-side effects materialize.


&gt;And one observation appears very much in order.  Because of Brownback’s policies, the legislature in Missouri passed a 10% income tax rate cut, which the less than enlightened Missouri Governor Jay Nixon quickly vetoed.  But not to be put off, Missouri’s legislature then passed the tax cut over the Governor’s veto.  Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.

Bratton says such incidents have been omitted consistently since the department started tracking shootings during his first stint as commissioner in 1994. But he pointed out that both types of shootings are counted as aggravated assaults in official stats reported to the FBI.

The facts are that criminals do not follow laws.  That's why they're criminals.  States that have allowed or expanded CCW have seen their murder rates decline.  England and Australia mostly banned guns and saw stabbings increase.  Those are facts.

7695,"I think it really depends where you look for your ""answers.""  There are many questions like if Cruz was the favorite why did Trump [win the evangelical vote](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/us/politics/donald-trump-despite-impieties-wins-hearts-of-evangelical-voters.html?_r=0)?  

And what about the [black and Hispanic vote](http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2015/12/breaking-poll-40-of-blacks-line-behind-trump-45-of-hispanics/) Trump seems to be putting them into play as well.

There were numerous polls showing [Romney defeats Obama](http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2011/12/romney-leads-obama.html) and we know how that went:

&gt;For the first time in PPP's monthly national polling since July 2010 Mitt Romney's taken a lead, albeit a small one, over Barack Obama.  He's up 47-45.

&gt;Romney has two main things going for him.  He leads the President 45-36 with independents. And he's also benefiting from a much more unified party with 88% of Republicans committed to voting for him while only 83% of Democrats say they'll vote for Obama.

So I don't think a Hillary win is a done deal.  I think both candidates are highly poisonous and divisive. ",2016-03-16 16:17:04+00:00,d123hmf,6.0,t1_d11zk95,5492.0,Conservative

8338,"Our sub's mission statement is pretty clear:

&gt;&gt;We provide a place on Reddit for conservatives, both fiscal and social, to read and discuss political and cultural issues from a distinctly conservative point of view.

Nowhere in that statement does it describe how we are there to answer questions from non-Conservatives fed up with the similar perspectives they get across Reddit.

If non-Conservatives want this, there is a sub devoted to this purpose:  /r/askaconservative

Having a polite conversation with someone happens all the time and is something we encourage.  When someone steps over the line and says things like ""Conservatives are anti-XYZ"" or get sarcastic with things like ""how did that work out in the last electon?"" *then* we have a problem.

The purpose of our sub - as clearly stated - is for *Conservatives* to be able to discuss things with *other Conservatives*.  If our subscribers want to discuss things with non-Conservatives it's pretty easy for them to do so... they simply go almost any other place on Reddit.

Everyone else is a *guest* and that privilege may be revoked at any time.

The Conservative value that we uphold is *freedom of association*.

We look at this sub as our living room and if someone is no longer welcome here their ""freedoms"" are not being abridged they are just being told they need to leave our home because they are being disruptive to everyone else.",2016-02-25 17:32:55+00:00,d0dgkic,1.0,t3_47gz32,50790.0,ConservativeMeta

My personal feeling is Rand would do the best job of reining in the GOP but we all know that isn't going to happen.

So what about Cruz?  I like him.  I like his buddy, Mike Lee.  I think he's a smart guy.  I don't see him as have the soft skills to get things done with *either* party.

The GOP is divided itself.  Strong on the local level, weak nationally.

Sometimes you have to mow everything down to get new growth.

In all truth, I don't like any of the candidates who have a chance.  Trump exists, I think, because people feel sold out by the GOP and the Democrats.  I think people like that he is giving it right back to the Liberals.  He's a deeply flawed candidate in many respects - so is Cruz in his own way - but I guess if the voters want to give the finger to the Establishment then Trump will win.",2016-01-22 00:50:36+00:00,cz77l3g,6.0,t1_cz75s4p,2865.0,Conservative

&gt;Rather than talking about putting up a fence, why don't we work out some recognition of our mutual problems? Make it possible for them **to come here legally with a work permit**, and then, while they're working and earning here, they'd pay taxes here. And when they want to go back, they can go back. They can cross. Open the borders both ways.

Reagan clearly stated **work permit** which means *legal* immigration.

That is *very different* from the *illegal* immigration we have today which is, by its very definition, against the law.

""Open borders"" means anyone comes and goes from any country.  This is not what Reagan said... *within a permit system*.

&gt;Reagan did legalize some three million illegal immigrants in 1986 **in exchange for stringent border security that never happened**. As the immigration and amnesty debate rages today, Shirley said Americans should understand the context in which Reagan agreed to the immigration deal.

&gt;&gt;The First Amendment gives legal protection to most speech, it doesn't give social protection. So when protesters demand that someone be fired because they said something they didn't like, nobody can invoke First Amendment arguments. In that regard, there is no free pass or freedom from consequence.

Actually there was, hence my reply.

The original point:

&gt;&gt;I'm ok with allowing states to make the rules that work for their residents to avoid that risk.

In other words... *each state* should set their own firearms laws (CCW is a function of that, btw).  I simply asked why this should be different from a driver's license.

The way CCW works now, Texas may honor an Arizona permit but not one from California so while I can legally carry in one state I'd be in violation in another state... *unlike a driver's license*.

The Government can *allege* whatever they want (as can you or I) however it doesn't make it correct, which was my point.

Incorrect.  I stated that the fire was apparently not set intentionally.  That is all I said.  This is very different than someone going on to someone's land and setting a fire.

&gt;If one agrees that the fire was set to destroy evidence

I don't believe I agree with that.

I have read it was done to rid their land of an invasive species and the fire spread.

&gt;&gt;Fannie and Freddie already back 60% of all mortgages originated in the private market and guarantee 90% of all new mortgages underwritten. When they set a standard, the entire mortgage industry follows.

[Back to the original housing boom:](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/11/business/new-agency-proposed-to-oversee-freddie-mac-and-fannie-mae.html)

&gt;&gt;September 11, 2003

&gt;&gt;The Bush administration today recommended the most significant regulatory overhaul in the housing finance industry since the savings and loan crisis a decade ago.

&gt;&gt;Under the plan, disclosed at a Congressional hearing today, a new agency would be created within the Treasury Department to assume supervision of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored companies that are the two largest players in the mortgage lending industry.

&gt;&gt;The new agency would have the authority, which now rests with Congress, to set one of the two capital-reserve requirements for the companies. It would exercise authority over any new lines of business. And it would determine whether the two are adequately managing the risks of their ballooning portfolios.

As I said... the Bush admin tried to rein in Congress... didn't work.

9890,"[Here are three:](http://www.rinotracker.us/another-warning-about-marco-rubio/)

&gt;1. Rubio vehemently ignored the desires of conservatives (just like Democrats) and had every intention of force-feeding America his amnesty bill. The day after Tuesday’s debate, he went on “CBS This Morning” and said “You have to bring illegal immigration under control and prove to the American people that that’s happened, then you have to modernize your legal immigration.” Sounds good, right? Except when he had the chance to do that in 2013 he flatly rejected it. Yet we are expected to believe he isn’t lying this time? Then he followed with something interesting… “Conduct background checks on everyone who’s here illegally and if they are criminals they have to leave.” Stop right there. Whether or not they continued a life of crime is irrelevant because the fact that they are “HERE ILLEGALLY” (his words) constitutes being a criminal by default. Rubio is attempting his very best shuckin’ and jiving,’ along with smoke and mirrors, to once again blur the lines of reality and sell sugar-coated malarkey. He then goes on to say those who aren’t criminals (translation: those who haven’t been caught and/or prosecuted) are rewarded with work visas good for 10 years! In short, it’s de-facto amnesty.

&gt;2. Rubio supports crony capitalism aka corporate welfare, namely sugar subsidies. Sugar farmers supply lobbying funds in exchange for the freebies. So much for limited government and the “free market,” because Rubio has no qualms about picking winners and losers. 

&gt;3. Rubio actually thinks we should spend our tax dollars to rebuild after fighting ISIS. How about we just eliminate the terrorists and the Middle East can thank us by rebuilding themselves?

The study (later published as the book Armed and Considered Dangerous) found that **gun shows were such a minor source of criminal gun acquisition that they were not even worth reporting as a separate figure**.

10388,"Yes they did.  Which has nothing to do with Obama and his numerous fuck-ups.

However, the 9-11 attack came after these attacks under Bill Clinton:

1993 World Trade Center bombing

1996's first declaration of war against America by al Qaeda

1996 Khobar Tower bombing

1998 Kenya bombing

1998 Tanzinia bombing

1998's second declaration of war against America by al Qaeda

2000 USS Cole bombing

And who can forget what happened in Somalia as seen in the film ""Blackhawk Down.""

What did Bill Clinton teach our enemies about our resolve when he pulled the troops out?  Let's look at OBL's fatwa against the US:

&gt;Few days ago the news agencies had reported that the Defence Secretary of the Crusading Americans had said that “the explosion at Riyadh and Al-Khobar had taught him one lesson: that is not to withdraw when attacked by coward terrorists“.

&gt;We say to the Defence Secretary that his talk can induce a grieving mother to laughter! and shows the fears that had enshrined you all. Where was this false courage of yours when the explosion in Beirut took place on 1983 AD (1403 A.H). You were turned into scattered pits and pieces at that time; 241 mainly marines solders were killed. And where was this courage of yours when two explosions made you to leave Aden in lees than twenty four hours!

&gt;But your most disgraceful case was in Somalia; where- after vigorous propaganda about the power of the USA and its post cold war leadership of the new world order- you moved tens of thousands of international force, including twenty eight thousands American solders into Somalia. However, when tens of your solders were killed in minor battles and one American Pilot was dragged in the streets of Mogadishu you left the area carrying disappointment, humiliation, defeat and your dead with you. **Clinton appeared in front of the whole world threatening and promising revenge , but these threats were merely a preparation for withdrawal. You have been disgraced by Allah and you withdrew; the extent of your impotence and weaknesses became very clear.** It was a pleasure for the “heart” of every Muslim and a remedy to the “chests” of believing nations to see you defeated in the three Islamic cities of Beirut , Aden and Mogadishu.

Bill Clinton's weakness was on full display... and OBL learned then that he could attack and attack and we would not fight him.

And it is worth nothing the *second* World Trade Center attack was several *years* in the making and no attacks here until Obama. ",2015-12-05 06:05:16+00:00,cxnu16t,2.0,t1_cxntq3z,814.0,Conservative

Could be founded on many things.  It could rest on facts.  Speculation.  Wanted to get your paper published or get funding.  Could be based on a lack of understanding.

&gt;“I want to pause here and talk about this notion of consensus, and the rise of what has been called consensus science. I regard consensus science as an extremely pernicious development that ought to be stopped cold in its tracks. Historically, the claim of consensus has been the first refuge of scoundrels; it is a way to avoid debate by claiming that the matter is already settled. Whenever you hear the consensus of scientists agrees on something or other, reach for your wallet, because you're being had.

&gt;Let's be clear: the work of science has nothing whatever to do with consensus. Consensus is the business of politics. Science, on the contrary, requires only one investigator who happens to be right, which means that he or she has results that are verifiable by reference to the real world. In science consensus is irrelevant. What is relevant is reproducible results. The greatest scientists in history are great precisely because they broke with the consensus.

&gt;There is no such thing as consensus science. If it's consensus, it isn't science. If it's science, it isn't consensus. Period.”

In the primetime demo, Fox News held the number one spot (and a 14 percent increase) with 311,000 viewers, followed by CNN’s 204,000 and MSNBC’s 136,000.

Granted, this is from June but it hasn't changed that much.  The difference is... 3-5 million viewers just as I said.

10794,"&gt;Now I'm just confused, your country has how many mass shootings a year? Lots? Too many?

Not sure why you're ""confused"" unless you're trying to make sense of the data (which is often inaccurate and flawed).

A ""mass shooting"" is considered 4 or more people shot at the same time.  If you're looking online for this info you're probably finding shootingtracker however [they lie](http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2015/10/foghorn/shootingtracker-com-uses-pellet-guns-to-boost-mass-shooting-numbers/) and cannot be trusted as they are run by anti-gun folks.

When these ""mass shootings"" were investigated, many of them were found [to be bogus.](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/12/03/fbi-mass-killing-data-inaccurate/3666953/)

I think we can quickly see the difference between an ISIS-backed killed mowing down 8 people on a public bus vs. a postal worker killing his boss and 7 other people or a father killing his family and himself.

What I ""resolve"" I [commented about earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/3tvdje/college_liberal_at_it_again/cx9tzfj).

If you take the wack job who shot up a theater in Colorado vs. a potential ISIS terrorist attack a simpleton could tell the difference: one is an isolated act of a crazy person while the other is a concerted effort to wage war against this nation and its people and create a climate of fear.",2015-11-24 06:05:40+00:00,cxb4otk,4.0,t1_cxb3d5y,3055.0,Conservative

[In reality, it is an inaccurate metric that has changed over the years.](http://crimeresearch.org/2015/07/washington-posts-misleading-article-mass-shootings-falsely-claiming-204-mass-shootings-in-204-days-this-year/).

[Here are some things USA Today found when it investigated this:](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/12/03/fbi-mass-killing-data-inaccurate/3666953/)

* In nearly a dozen cases, USA TODAY — searching media reports and interviewing local law enforcement agencies — could find no record of a murder, even when the FBI data showed as many as seven killed. Among them: a quintuple murder in Newark in 2010. What actually happened: Police arrested two men in connection with the murder of five teens in 1978 — 32 years earlier.

* At least a dozen crimes were mischaracterized as mass killings. In one case, several unrelated homicides a week apart were reported as a mass killing.

&gt;USA TODAY's data debunks common beliefs. For example, it shows that the number of mass killings has not increased in recent years; most occur among family members; and handguns, not assault weapons, are most commonly used.

Lastly, the link you provided [blatantly lies](http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2015/10/foghorn/shootingtracker-com-uses-pellet-guns-to-boost-mass-shooting-numbers/) by using pellet guns instead of firearms - examples are linked.

If you want to speak intelligently on a subject and not be taken as a fool you need to understand the facts not make them up.

In 1966 upon being told that President Charles DeGaulle had taken France out of NATO and that all U.S. troops must be evacuated off of French soil President Lyndon Johnson mentioned to Secretary of State Dean Rusk that he should ask DeGaulle about the Americans buried in France. Dean implied in his answer that that DeGaulle should not really be asked that in the meeting at which point President Johnson then told Secretary of State Dean Rusk:

""Ask him about the cemeteries Dean!""

That made it into a Presidential Order so he had to ask President DeGaulle.

So at end of the meeting Dean did ask DeGaulle if his order to remove all U.S. troops from French soil also included the 60,000+ soldiers buried in France from World War I and World War II.

DeGaulle, embarrassed, got up and left and never answered.”

11586,"&gt; Ok, you clearly have no idea how pipelines work, and what a pipeline spill is compared to ship spill.

This is about what's safer.

&gt;[Moving oil and gas by pipeline was 4.5 times safer than moving the same volume the same distance by rail in the decade ended in 2013 in Canada, according to a new study by the Fraser Institute public policy think-tank.](http://business.financialpost.com/news/energy/pipelines-much-safer-than-shipping-oil-by-rail-fraser-institute-study-says)

&gt;[But in terms of amount of oil spilled into waterways used by people (and difficult to clean up) per equal amounts shipped during the 24-year period covered in the study, the research found that trains are less efficient since they spill a greater portion of their units during transport.](http://www.ibtimes.com/whats-safest-way-transport-oil-us-transportation-state-departments-wont-say-1172847)

So if your goal is to set the conditions for *worse* spills then making sure there is no pipeline is the best way.

Obviously you cannot understand how drilling in 1,000 feet water is safer than in the 18,360 feet of water the Deepwater Horizon well was set then, well, you don't have much common sense.",2015-11-07 18:31:46+00:00,cws03zw,6.0,t1_cwrzmxu,832.0,Conservative

&gt;Since 2008, Congress has had to replenish the trust fund with $55 billion in general funds. This isn’t, however, a subsidy to highways; **in the last decade, Congress has diverted well over $55 billion of gas taxes to non-highway projects.**

&gt;Contrary to popular reports, our highways and bridges are in great shape. Despite the fact that Congress has diverted well over a fifth of gas taxes to non-highway projects, the number of bridges considered “structurally deficient” has declined by more than 50 percent since 1990 and the average smoothness of our roads has increased every year.

&gt;Cars are getting more fuel-efficient each year and growing numbers of electric cars don’t use gasoline at all.

&gt;The paper analyzed 800 fatal police shootings and found that in 74% of the cases, police pulled the trigger only after the suspect fired, brandished a gun or attacked someone. In 16% of the shootings, cops fired when the suspect acted in a dangerous and threatening manner, such as refusing to put down a knife.

&gt;In 5% of the cases, officers used force when the suspect refused to show his hands and made a sudden move that made them think he was reaching for a weapon. The Post said the justification for force in the remaining 5% of cases was undetermined.

Amazing what you learn when you read the article, eh?

True, it makes the watch look like something from Victorinox, but I think it goes well and on hikes won't have all the problems leather seems to exhibit (particularly when it gets wet).

German asylum law:

&gt;If the asylum application is accepted, persons granted asylum status and those granted refugee status receive a temporary residence permit and are given the same status as Germans within the social insurance system. They are entitled to social welfare, child benefits, child-raising benefits, integration allowances and language courses as well as other forms of integration assistance.

&gt;If neither asylum nor refugee protection can be granted, the BAMF examines in the course of the asylum procedure whether there are grounds for a deportation ban. This obligation to conduct an extensive review is intended to ensure that there is no delay in processing. Separate from the asylum procedure, the responsible foreigners authority requests an expert opinion from the BAMF and examines whether a deportation ban applies.

&gt;*As a rule, asylum seekers whose applications have been rejected are required to leave the country.*

Actually, the lowest-ranked broadcast news program easily outranks the highest watched Fox New show... by millions.

[CBS has 7+ million](http://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/evening-news-ratings-week-of-sept-28-2/273797)

[Fox News averages 1.8 million](http://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/cable-network-ranker-week-of-september-28/273840)

So if you're trying to argue that a network that gets 5+ million fewer viewers on average than the lowest ranked broadcast news show but yet has more influence... good luck.

12774,"&gt; To get a better argument, you would need to quantify gun laws in each state (the original argument suggests a total number of laws, the spirit of the argument is probably closer to the severity of those laws - gathering both would be fair). Then quantify gun deaths in each state (again, the original argument suggests total gun deaths - but non-suicide, yet including accidental gun deaths would be closer to the intent - including all the semi-pertinent gun death, gun violence, suicide, and accidental data would be best). Then plot all that data on several charts. Each including a trendline to see if the statement holds as true.

12869,"&gt;&gt; That is how consensus is generally reached in science.

&gt;“I want to pause here and talk about this notion of consensus, and the rise of what has been called consensus science. I regard consensus science as an extremely pernicious development that ought to be stopped cold in its tracks. Historically, the claim of consensus has been the first refuge of scoundrels; it is a way to avoid debate by claiming that the matter is already settled. Whenever you hear the consensus of scientists agrees on something or other, reach for your wallet, because you're being had.

&gt;Let's be clear: the work of science has nothing whatever to do with consensus. Consensus is the business of politics. Science, on the contrary, requires only one investigator who happens to be right, which means that he or she has results that are verifiable by reference to the real world. In science consensus is irrelevant. What is relevant is reproducible results. The greatest scientists in history are great precisely because they broke with the consensus.

&gt;There is no such thing as consensus science. If it's consensus, it isn't science. If it's science, it isn't consensus. Period.”

One U.S. woman in eight can expect to have the disease at some point in her life, compared with one in nine in Britain.

But five-year survival rates for all forms of the disease - including the most advanced - stand at 85 per cent in the U.S and just under 74 per cent in the UK. If the cancer is caught early - at what doctors call stage 1 - the differences in survival are even more shocking.

**An American woman has a 97 per cent chance of being alive five years after diagnosis.
In Britain, this figure is only 78 per cent.**

**Routine breast screening in the U.S. starts at 40 rather than 50, as in Britain, and women are thoroughly checked every one to two years, rather than every three years under the NHS.**

&gt;So Heather, a Novogenix person would come to the site, and our staff would sign the patients up, and get consent. Heather would look at the tissue and take what she required, so logistically it was very easy for us, we didn’t have to do anything.

If PP really had to do nothing their ""cost"" would be very low yet Gatter insisted on horse trading on price.  That does not make sense.

And why would she say things like this:

Nice ad hominem... it really makes your arguments stronger!

Now, as to ""capacity size"" and ""crime.""

Researchers and stuff did this thing called a ""study"" and [guess what they found?](http://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/9/2/151.full)

&gt;Given that the gun was fired, the average number of shots in pistol cases ranged from 3.23 to 3.68, based on minimum and maximum estimates (table 1). In contrast, the average number of shots in revolver cases ranged from 2.30 to 2.58.

And out of that... usually only one shot was fired:

&gt;Further inspection of table 1 shows that about two thirds (68.5%) of pistol cases but only about half (52.1%) of revolver cases involved multiple shots according to the minimum shots fired estimates.

So, we can say that, *factually speaking*, ""magazine size"" is irrelevant and, in the example of the mayor and police chief... since the data is not recorded they're talking out of their ass.  But that's how things roll in DC and why crime had always been a problem there since the riots.

Was $575 direct from their website and delivery takes about 2 weeks.  The watch is slim (as its name suggests) and light on the wrist.  The Perlon band makes you feel like it's not even on.

A nice watch, overall, and at just $550 it's a bargin.  They do have a slightly smaller Quartz watch for less but that isn't my thing.

I really like the clean design of Stowa's watches.  The Marine model is my favorite out of all of them.  Has a manual-wind Unitas 6498 movement.

Stowa also offers engraving.

On its original black leather band with deployment clasp the watch had a very formal look.  I felt the blue hands were washed out so I decided to throw a blue and white Nato band on.  While I'm not the biggest fan of these, the colors do compliment the watch and, I think, make it seem a little less serious.

Stowa's build quality is simply amazing and the dial seems like it's made of porcelain.

Nice thing about this watch is it looks great no matter how you are dressed and whether you're on a sailboat or at a formal even (though I'd probably not go with the Nato band for that).",2015-08-20 18:51:47+00:00,cu9s4hm,1.0,t3_3hr37k,21.0,Watches

&gt;Human embryos, whether they are formed by fertilization (natural or in vitro) or by successful somatic-cell nuclear transfer (SCNT — i.e., cloning), do have the internal resources and active disposition to develop themselves to the mature stage of a human organism, requiring only a suitable environment and nutrition. In fact, scientists distinguish embryos from other cells or clusters of cells precisely by their self-directed, integral functioning — their organismal behavior. Thus, human embryos are what the embryology textbooks say they are, namely, human organisms — living individuals of the human species — at the earliest developmental stage.

&gt;Republicans in Vermont and Washington, D.C., are trying to use an issue that has hurt some of their own officeholders in the past to allege that Rep. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has personally benefited from serving in public office.

&gt;Sanders, who is seeking the Senate seat being vacated by Sen. Jim Jeffords (I-Vt.), is fighting back, saying that his likely Republican opponent, millionaire businessman Richard Tarrant, is lying.

&gt;The Tarrant campaign has resurrected news stories revealing that Sanders’ wife, Jane O’Meara Sanders — a former professional media buyer — was paid $30,000 for working on Sanders’ 2002 and 2004 House campaigns and his step-daughter, Carina Driscoll, had been paid about $65,000 over a five-year period.

&gt;The Tarrant campaign says the issue is again relevant because this cycle Jane Sanders placed her husband’s first media buy. But this time she received no payment for her services. Sanders has hired Virginia-based Abar Hutton to handle media buys. The firm, which would not comment for this story, was paid for the buy that Jane Sanders made.

&gt;Tarrant’s campaign manager, Tim Lennon, suggested that either Jane Sanders is not the expert Weaver claims or that the Congressman’s campaign is worried that having Jane Sanders on the payroll would look bad.",2015-08-18 15:40:35+00:00,cu74k7u,12.0,t1_cu6yb36,11934.0,Conservative

14889,"&gt;One ruler who consulted the oracle was Croesus, whose kingdom, Lydia,
was located in an area that is now part of the nation of Turkey.
Croesus was worried that his rival, Cyrus of Persia, was a threat to
him, and he sent messengers to Delphi to ask the oracle for guidance.
The oracle said that crossing the river Halys and battling Cyrus would
cause a great empire to be destroyed. Croesus wrongly assumed that the
""great empire"" which would fall would be that of his enemy.

15156,"&gt;President Barack Obama is an Islamist who is intentionally working against the security of the United States, said former Florida Rep. Allen West.

&gt;""The only plausible explanation for many actions taken by President Obama and his administration is that they are working counter to the security of the United States of America,"" the retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel wrote in a post on his website on Wednesday. 

&gt;West cited the president's decision to release five senior Taliban members in the exchange for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl; supplying weapons to support the Egyptian government led by the Muslim Brotherhood; and negotiating with Hamas.

&gt;He also criticized Obama's decision to suspend a ban on Libyans attending U.S. flight schools and studying nuclear science, which had been in place since 1983.

From the link you provided it is tough to disagree with him.  Thanks btw I had not read that it was very interesting!

&gt;[T]he growth of GOP support among white Southerners was steady and mostly gradual from 1928 to 2010, and was a natural outgrowth of the fact that white Southerners were ideologically much more compatible with the national Republican agenda and coalition than with the national Democratic agenda and coalition. What retarded the Southern switch from the Democrats to the GOP was a combination of party loyalties dating back to Reconstruction and the Democrats’ use of racial issues. In other words, if you take race out of the picture, it’s likely that white Southerners would have switched parties earlier and in greater numbers. The real “Southern Strategy” was the one pursued by the Democrats, especially under FDR, to keep conservative white Southerners in a liberal party.

And [consensus doesn't equal truth:](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/344539-i-want-to-pause-here-and-talk-about-this-notion)
&gt;I want to pause here and talk about this notion of consensus, and the rise of what has been called consensus science. I regard consensus science as an extremely pernicious development that ought to be stopped cold in its tracks. Historically, the claim of consensus has been the first refuge of scoundrels; it is a way to avoid debate by claiming that the matter is already settled. Whenever you hear the consensus of scientists agrees on something or other, reach for your wallet, because you’re being had.
&gt;Let’s be clear: the work of science has nothing whatever to do with consensus. Consensus is the business of politics. Science, on the contrary, requires only one investigator who happens to be right, which means that he or she has results that are verifiable by reference to the real world. In science consensus is irrelevant. What is relevant is reproducible results. The greatest scientists in history are great precisely because they broke with the consensus.

Let me ask you a few quesitons... do you think temperature readings from *today* are more or less accurate than those from 50, 75, or 100 years ago?  Do you think a reading from a U.S. Government-run weather station is more or less reliable than, say, one located in an Albanian farmer's field or one run by the Government of Losotho?  [Would you think this heat station](http://www.jgc.org/blog/uploaded_images/rome_italy_airport_weather_station_large2-789953.jpg) produces reliable readings considering it's located right behind the jetwash of airliners taking off all day?

Have you ever heard of the ""island effect"" regarding temperature readings?  Do you know what ""garbage in/garbage out"" means?

What do you think ""scientists"" do when they have unreliable temperature data?

I think what you're missing is an employer not only has to pay higher wages to the employee but also [higher taxes to the state:](http://www.wsrp.com/consider-the-hidden-costs-of-changing-labor-wage-rates/)

&gt;A wage hike increases taxes. The more you pay workers, the more you’ll pay in Social Security, Medicare and unemployment taxes. A pay raise can also affect disability and workers’ compensation insurance costs. Employers need to budget for all these costs, not just higher wages.

The employee doesn't see this money... it goes directly to the Government.

Then I had a one piece leather strap which did look good and was in keeping with the outdoorsy nature of the watch but didn't work unless I was camping or hiking.

I so found this strap (Vera Pelle) on eBay and I think it looks nice (although I wish it were slightly darker).

My deployment clasp is on my Tudor ""Jumbo"" so I went with a generic eBay model.

The Ranger is a substantial watch and this band is nice and thick and holds its shape well.  Fit is good and I think is in keeping with the watch's purpose.  It's a tad too informal to wear with a suit but I have plenty of other options.

Correlation does not imply causation, Sport.  Democrats founded the KKK, they embraced racial segregation, they fought against the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Al Gore's father voted against it), and one could equally say the KKK so repulsed people with their politics that it caused people to vote opposite that organization's interests.

[Scientific Method](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Scientific_Method_3.jpg/400px-Scientific_Method_3.jpg)

Now if we look at this handy little chart we find a section that says ""Develop Testable Predictions.""

Did those predictions end up being true or not?  If your hypothesis is that injecting cyanide into a mammal causes its death... did this occur?  If anybody does this is the result the same?

As I previously stated, I know of no studies whose predictions have had any accuracy.

If you cannot provide reliable, repeatable, and accurate predictions to test your hypothesis then you do not have a scientific fact, you have an unproven hypothesis.

It doesn't really matter how many people say something, it only matters if you have *results*.

Consensus doesn't equal truth and truth doesn't equal consensus.

Are you suggesting that one of the proven, tested foundations of modern science, the scientific method, is wrong?

If so, who is ""anti-science?""

You are simply anti-police regardless of the reason.  Police have the authority - as do many citizens - to use lethal force if they feel their lives or those of others are in jeopardy.

Because you're apparently drawing conclusions from a poorly written article that is not presenting the truth.

If you want to see how ""deadly"" U.S. police are and whether they pose a threat to the average citizen you need to remove all justifiable shootings.

It is the job of the police to stop criminals from commiting crimes.  If a criminal is robbing a liquor store and is shot and killed by a police officer then they are probably doing their job.

If someone is walking their dog and is shot and killed by a police officer they are probably not doing their job.

As quoted from that study, they don't care whether the officer was on duty or not and whether the shooting was justified or not.

Social Conservatives will simply sit the election out.  A whole segment of the population will be ""turned off"" no matter what happens so I don't view that as being a very logical argument.

I'm not sure it *is* un-Constitutional.  In 5-10 years we'll probably have an answer for that but at this time I don't believe we do so that argument is null.

I don't see how these ""resources"" of which you speak are somehow limited.  if people want to donate money to fund lawsuits then that is their right.  There are plenty of people in this country with enough resources to fight more than one battle at a time or to pursue more than one issue at a time.  Again, I see this as being a fallacious argument.

I already stated earlier that if you believe ""marriage"" is the foundation of your society then it makes sense you would favor having the Government getting involved just as if you felt that having access to firearms, free speech, religion, clean water, etc...

Any time a candidate stakes out a position they will alienate a certain segment of the population.  So saying someone shouldn't support something because it will turn off some voters is pretty poor logic.  It is the opposite of the logical fallacy ""Argumentum ad populum.""

Saying that something is a ""waste of resources"" itself doesn't necessarily hold water.  A ""waste of resources"" in comparison to what?  Will not taking that course of action ""save"" resources in the short term but consume more in the future?  Thus that argument, by itself, is pretty poor.  Saying there are ""more pressing issues"" is also a logical fallacy.  This assumes that other people will not focus on these ""more pressing"" issues.  In a nation of 360 million it's possible to have many people focusing on many different issues.

I don't really find any of your ""points"" to be very good.  The one that comes closest to making some sort of sense is regarding ""self reliance"" and Conservatives.
