If you are in disagreement with someone over their support (or lack of) for Donald Trump or anything else it is *not acceptable* to call them a ""CTR shill.""

If you honestly suspect someone *is* being dishonest in their comments, you *may* use the report feature and select ""'Correct the Record' Shill"" and we will investigate.  If you abuse the report 
feature the admins will investigate and take action against your account.

What is happening now is someone will say they aren't voting for Trump and another person will tell them they must be a ""CTR shill"" and the conversation goes downhill from there.

It is not too difficult to tell if someone is being sincere in their comments.  Just ask yourself these questions:

1. Is their account new?
2. Has their account history been deleted?
3. Do they regularly post here?
4. Have they suddenly taking an ""interest"" in politics but only in this sub?
5. Are all their comments rebuttals with links to Leftist websites?

We're not all going to agree on political matters, nor would we no matter *who* is the nominee.  But we *can* interact with one another without resorting to calling one another ""shills.""

This thread is locked because we do not need to have a ""discussion"" about it.

Leftists can have the rest of Reddit to do their thing, but not here.

To that end, any account that doesn't meet our karma or age requirements automatically has *all* of their comments and posts go to spam.

Depending upon the conditions, these requirements are changed.  Moderators may browse through the spam folder and free any comments or posts they think add to the conversation.

Since Bernie Sanders dropped out of the race, we've seen a ten fold explosion of accounts that do not meet our requirements and wind up in spam and we've been having discussions with the admins about this.

For example, we'll find a 5 year old account with barely any karma ""weighing in"" on the Republicans or a 2 year old account who hasn't said much on Reddit defending Hillary Clinton.

If you think your new or low karma account is going to influence discussion here... it's not because it is likely nobody will ever see what you wrote.

If you are a *Conservative* and if you would like us to help you be part of the discussion, [please contact us.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FConservative&amp;subject=Spammed%20Comments)

If you're trying to game the system... well good luck.

Fill out your electoral map and post the response here.

After the dust settles, we'll look at the responses and whomever was the first person with an unedited comment to guess the winner of the 2016 presidential race will win.

The prize will be so valuable you'll be embarrassed to tell anyone what you won (there will be something).

Your response must be in this format:

Trump: XXX Clinton: XXX

Good luck!

This thread will remain open until the end of this month (July).

must have at least 100 link or comment karma at the time of posting.

If you submit your prediction on July 30th and are correct but someone else submitted theirs the day before and they are correct, it is *they* who will win.

We are for *Conservatives* to discuss things with *other Conservatives*.

We're not going away, we're not going private, we're going to continue to grow more every month.

From the comments today, most of the people upset were non-Conservatives.  It was fun to read the knitting circles on the troll and satire subs.

For everyone who took the time to sincerely fill out the questionnaire, thank you.  We will be going through each one and will grant many of you approved submitter status.  

Everything in that questionnaire was written in jest... to be a caricature of what Liberals think Conservatives are.  If you bought it hook, line, and sinker then maybe *you* should look at yourself in the mirror and figure out how you could be so easily duped that this is what Conservatives were being represented as.

Thanks again to all the *Conservatives* who make this subreddit great!

Populists and Socialists are *not* True Conservatives.  To ensure our Conservatives-only membership and to encourage distraction and troll free discussion we will be returning this sub to private status.

Since we used to go private on weekends there will be a substantial number of older accounts that will find themselves able to access our sub and, if you are among the lucky ones, no action will be required by you.

The decision to build a virtual wall around our subreddit will be re-evaluated closer to November 5th.

April 30th will be the last day we will be public.

We have established another subreddit to handle the requests for people looking to gain admittance to the largest Conservative forum on Reddit:

**[You may complete your questionnaire here!](/r/ConservativeRequest/comments/4cref1/please_complete_this_simple_questionnaire_in/)**

 Because we are the largest Conservative forum on Reddit, we are expecting a *huge* response so please get your answers in early so we will have time to review them.

We will - at a later date - be looking to add 2-3 more moderators whose job will be just to review requests and add users as approved submitters.  We will make a future announcement regarding this at a later time.

We will leave this notice stickied for the forseeable future in order to get feedback from those who have any questions or to review comments from people not Conservative enough to make the cut.

As always, /r/Conservatives remains an alternative for those who are not True Conservatives and have gained admittance to the private sub.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q:** What happens if I have not been granted access and visit here after April 30th?

**A:** You will see a notice that this subreddit is private and you will not be able to read or post here.

**Q:** How long will it take for my request to be reviewed?

**A:** We hope within 72 hours although once we have added an additional 2-3 moderators to review requests we hope this will decrease to 24 hours or less.

**Q:** Why are you doing this?

**A:** For many months now we have been receiving, on average, 5 to 10 requests per day asking why Liberals and Trump supporters are allowed to participate here disrupting conversations.  We felt that the time is right to go back to being a private subreddit.

**Q:** What will moderation be like once you're private?

**A:**  Donald Trump supporters will be held to the same standards as other non-conservatives, such as Bernie Sanders supporters.

**Q:** What happens if I don't get access can I fill out the form again?

**A:**  You must wait 30 days and then you can re-submit.  We are going to keep track of everybody's answers and if you try and ""re-take"" the test giving fake answers we'll know.

I'd like to take a little time to make sure we are all on the same page so as to avoid confusion and duplicated efforts.

**We do not allow meta comments or posts here.**

A meta comment or post would be about this subreddit, such as:

&gt;&gt;Why do we only talk about Conservatives in America and not ones in other countries?

Or:

&gt;&gt;It seems like everyone who supports ___________ for president is rude why are they allowed to post here?

The reasoning behind this rule is that posts and discussions should not go off track and turn into a gripe session about this subreddit.  If you want to discuss this sub or anything about it, we have /r/conservativemeta for you or you may [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FConservative).

We also don't allow complaining about other subs being biased because those mods may run their subs the way they see fit... it's none of our business.

If you try to engage in meta discussions here you may have your comments removed and be temporarily or permanently banned.

Don't complain about it later you've been warned and the rules are posted so it's not our fault.

So please, use the other sub (/r/conservativemeta).

We also use Auto Moderator to go through and help us keep things on track.  New users or those with insufficient karma will be flagged and their posts and/or comments will be removed.  The moderators can approve their posts and comments at their discretion.

So if you decide to reach for that Alt or Sock Puppet or create a new account just to make a comment or post, don't bother.  It will not go live and nobody will see it (unless we decide otherwise).

So you're just wasting your time.

Auto Moderator will also not make any self posts live so if you want to make a self post, please [message us first](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FConservative) and let us know so we can look out for it.

But if you make a self post to say you think someone sucks or someone is great... nobody will read it and it will never go live so you're just wasting your time.

Don't waste your time.

The Marine who led the charge up Mount Suribachi to place the first American flag over Iwo Jima in World War II died last week.

First Lt. John Wells died Thursday at the age of 94 at a rehabilitation center in Arvada, Colorado, local ABC affiliate Denver 7 reported. Wells was awarded the Navy Cross, Bronze Star, and Purple Heart for his service in World War II commanding the 3rd Platoon, Easy Co. 28th Marines. Wells led his men in a frontal assault up Mount Suribachi during the Battle of Iwo Jima on Feb. 21, 1945.

While Wells did not make it to the top of the mountain himself—he was shot several times by the Japanese—his leadership resulted in his Marines raising the first American flag above Iwo Jima. The iconic photo of the second American flag being raised was taken hours later.

“By his courageous leadership and indomitable fighting spirit, First Lieutenant Wells contributed materially to the destruction of at least twenty-five Japanese emplacements, and his unwavering devotion to duty was in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service,” Wells’ Navy Cross citation reads.

Wells’ daughter, Connie Schultz, told Denver 7 that the decorated World War II veteran was a true family man who loved the Marine Corps.

“He was a very warm, sensitive, spiritual man all the way to age 94,” Schultz said. “He honored and loved the Marine Corps with all his heart and soul. He loved his family and his last words were, ‘My family.’”

Wells was born in Lakeview, Texas, and attended college at Texas A&amp;M University before joining the Marine Corps. Following World War II, he finished his degree at Texas Tech University and went into the oil business, continuing to serve in the Marine Corps Reserve until 1959.

A funeral will be held for Wells on Saturday in Abilene, Texas, and Reverend Paul Matta, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, and Lt. Gen. (Ret.)

4737,2015-11-11 05:15:07+00:00,self.Conservative,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/3sdgdb/veterans_day/,False,"Recently, at the White House, the following story was told. It happened in Italy, in a time not too long after the end of the Second World War. A father wanted to encourage his young son to do well in school. After the boy got good grades, his dad took him on a journey to Rome. Near the end of their vacation the father said, ""Now we'll have the most important day. I'm going to take you to a sacred place."" He brought the boy to the military cemetery at Anzio, the final resting place of nearly 8,000 American servicemen.

As they stood there among the rows of crosses, the father turned to his son and said, ""Read those names and read those birth and death dates. These are young people, young soldiers who crossed the ocean and came here, and made the extreme last sacrifice to give you freedom and dignity. You owe them everything that is good in your life today. You have to swear here today that you will never, ever forget that you owe them everything you have, and you will always be grateful to their country and to them for what they gave you.""

This is a story told by Silvio Berlusconi, now the Prime Minister of Italy, and the boy in the story is him. All his life he kept his promise to his father, and last month at the White House, he expressed his nation's continuing gratitude to the people of United States.

The America that liberated Europe six decades ago is still an active, hopeful presence in the affairs of mankind. In a world of so many perils, from hunger and disease to political oppression to the spread of deadly technology, America remains the best hope of those who suffer and live in fear. Our cause is liberty, justice, and peace, and millions breathe free today because of American soldiers who fought and sacrificed for that cause.

Many of those heroes rest in places like Anzio and Arlington. Yet so many of them are still with us as friends, as neighbors and colleagues. They are America's veterans, and they are still the pride of our nation. They have fought our wars, defended our shores and kept us free. May God keep us ever grateful for their service.

Thank you very much.
