2,"There it is! That is what I was looking for.

I find myself hunting links to mod rules, mod statuses, SOT updates, etc. frequently. I can never seem to find the reference I want when I want it. Is there something like a mod interests/reference multi? I have no prob finding these kind of references for Reddit, they're right at the bottom of every page, but I get lost hunting these references for the INE.

I'm sure they are right at our finger tips and I'm just suffering from ""Whoosh! syndrome"". Always needing ELI5s for INE stuff.

I know saying ""this"" is frowned on but I've been thinking about ""this"". We have Auto mod to tell us when there is a post here, could an Auto reminder mod/bot be made to give us a list of  subs that have gone a week without posts?

My own situation (personal) has been a mess for quite sometime (illness, injury, preparing to move, BIL in ICU, etc.) but I'm still active and *prefer* focusing on neglected/smaller/new/not yet inducted subs. I love an underdog. I'd love to get a nice list of subs that need a little love in my mail box to use as reference.

I can spend time searching for content or searching for subs that need content but doing both is stretching it. If a bot/mod could give me hints as to which subs need posts it would really help.

44,"""Teala and the Tiny Four Legs"" (part two)

Well, she couldn't just leave it there! After all, she was on shore watch and rescue was her job. She had to rescue the squeaky, little shadow. It was her job... Wasn't it? Yes. She had to help the cute lost Four Legs. It was her *job*.

Only, how? What could she do to help it? The beach wasn't a safe place for the tiny shadow. A wave could lick it up in a breath or a wobbly Two Legs could step on it! No, it could not stay here. She had to take it some place safe.

She wasn't sure how to carry it. If she were to keep her head and the cutie out of the water she needed her hands to help her stay upright. Teala thought for several breaths, looking up and down the beach to keep an eye out for unobserved danger as she did. It would be bad if Two Legs saw her. It would be worse if Shelly or another member of her pod did.

As she looked back and forth her Day Light locks dragged temptingly across the sand. It was too much for the baby Four Legs to resist. With a sudden pounce it was in her hair! She couldn't help but laugh as it's claws and teeth tugged in a totally harmless way. Then it climbed right on top of her head!

This was perfect. It could ride up there. She carefully slid back into the water. Her new companion ""Meee!""-ed more loudly in distress at finding water all around it but held on tighter for just that reason.

Now she knew how to carry it she also had an idea where to take it to be safe. Teala swam towards the pier, barely feeling a hint of guilt, knowing this was how she got stuck with the boring shore watch to start with. Oh, well. If she got caught she would just be stuck with two months of shore watch instead of one. Probably with stink bubble Shelly fuming right beside her so she couldn't slip away again. 

At last she drew close to the sounds and smells of the pier. She could no more resist this place than the lost Four Legs could her hair. As she swam up under the boards she wondered how to deliver her precious ward safely. She had no previous experience with such a delicate land walker. She couldn't just tail flip it. It wasn't as tough nor limp as a half drowned Two Legs.

The smell of the sweet clouds was in her nose. The tiny Four Legs was smelling something else. Warm, greasy tubes of meat wrapped in useless white stuff that only Seagulls were interested in. It ""Meee!""-ed even louder.

Between the boards Teala could see the handsome Two Legs cloud spinner turn towards the sound. If he looked down she would be seen. No Mer could be seen! It was The First Law!

Quickly Teala swam over to the edge of the pier and finned up until the top of her head was just below the boards. Her tiny ward cooperated by hoping right off. Teala slid beneath the waves a half a breath before the cloud spinner turned towards the lost one's hungry chirps.

""Well, hello, little one! Where did you come from? My, what a squeaker you are. Are you hungry? Bet you smell hot dogs. Well, we'll get you one but don't get used to it. You're coming home with me and tomorrow we'll see what my Vet says to feed you. You're too small to eat what my two big kitties eat. I think we'll name you Liquorice.""

As the Two Legs cloud spinner carried the tiny shadow away Teala was sure her ward was safe now. As she swam back to her boring shore watch she couldn't help but wonder, ""What is Liquorice?"" Somehow she was positive it was something sweet.",2016-11-18 07:45:37+00:00,da5eurt,1.0,t3_5djy8w,20000.0,promptoftheday
45,"
""Teala and the Tiny Four Legs"" (part one)

Teala was unhappy. She was assigned to shore watch every night for a full moon phase. Just because her nasty sister had told their Father she had been sneaking up under the pier to watch the Two Legs Bull who made the pink and purple clouds on sticks. 

Now she could not watch the handsome, storm eyed Two Legs make the wonderful, sweet smelling cloud things. She was stuck spending every night watching the worst section of beach, the part where there was nothing but sand and the only Two Legs who came down to the water at night were the ones that stumbled out of the noisy boxes and got sick on the beach.

She would get Shelly back somehow. Maybe she would put Blue Sail Blob sting strings on Shelly's combs. That would teach that stinky whale hind bubble to tattle on her!

She knew she wouldn't. Shelly wasn't that bad... for a whale bubble from the wrong end. Older sisters just did that kind of thing. Sort of their job... but she enjoyed thinking about it. It helped with the boredom.

It *was* boring. Just floating barely high enough so her ears and eyes could work above water. Nothing to do but watch for some wobbly Two Legs to make a mess on the sand, come down to the water to wash off (Ichthy, Ichthy!), and fall in. Just float, stare, and listen for some poor sour mouthed Two Legs to need a few breaths and a tail fling back up on the sand.

Teala was so bored she was thinking about going back down and telling her Father many Two Legs were making the big eye searing flicker thing and much noise on the shore and that it wasn't safe for a young Sea Nymph to watch. By the time Bull Mers got up there to stand watch they would think the Two Legs young had left in the time it took to swim to the beach.

She had already submerged her eyes and started to slip her ears under when she heard the sound. Like a tiny lost porpoise pup calling for it's pod. Teala had never heard that sound before so immediately popped her whole head above the waves to listen.

For many breaths she heard nothing but then it came again. ""Meeeee! Meeee! Meeeeyou!"" As tiny and delicate as the taste of fresh caught mini shrimp. She wanted to know what made that strange and pitiful but adorable call.

She flipped her tail fin a bit faster raising herself higher and pushing herself closer to the sandy shore to see where the sound was coming from. Looking back and forth she saw only sand and the odd, smelly colored shells the Two Legs often left on the beach before they spilled their sunset feed.

Then she saw a small shadow come out from behind one of the big tanks the Two Legs sometimes put the sick making shells into. She couldn't tell what it was from here but she could hear it's sweet chirping call.

After looking up and down the beach, to be sure the coast was clear, she flipped her powerful fin faster and faster to throw herself right onto the sand. As she landed near the tiny curiosity it bounced up and back then froze. She had frightened the poor little thing!

Teala held very still. After a few seconds the small shadow crept forward until the two were nose to nose. As it sniffed at her face she saw that it was a Four Legs. She had never seen one like it. Usually Four Legs were the size of Flounders or even bigger and they said ""Barg, Barg!"" or ""Ip Ayap!"" not ""Meeeeyou!""

The poor little thing was definitely lost from it's pod. No land walker could be so small and do well without it's pod.

77,"It's dark as Hades in your apartment. The thick curtains are tacked all down the outside edges of the window frames so that not even a faint glimmer from the street lights seep in. You sit silently on the sofa, your companion sits on an old, tattered kitchen chair, directly in front of the door, their arms tightly folded across their chest. Although you can't see a thing, you sense that they wear an expression of seething fury and grim anticipation.

The two of you have been waiting in uncomfortable silence for more than three hours. The psychic emanations of your companion's boiling anger have grown so strong that you have become more terrified of drawing their attention, by so much as a single deep breath, than of all of the enemy's weapons, training, and skills combined.

Though the enemy's step is as light as falling autumn leaves, just moments ago you heard the door at the end of the hall  brush faintly over the threadbare carpet announcing the enemy's approach. You cannot change your fate by becoming more still nor by running. You are already as still as death and there is no place left to run. 

You count the seconds, knowing the wait is nearing it's end. It is too late to alter your plan in any way. Either you have found the enemy's one weakness or you will be dead. All options are gone. This is it. The story ends here.

Suddenly the door swings open and slams against the wall. The most high powered rifle ever made is revealed by the pale light from the hall window.

Your enemy freezes, a look of pure horror spreads over their face.  Their harsh, predatory expression instantly changes to an unhinged jaw and a wash of pasty white shock. All of their power is gone in an instant, replaced by an impotent grimace.

Your companion bounds from the chair, charges the few steps forward, grabs your enemy by one ear, and begins to emit loud, high pitched shrieks of rage as they spin your enemy around and haul them out and down the hall.

**""James Mathew Donovan Taylor! What in the name of all that is Holy do you think you are doing!?!** Is this why I read Good Night Moon to you every night for eight straight years? Is this why we sent you to Baptist Academy for eleven years? Six years of Ballet? Five years of piano? Is this why we nearly worked ourselves to death? How could you? What made you think you would get away with wasting all our efforts? Did you think we wouldn't find out? Just wait until your Father hears...""

The outraged screams fade as the hall door closes behind them. My sense of relief is glorious. My triumph is total. The enemy only forgot one thing.

The artist has lyrics from Anaïs Mitchell's ""Wedding Song"" printed below the pic.

""The birds gonna make the wedding bed
And the trees gonna lay the wedding table

Googled them and found the song is from the album [Hadestown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadestown)

188,"Having read all the comments in this thread, and not seeing my personal theory here, I'd like to add my two cents.

IMO, Reddit comments seem to reflect three types or sub-groupings of English.

Modern high effort : Well thought out, carefully worded, carefully punctuated, carefully spaced, modern English. Most of the comments in this thread would come under this heading. Possibly/somewhat provoked by fear of grammar nazis.

Modern rapid and social media driven language drifted English : Popular phrasing and acronyms. Examples of this would include a lot of spoofy, dick butt, le, Pepe, IMO, LMAO, the old Reddit switcharoo, Rick roll, neck beard, etc. Also seems to include the most inside jokes.

Play, junior high school level, or second language : Often prefaced by (cop out) statements such as ""English not my first language"", ""Please forgive formatting, on mobile"", or the dreaded ""Upvote this"". I won't try to give an example but this seems represented in the most relaxed and silliest of chats. 

Modern rapid and social media driven language drifted English and Play, junior high school level, or second language overlap to the point where they might not qualify as separate sub groupings.

When reading posts and comments on Reddit I tend to automatically react to these different language sub-groupings based on which sub/s I find them in.

Please note, I probably should have prefaced this comment with my own cop out ""This may be messy and inarticulate, I just woke up.""

Maybe wait until baby has had all or most of her immunizations, at least?

My family had a simple compromise. We put our too young for real trick or treating kids in pj costumes, knocked on granny's door, let granny oh and aww, and drop a few raisin boxes or other treats in a bag, drove around the block, then went back for coffee and hot cider for the grownups.

Pretend trick or treating and a real short visit covered granny's urge to see baby's first Halloween.

Less spooky to protective parents, healthier for all, and kept granny happy. ",2016-10-19 12:18:39+00:00,d8ymcqu,1.0,t3_589sdr,2671.0,JUSTNOMIL

As to meeting them, bathe and put on clean clothes, shave if you feel you need to, then just forget the physical stuff and have a good time.

You know they are probably just as nervous and hopeful as you, right? Don't focus on yourself, focus on making them feel comfortable and relaxed and it will go just fine.

487,"I'm not on this sub's mod list, if I tried to mod all the INE subs I'd never get any sleep. O.O However, all INE mods support all INE subs... and contribute to as many as we can. I think one thing we all have in common is an insatiable craving for art. It's one of the reasons why we volunteer to mod these wonderful subs.

In my case I love having a constantly changing art gallery on my front page and contact with other art lovers. It's a dream job, even if it is unpaid.

Great list of interests. Have you visited the multi tabs? I think that is your best bet.

Here's a few to visit.

https://www.reddit.com/user/ImaginaryMod/m/imtechnology/#te

https://www.reddit.com/user/ImaginaryMod/m/imcharacters/#ca

https://www.reddit.com/user/ImaginaryMod/m/imfandoms/#fa

The title at the top of each drop down menu (the black bar under the header banner) will link you to the multi for that tab if you click on it.

Also, you may find our NSFW multi tab has some great stuff in it. That is where you'll find the ladies who are a bit more scantily armored. :) (assuming you are eighteen or older)

488,"As an INE mod I post all over all the time. Half the fun is finding great artwork. You should get the karma for your finds. 

Don't think I'm sacrificing by encouraging you to share on other subs instead of snagging the url and x-posting it myself. Not only is x-posting encouraged in the Reddiquette but suggesting other subs to share your finds in (and promoting our subs) is kind of my thing. I'm kind of an INE designated cheer leader/tour guide.

I have no CSS skills (I'm a Granny who loves art but gets lost trying to do anything resembling ""real computer stuff"". LOL) If I'm not making myself useful by sharing our great subs the big mods might *fire* me! LOL Not really but let's not risk it. :D

Again, ty for the x-post.

594,"&gt; not start posting links to slack of OC to upvote.

I'm not on slack so I wouldn't know what happens there but I agree. We shouldn't be pointing out any particular post/s at all.

I wasn't thinking you were accusing me of VM. I just found out a few days ago about FK closing and it really saddens me. I'd hate to see any other sub closed for this kind of thing. 

I think most Redditors familiarize themselves with the rules and I'm always confused by those who break them. If one's posts or comments are being received poorly it just means that either they need to find and share better content, find a sub where their contributions fit better/are more well received, or reconsider the type of comments they are making. 

I see poorly received content as a clue to improve what one is offering. I really don't get the whole VM thing. In my way of seeing it, if you cheat you never get better and never know whether or not you could have. To me, that is just burning yourself.

604,"From the Reddiquette: 

(Please do) ""Vote. If you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it.""

(Please don't) ""Upvote or downvote based just on the person that posted it. Don't upvote or downvote comments and posts just because the poster's username is familiar to you. Make your vote based on the content.""

This is all I am asking. ""Make your vote based on the content."" IE : If it contributes remember to vote for it.

From the content policy: (What constitutes vote cheating or vote manipulation?) ""Asking people to vote up or down certain posts, either on Reddit itself or through social networks, messaging, etc. for personal gain.""

I'm not pointing out a specific user or a specific Post, I'm merely asking people to remember to vote on posts and comments that fit our communities and/or contribute  to conversation.

I know the rules both past and present. I spent eighteen months teaching them, enforcing them, and eating the down votes for doing so as mod in /r/freekarma. I've removed more manipulation posts and comments than most mods do (I think).

Concerning /r/freekarma : After I left the mod team, and was no longer teaching and enforcing the rules, the mods chose to close the sub due to the flood of vote manipulation that took over the sub.

While I was there I worked many hours a day to teach the rules and Reddiquette and prevent vote manipulation.

Admin has access to my full history. They know I made hundreds (If not thousands)of comments to help people learn the rules and warn people against vote manipulation. If challenged, I think I stand on fairly firm ground.

There is no rule against discussing or encouraging voting, which is one goal of this post. ",2016-09-18 00:12:26+00:00,d7r5yz0,2.0,t1_d7qo95o,27790.0,ImaginaryNetwork

643,"&gt;It's just not at all how he meant it and she was purposefully twisting it into an insult.

I think you have that right. I think she put words in hubby's mouth (text) that weren't there to put pressure on him and throw him off balance. Consciously or not she tried to take control of the situation with this little trick.

Is she really this thin skinned? How can you communicate with her and set boundaries if she takes everything said and twists it into a slight? You might want to add how she is putting imagined slights in the way of communications, and how that is making it harder to have real discussions with her, into your next talk with her.

Have you tried writing a FYI out for her? Putting the basics into hard copy she can hold and reread when there is ""confusion"" might help. Some of us older folks need old fashioned, in the hand references.

Simple cut and dried stuff. Kiddo's schedule (wake up time, meal time, nap time, play time, quiet time, bed time), allowed foods, never allowed foods, toys and activities you approve of and those you don't think Kiddo is ready for, checking weather before making outdoor plans, *not making plans without consulting you*, how long in advance plans should be made *and agreed to*, etc. Also might want to give her a list of things Kiddo has shown fear or dislike of. Planning a beach trip for a child who is iffy about water isn't a good idea.

When dealing with a ten year old (the age her personality seems to be frozen at) having the rules visible and in hard copy is a necessity. You need a Granny rule list just like the parents of argumentative kids need a dry erase board, chalk board, or cork board with the rules in plain wording and plain sight.

Sorry you have to deal with this tug of war type relationship. Sending mental hugs. &lt;3",2016-09-16 23:15:06+00:00,d7pxc7c,1.0,t3_534i78,2700.0,JUSTNOMIL

781,"&gt; Or is it like you get to choose? 

Yes, an interest in the sub's subject matter helps. We want our mods to enjoy their work (volunteer/no pay so pleasure is the pay off) and not get bored.

&gt;How involved in the community do you have to be? 

A history of posting and commenting in the sub is a plus. Mods should also be active subscribers. You have that covered in several subs.

&gt;Are there reminders if you are falling behind on posting to one of your subs? 

Because you will (most likely) be modding subs you are already participating in you won't need reminders. You will naturally visit those subs and notice when one hasn't had a recent post. When a sub slows is when it needs a mod post to remind users of that sub.

Also, we have a mod requirements list we will link you to so you can see what is needed/expected.


&gt;And, going by what you've said, signing up is essentially just messaging the mods and asking, right?

Yup. Pretty much. As I have extended the invitation, if you choose subs I'm modded in, I'll be your mentor. (I said I had my eye on you, not just for the INE, for my ""grandbaby""/trainee. *I* want you. ""You have been chosen by the old girl."" :)

No matter which sub you might choose there will always be an experienced mod willing to chat with you/answer your questions. Because our mods live all over the world someone is always awake and available. (So far, so good. :)

&gt;Wussy Music is an amazing name for a sub xD

I think it's great to own your tastes. I think the name ""Wussy Music"" owns up to their tastes. Love that. Part of just being yourself is taking words that start as a slur and giving them a new, and better, meaning. Now we both think of this kind of relaxing music when we see the word wussy.

Neat switch, IMO.

I asked about his brand new PT cruiser. He sat down next to me on the bench and we spent a half hour chatting about cars, life, the universe, etc. Then he shook my hand, thanked me for the visit, and walked into the historic building/art gallery behind me, which he owned. I walked back to my drawing site on Sixth street and went back to busking. At the time I had bright purple hair, was dressed in a multi colored gypsy outfit, wearing too much makeup, and dripping in jewelry.

It took two decades but those women were my only good examples and they *did* give me what I needed to be a decent person. I'm Facebook friends with those who are still alive. They are the only family I let near me.

I hope someday your niece wakes up and finds memories of you have become her shoulder angel. Keep trying. Just because she seems immune to your efforts doesn't mean she is. She is striking out as most teens, especially broken ones, do.

Someday you may get a call or PM that shows you what you did and said stuck. I can't tell those who tried so hard for me how much I love them and how grateful I now am enough.

Some trees take a long time to bear fruit. You may never see it but you are feeding a tree. Wish some of those who tried for me had lived long enough to know they won. Wish I could have told and showed them. I truly love my aunts and sis.

At the time I was too broken to understand what they were trying to do and just plain angry. Later the things they said to me and taught me were in my head and my only guide when I pulled my head out. I would not be the me I am if they had not given my ungrateful, hard headed self the tools they gave me.

Keep trying to give her those tools and love. Even if it seems like she isn't hearing you she is. When she gets older memories of your kindness may be the only guide she has. She won't be an angry broken kid forever.

I only wear makeup on special occasions. I'm just not that kind of girly girl. When I was a young exotic dancer and later as a street performer (chalk murals for tips in the bar district) I wore it all, bras, garter belts, stockings, six inch or taller heels, tons of makeup, glitter, long brightly polished nails, waaay to much jewelry, ect. Now I'm old, have a hubby who likes my looks, with or without cosmetics, and really don't see a need for bras.

My doctors say I'm one of those lucky ladies who do not sag excessively (my breast still just rest against my upper ribs and  stand free of my chest when I raise my arms, despite being 54 and having five grandkids) and just don't need a bra. I wish that sub had been around when I was young and wore them as part of my costumes, it would have been a blessing then, but I no longer want nor need bras.

We had been seeing each other for a couple of months when he asked me to come to his family's shared property, on the reservation, to meet his mom and little sister who lived in the main house and his older brother who worked on another reservation's fish hatchery but was home for a short vacation.

I thought ""Cool, he's getting serious."" I. Had. No. Idea!

I arrived expecting dinner to be in process. It was. A whole dead deer in the middle of the kitchen table, gutted and half skinned. They expected me to help cut it up. I had never butchered anything bigger than a hen. When I turned green they decided to set me to work helping thirteen year old Sis stuff salmon and oil in dozens of mason jars while the ""adults"" cut the deer up.

I did not eat much when dinner was finally served.

A few months later he invited me to spend a two day one night X-mas vacation on the other reservation at the hatchery with his brother. We were supposed to help his brother sort eggs (removed spoiled/mildewed fish eggs from ice cold troughs of running river water). We got snowed in. I picked rotten fish eggs out of ice water for five days while we waited for the plows to clear the roads so we could get out and his brother's hands could get back in. It was at least a week before my fingers would bend normally.

Guess who I later found out planned both of these ""test"" dates?

I moved two thousand miles south shortly thereafter. I like the weather here. No snow.",2016-07-25 01:41:16+00:00,d5pffqb,1.0,t3_4uft31,5795.0,JUSTNOMIL

&gt;The amphibian creatures have lived under the soil for eons; born, hatched, and matured in the perfect conditions.
As they age and become too large for their original burrows they unleash a clutch of their own eggs and travel up to the surface.


&gt;Once upon time they would stay and die in the earth, but this human family has given them reason to emerge.



&gt;As the creatures calcify in the sun, transformed into empty statues, the little girl sets out food and drink for them. A ritual that her family has done for generations.

""What or who is Automod"" (?)

A program/bot that helps mods (Redditors who volunteer to moderate/keep an eye on subs) keep subs clear of spam (sales junk mostly) and other unwanted content (NSFW/porn in non porn subs is a common automod target) . Automod has a basic program which can be added to or altered by mods to help remove unwanted content dependent on each sub's preferred subject/material.

"" what kinds of other things should I post? ""

Depends on each sub. In most subs the subject is obvious from the name or a description can be found in the right sidebar. 

""I'm assuming the little arrows are sort of like ""likes,""

We call them upvotes (arrow pointing up) and downvotes (arrow pointing down.) Some subs replace the arrows with other images but if it's top it ""contributes to the discussion/appropriate content for that sub."" If it's bottom it ""does not contribute to the discussion/appropriate content for that sub."" So you have been doing it right. :)

Subscribing puts a sub's content on your personal front page for easy access.

1266,"The tag was a mistake she incorporated into her costume.

&gt;As for the $1.98 price tag hanging from her hat? The gag got its start when she forgot to remove the tag from the dime-store flowers she put in the hat, and it popped out during an early show; it's said she was embarrassed, but the audience loved the gag so much that it became an essential part of her routine. Colley would later have this to say about that tag: ""The price tag on my hat seems to be symbolic of all human frailty. There's old Minnie Pearl standing on stage in her best dress, telling everyone how proud she is to be there and she's forgotten to take the $1.98 price tag off her hat.""

Now that the post has been removed, the account has been deleted, and you and I are pretty much alone here... You are kidding, aren't you?

I mod NSFW subs and post in them too. Just a little note for future reference... I spent eleven years as a topless dancer and six years as a street performer in the bar district in Austin. I knew what this was as soon as I saw it.

Note my flair. I'm ""Granny"". Playing innocent and naive is a long running joke that started back during the eighteen months I modded /r/freekarma, where a lot of my job was removing hard core porn at four AM.

I've been playing the ditzy granny thing  for almost three years. Sorry if you missed the joke but those who know me  are dying with laughter at this thread.

 Although you don't seem to be losing in one place or on one subject I have a guess. You make a lot of trollish/unpopular statements and don't seem to delete any, even comments with twenty downvotes. It's possible you have gained one or more Downvote Dannys/enemies. If so they could be going through and DVing all your recent comments when they think of you or notice you.

One DV per comment on all comments can add up. You could ask admin to check if you are being DVed by one particular user or you could start deleting unwelcome/controversial comments or you could try being a bit less mean/a bit nicer. 

You don't seem to be familiar with the first rule of Reddiquette :

&gt;Remember the human. When you communicate online, all you see is a computer screen. When talking to someone you might want to ask yourself ""Would I say it to the person's face?"" or ""Would I get jumped if I said this to a buddy?""

A few things she pulled.

Told my young hubby it was his duty to his family to break my will by beating me... so I would submit to *HER* authority. (We did not live in her house, we had our own.)

Convinced my doctor to take my newborn out of the incubator so she could hold him before I was allowed to.

Told hubby that as soon as I carried anything into his house it became his legal property (which is how the money my mom sent me for baby clothes, the x-mas gifts my mom sent, my curling iron and blow dryer, about half my jewelry, and a goodly portion of my WIC groceries wound up in her and her sister's hands.)

Had hubby kidnap me and my newborn and bring us to that party.

Prevented me from attending church because I refused to convert to her religion (Mormonism).

Prevented me from finishing high school.

Arranged for hubby to go on dates with other (Mormon) girls while we were married.

Convinced my hubby to live in her house, with her, three days and nights a week.

Provided my hubby with pornography *so he could see the right way to have sex*. O.o

Convinced hubby holding hands with me or kissing me would give him herpes (never had it).

We were very young. I was seventeen, he was eighteen. A few years ago he sent me a friend request on Facebook. Out of curiosity I accepted. To my amazement he publicly apologized and admitted everything. For our son's sake.

He grew up. We occasionally chat. Time heals.

I lurk here because I've been there and sometimes it still hurts, even after so long. I'm blessed with a MIL who thinks I'm the best thing to ever happen to her son. A good woman.

&gt;What's the purpose of vote manipulation?

Cheating for no apparent reason.

&gt;And what is the purpose of collecting huge numbers of votes?

Granny's third most often cut and paste comment :


A simplified statement explaining Karma points value : ""They are kind of like brownie points. They have no value except as a gauge for how interesting or entertaining your posts and comments are. Like bragging rights but you aren't really supposed to brag. You know the song The train they call the city of New Orleans? A line from the song says ""A penny a point, ain't no one keeping score"". It's like that. Just for funzies. LOL""


If you aren't having trouble with posting limits, the only reason I know of to collect Karma is to buffer your account so if you have controversial opinions and want to make comments or posts that might result in a downvote landslide you don't wind up with negative Karma. Kind of a Karma bank.

3624,"No apologies necessary. This sub gets a lot of help requests due to the name. I sometimes reply when I have an idea where to look. I'm telling you what I've seen others told.

 Just go over to /r/Assistance and start clicking on the colored tabs in the sidebar, *read everything*. They have had problems with false requests so their rules are very specific. I think you have to fill out a simple registration form before posting too. After you read it all make a new post there. Also helps to read other request posts there to see how it's commonly done. Best case, you get help there. Worst case, you don't. If you are out of work it is worth the time and effort.

You can also type ""emergency assistance"" and your town's name into Google. Lot of local assistance programs in most towns.

Might try Googling ""veterans assistance"" too. The more places you contact the better your chance of finding help.

3848,"&gt;. I should focus on things that are actually worthwhile, like school, jobs, or forming healthy relationships with GOOD people.

Read this over and over and over until you have embedded it in your heart and mind.

You didn't have a bad high. *You woke up!*

You know what is wrong. You have been hanging with the wrong folks, doing the wrong things, making the wrong choices. You have been pushing the good people away. You have been living a bad dream. You are awake now. *Don't fall back to sleep.*

*Listen to your heart. You are a good person with good thoughts. You can start over clean and fresh.*

Stop wasting the wonderful you on users who don't love you. Stop wasting your chances on escape.

Read this whole post over and over so you remember.

When your life is good again you may be able to smoke again but not now. Now what you need is to talk to good people who care. Talk to your folks. You don't have to tell them everything but you can tell them a guy used you and hurt you and that you are having trouble with depression.

You can also tell them how much you love and cherish them. It will help. So would going to see a councilor and talking it out. You have been swallowing all this pain and that is the worst thing you can do with pain.

You are facing the same reality as many young people living on their own for the first time. You got carried away with having fun that wasn't really fun. Now you are awake and know the truth.

Time to learn to love yourself. You deserve that. You also deserve to have others love you so open the door and let the good people back into your life.

Good luck! &lt;3",2015-12-19 06:42:39+00:00,cy4ad6v,1.0,t3_3xftby,1519.0,trees

From the Wikipedia  link in my other comment:

&gt;The male seahorse is equipped with a pouch on the ventral, or front-facing, side of the tail. When mating, the female seahorse deposits up to 1,500 eggs in the male's pouch. The male carries the eggs for 9 to 45 days until the seahorses emerge fully developed, but very small. Once the young are released into the water, the male's role is done and he offers no further care and often mates again within hours or days during the breeding season.

He just caries the eggs and hatched young in a pouch and releases them when they are fully developed.",2015-12-10 00:08:09+00:00,cxthll4,2.0,t1_cxthffd,277.0,MarineBiologyGifs

I make subs because I like to see them used. /u/VALAR_M0RGHUL1S and our other mods are using the sub and have put effort into promoting it.

 It seems like a good sub for multi subject pics. I'm seeing a lot of pics with people, animals, and structures in our landscape subs. Sometimes the landscapes are secondary subjects in the pics and kind of get cluttered out. This sub gives a place for some of those cluttered pics. It's a good sub for keeping busy motifs out of more simple subject subs or for clarifying that the pics are more about man made subjects than nature when a pic is x-posted from there.

The free in /r/freekarma stands for our allowing content other subs do not allow, such as blatant reposts (even straight from front page), GIFs, memes, off topic chats, up to four posts per day per user, new user/low karma account posts and comments, BOT posts and comments, etc.


We support the rules of Reddit, as all subs are required to do.
We do not allow vote manipulation comments nor posts. Ninety percent of my job is removing them. :(


See the sticky post ""Why do my posts and comments keep disappearing?"" or ""What is vote manipulation?"" at the top of our page. The rule is clearly posted and enforced.

All subs are required to comply with Reddit's content policy.


The free in /r/freekarma stands for our allowing content other subs do not allow, such as blatant reposts (even straight from front page), GIFs, memes, off topic chats, up to four posts per day per user, new user/low karma account posts and comments, BOT posts and comments, etc.

We support the rules of Reddit, as all subs are required to do.
We do not allow vote manipulation comments nor posts. Ninety percent of my job is removing them. :(

See the sticky post ""Why do my posts and comments keep disappearing?"" or ""What is vote manipulation?"" at the top of our page. **The rule is clearly posted and enforced.**

Sorry. You can make a new post but read our sidebar rules and the Reddit content rules first, please. We do allow mistakes and second tries.

4881,"Thanks for the sub mention but I'd like to add that all subs are required to comply with Reddit's content policy.

The free in /r/freekarma stands for our allowing content other subs do not allow, such as blatant reposts (even straight from front page), GIFs, memes, off topic chats, up to four posts per day per user, new user/low karma account posts and comments, BOT posts and comments, etc. for the purpose of new users learning, practicing, and, to a certain extent, playing.


We support the rules of Reddit, as all subs are required to do.
We do not allow vote manipulation comments nor posts. Ninety percent of my job is removing them. :(


This new Redditor should see our sticky post ""Why do my posts and comments keep disappearing?"" or ""What is vote manipulation?"" at the top of our page. The rule is clearly posted and enforced.

Even /r/freekarma supports [Reddit's content policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) and all users should read it before posting or commenting... in any sub.

Thanks again for the sub mention.

4962,"&gt;  If you delete a post does it remove all karma (positive and negative) associated with that deleted comment from your karma total? 

No. Once a vote has been added or subtracted from your stats it stands.

Also, if a comment or post has one or two downvotes it can come back. I had a -2 rebound to a +14 a few days ago so don't delete until it is obvious your comment or post is universally disliked/considered non relevant. Give it a few hours unless it is dropping fast. Sometimes the first people to vote are trolls or other commenters or posters who downvote to eliminate the competition. Rude but it happens.

Fully agree.

&gt;Plus we can make it NSotW when it gets inducted which will bring in a decent amount and if we're lucky it could go trending then.

If.

Isn't the minimum 200 subscribers? Can't count our Path Walkers before they subscribe.

There are a **lot** of promo subs in the multi in the sticky post in HCVOS. For now, just what we've already mentioned but I'll do more over the next few days. Lot of places to promote.

Correct. We remove them if we spot them. We are a bit behind so probably have missed some but we are working on it.

Please, if you can find a recording of this inarguably great rain sounds, that does not have ads attached, post it. I really liked the sounds, just not the ad.

&gt;But before too long, the strain of migrating anywhere from hundreds to thousands of kilometers, breeding, defending territories and redds, and chasing off competing fish, all without eating, begins to take its toll. During spawning, salmon put all of their energy into breeding. All the normal things that we do on a day-to-day basis to stay alive (eating, for example), and all the things our bodies do to keep us healthy (fight off infections, destroy damaged cells, etc.) salmon neglect in favor of procreation. In fact, by the time salmon reach their spawning grounds, they’ve already begun the descent to senescence. The salmon start rotting before they’ve even died.

I'd like to remind my fellow plant lovers to check times on correct answers. If two answers have the same hour tag hover your curser over the time to see which answer came first before voting. If two answers came within minutes of each other/simultaneously consider them to both be first correct response (they may have spent extra seconds/minutes checking their info and that is a good thing) and vote accordingly.

I've lost count of how many late/second responses have gone to top comment with several minutes between the two comments.

First correct answer should get the love and be top comment.

* item 1 : Create your own sub.

* item 2 : Adopt a deserted sub.

* item 3 : Message the mods of your favorite sub and politely ask if they will consider adding you as a mod.

Note : Most sub's mod teams will only consider a Redditor for their team who actively participates in the sub by posting and commenting, whose account has been open a certain amount of time, who is friendly and respectful to other Redditors, and who has a good Karma balance.

Also, if the mod team has sufficient members to cover the work load they may put you on a waiting list until the sub gains more users or has higher traffic.

From the Wikipedia section on reproduction :

&gt; The way that their ovipositor is formed relates to its functional adaptability in the areas which it lays eggs. The ovipositor is an organ used by insects for laying of eggs. It consists of a maximum of three pairs of appendages formed to transmit the egg, to prepare a place for it, and place it properly. Tettigoniids have either sickle-shaped ovipositors which typically lay eggs in dead or living plant matter, or uniform elongate ovipositors which lay eggs in grass stems.

Jake went back in the shop to sell a late rising customer a cup of coffee and a new package of hooks while Jigs hauled the heavy prize down to the gutting table. It took little time to clean the big beast. As he scraped the shed scales and bits of refuse into the scrap bucket he noticed movement in the nearby tangle of seaweed. Leaving his catch resting on the weathered pine slat table he cautiously and softly stepped down the sand to see what had made the ripple.



At first he thought it was just an otter gazing up from the lose floating bull kelp but long waving tendrils of silvery hair and the shinning, long lashed gaze could not possibly be an animal. He wondered if he had gone instantly senile as the beautiful green eyes blinked up at him. In disbelief he turned and walked back to his catch. Standing with his back to the impossible he gulped the now bright sun lit morning air.



After he had settled his pounding heart he bent to pick up the tub of still living, unused shiners. He walked nervously back to the waters edge, hoping he would see some normal thing, otter or maybe a seal.



Again, the strange over large eyes blinked up from the low rolling waters. There was no doubt. It was a mermaid. He might be crazy but there was nothing wrong with his eyes. Bending down slowly he floated the bait tub in the cold Pacific waters, nudging it so it floated out the few feet towards the living myth.



An obviously human but web fingered hand quickly grabbed the tub and with a flip of an iridescent tail almost too fast for his eyes to follow, she was gone.



It would be a long day of simple chores, cutting, freezing, and cooking his ocean treasure but he would have plenty to think about.



It had been a perfect morning and he was well pleased.",2015-09-13 05:17:15+00:00,cuzreii,1.0,t3_3kpfa2,30409.0,promptoftheday
6256,"Jigs had always loved the cool hours just before sunrise. Now days he was having a harder start than in earlier years. Age had made him stiff and creaky but he still loved those quiet hours when it seemed he was the only one on the planet. He looked forward to his walk to the pier in the misty puddles of glow cast by his neighbor's porch lights.

He pulled his old dock shoes on and made his way down to the kitchen. As he pushed the squeaky swinging door open the smell of coffee that had been tickling his nose became that wonder of morning, the full blown smell of mountain grown wakefulness. He sighed a big gulp of the nutty rich scent in and reached for his cup, glad his oldest, and the fine man she had married, had given him the automatic percolator two Christmases ago. So nice to have that rich steamy brew waiting for him when he came down, at least when he remembered to set it up the night before.

He soon had bacon and eggs going in the pan and the toast popped up just as he slid his greasily delicious breakfast onto the plate. Everything was timing out perfect today. No scorched whites nor underdone, too chewy pork. The bacon was crisp, the eggs were just right, and he had his sister Cat's summer fig jam to sweeten up the buttery whole grain toast. Doc wouldn't let him have white bread anymore. Slowed his digestion and made him cranky. He didn't really miss it. The crunchy bits of odd grains, sunflower seeds, and walnuts were tasty, as long as none of the bits got under his denture. That was a mild pain he could do without.

He was feeling lazy so he set the plate and fork in the sink and ran a little warm water on them to keep the smears of yolk from setting up. Dishes could sit. The barometer outside the window said the fish were waiting. He poured the last of the rich black coffee into his old travel mug, grabbed his lunch bag out of the fridge, and pulled his well worn, flannel lined jean jacket on.

As he stepped out the door the chill, damp darkness sent a tiny but kind of pleasant shiver down his spine as he stuck his shoe in the door to keep it from locking while he checked to see if his keys were in his pocket. They were and the door closed with a decisive click as he pulled his shoe out of the jamb.

The walk to the pier was pure pleasure. All was still and nearly silent, only marred by the soft distant rumble of trucks on the interstate starting the hauls, both long and short, to bring all manner of necessities and luxuries to towns and cities around the country. The sound of condensed mist dripping from the eves, overhead wires, clothes lines, and branches almost drowning out the faint sound of those hard working truckers starting their day.

The weight of his battered tackle box and favorite rod were no burden but a comfort, like the hand of an old friend in his.The slightest breeze graced the air with the tang of salt and sea weed. He wanted to get to the pier before the first light of the new day broached the horizon. The fish always bit best at the crack of dawn this time of year and he was hoping to earn his own dinner with patience and a bit of delicate twitching of the new line he had strung his reel with yesterday afternoon. He could almost taste the baked Cod or maybe Flounder. He had two perfect lemons and a fresh clove of garlic, straight out of his own garden, waiting in the chipped mixing bowl on the counter.

He stepped carefully onto the salt slick boards of the community dock, wouldn't do to slip. His brother had fallen on a mossy cobble in his own drive and busted his hip not a year before. Mike just wasn't the same. Spent his days hunkered down in a beat up easy boy in front of the T.V. Said he just wasn't up to fishing or even the long drives along the fern and redwood lined logging and National park roads that had been their shared pleasure since Jigs had gotten his first license and junker jeep so many, many summers before. 

It was strange his baby brother now seemed older than himself. Watching age and infirmity set it's teeth in his life long companion had made him a great deal more cautious with his own body. He wasn't ready for the recliner and rather hoped he could skip that stage of life.

He made his way to his favorite bench, one of three left since El Niño had taken the three others in an out of season storm last month. The Town Council had decided to wait until spring to replace the benches. The early fall fogs and rains had driven the tourists into the restaurants and malls in the cities down the coast. The few shore loving locals could settle for the remaining benches. Those few fellows who fished there in the mornings, the two or three young mothers who strolled down with their newest babes in carriages to escape the daily unending chores for a few minutes, and Miz Lorelai, who filled canvas after canvas with foaming waves and arching seagull wings, she sometimes sold at the flea market and County fair, were seldom all there at the same time so three benches would do fine for now.

He peeled the air hole pierced lid off the tub of shiners and carefully slid the hook through the silvery bottom jaw of one of the tiny fish so the tip barely protruded through it's upper lip. He didn't much enjoy using live bait but the fish would seldom bite on artificial lures nor salmon eggs this late in the season.

He cast the line out in a perfect whirring arc. As long as he'd been fishing he seldom flubbed a cast but it was always nice to make a smooth flip on the first try. The tiny plop of the float hitting the water sent a single delicate echo reflecting off the bait shop where Jake had just flipped on the lights.

He tucked the butt of his pole firmly against his thigh and leaned back to wait and, occasionally, just slightly twitch the line. He was in no hurry to see the red and white bob dip and bounce. It would be a long day and nothing waited back at the house except his breakfast dishes and weeding. No hurry at all.

He sat , moving only to draw sweet predawn breaths of Pacific glory into his lungs. Time passed and it began to get light but the bobber moved only in synchrony with the placid waves. The first sliver of sun peeked over the hills behind him and still he waited. Usually his first strike snagged the hook sooner than this and he was beginning to think he should have set one of the hens his nephew had butchered out to thaw. He could run by the Piggly Wiggly for a couple of Elgin Sausages, they'd be tasty along side a hand full or two of fresh picked, late summer green beans and a baked potato but he really had his mouth set for fish. Even smoked sausage would taste a tiny bit of disappointment if he didn't take a fish. 

At last, and suddenly (no matter how long you had waited the strike was always sudden) the bobber blooped beneath the surface and popped back up for only a moment before his hoped for meal pulled it under and ran with it. He let the reel spin, allowing a good length of line to run out. No need to jerk the line to set the hook. It was obvious that it was a big boy and had gulped the bait whole.

He knew just how deep the bottom was here. He had watched the work men build the pier and judged the moment before his prey could slide under submerged debris with long earned skill. Locking the reel, to prevent more line from hissing out, he began to work his unknown opponent in, cranking a little at a time and tilting the pole tip so , what he could tell by the strain was a good sized fish, could not snap the tip.

At last the sharp snout of a good large salmon broke the surface and moments later was gasping on the dock. A better dinner than he had hoped for, and several meals to come, was embodied in the exhausted Chinook at his feet. The fish was at least twenty pounds, before gutting, and the straight bill showed it had not reached breeding age. The lack of hook to it's beak told him it's meat would be fresh and delicious.

Sliding his fingers behind its gills he carried his kit and the heavy fish to the weighing stand to the side of the bait shop. Jake stepped out and admired the beauty as the scale revealed the ocean had provided Jigs with twenty three pounds of protein, bought at only the expense of his yearly license, a tub of shiners. and a bit more than an hour of his time.

6303,"As she set the last, fresh washed pan in the drain rack she glanced out the window over the sink. She was surprised to see the chickens had gone to roost despite the perfectly clear skies and it only being a bit after three in the afternoon. Not a good sign when added to the weather man having said it might storm tonight.

The boy's shift at the mine finished at two. She was worried that they weren't home yet but she guessed they'd stopped off at Hilliard's for a beer or two. It was payday Friday after all.

She hung her damp apron on the back of the door and headed out to bring the wash in off the line. It had been still and hot all day and she figured it was dry even though she'd just put it out an hour ago. She grabbed the basket off the machine and walked across the brittle, Summer burnt back lawn.

She gave the last sheet a smart snap to flick away any dust that might have settled, folded it, and laid it on the stack. As soon as she set the basket on her great Grandmother's old cedar trunk at the foot of the bed she went back in the kitchen and grabbed the old straw basket off the fridge. She went out to the coop and shifted the seven hens, the only ones who would still lay in the heat, off the nests. She only found two eggs. The basket was not needed. The girls had been dropping five or six eggs each morning and at least four during the day. The sudden drop in laying worried her too. 

They needed the eggs and if the girls didn't start laying Jim was going to start talking about chicken and dumplings. She liked this year's hens and wasn't ready to put them in the freezer. She knew she shouldn't get attached but most days the cheerful clucking reds and tiny, temperamental Banties were all the company she had.

She washed the two eggs and put them in the fridge. Looking out the window again she saw a few pure white clouds slipping over the mountains. She decided to focus on getting diner ready and tried to brush off the bad feeling. 

Soon she had the chops sizzling and the potatoes boiling. It didn't help. It was after four, the boys weren't home yet, and the lump of worry had settled in for a good long visit. She slid the covered pans into the stove to keep warm and went into the sitting room.

She turned on the T.V. set and settled on the comfortably saggy sofa. She wanted the weather but the local station wouldn't run the news for another forty minutes. She could have gotten the report every half hour if Abe hadn't taken her radio fishing and knocked it into Lake Powell the month before. Needed to get a new one but bills came first.

She just couldn't focus on the glitzy game shows that were all that were broadcast at this hour. She got up and went to look out the front door every few minutes. There was no sign of the boys and the thermometer on the front porch showed the temperature was dropping fast. She really wished Jim and their sons would get in.

She could have called the bar to check on them but boys needed room to be boys. She was neither the type of wife nor mom who kept her men under thumb. You didn't make men that way. You just made your sons and husband strain against that kind of leash... but she was getting awfully worried.

At five the news came on and she wasn't surprised to see the camera went straight to the weather man. He said it had started to snow up in the pass and warned viewers to bring their pets and kids in. He said it could move down the mountain and if it did there could be quite a lot of snow.

When the news moved on to local interest she turned the set off. She couldn't sit still so she got the vacuum out and started to run it over the thread bare carpet. She got to thinking she couldn't hear the phone over the old Eureka vacuum so she finished quick and not too thorough and put it back in the closet.

It was close to six and they still weren't home. She wasn't fooling herself. She was worried sick and she started to wonder if she should drive to town to see if Jim's old pickup had blown a tire or broke down on the way home. If they just got wrapped up shooting the breeze over beers with some of the guys from the mine she didn't want to spoil their fun. All three worked hard and deserved a night out every now and then.

Finally the worry was too much so she went into the bedroom, slipped off her house dress, and pulled on her warmest sweater and jeans. The temperature had dropped from ninety six to fifty eight and was still going down. She got her coat out of the closet and scooped her keys out of the chipped Delft dish on the table by the door.

Her old Belair station wagon hadn't been started since church last Sunday and tended to be hard to start when it was cold out. She was pleased it turned right over. The cold must not have had time to seep into the sun heated engine.

As she pulled out of the drive she saw the first fluffy flakes of dry, bitterly cold snow drift down and slide off the sides of the windshield. She shivered, not from the cold. The winter coat Jim gave her for her last birthday was plenty warm. Abe had just turned eighteen that June and worry for her youngest chick sent a bitter line of Mother panic down her spine.

Jim and the boys had chipped in to get her new retreads for Christmas so she wasn't worried about traction. None the less as she turned out onto the one lane road she was glad the first six miles were graveled.

 The snow was melting as fast as it touched the still hot gravel and turning it to hot slushy mud where the gravel had washed off during the spring rains. The County kept promising to black top it but they'd lived here since two years after they married and it was still just badly potholed gravel.

She drove slow until she got to the turn off to Old Huntington Highway. She saw no sign of fresh tire tracks along the road despite leaning so far forward to stare out the shield that her breath fogged it. The defroster was too old to deal with her nervous breaths and she had to find an old rag in the glove box to keep wiping the glass.

She was almost to the new over pass when she saw the skid marks and the torn, snow brushed, grassy edge running into the shallow ravine. She let her foot off the gas and tapped the brakes gently several times. Wouldn't do to put the station wagon off the road too.

She yanked the emergency brake and dove out the door. Running over to the edge she looked down to see Jim's truck no more than a dozen feet down, hung up on a rock out cropping. The windows were fogged and she couldn't see in.

""Jim! Junior! Abe!"" she yelled, cupping her hands around her mouth to carry the sound. For a moment nothing happened and her heart crawled up and tried to strangle her.

The truck door popped open and Jim waved and called, ""Deer ran out in front of us. Busted the back axle! Dang good to see you, Hon!""

Ten minutes later she slid over and Jim took the wheel. Both boys tossed their lunch kits in the back and climbed in. She didn't have to tell them to buckle up. They were still a bit shook up and put their belts on without so much as a look from her.

Two hours later, with her good mashed potatoes and slightly dried out chops in their bellies, all three of her men dozed off in the living room. Usually she would wake them and send them off to bed. Not tonight.

Tonight she just wanted to watch them doze and hear their soft snores. Her men were home.

For me to stand on one foot on one scute the scute would have to accommodate a size seven and a half (U.S.) shoe, or I could stand on the tip toes of one foot which would only require a scute about four inches by two inches.

Of course, as we are discussing a mobile World Turtle, I think I'd feel safer and more comfortable with both feet braced on the scute about eighteen inches apart so, maybe thirty inches by eighteen?

Type #1 : Programs used by Admins and mods to keep Reddit functioning and enforce the rules. Examples of these hard working bots include spam filters, automod, and other working bot programs.

Type #2 : Programs written by Reditors which have their own accounts and fulfill various functions such as adding content (posting) in new subs until the sub has a nice selection of content to attract subscribers, commenting on posts, notifying users when a post has been linked to a second sub, providing shortened Wikipedia link info for the lazy, recognizing and commenting on specific words and phrases, etc.

6717,"That depends on which Spam filter strength that particular sub's mods have chosen in ""Settings"". 

The spam filter strength options are :


&gt;'high' is the standard filter, 'low' disables most filtering, 'all' will filter every post initially and they will need to be approved manually (by a Mod) to be visible.

Subs often use Automoderator to filter posts as well. If a sub is using Automoderator the mods can set it to remove many different things such as new users, specific words or phrases, videos, GIfs, specific content sources, etc.

If you want to know how a sub's filters are set or about the sub's Automod (often listed in the sub's mod list ) you can message that sub's mods and *politely* ask via the ""Message the Moderators"" link in the sub's sidebar, usually found just above the mod list.

Always be polite in messages to Mods, never bite the hand that approves your post.

All Mods are just regular Redditors who volunteer to moderate one or more subs on Reddit. (Except those Admins who Mod subs they are interested in or enjoy. Many, if not most,  Admins are Redditors too.) When we contact mods of subs we are not mods in we try to be very polite too. It just makes things work better and is more social. This *is* Social Media. :)

/r/FreeKarma's comment filter is set on low to give new users a place to learn, practice, and play.

6719,"&gt;What is an Internet troll?

According to the Wikipedia :

&gt; In Internet slang, a troll (/ˈtroʊl/, /ˈtrɒl/) is a person who sows discord on the Internet by starting arguments or upsetting people, by posting inflammatory, extraneous, or **off-topic messages in an online community** (such as a newsgroup, forum, chat room, or blog) with the deliberate intent of provoking readers into an emotional response or of otherwise disrupting normal on-topic discussion.

Source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_troll

___

It is important to remember Trolls thrive on the petty sadism of causing others discomfort or irritation.

From the Wikipedia entry : 

&gt;The advice to ignore rather than engage with a troll is sometimes phrased as ""Please do not feed the trolls.""

Take a look at my comment stats. About a year and a half ago I decided to try ""just trying really hard to be plain old fashioned nice"". I swear to you, that is where most of my comment karma comes from. I lose a lot of points to people who don't like my mod messages. This is my only account but I'm still gaining daily despite the ""mod price"" in fifty subs. (Nice folks get a **LOT** of mod invites.)

If I can grow my karma by saying honestly nice things like ""I like that pic, thanks for sharing."", ""I love that song, it cheers me up. TY"", ""Thanks for the giggle. Hope you are having a great day!"", etc. so can you.

6849,"In ""the old days"" a book was read, an inscription, often a personal review by the first and following owner/s, was written on the blank pages, and the book was regifted or sold.

This was a common practice and these inscription pages were often  added to by each consecutive owner. Many older books have dozens of the previous owners comments filling all the blank pages and, some times, the margins as well.

Example : http://www.alibris.com/glossary/inscription

I collect antique romance novels, the ones that end with the first kiss, and many of my books contain reviews/inscriptions by previous owners.

/u/CyclingMonkey is partly right about these blank pages but no publisher would waste that much paper, which could be trimmed and sold for pulp there by reducing costs, if it were not traditional to leave blank pages for this purpose. Many modern publishers have done away with the blank pages because writing an essay on books you have read has gone out of style.

7321,"Back when we lived in the country our neighbor had a rooster who reached true maturity. It had huge spurs, full wattles, and must have been as big as a domestic turkey. About two and a half to three feet tall. **HUGE!**

 After it tried to kill their German shepherd he threw it over the fence into the woods behind our house. He later said he thought it would starve or the coyotes would get it. I guess he did not realize woodlands were it's natural environment. O.o

It became my constant companion. It would follow me all over the property. (My cats were too fast for it, thankfully.) It watched my every move from about fifteen feet away but never tried to hurt me.

I had planted foxglove and nursed it along until it was finally forming buds. They take quite a while to reach that stage, especially in Texas' dry weather. I woke one morning, just before they should have bloomed, to find that crazy SOB had dug up and **eaten** all twelve plants.

It was the final straw. I told the neighbor to get his monster off our land. The men spent several days trying to catch it. There were injuries. Finally it died due to a shotgun blast. He buried it. Between toughness and the unknown effect of having eaten twelve digitalis plants no one had any interest in cooking nor eating it.

I'm a lucky old girl. Both lead and second agreed on me. They invited me to join the mod team on my cake day. Best cake day ever!!!!

That is nice of you to say but remember, Mods are just regular users who volunteer to run the subs so we can all enjoy them. We aren't perfect, we are just Redditors who work for free. Some are great people with big hearts, some are a bit more human.

I'm quite glad I don't know who the over reporter is. I might have some very unpleasant words for them. I give my time willingly but this person is ~~stealing~~ wasting my and other mods time. :(",2015-06-20 03:30:44+00:00,csclb1q,4.0,t1_cscl1w5,607.0,FreeKarma
