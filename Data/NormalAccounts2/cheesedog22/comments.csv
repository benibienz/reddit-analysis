2,Have you thought about putting your music on a site like Soundcloud or Bandcamp?  Those work even better than Youtube or Myspace and there's a pretty great community on there. ,2016-01-23 19:46:24+00:00,cz97wys,1,t3_42arw8,23931,AMA
3,"It's kind of just cooking common sense that a bird over maybe 14 pounds is going to get dried on the outside before the inside is safely cooked, it's an enormous amount of animal.

But if you're craving a source I definitely remember Alton Brown explaining this in one of the Good Eats Thanksgiving specials. ",2015-11-23 17:41:55+00:00,cxabxg0,3,t1_cx7xu59,187912,AdviceAnimals
4,"Explanation: The larger a turkey gets the more of its weight is actually just taken up by bone (which grow exponentially larger), so you're getting significantly more meat with two 12-pound turkeys than a single 24-pound. 

Secondly, cooking a 24-pound turkey safely all the way through will result in a dried out bird compared to cooking to smaller birds which can get cooked through while the outside is still tender.

tl;dr: 2 smaller birds = better quality meat and more of it!",2015-11-17 23:31:30+00:00,cx3w8kl,1,t3_3t82dy,224,AdviceAnimals

Thanks for doing this, big fan. Obviously this is kind of a subjective question and it varies from person to person, but could you try to explain what a piano actually is? ",2015-09-10 19:40:39+00:00,cux3aqc,1,t3_3kflto,5638,IAmA
8,"Hey journalist here. 

I don't really want to say where I work/worked. But I can confirm that very few critics/journalists have actual copies of this if any. I asked for my promo a few weeks ago and was told that I could listen to Currents, but I had to come by the PR office and they'd let me listen to it there. 

What I can say is that this is one of the most seriously protected records I've encountered.  I have promos for big albums that aren't out until nearly the beginning of September, but Currents has been really tough to get a hold of.",2015-06-19 23:30:47+00:00,cscep46,1,t3_3acy6g,75647,TameImpala
