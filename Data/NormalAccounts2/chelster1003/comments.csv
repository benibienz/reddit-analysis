  Yeah, I know, that's what I meant when I wrote that it's probably not the most fitting description. I'm also not trying to bash on the guys at Valve. I just think that it's really surprising a bug like this exists, especially considering that it's one of the most (if not the most) important parts of the game.

61,"German aswell, can confirm what most Germans in here said. At one point in time I felt like it was too much tho, since history has so much more to offer I would've loved to learn about.  Nonetheless, I also felt like it was very important to learn about the decisions our ancestors made. 

  Racism and nationalism and all that shit have never been topics for me. I grew up in a very multicultural environment, my best friends to this day are two guys from kindergarden, one of greek and one of turkish descent. When going to school after kindergarden, there were even more people from all over the world and a few of them are still friends of mine to this day. If I'd have to take a guess, I'd say about 50% of all kids in my class were of foreign descent and at the time, it really didn't matter where you were from. Friends, that's all we were. That's ofcourse slighty off topic, but it's important (atleast for me it has always been) to understand how I felt learning about all the horrible things our ancestors did. 
  
  The weird part for me was when we started to discuss those things during history lessons. I couldn't comprehend why anyone would do all those horrible things. Even more mind-baffling for me was to learn about the Nazi's reasoning for all the things they did. All of it just made no sense to me.

  What we learned was basically everything. I roughly remember talking about Rome and the french revolution for about the first two years. The following four years in school were all about WW1 and WW2. Given the timeframe in which both WW were discussed, you can imagine we really dove deep in those topics. I can't give you any specifics here since I don't remember it all, but it was a really in-depth look at things. One thing I remember though is that we talked about what was going on in Germany at the time, how the people felt and how it was possible that some austrian fuck could gain power.
  Also, alot of it has also been discussions about what we think we would've done. They really tried to make us understand that something like that can't be allowed happen again and also that it's a part of our responsibility to make that sure.


  Sorry if a list of topics was what you longed for, but I hope I could provide a little bit of insight not only into the things we learned, but also how it felt to discuss those things for me.",2016-06-23 12:25:07+00:00,d4koq04,1.0,t3_4pfnig,15482,AskReddit

70,"You're right. There are a bunch of concepts you gotta master to play this game properly. But, and that's atleast in my opinion the case, people seem to misunderstand the purpose of this exact video and seemingly steel misunderstood the point of this video aswell.

  Ofcourse holding angles, preaiming and all that are important concepts that are equally important, but saying that you gotta stop moving, scope in and sometimes even have to flick and shoot is NOT wrong.

  That's the very essence of using the AWP and hitting shots with it. You gotta stop to gain the maximum accuracy in this game, with the AWP it's highly recommended to scope and sometimes you even gotta flick. If you don't do that, you can't even preaim a corner or whatever else steel said was bullshit (in warowl's vid) in the beginning of the video posted above. Then, and only then, can you think about teaching someone how to properly position themselves, preaim blah blah blah. I think those are more advanced concepts than simply using the AWP (that's firing it and actually hitting something).

  I mean, I get it. For most of us this shit comes naturally, we know the importance of holding angles, preaiming, positioning etc., but for a beginner this certainly is not that much of a pile of shit like steel made it sound.",2016-06-17 16:11:43+00:00,d4d6bz1,8.0,t1_d4d0yat,7334,GlobalOffensive

  WarOwl puts so much effort into his videos, it's a shame someone like steel, especially that fkin guy, felt the need to take a dump on this awesome dude, who tries his best to help other people understand this game.

  E:  
Since people felt the need to discuss this a bit, the point I'm trying to make here can be explained with the following analogy:  

Imagine you gotta teach someone how to write. The thing you do first is to teach them the alphabet. If they know the alphabet, you can start teaching them how to write.

  I agree with the people who keep talking about positioning, holding angles etc. (being the ability to AWP properly; call it basics if you like), but before that, you gotta learn the basics (How to shoot that fucking thing in the first place; call it basics of the basics if you like).

  I'm by no means an expert, but if you ask me, that approach to teaching someone how to AWP (who never played the game) is not as dumb as people make it sound. And yes, ofcourse there's more to it and in that, steel surely has a point. But that's not a reason to completely ridicule someone else's effort.

85,"Not sure if I'm able to explain this properly (not my first language), but for me a huge factor has always been to know where the enemy actually might be at any point in time (like, having awareness of your surroundings and the position you are in etc.). See, I'm  playing this game for roughly 10 years now (GO and previous iterations of CS that is) and I, over the years, somehow developed a sense for where the enemy could be. I'm not saying that it takes that long to know those things, but that that's a thing that comes with experience I guess.

  The more you play, the more likely you are to know where the enemy probably plays from in certain situations (e.g. as T on Inferno in the beginning of the round a CT might be awping mid, so stay close to the left wall if you're not trying to challenge him; Where the CTs might be, if you've successfully taken top mid), know the angles they might be holding etc. I think that this is what most people mean when they talk about gamesense. Also, being aware which behaviour could trigger which reaction of your enemies (and the other way around), e.g. as T on D2 flashing long from short to pretend you are there to make the oponent playing on A site worry about long aswell and things like that. Playing mindgames with your enemy is the point I'm trying to make here, I guess.

  There surely is a lot more to it and I'm by no means an expert, but I always felt like those things matter a lot. Hope this helps, buddy!


  E: One thing I just thought about was being aware of the possibility that your enemy might try to play off-angles, so it's not only the ""usual"" spots you have to worry about. I think there's not much you can do about that, except for maybe try to shoulderpeek if you're about to walk around corners. Maybe you can bait a shot, the enemy gives his position away and he retreats (which is good, because you gain more room to play with) or you kill him. This won't always work and can backfire aswell, but sometimes you'll catch someone off guard.


  E2: You mentioned that your aim is on point most of the time and you're able to take out higher ranked players aswell. That will only help you to a certain point. ""Brain"" as people like to call it, is what, imho, truly seperates the average from the good players. Play the game, hone your skills and keep learning from your mistakes. Always question your plays, even if you maybe think they were good. Maybe there's something you could've done better. If you truly want to get better, try to learn from your mistakes, but also from the things you did well.

96,"&gt;  Binding Letter of Intent

  Well, ""binding"" is the term that's used by LG. SK on the other hand confirmed with lawyers in Britain and Germany that those LOI
could've been ""bypassed"" (for the lack of a better word, not my first language) at any given time.

  Also
&gt; which could be seen as a contract

  According to Thorin, that heavily depends on the phrasing of said letters. In general tho, letters of intent express nothing more than the intention to do something at a certain point in time. Those letters specified a two week long period in which the LG players should've gotten their new contracts. As far as I'm informed, nothing happend within that period, because the players felt under pressure since they had to play the major in the upcoming days and didn't want to bother themselves with those things. They wanted to focus on the major. The owner of LG was okay with that, because he trusted his players to deal it after they played the major. Somewhere in between the players signed a contract with SK. 

  Now, that approach by SK is seen as ""poaching"" in some parts of the world and perfectly legal in other parts of the world. Atleast that's what I've heard, I'm no expert. There are a few factors here, which could decide the outcome of that whole situation, for example the place where the contracts were signed. Again, I'm no expert, but that's atleast what I've heard.

They worked their asses off to be where they are today. They don't deserve to be in this position, just because they made a mistake or became to greedy in a world that's evolving so rapidly. That's no excuse, but not a single one of us knows how overwhelming those things can get, especially if you basically had nothing at one point.

110,"IMO, the interesting part was when Thorin said that LG basically was an average organization at best. I don't know much about orgs, so except for the big players like C9, CLG and shit I don't really now a thing. 

  It's indeed, uhm, a little bit mysterious if you look at it from that perspective. When I first read the espn article I was like ""Uhm, yeah, SK wants to be relevant again"". In hindsight tho I'd say the answers given by LG in this article seem to be given with the intention of putting SK in a really bad light, especially after Thorin's video. Think about it for a second. Only after LG received a huge financial boost (relative to the size of the org) due to the team winning the major, the LG org aswell as the players were somehow able to magically work out something that made the players stay for whatever reason and weren't able to prior to the event. 
  
  The question here is, what are those reasons? Were the players threatened to not get their share of the prize money? Maybe that's going a bit too far, but who knows, right? But then again, why did they feel like they needed some sort of legal counsel before if there's not something shady going on in the background? Also, from an owners perspective a team that's suddenly really successful surely is an valuable asset and would, in theory atleast, provide a motive to try and pull some shady shit. I'm not into those kinds of theories at all, but that's some fucked up shit right there. 

Also, for anyone interested, here's a [link](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/counterstrike/Luminosity_Gaming#Achievements) with some information regarding the team, placements, it's winnings and all that. The team as it's now was formed on the 23rd of November, 2015.

I'm just saying - and that I know from experience - that the other players are to blame aswell for not recognizing that there is an issue somewhere that needs to be fixed and not figuring out what it is and what actions have to be taken to fix the problem while being on the server. 

  In my 20 years of football (soccer) I haven't seen it once that if a player who played like complete and utter shit was allowed to play the entire game without the rest of the team atleast telling him to get his shit together. And if that wasn't enough, the coach would've swapped him out.

  Also, if you say that he's a professional, you're right. But saying that and adding points like ""it's his job"" doesn't change the fact that he's indeed young and inexperienced. I would expect veterans like Hiko or Adren to guide him, recognize his mistakes and tell him what to do better. In fact, in team games, like football for example, it's only natural to see such behaviour. 

  Also, I do agree that it's awesome that we now have someone like mOe, who's not afraid to talk about the ugly truths and I also firmly believe that critique is very much needed for a player to grow.

138,"Overall an very interesting talk. I don't know much about hastr0, but judging by this talk I think that he has - obviously, because he's a member - a good understanding of what's going on with WESA. I also had the feeling that, while being a business man, he not only has his teams success in mind, but the game's success aswell. But, as I said, I don't know much about hastr0.

  **My opinion:** 
  Imo, the fundamental idea of having a body like WESA, which can help the game grow and create a safe environment for teams/players by providing certain rules, making sure certain conditions are met and all that, is good. Which things specifically have to be done and what rules have to be in place, I have no idea, I'm not an expert at all. There are also a lot of things in this talk, like broadcasting rights and ticket revenue, which I think a lot of people - in the community that is - haven't thought about yet and need to be adressed in the future. Who else, if not a body like WESA, can make sure that all those things happen in the best interest of teams and players? Should each team handle those situations on it's own? Currently, that's what happens. Teams are handling their shit alone and it's working. But won't they have a stronger position in the ecosystem when they work together? I think their position would be a stronger one. Has it to be WESA who represents teams and players? Without a doubt, ESL is one of the leading players in the ecosystem right now. They have the experience, they know how to get things done in the business. Did they try to pull some weird shit in the past? Yes. So, should we put our trust in those guys?

  A part of problem with WESA is that they weren't able to communicate their intentions/goals in a way so that people/the community could get behind it. Maybe the fact that their project was leaked pushed them, from a PR perspective, in a corner. But does that justify the answers they gave us? I mean, those guys are professionals. One could expect that they, after a year of planning the whole thing, would be able to communicate what their goals/intentions are.

  First of all, they pretend to be transparent while not being transparent at all. Questions that could be answered with a simple 'yes' or 'no' are wrapped in PR-bullshit. Like, why is it that they say ""Players have a voice!"" and not ""Players can give their opinion on certain things, like this, this and this.""? I feel tricked by their approach to this whole situation. They intentionally make it sound like players indeed have a say in what's going to happen, when all they have is a opinion they can give when asked.

  Then, why are they pretending to be an ""completely independent entity"" when they have two ESL executives on their board? And on top of that a person who, in the case of a tie, decides the course of action, but who is obviously hired by these ESL guys? Why are they not open about it and say ""Yeah, that's an initiative that's promoted by ESL. We have experience and we thought it's time to make a change in the industry, strengthening the teams and players positions against ...""? Also, and that's a point Thorin made, no one is fucking mad at you, when you try to push your own business. But don't pretend that that's not what you're also trying to do.

  Then, the aforementioned guy, Pietro Fringuelli or whatever, when asked what guarantees his independence on the board says 'Nothing.'. Like, really?

  And those are only a few of the points. I cannot even imagine what they could have done to make this even worse.

  Back to the question. Should we put our trust in those guys? Right now, I would say no. Till now, they have done nothing that made them earn our trust. As I said, they should have known better. Did they not learn from their previous mistakes? They should have known what happens when they in one moment try to convince us that they want to be transparent and in the next throw PR bullshit at us.

  **What I want WESA to do now:** 
  I believe that such a thing can work and that it indeed can help teams, players and the whole scene and that exclusivity is not necessarily a bad thing. I would even go as far as to say that we indeed need such a thing. But for me to accept such a concept, I have to understand it.

* Why do they think that a body like WESA is necessary?
* What do they expect to happen in the next five years?
* What is, from a business perspective, their motivation?

  I want WESA to come forth and tell us, completely open and honest,

* what ESL's involvement is,

* why it's good for them,

* why it's good for teams and players/the scene and

* how the supporting processes look like.

* How do the involved parties, in detail, benefit from being a part of WESA?

* What specifically is it, that will help teams?

* What will help the players?

  Try to tell me those things, without any bullshit and maybe I'll be less skeptical about the whole thing. Welp, that's it. Not my first language, but I hope I got the message across. I guess that all I want is true transparency and honesty, so that I can be sure that the game and the players we all love so much are not fked by this in the long run.",2016-05-21 12:47:49+00:00,d3e210r,1.0,t3_4k8k1q,79376,GlobalOffensive

155,"Thank you very much! People make it sound like the FineBros are trying to copyright the general idea of filming people react to something and upload it. Is this truly what they're trying to do? 

&gt; I can only guess 'format' would be the sort of thing that lets you have different versions of a show like, say, Big Brother in different countries.

&gt; Alternatively, it might just be the combination of all those elements together that makes a ""format""

 For me the term 'format' implies that there is a certain concept behind it (like you said, e.g. Big Brother; People getting locked up in some sort of container, no contact to the outside world etc.). Now, I haven't seen a single video of them in a long time. Is there a certain, a specific concept behind those videos that's not vague in any form and doesn't change (significantly) with every video?

 Let's say I'm producing a new TV show called Big Sister. The concept behind the show would be putting people in a container, no contact to the outside world and filming them (you see where this is going). Naturally I would expect Endemol (the creator of Big Brother) to tell me that it's not okay to make a show like that, since it's exactly the same concept as theirs for Big Brother. 

 If that's how it works, then the whole problem with this story would be that they're (intentionally?) not precise enough about what their 'format' is and, with their description regarding their 'format', that they potentially could target everyone uploading/showing any form of reaction video (no matter the structure/makeup), right?",2016-01-31 15:40:59+00:00,czimmv5,3.0,t1_czikf9l,5533,videos

 Also, can anyone elaborate on copyright ELI5-style? I mean, sure, it's about protecting your own intellectual property and such, but why is it allowed to copyright ""normal human behaviour"" like someone reacting to something and anything that has to do with it? Where are the lines of what you can copyright and what not?

 This playstyle may not give you consistent frags all the time and you'll be punished alot for it, but it certainly can make a difference if done properly. A good example for this playstyle would be JW on Inferno I think. We could argue that probably no one of us has his ability, but our enemies aren't as good as his aswell. Being rather static is your biggest opponent. Switch things up, be unpredictable.


 T side is indeed an entirely different story, but IMO, being passive won't get you anywhere. Being passive as an AWPer on T-side Inferno (atleast for me) involves the expectation that your opponents actually show themselves which, in theory, shouldn't happen too often. Doing the unexpected is what I try to do. And, as much as I hate to admit it, this gets me killed more than I'd like to.
