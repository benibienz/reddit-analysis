  Sad thing is, I can't even remember the whole story and what the movie was about really.  

**The only things I remember are:**  

  * In the beginning of the movie, two dudes are in a jail or something. Shortly after that, they're fleeing together - in chains. That's one thing I remember vividly. They're running away for quite a while, crossing a river and finally - if my memory serves me right - reach some kind of farm. Here they're able to finally get rid of the chains across their ankles. Not 100% sure about the last part.

  * At some point, they find / have some ""kung-fu-style""-instruction kind of book. They start training together in whatever style was described in that book. That training I also remember vividly since, as a kid, I thought it was awesome how they trained. They trained with buckets full of water and lots of kinda improvised things.

  Sadly, that's all I remember. Would be absolutely awesome if there's someone around who knows what movie I'm talking about.

  E: Kinda late over here in Germany. I'll make sure to reply to everyone in the morning.

  **Update:** Thanks to /u/jinxi_me_this ! You are a god amongst men!  

  The movie is **Stroke of Death aka Monkey Kung Fu 1979, Shaw Bros. original name: Chu long ma liu (Drunken Monkey)**",kungfucinema,Looking for a movie I watched with my dad as a kid,https://www.reddit.com/r/kungfucinema/comments/4yrd2l/looking_for_a_movie_i_watched_with_my_dad_as_a_kid/

  So, I'm close to getting my bachelor's degree in business information systems and I'm currently looking for a topic. 
  
  I've done a lot of research already and found some interesting things, like predictive policing (cool topic if you liked Minority Report), cloud computing, big data and such, but I'd love to hear your opinion on what the hottest topics in IT or related to information systems currently are.

  Also, if you have some recommendations regarding books, articles, videos or whatever you consider worth reading / looking into (and fit into that context), feel free to post them! I'll definitely take a look at all of them. Thanks in advance!

so, while my WW buddy was snowboarding for a week, I decided to start playing a deathknight.
 
We're a bunch of filthy casuals and don't take it too serious overall, but at the same time we hate losing. The reason for us losing is that I'm not really able to figure out how to survive the enemy burst, espacially when facing double DD comps. Imo, I tried everything from trying to kite (not sure what it's called in englando, but with Chains of Ice) the enemy as soon as they pop their CDs to simply trying to pop my defensive CDs and healing against (while mainly tanking...) their damage.

My itemlevel is at 704, which isn't too bad considering the time I invested till now. Also, I copy the gear from the leaderboards, so the parts should be (asides from the parts I couldn't upgrade yet) okay. I think gear is not the main issue here. The main issue seems to be my playstyle.

So, my questions would be:
a) How do I survive the enemy burst when facing double DD comps? Currently I'm running with Death Siphon. Is Death Pact an alternative for facing those comps?

 b) What should the overall playstyle of our comp look like? (I think I get where the synergy of that comp should come from, like setting up a stun lock on the killtarget, maybe grabbing the second enemy into my buddy's FoF aswell etc.) Should we engage? Should we wait for the enemy?

 Thanks in advance!",worldofpvp,DK struggling with survivability in 2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldofpvp/comments/4acyie/dk_struggling_with_survivability_in_2s/
