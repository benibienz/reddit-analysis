47,"When it comes to records in that area a LOT of boxrec records are WRONG when it comes to novices. I'm not saying those kids were any good or had extensive careers but it's unlikely they were all making their debuts. Sadly a lot of the confusion comes from the fact a lot change their names, and some local countries don't full record bouts. 

Interestingly there is a Thai based Iranian who fought a couple of weeks back, losing in South Korea, that bout however isn't on his boxrec record due to the fact boxrec don't recognise the Korean body which sanctioned the bout (the KBA).

Also Thai's pad their records with these bouts to get paid, it's a bit like the fighters of old doing it for a pay day between more notable fights. The ""bigger names"" help fill the stadiums which help the promoter get more sponsorship money and help give the younger fighters (for example Jirapan Nakornloung on this particular card) some attention.
