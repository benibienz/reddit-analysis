I'm working on a just for fun build. It's weird, i'm more addicted to building the computers now than using them..

So I picked up the common Dell Optiplex 755 for $15 bucks. I would like to spend $85 more to build the cheapest best PC i can for 100 bucks w/o windows OS.

I Need - 
~~GPU - Max $50 ~~( I have a Evga GTX 460 Can trade as well)
~~PSU - At least a 430W of a 'known' brand ~~

I want -
~~2x1GB 800mhz DDR2 to add to my curreng 2GB --- or --- 2x2GB 800mhz DDR2 ram - $CHEAP$ ~~

Doubt anyone would have any of these CPUs but if you do, I would like it! -
Q6700
~~Q6600~~

Also, if I broke any posting rules let me know, i'll quickly fix it! Thanks!",hardwareswap,"[USA-IA] [H] Paypal, Local Cash [W] Graphics Card, PSU, RAM",https://www.reddit.com/r/hardwareswap/comments/4xhuf5/usaia_h_paypal_local_cash_w_graphics_card_psu_ram/
