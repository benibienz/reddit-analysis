I've never heard of nocturnal seizures, so I'm not entirely sure what you deal with, but the term ""gran mal"" is outdated, and both gran mal and petit mal were supplanted by terms that offer greater specificity into seizure type, like tonic, tonic-clonic, atonic, absence, atypical absence, gelastic, complex-partial, and so on. 

You are sort of on the right track when stating if you mean that there is no reason to restrain someone who is having five minutes of atypical absence seizure activity, but why would that have to be said? Of course one wouldn't restrain a person who is not moving anyway. The point I was making with my original comment is that the type of seizures that cause people to go rigid or into convulsions are the type that would disrupt a fellow passenger, but they are also the type you never restrain. So that is why I stated that the seizure explanation is bullshit. Apologies for the length.",2016-10-17 21:40:24+00:00,d8wbp5j,3.0,t1_d8vzcv7,14686.0,TumblrInAction

Children that young don't understand their behavior the way adults do, that's why it is incumbent on the adult to shape the behavior. If a child is throwing a tantrum to get attention then yelling at him or her only reinforces the behavior in the future - thus yelling at the toddler to stop the screaming is a very short-term solution and a long-term failure. 

Moreover, there is no reason for the owner to resort to this. I get that the parents were doing a shitty job, so ask them to leave and offer to bag up their food. If they refuse, give them an ultimatum of quieting the child or having the police escort them out. Shaming the parents would serve as a better deterrent, they'd likely not return to a restaurant where being escorted out by the police was a possibility.
