I gave credit to this subreddit because I personally felt more comfortable doing so — this is where *I* saw the story, after all — but it's still public information (that I'm pretty sure the OP saw in a Facebook group originally), which (in my opinion) makes it different than blindly stealing that sex worker story (especially when some outlets lied about talking to the OP). 


I've tried my best to be transparent and even brought some conversation to this sub from my perspective as I've actually interacted with some of the cast members! That said, I hope my presence in this sub doesn't make anyone uncomfortable. At the end of the day, I'm still a fan and enjoy interacting with other fans!
