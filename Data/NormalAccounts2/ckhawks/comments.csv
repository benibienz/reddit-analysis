Things can be a bit hard to pick up the in beginning, if you've got questions most people will be more than happy to answer them.

Few quick tips:

* Most people will say try not to steal from teammates in pubs (public matches), but don't get yourself down if you accidentally do a few times  
* Practice just pushing the puck around and shooting in your own private server  
* The current season is coming to a close, so you will be able to register for the next season soon if you want to play (semi-)competitively. Beginners typically play in the JSL for a season or two.

254,"I've played all three of these games.

Black Ops 3 is definitely just a blatantly kill people, not much thinking involved. Not too much realism either.

If you're looking for tactical realistic (to an extent) gameplay I'd definitely recommend Arma III. I've hit 300 hours and I still don't know some of the things I can do in this game, and I haven't really touched the mission making, mod making, etc. There's loads of things to do, including quite a lot of mission types.

Factorio is also tons of fun. It's an industrial game about automation and progression. There are a lot of mods for Factorio, and modding the game is very easy (similarly to Arma). Making mods for Factorio isn't too difficult either.

Factorio is the highest rated game on Steam right now, and there's no doubt as to why.

If you're wondering which of these games will give you the most playtime, I'd say Arma has the most replayability, followed closely by Factorio, and finally Black Ops. Don't get me wrong, if you enjoy just straight up killing people Black Ops could get some high use.

Check out the subreddits /r/arma /r/factorio

438,"Alright, so:

You shower once a day, give or take. I don't know, you may shower a lot. 

Each shower lasts from 10 minutes to 30 minutes, so we'll just go with a baseline of 20 minutes.

365.25 days in a year (leap years) and the average person started showering at about age.. 9? I don't know, let's go with that.

And you will probably live to about age 80.

80 - those first 8 years (before 9 y/o) is 71 years * 365.25 gives us the amount of days you have showered and then you multiply that times 20 minutes to give us the amount of minutes. Divide it once more by 60 to get amount of hours, and then divide ONCE more by 24 to get the total amount of days...

I got about 360 days. Almost a year of showering.
