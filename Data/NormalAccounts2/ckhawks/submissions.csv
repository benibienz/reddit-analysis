Shark-        Olli: When nothing was going TX’s way in the regular season, I’ll admit I caused some problems with you. You immediately stepped up the next game and got a hattrick, giving us a rare win. Whenever we needed someone to step up, you did in a big way. 2 playoff hattricks in series clinching games is no small feat. You have a lot of skill in net as well, but your strength is definitely up front. Keep working hard and you have a good chance of being RSL next season, just try to be on Steam more so youre easier to contact. 
Toaster: you will be an all star offenseman, don’t let people doubt your ability like I was. Show them you’re a god with those hat tricks

Keller-        Olli: The man of few words and many flails. Your ability to make nearly any game a fun time is an asset in and of itself. Not only are you decently skilled on the puck as a forward, youre a great “locker room presence” that a team needs to keep things light. Even though it lagged your computer for some reason, you still got on TS for the playoffs and I am really appreciative of that. Keep on vpasing and headbobbing. You too with the steam thing, just be easier to contact.
Toaster: adfhogfjb ogfjb idnjstrhi dvojbxcio  p

You are the reason I like playing JSL mate you kept it fun and kept me in a good mood with your  fjbicvnjbic iothys dfva, if you hadn’t of done that and kept me laughing we wouldn’t of won as many games.

Holtbeast-  Olli: I traded for you bc you had a goal and we needed someone who could score desperately. First game on TX, what do you do? Score a fluky goal. Great person to chat with on steam despite you not making it to too many games.  You came in so clutch coming in on Wednesday, playing a position you dont normally play, and holding your own. IDK how game 4 and 5 would have went if we had to do 4 v 4. Even though you didn’t get your MSL-esque goal you wanted, you came in just as clutch.  
Toaster: where did this dude come from? Oh that’s pretty good!

Seal-	       Olli: You were only able to make Mondays this season and thats a shame. When you were able to come you were fun to play with, and you played well in your brief time. I’m really sorry you didnt get to play in the playoffs, the IWA series got weird with lines and you fell through the cracks. Hope to see you around in pubs/next season!
Toaster: i bet you hit some fucking dingers. Gonna give u more playtime when I get a chance to. Sometime in the future I’ll get you that playtime I fucked on accident

Cosamaximus- Olli: Easy to contact most of the time, and decent attendance. You were always one of the first people in the TS and ready to practice and go for the game. I see a lot of promise in you as a defenseman, just need some practice. If you practice, with your dependability, youd be a great pickup for someone who needs defense in JSL. Hope you enjoyed your calzone 
Toaster: why does everyone spell your name wrong? There’s no A!!! Why do you like dicks so much?? Keep your stick on the ground and you’re a great defenseman

Johnson- Olli: You made it to a few regular season games and with the time difference thats pretty admirable. You’ve got a lot of hockey smarts and a good presence that any team would want. I’m sure youll tear it up in CHL and if you chose to do NA leagues, I have faith that youll do well. 
	Toaster: rip ping, make it bazing!!



MangledBagel- Olli: You were a late season acquisition that turned out to be pretty great. You stepped up big time in the playoffs filling in for a late Erikvm in game 1 of the finals. When you played, you held your own and I felt comfortable with you in front of me. Keep at the game and you’ll be great in no time. 
		Toaster: you did well with the time you were given come back next season for a good time ;)
NetflixNChill (Ove)- Olli: You basically requested a trade by requesting more playing time on a team with 3 goalies. I tried to get you to a team that gave more playing time and then you stopped playing so idrk what to tell you. You played well in net when you did play. Stick around for a full season sometime!
Toaster: you are a good friend and a nice person and a pretty fucking good goalie, don’t doubt yourself 
Dcat- Olli: you played a few games in net and on defense and you played okay. With some practice, you can get a lot better. Thanks for being a great part of the community doing streaming and such.
	Toaster: you have 2 many potential

Erikvm-      Olli: My co-assistant GM!. We knew this team had promise with our veteran core, but we never showed it because there were maybe 2 games in the regular season where me, you, and toaster were all in game. Nevertheless, you are one of my favorite defensemen that I’ve gotten to play behind. Being comfortable with your defense is so key when in net and you were able to do just that. You came back for playoffs and teared it up with toaster, defensively and offensively. One of the best d pairings in the JSL, if not the best. Hope to see you next season in RSL. We did it for doggo.
Toaster: pupper no suffer

Olli- Toaster: shut the fuck up

Toaster- Olli:Oy my closest HQM friend. Toaster you are a phenomenal leader and player. You drafted an amazing team that didn’t exactly pan out as you expected with unexpected retirements, attendance issues, and people disappearing from the community. However, you built a team that could win, even without those pieces, and when it all came together in the playoffs it was as good as it gets. I wouldnt want to win my first cup with anyone but you. Youre an incredibly talented defenseman, with a great scoring touch.  Its a wonder that you arent RSL already but after this season I think you will have cemented yourself a spot in the RSL. 

Toaster: you are trash
