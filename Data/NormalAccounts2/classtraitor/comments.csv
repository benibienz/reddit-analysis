As in Panama, the official U.S. justification in Grenada was to defend the lives of American citizens.*

&gt;*""We have not been told why, when Europe is on the peaceful road to democratization, force is still used in Latin America,"" complained Guatemalan President Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo.*

...

&gt;*Calling the attack by the United States ''a step backward in international relations,'' Brazil's President, Jose Sarney, said, ''We profoundly lament this event.''*

...

&gt; *Mexico urged ""an immediate cessation of hostilities"" in Panama, even while noting Noriega's ties to drug traffickers. ""Fighting international crime is no excuse for intervention in a sovereign nation.""*

...

&gt; *Nicaragua's Sandinista rulers, fearful of a related U.S. military attack against them, put their armed forces on a ""state of combative general alert"" and deployed troops, tanks and anti-aircraft guns in the streets of Managua.*

...

&gt;*President Alan Garcia of Peru, long a strong critic of Panama's military dictatorship, announced that he was withdrawing Peru's Ambassador from Washington until United States troops are withdrawn from Panamanian territory.*

...

&gt;*In Cuba, the Communist Government condemned this ''new imperialist aggression against our Latin American peoples.'' Cuba's Foreign Ministry described the military move as ''incredible evidence of the disdain of the United States for international law.''*

**(Here's what the red stuff says)**


Statement in Support of American Black People's Anti-Repression Struggle


(April 16, 1968)


Recently, the Black American Martin Luther King was suddenly murdered by American imperialists. Martin Luther King was an advocate of non-violence, but this did not lead the American imperialists to be lenient to him, rather they used counter-revolutionary violence to bloodily suppress him. This was a profound lesson to American Blacks, arousing a new storm of anti-repression struggle unprecedented in American history, engulfing over 100 American cities. This makes clear that within the over 20 million Black Americans there is an extremely strong revolutionary force.


That this storm of struggle by Black people should occur within America is a vivid manifestation of the political and economic crisis afflicting American imperialism. It has struck a heavy blow to the imperialists who are beset on all sides, at home and abroad.


This struggle of American Blacks is not merely a matter of the oppressed and exploited Black people taking up the struggle for freedom and liberation, it is a clarion call for all the oppressed and exploited people of America to oppose the tyrannical rule of monopoly capitalism. It is of tremendous help and encouragement to the struggle of people all over the world against American imperialism, and the struggle of people of Vietnam against American imperialism. I represent all the people of China in expressing steadfast support of the righteous struggle of America's Black people. 


Racial discrimination in America is a product of colonialism and imperialism. The contradictions between the broad masses of American Black people and the ruling clique are class contradictions. Only by overthrowing America's monopoly capitalistic regime, and smashing the colonialist and imperialist system, can Black Americans achieve thorough liberation. The broad masses of American Blacks and the White working masses have common interests and a common goal for their struggles. Therefore, the struggles of American Black people are receiving more and more sympathy and support from working people and progressives among American Whites. The struggle of American Blacks must unite with the American workers' movement, and put an end to the nightmarish regime of American monopoly capital.


In my 1963 ""Statement in support of the righteous struggle of American Blacks against American imperialist racial discrimination"", I said: ""The evil colonialist and imperialist system arose in the wake of slavery, and it must end with the thorough liberation of Black people."" I still insist on this view.


Presently, world revolution has entered a great new era. The struggle of American Black people for liberation is one part of the world struggle against American imperialism, one part of the world revolution. I call upon the entire world's workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and any people willing to oppose American imperialism to take action and give the struggle of American Black people strong support! The entire world's people should unite even more closely to make a long lasting and ferocious attack on our common enemy, American imperialism and its accomplices! we can be sure that the collapse of colonialism, imperialism, and all systems of exploitation, and the emancipation of all the oppressed people and oppressed races of the Earth, is close at hand.

A Diagram of the Situation of Black Americans' Anti-Tyranny Struggle


A historically unprecedented new storm of anti-tyranny struggle by Black Americans spread with astonishing speed through over 100 American cities. This makes clear that within the over 20 million Black Americans there is an extremely strong revolutionary force. It has struck a heavy blow to the imperialists who are beset on all sides, at home and abroad.


**(In the boxes pointing to places)**


Kansas City: Black snipers bravely and skillfully fired on reactionary forces for five days and nights, forcing 4,000 police and troops into retreat/


Memphis: Anti-violence advocate Martin Luther King was murdered by American imperialist on April 4th in Memphis. This was a profound lesson to American Blacks, arousing a new storm of anti-repression struggle unprecedented in American history, engulfing over 100 American cities.


Chicago: America's largest city is ablaze. Black snipers with appear and disappear mysteriously, frightening reactionary forces out of their wits.


Pittsburgh: In America's iron and steel city Pittsburgh, the authorities declare martial law. But the Black masses are uncowed. Many large fires burn within the city. 


Baltimore: In America's sixth largest city Baltimore, Black people's fighting spirit is high, they fight resolutely in spite of suppression. The Black masses light over 500 fires of retribution in the city, and snipers' gunshots ring out without a stop.


Washington: The Black masses, unafraid of brutal violence, rebel against the American rule of the monopoly capitalist class. Black people's fires of retribution burn near the Capitol and the White House. Black snipers attack the police everywhere. This heart of American imperialism, the nest of White racist oppressors, is blackened by smoke, lit by flames, filled with rubble. The imperialist ringleader Johnson is so frightened he cannot sleep, his eyes bloodshot, paces around the White House like an ant on a hot griddle.

Statement in Support of American Black People's Anti-Repression Struggle


(April 16, 1968)


Recently, the Black American Martin Luther King was suddenly murdered by American imperialists. Martin Luther King was an advocate of non-violence, but this did not lead the American imperialists to be lenient to him, rather they used counter-revolutionary violence to bloodily suppress him. This was a profound lesson to American Blacks, arousing a new storm of anti-repression struggle unprecedented in American history, engulfing over 100 American cities. This makes clear that within the over 20 million Black Americans there is an extremely strong revolutionary force.


That this storm of struggle by Black people should occur within America is a vivid manifestation of the political and economic crisis afflicting American imperialism. It has struck a heavy blow to the imperialists who are beset on all sides, at home and abroad.


This struggle of American Blacks is not merely a matter of the oppressed and exploited Black people taking up the struggle for freedom and liberation, it is a clarion call for all the oppressed and exploited people of America to oppose the tyrannical rule of monopoly capitalism. It is of tremendous help and encouragement to the struggle of people all over the world against American imperialism, and the struggle of people of Vietnam against American imperialism. I represent all the people of China in expressing steadfast support of the righteous struggle of America's Black people. 


Racial discrimination in America is a product of colonialism and imperialism. The contradictions between the broad masses of American Black people and the ruling clique are class contradictions. Only by overthrowing America's monopoly capitalistic regime, and smashing the colonialist and imperialist system, can Black Americans achieve thorough liberation. The broad masses of American Blacks and the White working masses have common interests and a common goal for their struggles. Therefore, the struggles of American Black people are receiving more and more sympathy and support from working people and progressives among American Whites. The struggle of American Blacks must unite with the American workers' movement, and put an end to the nightmarish regime of American monopoly capital.


In my 1963 ""Statement in support of the righteous struggle of American Blacks against American imperialist racial discrimination"", I said: ""The evil colonialist and imperialist system arose in the wake of slavery, and it must end with the thorough liberation of Black people."" I still insist on this view.


Presently, world revolution has entered a great new era. The struggle of American Black people for liberation is one part of the world struggle against American imperialism, one part of the world revolution. I call upon the entire world's workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and any people willing to oppose American imperialism to take action and give the struggle of American Black people strong support! The entire world's people should unite even more closely to make a long lasting and ferocious attack on our common enemy, American imperialism and its accomplices! we can be sure that the collapse of colonialism, imperialism, and all systems of exploitation, and the emancipation of all the oppressed people and oppressed races of the Earth, is close at hand.

A Diagram of the Situation of Black Americans' Anti-Tyranny Struggle


A historically unprecedented new storm of anti-tyranny struggle by Black Americans spread with astonishing speed through over 100 American cities. This makes clear that within the over 20 million Black Americans there is an extremely strong revolutionary force. It has struck a heavy blow to the imperialists who are beset on all sides, at home and abroad.


**(In the boxes pointing to places)**


Kansas City: Black snipers bravely and skillfully fired on reactionary forces for five days and nights, forcing 4,000 police and troops into retreat/


Memphis: Anti-violence advocate Martin Luther King was murdered by American imperialist on April 4th in Memphis. This was a profound lesson to American Blacks, arousing a new storm of anti-repression struggle unprecedented in American history, engulfing over 100 American cities.


Chicago: America's largest city is ablaze. Black snipers with appear and disappear mysteriously, frightening reactionary forces out of their wits.


Pittsburgh: In America's iron and steel city Pittsburgh, the authorities declare martial law. But the Black masses are uncowed. Many large fires burn within the city. 


Baltimore: In America's sixth largest city Baltimore, Black people's fighting spirit is high, they fight resolutely in spite of suppression. The Black masses light over 500 fires of retribution in the city, and snipers' gunshots ring out without a stop.


Washington: The Black masses, unafraid of brutal violence, rebel against the American rule of the monopoly capitalist class. Black people's fires of retribution burn near the Capitol and the White House. Black snipers attack the police everywhere. This heart of American imperialism, the nest of White racist oppressors, is blackened by smoke, lit by flames, filled with rubble. The imperialist ringleader Johnson is so frightened he cannot sleep, his eyes bloodshot, paces around the White House like an ant on a hot griddle.

121,"There's a lot of literature about Darwin's understanding of altruism, though it's described in other words, like sympathy and cooperation. Mostly this comes from Darwin's work in The Descent of Man, published 12 years after The Origin of Species, with additional quotes such as:

&gt;*As man advances in civilization, and small tribes are united into larger communities, the simplest reason would tell each individual that he ought to extend his social instincts and sympathies to all members of the same nation, though personally unknown to him. This point being once reached, there is only an artificial barrier to prevent his sympathies extending to the men of all nations and races.*

and

&gt;*On the other hand, the habit followed by the males of some social animals of defending the community, and of attacking their enemies or their prey in concert, may perhaps have originated from mutual sympathy; but courage, and in most cases strength, must have been previously acquired, probably through natural selection.*

&gt;*So it is with ourselves. Even when we are quite alone, how often do we think with pleasure or pain of what others think of us,‚Äî of their imagined approbation or disapprobation; and this all follows from sympathy, a fundamental element of the social instincts. A man who possessed no trace of such instincts would be an unnatural monster.*",2015-08-19 14:25:41+00:00,cu89izl,2,t1_cu7lku5,56471,QuotesPorn

135,"If you live and see your world through television shows as models of society, that just proves your problem. Also, perhaps you should study some biology instead of pop culture. If you take a look at species that are the most successful ‚Äî the most complex and intelligent ‚Äî you'd see that their ""competitive"" prowess depends entirely on cooperative instincts and skills. Mammals are the most obvious example. Not only do they operate within complex social systems, they are literally incapable of surviving on their own ‚Äî and yet they are the most intelligent animals on Earth. This goes especially for whales and dolphins, whose social organizations in the case of large-brained dolphins are complex enough to encompass the definition of cultures, and don't kill within their own species. Even primates, who are often violent (in some, not all species) against one another, ultimately exist within cooperative groups and are interdependent. Find an animal without a family, without nurturing, without socialization ‚Äî and there you will see jellyfish, reptiles, spawn. This idea of a man on his own is the fiction ‚Äî more fictional even than reality television.

And to talk about the dawn of man as not socialist in nature is to pretty much ignore the phase of primitive communism of our species, which lasted for over a hundred thousand years, the majority of our existence. Even by the development of agriculture and civilization, our accomplishments were only as great as our capacity to cooperate, to live interdependently, and work collectively.

It implies that you understand ""man's nature"" ‚Äî which is what, precisely? ‚Äî and that ""man's nature"" includes a *natural* political and economic organization to society. What would that be?

Workers had occupied roughly fifty factories by 16 May, and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day and then ten million, or roughly two-thirds of the French workforce, on strike the following week.*

The Church began sending thousands of missions into China only after the imperial government was forced to sign a number of one-sided treaties with Western powers in the 19th century, after losing the Opium Wars and left with tens of thousands of British, French, and American ([yes, American](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Siege_of_Peking,_Boxer_Rebellion.jpg)) troops occupying commercial and strategic centers in China up until the downfall of the imperial government. 

It's known in China as the ""century of humiliation"", because for over a hundred years, colonial powers in China openly ransacked ancient Chinese cultural sites, sending sacred artifacts and priceless treasures off to Europe. The Church was directly complicit and an active participant in colonization, excluding Chinese people from rising in the clergy, preaching the cultural, moral, and physical inferiority of Chinese people (clearly in dire need of civilizing), and declaring the Virgin Mary ""Queen of China"". Countries like France also declared the Catholic Church in China a ""protectorate"", sanctioning their military occupations of important trading cities like Shanghai without Beijing's consent. 

It shouldn't be a surprise that the communists argued against collaborationist feudalism and western imperialism a lot more than bourgeois capitalism. The communist party represented much more than communism, it argued for national liberation and sovereignty for the Chinese people. The impact of colonization in China is still powerful in the public imagination, and there's even a Jackie Chan movie where he plays a reverse Indiana Jones, stealing back Chinese artifacts from Europe that were looted in the 1860s.

219,"Socialist governments have always placed education as a high priority (a universal right), perhaps one of the reasons why revolutions are successful in the first place. In Russia, China, and Cuba, it was the revolutionaries who took on massive illiteracy -- not just for men, but women too.

And after they were overthrown, what did we see? 

The USSR sent the first satellite, first man, and first woman into space. China has become the world's largest manufacturing power, representing more than 22% of humanity's production of physical goods. And Cuba has become the first country to develop vaccines for cancer and a cure for mother-to-child transmissions of HIV and syphillis. 

These countries aren't perfect, but these are accomplishments of dedicated education, not fear.

Here's a statistic: [60.2% of male voters chose OXI. 62.3% of female voters chose OXI.](http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/2015/07/email-from-greek-voter-with-no-dreams.html)

And this nonsense claim that the election ""*wasn't* about the drachma, *was* about the bailout"" -- goes in complete contradiction with what voters were actually talking about (ever heard public discourse?). Of course people would *prefer* to stay in the Eurozone. Of course they would *prefer* a nice comfortable change into a better future. 

But they were *willing to take the risk* of the harder path. That's what they *voted on*. **And there is a universe of difference between filling out a survey versus voting on a national election which they explicitly viewed as the future of their nation** and -- even more -- Europe. That was what the election was about. Or do you need to reread every Tsipras speech calling the referendum [""the future of the country?""](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/06/tsipras-speech-referendum-bailout-troika/)

Your entire argument is based on the empty claim that the Greek people didn't check a [box saying ""OXI""](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Greek_bailout_referendum-ballot_paper.jpg/640px-Greek_bailout_referendum-ballot_paper.jpg). As if they weren't [crying OXI through the streets](http://xcdn.revolution-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/CJArQBgVEAAA2fo.jpg?iv=20). As if they weren't [blasting OXI across the web.](http://i.imgur.com/orMNEgM.png) There is zero equivocation: the rejection of the Troika was absolute, and it was all-defying. You're pushing an argument based entirely on denial.

And in the hopes that maybe you actually have a heart, here's some actual Greek people explaining **what the election was actually about**.

&gt;*George Hampsas, a 22-year-old mechanical engineering student at the National Technical University of Athens, said his vote of ""no"" will be a vote of confidence in Greece.*

&gt;*Bulletin boards around his campus are filled with advertisements for jobs in Germany, England and Dubai -- but never in Greece, he said. He believes voting ""yes"" for more austerity would do little for Greece's job growth. And he wants to build his career in his home country rather than be part of his generation's brain drain.*

&gt;*""'No' is not an easy answer, but with 'yes' we are doomed,"" Hampsas said. ""At least with a strong 'no' there will be a crack of light in the window, a possibility for a future.""*

...

&gt;*Twenty-four-year-old Apostolia Gkika, who is unemployed and finished her master's degree last year, said she will cast her ""no"" vote in favor of ""dignity and solidarity.""*

&gt;*""I will fight for that,"" she said, adding that austerity created poverty in Greece and other European nations that suffered during the crisis. ""We are part of a wave that is trying to change Europe. It will catch on in Spain and Portugal and other countries.""*

...

&gt;*Like so many other Millennials, Georganta feels her life has been stalled by Greece's seven-year financial crisis. She views Sunday's referendum as a chance to challenge the institutions controlling the terms of Greek debt relief -- or, as she put it, ""to take our fate into our own hands.""*

&gt;*""Our future is unsure,"" said Georganta, who can't afford to move out of her parents' home despite the long hours she works as a hotel receptionist. ""Everyone I know is taking antidepressant pills. I will vote no, for dignity and democracy.""*",2015-07-17 08:19:25+00:00,ct6cxen,19,t1_ct6cnxo,994,socialism
247,"You haven't answered any of those questions. You haven't explained why polls should have more weight than an election with 70% of the nation's turnout. You haven't explained why the polls were stunningly inaccurate in all media coverage leading up to the elections - the baffled expressions of news journalists everywhere. 

So I ask - how can exit polls matter more than the actual election? How many people participated in these polls - versus in the election? And if the riots are in direct alignment with the results of the referendum - i.e. people saying ""we don't want the Troika's proposal"" outraged at the government capitulating and *accepting it* - why would the polls be *more* relevant? Where are the indications that these riots are somehow deviating again *from the majority of Greek voters* and what they voted *against*? They are carrying OXI banners. Are you saying in less than a week the entire Greek country changed their minds? And the evidence of that is...? Apart from unfounded character assassinations of [protesters](https://i.imgur.com/OaYAgcm.png), I mean.

And I'm not sure if that last sentence is ironic or sarcastic, given the fact Maersk, an international shipping company, is now prepared to *buy the ports* in the cities of Piraeus and Thessaloniki, now on sale per Tsipras' plans. 

Anyhow. This has been my point the entire time. That both you, and the Syriza government, are in blithe contradiction with what the entire Greek country voted for, and had decided on.

and when an investment goes south, loses its value, or is no longer producing income -- the investor takes the hit. the bank loses money -- or rather the loans it held as assets lose value, and suddenly the bank is in a panic to sell off the shitty loans to someone else or otherwise be left holding nothing. this was the subprime mortgage crisis, when every bank thought it could trade shitty loans until they realized they'd lent too much and people weren't going to be able to pay them back. 

why so many unable to pay en masse? many reasons, but most often cited are neoliberal policies: outsourcing, deregulation, privatization, etc. you've heard of the stagnant wage and all the jobs disappearing.

425,"Bernie Sanders is radically and fundamentally different from Paul, though they're both popular and not part of the two-party groupthink (oh wait Paul I see you registered Republican...not that you sold out, but anyway...)

Ron Paul spoke to people who feared the government would take their guns and censor their witless internet comments and make rich people pay taxes for the poor. These people are a middle class people. Sure, they have Tea Party rallies and brandish their $500 guns. But at the end of the day, they drive home in their minivans and live a life of comfort and inconvenience and routine.

Bernie Sanders is speaking to people who work below minimum wage. He is speaking to people who walk take trains passing hollowed out stores and rusting factories every day. They go to janitorial jobs in sixty story office towers, pushing strollers and little children for people they barely know instead of their own, getting just another burn while churning out who knows how many burgers, though every seventh is roughly the price of his hourly wage.

These are people who will stand in the middle of highways and block traffic because they are tired of being killed. They will bring riot cops to the McDonald's world headquarters, and get arrested in the hundreds, because they believe that they can win. These are people who risked default, who refused to pay back their federal student debts to the government because they know like all of us that *$1.3 trillion* is too damn high. They face tear gas in their eyes, LRADs and flash bangs in their ears, being fired the next day at work, and how many of us can say the same?

Yet many of us have found stories of these events, crises and rebellions in our own lives. Even if we live far removed from these breakouts, we cannot help but read the headline, share the word, feel some pain or shock or discomfort. We can see ourselves in people who are afraid, who are hurt, and angry, and‚Äîin a truly material way‚Äîfighting to survive. These are people with no more money, and too much debt. They have no property, no protections, no power‚Äîand they have nothing left to lose.

Bernie Sanders is a real contender. All he has to do is speak the truth, and more people than the Democrats might think will be listening and reading those headlines.

And I think more people than we might expect will choose‚Äîbehind the curtains of the ballot box, wondering in those final moments before the future, taking in all the history to pass in their life‚Äîthat perhaps they will throw fear to the wind, and check the square for what they truly, deeply, rightfully believe they are worth.

The Red Estelada was designed in the 1970s and explicitly represents the leftist-socialist movement for independence in Catalonia -- originally adopted by the National Liberation Socialist Party during their splintering from the Marxist Unification Movement, but since used by many other leftists. 

The major difference between the typical Estelada and the Red Estelada is that the leftists wanted not just Catalonian independence from Spain, but a republic of the Catalan countries. These include Catalan-speaking territories owned by France, Italy, and Andorra, not just Spanish Catalonia. 

There are a lot of murals and graffiti artworks, in Barcelona and in Belfast of the Red Estelada. Belfast and Derry, both situated in British-owned North Ireland, are known for these murals.

* [Derry](http://www.indymedia.ie/attachments/jul2007/catire1.jpg)
* [Belfast](http://imgur.com/OwOCkPi.jpg)
* [Belfast](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3589/3570868612_d47ab8978c.jpg)

Notice these are all Red Esteladas. And a lot of murals (well, illegal graffiti) are put up across Barcelona and Spanish Catalonia by the Maulets, an antifascist leftist youth movement demanding a socialist republic of the Catalan countries.

Why the Red Estelada in Ireland? A big part of it is because Ireland has a long history of essentially colonization under Britain, an English-speaking monarchy subjugating Irish-speaking people (Spain:Catalonia). Irish independence and anti-imperialist struggle is big in Ireland, and especially strong in Northern Ireland, which is still a British territory. 

Whether or not Catalonia has a good chance of becoming both independent and socialist, I don't know. But in almost all cases, popular liberation movements are led from the left. They're the people who'll hold that banner the longest. They usually move democratic power down from a distant central authority to a more local level, and make financial leaders worried about redistribution of resources.

That is pretty much the case with Scottish independence, where Scottish people tired of a conservative London government just wanted out from the UK system, UK austerity, and run their own affairs democratically. The Labour Party was terrified they'd lose half their seats in Parliament if Scotland left.

Though in Spain the new left wing and massively popular party PODEMOS seems poised to take power in Spain just as SYRIZA did in Greece, and who knows what they'll do about Catalonia. Their leader Pablo Iglesias has said he supports their right to self-determination. ",2015-06-26 09:50:43+00:00,csj8xlv,2,t1_csj2pbn,20337,vexillology
