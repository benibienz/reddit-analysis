So I feel like you could definitely save some money (I.e. get a cheaper monitor that runs at 75hz or something instead of 144, cheaper keyboard and mouse, etc.) and upgrade as mentioned. But it depends on what you want in the end - a more powerful and future proof build with a cheaper monitor, etc, or a nicer monitor and peripherals and a slightly less powerful build 

EDIT: For example, here is my build. It has a mechanical keyboard, decent gaming mouse, extra case fans, LED strip, 21:9 monitor, twice the RAM of yours, twice the HDD storage, better PSU, etc. The only things lacking are the wireless card adapter and headphones. But as someone who records and produces music, you can get much better headphones for much less; but it depends on whether you want a headset for communication while gaming or solely for listening.

I know this is around 200 pounds over budget, but it is worth every extra penny. Your PSU was not a good choice; for EVGA you should go with a g2 series. RAM could be dropped back down to 8gb, but 16gb will be better if you're running two monitors and higher end games possibly.

Also, to save some money on a case, try the NZXT S340/340 Elite. Both should be less than the R5, but they (IMO) look better and have a window.

Consider that if you have say, all black components, and run a red LED strip inside, it will look about the same as if you had red/black components and ran a red LED. I am not saying don't pay the premium for color schemes, I am just saying that most people only seem to care about it for the first few weeks then the cool factor kind of wears off. I mean, look at it like this: for the amount you are paying for the aesthetic, you could upgrade to a GTX 1080 instead.

113,"I agree with r/TheMadDoc. For anything close to $1750 USD you should be getting a 6700k/1080 combo.

MOBO could be cheaper and get the same performance. 32GB of RAM is only really needed if you are doing 3D rendering. Otherwise, 16GB should be more than enough. You probably don't need a full tower case. Mid tower is usually more than enough unless you are doing like dual CPU/GPU setups. Take a look at NZXT s340/s340 Elite. They are highly recommended. For the PSU, try to go for a G2 instead. It may be a ~$20 upcharge but the better warranty and such is worth it. Why do you need a soundcard? That is really only for things like recording, but most USB interfaces work better than a soundcard. 

Lastly, this is definitely personal preference, but I feel like you could get a cheaper monitor with the same specs/performance as well. Shop around a little.

115,"It depends on what you are looking for. For appearance? Sure, you can spend a little more. But you can get the same spec build (same CPU, GTX 1070, storage and RAM amounts, etc.) for under $1200. The main difference in you wont have SLI/RAID support on the MOBO. 

But if you are ok with that and are not partial to a specific aesthetic, you can make it cheaper. Here is a build more similar to mine (better PSU, basically the same GPU, same CPU, similar CPU Cooler, same amount of RAM, etc.):

164,"Thanks! My current build now reflects the above, with the exception that I picked the Black/Blue case and switched the RAM to the Blue ones instead (I prefer blue). 

But I do have three questions -

Is the CPU fan on the MOBO? And would I get any benefit from picking up an extra CPU cooler? Or is it unnecessary since I won't be overclocking?

Is there a cheaper power supply I could get that would be the same in terms of quality? I mean, if it's only 550w 80+ gold, I feel like I could probably knock $20 off without losing too much reliability; I just don't know what to replace it with. If not, that is cool too since you already knocked over $100 off of the price!

179,"I agree with this. There are two lines of thought about 6 (3 on each side) lane highways. 

The first. The middle lane is the ""driving"" lane, while the left and right lanes are ""exiting/turning"" lanes. This has less validity and is less popular, but is worth mentioning. 

The second, and more popular thought, is that each lane represents a speed ""zone"". The intention is that the right lane is for vehicles traveling under the speed limit, i.e. semis governed to 65 driving in 70mph zones. The middle lane is meant for people driving the speed limit. The left lane is meant for passing, but more for emergency vehicles than people speeding. The easiest way to look at it is like this (in a 70mph zone):

| 71+mph | 70 mph | &lt;70mph |

In reality, it has shifted. In a 70, it's more like this:

| 76+ mph | 75 mph | &lt; 75 mph |

Basically, we have shifted the ""speed limit lane"" to being the ""only 5 over lane"" and adjusted the left and right lanes accordingly.

I would go with wine even if the prices were reversed, because a bottle of wine will make me happier anyway. 

Although, the best option in my opinion is something like Admiral Nelsons spiced rum. You pay a little more ($1.37 or so per ounce of pure alcohol) but it lasts a **long** time. Considering the alcohol content, if you drank the equivalent amount of pure alcohol, it would take about 5 times longer to empty the rum than the beer, and about 2.5 times longer than the wine.

For recording, you basically need two things - an interface and a DAW. Something like a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 with Abelton Live Lite. 

This allows you to run your guitar into the interface and into your computer, then run an amp simulation in the DAW and record. 

Peraonally, I recommend one step further. Buy a Mic and Mic stand (or even better, two) and now you run the mics into the interface and record a guitar amp directly. This makes it much easier to capture your actual sound rather than a decent one you found in an amp simulator. 

I bought a recording bundle last October. Scarlett 2i2 with Live Lite, MXL 550/551 Mic set and all needed cables. It works well. Granted I'm not gonna get like, professional studio quality. But it works very well for what it is. Micing an amp stays very true to the actual sound.

First, don't expect to play a lot. I don't know if it's my school or every school, but you just won't have time to play most days other than may be a half hour or so. 

Second, dont limit your setup because you are in a dorm. When I was prepping before coming last year, I sold my 212 all tube amp because of space issues.

Lastly, if you ever want to be in a band, make sure your equipment can handle it. I've been trouble finding people to play with, but if I did, I would not be able to anyway due to my current setup limitations.

Edit: basically what it comes down to is this:

I have a lowest acceptable price in mind, A. 

There is a shipping cost, B. 

There is your offer, C. 

For me to accept, (C - B) has to be greater than or equal to A, plus or minus a few dollars. 

Made up example: say I want at least $500 for the strat. You offer $500. I can accept that, if you pay for shipping. 

Say you offer $550. I'll pay for shipping then, because I'll end up with over that $500 goal.

AFAIK, the drops are mutually exclusive. Meaning that if you don't get it the first 100 times, that doesn't increase your chance for the next 100. Even a 1% chance realistically can take 500+ kills no problem, because that's how stats work. 

Its actually easier to calculate the chance you *don't* get a drop after x kills. 

Assume again the drop rate is 1% to make the math easy. All you do is take the chance of not getting a drop, and raise it to the power of kills, ie (1-.01)^n, where n is number of kills. 

Here, if we did say 250 kills, we would have .99^250 ~ .08, so after 250 kills you only have an 8% chance of *not* getting a drop during those 250 kills.

Eventually you run a marathon. That first 10? No biggie really. That's second 10? Pretty hard. That last 6ish? You'll feel like you're dying. Until you run a marathon a month. Or a marathon a week. Then you'll be able to that 26 and still walk to your car afterwards - or maybe just walk home.

5.56/.223 is MUCH cheaper ammo. 7.62/.308 is literally twice as expensive on the LOW end for ammo; TulAmmo .223 is $0.20 CPR and TulAmmo .308 is $0.40 CPR. Once you get into the nicer ammo varieties its not much better. 308 Superformance Hornady is close to $1.50 a round, and Superformance .223 is around $1.20 a round. That is a lower relative cost, but the absolute is higher.

Also, 5.56 is effective up to around 600m (conventionally). A ""good"" accuracy is considered around 8-10"" at 500yds for a standard AR using cheap ammo as mentioned. Using a better ammo such as the Superformance should be able to net around 4-6"" at 500. 

I would like to be at around .8MOA or less at 500 consistently with decent (read as: midgrade) ammo. I simply won't have room to go past 500 anyway, so the extra distance capability of the .308 doesn't interest me. If I were purely looking for distance and long range shooting, I would buy something like a Remington 700 VTR and some decent glass. 

Realistically, I LOVE the idea of having a sub MOA AR capable of keeping that at 500m+, but it is impractical. I don't have a 500m range anywhere close.

Higher than or lower than 45° will decrease range. The coriolis effect will matter here if shooting east/west as well. 

A 5.56x45mm round (the most common used by US Armed Forces) can travel several miles if fired at 45°. However it is nearly impossible to be accurate at this point since the wind, earth spin, etc will vary from shot to shot.

584,"I have had this argument many times. 

I claim, ""Women make less because they focus on field that make less money. When I graduated homeschool, if you asked the females what they were doing, it was pretty universal - the ""average"" female students were going to school for things like nursing, teaching, child care and development, etc. The ""above average"" female students were going into Pre-Med, Pre-Law, Engineering, etc.

We hear often that feminists claim women are ""under-represented in STEM fields."" Is this true? Yes and no. Do women make up approximately 50% of the STEM workforce as they do the population? No. Is that evidence of a misrepresentation? No. If you are a female and you want the discrepancy to disappear, then major in a STEM field instead of WGS or something like that. 

The average feminist then argues, ""Well women have a harder time finding a job in STEM fields since, from a young age, we are told that doctors are men, nurses are ladies; scientists are men, secretaries are women; etc."" What that argument clearly states and then fails to bring up is the fact that it IS a double edged sword. Note that, in the paraphrased and generalised feminist quote I just referenced, I said, ""nurses are ladies.""

There is a definite negative stigma on make nurses. Our media capitalised on it - think of how many movies there are that bash the idea of a male nurse. In Yes Man, for example, a male nurse applies for a loan for a Ducatti street bike to make him seem more manly since everyone makes fun of him for being a male nurse. Men are told from a young age the same things - doctors are men, nurses are ladies. Just as there is negative pressie on females leading them to avoiding being doctors, there is negative pressie on males making them avoid the lower paying jobs. This is also true in teaching. Most male teachers teach history, physical education, math or science courses. We usually have a stigma about male techers in other subjects. For example, Home Economics - the class where you learn to cook, see, take care of a baby, etc. I have never heard of a male Home Ec teacher. Why? Because a high school probably wouldn't hire one. There's a negative stigma against it.

Personally, if I had $600, I would probably buy a used MIM strat (no more than $400, and the older they are, the better chance you have of getting a good deal). I have a 91 MIM, which would sell for $300-350, but it's a Holy Grail. 

Assuming you can get one for $350, that leaves $250 for an amp. Again, the Bugera v5 is a nice choice (depending on the style you want to play). Solid state amps are fine too, I just think starting out an amp should be simple. You don't want to get distracted by onboard effects and modeling, etc. 

The best thing to do is check your local Facebook music buy/sell pages, then craigslist. There are a lot of great deals.

629,"In my experience, Fenders have fantastic necks in general. I've played everything from $100 Bullet Squiers to $2k+ vintage Gibsons to Ibanez Prestiges. While I prefer a thin profile like the wizard, the Fender necks are always my favorite. My three favorite necks ever (in order) are my 91 Strat, a Fender Modern Player Tele Plus (actually made in Asia) and a 2005 Stratocaster Deluxe (American). Followed closely by, believe it or not, a Bullet Squier strat. They just work so well. Everything flows super easily, even with old, nasty strings. 

Edit: however, as I have mentioned in previous comments on other posts, the early MiMs were special (1989-1992ish). Many of the necks and bodies were made in Cali, then shipped to Mexico where they were finished (final sanding, paint, fretting, leveling, wiring, etc). So it's a Us/Mexico bastard child, as if Leo had a Mexican mistress. That may be part of the playability factor. ",2015-12-28 02:02:57+00:00,cydcyeo,3.0,t1_cyd98k3,6790.0,guitarpedals

654,"I get so tired of these posts. Like seriously, any guitar can play any genre. 

Like Telecasters/Stratocasters and metal? Go for it. I had a Squier Tele that could seriously dish out some heavy riffs with the right amp settings. My 91 Strat will sing with some heavy gain in drop d. 

Like Ibanez RGs and jazz? Go for it. An RG can easily play jazz, whether it's an HHS, HH, or HS - and the Floyd Rose style bridge (if applicable) can actually help get some cool jazz sounds. 

Like Jazzmasters and Iron Maiden? Go for it. The guitar can handle as much gain as your amp dishes out. 

Like Les Pauls and Surf Rock? Just go for it. 

Edit: seriously though, my recommendation would be an Ibanez, either RG or S series. They're so good for everything. The cleans on the neck pickups are nice and full, so things like Jazz, ambient music and even church band music are super nice sounding. Put on a little OD, and instant blues. The bridge humbucker has enough output to handle everything from a light distortion like many bands in the 70s/80s used, up to hard rock, and metal/grunge territory. It it's HSS or HS, or HSH, the bridge-mid position is perfect for ""chicken-pickin"" country licks. And the edge tremolo systems stay in tune wonderfully.

1) tune the low E to pitch. 

2) tune the A to pitch. 

Repeat these a lot. Eventually, the low E and A will both be in tune. Now, do this again, adding D. Tune D, then E and A. Repeat. Eventually, all three will be in tune. Add G. Repeat. Add B. Repeat.

I have decided on the 2i2 as an interface. It is simple, yet has all of the functionality that I need - plus it's not very expensive. 

I am not sure if I want to go the Shure route, however. Browsing Reverb, I found some cool bundles like [this bundle with two mics](https://reverb.com/item/635337-focusrite-scarlett-2i2-interface-mxl-550-551r-mic-stands-2-xlr-20-ft-and-2-stx-115m-cables). I have done some research on the MXL mics in that bundle and they sound really good for the price. And since the 2i2 comes with Abelton Live Lite, I could use that until I get the extra money for Reaper.

Then, change the dist to the level you like. You will have to adjust the level again. Raising gain (distortion) will mean you have to lower the volume a bit to keep that volume. 

If you want a metal tone, put the treble and bass ON THE PEDAL at around 3 o clock and then fine tune. 


Edit: if that's not quite right, you can turn down the mids on the amp a bit, and turn up the treble and bass. I wouldn't turn gain up too much on the amp, or you won't have a clean sound.

834,"Distortion pedal-

So many options. For ""not too expensive"" I would go for a Metal Muff with Top Boost, a RAT, a Custom Badass 78 or, if you're feeling really cheap, a DS1 (only like $50 new, can be had used for less than $30). All are under $100 new. 

The Metal Muff will probably be the best for a super high gain sound. The RAT is a great pedal with a lot of versatility. The CB78 is a ""classic rock"" pedal, but it has super high saturation and the crunch Button is intense. 

The DS1, while not really a ""metal"" pedal per say, can work. And it has that nostalgia since everyone in the 80s or 90s used one. 

Looper - well, the ditto mini and jam man (small one) can both be had for under $100, and the BOSS RC3 for not too much more. The larger Jam Man is more comparable to the BOSS RC20xl/RC30, and the standard ditto is about the same (more streamlined for looping, so has less ""features"". Those are closer to the $150+ range for used (BOSS, not sure about JM). Personally I would buy a used rc30. I had one and it was nice. 99 save tracks, with up to 99 overdubs on each one, with a mic input and stereo ins and outs. ",2015-08-11 12:46:18+00:00,ctz2ont,1.0,t3_3gkijy,16346.0,Guitar

With the BD2, bright amps can sound harsh. It's a great boost, or if you have a really beefy sounding amp it's fantastic. But I just find it to be bad with bright amps.

And you're totally right about the supplies. Whenever I go to the store, I try to pick up a few things each visit as opposed to buying it all at once. For example, today I bought 5 of the single subject college ruled notebooks at Walmart for $0.17 a piece.

When I looked as pushpins, paperclips, etc, it was all around $2 or more. One small box of paperclips will probably last a semester, so I am fine with paying $1/box.

Just for giggles, some things the list recommends (and my naive take on them):

- bedside AND desk lamp (who has a dorm room big enough that the desk light won't double?)

- drying rack for laundry (again, space)

- TV and DVD player. Now, I completely understand the TV. But the DVD player seems antiquated since everyone will have a laptop.

- Ethernet cord ""for corded internet connection"". I suppose it may still be necessary at some places, but most schools just use wifi.

- lightbulbs. To me, that seems like something that would be such a small issue that, if one is needed, it would be better to go buy them rather than just try to store them.

- portable speakers AND audio equipment. Why both? Is there even a difference?

- mattress pad, 2 sets of sheets, 2 blankets, and a comforter. I can understand two sets of sheets. I can understand a comforter OR blanket, but not two blankets and a comforter.

951,"Start with improv. 

Learn the blues scale up and down the neck and then play over a blues shuffle backing track. It's probably the easiest improv there is. 

Then work your way up. Learn new scales. Go up to rock ballads (slow rock songs), country, then more upbeat rock songs, then some more classic metal (think Metallica), maybe even Jazz. Eventually, you'll know enough scales and such that you can solo in any genre. 

At this point you will be able to solo in fast paced metal. The problem is that you may not be able to continue to keep up. So, you practice speed. Then try again. Practice playing the scales as fast as possible, but keeping the musicality of the scales. It will help to practice with no distortion or gain, as you'll learn to be more precise and smooth. Eventually, you make it to the level you want. 

Edit: also, if you never have been, try joining a band. It may not help you learn to shred so to say, but playing with people is much different from by yourself or with backing tracks. It teaches you things you would never learn alone. 

For example, late in my sophomore year of high school I joined my first band. We played at the end of the year and I couldn't solo at all, especially improv. Over summer we had practice once or twice a week, from 3 hours to 9 hours. We would practice a song, then just do a jam to improv. By the end of the summer, I was belting out blistering solos that were 5+ mins long and kept crowds interested (my favorite was playing over Black by Pearl Jam). 

Then the band broke up. And my playing went downhill. I stopped improvising as much, and I am probably just now passing where I was then (this is two years later). ",2015-07-04 00:42:42+00:00,csrj6xr,1.0,t3_3c1upu,2523.0,Guitar

[here](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Telecaster-tele-Control-Plate-Wired-Fully-Loaded-Chrome-ON-SALE-/321710941513?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item4ae7776549) is an example.

Everything else should be fine. If you want a new jack, they're cheap and easy to find online. I would suggest getting one while you're at it. [here](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Output-Oval-Jackplate-Jack-For-Guitar-Electic-Guitar-Parts-Replacement-/251999368501?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item3aac553535). If you want new pickups, I would suggest something cheap and simple like [these](http://www.ebay.com/itm/telecaster-pick-ups-lipstick-high-output-single-coil-/201379851342?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item2ee32cac4e). Might not be the best, but they will work until you can decide whether or not you want to upgrade it further.
For the most part, that is it part wise. You can be a lot of cleaning yourself. Don't be afraid to take some sandpaper or steel wool to it. The relic look is a big trend now anyway. 

On top of the cost of parts, you will either need to know how to install and wire everything or pay someone to do it. I can't give you an estimate on that, as it varies by area. Around here, a tech would charge about $30 an hour to do it. Would take 2-3 hours max, so we will say $75.

edit: this can be a $100 project or a $1000 project. It all depends on what you want to put into it. You can put all high quality, made in USA parts in if you want, but that has a premium. Also, don't be afraid to order cheap things from China. It is a cheap guitar that needs to be in working condition. The part will take a while but they will work fine. Just make sure things like the bridge will fit. notice it has three holes for screws in the back. Naturally, one with four holes wont work well..",2015-07-01 06:12:44+00:00,csofop5,1.0,t3_3bpxum,3637.0,Guitar

You'll put $300 in pickups and then be satisfied for another year or two. Then you'll think, ""you know. I want some locking tuners."" Another $50-$100.

A semi hollow is probably a good idea. But there's no reason to buy a Gibson ES if you're not sure about what to do. Why not try out something like an Epiphone Dot or Casino? That way if you end up hating it and it doesn't suit your needs, you only paid $300-$600 instead of $1800.

It's important to remember the guitar doesn't make the player. 

I couldn't make a $13000 Gibson Custom Shop Joe B. LP sound as good as someone like Paul Gilbert playing a $100 bullet Strat. It's the player.

If you want heavier tone for metal (I didn't really read all the comments I just skimmed), I would go with a Peavey 5150 combo. If that's out of your budget, a Bugera 6260 or 6262 will work fantastically. ",2015-06-23 15:25:04+00:00,csfyrg8,9.0,t1_csfmanq,36045.0,Guitar
1024,"Ask him, but do it cleverly. 


Like ask him to play guitar for you one day. Then say something like, ""is that the same pick you always use?""

""Why do you use that one?""

""So do picks come in a lot of different thicknesses or something then?""

""So what do you use? I would think thinner = better. Is that how it is?""

You'll get all the info you need and he will just think you're curious about guitar and picks in general. ",2015-06-20 15:44:42+00:00,cscyaxj,1.0,t3_3ah5fa,44255.0,Guitar
1025,"A compressor of some sort. A Dyna or Super would be preferable. I currently use a Joyo three knob. 

A Boss BD2, because hell yes. 

And a dd7. 

This is of course assuming the amp has reverb and a decent eq section. ",2015-06-19 22:48:16+00:00,cscdevy,1.0,t3_3afbin,18164.0,Guitar

1027,"I disagree. 

I have a Yamaha APX500 (or maybe it's CPX?). They are around $300 new and are absolutely fantastic. I've played Martins, Taylor's, etc in the sub and over $1k range and I prefer my Yamaha. 

Let's also not forget Seagull. They have some good acoustics for less than $600 for sure, especially used. ",2015-06-18 13:40:10+00:00,csao233,2.0,t1_csagar1,26462.0,Guitar
1028,"Usually leftie guitarists are left handed in general, but even a lot of left handed guitarist play the ""right"" way. 

I don't think I've ever known of a right handed guitarist playing lefty, aside from people like MAB playing both simultaneously. 

You may just be ambidextrous. If that is the case, stick to right handed - there are so many more guitars and options out there for righties. ",2015-06-17 16:27:44+00:00,cs9ow8h,1.0,t3_3a6eva,466.0,Guitar
