Of course.

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

Gaming, coding, maybe some 3D work but nothing serious.

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, FPS, game settings)**

60fps at Ultra on AAA titles with mods.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

I don't really have one. Obviously cheaper is better, but I would like to soft cap at around $1500.

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

- For the cooler I plan on actually going with the H7, but since it is listed for $99.99 now, I picked the be quiet! as a replacement in case the price doesn't come down by the time I buy parts.

- I may or may not go with the S340 Elite in white if it isn't too much extra and such. 

- I elected to add the case fans and do a positive pressure system as opposed to liquid cooling. This is pretty much a done deal; I will be overclocking, but I don't want to screw with liquid cooling since the air will be plenty, and benefits the GPU etc as well.

- I originally was going to do a single 21:9 monitor at 1080p, ($179 LG) but decided a dual 16:9 setup would be a better use of the 1070s capabilities. I do not plan on going to 1440p anytime soon, but maybe if I see a good deal in r/buildapcsales in a few months. 

- I plan on doing a dual boot Windows/Linux install. I already have windows 10 pro. Both OS's will be on the SSD. Don't know if this will affect anything, but it shouldn't. 

- I plan on adding an LED strip to the case using a spare MOLEX connector and some simple wiring, but I haven't included this since it will not be a right-away thing.

I installed a partition of elementary OS on my laptop yesterday, as it is a spare, and I wanted to start messing around with Linux. Elementary seemed to be heavily MacOS influenced, which I liked, so I went with it. 

When I got everything installed, I tried the Epiphany browser that comes default, but it wouldn't load anything on wifi. So, I plugged in the wire and it worked. I thought it must be the browser since I was connected to my wifi, so I opened up the terminal and ran the command to install firefox. It was installed. Then I turned off the wired connection and tried wifi again with Firefox. Nothing. 

It is strange because it explicitly says I AM connected to wifi; I even get a speed. Last night, it was around 2.5mbs download and today it is a staggeringly low 4kbs. However, when I go to the Windows side, I get solid speeds of 3mbs+. Granted that isn't very fast, but it is able to load pages and whatnot. 

I made a post in r/buildmeapc as troubleshooting hoping someone would know. They recommended [This Guide](https://mylinuxevolution.wordpress.com/elementary-os-loki-post-installation-tutorials/). I woke up this morning and followed the guide straight away, installing the mentioned applications, and running updates. When I got to the ""Install Graphics Drivers"" I was told to do as if it said ""Install Wifi Drivers"", as everything should be the same. I cannot find wifi drivers listed in any of the tabs; the only proprietary driver listed was for my AMD CPU's microcode firmware. I went ahead and opted to use it.

So, where do I go from here in order to get my wifi to work?

So I recently upgraded my laptop to Windows 10 to test my companies new image with various programs. I thought one of the easiest ways to do this would be downloading Steam and playing some games. I wanted to go through the entire Red Faction series as well, so I thought I would download them all. They were the first games I ever bought on Steam.

So, the RF installation goes fine and I play for a few hours. Then I start to remember how buggy RF is. So, I download Pure Faction - a 3rd party patch, similar to something like Fallout Fixt. I have used it before. 

However, for some reason, I cannot get it to work. Kind of. PF launches a window that lets you adjust settings, i.e. resolution and such, and then has a ""launch game"" button within it. I can get the window to come up, but pressing ""launch game"" does nothing regardless of how I set the options. I have watched youtube videos (Windows 10) on the installation to make sure I did everything correctly and all is as it should be. So, I have two main questions. 

First, does anyone here still play the original Red Faction and use Pure Faction, that could maybe point me to what is happening and how to fix it?

Second, does anyone know if this would be something to do with my companies image, as it is connected to an active directory and has specific group policy, or just windows 10? I don't know WHY this would matter, since I can play Steam games (including RF standalone) without any issues. 

I just really want to play a non-buggy version of the game and I appreciate any help.

This amp is *killer*. Everything I set this amp to sounds absolutely amazing. 

The cleans are super nice - you can get everything from Vox chime to a warm boutique to classic Fender out of this. Running my SG through it sounds fantastic for everything from country to jazz to metal. 

The drive channel is perfect. If I want bluesy, I get it. If I want higher gain stuff, I get it. It won't out any Smashing Pumpkins type wall of gain without pedals, but really all you need to gig is the amp and footswitch. 

I paid $385 for it. Free shipping, with a cover as well! It doesn't have the original speaker; a previous owner switched it out for a Marshall ""Gold Back"", which is apparently what the DSL401s had? It sounds just as good as the Celestion 70/80 that is stock, just EQ'd a little differently. Overall, I'm in love. 

I'm moving this weekend, but hopefully next week I will find time to set the recording stuff up and sample some tones for you guys.

I'm looking to build a new pedal board setup and I need a new board. 

I'm looking for something that is the same size as a Pedaltrain Classic 2 (24""x12.5"") that isn't a PT. 

I would like something that is Velcro based like a PT, not like a holeyboard. I also am slightly opposed to flat top boards. I like having all of the cables under the board as opposed to on top of the board. However this is not a total deal breaker. I would prefer a hard case/flight case but a soft case is ok too. I would like the neutrik jacks on the side if possible as well. 

My main issue with the PT is the price. I can afford $150, I just feel like a board and soft case shouldn't cost $150 - and there are definitely cheaper options. For example, I think Gator has a board that is basically an ATA case with a removable top that you can get for around $180. My budget is $200.

It is a mid 90s GR4, as far as I can tell all original. It has SD Hot Rails for the single coils and I'm unsure of what the humbucker is (anyone know?). They all sound absolutel fantastic. It has the original trem and gig bag as well. The neck is the carbon composite, so it is super straight. It plays really well, even with the 8month+ old strings that were on it. The trem unfortunately had to be blocked when I was testing it out, as it needs setup and I couldn't do that in the store. The guitar is in good shape overall. There are some scratches around the tone knob, but that is about it. The wood is checking, which is really cool. It could also use a good cleaning - I see a lemon oil wipe down in the future. As an aside, anyone know what I can use to clean a carbon/graphite/composite fretboard?

Unfortunately I was unable to take it home as I actually didn't pay in full - I just ""reserved"" it as mine. Once I get it home, I'll be sure to include some better pictures and maybe a demo of the pickups.

However, my research ended once I saw the price of the GM models - they easily reach the $4k-6k area, depending on condition and options. I found the Spirit series, but they get pretty ""eh"" reviews so I decided to stay away, simply looking at the brand as a far away dream that may happen one day in the distant future.

Today I was in a music store and saw a Steinberger sitting tucked behind an amp that was on display. I had never seen one in person. I picked it up and it was **fantastic**. HSS setup, with Seymour Duncan pups. Even with the old crap strings, it was super easy to play. I inquired about the price, expecting to laugh at the answer. Long story short, it is available for a mere $799. 

I knew it was not a GM, but I had to find out what it was. After some research, I have found that it is a GR4 made in the Nashville factory prior to the MusicYo takeover (serial TN14400). 

This is a fantastic price for the guitar based on previous similar sales. It isn't the ""true"" Steinberger with the TransTrem and such, but still a great guitar. I was wondering if anyone had experience with the GR series, or any Steinberger guitars.

I am currently a college student in central KY. Some friends and I were talking, and we would love to take a road trip. 

Originally, the plan was to do the Route 50 Coast to Coast trip - start in Ocean City, MD and take US Route 50 to Sacramento. However, after looking at it, I decided this just is not enough for me. Route 50 doesn't take you close to many of the places I want to see, such as Mount Rushmore, the Hoover Dam, Niagra Falls, etc. 

Then I found this: [The Perfect US Road Trip According to Scientists](https://thebolditalic.com/this-is-the-perfect-u-s-road-trip-according-to-scientists-the-bold-italic-san-francisco-66cd5091ed8f#.hz58rwlrm)

This is much better, but it is still lacking. For example, this route doesn't include Nashville, Atlanta, Tuscon, etc. 

So, here is where I need to decide what I can do. Personally, I really want to do a trip mixing both natural landmarks, like the Giant Forest, man-made Natural Landmarks, like Mount Rushmore, and historic cities, such as Fort Lauderdale and Montgomery. The problem is trying to fit all of these in. I know it can be done, but the amount of landmarks and cities in the US to see is simply overwhelming. I started a list, state by state, that mostly just included historical landmarks in cities (such as famous buildings), and in the first 3 states I had nearly 30 places to visit - not including many natural landmarks. 

So, I was wondering if someone could share a map or story of a similar trip they went on, and how satisfied they were. Did you miss things you wish you would have seen? Did you find certain things to be underwhelming compared to what you expected?

For my own trip, the requirements are pretty simple - I want to see as much of the United States as I can. The trip will start next summer (2017), so I have a little over a year to plan. I will have the entire summer (early May to late August, approximately 3.5 months). I plan on mostly camping at different sites or sleeping in the car rather than getting hotel rooms, but because I am starting to plan the trip so early, I will have plenty of time to save money. I should be able to save around $5000, if I seriously need to.

Can anyone help point me in the right direction? Thanks!",travel,Beginning stages of my once in a lifetime trip around the US.,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/4eiw0q/beginning_stages_of_my_once_in_a_lifetime_trip/

For reference, my car is a 2007 Ford Fusion with approx 123k miles on it. It was purchased in 2009/2010, when it had approx 35k miles on it. I believe the belt was last replaced around 50k miles. 

For about a year now, my (serpentine) belt has been squeaking. At first, it rarely happened. I took it to Auto Zone because I simply felt the belt needed replaced, but the technician who helped had a look and said it did not need replaced - ""the problem was not the belt"". They said it shouldn't be a problem. 

Since then the problem has become progressively worse. It is especially loud on days where it is cold and/or rainy, but almost always squeaks when first turning the car on. The longer you drive, the more quiet it becomes. There is also a check engine light on that I assume is due to this. 

After googling some, I have read that newer belts do not physically show signs of wear like the old ones, and that the grooves on the underside may actually be worn. This can apparently cause slipping, squeaking, and incorrect engine check lights/codes. 

So, I have three major questions. 

First, does the problem sound like the belt or not? Second, is this something I can easily fix or should I take it to a car person? Lastly, how much will this cost? I am a semi-broke college student, so I can't afford large amount of money going into my car at the moment (I don't need it to get around, necessarily, as I live on campus).

However, some old band mates and I got together this week to play around. I had the amp around 10 o clock (the equivalent to about 4) most of the time. When everyone else was playing, it was fine. But I noticed when only I played, the sound was really harsh. 

I brought it home and turned it up to (about) that volume. Same thing. For reference I'm using a 91 MIM strat. It's happening on all pickup selections, but especially the bridge. The other pickups, however, seem to have way too much low end if I roll the tone down a little bit. 

I am using a compressor on pretty high settings (sustain maxed, attack around half and level about half) but it's essential to my light drive sound. 

I normally wouldn't worry about it, since I rarely play loud. However, a different friend invited me to play a show with him tonight.

I eat (up to) three meals a day at the cafeteria, for free. And, I know it's not ""technically free"", but it is where I go. I digress that point for a different time. 

Our break officially starts the 19th, though we can leave as soon as we want (this week is finals week, my last one is Friday, so I can't leave). Even if I could leave, I'm not going to. I signed up to work over break at the office I usually work at. I get paid close to time and a half (1.4 times normal pay) and work much more (over 6 weeks of normal work hours in 8 days). The work days are the 21st-23rd and 4th-8th. 

However, there are some costs to go along with this. I have to pay $15/night to stay in a dorm, and I haven't been able to find another place for the break - I've asked all my friends with apartments. I will be staying a total of 10 nights, for $150. My estimated pay for the break is $420. That leaves me with $270. 

The dining services area closes this Friday after dinner. Which means Saturday morning - Thursday morning (I'm leaving Thursday morning) and the 4th-8th, I have to provide all other food. This can obviously become rather expensive if not done correctly. 

So, here's what I do have:

- a car
- a cookie sheet
- a brownie pan
- an oven mitt 
- a spatula 
- a coffee maker and coffee, as well as coffee cups (though no dish soap)

Stores close to me are:

- Dollar Tree (good for cheap cookware)
- Walmart
- Walgreens
- Save A Lot

Driving an extra 15 miles brings me to a slightly larger town, which may have more of a selection. 

I have to move out of my dorm and into another for the duration of break, so I am not sure of the amenities there, though I can assume they have mini fridges in each room, as well as floor/shared ovens, stoves, microwaves and fridges. I can cook decently well. 

I currently have around $100 until New Years, so I can't afford to spend a whole lot on cookware - Walmart has a 5 quart crockpot I've considered for like $15. 

What would you recommend given my situation?

Thanks.

This is just a post based on my own opinions based on personal experience.

We all shop online (or at least browse) for guitar stuff. Whether it be pedals, guitars, amps, strings, etc., most of us have bought stuff from the internet as well, whether through eBay, Reverb.com, or a retail store's website. I want to take a minute to talk about my experiences with four different companies, and why I believe Sweetwater is the best.

First, Guitar Center. A great place - one of my favorite places, actually. Tons of guitars, amps, and pedals to demo until my friends get pissed off and make me leave after playing around for 4 hours. I have bought multiple things from GC - a guitar, a couple of pedals, and strings (actually bought some Super Slinkys at GC in Lexington this past Saturday). What I love about Guitar Center is the brick and mortar locations, the being able to go in and test gear. What I don't like is that it seems like they always have the same stuff - some Fenders of every price range (mostly strats and teles), some Gibsons I can't afford, a few Epiphone Les Pauls and SGs, and some Squier strats and teles as well; occasionally, you'll find a wall of decently priced shred guitars, like Ibanez and Jackson. What you don't find is what upsets me, however. I have been to 4 Guitar Centers in the last 8 weeks or so - Columbus, Dayton, Cincinnati and Lexington. Out of those four stores, I saw one (1) Jazzmaster - a Squier J Mascis. I would love a Jazzmaster, but I can't find any to demo at GC. They have the normal stuff, but the ""popular-but-not-as-popular-as-teles-strats-LPs-and-SGs"" stuff is more rare. Also, due to the brick and mortar locations, sales taxes are always charged - it's cheaper to go home and order a guitar from a different company, especially since most offer free shipping. Guitar Center just recently began offering free shipping, as far as I am aware. Also, I find their online store to be sub-par compared to other retailers. It just looks outdated, like it belongs in 2000, and I am supposed to be viewing it using dial-up and Windows 98.

Next up is one of Guitar Center's main competitors - Sam Ash. I will state that I have never actually bought anything from Sam Ash, but I went into SA Columbus and I fell in love. It has everything I love about Guitar Center and more. What more? More everything. Those weird guitars GC doesn't seem to keep in stock? Sam Ash does. I was able to find every guitar I had seen online and wanted to try, even a Squier Baritone Jazzmaster - which is pretty abnormal for most stores to carry. They also have pedalboards set up, so that you can plug in any guitar and play through tons of pedals at the same time. Want to see how this guitar would sound with a Custom Badass '78 Distortion, a Phase 90, a Dyna Comp and a CryBaby? It's already set up for you to try. So I definitely prefer SA over GC.

Next is a company I am loyal to, but still doesn't quite match up to Sweetwater - Musician's Friend. I have ordered quite a bit from here, and most of my strings are purchased through their eBay store. A short anecdote: when my mom bought my first guitar and amp, she bought it from them. The amp was a like $40 amp. Instead, she received a gig bag and guitar in the mail; no amp. She called. They said, ""We apologize. We will get that amp sent out ASAP, and you can keep the bag for your trouble."" Nice right? It gets better. The amp she ordered was actually out of stock and the website had not been updated. So, to make this right, they upgraded her to an $80 practice amp free of charge. I have ordered multiple guitars from them, and my favorite amp I ever owned came from them as well. But, they still fall short of Sweetwater.

Sweetwater is my favorite company for three reasons: Aaron Hoff, candy, and the showroom. Let's look at these in order. Aaron Hoff is [one of] Sweetwater's Sales Engineers. He emails me 2-3 times a year asking if he can help me. This isn't a mass email type thing, either - he knows who I am. He speaks to me on a personal level, and is familiar with things I have bought and have considered buying. He is more like the guy at the local guitar store you always talk to when you go in. It's a really nice touch to their customer interaction, even if he is just trying to sell me shit. The candy... oh, the candy. I prefer ordering from Sweetwater because with just about every order, they give you free candy. If I do not buy my strings on eBay through the MF store, it's through the Sweetwater store. They always include a small bag of things like tootsie rolls, butterscotch candies, etc. It's again, a really nice way to interact with customers. Finally, the showroom. Remember everything I liked about Sam Ash and GC? Sweetwater has a showroom in which it is the same thing. The difference is that if you can find it in their online store, you can find it there. Everything they sell is held there, so you can demo any piece of hear they have. It is fantastic. I have never been there, but it just seems like a great place.

I know this is a wall of text, but I wanted to share my experiences and opinions. What are your favorite stores, and why?

We started the course by reading Plato's Apology, and discussing it and its convictions. We then moved on to Crito, again reading and discussing the convictions. Lastly, we are reading Euthyphro and discussing its convictions (the professor said he did this as he believes Euthyphro to be the most difficult to understand so he wanted to do it last). The assignment is as follows: Using two of the three mentioned dialogues, write an essay that argues two competing claims about the meaning of either the law or piety and its relationship to human actions. For reference, it must be 1000-1500 words (and is not actually due for around 3 weeks, but I wanted to start as soon as possible since I have a lot of stuff coming up). Also, the professor suggested doing the paper over either Euthyphro-Apology or Apology-Crito, as Euthyphro-Crito would be much more difficult.

The problem I am having is defining and comparing two arguments. 

After reading Euthyphro, I believe a main conviction is that things are pious because they are loved by the gods (or vice versa), so things that are not loved by the gods can not be pious.

The Apology basically brings up a thought, about whether Socrates is purposely corrupting the young or Meletus is lying. Socrates uses the line ""Either I do not corrupt the young or, if I do, it is unwillingly and you are lying in either case."" This is after we have made the statement that corrupting young -&gt; them being wicked -&gt; hurting the people around them (Socrates). This is further strengthened because Meletus states no man would have associates that harm him rather than benefit him, so Socrates obviously is not purposely corrupting the young because that would harm him.

In Crito, the main conviction is that Socrates' accusers have unjustly sentenced him by using the laws, but if both the people and the laws have ruled that Socrates must be executed, either the people are siding with the laws or the laws are siding with the people. Socrates states that he believes the laws are just, but if Socrates stays in prison, he will be siding with his unjust accusers, and if he escapes he will be acting against the just Laws - so either way, he would be acting in injustice.

As mentioned, the problem I am having is relating these convictions to the prompt in a negative way (since they must be competing views). In the Apology, Socrates says his wisdom is a God given and God willed thing, so he must believe in the Gods. He is being charged with impiety. Would the argument from Euthyphro, that something can only be pious if willed/loved by the Gods, refute this?

I know this is a long post, and I apologize for the wall. I really appreciate any help you can offer. 

TL;DR - I can't find competing views in Euthyphro and Apology or Apology and Crito to write an essay about.

Like. Really? That's super shitty. People like this make all of us musicians look untrustworthy. 

If a young teen bought this guitar with his allowance he has saved up for 6 months, and then figured out he was lied to, that would hurt his view of musicians. We can't let this shit happen. Too many people think poorly of us already.

This is definitely a problem, as I really like my gain. I've tried shifting position, moving farther away from the amp, turning down the volume and tone knobs, and nothing seems to really work. I'm assuming, since it's a Chinese knockoff, the pick ups are not wax potted. So, the obvious solution would to be to get new pick ups.

But there's another problem: I absolutely love the way these pick ups sound when they're not squealing. The cleans are nice and full, but not muddy. The rhythm sound with a light gain is extremely bluesy and nice. With a medium or high gain, on the neck pickup especially, solos are very smooth and creamy. The bridge pick up on a high gain setting pushes out killer rock/metal tones. 

So, basically, is there a way to stop the squeal without getting different pickups? Is there a company I can ship them to and have them potted? I really love the guitar in general, but as it stands it's nearly unplayable (other than clean). ",Guitar,Help with pickups?,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/3hqypy/help_with_pickups/

I currently have a tuner, a Crybaby, a Joyo Compressor, a BOSS BD-2, a BOSS DD-3, and a FAB Chorus. I just ordered a reverb (DigiVerb) pedal and it should be here next week. I had more effects but my house was flooded, and yeah.

Next week (Monday) I will be buying a DS-1. I owned one before and loved it, but it broke ~2 years ago and I just never replaced it. Also next week, I will be buying a volume pedal and a new wah to replace my crybaby since it is starting to malfunction.

So, I just am trying to find out what to buy next. I want to keep the pedal under $40, so Joyo, Behringer, etc would be good since I just need a basic, simple, easy to use version of whatever I buy. Also, I would like to note my amp has a built in tremolo effect. It doesn't have a level control, only speed. But I shouldn't need a tremolo pedal.

Also for background, I am using a Gibson SG standard and a 1991 MIM Stratocaster in an SSS setup. I just got out of my metal phase this week actually, and I will be moving more into the alternative/grunge genre (think Audioslave, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, AiC, etc). and blues for band purposes.

When asked, I mentioned I was interested in playing in an ensemble and that I play guitar. The school put me in the Folk Roots Ensemble. I am guessing it is a sort of traditional bluegrass band. With that being said, I don't think I will be using my 100 watt 212 tube amp or SG, Les Paul, Ibanez RG, etc. 

I will need an acoustic. Now, I already have an acoustic. However, it is a single cutaway with a thin body. It is not loud at all. This is not a problem necessarily, since it is an acoustic electric, but a lot of the concerts the ensemble plays are just outside on the grass. I don't want to bother with an amp if I don't have to.

So, I decided to just buy a new acoustic. 

First, it has to be loud. I can't help but feel like I need something like a OOO sized dreadnought. 

Secondly, if possible, I want it to look the part. Having a flamed maple top Ibanez exotic series may work in the other areas, but I mean it is a bluegrass band. I want something that looks like it belongs there. For this reason, I have considered harmonellas as well.

Lastly, it has to be affordable but decent. I am looking at sub $300. 

By my own devices, I have stumbled across the Recording King Dirty Thirties guitar line. This seems like a good idea. The [Harmonella](http://recordingking.com/products/guitars-all-models/roh-07) looks the part, and I am sure it would be loud. It also comes in at under $250. Also, there is this [OOO Solid Top](http://recordingking.com/products/guitars-all-models/roh-05). It also looks the part, is under $250, and should be plenty loud. I also prefer the body shape to a normal dreadnought.

So, I just need some help. Opinions of the above, other recommendations, etc. I have a little under a month, and I won't need to buy the guitar before school starts back up - I can use what I have for awhile; but the sooner the better.

- flash drive
- laundry bag
- Sheet set and comforter (Twin XL)
- Bulletin Board
- Dry erase board (preferably full month calendar included)
- Shower Caddy
