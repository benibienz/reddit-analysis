2,"You are wrong, that is not how this probability is calculated.  
To illustrate: If your math were correct, say that we were instead concerned with who is in the top 30%. Is there a 180% chance of having a top 30% player on the other team? No, that is nonsense.  
To illustrate further, the reason it is calculated the way that I laid out:  We want to know the chance that at least one person in the lobby is a 1%er. That is the same as wanting to know the chance that NOT every person is NOT a 1%er. The chance that every person is NOT a 1%er is .99 x .99 x .99 x .99 x .99 x .99 = .9414 (note that we are not adding .99 + .99 ... that is not how probabilities are combined). Then, the chance of NOT that is 1 - .9414 = .0586 or 5.86%
He did the incorrect calculation and got close to the correct answer by chance.

3,"You may be rounding, which is great. It appears though that you are instead multiplying 1% chances by the number of slots available. This is not the correct way to determine the chance of having a 1%er in a lobby or on a team.  
You need to take the inverse probability, raise it to the x power (where x is the number of samples, or slots on a team/lobby in this case) and then take the inverse again.  
So, the chance of having a 1%er on the other team is 1 - (.99)^6 = 5.85%  
The chance of one in your lobby (assuming you are not one, as then the chance is 100%) is 1 - (.99)^11 = 10.47%  
Since we're talking about small sample and small chances, the answer is similar, but with bigger samples or chances closer to 50%, you'd get much different answers.",2016-11-16 18:41:40+00:00,da32m3k,4.0,t1_da2vpyh,8289.0,DestinyTheGame

I still don't quite understand how anyone would ever survive *without* CC constantly up - any time 2 or 3 enemies decide to attack one of my characters on a given turn it can be pretty much game over. And trying to do massive AOE damage seems extremely difficult - once I light things up there's smoke so I can't see, and fire on the ground so I can't go after anyone.
