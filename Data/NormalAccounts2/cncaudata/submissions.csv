Someone tell me if I'm crazy here, but BoRC, with the Set helm equipped instead of Eye of Peshkov, seems like a dps increase over RoRG. This allows you to swap Breath of Heaven for Blinding Flash. Then, even spamming Blinding Flash is a DPS increase, but if you line it up with CoE Fire, it's an even bigger one. This could have some other benefits as well, since you can get actual good rolls on a BoRC (not that I have ever seen one drop at P889...) and cube the CoE for a perfect 200%.

I have not had a ton of experience with 4-man groups and the strategy that everyone else has down pat, though, nor do I know the best way to actually play a monk. I am wondering, then, if anyone can answer some questions (or even better, point me to a guide or offer suggestions that tell me the answers to all the questions I'm *not* asking).

1. What skill/button setup to successful support monks use? Do you do something to automatically keep Mantra active skills up? Do you hold down generator and click Cyclone occassionally, or alternate holding generator/Cyclone?

2. What's the best way to use Inner Sanctuary - Intervene? Teleport on top of ranged dps and run back, put it on yourself and have them stack, tricks for using it to teleport (it seems to hate doors and gaps more than even dashing strike)?

3. What can I stand in? This obviously varies, but in general, what things do you find you need to move out of and what can you tank?

4. There's some good discussion on Inna4 vs I2/R2 going on. I'm wondering what effect this decision might have on other choices, i.e. gems, any of the playstyle things above. 

5. Best for last: What do you pull and what do you skip? This is the toughest for me because I've never had a group to play with. Randoms seem to think we should skip every single thing that's not an elite, but that doesn't capture any of the nuance of getting large groups of mobs on top of elites, etc. Is there any guide out there that teaches one ""how to support for fish""?",Diablo3Monks,New Support Monk Questions (how to play),https://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo3Monks/comments/4xh8lo/new_support_monk_questions_how_to_play/

TL/DR: use hybrid characters with a wide variety of abilities on each, focus on Grenades for AOE early game.

At any rate, I have been very successful thus far. I ran into some trouble with Staticbot, but once I accepted that some of the NPC's would die I easily beat him. Raddagoth though I really haven't even come close. 

What seems to be happening is that all of my CC has at least a 50% chance to fail, so even if I have a sound strategy, I simply can't executed it. I can easily fail to stun two or three times in a row, and the enemies can easily kill a character if they're not constantly stunned. 

Is this a gap in my builds (especially due to being so hybrid-y)? I don't think I really have any large AOE or other CC available to me at level 5 no matter my build, but maybe I'm missing something.

Is there some method I'm missing to make CC more reliable? Should I just try to out-level the fight somehow? Even with Rain up my stuns and freezes still fail.

I am at this point ready to get cheesy with it and either pyramid my way to a much better situation or due the really cheesy box/barrel trick, but I'd like to know whether my strategy/build is lacking in general, not just for this particular fight. E.g. perhaps I need a character or two far more focused on one aspect of magic in order to more reliably combo/aoe/cc.",DivinityOriginalSin,Re-evaluation of builds (due to Raddagoth destroying me) [minor spoilers],https://www.reddit.com/r/DivinityOriginalSin/comments/4hgvtz/reevaluation_of_builds_due_to_raddagoth/

I was very surprised when during the first fight, I immediately died because I walked out of a poison cloud, but staying in the cloud did far less damage. It appears that walking through a cloud will deal damage for every x distance you travel? Is the same true for ground effects?

I've also seen mention that because different effects combine, you often get hit with multiple ticks because of how the basic mechanics work - every change in status dealing damage again.

Everything I can find is 4-man with ponies. In particular I'm having difficulty gathering mobs while keeping elites blinded, keeping blind up all the time due to timing (do folks num-pad it?), and ever seeing anything due to needing to stare at my ability cooldowns all the time.

Secondary question - is absolute max CDR on weapon/shield/gloves/rings/shoulders/neck needed in order to perma-blind? I've read the build but it's actually a little unclear.

Secondary question 2 - how much RCR/Wrath Regen is needed to maintain Wrath on a RG?",Diablo3Crusaders,How do you zDPS in a 2/3-man?,http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo3Crusaders/comments/3ayfg0/how_do_you_zdps_in_a_23man/
