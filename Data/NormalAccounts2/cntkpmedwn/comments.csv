60,"Hey Rob, happy anniversary! You are correct about the top  being for preload and the bottom for height adjustment. Don't adjust the top, or you'll have a bad time. I am not a professional, but I believe you can go as far down as you'd like as long as the flex from the arm doesn't make the coilover hit the boot. You shouldn't need to go that far down though. The coilovers will be lower than stock struts anyways. 

Put them on, put your wheels on,put the car on the ground. Measure from the center of the wheel to the top of the wheel well. Do this on all 4 corners. Don't forget to put weight on the seats you will normally have passengers in, including driver. You might notice a difference in height on different corners. Make your adjustments to the height you'd like. Set the car down and see how it is. Take it over speed bumps, driveways, bumpy roads near you. See if you hear any rubbing. Make more adjustments if you need to. After about a month of daily driving you may need to make more adjustments if the coils settle in. 

Again, I'm not a pro. That's just how I did it. If someone else can chime in with more hints, tips, or completely corrects me that's cool too. ",2016-09-22 04:47:46+00:00,d7x398z,1.0,t3_53wnbn,11583.0,subaru

I figured I would make an order while I had the cash and make it count since I don't know when I'll be able to order again. Gotta cut costs before the actual termination date. I let the guys know about my situation and they hooked me up with a 120ml upgrade of my favorite, nana custard! They even upgraded me to two day shipping and hooked it up with a sticker!

These guys rock. Seriously! I know they are a popular vendor around here and it's for a reason. If you haven't tried them yet, do yourself a favor. You won't regret it!

You should still be able to see the other degree leads from your number belt. If you see it on the side with the 60°, its right under those leads. If you see the indication of the side with no leads, its on the back side of the weld. Same goes for the other two shots. If you are still unsure of the location, shoot another shot with your belt offset to the original location for info only. 

Providing your procedures allow, you can also shoot a contact shot with 5"" long 70mm film and a 1/2""  spacer on your collimator. It's really fast and you don't need to work about location as much. This takes some practice though. 

That shot technique is designed to give you 100° coverage of the weld as well as locate any indication. Sometimes it may be difficult. I still think classroom training needs more film interp.

I was pulling into the parking lot of a Safeway while this guy in a '15+ wrx was waiting for a break in traffic to pull out. I waved and he gave me a snooty scathing look. I was right next to you man. Cars aside, I was being friendly. Sorry if my friendship annoyed you.... Sorry for the rant. Just left a bad taste in my mouth.

379,"I wish that I could tell you right now, I love you, but it looks like I won't be around. So you won't know. 

If I could I would shrink myself, seep through your skin to your blood cells, remove whatever makes you hurt, but I'm too weak to be your cure.
