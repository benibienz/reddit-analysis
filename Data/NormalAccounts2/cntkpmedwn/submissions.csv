Other than that, nothing. No illumination at all. Tried replacing the lights with a different set of OLM LED lights. Still nothing.

Just tonight, my tail lights went out. I have diode dynamics ""tail as turn module"" and replaced the turn and reverse lights with OLM LED lights. When I tried taking the module off and plugging the stock harness into the light, the tail lights still don't work. The tail lights still work as a brake light, and also work as a turn signal with the module in. But not for tail lights alone. 

I have replaced the dome and map lights with OLM LED lights and they work fine. My DRL are also OLM LED's and my head lights are HID's from subispeed, I believe they are also OLM products and all those work fine. All my interior lights and exterior lights work fine, except the mentioned C-lights and tail lights. 

Has anyone else had this issue, or know what could be causing it? Would you recommend replacing all the lights back to stock equivalents and taking it into the dealership for a check? Could it be the BIU? Thoughts, suggestions, personal stories about this issue are welcome.

A little background; I have been doing NDT for about 5 years now. Shear wave for 1.5 years. The last company I worked for is where I got my shear wave cert. The Level 3 taught a class very specific for their test and their standards and their scopes in the pipe mill is was working at. That mill has since closed and I began working for Mistras. They would like me to certify Level 2 shear wave soon and I'm kind of nervous about what to expect on the test. They haven't given me much in the way of learning materials and there is literally no one else in this office I can talk to and ask these questions. Also, I'm used to a USN 58L and now have to learn how to use an epoch 600. If anyone has advice on that machine as well I'd really appreciate it!

I've been vaping for about 3 years now and the treebox and tfv4 mini with Ni200 coils are my first jump into TC world. I primed up the coil, filled the tank, switched the box into TC mode and couldn't wait for all the flavor and vapor people keep raving about... And I got nothing. It was more like vaping on my old protank. Flavor was muted and vapor wasn't hardly there. 

I've read the direction, watched the reviews, no where does it say I have to lock in resistance of the coil. Temp is the only thing I can adjust. I've tried it at 420F  up to 600F and the difference is minimal. I've adjusted the how fast it ramps up (soft, normal, hard) and again, no difference. When I hit the device, I can barely get it to reach the temperature I've selected unless I fire and wait for it to ramp up before is start to take a hit. By then it's not an enjoyable experience. 

What I've noticed as i hit the device: the resistance of the coil changes on the screen as it ramps up. The wattage ramps up consistently. The temperature usually starts at ~100F and gets progressively higher but stays cool as I hit the device averaging about 350F.

What am I doing wrong?? I want to like it. I want to love it. At the moment I'm sitting here thinking maybe I should just stick to dripping. The TFV4 mini and the Ni200 coils are the only thing I got to work with TC wise so I can't really experiment with any thing else. Any help or experience you could share would be awesome.
