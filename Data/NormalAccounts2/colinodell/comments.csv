I basically contacted A, lit a small fire under them, and they finally confirmed they found the payment and would send it along this week.  I'll definitely stay proactive, but it looks like things are moving in the right direction now :)

1,"Thanks, that advice was really helpful!

[Per the update I just posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/5cxei7/mortgage_payment_missing_md_xpost_rlegaladvice/da0f5vw/), Company A was basically going really slow and not communicating their status to B.  Both A and C advised me to make the other payments as usual and that this would resolve itself over the next couple weeks, so I'll do just that.",2016-11-14 22:27:31+00:00,da0fm4y,2.0,t1_da03czx,14886.0,RealEstate
2,"Thank you so much, this was extremely helpful!

Several emails and phone calls later, it turns out that CompanyA was just being really slow and not communicating with anyone else - they're planning to transfer the funds to CompanyB this week.

Despite CompanyC sending the mortgage to their collections department immediately, the rep I spoke to was extremely helpful explaining the situation and assuring me that everything would work out provided the ""missing"" payment arrives in January.

So it looks like my next steps are:

1. Wait for that transfer to go through
2. Once received by CompanyB, follow up and ensure they send it to CompanyC by January.
3. Continue making all other payments as usual",2016-11-14 22:17:49+00:00,da0f5vw,2.0,t1_da087v1,8435.0,RealEstate

11,"If you're using Magento 1.x, you could modify the `index.php` file to show the actual errors instead of hiding them.  But we don't want to show errors to anybody visiting your site for two reasons:

1. It can scare non-technical users away.
2. Bad guys could potentially use that information against you.

So instead of showing the errors to everyone, let's make it so you need to add some special text to the URL in order to enable the errors.

To do this, find this line:

    #ini_set('display_errors', 1);

And change it to:

    if (isset($_GET['show_errors']) {
        Mage::setIsDeveloperMode(true);
        ini_set('display_errors', 1);
    }

Save this change and fire up your browser.  Go to any page which exhibits the issue and add this to the end of the URL: `?show_errors=1`  You should now be able to see the error!

Now go ahead and search the usual sites for the error you see :)

(As others have mentioned, the `file.php` and `local.xml` changes did not help and probably made things worse - undo those changes first if you can)

Hope that helps!

**Edit:** When you're done debugging the issue, undo the changes to `index.php` so that nobody accidentally finds your secret workaround to show errors.",2016-11-03 03:15:16+00:00,d9jfhnv,1.0,t3_5arm64,31610.0,Magento

debugger. Practically speaking, you can step over/out backwards, step 
backwards, run backwards, run to cursor backwards, set breakpoints in the 
past and so forth (apart from the usual debugging capabilities when running 
forward).
&gt; 
&gt; Additionally, you don't need to learn to use a new IDE/User Interface and 
you can continue using PhpStorm, Netbeans, Eclipse PDT etc. debugging front

&gt; Do not wear anything metallic. Keep your jewelry/watch in your carry-on and put it on after you get past TSA.
&gt;
&gt; Have all your electronics ready to put into the little tray. 

Honestly, just put everything that's normally on your person (phone, sunglasses, keys, belt, etc.) into your carry-on before entering the security line - the only exception should be your ID and boarding pass.  This way you won't need to scramble to get everything into an extra bin.

&gt; Do not take drinks or anything liquid on the plane with you.

If you need to take tolietries in your carry-on, put them at the very top in a single ziploc bag so you can remove them quickly and easily.

&gt; Leave for the airport three hours earlier so that that you will have plenty of time to get through without a rush. I usually arrive at the airport 4-5 hours before my flight, depending on the length and distance.

262,"Is all of this really necessary?  Why can't the CoC establish some basic guidelines which the community as a whole can interpret and enforce on their own?  Is it even possible to come up with a list of well-defined examples?

I'm reminded of this quote by Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart regarding the definition of an observable yet subjective fact/event:

&gt; I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced within that shorthand description, and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so. But [I know it when I see it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it).

Perhaps we don't need to come up with a strict, all-encompassing definition of what ""bad conduct"" is.

I'm also curious as to why some folks are proposing that a CoC team/tribunal/panel/court/whatever be created.  Is our community not capable of identifying and dealing with bad conduct ""when we see it""?  Perhaps there are examples I'm unaware of where the community failed to act, but I'd like to think that the onus is on **everyone** to deal with bad conduct instead of offloading that responsibility to some bureaucratic group.

Furthermore, it seems like creating a CoC team is the reason some of these controversial issues are coming up:

 - The need to have well-defined rules
 - Determining who will enforce the rules
 - Requiring some sort of ""due process"" or appeal procedure

Again I ask whether it would be better or easier to educate and empower the community to act and hold people accountable instead of empowering only a handful of individuals.
