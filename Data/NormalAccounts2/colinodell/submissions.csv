The loan is about to be transferred again and I want to protect myself from any potential issues.

---

The longer version:

I recently purchased a new home in Maryland.  My first payment was due on 11/1.  Because I was going to be travelling abroad at the end of October, I mailed my mortgage payment to Company A (who originated the loan) on 10/14.  My bank shows the check was cashed on 10/18.

Around the time I made that payment, I received notice that my loan was being transferred to Company B, and that they would accept all payments made on/after 11/1, but that any payments before that date should be sent to Company A (which I did).

Well it turns out that Company A never transferred my payment to Company B, so as far as Company B is concerned, I'm 14 days late.

And now it turns out that Company B is transferring my mortgage to Company C effective 12/1.  I don't really mind another transfer, but I'm very concerned about how this missing payment will affect things.

I have two questions:

1. Is there anything I should do to protect myself from any negative actions caused by Company A not transferring that payment?
2. Assuming Company A fails to locate or transfer that payment in a timely fashion, should I ""re-pay"" that payment directly to Company B or C, or should I keep waiting &amp; pushing for a resolution by Company A?

During the home inspection, we found that a new water heater was installed without an expansion tank, so the seller had one installed.

Fast-forward 6 weeks and I notice there's a leak - water is pooling on top of the water heater and there's obvious water marks on the floor: https://imgur.com/a/PsNvp

I was able to trace the leak to top of the T-joint (by drying the pipe and feeling for where the wetness starts).

So I guess I have a few questions:

1. Should I find the person who installed this and ask them to fix it, or did they do a really terrible job and shouldn't be trusted?
2. Is this something a non-handy person like myself can easily fix, or would you recommend getting a pro?  (I do have a home warranty with a $100 deductable that I wouldn't mind using if needed).
3. Does the rusted pipe going into the heater need to be replaced?
4. If a pro does come to fix this, what other questions should I ask them besides ""why did this happen""?

**TL;DR:** Is CoreOS + Shipyard overhead for a single Docker host running a few containers?

---

I'm currently running a few Docker hosts on my QNAP NAS:

 - CrashPlan
 - Confluence
 - Home Assistant
 - Mosquitto
 - Let's Encrypt certbot (runs on cron)

(I'll eventually be adding a couple others)

The QNAP NAS has a really nice tool called Container Station  ([screenshot](https://www.qnap.com/solution/container_station/_images/carousel/3.png)) for managing containers, viewing the consoles of them, etc.  However, I'm maxing out the NAS's resources and would therefore like to create a separate box to house my Docker apps.

The new box I'm building is fairly simple - it'll have an Intel Quad-Core Pentium N3700, 8 GB RAM, and a 500 GB SSD.  The problem is I don't know what software I'll need to get functionality similar to QNAP's, but I don't want to waste CPU/RAM unnecessarily.

**Is CoreOS + Shipyard overkill for a single server like this?** I really just want a low-overhead OS and a decent web-based GUI to manage the containers.  If you think another distro (Ubuntu perhaps?) and a different web GUI would be better (and wouldn't hog too many resources) I'd love to hear your suggestions!

Thanks in advance!

We've just received a second noise complaint from the property manager alleging that there's ""loud arguing, stomping, and banging"" coming from our unit late at night.

The first complaint alleged that this happened on a night when both my fiance and I were out-of-state.  Upon receiving the letter, we immediately went to the leasing office and gave our side of the story.  We promised to be more considerate anyway, and asked that if anyone had any complaints to come knock on our door and get them resolved.  We haven't received a single knock or note on our door.

Even though the alleged noises definitely aren't coming from our unit, we've taken steps to be even quieter than usual, but that doesn't seem to have helped us - we've got a second complaint here threatening eviction.

We feel this is either a case of mistaken identity or malicious bullying by some grumpy neighbor.

**What can we possibly do in this situation to exonorate ourselves, or at least make the complaints stop?**  I feel so helpless here...",legaladvice,False noise complaints from neighbors [MD],https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3nn1nl/false_noise_complaints_from_neighbors_md/
