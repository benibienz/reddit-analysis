Nope.  I'm advocating giving lawbreakers tickets - I don't want discrimination.  Unfortunately, as the status quo currently sits, every else literally does discriminate by letting what they determine as a certain class off scott-free.

20,"&gt; Jaywalkers (or homeless for that matter) don't hurt local businesses.

You apparently have not read reports from businesses on south Nevada that specifically talk about homeless people sleeping on their property or leaving trash and deterring business.

Jaywalkers are just the tip of the iceberg.  When you have an area that turns into a free for all, more serious crime goes up.  The people that rob, vandalize, etc 100% are jaywalkers.  So go get them first on easy charges/prosecution.  But it's also a point to get in these people's heads that there are consequences for thinking that they can do whatever they want.

&gt;than a 911 call and police report would have been the responsible thing to do

I never said I didn't.  My point is that in crime ridden areas, police need to stop showing up AFTER the fact and be there in the first place to deter crime and clean it up FAST and HARD within two weeks.  That is what I'm proposing.  What you're saying is that the status quo is fine.  So my question to you is this:  By maintaining the same policy, do you expect South Nevada to get better, worse or stay the same?  I've already pointed out with evidence that similar weak policy such as on Colfax in Denver has maintained the shit show that it is.  No one has the balls to get things done.

Ok, well at least that's a clear opinion that you have made.  I respect that.

31,"&gt; You'd like more geographic hard police patrols

Yep, nothing illegal with that.  It's called patrolling areas which are known for crime - which is exactly the point of the police in the first place.  And it cleans up an area and will get back to a normal distribution of patrols like other areas soon enough.  Every potential stop is based on individual circumstances based on the law and can never be racially targeted. i.e. no illegal Terry stops because you think they're up to no good.

&gt;enforcement of petty misdemeanors over more serious crime

Half right.  Yes more enforcement because 1) it makes for a nicer area and 2) you get people before they do other more serious crime 3) it doesn't take resources away from other serious issues because as I pointed out it pays for itself and you can do new hires without increasing the budget.

&gt;police to pay for all of this by ticketing the poorest of society Ferguson-style

Every citizen is responsible to the same law and accountability.  You aren't going to deny that right?  If someone breaking the law happens to be poor, that's not my problem.  Everyone deserves equal rights and responsibilities, no?  Maybe the judge will be fair and offer community service instead.  To be clear, if the poor is running over Colfax for instance, are you saying to simply not patrol and let whatever happen because they are poor?...

Nope that's all of the key points.  Glad I could answer with logic that's hard to refute.  But if you like the status quo, then...I guess we have different expectations.

No, correction is little government regulation.  Most of the regulations are not by companies, but from the market...TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.

&gt;Little to zero regulations = Polluted air and water.

Um, nope that would be initiation of force.  The dogma you've been reading is false. 

&gt;You honestly think companies will regulate themselves?

No, why would they do that?  The market does regulation.  You need to read a book.

&gt;You're a fucking retard

lol, still at level 1 ad-hominems I see.  You have a lot to learn.


What’s overlooked—intentionally or not—is that the alternative to a government-regulated economy is not an unregulated one. As a matter of fact, “unregulated economy,” like square circle, is a contradiction in terms. If it’s truly unregulated it’s not an economy, and if it’s an economy, it’s not unregulated. The term “free market” does not mean free of regulation. It means free of government interference, that is, legal plunder and other official aggressive force.

246,"The lesser of two evils argument is put out every election cycle by the major parties to keep the duopoly. More people in the country are registered as independents than republicans or democrats. More people than ever want another option, and more than ever that are voting republican or democrat are admitting to voting for one to simply not have the other, rather than really being ""for"" someone. First, the argument fails to realize that so many people actually make the conscious effort to not vote - because they don't like their options - in other words, their vote was never going to belong to a Republican or Democrat to begin with, so they stay home. A vote must be earned. 


The Commission on Presidential Debates was formed by former Republicans and Democrats, an it sets the rules for entry into the primetime debates - mainly requiring the candidate having at least 15% of the national vote in preference polls. Gary Johnson is at 12% even with the little media attention. If he gains just a few points and gets into the debates, then it's anybody's game. So Rush &amp; other mainstream Republicans are already spewing the line early even though they never thought Trump would make it early on, but he defied everyone's expectations because things can happen quickly. But in any case, even if the Libertarian Party candidate gets 5% of the national vote, that's the bar for federal election funding like the major parties get and it would be the real start to next cycle, not to mention other people seeing a voting shift away from the same two parties that everyone has been complaining about for decades, which is also led to greater polarization and division in the country. For the national election, since popular vote is only counted at the state level, and then 100% of the state's delegates go to that candidate's national tally, it makes even more sense for non-swing state voters to add to the numbers of another party whether it be Libertarian, Green, etc because for instance in TN, everyone will be voting for Trump other than Nashville and Memphis (insert racist joke here), so TN is an easy state for Trump to pick up 11 electoral votes, so one could argue that ""voting for Trump in TN is wasting your vote"" because it makes no difference (because obviously not everyone is going to hear this message, and there's still going to be big enough turn out for him to easily win). Point being that - of course you should do or vote what you think has the greatest overall impact. For instance, I registered as Republican because I thought those caucuses here were more important than playing part on the Libertarian side at that time. That way I could push for Rand Paul, and on caucus night, he had dropped out so then my last hope was for Ted Cruz because he was IMO next best for being a Constitutional conservative and would've been close enough to overall ideals that I could vote for him in the general election. Got to the state convention and Colorado did go for Cruz, but of course in the end didn't add enough to his tally among other states to help him win. Without diving into issues, the libertarian philosophy is far closer to my ideals than the two ""main"" candidates.",2016-07-27 19:23:38+00:00,d5tdq40,1.0,t3_4uuj76,22240.0,PoliticalDiscussion

604,"&gt; As a private business that serves the public it opens itself to certain societal and legal obligations under the civil rights acts. A private club (or organization) is exempt from many of those obligations.

So one needs to just use the loophole of being a private club in order to forego most of the discrimination loopholes?  Like Hooters only hiring women servers because libs figured out they needed exceptions?  Discrimination is only illegal after a certain number of employees (15 by federal law). If you are a startup with only 10 employees, you're legally allowed to use race or gender as a factor.
Age discrimination also only applies after age 40. It's legal to fire someone because they're too old at 39, but illegal to fire someone because they're too old at age 40. Seems like the libs keep coming up with rules instead of sticking to principles like libertarians....",2016-04-26 03:18:15+00:00,d2hh7s7,2.0,t1_d2hfwvz,1912.0,Libertarian

606,"&gt; role of private and public organizations and the law

So you're disagreeing with my statement that CPD and the bakery are BOTH private organizations?  You think because the CPD is a non-profit, that makes them public?

&gt;Johnson has hypocritically tried multiple times to sue the CPD for antitrust reasons.

I agree it is hypocritical.  And I stand by the CPD being a private organization doing what they want, just like the private bakery doing what they want, and that's a philosophical viewpoint; I understand that it was illegal because of discriminating simply against the buyer rather than because it was failure to produce a rainbow themed cake for instance.

&gt;LP and the Greens are more than free to have debates and invite any other candidates they wish to participate.

Yes of course, which completely misses the original point, so don't lecture me on failure to have an intelligent conversation.  You need to think philosophically perhaps.",2016-04-26 03:02:18+00:00,d2hgkqi,4.0,t1_d2hfdut,1720.0,PoliticalDiscussion

610,"&gt; The CPD's goal is to serve the American public, by educating them about Presidential candidates. 

They specifically use polls that literally do not even include other candidates within those polls.  Their original directors were from the Democrat and Republican parties.  Their organization originated when the League of Women Voters couldn't take the pressure anymore from the party bosses.

&gt;unless you go on to explain why they're similar in the question

Already answered. 
*They both formed a private Corporation structure using the laws of their state. They both wish to cater to their private club*

&gt;The CPD's goal is to serve the American public

Except the minority which they don't serve (50% of Americans want a third party candidate and dislike the status quo)

&gt;Because their goal is to serve the public, they receive a tax-exempt status under section 501(c)(3)

So non-discriminatory businesses serving the public can be tax-exempt?  Incorrect, please re-read the tax code.

&gt;Their objection was based on what the cake was for...

Should gun shop owners not sell a gun if they fear the individual are in a bad state of mind and may use it non-intended purposes?  If yes, the the owner is making the objection based on what it is for.

727,Nope.  And the reason for having the business fund the SEP is that it makes it more reasonable to have a lower salary rather than self funding it.  Also health insurance that the business can reimburse you for your personal premiums paid is included in your W-2 gross salary but not subject to FICA tax.  You then deduct the health premiums on personal return.  It works out well again because it inflates your salary to be more reasonable against your distributions (profit).,2016-02-14 22:56:16+00:00,d000yrq,7.0,t1_d000aro,1136.0,personalfinance

So when you file your annual corporate return, the corporation will show a net profit of $40k.  You will say that you only have one shareholder (you) and 100% of that profit flows to you on a form called a K-1.  It is your responsibility on your personal return to report that business profit that flowed to you from your K-1 form.  You will still owe income tax on it but will have avoided FICA tax.  It is therefore advisable to pay estimated tax payments throughout the year in anticipation of the extra income, or - if you own the business - just withhold much more on your normal salary checks.  It's easy if the business just pays your quarterly.",2016-02-14 17:53:59+00:00,czzqcl3,7.0,t1_czzc8w4,39882.0,personalfinance

Is the $14k just for federal income tax and social security/medicare?  Or does it include state taxes too?  

If you kept things the same in the future, you'd want to pay estimated tax quarterly.

You can be the sole employee/shareholder with an S-corp.  By default, you form a 'C' corporation, and then fill out federal form 2553 which grants ""S"" status for the corporation.  This prevents double taxation (company pays income tax, then what's left over, owner/employee pays personal income tax).

The major advantage to an S-corp are the savings of 15.3% FICA taxes on leftover profit after your reasonable salary.  The corporation can also pay for your health insurance and retirement via SEP.

Example: 100k in Revenue

$10k in general operating expenses

$40k for salary expense

$10k SEP (Simplified Employee Pension) which is business deduction

$40k leftover profit distribution (Save about $6100 from FICA taxes)
