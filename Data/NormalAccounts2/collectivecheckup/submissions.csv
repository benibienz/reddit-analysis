  On south Nevada for instance, I literally see at LEAST three violations within ten minutes, whether it be pedestrian jaywalking, someone riding a bicycle through red lights, or some other vehicle violation.  In my opinion, it is being run like Colfax in Denver where everyone knows they can do whatever they want because for some reason the police don't want to fix the area.  Through all of the tickets, the position of just one officer constantly patrolling the area would more than pay for itself.  But in general, the public IS paying to get the amateur law breakers dealt with, but it's simply not happening now.  

And assuming the police chief is not actually an idiot, therefore they simply choose not to patrol certain areas, and instead wait to be called about something after the fact.  Of course there are other serious issues going on, but this simply means more officers need to be added to simply patrol and prevent crime in the first place, and as I said, the revenues brought in from law breakers pays for itself anyways, so I don't buy the budget shortfall.  So why not give out 40 tickets in 24 hours in one area?  It can easily be done, and we need to get these amateurs set straight so the rest of us can live in a nice environment like other towns that set high standards.

EDIT:  The majority has spoken.  They're fine with the status quo.  I'm moving back to Highlands Ranch to surround myself with people who have higher standards.  No wonder shitty areas never get turned around - only the determined people like myself have the willpower to just get out of them.",ColoradoSprings,Question about understaffed CSPD patrolling,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColoradoSprings/comments/53lrp5/question_about_understaffed_cspd_patrolling/

Will update info.  (I'm near I-25/Tejon)

3:04:  Code 1 and Priority 1 Dispatch.  CSPD on ""accident alert"" as they are very busy with whatever is going on. 

3:09  KRDO is picking up on the story.  It is at Taco Bell ~~or Wendy's~~ on South Nevada - that is where the 10 cop cars are.  Blood in parking lot and crime scene tape just went up.  

3:15  KRDO Reporter Emily Allen arrived on scene and tweeted that only 1 hospitalized after being shot; ~~no deaths.~~
[Tweet &amp; Picture of scene](https://twitter.com/EmilyAReports)

3:35  I walked down the street to see it myself - 20 officers are there.  One male civilian was in his car who they wouldn't let leave the scene; an officer was taking pictures on the outside eating patio of Taco Bell which has a 3.5 ft wall...I would imagine that the shooting took place there.   A suspect is in custody!  

6:00 Drove by scene on my way somewhere and it's still a crime scene with at least 15 officers, detectives still there.  An older rusty looking gray vehicle that appeared to be a Bronco was being loaded onto a tow-truck - maybe this was the shooter's vehicle?

6:30 Male shooting victim taken to hospital has died.  :(

The city of Colorado Springs has public benches where they lease ad-space to any potential advertiser.  Currently, one church has purchased a lot of ads that say ""Jesus is Lord.""  Due to some complaints, the city realizes that they must equally consider other ad-buyers who want to combat that message and submit ads that focus on atheists, Islam, etc., and so the city is reviewing policy to see if they can get out of the awkward situation by just banning all ads that are religious in nature to avoid a legal battle.

My question is - can't the city just make a business deal to lease (""outsource"")  all of the benches to a private company that will maintain them; meanwhile the private company retains rights for the look of the benches, and it just so happens that they (company) sells ad space on them while accepting or denying whatever they want based on their own company's terms?",scotus,Any SCOTUS cases about local government leasing out public property to private group which then uses property for religious event?

1) What happens in the event of audit? -- auditors want to show up at the principal office street address as shown with the secretary of state?  They aren't going to meet at the post office...

2) Ideally the registered agent (me) would also want to use the same USPS box address which is also public record.  Can I put my business name and my real name on the USPS box application to get everything in one box, or is everyone buying two separate boxes to accomplish this?

The local department of revenue also wants you to enter your mailing address (USPS box fine here) and a location address (assuming for sales tax implications)...and I assume you would need to put your real home location for this instance?  (It's an online business).

The articles online I'm reading about the USPS box for a business address don't answer these specific questions.  And does the articles of incorporation need an update or the minutes showing an update to the address?

For cash basis accounting, do you record the transaction at the moment of the credit card sale, or when it 'clears' and is actually transferred to your bank account two days later?

I've read about 'constructive receipt' and I would argue that even when a payment is received and is added to the pending balance or pending transfer balance, it is still available because you can actually send an immediate refund with that money to that customer or another.

So if anyone uses Stripe and cash basis accounting method, do you use dates from their ""created on"" or ""available on"" column?",tax,Cash basis accounting timing of receiving payments through Stripe,https://www.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/41f0nq/cash_basis_accounting_timing_of_receiving/
