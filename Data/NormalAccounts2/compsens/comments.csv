0,"Roughly:

Yes, for the first case, it is equivalent to taking a subset of the rows of the Fourier matrix (F(x)  is really Fx where F is the fourier operator) so this operation is akin to S F x where S is a binary mask matrix.

For the second case, you could also do what you propose but it would work well if the x is sparse in the fourier space -i.e if Fx is sparse -

M can be a random gaussian matrix. F could be any wavelet dictionary. What is important initally is for x to be sparse in the space of F -i.e Fx is sparse-

Yes, another proof of concept was tested successfully on our breadboard. The very promising results will be unveiled later this Summer. And, yes, we are aware of Nando de Freitas et al's very nice paper.

4,"Hi,

We are building a hardware technology that computes, at first, random projections. The technology can go very fast and does not need the complexity of memory storage. Furthermore, operations can be performed at a fraction of the typical power consumption of current systems. 

A first Proof Of Concept (POC) was put on ArXiv a while back: https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.06664

Igor.
