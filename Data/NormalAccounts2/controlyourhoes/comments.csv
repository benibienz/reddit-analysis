0,"Honestly, I've struggled with oily skin my whole life and genuinely scoffed at the gross idea of putting MORE oil on my face. I don't know about OCM proper, using cooking oil etc, but this Simple stuff washes off really nicely - breaks down with water, so I feel absolutely no residue at all, just my own skin. And the benefits I guess are that I'm not stripping away everything with acid and bubbles, so my skin doesn't react by making a butttonne of oil to compensate. Funny how science actually works! Coming from a former sceptic, try the oil.",2016-09-06 07:37:58+00:00,d7b93pe,3,t1_d7alp2f,42765,SkincareAddictionUK
1,"Bought on a whim Simple's new cleansing oil (grapeseed oil, I think?) when I saw it (¬£4ish) and swapped my old faithful foaming daily facial wash for it in an attempt to experiment with the oil cleansing method. Ladies and gentleman, I was the most sceptical of the lot, but I am sold. Not necessarily on the product, but using oil to cleanse. My skin is clear, soft, feels clean, and the wave of sebum that I fought on the daily after using all my old products has disappeared to leave beautiful healthy mattification all day long. OCM üëç

5,"Hi oil_moon, just wanted to chime in here as your story felt very familiar to my own. I recently left a good, well-paid office job with great prospects in a hugely popular field. I left because our organisation went under and so everyone lost their jobs, but I was unhappy for a long time before that.


I thought once I had the office job with regular easy hours I'd be sorted, happy for life. But my reality was much like yours: sedentary, unfulfilled, desire to be out, outside, away from petty gossip and politics, bored and yet supposedly tied to my 'enviable' position by the money and prospects. I gained weight, I stayed in a bad relationship, I spent all my money on crap I didn't need and food to fill the weekends.
My redundancy turned out to be the best thing that could have happened to me. 


I played for ages with what I might be happy doing - working outside, being active, being with animals or working the land. I looked at ranch work on workaway.com, I looked at farm work, I looked at teaching English as a foreign language abroad. I looked at everything and anything. I considered career paths I would never have previously acknowledged before. Somehow I was lucky enough to fall into something that turned out to be perfect for me. I run around all day, I laugh every day, I'm training and qualifying in my new field more and more, and I slump into bed exhausted every night but almost stunned with disbelief that my gamble paid off, and that I'm happy, and tired, and more healthy and more fulfilled. I have more money because I spend less on crap to fill a void, even though I took a massive paycut. And I can feel where the stress and tension and misery used to make me slow and miserable, and where instead I'm now zingy and alive and dedicated and in love with my life.


Friends and family give me raised eyebrows and concerned looks at the abrupt and unprecedented job change and lifestyle change, but it doesn't matter because I'm so happy. I followed what felt good to me, and I thank God/Allah/Vishnu every day I could. Follow what feels good to you, think about what was unthinkable before, and only good can come. Recently I got offered a hugely prestigious position in London in my old field for huge amount of money - even more than before - and I turned it down in order to proceed on my new path. That's how much of a difference the levels of fulfillment and types of lifestyle make. Take heart, it can be done. Follow what feels good.",2016-08-16 13:37:00+00:00,d6jnnt5,1,t3_4xyfuc,19316,UKJobs

13,"You know, it sounds like a joke, but I think we're too awkward to challenge anyone as much as our American friends! So I know my closest friends' intentions about having children after years of knowing them. But I don't ask others, really, and they don't ask me. Even family doesn't stick it's nose in. And if one of us is brave enough to say 'actually no, I'm not planning on having kids' (like, when it's necessary, on a date or a little while into a relationship) it's met with polite murmurs and/or silence. The proper, repressed way! Haha. And if someone (rude) has outright asked (and by rude I mean our version of rude, which is attempting to discuss personal matters before the person in question brings it up or before you know the person well enough), I tend to respond very quietly if I have to, or not at all. This is the British equivalent of bursting into tears, so people stop asking pretty quickly. And I think as a society we're good at not assuming people want children, or can but won't, or... Assuming anything. We loathe assuming, lest it makes us look like a boob. But that's just my experience from my little corner of this little island. See, I don't even want to assume enough to speak for my countrymen!

For instance, I was talking to my doctor about contraception choices and she briefly said 'blah blah blah and if you're planning on having children this option is good', not a statement that begs a response but it was my opportunity to either say something to confirm, or not say anything at all. I remained politely quiet in my chair. So she breezed on, 'maybe more permanent options would suit you, like blah'. Flawless, perfect, everyone happy, no one blushing with embarrassment, no need for a cup of tea after other than simple thirst. I love my doctor, by the way.

And I've written you an essay! Sorry! Haha.",2016-07-27 20:50:31+00:00,d5thyl2,5,t1_d5th0gj,1174,childfree

EDIT: Actually, you know what, guys? I write a bit for my own pleasure. About my job. Working with children at a boarding school. Haha. I'm as CF as they come, which makes my new career very interesting and out of character, and I'm writing about the experience! This also explains why my days off are so treasured...
