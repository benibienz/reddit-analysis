I work hard. I'm a ballbuster. I am on that grind. I am working until my bank balance looks like my phone number. I'm getting guap.
That means when it's my glorious CF day off, I shop like a demon and then collapse in a comfy coffee house armchair to read one of my many delicious books and to coo over the pretty new things I have.
Today as I enter my favourite floor of my favourite café, I see my favourite armchair is two meters away from a couple of women and a couple of under-fives. My glee diminishes. Sigh. Here goes. I settle in, preparing to ignore the bitchy mum-chat inevitably coming, and the loud dirty child-play inevitably being ignored in favour of the mum-chat. 
After a few minutes, something feels wrong. I'm not being disturbed. The atmosphere is still pleasant. I keep glancing over. The women are talking, calmly and adultly so low I can't make out the subject of conversation. The children are sitting, quietly nibbling on their snacks or drinking their drinks. The moment one acts up, and by acts up I mean spills crumbs or puts a foot up on their chair, the (I assume) mother immediately turns and in an even lower and quieter tone tells the underling to stop, until it does. Then she returns to her conversation.
I'm agog. Magic fairy children? Ritalin? Rohypnol? I stare on.
The little girl gets angsty, she kneels up on her chair. This time the low tone doesn't work. Instantly mum gets up, picks her up, and pops her back down on her bum. The child begins to mewl. In a second the mum is down on her level, telling her to stop crying, still in a calm voice.
""Noooo"", wails the child.
""Yes"", states the mother without an element of doubt or hesitancy. And the child stops!
Now they're practising quietly saying 'please' and 'thank you' as they pass each other things!
By contrast another family has just come onto the floor, children screaming and running instantly. And I kid you not, a tantrum has started as I type about a broken toy the kid broke by throwing it at a wall!
It gives me hope, CF. Hope that good parenting exists, and those that procreate can learn it and from it. Snaps for all the good parents out there making kids bearable to be around. Eternal damnation still for all the parents that blight my day off.",childfree,[Rave] The dreaded café nightmare,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/4utug4/rave_the_dreaded_café_nightmare/
