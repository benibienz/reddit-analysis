Whenever I put her in her crate to step out for a few minutes, she only poops in the crate we are trying to train her in.  Will she learn faster if we take her outside? We rescued her a week ago so I'm sure this will take time judging from everything I've read. 

I always give her a treat after she goes on the pee pad,  but I feel like I'm doing something wrong, this is my first dog. 

Thank you for any help! She's so well behaved already that I'm amazed. The only issue is her going to the bathroom where we shouldn't. 

I'm just looking for tips to do this right!

We took her for her first vet visit yesterday and they determined she's a spaniel/chihuahua mix!
