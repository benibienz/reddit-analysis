I'm primarily posting here to calm my worrying nerves but I do have a question.

About two weeks ago I started having testicular pain and one morning noticed a bit of blood in my urine. Thinking it was a kidney stone (I've had them before) I went to the doctor! They tested my urine noticing a little blood and referred me to a Urologist. Fast-forward about a week and I'm still having both sides flank pain (mild and it comes and goes) with random light testicular pain. I had an ultrasound done of my abdomen and testicles they found nothing and the urologist did a physical examination and found nothing (no hernia, lumps etc) I also gave him a urine sample where he said it was completely normal. I had a CT scan scheduled for today but it was cancelled due to the doctor needing to be somewhere else for surgery. I'm going out of town for a week and am kind of freaked out. I'm still having light pain but as I Google see ""Bladder Obstruction, Kidney Failure, Kidney Cancer) etc. and I freak thinking that something horrible is going to occur. Should I relax?

Considering the Steam support is complete rubbish I thought I'd stop by here and ask for some assistance. I am currently a High School teacher that during the summer enjoys video games like anyone else. Last night I played CS:GO for a few hours and than went out with a friend. Tonight I got on Counter Strike: Global Offensive to find that I had no items which I was a little taken back. I looked into my trade history and found I traded all my items away to a player at 10:52 P.M. on August 9, 2015. I was out with a friend during the time the incident occurred. As someone who doesn't get to play much during the school year due to my teaching and coaching the items I get as drops, gifts, crates etc. are somewhat valuable to me and carry meaning. My steam account is continuously signed in and from yesterday afternoon I have not been logged off, yet somehow an individual traded my items to himself? I ran a virus scan checked for loggers, malware, etc. all came back clear. Below is a screenshot of the incident with the individuals name and account. His account is level [27] and he seems to be pretty active. Is there a way I can get my items back?

I posted here a few days ago with a question and got some awesome, honest answers so I thought I'd ask another! How long does it take your body to really ""get used"" to Nicotine?

My Nicotine Background: I started smoking when I was 18 (currently 20) about 1-2 cigarettes a day, not to much and half the time I probably wasn't inhaling the full amount from each drag. I than started ""vaping"" where I was vaping a good amount pretty much all day on an 11mg liquid. I've recently gotten into dipping in the past few months and I'd consider myself to take 1-2 smaller sized pinches a day a.k.a. a very little amount. I still find myself getting dizzy when dipping and not sure why, my body has been exposed to nicotine for over 2 years now nearly on a daily basis. Wasn't sure if it was from the actual nicotine or anxiety (I take anti-depressants due to some former life trauma).
