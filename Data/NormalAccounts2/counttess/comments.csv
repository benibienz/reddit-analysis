Yup! They may even be a university recruiter. It's probably the best use of LinkedIn. I frequently connect with/receive connection requests from people in my field and with recruiters. Some people choose not to do this, and that's okay - recruiters can still message you. When I was more actively using LinkedIn as a job search tool (and had a profile geared that way), I would get at least 4-5 messages a month, sometimes more.

5,"It's higher than I would personally like for a subscription model. If you include Captivate, Adobe Creative Cloud is $840 a year, but if you start including Adobe Stock into that then it starts to even out (in comparison to Articulate offering assets in their new subscription).

Overall though I do like subscription models because you're constantly getting updates and not worrying about being on the latest version as everyone else.

And Articulate has become ubiquitous at so many organizations, so they can kind of price it how they want - while Adobe Creative Cloud (while also used heavily in organizations) perceptibly has a larger freelancer base so they have to consider that in their pricing.

Edit: I do believe it's too pricey for independents. 

Those are my thoughts on the subscription model -

On Articulate 360 itself, well - I just started pushing it up the food chain at work to get it approved. So I'm excited about it. I'm most excited about their new review tool and their online authoring platform. We have a lot of courses that don't need a super heavy lifting that will perfectly fit into Rise. And we've been struggling here on how to get others to review our Articulate modules because we can't get a dedicated server, etc. (lots of security here as a regulator).

I also think it would allow them to make more agile changes to Storyline itself, which I'm excited about. They can implement new features without waiting for a new version to role around.

16,"&gt; * Bad healthcare for a majority of the populatoin

Do you have a source on that? Mostly curious what percentage it is, not to dispute you.

&gt; * Severe wealth inequality

[This is true](http://fortune.com/2015/09/30/america-wealth-inequality/)/. We also house some of the richest people in the world such as [Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, Jeff Bezos,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World%27s_Billionaires) etc, etc. who - because of America's opportunities - created some of the most well known and innovative companies. Of course - some of the people in this list aren't that great, but we take the good with the bad.

&gt; * toxic politics

Many countries have toxic politics, but it's why we have quite the checks and balances system here. The presidential election right now is crazy, but people seem to forget that he actually doesn't have *that* much power in comparison to the collective minds of the Congress and Senate. Of course he has power, but it's not tyrannical. 

&gt; * majority of the population overworked and overstressed

Again - would be interested in stats here. I think this is true - but I'm curious how it compares to other countries. According to this site, [we are actually doing pretty okay](http://www.atlasandboots.com/most-stressed-countries/).

&gt; * have to have a car

Not everywhere in the US. I lived without a car in DC, it's practically a requirement to live without a car in NYC, and you can definitely get by in many other cities. In addition, we are MASSIVE compared to a lot of other countries, so our towns and countryside have a lot more sprawl = requirement of cars. Trying to implement a public transportation system for the entirety of the US is way too much to ask for. That sprawl is also liked by a lot of people.

&gt; * university is too expensive for almost everybody

Sure, but we also have fantastic universities and ways to keep the costs down that many people simply don't take advantage of. I grew up solidly middle class and graduated with only $5k in student loans.

&gt; * wages for all non professionals are extremely low

This is very dependent on where you live. In large cities? Yes, absolutely. But in lower-cost of living areas, many people are at least somewhat comfortable on lower wages.

&gt; * Lack of holiday time

True - and something people are actively fighting for.

Some additional points.

* [America has some of the best and well known charities in the world](https://www.charitywatch.org/top-rated-charities)
* [America has the Smithsonian](http://www.si.edu/) - massive, FREE museums that also provide a significant impact on the research of such a variety of subjects
* [We are frequently cited as one of the top places for entrepreneurs](http://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/entrepreneurship-rankings)
* You don't need to travel outside of the US to get a wealth of culture, nature, and experiences.

**Importantly** - you are on a site that is *dominated* by the [United States](http://www.snoosecret.com/statistics-about-reddit.html). You see all of our dirty laundry spread out *all the time* - especially in comparison to other countries, unless something extreme has happened.

17,"&gt;How do courses from a course development tool get loaded into an LMS?

*Typically* you publish the course in (traditionally) SCORM or (newer) xAPI formats and either you or an LMS administrator uploads it directly to the LMS in a zipped folder. I have known a couple of LMS' that do require you to upload it to a server and input a link, but that's becoming much less common. The SCORM or xAPI file is published in such a way that it ""speaks"" to the LMS. You can set up options before you publish that determines how the LMS knows the learner has completed the course. Sometimes it's just viewing a certain number of slides, or it's completing a quiz with a certain percentage.

&gt;I assumed higher ed. would probably be the easiest point of entry with my k12 experience

I only have corporate experience so I can't say :) but that would be my personal assumption as well. However, I have worked with instructional designers in the corporate environment that came from K12, so it's definitely not impossible.

* Staff meeting
* Schedule out my week
* I'm the design lead on a project, so reviewing a draft e-learning storyboard from a consultant
* Work on my own storyboard for an e-learning course in the same series (ILT to e-learning conversion)

Tuesday

* Work on my storyboard
* Kickoff call with my SMEs (sort of backwards, typically you get your SMEs before you start storyboarding and get info from them, but it's an ILT to e-learning conversion...and I wrote the ILT...with the same SMEs. So really it's just an introduction to e-learning). 

* Work on my storyboard some more
* Attend a training session that another group in my company is looking to convert into something more blended or e-learning

Wednesday

* Continue working on my storyboard
* Meeting with some other SMEs to tweak an ILT course I created that will be delivered in a few weeks
* Design meeting for the project I'm a lead on
* More storyboarding!

Thursday

* Attending some more trainings that are considering getting converted for the same group
* Edit my PowerPoint deck once I get feedback from some stakeholders for another small ILT that I'm working on
* Mock up some e-learning activity templates

Friday

* Interview a consultant to assist with the project I'm a lead on
* Meeting with our graphic designer to turn my mockups into something prettier
* Whatever of the storyboard I didn't complete earlier

* SME meetings
* Creating/editing/receiving feedback on training materials of some kind
* Reviewing other training materials

1. Captivate is not a LMS, it is a course development tool. You build courses in it that then get loaded to an LMS. There are many corporate LMS' in existence that are very different than Canvas and Moodle (Cornerstone is a big one that comes to mind immediately). Storyline is Captivate's biggest competitor, and may even have the majority if the market now (I don't know for certain). 

2. This advice is only if you are attempting to get out of the K12 environment altogether. I know some school districts do hire instructional designers on the back end. I know that there is a need for activity ideas that can be sold to K12 classrooms, etc. However - if you are looking to get out of k12 and go into the corporate environment, K12 is just a different experience altogether. Online instruction in a k12 environment is different than in a corporate environment. You will notice some overlap, but it's important to be open to a new mindset. You are not training for academics - but to teach people new skills, etc. I would highly recommend picking up books such as ""Telling Ain't Training"" and ""Design for How People Learn.""

When I see a degree called ""instructional tech"" - I assume that you will be dealing with the development/technology that goes into courses with some introduction and basics into actual instructional design.

The schools that I have heard of having great hiring rates typically have good connections in their career center, focus on real-world application, and the students graduate with a quality portfolio ready to go. Perhaps University of Indiana has one or all of those things.

104,"* How would you divide the information you received between directly from the SME or from the Internet? Ex: 70% SME / 30% Google? Or is it 100% from the SME?

This is REALLY dependent on the course. If it's a general HR training, then I can probably glean a bit from the internet, or the SME will provide me with credible resources rather than explaining everything. However, if it's extremely job specific or complex, then I rely very heavily on the SME and will only Google very basic things like definitions - but will even run those by the SMEs. Right now I'm doing very job specific training and rely on my SMEs 99% of the time.

* How many times do you find yourself calling or e-mailing the SME for clarification on something?

I do weekly meetings with SMEs, so I typically collect any questions I have throughout the week, send them out ahead of time in an agenda (so they can choose whether they want to just send me answers or discuss it). Otherwise, I may reach out to a single SME once a week for a quick clarification piece (I typically work with groups of SMEs, only occasionally a single SME). 

* What is the process like?

The repeating of the process is just dependent on how much feedback is or what parameters you set. At one company I worked at, we limited each document to 3 drafts, any more than that was going to cost the company more. In addition, the SME is VERY rarely the only reviewer. You have a SME, but you typically have other people in the business who may also be experts check back over the work as well.

You have timelines on everything, so you have to ""repeat"" to what is reasonable for your timeline.

* Do you typically have the freedom to send out surveys to your intended audience?

Very dependent on the course.

* Any common practices you find yourself falling into when collaborating with SMEs?

Weekly meetings is my biggie, which may include reminders from the last meeting (remember last meeting we agreed to this, this, and this - therefore...)

Overall though it's really assessing how each person likes to be communicated with. Some like using screensharing, some don't. Some like talking over the phone, some like email, some like meetings, some like...etc. etc. etc. - obviously, you won't be able to cater to everyone every time, but knowing how they communicate will help in future correspondence. For example, if I'm only working with one or two SMEs on a course and they both prefer email to phone calls, I'll shorten my meetings to just being ""I am requesting this, let me explain why, I will send these requests out as action items"" - where as someone else may like meetings (or are too busy to take things offline) and will want to answer everything within the meeting.",2016-04-11 18:28:58+00:00,d1yr7hu,1.0,t3_4e7hcb,78591.0,instructionaldesign
105,"&gt;Do they understand that they're the expert in the field, while I'm the expert in training?

Yes - someone in the business would have chosen them as the SME (typically a higher up than you) and will tell them why and their purpose. If they did not tell the SME the purpose, that will be part of the reason for the kick off call (so I am creating training on X, and you will be providing the content).

&gt;I'm afraid they'll get annoyed at my questions and wonder why they shouldn't just train the employees themselves.

They won't get annoyed unless you're asking annoying questions ;). It ultimately saves the SME time that they would be out in training, and many SMEs that you will get don't want to train anyways due to personality conflict or whatever else.

&gt;The other problem I ran up against was trying to think about things to design without having access to any of the real content.

Maybe it's about creating ""snippets"" of learning? Like we give out enough content gleaned from somewhere (a book, etc) that we instruct should turn into like 3 minutes of training. E.g. a module on washing hands (not something that simple, but just as an example).

The biggest thing we want when hiring is a portfolio with samples. You're currently in school - I'm hoping you have something already produced there.

117,"A lot of people are giving awesome advice, but my biggest advice to you is start with ONE thing at a time, perfect it (or at least to the point you're happy), and move onto the next. If you try to focus on improving everything at once, you'll get discouraged when one thing is off.

My personal journey ----

First - I decided what kind of ""look"" I wanted to have. The best way I could describe it is edgy classic. Classic looks, work appropriate, but nothing frilly and lots of blacks and neutrals. Your look may be different - maybe it's lighter, preppier, etc - there's no ""wrong"" here, just helps guide you on your journey.

I happened to start with clothing because I got interested in /r/femalefashionadvice. I started choosing a style and buying towards it until I was pretty happy with my wardrobe. It's always evolving and improving, but it got to the point that I was comfortable shopping, spending certain amounts on garments I knew I'd love and keep forever and ""fit"" with my style, and resisting buying something just because it was kind of cute and on sale. During this time, my hair and makeup remained the same.

The next thing was skincare. Not really sure why. I think I was having really bad acne or something for a few weeks. Anyways - I started looking through /r/skincareaddiction and found a very simple routine that I could keep up. The difference in your skin could be slow - don't try changing lotions a lot unless you're actually getting aggravated by one over another.

After keeping my routine going for a bit on skincare - I started taking a look at tutorials on YouTube and lurking on /r/MakeupAddiction. I learned the basic things that would give me a better glow, how important (clean!) brushes were, and so on. I discovered I wasn't the only one that had weird eyelashes that caused mascara to clump easily and learned which mascara was best for me, etc. I developed a routine here, some favorite makeups, etc. Again - always evolving, but I found my routine that made me look good and anything new is just for added improvement or something different.

Now I honestly feel pretty put together most of the time. There are some minor things here and there (e.g. I want to find a scent for myself and I need to improve my jewelry selection and shoes), but my overall ""look"" is done.",2016-02-25 17:28:44+00:00,d0dgdl3,1.0,t3_47fbbn,69797.0,TheGirlSurvivalGuide

I was in Denver a few weeks ago and a friend flew out to meet me. Our only plan was to go to a concert at Red Rocks.

Someone gave us a restaurant recommendation nearby, so we went there and saw a sign for a Cider Festival close by. We caught a rockabilly band there singing about a guy who grew three arms after a nuclear bomb and was now a race car driver. Then we went to the concert and had an awesome time. The next day, we found out there was a wildlife reserve on the way to the airport so we stopped there and got to see bison and other things.

NYC is awesome, but I'd just go visit there from time to time. I don't personally the $$ is worth the opportunities/connections/etc. when the West Coast provides so much more of that for tech. If I were willing to spend that kind of money, I'd get some nice weather out of it too in SF. 

Chicago is cool. If you think NYC is ENTJ suited, I think that Chicago definitely is as well. I don't know much about their tech scene - but I feel like that's saying something. Plus it's cold as fuck there during the winter, but maybe I only care about that.

171,"As everyone else has said, that's what a SME (subject matter expert) is for. Most IDs do not know their subject matter ahead of time. I'm about to pilot a course I created on risk in finance - I have 0 background in finance whatsoever.

Here's a little e-book by Articulate about working with SMEs: https://community.articulate.com/e-books/the-essential-guide-to-working-with-subject-matter-experts

I usually have many meetings with SMEs and work on the following with them:

* Learning Objectives (90% me, 10% SMEs to confirm them - basically, what do the learners need to be able to *do* when they're done with this course)
* Content that enables learners to meet the objectives, and questions around the content  (e.g. what's the most important, what might be the most difficult to someone to understand)
* Review - the SMEs review the course to ensure everything is accurate.

YOU are the expert on making an instructionally sound and useful course - the SME provides you with the content and ensures everything is accurate.

Typically - especially for more complex courses - I set up larger initial meetings with the SMEs to go over what content is needed and get the learning objectives down pat. I'll usually put together a draft outline during the initial meetings too. They send me the content, then I sort through it the best I can. Every week, I have a SME meeting to go over how the course is coming along and to ask my inevitable questions. Then I send them the storyboard/course materials for them to make track changes and comments on. I will incorporate their edits - and repeat. Depending on how large the course is, we may have several of these review periods split up, or it will just be one big review at the end. 

I've actually never worked on a course without a SME involved in the process somewhere (unless it was something on my own time for fun). ",2015-10-11 19:24:39+00:00,cvw3d8v,1.0,t3_3o1srw,235735.0,instructionaldesign

237,"Yup! It again totally depends on what industry you work in and what you're asked to create.

Instructor led training tends to involve group activities with involvement from the instructor. E-Learning, depending on what kind of e-learning you do, is very much an individualistic type of training so creating effective individual e-learning is very different from creating effective group training sessions. Of course, if you use something like Moodle or Blackboard, you can have discussion forums and so on, but it it is still very different from the in person training.

I tend to recommend the following books:

**E-Learning**

* Design for How People Learn by Julie Dirkson
* E-Learning and the Science of Instruction by Ruth Clarke et al ([here's an online PDF of it, make sure to download because I don't know how long it will be around](http://www.nextlearning.cl/PDF/e-learning.pdf))
* Michael Allen's Guide to E-Learning (older, and he's coming out with a second edition soon so you might wait)

These books primarily deal with the type of courses that you might create with Adobe Captivate and Articulate Storyline for adult workplaces. I've asked a friend what books she recommends for academia e-learning.

**Instructor Led Learning**

* Telling Ain't Training by Stolovitch
* The Accelerated Learning Handbook by Meier

Again, I work in adult learning, so these pertain to that more but I know they can provide some good ideas for academia as well. Hope all that helps! ",2015-07-07 18:27:55+00:00,csv8yao,3.0,t1_csv32i6,8435.0,instructionaldesign

I'm starting one on Monday that will give me the opportunity to do both, though they're hiring me for my e-learning experience.

240,"There are a few niches that you can go into:

**Types of instructional design:**

* E-Learning
* Instructor Led Training
* Blended (both)

**Where to work:**

* K-12 schooling
* Academia (college)
* Adult Workplaces

Now depending your preference of the above (or even no preference at all) would help determine what types of internships to look for and so forth. Clearly anywhere with large colleges would be good for academia, anywhere with large company headquarters are good for adult workplaces, and so on.

It sounds like you're most interested in e-learning. I would highly recommend starting an online portfolio. If you're interested in the K-12/Academia route, I'd recommend getting familiar with Moodle and Blackboard. If you're interested in adult workplaces, I'd recommend looking at Articulate Storyline and Adobe Captivate, as well as general Learning Management Systems. Some schools use Articulate and Adobe products as well, but Moodle and Blackboard are definitely used very frequently. Start putting together an online portfolio of educational videos that you create and so forth.

Instructional design is a very portfolio driven career path, so regardless of what route you go, having one will greatly increase your chances of getting a job upon graduating.

As far as internships go, just try to get one in a company you like or a subject you're interested in. Instructional design transcends any ""industries"" - I've create instructional materials for medical, correctional facilities, nonprofits, and so much more.

There may be a few different types of companies you run across:

* Somewhere that you're working on internal training. This is commonly referred to as a corporate trainer. You're creating training for the company to be used and taken for the employees of that company.
* An agency. These companies create training for other companies/clients. 
* An e-learning package company. Basically they create a lot of general e-learning that's sold in packages to companies, or as an online site, etc. Think Lynda.com or Udacity. There are other ones such as Skillsoft and Relias Learning that create and sell e-learning for businesses, medical, etc. ",2015-07-03 21:49:45+00:00,csrecn3,1.0,t3_3c0wvt,8851.0,instructionaldesign
