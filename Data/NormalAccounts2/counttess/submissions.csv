Really great deal, the best I could find in the area. 

Negatives:

* No central air - window units (but nicer ones at least)
* Shared laundry in a basement (at least it's on site?) 
* Sometimes can hear people upstairs (1st floor apartment)
* Older building
* No counter space in the kitchen, but it's more than large enough to have a kitchen island and a kitchen table. 
* Small bathroom

Positives:

* High ceilings with large, bright windows
* Friendly neighbors
* Real hardwood floors
* Large rooms (besides bathroom)
* Quiet street
* Well maintained - didn't have a single issue upon move in
* No bars over the windows even though it's a 1st floor due to how raised it is off the ground level
* Older building (some people like older, some don't)
* Block away from the metro and all the restaurants on Connecticut

##I want to become an instructional designer.##

It's important to know that everyone's path is a little bit different. There are a lot of ""accidental"" instructional designers. The blog posts below give several options on entering the field.

###Getting Started Articles###

###General Tips###

1. Build a portfolio. See: [[1-Building Your Portfolio Pt 1]](https://www.reddit.com/r/instructionaldesign/comments/342ahc/how_to_build_your_elearning_portfolio_part_1/) [[2-Building Your Portfolio Pt 2]](https://www.reddit.com/r/instructionaldesign/comments/34t8il/how_to_build_your_elearning_portfolio_part_2/) [[3-Building Your Portfolio Pt 3]](https://www.reddit.com/r/instructionaldesign/comments/35l4ch/how_to_build_your_elearning_portfolio_part_3/) [[4-Building Your Portfolio Pt 4]](https://www.reddit.com/r/instructionaldesign/comments/36fccx/how_to_build_your_elearning_portfolio_part_4/)

2. Get experience by offering to create training for your current workplace, a local nonprofit, etc. See: [[1-How Do You Gain Experience]](https://www.reddit.com/r/instructionaldesign/comments/3iikky/how_do_you_gain_experience/) [[2-Changing Careers]](https://www.reddit.com/r/instructionaldesign/comments/3ie93d/where_do_i_go_from_here/)

3. Consider a degree program. There are many available - if you have a particular one in mind, feel free to post a discussion asking for people's experience at that program.

4. Learn a Tool. Most common ones are Articulate Storyline and Adobe Captivate, but programs like Camtasia, Lectora, and other video editing software don't hurt. See: [[1-Making Online Modules]](https://www.reddit.com/r/instructionaldesign/comments/32k5ph/quickest_way_to_make_interactive_online_modules/) [[2-Video Editing Software]](https://www.reddit.com/r/instructionaldesign/comments/3hlama/what_are_you_editing_video_with/)

5. Read.

6. Interact with other ID professionals. We are active on LinkedIn and Twitter especially. Check out #GuildChat, #chat2lrn, and #LrnChat on Twitter.

##Finding a Job##

The best way to get a job is to get yourself noticed. Get to know other IDs, keep your LinkedIn profile up to date, and keep your blog/portfolio sparkling.

Feel free to comment on any one small piece, or all of it.

* [Police need training on chokeholds](http://wamu.org/news/15/08/12/dc_police_need_training_on_use_of_chokeholds_report_says)

""Officers were receiving no training on any kind of neck restraints at the academy,"" Michael Tobin, Executive Director of OPC, said. ""And we also  discovered that the MPD policy does not restrict the type of holds, does not describe which type of hold is outlawed and illegal.""

It's interesting that we're really only hearing about this now based on how much this has been in the news lately. They cite a lot of issues of finding time due to being short handed and so on. 

How would you address their issues? How do you think you'd design the training?

* [NFL has created training to combat domestic violence](http://wamu.org/programs/morning_edition/15/08/12/nfls_effort_to_combat_domestic_violence_may_go_for_the_long_game)

This was created in response to the Ray Rice situation. This was interesting to listen to on the radio because there were a lot of concerns about how effective the training actually was. In addition, NFL players were less likely to be domestic abusers than the general population - they're just higher profile.

Personally, I don't think that training is the right path for this situation, unless it's how to report/help someone you think may be a victim. Instead, I think providing services like asylum for domestic partners who are victims of abuse would be a more effective strategy.

What do you think? Do you think you would do training for NFL players or something else?

* [Curbing Sexual Assault Becomes a Big Business on Campus](http://www.mprnews.org/story/2015/08/12/npr-campus-sexual-assault)

The age of political correctness, I guess. The business of providing training (for the sake of 'doing training') has become a big business on campuses. There's a lot in this that I feel like is entirely ineffective and is entirely about making the colleges feel good about themselves and their ""efforts"" in curbing sexual assault.

Thoughts? How would you approach this kind of training? Would you even do training?
