85,"Honestly, I started feeling like this about my two best friends years ago. Turns out, I was right. More so about the smack talking than the making plans without me. I still love them and enjoy spending time with them and the memories that we've created over the years, however I wouldn't trust them as far as I can throw them. Sometimes your gut instinct is correct! I've dealt with it by making new friends and having genuine people that I can divulge my thoughts to knowing they aren't going to make fun of me behind my back. I keep my other friends at arms reach, not telling them everything about my life. And frankly not caring what they do with or without me. It's actually made my life so much easier and made me so much happier. I would finally suggest that it's just a part of life that we go through, some times it's okay letting go of friends.

99,Was this incident while the killings were taking place or after? If I am thinking correctly- the killings weren't even thought to be connected until the second child was found and I don't think it was thought to be a serial killer until the third body. (Which side note- it's now a common thought that it wasn't a serial killer at all). Did your dad and uncle ever call the cops? If they thought it really was the OCCK to the point that they smashed a window in I feel as if a call the police is essential. ,2016-06-22 11:51:26+00:00,d4j92ze,1.0,t3_4oz136,162828.0,LetsNotMeet
