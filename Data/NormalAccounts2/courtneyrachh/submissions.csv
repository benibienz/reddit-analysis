I feel like an outlier because I frankly feel like it's been covered so many times that there is literally nothing new to discover or discuss. This case couldn't be less interesting to me. I have to know what the general consensus is on this sub. It irks me so much when people ask for topics to cover regarding true crime and most Maura always comes up. 

Please, be honest! And if you're one of the people who are still intrigued by the case, share your opinion too! Maybe it will start to make sense to me. ",UnresolvedMysteries,Maura Murray - Why the hype?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/52x61f/maura_murray_why_the_hype/
