90,"Hey all, two questions for you today: 

First one is about Sheyrah's Posting operations for transmog: what's the method to the madness behind min/max pricing? 

Here's what I mean:

Group|Min|Max|Normal
:--|:--|:--|:--
0-500|40% avg|100% avg|70% avg
500-1000|50% avg|100% avg|70% avg
1000-5000|50% avg|150% avg|100% avg
5k-20k|70% avg|150% avg|100% avg
20k-50k|80% avg|150% avg|100% avg
100k-250k|95% avg|200% avg|150% avg
250k-500k|95% avg|200% avg|125% avg (accident?)
500k-1000k|95% avg|200% avg|150% avg

Clearly there is a pattern of the %s increasing as the value of the item increases, but I guess I'm curious as to why. Why would I want to post a piece of gear that's worth 1000g as low as 50% of that, or conversely, if someone else has posted above maximum, why would I want to list it at 70%? Is the thought that a piece of transmog listed at 70% is much more likely to sell than one listed at 100?

Second: how is Region Avg Daily Sold calculated? I'd love to know how to intelligently weigh whether or not a piece of old world tailoring actually sells. It seems like 1 seller on my server has listed 1 of every vanilla crafted item for a very high price, but it doesn't seem like something worth investing time in undercutting if they never actually sell.

Is it necessary to wait for a TSM desktop update before reposting items you've sniped/bought to allow the databases to adjust for what's available?

Use case: I see a Large Prismatic Shard selling for 1c, region sale avg is 12g. I buy it. If I then run an Auctioning scan, will the database still think there's one for sale at 1c and return something like, ""Below minimum price"" and thus skip the posting? Or will it recognize that particular item is no longer available? When I hover over the item, I see ""8 auctions (37 min 47s ago), so it feels like the scan WILL think that the unit I purchased is still available.

""Did not post [Maelstrom Crystal] because your minimum price (max (105% avgbuy, 90%avg(dbmarket, dbmarket, dbhistorical, dbregionmarketavg))) is invalid.""

I have read that ""avgbuy"" and ""avgsell"" can be an issue if you have no record of either. Another example is for setting the Primal Spirit price, I had to delete all the references to avgbuy of herbs (avgbuy(item:109124)) and just go with the dbmarket values - it refused to work otherwise. 

I just want to confirm that I'm not missing anything. In her PasteBin she says, 
&gt; For those of you that don't go buy 1 of each current expansion herb, I have a backup in the string to just reference the market value of herbs on your server. I had to put this back up in there because too many people were getting lost with tsm not showing a price for primal spirits because they didn't know they had to buy 1 of each current expansion herb.

But that didn't seem to work, I had to actually delete it.

Anyway, any help would be welcome. This affects a ton (maybe all?) of her custom prices as well - they're all based on avgbuy instead of market. (Side question: why? Why not just use market?)

269,"I think it's not a perfect solution, but I don't know what would be. If you start with some baseline (I'll just pull this out of the air: 4 players = 3 gates, and 6 players = 4 gates), then having 5 players presents an issue. You are forced between rolling (say, every time gates spawn, which would increase game time; or just once at the beginning of the game, and if that's what you're doing, why bother), or just flat declaring that 5 is the same as 6.

I'm not a game designer by any stretch, but I have to think that creating a game that is equally fun no matter how many players you have must be extremely difficult. In the above ""roll when gates spawn"" scenario, I could very easily see someone then saying, ""It's bullshit that an extra gate spawned just because I rolled a 3.""

My group size varies, but when we get some Eldritch going it's generally 5 or 6.

I have a 2-monitor setup at home, and then separate from that, a laptop dock that plugs into a 3rd monitor AND one of the first two we just mentioned. So, left+mid = laptop dock, mid+right = desktop. In addition to all of that, my X-box is also plugged into that center screen.

Because of this setup, my needs are constantly changing. When I'm working from home, the laptop gets 2 screens. When I'm playing a PC game, the desktop gets 2. When I'm on the x-box, it's using the mid, and I've got the desktop on the right. 

And finally, the question: Does Rainmeter have the capability to adjust for the above situations on the fly? Ie, I set up 3 different configurations, and based on what's plugged in and turned on, Rainmeter can adapt? Or would I need to manually switch between layouts?

Then, I lost those, and bought a replacement pair. The Velcro on the wrists failed, so I sent them back for another pair. The Velcro on those failed, and I gave up. Then some great deal came along (some kind of 2 pairs for less than the price of 1), so I figured maybe I just had bad luck, and ordered. Both have horrible Velcro. I should probably stop using the term ""Velcro"" because I'm reasonably sure it's not.

Huge bummer because I loved the first pair. They were rugged as hell, and held up great for 12 hours of bear crawls, log carries, and the like. 

I know they have a separate line of gloves that use elastic (I assume) that I haven't tried yet. I would definitely recommend swinging through an AutoZone or Lowe's or something and trying them on before you order a pair online. Maybe I just had terrible luck and got the only 4 bad pairs they've ever made, but when the clasp flips open when I'm doing nothing more strenuous than turning a steering wheel, that's pretty unacceptable.

448,"You just described me exactly, except I'm probably just regular-fat, not skinny-fat. (29 years old, 6'0"", ~205 lbs.)

If you hate exercise but enjoy walking, and are open to a suggestion, consider [rucking](http://www.goruck.com/fitness-benefits/c/83). Short version: get a backpack with a frame, throw some weight in it, go for a walk. Lower weight and shorter walks at first, build up both over time. 

A couple years ago, I did a [GoRuck Challenge](http://www.goruck.com/tough/c/25) that pushed me beyond what I thought I was capable of. I trained for 6 weeks leading up to it and STILL within about 90 minutes or so was ready to tap out. The guy leading it told me to suck it up and get back in line, I did, and 11 hours later was so happy I stuck it out. 

I hate running - I find it super boring, I get depressed with how slow I'm moving, so I start to sprint, then get burnt out, so I walk, then get pissed that I'm walking, so I try to make up for it by sprinting. (On the one hand, interval training is actually good, but on the other, my overall distance is a joke because of this approach.) BUT, when I go for a nice long ruck (anything over 1 hour is awesome, at a 4.0mph pace), I can throw in the headphones, listen to a podcast (The Nerdist, Just OK Gamers, Crit Juice), or a book on tape, and before I know it I've walked 8 miles, and I'm sweating my dick off. It *really* feels like I'm accomplishing much more doing this than going for a ""run."" Yes, it will take much more time, but if you're someone who enjoys listening to podcasts or books, it flies by. 

Anyway, just my two cents. Good luck with everything. ",2015-07-22 20:45:55+00:00,ctck6ex,3.0,t1_ctcbz80,11494.0,videos
449,"I can't overstate the value of ""take a few seconds to think about it."" I've been public speaking in some form or another for years (lots and lots of mock trial, specifically), and people seem to think that there's a problem with actually thinking before you speak. Just take a breath, think about your answer, then go for it. 

I have also had enormous success with being extremely honest while thinking out loud. (**Disclaimer**: honesty is not *always* the best policy in an interview. For example, ""I just need a job for now while I find a place to live in another state,"" is never the correct answer to, ""So, why do you want to work here?"") That said, if you are asked something like, ""How would you approach this problem?"" the intent is to see your problem solving skills; your process. It's not a terrible idea to let them know how you arrived at your conclusions: ""Well, from what you've told me, it would seem that X. That said, I would want to know if Y is a factor, but I think the best course of action would likely be Z.""

There are a lot of solid ""serious"" board games out there - Battlestar Galactica and Game of Thrones are both excellent, even if you've never seen either show (although the GoT one in particular is MORE fun when you have a little more background.)

493,"Oh boy, that is a great question. You didn't specify, so I'm going to answer in several categories:

**Board game**: [Eldritch Horror](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/eldritch-horror/). 

If you're a board game dork, you probably know about this game, but if Scrabble and Monopoly jump to mind when you hear ""board games"" then this is probably not on your radar. Supports up to 8 players, is co-op (you all vs. the game) which is a VERY welcome relief to playing competitive games with lawyers, is very difficult to actually beat, and is heavy on the theme, which is H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos. Can't recommend enough. 

**Video game**: [Bastion] (http://store.steampowered.com/app/107100/) and also [Transistor](http://store.steampowered.com/app/237930/)

Both from the same developer - Supergiant Games - and to be fair, they have an 86 and 83 on Metacritic, so I suppose they aren't technically underrated. But, incredibly, not as many of my friends own them as I would like. (Also to be fair, I have barely scratched the surface of Transistor, but so far it's incredible). They also have REALLY good soundtracks.

**Role Playing game**: [Dungeons and Dragons](http://dnd.wizards.com/) 

It's crazy how bad a reputation/stigma this game has for how fun and accessible it is. If you want to watch the creators of Penny Arcade playing it with one of the game's devs, this is from last year's PAX: https://youtu.be/zFTmmZaD9GI (NSFW language; also this is the middle of Season 8 of video/audio podcasts. Check [this list of all the Penny Arcade D&amp;D sessions.](http://pennyarcade.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_D%26D_Podcasts)

**Party game**: [Mafia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_\(party_game\))

Super easy to learn, pretty tough to master, can be played with or without alcohol involved. Incredibly fun, I've been playing since I was 15 or so, and it still never gets old. Best with 10-16 people who can sit still and pay attention for 30 minutes at a time.

2. You'll also want to consider the color of the switches (again, see the wiki). I just realized that you didn't actually state that you're buying your first board, so hopefully I'm not explaining things you already know. 
3. That's a really good price from what I've seen. My KUL was like $130 shipped, so you're crushing it in that department.
4. I seem to keep running across people saying that they had a bum switch or some other reason they had to return a QFR, but that one was definitely on my short list. It may make the cut once I finally decide to replace my office keyboard as well.
