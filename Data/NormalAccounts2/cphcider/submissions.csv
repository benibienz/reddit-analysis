The symptoms are just complete screen freeze for 1-3 seconds on big pulls/big aoe/world bosses, etc. I even get a couple seconds of freeze when I open my bank - but there's no way this is entirely Bagnon's fault, right? People use that addon, right? 

This even occurs on Medium graphics settings. I've tried turning off just about everything, my GPU drivers are to date, I've turned off the 2nd monitor, gone Fullscreen (not windowed), etc. I'm kind of at the end of my rope. 

Possibly not related, but just in case: about 90% of the time that I have Netflix or HBO Go on my second monitor, I will get a black screen for 2-3s whenever a new episode of something loads. No idea why. 

Any thoughts?

Short story short: I lost my TF. I have no idea what happened to it, only that I farmed it for quite a while, finally got it, ran around with it equipped for a while, and then stashed it in the bank because it's no longer useful to me.

Then, in light of the BC Timewalking event, I thought maybe it would be useful to dust it off - maybe a TF is a good weapon to tank Timewalking dungeons with. Lo and behold, it's nowhere to be found. It's unlikely that I would have ever typed ""DELETE"" to get rid of it, and I WAS hacked maybe 6-9 months ago (but I never did a full inventory sweep once that was sorted out), but ultimately: I had no idea where it went.

Submitted a ticket, noted that luckily there is an achievement for acquiring this particular piece of WoW history, and under 24 hours later, I had a new one waiting for me in the mailbox. 

Here's why I'm bothering to post about this event:

Was this my fault? Probably/possibly. Did the GMs *need* to resolve my ""issue""? No, not really. But they did. It was no sweat off their back, it meant a lot to me, and here we are. 

This is how you customer service. There are plenty of examples of the opposite experience out there, but this is one reason I keep supporting Blizzard games - even if it's been 6 years without new content (or whatever the accurate number is, I may have exaggerated a little). They do that little bit extra that says, ""We give a shit,"" and I appreciate that.

So anyway, that's one guy's take. There's a lot of negativity out there, and I get it. It's been a while. And it's reasonable to ask yourself, ""Why am I subscribing?"" But for me, this is a decent reason.

http://www.sagernotebook.com/Notebook-NP9870-S.html

A little out of the ordinary, but the boss offered to get me a new laptop, and this is what I landed on. 

**Describe your problem. List any error messages and symptoms. Be descriptive.**

Some stutter during WoW and League gameplay. I'm not sure if that's the right term, but in League, basically as soon as a team fight breaks out (aka, the most critical moment when reaction speed matters), the game will lock up for .25 seconds (ish). It happens win WoW more frequently - seems to happen a lot when looting, even in low-pop areas. 

GPU is running hot. Now, I know - it's a 980 crammed into a laptop, this is somewhat expected. But when running WoW at the lowest settings, I'm around 62-63C, and around 84C on Ultra with no AA turned on at all, 87 with SSAA 4x + CMAA. (I should mention, I don't know anything about anti-alias settings, I'm just giving the ""all or none"" numbers in case it helps.

**List anything you've done in attempt to diagnose or fix the problem.**

I've tried running in Fullscreen rather than Windowed, disabling the 2nd (laptop) monitor, playing with various in-game graphics settings. But I'm not an expert. My instinct is that there should be a semi-""one size fits all"" approach when it comes to a 980 in WoW/League - maybe that's naive. 

Coming from my last card, a 460, I guess I expected to be able to run these fairly minimally demanding games at max settings without issue. I'm open to any suggestions!

I'm about to receive a new laptop which destroys my current desktop setup (thank you work for the [Sager NP9870-S](http://www.sagernotebook.com/Notebook-NP9870-S.html)). In my desktop, I have the above listed HDDs, with a couple of ancient USB 2.0 WD Essential drives (500gb and 1TB) plugged in. Currently the externals have nothing important on them - just TV/movies. I recognize they are old and probably fragile, but 1.5TB external and 2.3TB internal is not nothing. Would something like this [StarTech 4 Bay eSATA USB 3.0 to SATA Hard Drive Docking Station ](http://www.amazon.com/StarTech-eSATA-Drive-Docking-Station/dp/B004I6OCRO) for $150 on Amazon be a way to salvage all of those drives and use them as external storage? I've never used one of those docks, but I would need to take the HDD out of the My Book and put it in an enclosure, right? I don't need portability, this would be for home media center use.

I'm looking at lining up a morning haircut and shave for the day of my wedding for myself and my groomsmen. However, none of us currently use a straight razor. I have a beard and just use an electric razor to clean up the neck line; the rest of the party uses some combo of multi-blade and electric. None of us are in the big leagues.

My question is: is this a bad idea? I have only had a straight razor shave once, and while it was an enjoyable experience, I definitely experienced a fair amount of pain after. I was told this is somewhat to be expected given that my skin is just not used to that method. Basically I'm trying to avoid a bunch of guys with red bumps all over their necks in pain on the day of the wedding.

Thoughts?

I've seen this community pop up in the past, but to be honest, I wasn't a huge Amazon person at all. Well, all that has changed thanks to Prime Day. I've got earbuds, rechargeable batteries, and Rotel all on the way as we speak. How did I live before this convenience?!

A little about me: 29 year old dude working for a giant legal research company because sometimes you go to law school and then discover you don't want to be a lawyer after all. Getting married in October, so I just put the finishing touches on our Amazon registry while I was at it. 

Things I'm into: video games (League, old school JRPGs, Diablo, recovering WoW dork, GSIV), music (Black Keys, everything Jack White touches, RATM), comics (all Marvel - I'm a big fan despite barely owning any printed material; been meaning to change that - the movies have reignited the 15 year old in me), books (Shannara, Pern, Dune, Drizzt, basically all fantasy/sci-fi), Irish whiskey (I work occasionally for 2 Gingers here in Minneapolis.)

I've actually only used the Wish List as a sort of reminder of stuff I want to pick up in the future, so I apologize if it's not particularly organized (if I create multiple lists, will you guys even see them?) 

Anyway, hope that wasn't too much all at once - just excited to join and see what all the hype is about!

Cheers,

I understand that without a Kinect or IR cable, I won't be able to change channels or turn the TV on and off. What I'm looking for is JUST the TV listings from OneGuide. But, during Setup, on the screen asking me, ""Do you have a Kinect,"" and my options are, ""I have an IR cable,"" or, ""Skip,"" selecting Skip just kills Setup entirely. 

Is this working as intended? Is it not possible to at least get the listings of OneGuide unless you have one of the two options for control as well? 

I'm a reasonably tech-savvy person and it's driving me crazy that I both can't figure this out AND can't find the answer to this on a Microsoft website. Help please?",xboxone,OneGuide without Kinect OR IR Cable,http://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/3cg45u/oneguide_without_kinect_or_ir_cable/

Just picked up a One thanks to the crazy deals going on, and wanted to pick up Destiny (and expansions, and the next game, etc. etc.). Any tips on where to buy? I'm seeing the base game for $30 pretty much everywhere, but then there's some digital guardian edition, some expansion pass, etc. Just trying to avoid a Borderlands-esc DLC nightmare.

Thanks all! Looking forward to joining the club. ",DestinyTheGame,New player: where to buy the game? (XBOne),http://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/3b75wg/new_player_where_to_buy_the_game_xbone/
