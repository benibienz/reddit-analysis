71,"TLDR: Yeah, he lied. Murphy worked as an Auditor, which is like an Accountant, but in Florida it is legally and practically different. Murphy is not an accountant and in the State of Florida he is legally prohibited from advertising himself as one. #Patricklied


Longer: States have different retirements for what it takes to become an Accountant and that title holds different practical and legal weight in different states. Florida is in the tier of states that has a harder to obtain license, and where the title holds more weight. Florida has a 2-tier system where anyone could be an Auditor and can do a lot of accounting work, but there are some things in Florida that only a Licensed Florida Accountant can do - including advertising one's self as an Accountant. http://www.myfloridalicense.com/dbpr/pro/division/Servicesthatrequirealicense_cpa.html 

In order to be an Accountant in Florida you need to have pass the CPA exam with at least a 75 on every single section, complete 150 credit hours of education, including 36 hours of accounting+39 hours of business, and on top of that you have a year of work experience. Murphy did not meet those requirements. In order to be a CPA in Colorado you only need to pass the exam and have an extra semester of education or have had worked for a year. Passing the CPA in Colorado does not allow one to practice Accounting in Florida, or allow one to advertise one's self as an Accountant in Florida. I also read in politico that he tried to pass the CPA in Vermont, but I have not hear more about that. He did take the CPA in Colorado more than once. 

Its also worth noting that while an Accountant is a decent paying job that most people have generally positive feelings toward, being an Auditor usually pays less and people generally don't have as many positive feelings towards Auditors. It would make sense for a politician to want to stretch the truth both to make himself seem more likable, and to make himself seem more competent. Unfortunately he didn't so much stretch the truth as he lied. ",2016-08-29 21:50:56+00:00,d71s9wj,1.0,t3_507jd5,275.0,NoStupidQuestions

2 - I think the fact that not all of the money was paid hints strongly that this is not the case. If we really intended to give them 1.7 B, why didn't we? Why just $100 M per hostage? 

We ignored this obligation (Iranians claim its an obligation, others claim differently) for 40+ years. We never found their legal reasoning to be compelling until they started holding Americans hostage. 

Keep in mind, the White House claimed for weeks that this was all just a coincidence and that the money was going to be paid hostages or no hostages. Now they're saying the money was being held until the hostages were released.

I really like this corner of US law, so give me a second: 

Serving a foreign power does not necessarily automatically strip one of one's US Citizenship. If an American serves a foreign power a preponderance of the evidence must demonstrate that the American ALSO intended to relinquish their US Citizenship. Certain military or civil service oaths can fulfill this requirement.

HOWEVER, IF, that American is serving a foreign power which is conducting hostilities against the US or against US forces the lose of Citizenship MAY be incurred, even without such an intent. Even if one explicitly intended to return to the US, one may still lose one's Citizenship. This is the difference between fighting for the Canadians in WW2 (a large number of US Citizens did) and fighting for the Japanese in WW2 (a large number of US Citizens also did)

Interestingly an exception to this rule is serving as an officer in a foreign army - then one's US Citizenship is automatically lost. Even if it is a friendly foreign army.

In WW2 very significant numbers of Japanese-American fought for the Empire of Japan and a smaller number of German-Americans and Italian-Americans fought for their respective homelands. They all lost their Citizenship. Some sued to try to regain theirs, they lost. 

This has not been a large issue lately. Under President Bush, 2 Americans were captured in the service of Al-Qaeda (John Walker Lindh and José Padilla) For reasons that remain controversial, the Bush Administration did not attempt to strip either man of their Citizenship and tried both of them in US civilian courts as US criminals. 

Under the Obama Administration they avoid these questions by not taking prisoners and not having trials. For reasons that remain extremely controversial the Obama Administration has decided to kill Americans working for terrorist organizations without a trial (Adam Yahiye Gadahn, Anwar al-Awlaki, Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, and Samir Khan are the ones that we know about) so questions of Citizenship have not come up.

That money was sucked up from other Americans, not invested freely.

Far from being a warmongerer, he was against the war in Iraq. A war which Clinton was not only in favor of, but ENTHUSIASTICALLY in favor of. Check out the videos of her Senate speeches. 

I'm much more culturally comfortable with Clinton and she does have a lot of experience but its almost all bad experience. She brought us the wars in Iraq and Libya and Syria, all while running her illegal email server and conducting a lot of shady dealings out of the Clinton Global Foundation.

A - in English, Auschwitz is used as a by-word for concentration camps. One of the relatives may have used it as such and he may have been at/near a different camp

a1 - Auschwitz had sub-camps, some of which were of a temporary nature 

B - the situation on the eastern front was very opaque outside of the main fronts of battle. The hinterlands were left to Soviet and Axis partisan activity. (There is just so much damned land, much of it not near anything worth guarding. It was never worth the costs of stamping out small groups in these areas. There was fighting in Ukrain as late as 1956) This man could have been captured by irregular forces, which would explain the irregular nature of his captivity. (And the highly irregular nature of his release. He was very lucky to not have seen Siberia. 400,000 German soldiers were killed in the gulag and some of the survivors were not released until 1956)

C - the Treaty of Versailles was a really shitty deal and left huge pockets of ethnic Germans outside of Germany. Poland was left with a huge volksdeutsche population (that was not treated very well. One of the casus belli for the invasion was the protection of said minority.) It is entirely possible that this man was German, spoke German, lived in a German town, and joined the Hitler Youth all while inside of the legal borders of a different country. Prime candidate would be Poland.

The US has had problems with illegal immigration in the past. Deportation works. In 1954/55 we deported somewhere in the neighborhood of 400,000 illegals and about 600,000 (mostly in Texas) saw the writing on the wall and left on their own.

Ask yourself, if those 1 million illegals had stay in Texas and had children would Texas have a Republican governor right now? Look at California today and honestly ask yourself. 

This has been done in the past, it can be done now, the cost is well worth it. Rubio's plan only works if it forces the majority to leave and prohibits family reunification. If Rubio's plan puts 10 million new voters in Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, North Carolina and Virginia? Take a good hard look at California and get ready.

482,"There are freeloaders in every generation, this is something much deeper. I'm with you on responsibility. Its huge. Abandoning it and lurching toward harsh, centralized collectivism would be catastrophic. 

That being said, I would like to make the following points about the current education/economic crisis: 

Education:  

* The vast pressure to attend college that was heaped on us by our society/the government controlled education system was done to us as children. Most of us made these decisions as minors. Its not fair to ask a 16/17 year old to commit to a $200,000 decades-long proposition; they have no sense of it or how to turn down the pressure that they are under to accept it. 

* Government offered loans are responsible for the majority of the problem of college cost inflation and they are given out to people who should not receive them, who banks would not take a risk on (making the next point all the more important)

* You can't get out from under Student Loans by declaring bankruptcy. A woman starts a business, she is responsible, she has a plan, she works hard - it doesn't work out, likely for factors beyond her control - she declares bankruptcy and starts again - the bank understood this risk and priced it into her loan accordingly. That woman likely was not irresponsible. There is no such option for Sallie Mae and Freddie Mac. Once the government has you, they have you for the rest of your life.

Economic: 

* The 0% fed rate is a transfer of wealth from the middle-class to the rich. We mostly all pay taxes. A portion of those taxes go to the Fed, banks borrow for free, and a very small number of people make money in ways that benefit virtually no one. 

* Federal home mortgage tax policy, first time home owner credits, and various other sundry policies have over-inflated the housing market. Those of us who should reasonably be able to buy a modest home find them priced out of our range by these laws. Those of us who rent find that there are too few units to rent because housing companies are (understandably) focused on building the artificially more profitable houses.

* H1b visas for skilled labor and massive illegal immigration for unskilled labor are a racket that no previous generation had to endure. 

* At no point in history have so many of us been raised outside of a traditional family. Previous assumptions about family networks, support systems, and shared economic models - assumptions that our laws, tax policies, and many hiring/compensation models are based off of - are worthless for us.


Many of us have been very responsible, have worked hard, have done the right things our whole lives, and are now totally screwed. (I worked hard, I followed every school counselor's advice, I am now terrified that by the time I have climbed out of all this and saved enough to be able to reasonably raise children, I will be too old to be a parent) AND in defense of those of us who were somewhat irresponsible as teenagers: a country with no margin for error in child-development is on the road to fascism.

That system does not work. The remedy would be to either grant no refugee visas from Syria because of the unacceptably high risk (currently the policy for all other forms of US visas) or to significantly re-frame the application/settlement process. I do not know what that re-framing process would look like, but I can tell you that the current process has let terrorists into the US in the past, has gotten Americans killed in the past, and is likely to do so in the future.

Our security process is not great, and I doubt our verification methods: most Syrians do not have passports and we do not recognize the Assad government. Who will we be verifying any of this with?

These security concerns are why our embassy in Syria has stopped processing all business/visitor visas in Syria: the risk to America outweighs the benefits that that business would bring in.

And he was wholly surprised when the police thought this was a hoax bomb threat.

Did he really, at no point along those lines, think any of that was a bad idea? He was a brown Muslim sitting in English class the day after 9/11 with this thing and thought ""I should plug it in and set the alarm ...for science.""
Well of course not. He's just a boy genius. He solders CPU's and hacks into mainframes. His creativity is being hampered by an over zealous white police force. We're all just a bunch of culturally insensitive assholes. Not the Muslim kid who plugged in a (honestly) thing that looks pretty much like a bomb a day after the largest terrorist attack on U.S. soil, set the alarm and let it go off. He's just a misunderstood youth. It's those pesky school employees. I mean come on! Don't middle school teachers know proper IED identification?

I mean, it's not like anyone would gain by lying about this right? It's not like ""Stupid idiot kid mildly inconvenienced over bomb threat"" would sell any less newspapers than ""White cops oppress Muslim youth because of skin color"". 

It's not like anyone could have any ulterior motives. We all know that Islam is a totally 100% peaceful religion

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelgate

Last month 50 intel analysts broke the news to the press that the Administration has been manipulating their work since the beginning. This is the largest whistle-blower case in US history. 

The Administration would bury reports that they didn't like, and straight-up change the conclusions of some reports before handing them over for Congressional oversight. The Pentagon's Office of the Inspector General has initiated a classified investigation. I do not believe that Congress has started an investigation, though General Austin has been asked about it and there probably will be Congressional inquiries. 

I think that it has not been covered much because: 1) it is somewhat complex 2) all American news last week was dominated by the Pope's visit. 

Deliberately manipulating national-security reports to make it seem like you're not losing a war shouldn't be taken lightly. At this point, its up to the Pentagon. The Department of Justice will likely get involved, as classified material was tampered with. Congress does have the authority to investigate. Someone needs to go to jail for this.
