A free AGR account already gets you 2 points per dollar and you can buy with a different CC for cashback in addition to the AGR points. 2 - Amtrak's Tiers System works by calendar year. If one were to get the Amtrak card, should one do it at the beginning of the year to be moved into a higher Tier for the longest possible period?

I am very new to churning, apologies if I get the terminology wrong. I'm also hoping that there is something that I'm not seeing because I'd like to save more money on Amtrak. 

Part 1 - In the last 3 years I have spent around $1,800 on Amtrak. The reason that I know this is because I signed up for a free AGR account and have about 3,600 points (100 points = 1$, so the 2% back in Amtrak credit, with a few bonuses that rarely apply to me). I also bought these tickets with a 2% cash back card so more or less 4% back when riding Amtrak. 

Amtrak has 2 CCs available, one without an annual fee that nets 2 points per dollar, redeems points at 5% off and comes with an offer of 12,000 points ($120) for $1,000 spent in the first 90 days. The other has an annual fee but nets 3 points per dollar, redeems at 5% back and comes with an offer of 20,000 points. 

Outside of the bonus offers, aren't I better off getting the 2% from the free AGR account and also getting the 2% cash back from my CC? Where is the value here? I'll probably get this card eventually for the -5% when I redeem points/the 12,000 point bonus but its at the very back of the list of things I plan on applying for. Am I missing something here? 

Part 2 - Amtrak has a Tier system for points on Amtrak spending that goes by calendar year. If you have less than 5k points, you get no bonus. &gt;5K, &lt;10k = +25%. &gt;10k, &lt;20k = +50%, &gt;20 = +100%. If you are above 10k, you also get to sit in their fancy lounges for the rest of the year. 

If one was going to go for the sign up bonus (as I may, some day) shouldn't one time it so that the bonus points kick in at the beginning of the calendar year, in order to maximize the period of bonus spending on future Amtrak purchases/period of eligibility for sitting in fancy lounges? 

(Part 3 - if you travel Amtrak a lot, it could be worth it to buy points with a different CC, and redeem them at the -5% discount. You can purchase up to 15,000 points per year at the bottom 3/4 of the Tiers, and an unlimited amount per year at the highest Tier) ",churning,Amtrak Rewards cards: any better than the free AGR account longterm? And should all Amtrak Rewards cards be bought at the beginning of the calendar year?,https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/4wrg19/amtrak_rewards_cards_any_better_than_the_free_agr/

The best part of Hulu's Steven King mini-series 11.22.63 was its intense attention to historical detail. But among other things in the series, Lee Harvey Oswald shouts ""Sharpshooter!"" as he ritualistically assembles/disassembles his rifle while muttering things about his time in the USMC. - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I22Kn0srgAM


I had not heard of this before and its been bugging me ever since. A search only revealed other people also asking this question about the show - https://www.reddit.com/r/112263Hulu/comments/4rz2re/why_does_lee_harvey_oswald_say_sharpshooter/?st=iri2dubf&amp;sh=48c9318f

Joining the USMC was one of the few things that LHO ever did right and besides being a Communist, its what he was proudest of. When asked about himself his introductory statement was always that he was the only US Marine to ever defect to the USSR.

Of his time in the Corps, he was the most proud of his marksmanship. He qualified as a Sharpshooter (though he got bumped to Marksman the next year)

So r/USMC: Do US Marines ever yell ""Sharpshooter"" while assembling/disassembling their rifles? Have they ever in the past? Was this TV show even richer than I thought, or did they drop the ball?",USMC,"Do US Marines ever yell ""Sharpshooter"" while assembling/disassembling their rifles? Have they ever in the past?
