His personal hygiene was terrible. Didn't shower for days, had crust in his thinning hair on a regular basis. Didn't wash his uniforms for weeks on end, and would regularly wear shit stained whitey tighties. 

Picked his nose at quarters and was oblivious to anyone noticing. 

Was married, but wife (who had three of her own kids) controlled the money. He got $100 a month. Needless to say, he lived on the ship.

Due to funding, we all used our personal computers to do MC related shit. One day he left his computer unlocked with a folder open with some strangely titled word documents. Like real obscure but had men's names in the title. Someone got curious and opened up these documents. 

Turns out MC1 was into fictional stories about men molesting and engaging in sexual shit with minors. Like 8 year old little boys. There were hundreds of these. I doubt he wrote them because he had the literal competency of a 3 year old, but it was fucking gross. We reported him, but we were told they couldn't do anything because they were fictional. 

Someone decided they wanted to edit a document on his laptop that he wrote and ""accidentally"" opened up one of these documents. I've never seen someone freak so hard. 

Few months later he got caught beating off in the shop, then gun decking some 3M shit. He got the boot. ",2016-08-26 05:02:51+00:00,d6x555r,1.0,t3_4zm2bj,13183.0,navy

&gt; By 1900, there were no wolves in the *southern two thirds of the state*. 

&gt; Intense monitoring of wolves in Wisconsin by the DNR began in 1979. Attempts were made to capture, attach radio collars and radio-track wolves from most packs in the state. Additional surveys were done by snow-tracking wolf packs in the winter and by howl surveys in the summer. In 1980, 25 wolves in 5 packs occurred in the state, but dropped to 14 in 1985 when parvovirus reduced pup survival and killed adults. Wisconsin DNR completed a wolf recovery plan in 1989. The recovery plan set a state goal for reclassifying wolves as threatened once the population remained at or above 80 for three years.

There was no reintroduction.

Walker defunded (or prohibited) federal grant money known as ""Title X."" Title X money is legally prohibited from being used to fund abortions. This money is specifically designed to be used for education, family planning, and women's health. 

So the argument that any pro-life advocate would make based on the notion that they don't want their tax dollars used to fund abortions would be null and void for this particular action. 

The idea put forth by the republicans is that if they limit overall funding to PP, regardless of what said funding is legally capable of actually funding, they can bottleneck the amount of tax-paying-funded abortions.

Once you hit Chief, you're no longer an ""operational"" MC. Now you're managing folks. You're worrying about making sure they get online training done. You're counseling newly married Sailors. You're ensuring your Sailors are keeping their noses clean. You're a career counselor. 

You want to do PA. And as a junior enlisted Sailor you will, but it's not blatantly PA. You're telling the Navy and her Sailor's stories. So you're doing public affairs, but taking a photo, editing it and then sending it to navy.mil or dvids won't feel like it. 

Truth is, Chiefs shouldn't be doing solo PA work. That's why we have PAOs. Chiefs tend to be ""good idea"" fairies, especially in our rate, and typically have no idea how to put together a PAG.

I'm a second class. I do mostly operational. Video. Photos. Editing. But because I'm at a joint command which is made up of 5 MC reservists and 25 PAOS across all branches, I get a lot of exposure to PA work. But there aren't many billets where I am. There is only 1 active duty e7 billet. It's not common for enlisted to have done a tour at my command.

602,"This is frustrating. Not your question, in particular, but the general misunderstandings of how the water cycle/potable water ""works.""

So arguably, a lot of fresh water is obtained from aquifers. These are bodies of water, underground. The depth in which they're found varies quite a bit. These bodies of water are naturally replenished through the water cycle, but in places like CA, and soon Waukesha, the daily use of water by the population outpaces that of natural replenishment (water cycle). 

The aquifers probably contain much more water than those lakes. If there's already a threat of a depleted aquifer, from both an ecological and monetary aspect, continuing to use the resources of a stressed system has bad news written all over it.

The most prominent issue that Waukesha is dealing with is levels of pollutants in their aquifer which are deemed too high from the EPA. So even if water is plentiful, EPA says it's a no-go.
