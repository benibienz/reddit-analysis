Many of you have raised your pitch forks and brought forth the wrath of the Reddit hivemind.  
Some of you have expressed sympathy and lenience for the accused players based on the principle that counterstrike's pro scene would collapse if the accused were investigated and found to have been cheating. At the same time, the same people are against unbanning ex-IBP to, as valve stated, ""protect the integrity of professional CS""...It is mind-boggling to me as to how some on this sub have disregarded every single piece of evidence showing professional players ""aimlock"" through smokes and walls yet still to this day bitch about how ""steel and dazed r scum they took my skins"".  
CS's professional scene is **too big to fail.** With the amount of infrastructure such as ESEA/CEVO/FACEIT's (and many more) ranking system and leagues will sustain and possibly even better the ecosystem of the entire professional scene considering how many of the ""old blood"" in CS are generally against picking up anyone who isn't in the small circle of people they associate with. (my own opinion based off of observing roster changes for the past 2 years)  
We should not be expressing leniency for those who have opted to cheat and lie to their fans and the community for their own greed of greatness or money. With the direction CS is heading in with Turner and other companies looking to enter eSports, it's either **bite the bullet now and clean up the scene or watch it all blow up when companies get wind of players swindling them for the prize money.** ",GlobalOffensive,"Protecting the ""integrity"" of Counter-Strike",https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/4o0rru/protecting_the_integrity_of_counterstrike/

For the first time in history DreamHack is making it’s move into North America and the scene of the action is Austin, Texas. With over 70 million fans, DreamHack is one of the largest series of gaming events in the world.  We still hold the indisputable record for the largest LAN – almost 10,000 people brought their PC’s to enjoy the company of others, play games, and meet their stars at DreamHack Winter 2015.  Let’s show Sweden how it’s done in the states. To do that we need you to be part of our awesome crew!
 

Why? The Crew members are the true champions of the festival experience – making it possible to host world-class esport tournaments, streaming areas and expos. In order to make DreamHack an awesome gaming event, we need people that know their button smashing, network configs, worbla manipulation and hanging LED-screens! (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnTanyhWjx0)
 

DreamHack is looking for people who want to be on the ground floor of making the largest LAN party in the world and the best gaming event ever.  If this sounds like you go to  crew.dreamhack.com and register, then apply to the team of your choice.  If you have any questions email support@dreamhack.com.
 

This is DreamHack Crew
In Sweden, DreamHack crew has been around for the past 20 years – yes, that’s also how long DreamHack has been around. Each team has been refined to be the absolute best at what they do, from the cosplay to merchstore to construction teams. What’s it like? Here are some examples:
 

Construction is one of the most important teams in building the festival. Construction consists of the heroes that bring in and build the stands, booths and LAN rows that the rest of the teams later can populate. They are the ones responding first and build the foundation for the whole festival. They operate the equipment. They solve the large problems:

During DreamHack Winter 2015 the DreamHack Cleaning crew together with Steelseries hosted the competition “Get your sh** together” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bLwDOTyME

What’s the final result? What does the team effort ultimately lead to? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KGTKXh2Pa8",GlobalOffensive,Dreamhack needs volunteers for Dreamhack Austin 2016!,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/49prze/dreamhack_needs_volunteers_for_dreamhack_austin/
