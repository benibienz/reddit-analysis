3, 4 and 5.1 are glycol based hygroscopic fluids which absorb water therefore degrading their performance.  5, as you say, is silicone based hydrophobic but that doesn't mean water doesn't enter the system from the atmosphere. It does, and the water molecules in a badly maintained dot5 system group together to form small water globules in suspension. Those globules will boil at a lower temp (100ºC obviously) but more critically they freeze at 0ºC and if the frozen globule is big enough it can block a brake line completely until it thaws.  The hygroscopic properties of 3,4 &amp; 5.1 are intentional and intended to absorb these water molecules and stop this happening. Also, water globules in the system cause corrosion necessitating component replacement rather than just tossing the fluid.

All of these issues are easily avoided by changing the fluid regularly regardless of the specification of the fluid.

18,"Brake fluid is hygroscopic, meaning it absorbs moisture from the atmosphere over the passage of time. This lowers it's boiling point. If it boils locally at the hottest part of the system (the caliper) small bubbles of vapour form in the fluid behind the piston. Unlike the incompressible fluid, the vapour is very compressible indeed and reduces your braking efficiency, big time. If it's bad enough you can feel a spongy lever develop under hard braking but things are really bad at that point.

Brake fluid has 2 boiling points, dry (new fluid) and wet (contaminated).

Dot4: Dry Boiling Point 230ºC / 446ºF  -  Wet Boiling Point 155ºC / 311ºF

Dot5: Dry Boiling Point 260ºC / 500ºF  -  Wet Boiling Point 180°C / 356°F

Changing the fluid is such a simple job you should be doing it once a year if you like being alive. That measly 50 foot difference in the stopping distance could mean you don't plough into the back of an immovable object.

2 year old fluid can have 4-5% water content. Be smart. Ditch that shit. It's cheap as chips ffs.

31,"&gt;The Pitcairn government's attempts to attract migrants have been unsuccessful. Since 2013, some 700 make inquiries each year, but so far, not a single formal settlement application has been received.

&gt; The new migrants are prohibited from taking local jobs or claiming benefits for a certain length of time, even those with children. The migrants are expected to have at least NZ$ 30 000 per person in savings and are expected to build their own house at average cost of NZ$ 140 000. It is also possible to bring in off-island builders at an additional cost of between NZ$ 23 000 and NZ$ 28 000.

 &gt;The average annual cost of living on the island is NZ$ 9464. There is, however, no assurance of the migrant's right to remain on Pitcairn; after their first two years, the council must review and reapprove the migrant's status. The migrants are also required to take part in the unpaid public work to keep the island in order: maintain the island's numerous roads and paths, build roads, navigate the island longboats, clean public toilets etc. 

&gt;There are also restrictions on bringing children under the age of 16 to the island.

39,"&gt; Why does this bridge retract?

&gt;The studio was commissioned to design a pedestrian bridge to span an inlet of the Grand Union Canal at Paddington Basin, London, and provide an access route for workers and residents. Crucially, the bridge needed to open to allow access for the boat moored in the inlet.

&gt;The aim was to make the movement the extraordinary aspect of the bridge. A common approach to designing opening bridges is to have a single rigid element that fractures and lifts out of the way. Rolling Bridge opens by slowly and smoothly curling until it transforms from a conventional, straight bridge, into a circular sculpture which sits on the bank of the canal.

&gt;The structure opens using a series of hydraulic rams integrated into the balustrade. As it curls, each of its eight segments simultaneously lifts, causing it to roll until the two ends touch and form a circle. The bridge can be stopped at any point along its journey.

&gt;The whole structure was constructed at Littlehampton Welding on the Sussex coast and then floated up the Grand Union Canal, before being lifted into position and attached to the hydraulic system which powers its movement.

&gt;The Rolling Bridge won a number of awards including a Structural Steel Award, and an Emerging Architecture Award.

&gt;It opens every Friday at midday.

The 10mm dimension refers to the diameter of the banjo bolt itself which could be either 3/8'' (10mm) or 7/16'' (11mm). You should measure the internal diameter of the old banjos with a vernier caliper to ascertain what size you need. The master cylinder end and the caliper end are not necessarily the same.

In addition to that the angle of the fitting varies depending on application - 20º, 45º, 90º or straight. Again, the caliper and m/cyl ends are likely to be different.

You will also need appropriately sized new sealing washers for the banjo bolt, 2 per banjo fitting. Either copper or dowty seal type. In the appropriate diameter.

You say you can't reuse the existing banjos, I guess because the hose to banjo thread is different to what you have?  All Goodridge lines should have a 3/8'' - 24 AN-3 female thread on the line fitting and all Goodridge banjos will have a 3/8-24 AN-3 male fitting so if you stick to Goodridge banjos they will fit your line.

N.B. - Don't use the part numbers in my photo unless you are ordering from Motorcycle Storehouse, they are MCS part numbers not Goodridge.

57,"Hah memories. My first brand new hd was one of these. I'd just sold my house so was feeling moneyfied. Went up to Fred Warr's in London UK first thing in the morning to pick it up. They gave me the usual walk around, switched on the ignition, hit the start button and there was a noise like somebody was arc welding and the starter motor caught fire. So total mileage covered before the first breakdown was about 15 feet - from the crate to the front of the workshop. Way to go, AMF. Sat around drinking Fred's coffee and talking bike shit while they swapped out the starter. Eventually got out of the shop late afternoon. Rode the thing all over Europe, had it for years. It caught fire again in Le Mans France when the badly routed pos cable from the batt to the solenoid chafed through on some tinware. Got rescued by some french bikers who had a decent home shop nearby. Sorted the wiring, stayed for a week and got comprehensively laid by a cute french chick who preferred business to be conducted doggy style, which was fine by me. I remember the first thing I bought (and carted around on every trip) was a spare belt because nobody had any idea how reliable they would be. Eventually swapped it out for an Evo. Wish I still had it. Miss the french chick, too. Thanks for the memories, OP :)",2016-11-02 06:36:18+00:00,d9i1xhb,1.0,t3_5akfqm,47035.0,Harley

62,"&gt;Or those super penetrating bombs the British used

[Tallboy](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Royal_Air_Force_Bomber_Command%2C_1942-1945._CH15363.jpg)

&gt;Tallboy was designed to be dropped from an optimal altitude of 18,000 ft (5,500 m) at a forward speed of 170 mph (270 km/h), hitting at 750 mph (1,210 km/h).[3] It made a crater 80 ft (24 m) deep and 100 ft (30 m) across and could go through 16 ft (4.9 m) of concrete.

And [Grand Slam](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/British_Grand_Slam_bomb.jpg)

&gt;On 18 July 1943, work started on a larger version of the Tallboy bomb, which became the Grand Slam. As with the original Tallboy, the Grand Slam's fins generated a stabilizing spin and the bomb had a thicker case than a conventional bomb, which allowed deeper penetration. After the hot molten Torpex was poured into the casing, the explosive took a month to cool and set. Like the Tallboy, because of the low rate of production and consequent high value of each bomb, aircrews were told to land with their unused bombs on board rather than jettison them into the sea if a sortie was aborted.

&gt;After release from the Avro Lancaster B.Mk 1 (Special) bomber, the Grand Slam would reach near-supersonic speed, approaching 1,049 ft/s (320 m/s), 715 mph (1150 km/h). When it hit, it would penetrate deep underground before detonating. The resulting explosion could cause the formation of a camouflet (cavern) and shift the ground to undermine a target's foundation.",2016-10-29 00:07:41+00:00,d9c68bg,5.0,t1_d9brad5,20795.0,Whatcouldgowrong

As many others have said, it will be found beneath the finest screen in a grinder but you can set out to make it as the end product. There are various ways but here's how I make mine. All the frosty trim from fresh and dried buds, mis-shapen buds, small flower tops and what have you gets put in trays [to dry](http://i.imgur.com/2sbWUWx.jpg). It should be much drier than cured bud. As you rub it gently between your palms it will crumble finer and [finer](http://i.imgur.com/wGWnZCy.jpg). Shaking the tray brings the bits of stalk to the surface; these should be discarded as they may puncture the screen later on. [Divide it up](http://i.imgur.com/qoGwnOM.jpg) according to the capacity of the tumbler (100g/4oz in this case). Triple bag it and put in [the freezer](http://i.imgur.com/Lkax77a.jpg) overnight. This makes the crystals' bond to the plant material very brittle and it will separate easier. Ok the fun part. Speed is of the essence here. No sorry not that type of speed (though each to their own) , I'm talking about working fast, so the load doesn't thaw out. Empty a bag into [the drum](http://i.imgur.com/t1ISQpL.jpg); the screen on this is fine lab grade stuff the same as the finest screen in a grinder. [Like so](http://i.imgur.com/xxZlaMR.jpg). The lid [clips on](http://i.imgur.com/xMyi1Jo.jpg) with button magnets and carries the idler axle. Then the drum goes in the box with the square drive [engaged](http://i.imgur.com/0QoGdRQ.jpg). Switch on the motor and have a smoke whilst it [does it's magic](http://i.imgur.com/JOS2v4y.jpg). You know your reward is due when you open [the lid](http://i.imgur.com/7P86kBp.jpg).

118,"Oh yeah, I wonder if there is any video or photos of this stunt:

&gt;In the 1960s, the British defence industry saw a shifting emphasis from manned aircraft towards guided missiles, originating from the 1957 Defence White Paper by British Defence Minister Duncan Sandys. The British aircraft industry had slipped into general decline and morale in the aerial services of the British armed forces was low. Flight Lieutenant Alan Pollock, a flight commander in No. 1(F) Squadron RAF, was further displeased that no aerial displays had been planned to mark the RAF's fiftieth anniversary.


&gt;On 1 April 1968, Pollock and other members of No. 1 Sqn took part in anniversary leaflet raids on other RAF stations and on 4 April visited Tangmere, where they performed a display.[3]


&gt;Tower Bridge

&gt;On 5 April 1968 Pollock decided on his own initiative to mark the occasion of the RAF anniversary with an unauthorised display. His flight left the soon-to-be-closed RAF Tangmere, Sussex to return to RAF West Raynham in Norfolk; a route that took them over London. Immediately after take-off,[3] Pollock left the flight and flew low level. Having ""beaten up""[Note 1] Dunsfold Aerodrome (Hawker's home airfield),[3] he then took his Hawker Hunter FGA.9 (XF442) ground-attack, single-seater jet fighter over London at low level, circled the Houses of Parliament three times[3] as a demonstration against Prime Minister Harold Wilson's government,[2] dipped his wings over the Royal Air Force Memorial on the Embankment[3] and finally flew under the top span of Tower Bridge. He later wrote of the decision to fly through Tower Bridge:

 &gt;Until this very instant I'd had absolutely no idea that, of course, Tower Bridge would be there. It was easy enough to fly over it, but the idea of flying through the spans suddenly struck me. I had just ten seconds to grapple with the seductive proposition which few ground attack pilots of any nationality could have resisted. My brain started racing to reach a decision. Years of fast low-level strike flying made the decision simple . . .[3]

 &gt;Knowing that he was likely to be stripped of his flying status as a result of this display, he proceeded to ""beat up"" several airfields (Wattisham, Lakenheathand Marham) in inverted flight at an altitude of about 200 feet en route to his base at RAF West Raynham, where, within the hour, he was formally arrested[3] by Flying Officer Roger Gilpin.

 &gt;In the immediate aftermath of the incident his unit was posted to North Africa without him while he remained on a charge.[3] He was subsequently invalided out of the RAF on medical grounds.[3] This avoided a court martial and the embarrassment to the government of Pollock giving a reason for his stunt and garnering public support.[3]",2016-09-30 06:46:37+00:00,d880qzk,1.0,t3_54xhwx,134346.0,aviation

Normally over the weekend, assuming we got nicked on a fri or sat. Then you would either be let go with no charge or bailed, or taken to magistrate's court on monday morning and bailed from there.

155,"He has probably heard of the old practice of leaving fresh ('green') castings - in particular machine tool beds - outside for several years (after initial rough machining) to 'season'. There has been a lot written on this subject. I will include a somewhat lengthy (sorry) quote below, but sufficient to say it only applies to fresh castings and it won't do squat for an engine block that was cast and machined years ago.

Anyway, here you go:

&gt;An iron casting poured in a sand mold is going to have some ""locked in stresses"". The sand mold is made using sand mixed with clay and has some water content. The sand is then faced with a carbon dust (typically, powdered soft coal) to try to keep the sand from vitrifying (fusing to glass) at the surfaces of the mold contacted by the molten iron. Nevertheless, when the molten iron gets near the sand mold surfaces, there is a localized rapid cooling. This produces a stressed and somewhat harder ""skin"" on iron castings poured in sand molds. When the castings are machined, if portions of the skin are left intact while other portions are machined off, there is bound to be some ""settling out"" due to the stressed portions of the skin becoming partially unrestrained due to the machining.

&gt;The term ""Seasoned Iron Castings"" was used in advertising for machine tools and auto engines. Years ago, on a job out in Ohio, I rented a house from an oldtimer who had worked for Willys-Overland Motor Company. The oldtimer had worked for Willys-Overland in the 1920's and 1930's, mostly delivering new cars. What he did tell me was that Willys-Overland always had huge stacks of iron castings outdoors ""seasoning"". Willys, it seemed, had taken over several other smaller automakers. I think Hupmobile may have been one of them. In taking over the other automakers, Willys got piles of rough castings which they left stacked outdoors until they could figure out what to do with them. Some of the piles of castings went into engine series that Willys based on some other makers' block designs. By that point, the castings had been outdoors for several years. They found the castings machined a lot easier than ""green castings"" fresh from the foundry. As it was, Willys and the other automakers in that era did not make significant changes to the engines from one model year to the next, using the same basic block and head castings. The castings would be poured, cleaned and snagged ( sprues, gates and risers ground off). The castings would then be stacked outdoors and left there for at least a year. The weather did the rest. The oldtimer told me the belief was that repeated freeze/warming cycles plus the changes of the seasons would make for high mileage engines. In the 1920's or 1930's anyone who got near 100,000 miles on an automobile engine without a rebuild including a rebore of the cylinders thought that was remarkable. It could well be that the automakers' advertising departments figured to get some mileage out of the fact that the engine castings were left outdoors for a year or two by hyping the business of ""seasoned iron castings"". This was the 1920's and the public was a lot more familiar with seasoning of wood, so could relate to the business of ""seasoning"" engine block castings. People passing the auto plants saw the castings stacked like so much cordwood and began to wonder about buying a car with an engine made from rusted old castings. Advertising the outdoor storage of engine castings as ""outdoor seasoning"" made for good advertising. Remember, this was an era when the US was a manufacturing nation. The public in general had a bit more knowledge of how things were made and took some interest in it. Look at ads for that time period for cars- things like ""Tocco Hardened Cranksahft Journals"" or ""Superfinished surfaces"" or ""Seasoned Iron Castings"" were the kind of things that were advertised to consumers. 

&gt;At Brooklyn technical High School in the 1960's, we had machine shop teachers who had come through their time as toolmakers or machinists in industry. These guys had been around some before they settled down to teaching us kids. They told us that time along with the seasoning of iron castings or any other precision parts was a necessity to get dimensional stability. They kidded about, telling us that to make things like ""Jo"" blocks and similar, it was necessary to ""get the molecules to nearly stop moving around"". The way this happened was to let things ""season"" using time and thermal cycling. Some of the teachers told us when they were apprentices or young toolmakers, they had made their own 1-2-3 blocks, sine bars, and similar. In so doing, they left the parts out on window sills in winter weather for days or weeks, letting the freeze/warming cycling do its work. 

&gt;Within the last couple of years, I was talking with Mr. Robert Yancey out at Yancey Machine Tool. Mr. Yancey has been around heavy machine tools and heavy machine tool building for many years. We were discussing the building of heavy precision machine tools. We shared the view that the best way to insure accuracy and rigidity in a machine tool is to use properly designed massive iron castings. I mentioned that the older machine tool builders had specified that they used ""seasoned iron castings"". Mr. Yancey said the effectiveness of ""seasoning"" iron castings to get dimensional stability was debatable. He held that if iron castings are properly designed and then properly cooled, the outdoor seasoning may not really be what makes the casting so stable. He felt that automobile makers had started the idea of ""seasoning"" castings simply by having to store enough castings outdoors for a production run. At that time, as Mr. Yancey pointed out, the methods of cleaning castings were not what they are today. In addition, castings came from the foundry with a kind of harder ""skin"" where the iron had solidified against the damp molding sand. This skin also held some additional stresses. Letting the castings sit outdoors in the weather for a year or two also let some rusting of this skin occur. This rusting tended to get partially through the skin, letting the stresses in the skin relieve over much more of the surfaces of the casting than would have occurred through machining only selected areas. The other idea was that the rusting got through the harder skin,making for easier machining. 

&gt;My own sense of the things is that the best dimensionally stable castings are the ones which have been outdoor seasoned for a couple of years. During WWII, machine tool builders were cranking out machine tools from what amounted to ""green castings""- castings that had been poured only days or weeks earlier. Those machine tools went into use and held close tolerances. That would seem to blow the theory that ""outdoor seasoning"" of iron castings was a necessity for dimensional stability. Perhaps, with machine tool castings needed as fast as possible, these castings were put into a ""soaking"" furnace and brought back up to heat and allowed to normalize by slow/furnace cooling. This would achieve a similar result to the ""outdoor seasoning"". However, these same machine tools built during the WWII era simply had more massive castings to start with, so dimensional stability was easier to maintain.

184,"About the speakers. Your post had me pulling out my boxes of 'mac bits' haha. Original speakers, because of their age, have an issue with the cones' suspension ring rotting out. They're made of rubber in this case. This is common with any speaker with rubber or foam suspension. This is not the end of the world, they can be replaced, but you'll have to track down a repair kit small enough. They are 2'' and the retaining ring is secured with small cross hd screws, an 0x50 screwdriver will get them out. There are some good how-to's on speaker repair on [this site](http://www.simplyspeakers.com/speaker-repair-how-to-tips-tricks-faq.html), much more out there on the interwebs no doubt. If you were/are good at model making you're good to go I'd say, bit fiddly. Or a speaker repair shop could handle it.

Anyway back to the bits box. I have a pair of these with one cone support rotted. The one with the good cone support is the same age obviously so would be suspect, and once the supports start to degrade they affect the quality of the sound adversely. But if you don't find any locally you're welcome to have these, it would be good if they had a good home. Free as in free beer but I'm in Europe so postage might be an ouch if you're stateside; there are probably thousands of the things in the US anyway, not so common in europe though. 

If you want me to take the rotted one apart and see how easy it is to dismantle I can do you a tear down and post the pics. Here are a couple [of pics](http://imgur.com/a/AsoIE) of the speakers.

I had thought about maybe changing the drive units completely one day, either trying to track down hk original spares or using another high quality 2'' driver, as speaker tech has come along a bit since they were made, in the materials sense. But I know I'll never get round to it. So there's that idea.

It's not just that. Thousands of Spaniards living in La Linea cross over to work in Gibraltar every day and return in the evening. When the Spanish border guards are instructed to be awkward and start scrutinising everybody's ID, as happens from time to time, it's gridlock and massive tailbacks in short order, with 2-3 hour waits to cross the last time it happened. Given that the population of the rock is around 30,000 if 4 or 5 thousand people suddenly can't readily get to work then it's going to be a major problem.

294,"Hi, regarding the switches:

There's no ignition or kill switch on these. It's magneto ignition; kick it over and it sparks. The engine will run even if all the wiring and battery  is removed, so long as you leave the HT lead to the spark plug.To kill the engine you use the decompressor. Later type magnetos had a terminal on the end cap which earthed the winding via a push button switch and killed the spark, but that didn't appear until some years later.

The rotary switch on the headlamp shell is the light switch; it is the 4 position Lucas Mil Spec one size fits all. The positions are Off - Tail - Low - High. 'Tail' was for night time convoy use and only switches on the tail light so the guy behind you doesn't crash into you. Low and High were rewired since the days when the MOD ordered umpteen thousands of these switches. With the passage of time each bike is likely to be wired slightly different but on my M21 it was Off - Side (tail &amp; pilot h/l bulb) - Headlamp - same.

[This top hat switch](http://i.imgur.com/AD8Kzma.png) on the bars is the horn button. The thing to the right of it is a mirror mount with the mirror and stalk missing.

[This lever switch](http://i.imgur.com/SDtO5xm.png) is the main/dip beam for the headlamp. This is way safer than trying to reach for the rotary switch on the headlamp to dip the lights, as not only is it a long stretch but being girder forks, the bloody thing is bouncing up and down with the terrain.

This is a 6 volt system so OP needs to source 6V bulbs to suit. Using modern 12V bulbs results in a dim yellow glow. Using the correct 6V bulbs only results in a somewhat brighter yellow glow to be honest.

Here's the [wiring diagram](http://www.wdbsa.nl/download/808.jpg) in all it's glorious simplicity:)

295,"&gt; I still have to figure out these controls tbh.

The one on the left bar near the clutch lever is a decompressor to aid kicking it through when cold and also stops the engine.

The two stubby levers: whichever one's cable goes to the top of the carb, is the choke. Cable loose is choke on for starting. Cable tight is choke off. 

The other one will go to the end of the magneto (under the dynamo). That is the manual advance/retard for the ignition timing. Use this when starting the bike. [See here](http://www.wdbsa.nl/ignition_timing.htm)

The button on the carb is called the 'tickler'. Switch on the petrol tap, then push that button down and release; repeat a few times until petrol issues from the small hole under the button. This is called 'tickling the carb'.

Starting procedure on these old brits goes like this:

(By the way, they're like horses. They know when you're nervous or don't know what you're doing. You're in charge. Be sure the bike knows this.)

1) Petrol tap to 'on'. The floatbowl level will come up whilst you're doing the next bits.

2) Set choke lever for starting

3) Set advance/retard for starting

4) Tickle carb until petrol appears

5) Hold down decompressor and kick engine over a couple of times (it will be easy because no compression, the engine will not start). It will however draw some 'charge' into the cylinder (good thing).

6) Release decompressor

7) Kick the engine over putting some real weight into it and using the full stroke of the kickstart all the way to the bottom. You need to get those big ol' flywheels turning.

8) Repeat until it fires. It may fire and then die. Back the choke off a bit if so.

9) When it's running, reset the advance/retard, the engine should settle down a bit and sound sweeter

10) Knock the choke off in small increments over the first mile or so.

322,"&gt; If your club doesn't have multiple chapters, there is no need for nomads.

I would like to comment on this remark of yours. We are a single chapter european MC with a national bottom rocker. (Not relevant to the nomads theme, but to gain the right to a national rocker here - e.g., the country - you must have flown a regional bottom rocker for 10 years and then be voted to national status, unanimously, by all MCs at an Alliance (of clubs) Meeting.) We have several Nomads. A few of them are in a situation where their work has taken them to another country where they will be for a couple of years before they return 'home'. This would have been highly unusual a decade ago but with the current work situation in Europe being what it is you adapt as required. We all have families, bikes and clubs to support so you go where the money is when circumstances demand it. They travel back frequently for club events, parties, runs and the like but while they are based abroad they fly Nomads. When they return home permanently they will rejoin the mother chapter and drop the nomads altogether. In circumstances like this we advise the local dom (81 in our case) that we have a member moving to Country X for a while and they will arrange an invitation to the local 81 clubhouse where they will go and introduce themselves. Then the word will be spread, we know who this guy is, he's ok, leave him alone, extend courtesies to him when you have a party going on etc.

The other guy is a nomad because of geography. Already known to some of our fulls, he prospected from a region 500 miles away. I would be the first to admit that I had my doubts about this initially but he turned out to be an outstanding prospect. He made the 1000 mile round trip every weekend and would show up to the opening of an envelope. He has been a much respected full member for some time now. He has some hangarounds up there one of whom will be a nomads prospect shortly assuming he doesn't fuck up. This is the nucleus of a new chapter in due course, but under Alliance rules a minimum of six members/prospects is required to start a new chapter. Until such time, they are Nomads.

Different circumstances demand different solutions and there is no blanket rule covering the wearing of a nomads flash or rocker.

The *crankshaft* and the clutch. The mainshaft is a gearbox component.

&gt;on Sportsters (and other bikes) the transmission, clutch and primary drive all share one housing. These bikes are referred to as being of ""unit construction""

Err no, not quite. Pre-unit construction means the crankcase and gearbox are housed in individual, separate cases. On early machines (all marques) the primary chain tension was adjusted by moving the gearbox to the rear to tighten the chain.

Unit construction means that the crankcase and gearbox case are one single casting, or unit (hence the name). Primary chain tension in this instance is effected by means of a slipper plate, or (Royal Enfield for example) by inserting shim plates between the crankcase and gearbox case, the two being bolted together in this instance as opposed to being separately mounted in the frame.  If you can unbolt your gearbox and move it away whilst leaving the engine in one piece (all big twins) then it's pre-unit construction.

Hook up the laptop, select 'V&amp;H Short Shots' or whatever you just fitted from the enormous [drop-down list](http://i.imgur.com/bZR2qdc.png) of systems, upload a new fuel map to the unit, and that's it. Ditto for cams, air cleaners, big bore kits, yada yada. After uploading a new map, ride the bike for 8 or 10 50 mile journeys (mixed road conditions, not just a freeway blast) without shutting down and the closed loop system will evaluate the engine parameters from the various sensors and fine tune it's settings automatically. You can notice the bike settling down, running smoother and responding better to throttle inputs with each trip. After 8 rides or so it's sorted itself out and you never got your hands dirty.

429,"&gt; After googling a lot today I found some mentions of PAYE Umbrella, and if I understand that correctly they are company that technically employ you and bill your time to your client(s)

I haven't done this in Ireland as I was working in the UK at the time, and this was 20 years ago, but nevertheless it may give you food for thought.

I was working as an aircraft maintenance engineer for an airline, and wanted to leave and go on contract work. The scenario worked like this: I set up a limited company with myself as the majority shareholder. That company then obtained work contract(s) through an agency and invoiced for work done. The company had one employee (myself) on PAYE with a salary set at the minimum necessary to cover my living expenses. National Insurance was paid on that salary. Then once or twice a year I would pay myself a Director's bonus from the company's cash surplus which (the critical point) was *not* subject to National Insurance contributions or PAYE - other taxes yes, but not those two. This way I 'took home' more than if I had paid myself a higher salary in the first place. It was a long time ago and in a different country but I thought i'd mention it here in any case as another possible avenue.

431,"There wasn't really a celebrity culture in the manner of today. Rather, there were 'stars'. Sinatra and suchlike. But JFK had just visited Ireland - where I was at the time - and the whirlwind tour with the whole entourage in tow, akin to a visit from the court of Camelot, made a huge impression on all of us and our small nation was stunned at his assassination shortly afterwards. Then, frankly, somewhat stunned again when Jackie asked that the Irish Officer Cadets travel to the USA and act as honour guard at his funeral. So JFK is certainly the personage I think of when I look back on early schooldays, no doubt thanks to the saturation media coverage (such as it was back then). Woodstock caused a stir - we pored over the album sleeves. I was mortified that it had happened so soon; couldn't they have waited until I was a teenager? I was certain that the sexual revolution would be over and done with by the time I was old enough to participate; much angst. Dylan, The Beatles, The Stones, Simon &amp; Garfunkle et al all had big schoolboy appeal - parents at the time were watching stuff like the [Black and White Minstrel Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJJhLNMPXOM), I was watching The Fonz and Mork &amp; Mindy (Irish TV was big on US imports.

458,"&gt; I mean, planes do indeed get cold, but why do you think this would have an effect on them?

Well for example, consider control cables. The wire rope type that is, not the more prevalent fly-by-electric-string control systems. Down in the hangar we set the prescribed tension of a cable by adjusting [turnbuckles](http://imgur.com/a/apddj) in the cable run. Not too tight or shit breaks. Not too loose or the pilot has sloppy controls. Now go fly your aeroplane up at FL300 where it is minus whatever, or park it outside in freezing temps. Everything shrinks slightly, and the aluminium airframe expands and contracts at a different rate to the steel cables, so the cable tension goes out the window. So cleverer people than me come up with gizmos called [cable tension regulators](http://imgur.com/a/cCOzo) which maintain correct cable tension regardless of thermal expansion/contraction of the component parts (or fuselage/wing flexing in flight).

&gt;That is, don't look at them, don't talk to them, don't complain when they assault you, don't say anything when they rape your women, don't complain when they turn your nice town into a playground for the worst scum of the earth.
Frankly I think local law enforcement should take a harder line on biker gangs. And so should vigilantes, if the bikers can act like outlaws, well, remember the original meaning of ""outlaw"". We the people couldn't hold such people to law, because they're ""outlaws"". But it went the other way too...you could just shoot them dead on sight, and then the local constable would say, ""Good shot pal!"" and leave you to bury the scumbag.
Wouldn't take more than a couple of platoons to totally wipe out every biker gang in North America, I believe I'm not the only one who thinks it might improve our society in general if we remove the cancer that is biker gangs.

536,"Yeah really I should know better:) Here's a [circuit](http://i.imgur.com/0p5wetV.png) for one channel:

&gt;A power transistor T1 along with T2 forms a high power Darlington pair. The PNP transistor T3, along with the capacitor C1 and the associated resistors forms the oscillating elements.

&gt;When the unit is connected and switched ON, initially C1 slowly charges via resistor R1.

&gt;As soon as it is fully charged (within a second or so, depending upon the value of the capacitor chosen), T3 starts conducting which turns the Darlington pair T1-T2 ON, and thus the Lamps are also switched ON.

&gt;But due to this, capacitor C1 starts discharging through T1 and R4. Once it is fully discharged T1 cannot conduct, the lamps are extinguished and the cycle repeats all over again producing a flashing of the indicator bulbs.

&gt;Capacitor C2 is kept to filter out the dangerous spikes commonly present in the electrical system of every vehicle when in motion.

&gt;The value of capacitor C1 may be altered to produce different flashing rates.

575,"&gt; A plane in flight is pressurised and sealed to keep the inside at ground-level air pressure

Actually it's not. Aircraft mech here. The cabin is pressurised relative to the outside atmosphere but the pressure the crew and passengers experience is less than that at ground level; just not to the extent that it would be if the pressurisation system was not running. 
In the aircraft world we think of it as 'cabin altitude' which in [this example](http://code7700.com/images/g450_auto_pressurization_control_flight_profile_fsi_mtm_figure_21-81.png) is 6,000ft whereas the aircraft is actually at 45,000ft. From the perspective of the crew and passengers the pressure has decreased relative to that which they experienced on the ground.

The structure of the aircraft fuselage dictates how high the aircraft can climb whilst maintaining cabin altitude at (in this example) 6000ft. Every pressurised  aircraft has a Max Diff (maximum differential pressure), calculated by the manufacturer, which cannot be exceeded. Once this point is reached, if the aircraft continues to climb the cabin altitude will climb in step with the aircraft's climb. In the real world this doesn't happen as the airframes' max diffs are designed to tie in with their service ceilings and expected cruise altitudes as part of the overall design.

If you tried to maintain cabin altitude at ground level, max diff would be reached much sooner and the aircraft would be unable to climb to its (most efficient) cruising altitude.",2015-12-25 13:51:32+00:00,cyaxwnn,2.0,t1_cyah2vd,52554.0,answers

587,"&gt; Not sure how the soft tails do it, but I imagine it is the same.

The softail shocks work in extension not compression, so the lowering kit makes them longer. You have to partially dismantle the shock and change the nose piece/spindle for an extended one. [Here's one](http://imgur.com/a/yYeic) I did for a guy a while back. To convert them back to standard you have to hope the owner still has the original parts, or you're screwed.

Personally I don't get lowering softails, it just makes the bike less rideable, but if you're paying me to do it then it's fine by me, you can pay me again to put it back to standard when you figure out it won't go round corners like it used to;-)

Here's a fun fact; we can go down a whole row of rivets without talking to each other although I might be outside the fuselage with the rivet gun and my partner inside the a/c and we can't see one another. We can communicate verbally if we need to, we wear a headset and a throat microphone which is a velcro strap with two lozenge mics which sit over your larynx pointing inwards, so they only pick up what we're saying and not the noise of the rivet gun. [Like this](http://i.imgur.com/pZwUFAi.png) except us aircraft guys don't look derpy like this dude. 

It goes like this; I put the snap of my rivet gun on the rivet and wait. Partner inside puts his bucking bar on the rivet tail and pushes towards me lifting the rivet slightly out of the hole, I push back harder than him to seat the rivet head and squeeze off a burst (how much depends on rivet material type, diam and length and comes with experience). If he wants another short light burst, he taps the rivet tail lightly once with the buck which I can feel through the gun. A heavy single tap means he wants another heavy burst. When it's a good one, he taps twice which means 'that's a good one, next rivet'. A good team can go down a whole length of stringer without exchanging a word. We would only use verbal comms to change position or to drill out a rivet if the head or tail got chopped. The guy on the bucking bar's calling the shots, not the guy on the gun.

Answering the call;)

Yeah Harley dealers, independents and clued up custom shops are all over the place so no problem for tech support, knowledgeable mechanics and parts.

Hiring a Harley here just doesn't happen like it does in the States, forget that. There are a *very* few places that might (in the same way that you can rent a Ferrari) but it will cost a fortune and they will just laugh if you say you want to take it out of the country.

Buying a bike here: you will need an address (and documentary proof of it) in the country you're buying the bike in. I'm not sure how the title/plates thing works in the US but here, the bike has a number plate which is issued when new and stays with the bike for it's lifetime, unless you export it. The title document (log book) has the current owner's name printed in it; when you buy (new or second hand) that goes off to the relevant authority and in due course (a few weeks is typical) is sent back to the registered address with the new owner's name in it. Your insurance company will expect the bike to be 'normally kept' at that address and they will likely ask you that when you fill out the proposal form, e.g., Where is the bike usually parked? On street/garaged? So telling little fibs here will get you a piece of paper to wave at inquisitive cops but it will all come unravelled if you get in an accident.

Bring a bike from the states and sell it afterwards: not so simple and it's going to depend what country you sell it in. The biggest problem is that since 2003 all Harleys built to US specs have VIN nos 1HDxxx whereas Harleys built to European specs have VIN nos 5HDxxx and (this may vary from country to country) it is often impossible to import a post '03 1HDxxx as the licencing authorities just won't entertain the idea. The actual differences between the bikes are nothing a competent shop can't sort out, but that doesn't impress the licencing authorities. For the record, the differences are: different emissions regs; US ones are often tighter than ours as it happens but it's the certification that matters, not what comes out of the exhaust pipe. The other is lighting: our dipped headlight comes on with the ignition and is on all the time. Our turn signals do not double as running lights; they are single filament flashing *orange* bulbs in a clear lens, or clear single filament bulbs in an orange lens. All light lenses (headlamp, tail/brake, turn signals) must have a European approval number cast into the lens. Front and rear brakes are obligatory (no spool hubs here;) and use of either must switch the brake lights on. All exhausts (mufflers) must be type approved and stamped as such. Without all this shit the new owner will not be able to pass the technical inspection and so your bike is only worth it's value in parts (again, depending on country). Mind you that will be his problem, not yours. All that only applies for putting the bike on European plates, it does not apply if you're on holiday on US plates. But it affects the value/saleability of your bike big time, if it's post '03.

I would ship your bike in and ship it home again if I were you; have a longer tour around and swallow the shipping costs.

As Silverfox points out, the cops can give you a hard time about noise and in particular German cops and French *flics* can be anally retentive. But I've ridden in both countries, recently, with V&amp;H pipes and never got a pull; if you're obviously a tourist (foreign plates, tent &amp; baggage piled up etc) they probably won't bother you. But if you get a pull for speeding for instance, they are likely to walk round the bike and see what else they can screw you for.

Regardless of what the law says, cops here are not familiar with US driving licences and picking up an international carnet to back it up is highly recommended to save hassle.

When you've done Loop 1 you should head along the south of France and loop round Spain/Portugal, it's a lot different here than central/eastern europe, we have a thriving harley scene and guarantee our sunshine. Am in the south of spain, pm me if you're coming, we'll look after you;)

&gt;""Our University is unable to recruit and retain key people, the city hospitals cannot get enough doctors and nurses, high-tech industries like BMW and Mini are unable to maintain the workforces they need,"" Mr Price argues. ""The major institutions of the city are in danger of grinding to a halt.""
It is a vision of a city unable to function. Already the shortage of affordable homes means that 46,000 people commute into Oxford each day, workers coming from as far afield as Birmingham and Swindon.

662,"&gt; this one is set up for the stock head bolts, but substitute the correct wrench for the S&amp;S head bolts and you're good to go

Just wanted to add a comment on the 'torque wrench from hell'. Or any torque wrench with an extension. The angle between the wrench handle and a line drawn between the 'swivel point' of the wrench and the centre of the target bolt also affects the effective torque applied. If that angle is 90º, the effective torque is the same as the torque set on the wrench.

I guess a picture's worth a thousand words here as this is difficult to describe in words! [Angle A is what I'm talking about](http://i.imgur.com/XeuzIxb.png). As this angle approaches 90º, dimension X approaches 0.

The correct approach is to set the angle A so you can get on the bolt and have a clear swing to get to torque without clunking into something. Then carefully remove the torque wrench from the bolt and measure dimension X and do the math. Put the wrench back on the bolt without allowing the angle to change (notably on ratchet head wrenches) and torque to spec. Then repeat and recalculate for each bolt individually. I'm sure many people already know this, but others may not.

668,"&gt; Gas vapor is heavier than air and can move along the ground

This is the critical point imho. If you have a 5 gallon tank with a gallon remaining in it, you have 4 gallons of fuel vapour in there. As you fill up and the fuel level rises, that vapour is displaced out of the filler neck and pours downwards like an invisible slow moving waterfall, mixing with air as it goes. If the fuel vapour/air mix is at a certain ratio and meets an ignition source, kaboom. Real old carburettors (surface type) worked like that, sucking air over a pool of fuel.

He didn't work for us, was a ground handling guy with a service company we used at outstations. He drove a tug &amp; GPU a few metres up to the nose of an F27 that had just started with both engines in ground idle. For those not familiar, that's a high wing twin with RR Dart turboprops and 14' dia props. He unplugged the GPU cable (below the cockpit window on the stb side), closed the hatch, stowed the cable, hopped back in the tug and drove straight into the No2 prop. It cut the roof off the tug and chopped him into mincemeat. You can't see a running prop when you're that close, especially through a windscreen. You so need to be aware of where you are. The a/c was ferried back to us after a engine/mount/prop change and when we took the ice protection panel off there was congealed human goop trapped behind it. Pretty sobering.

752,"&gt;The decision to use a helicopter is not straightforward, and a number of important geographical, physiological, and pathological factors need to be considered.

&gt;The transfer of a seriously injured patient by helicopter may be hazardous and transportation by road may often be a safer option.

&gt;Other factors, including the clinical skills and experience of the helicopter crews, also need to be considered. Currently only one UK air ambulance, for example, is funded and manned for all its operational hours by a doctor-paramedic team trained in prehospital critical care.5

&gt;Knowledge of the resources at and journey times to local district and regional hospitals, and the location of their helipads or nearest landing sites, also needs consideration. A detailed estimate of total transport time from scene to hospital is required to ascertain whether road or air ambulance transfer will offer the fastest mode of transport to hospital. When a helicopter is requested by a ground crew already on scene helicopter mobilisation and flight times may delay transfer times further. Road ambulance transfer is often a faster mode of transport than secondary air ambulance transfer in the UK.

753,"I have a crew question I've always wondered about. If you watch any of the documentary series on air ambulance flights, there is quite often a scenario where the aircraft lands at the scene and the aircrew trauma doctor subsequently accompanies the casualty to hospital in a land ambulance.

What happens next? The a/c returns to base missing a vital crew member so presumably can't be retasked en route. How is the doctor (or paramedic) replaced so that the aircraft is fully crewed and available again expeditiously, is there another doc/para on standby who is called to the base to join the crew when the a/c lands? Or what?

What about the doc/paramedic who has accompanied the patient to the hospital by road - once handover to the hospital trauma team is completed, how do they get back to base to rejoin their crew? Jump in a taxi? They could be a long way from the base and be unable to get back for hours.

Always wondered how they get the a/c back to readiness quickly in this (seemingly not uncommon) scenario. Certainly in the UK these ops are small and charity funded and don't have the luxury of spare aircraft or spare anything for that matter.

Not with the V&amp;H design, no. The end cap stops the baffle falling out. If the screw has fallen out the baffle may have rotated so the holes don't line up any more, you'll have to pull it out to find where the threaded hole is and push it back in with the holes in line.

'Allen' refers to the head of the bolt. It is removed with a hexagonal allen key instead of a spanner. The bolts in the photos are original V&amp;H bolts and have allen heads.

Too much and you won't get it back in the pipe. Lay it on a flat surface to see how you're doing. You can wire it into place with stainless lockwire or just use several bands of paper masking tape which will burn off harmlessly inside the muffler. Slide it back in, replace bolts &amp; endcap and open a beer, you're done.

811,"It's got nothing whatsoever to do with what motorcycle you ride.  There are countless millions of people riding out there who never find themselves in bother with an MC or even meet someone that's in one.  That's because we keep to ourselves and our own circle of friends and have no interest in hassling civilians. Hell I don't really hassle anybody at all any more; I've been in the life for 40 years now  and I don't have anything to prove. We live in worlds that don't collide generally speaking, but /r/Harley happens to be one of those places in the world that the two sets in the venn diagram overlap. So you can expect the occasional post from time to time that might be of more interest to MC members than non club people who, incidentally, are very welcome to ride Harleys and that just tells us that they have good taste in motorcycles. There are likely to be as many non patched Harley riding people in our clubhouse on a Friday night as club members and with the usual caveats about appropriate behaviour understood, they are warmly welcome. We are all bikers.

*However* if someone puts (a) an MC patch and (b )a territorial bottom rocker on their cut because they think it looks cool, then they are stepping straight over the line and into our world where, like it or not, our rules apply and have done for over half a century. See your local AoC or CoC for the rules, they have a secretary for just that reason amongst others. They're not going to bite you for asking. There are countless things people can sew on their jackets or cuts that will offend nobody and you can see that at any rally in any country. MC patches are not included though, they have to be earned not bought off eBay. It is not impossible to start a new MC but that is not the way to go about it. People who did earn their patch the hard way will obviously take exception to unauthorised eBay instant 'clubs'.

&gt;Then I see this and feel that can't be true if a fucking patch can make you hate someone so badly.

I don't hate them, I don't even know them. They happen to be wearing something they're not entitled too, that's all. So they should take it off.

A few years ago here in this country there was a bar run by a late dear friend of mine Harry Hubert, a US Marine Corps vet who had been wounded in Korea. James Michener writes about him in The Drifters as it happens; the bar The Alamo in the novel is based on the real and eponymous Harry's Bar and Harry kept a framed letter from Michener discussing the name change. But I digress. It was a late night bar and used to get a good few US expats and navy guys from Rota. It was full to bursting one veterans day night when I became aware of an altercation across the bar, a pretty rare occurrence in Harry's. Turned out that some guy wearing some Marine Corps regalia and passing himself off as an ex marine got called out by two of the real deal who overheard his bullshit. He was told to take off all his badges and forage cap and fuck off, which he did, and that he was insulting Harry, themselves, and all marines living and dead, I forget how it went exactly. There wasn't a biker in the place besides myself, it was full of ordinary americans with a high proportion of ex US military, people like yourself perhaps, and nobody had the slightest problem with it and thought it was quite right and proper.

Same thing, I think you'll find.

[Edit] To tell if yours is a 350 or 500 you'll have to look at a pic where the detail of the chrome name on the bathtub is readable. If it says Twenty-One it's the 350 3TA engine and if it says Speed Twin like [this](http://i.imgur.com/Ns3X4br.jpg) it's the (much more desirable) 500 5TA

831,"Well I was born the same year as the pic was taken, 1957, so we are the same vintage:) Got my first brit bike at 14 and have owned countless Beezers, Triumphs, Nortons, etc and repaired and restored literally hundreds for other people over the decades since. The giveaway for me was the very distinctive large radius on the front of the timing cover with the little 'nub' which is the drive for the dynamo transversely mounted at the front of the engine (the magneto for ignition is at the back). That together with the correct fork shrouds and SLS front brake on the right, and the distinctive plain early post war Ariel tank badge (chrome was in short supply as the War Dept had it all, so it was kept to a minimum by necessity) and there we are!

I'm going to have a go at the other photo you posted because I'm reasonably sure I know what that is, even though there's not much to go on at first glance.

It has a very distinctive headlight arrangement. There is a flat fronted shroud covering the yokes and fork tubes, a separate faired nacelle headlamp shroud, with a piece of chrome trim where the two meet. There's only one bike that I can recall that has this arrangement, and that is an early BSA A65. Have a look at [these pics](http://imgur.com/a/1vMUw) and compare the two.

In addition to that (the petrol tank is not fitted in your pic) in front of the kid's right hand is something sticking up from the top frame tube. The A65 has a bracket on the top tube [pic](http://i.imgur.com/vPhtDuY.png) to mount the petrol tank via a bolt through a tunnel in the tank, [pic](http://i.imgur.com/BuPVQkf.png). What you are looking at here, [from the top part down](http://i.imgur.com/Sjt6dzE.png), ia a rubber bung, nut, washer, spacer tube, rubber spacer, chrome trim which stays with the tank, spacer, rubber gasket and the stud that locates in the frame bracket. It is common practice when you have the tank off to stack all these parts on the long stud and slip the nut on to keep them together, and I think that's what you can see in the photo.

In addition to that this type of headlight arrangement [pic](http://i.imgur.com/j4Nbfjl.png) was only used from 1962 - 1964 when they changed to  [this one](http://i.imgur.com/jpsLNsb.png) from 1965 onwards (now in shiny chrome, yay).

So in conclusion I am reasonably sure that this is a 1962-4 BSA A65.

[Draganfly Motorcycles](https://www.draganfly.co.uk/) in Bungay, Suffolk have been my go-to people for BSA/Ariel stuff for decades and could probably find you either of these bikes if you decided you were interested in the future. An A65 will be easier to find though.

919,"Funnily enough I punched a load of holes yesterday for some 19'' rack panels. They need a pilot hole for the through bolt so your accuracy in drilling those will determine how accurately positioned your full size holes will be. They will not distort your plate. [These are the test holes I did](http://imgur.com/a/m49nd) in a piece of gash 2mm aluminium plate to check the fit of the inserted parts. Although punching holes for conduit is a common use for them in the U.S. they are in fact general use sheet metal punches and we know them as such; [for example](http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=bl_dp_s_web_79903031?ie=UTF8&amp;field-keywords=Q.Max&amp;index=diy&amp;search-type=ss).

If I was doing your particular job I would mark out and centre punch one plate, stack the plates and clamp them together, and drill a small 1/8 approx pilot through the stack with a pillar drill or a drill guide if using a hand drill. Then open out the holes to suit the bolt that operates the tool. Then dismantle the stack and punch each hole individually. If you can't stack them for some reason (already fitted parts for example) then you'll have to mark each one out individually. Depends on how many you need to produce really. Waterjet them if there's hundreds to do.

I presume you want to change the stones? It will all come apart for sure but light corrosion has probably 'glued' it all together. Buy yourself a aerosol can of penetrating oil and apply it to the shaft where it passes through the other parts. Back the grub/set screws right out and apply the oil down the threaded holes as well. Have patience, let it sit overnight soaking. Tap sliding parts gently with a hammer and an aluminium drift if you have one. When it moves slightly, apply more penetrating oil and leave overnight again. Those bearings are called 'pillow block bearings' by the way, in case you need to replace them. They are readily available and not expensive. ",2015-06-24 06:59:01+00:00,csgtxzq,5.0,t1_csgtb5h,2087.0,findareddit
