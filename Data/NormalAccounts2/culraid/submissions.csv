About 2 months back the boxeebox went into the flashing green and red lockup phase. It had been cranky for a while before that. There's a way to force it to the recovery screen so I did that. (Power off the box, unplug the HDMI cable, press and hold the power button for around 10 seconds, release the power button, and after about 5 seconds plug in the HDMI cable back into the box. You should now see the reset options.) Did that, got the reset screen, reset all settings. Box purrs back into life and is like it is new again. Except for one issue. It has mysteriously lost the ability to handle the audio on .ts files. Only .ts files, any other file type is fine. With .ts files however, the audio is silent except for a loud distorted click repeated at 1sec intervals. A 1Hz pulse in other words. The video is fine however. Transcode the .ts file to .mp4 with Handbrake and the audio plays perfectly.

To be honest I get very few .ts files so running them through handbrake is not a huge imposition. But the boxeebox played .ts files without an issue before I reset it.  I just dropped half a dozen .ts files into handbrake prior to sticking them in the library and that prompted me to think, I must get to the bottom of this little niggle. I am at a bit of a loss how to start troubleshooting this to be honest. So I thought I'd start by asking you guys if anybody's come across this before, or maybe somebody's comment might send me in the right direction. First world mild annoyance really, but, hey.
