He was caught momentarily just inside the intake, which stopped him from being pulled into the compressor blades and turned into pink mist. His helmet and safety goggles were ripped from his head and ingested through the engine, which the pilot heard and immediately went into an emergency shutdown, which saved his life.
Bridges crawled out from the intake with minor injuries. The US Navy changed deck procedures to avoid a reoccurrence and uses footage from the incident in safety courses.",2015-07-01 13:28:14+00:00,csona59,1.0,t3_3br148,26.0,motorcycles

If not, then a low-flow grinder pump is in place and pumps into potentially a pressurized grig of other grinder pumps pumping into eventually a gravity line.

588,But in all seriousness (not trying to tear into you I swear!) what PSI's were you working with? were you packed with trip gear with you? what was the road surface like? Have you had any suspension issues on your bike? Any of all of those things can factor into premature wear. The fact that it is fairly uniform across the surface at least bodes well for you not having suspension issues.
