The thing looks immaculate. Under the hood is.. well.. how you'd imagine an almost undriven car would look like under the hood. The underbody is spotless. I don't think it ever saw a rainy day.

The owner is asking $3500 for this and I cannot wait to give up my money to him on Tuesday. Pending some natural disaster or something terrible, I'll have pictures to post on Tuesday this week!
