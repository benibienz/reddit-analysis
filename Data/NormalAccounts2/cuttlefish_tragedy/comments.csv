66,"You need to have an open, honest conversation with him - in person is preferable, definitely *not* via text. You need to ask him if he considers your relationship exclusive, and if he wants to keep it going. Be simple and straightforward, and take him for his word. Unless you have reason to believe he's lying, actual evidenced-based reason, you should trust his word. 

Relationships are all about communication. If you value this person, and he makes you happy, then it's worth brushing up your communication skills. If he's just another fling to you, and you'd rather be having sex with strangers than being in a relationship, then you should be honest with him. Ultimately, it sounds like you need to find out what he wants from the relationship, because you're uncertain.

If you look inside  yourself, and you feel that you may be the one sabotaging this relationship, it's important to ask yourself *why*. What are you running from? What are you feeling, really truly feeling? Name those feelings for yourself. Write them down. Do some soul-searching. You can even sit down and just start writing about the relationship, and see where your thoughts lead.

It's possible you have a fear of commitment, or other reason to be afraid of long-term relationships, and thus you're ""overthinking"" (aka looking for an excuse to get out).

Realistically, although limited, life is good. I don't think it's ever been better for me in my lifetime. Don't get me wrong - we just scrape by each month, and without family help we'd have been screwed a long time ago. But all things considered, life is pretty good.

How comfortable you are depends on your previous earnings. I had good jobs for a number of years, so I receive not quite $1200/mo. However, in my area, that doesn't go very far (SF Bay Area). Up until recently, my wife and I were receiving Food Stamps, which was a help (they discontinued it because now I ""make too much"" aka barely more than the value of the FS).

My Medicare premiums are paid by Medi-Cal, as well as being part of the ""Extra Help"" prescription program, which limits generic meds to $1.50 or so for a month's supply, and brand name like $3.50. With all that I take (and have had to try out), this is a hell of a benefit!

I have had to ""renew"" my SSDI, aka they contacted me saying they were reviewing my case to see how things were going for me (the judge who approved me originally had thought perhaps with good medical care I could make a big enough recovery). It involved sending in some questionnaires and letting them access updated medical information from my doctors. Unlike what someone else here said, I never was asked if I would ""sue"" them, nor did they arbitrarily cut off my Medicare. There has to be more to that story than is being told. The Social Security Administration is a pain in the ass, but they're very clear about what they expect from you and what actions they can and/or will take.

214,"Well, it's a cost-vs-benefits thing. I find the botox injections to be quite painful, and they ache for at minimum a day, usually two or even three. Botox also comes with its own side effect profile, like any treatment. That said, it stopped my migraines when nothing else could. I had migraines constantly, every day. Now, I get maybe one or two a month, occasionally more when I expose myself to triggers (like that concert). The few migraines I do get are WAAAY weaker than a typical migraine, and I almost never resort to a triptan anymore. I mostly get the ""side"" symptoms, like sound/light sensitivity, woosiness, difficulty thinking, that sort of thing. Not a huge amount of actual pain. 

For me, Botox was a no-brainer. I had to try; I'd tried just about everything else. But it worked! And works very well.

Keep in mind that you'll need at least three treatments to know if it's going to work (it doesn't necessarily work the first time), and those treatments are 10-12 weeks apart. So it's a commitment. However, you typically can continue using any migraine medications that you already take. 

Worst case scenario, you spend a bit over half a year giving it a shot, and if it doesn't work out, you've not lost anything. But if it *does* work for you, it's fantastic. It's totally worth me welling up in tears like a baby and the neurologist apologizing for causing me pain (I wish he wouldn't, I signed on for this!). I do understand that I may be a little more sensitive than most to the Botox, pain-wise. For me, every injection is like a bee sting, and the face ones are the WORST, like... well, a bee sting on your face. Still... 1000% worth it. I gladly go to my appointments, really I do, because it means having my life back from the perpetual migraine hurricane I was in.

I'd say, if your migraines are not being well-controlled by another method (like a prescription preventative), and you have the opportunity to try Botox, by all means, DO try it. It might not work, but if it does, it's like a miracle.",2016-05-17 04:58:36+00:00,d38ghu2,,t1_d37wms7,31447.0,migraine

It is sometimes misdiagnosed as conditions like Bipolar, due to rapid changes in mood and personality.

387,"It sounds like you just need a good doctor and some good evaluation. BPD can often be ""passed down"" in families as it's believed to have a very heavy ""nurture"" element (aka a mother's behavior helps shape her child's growing brain, thus perpetuating the cycle).

Have you taken a look at symptom lists for hypomania, to see if they sound familiar? [Here's a decent, if clinical, explanation.](http://psychcentral.com/disorders/hypomanic-episode-symptoms/)  In my experience, hypomania can be a little tricky to recognize ""from the inside"" while we're having it. You'll see threads on that from time to time here, ""Hypomanic or just doing well?"" ""Hypomanic or just happy?"" or even ""Hypomanic, or too much caffeine?"" That sort of thing. You get better at recognizing it with time, and since you've been through DBT you can use your Mindfulness and Emotion Regulation skills to really examine yourself and trace how you're doing. Try incorporating mindfulness meditation each evening before bedtime, and see if that helps your insomnia at all. Normalizing our sleep schedules is one of the most therapeutic things bipolar folks can do, besides medication and therapy. It's been hypothesized that bipolar has something to do with circadian rhythms, and there is clinical evidence that having a good sleep schedule is extremely helpful.

""I'm only hypomanic if anything,"" don't let that fool you! Hypomania is still a serious condition to be in! You can still do damage to yourself and your relationships, mania may simply be around the corner, and depression is always waiting with its gaping maw, ready to swallow you up out of a happy hypomanic slide. There's an entire type of bipolar, Bipolar II, which ""only"" has hypomania, but is still a serious condition to wrangle. If you're even just potentially bipolar, it's critical to watch yourself and stay in touch with any support system you have. These ""mood"" shifts can catch us by surprise, and they can do devastating damage.",2016-02-20 21:44:54+00:00,d07fekl,3.0,t1_d078tir,11872.0,bipolar

So yeah, you can totally have both, but they each require different treatment. BPD can't really be effectively treated with medication, whereas bipolar almost universally demands it.

You need a good psychiatrist and a psychologist/therapist to work all this out. Emotions being ""out of control"" can be a symptom of either condition, but they present a bit differently - Bipolar typically works in specific cycles of depression and mania/hypomania, whereas with BPD emotions are powerful 24/7, with ""swings"" usually having to do with a stimulus of some type (a memory, an emotional film, a situation you're in, an experience you have, something someone says/does to you, etc - and they're not always obvious to you without DBT training).

As a chronic migraine sufferer (currently receive Botox treatment and I'm down to a few a month), I've read and been told, repeatedly, that opiates have an extremely high incidence of rebound migraine, and that there are better options (which there are). Norco is pleasant, and definitely temporarily helps the pain, but it'll be there when the Norco wears off, and there's a very good chance I then have *two* days of migraine to deal with. Better to use an abortive like sumatriptan or even ergotamine. And for chronic migraine there are daily medications that *prevent* instead of being pain relievers,  and even treatments like what I get, strategic Botox injections every 10 weeks, at specific sites around the face, head, neck, and shoulders.

445,"You need a blood test done to check your Lithium level. What dose you take doesn't necessarily correspond to what your blood level is, and they have to guess at first. Lithium also takes a little time to get rolling, and in my opinion doesn't hit its full stride until like 6mos in. It can be impacted by how much sodium you're getting in your diet, so drastic fluctuations there can change your Lithium level (hence why we're advised to keep our normal levels of sodium and not go on a low-sodium diet without checking with our doctors first). Lithium is treated by the body like sodium.

Lithium, in my experience, helps slow the pendulum swing (from manic to depressed and back) to manageable levels. It doesn't fix *everything*. I take Lithium, but I also take perphenazine (antipsychotic) for some symptoms that Lithium doesn't entirely eliminate. I take gabapentin for a few reasons (neuropathy, anxiety, etc). And I take bupropion (wellbutrin; antidepressant) right now because I experience depression in the winter (and I lost a family member a few months ago, which didn't help the whole depression thing).

Your plateau and decline may be due to your scheduling issues, or your diet, or other factors. Or you may have simply been swinging back ""up"" and it coincided with when you started your lithium. Anger can be a normal part of depression, so I wouldn't say it's a completely separate state from depression. Lithium takes time to work, and a steady dose, after all. A visit to  your pdoc and a blood test or two, and you should have a much better idea of what's going on.",2016-01-15 04:09:23+00:00,cyytzl7,1.0,t3_410w78,8064.0,BipolarReddit
446,"I was very sick when I was in school... I've had bipolar symptoms since I was about 7 or so, untreated, so by the time I got to high school things were pretty rough. I had few friends, and I missed school regularly. They transferred me to ""Independent Study"" which was meeting with a teacher once a week and doing homework lessons at home on my own time. I tested out when I was 15 (CHSPE, California-specific). If your girl is bright, consider prepping her for the GED, she can take it when she turns 16. Then, she can go on to college or whatever your/her plans for the future are. College was SO MUCH EASIER than high school for me! No social BS, just academics and independence. I got to design my own schedule, and generally only spent a couple hours a day in class, which was much easier to manage anxiety-wise. If you have a Junior College or community college in your area, it'd be a great place for her to start. That's what I did.

Also, consider talking to her psychiatrist about her anxiety. There *are* options to help reduce it that aren't addictive. Even some mood stabilizers help, because sometimes the anxiety is sort of generated by the mood disorder, it isn't necessarily stand-alone. On top of that, a good therapist can help teach her coping skills to manage these things on her own. Both options are good, and they can compliment each other.

It's not usually rocket science, how obesity happens. Habits of a parent often, though not always, become habits of the child... and a child has no say over any of it while they're a minor, being fed and housed by an adult with terrible habits. Some parents use food for everything - to reward, to silence, to comfort. And once a child spends their whole life being overfed, they come to expect those portions as normal.

Ideally, intervention starts when they're in the womb, with the mother. Outreach can start in the first weeks of a baby's life. Intervention can happen in the toddlerhood years. But if the parent won't listen, that child is essentially doomed until they're adults. And as we all know, once we're adults, it becomes that much harder.

&gt;The first cardinal decision-making guideline in the DSM-5 diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, according to the DSM-5 workgroup, is that

&gt;when psychotic symptoms occur during a mood episode of depression, mania, hypomania, or mixed episode, the DSM-5 indicates that the diagnosis must be either psychotic depression or psychotic bipolar disorder.[2] Only when a psychotic condition lasts two-weeks continuously or longer without mood symptoms, is the diagnosis either schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder

Psychotic features means you have *some* symptoms of psychosis, but they appear as a feature of the mood state that you're in, not as a standalone diagnosis of their own.

499,"I am bipolar I, currently in excellent treatment and pretty stable. I've been with my wife for nearly 13 years. We are very happy today, and can't imagine life without each other. We're both going back to school. We're loveydovey and silly, and I can't imagine life any other way. I will love her beyond the death of the universe itself. 

That said, I was *terribly* abusive for a number of years, mentally and physically, when I was untreated (not on meds or in therapy). She's had to put up with way more than she ever should have, and to be honest, she probably should have left me at more than one point. I carry black, heavy guilt for this. We're still rebuilding certain types of trust, as she has some PTSD reactions to certain behaviors or situations (now benign). *Bipolar people can appear perfectly normal for short periods of time in such a state.* I was going into work every day in this time period, and my coworkers had no idea. Being manic and hypomanic meant I excelled at my job. Rarely did I have public problems, and they were easily blamed on something else. Years later, they still love me. They didn't have a clue. It's fucked up, man. **I** was fucked up. Psychosis is NO JOKE, and it doesn't always ""make sense"" why you get it at certain periods of the day but not others, or why bipolar people are known for being able to ""pull themselves together"" and appear normal in certain situations.

I'm not going to sugar-coat my experience. You are allowed to know the dark stuff, too.

Gather plenty of information, both personal and academic, and go into this eyes wide open. You may not encounter anything awful, but it's best to go in prepared.

You *can* find purpose in life, but first you've got to get your rollercoaster under control. Are you getting treatment? Really working at it? Are you really trying? It's never too late to try. Establish a good support system - psychiatrist, psychologist(s) (therapist), meds, understanding family/friends.

612,"I can only provide anecdata, but for example, my wife spent over a decade seeing over a dozen different doctors in Arizona and California, no diagnosis, lots of frustration, and even some harassment from doctors who thought she was ""lazy and anorexic"" or ""just depressed"". One doctor wanted her to take antidepressants, another got her dependent on pain medication, another tried to give her insomnia drugs (she did not have insomnia, or depression). Sutter was worse than useless. Then, after having just signed up with Kaiser, we got answers. A few tests at Kaiser and she was diagnosed with Graves Disease... not exactly an unheard-of condition. For the first time in her life, she's having more good days than bad, and a plan of attack for addressing her future. It's all looking up, and all thanks to Kaiser.

My own doctor at Kaiser is respectful, thorough, and incredibly helpful. My beloved psychiatrist just retired, but her replacement seems fine so far. My experience with mental healthcare outside Kaiser has been pretty awful, ranging from private insurance to low-income clinics claiming they could handle their patient-load, with waits much longer than Kaiser's. Hell, I've even seen a doctor at County mental health before, and that wait was awfully long, too. I've had shorter waits with Kaiser than with any service, private or public, short of spending a grand out of pocket to visit a fancy private psychiatrist who must be plated in gold or something. Plus, at Kaiser, I can e-mail my doctor or psychiatrist, and get meds same-day or be referred for tests, an appointment, or some other treatment. I've found that *as long as I am communicative*, I get my needs met just fine.

Btw, what you're experiencing could easily be classified as a type of crisis, so it'd be worth at least calling to see where you could get with them. Sometimes these places will have a doctor on-call who can advise you on adjusting your current dose (they usually can't prescribe new stuff).

Have you ever taken (and still have somewhere), or does your husband take, [Propranolol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propranolol)? The brand name is Inderal. It's an old medication, generic, but prescription-only. It's a beta blocker (for high blood pressure, migraines, tremor, and other stuff), and it's *fantastic* for some parts of akathisia. I have 10mg tablets and I can take up to two at a time (so 20mg), three times daily. If your husband takes it, say he takes a 40 or 60 mg tab, you could try cutting it into quarters (so a 10mg or 15mg dose, respectively). Start with the smallest dose and see how it treats you. **If you already have low blood pressure, do NOT try this.**

Do you have any [Cogentin/Benzatropine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzatropine)?

She should probably be started on a daily med to *prevent* migraines, not just painkillers. Prevention is so much better than haphazard pain treatment. There are a number of different medications to try. Different things work for different people. And even in the case that none of them work out, Botox for migraine is a very viable option.

684,"You don't have Social Security Disability, and yes, SSDI is separate from SSI.

SSDI is Social Security **Disability** Insurance. It's specifically for disability, based on your earnings, like Social Security retirement. SSI is ""Supplemental Security Income"" and meant for people in poverty, of specific backgrounds (disabled, terminally ill, elderly with no retirement income, etc). It's typically a lower amount than SSDI, though again, SSDI is earned through prior employment, so the amount you receive per month is based on your past earnings. 

SSI is for when you have no earnings to reference, or your history of earnings are too meager to grant you SSDI. People who have never worked, worked very little monetarily (sporadic jobs, minimum wage, etc), or otherwise don't have a lot of credits earned from Social Security taxes taken out of their paycheck, receive SSI. You can receive both SSDI and SSI, if your SSDI payments are low enough. (For example, the Federal SSI amount is currently $733/mo assuming you get the full amount. If you received SSDI of $400/mo, SSI would only pay $333/mo. Your combined amount would equal $733. You never get more in SSI than their max payment for your qualifying household size... unless, of course, your State is one of the ones who supplement SSI.)

I have SSDI for my Bipolar I. They will bend over backwards to help me retrain for work, I am allowed to earn up to a certain amount each month without it counting against me (haven't tested it yet), and they review my disabled status every few years (paperwork) since my condition isn't as finite as a missing hand. The system is clearly set up for disabled people of a variety of types in mind. They even have different tiers for 100% blind individuals, for example. It was a pain in the ass to get (pretty common), and ended up requiring a lawyer. Once I went before the judge, though, things smoothed out - he said it was ""obvious"" that I would be working if I could be (I've had well-paying jobs in the past), and that he hoped access to better health care would help me get back to work again eventually. He approved me.

The ""welcome package"" you reference is known as ""back pay"". If you need a lawyer, his or her fees come out of this lump sum the government sends you (they cannot charge you up front, and their fee amounts are limited by Federal law).

Additionally, meds can cause you to have extreme anxiety and be unable to sit still. That's called Akathisia, and I've been there too. It's usually treated in one of two ways - medication to help the symptoms, or figuring out which med you're on that's causing it.

Our minds run off into ""what if"" territory, and it can be very hard to get them to calm back down. Every hour is filled with anxiety and trepidation. Waiting 24 whole hours? SO bad enough! Let alone 48 or 72, or jeeebus cripes, a whole damned weekend. It makes a thousand percent sense that you're wigging out a little. And, it's going to be okay. They *will* get back to you as soon as they can, and if for some reason you don't hear from them, you can call back again. I know it's hard, it's such a hard wait. 

A great idea for times like these is to find something distracting, that takes you out of the fear, even if just for a few moments. I like to watch silly videos, or eat/drink something rich and soothing. I can't send you food, but here's one of my favorite silly videos (short and SFW) - [""This is why we don't have snow in Saudi Arabia""](https://youtu.be/8kNVqUKK4UM)   ... or watch your favorite movies/etc (I love Zoolander but I don't have a link to it), my favorite musical is (NSFW) [Twisted](https://youtu.be/-77cUxba-aA) &lt;3

Practice lots of self-care. It makes sense that you're afraid and stressed out, so be especially good to yourself.

736,"Depending on your area, there may only be one regular neurologist available, and they appear to be pretty sure you're not in imminent danger of dying. That means you might have to wait a few nail-biting days. It's pretty standard in medicine (not just Kaiser, which I have, too). They prioritize people based on how *medically* urgent a condition/scan/whatever is (not necessarily how urgent the patient thinks it is). They must be pretty confident that you're not in extreme danger right now, or they'd call an ambulance to your door bring you in ASAP. (It's happened to me.)

Try to take a few minutes to do some deep breathing exercises. I know it's scary. It makes sense that you'd be afraid and want the soonest result possible. I occasionally get Basilar Migraines, and those come along with lots of worrying neurological symptoms (they kind of mimic a stroke). Had to figure that out through a process of elimination, including an ER visit and a CT scan. I was pretty scared there for a while. And, while our fear makes sense in such a situation, it doesn't always help us out a whole lot. Doing our best to remain calm is the most likely way to get our needs met. If you haven't gotten a call/email/etc by Monday, I'd try contacting them again on Tuesday. You are going to be okay.

When there's a cyst in your brain (or close to it, along nerves), it can wreck all sorts of havoc with your thought processes, emotions, perceptions, memory, etc. It would make perfect sense to reevaluate your psychiatric symptoms once the cyst is dealt with. I wouldn't recommend jumping off-meds right now, at least not without your psychiatrist's help. 

Right now, sit tight. I know it's hard. I personally know how hard this wait is. And, you'll make it through the wait, and go from there. It's going to be okay. Remember to breath out slowly, breathe in deeply. Try to distract yourself as much as you can while you wait.

If you're taking pharmaceuticals, I wouldn't recommend playing with herbs right now. You need a doctor who understands both in order to do it safely. I had to stop using Valerian because I began taking a drug that was processed by the liver, and my psychiatrist (also a trained herbalist) said Valerian is processed by the liver, and thus she was not comfortable with me taking both, especially because herbal supplements are not regulated, particularly for potency.

A supplement also suggested for insomnia is 5HTP, but I would strongly recommend NOT using that one. There have been reports of it sending bipolar folks into mania (it can function as an antidepressant, quite effectively).

884,"Botox is what has saved me. If the nerve blocks worked for you (they're only temporary anyway), you're a good candidate for Botox, as it was explained to me. I went from daily/constant hell to 2-3 easily manageable (ibuprofen/etc) migraines a month. I'm extremely happy with the results. I get my next set tomorrow, actually! I go in every 10 weeks. It's the soonest you can, and I do NOT want to risk it wearing off. Plenty of folks do just fine on an every 12 weeks schedule, though.

Propranolol did help my migraines, to an extent. However, I'm very sensitive to its heart effects (it's a blood pressure drug, after all), and at a therapeutic-for-migraines dose, my heart was falling down to much, much too slow a rate. Occasionally it would dip into the 50s bpm range. I felt weak and sick. Not a good tradeoff. I take a tiny dose of propranolol as needed for anxiety and side effects from another medication I take that causes tremor (I am bipolar), so it's still a useful drug for me. =)

Apparently some early studies have found that Butterbur (the herb) can be as effective as some of the common pharmaceuticals when taken daily at an appropriate dose, but you'd absolutely want to check with your doctor first. My doctor wanted me to try it, but I couldn't afford it (extremely limited income). 

If you try a few meds and are still suffering, don't be afraid to ask for Botox. I know it sounds scary, but neurologists absolutely know what they're doing with it. It stings when they inject it, but the appointment is so fast (it takes my neurologist, oh, I'd guess about five minutes to do all the injections). And other than that I just go about my life, no worries, no maintenance, no daily pills (for migraine).

ETA: also FWIW, as a bipolar person, I've been on *tons* of anticonvulsants (they're used as mood stabilizers). They mostly *wrecked* me. Just awful. And didn't help my bipolar. Ended up with lithium, which I 95% love. But I also take gabapentin for anxiety and nerve pain, and it treats me remarkably well... and is an anticonvulsant. So I don't really know about the ""anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome"", because in my experience, the vast majority of them are horribly rough on *any* person's body, for whatever reason. I've spent enough time talking to other bipolar folks (and psychiatrists) to know that I'm not alone in that. Most people have bad side effects or feel quite sick on anticonvulsants. Trileptal made me sun-sensitive, triggering my dormant rosacea. They all have tricky hidden side effects, just like they have tricky hidden perks (apart from the effect of preventing seizures).",2015-08-03 00:51:08+00:00,ctpen2x,3.0,t1_ctove2p,37198.0,migraine

A lot of people with DID don't realize they have it, believe it or not. Even when they're aware of the other folks sharing their body, they don't always believe it's a clinical disorder. Many people don't immediately remember the extended trauma/neglect that causes DID to develop, and there's something of a defense mechanism that causes resistance to realizing the system is actually the result of trauma. I mean, would *you* want to believe that your kind uncle was really molesting you all those years ago? He's still alive and visits your parents regularly, after all. No no, it couldn't be true, you'd say. Confronting trauma can be very destabilizing, and the whole point of DID is to maintain stability. 

On top of that, particularly in non-Western cultures, people tend to believe their alters are spirits or entities that have entered their bodies to co-habit with them.

Realistically, I'll probably go down a few cup sizes by the end of it. They'll probably perk up more again.

I think breast size and consistency probably relies heavily upon genetics. Are your boobs mostly breast tissue, or mostly fat? This can vary, woman to woman, and would impact how much they ""shrink"" as fat is lost. There are lots of factors to consider. But the biggest one is this: does it really matter if your breasts are a bit deflated outside of a bra? Who's going to know? Bras can do wonders, and as other ladies have mentioned, some have luck with toning their chest wall muscles. Your body is the only one you've got.

991,"For me, Botox helps migraine severity *and* frequency. I was a constant/daily migraine person, pretty decently severe, episodes of Basilar migraine as well (my brother gets 'em too). I typically get Botox done every 10-11 weeks. It took several treatments before I started getting benefits, but now I typically only get a couple of migraines a month (less than 5) and they're halved, or less, in severity. As in, I don't even usually bother with a triptan anymore, I just take some ibuprofen or aspirin or something, and they actually work. And they're usually simply hormonal-triggered or if I'm exposed to a known trigger (semi-truck of caffeine, staring into the sun, etc =P ). Botox has given me my life back, and that is NOT an exaggeration.

The procedure itself? Pretty quick, very straightfoward. You go in, you sit down, you sign a waiver, they double-check your medical history, the doctor swabs your forehead and shoulders with an alcohol swab, and then s/he injects the points. After that, they dab the points with a cotton swab if they're bleeding, and watch you for a moment to make sure everything's okay, and possibly set up a return appointment. Then you're on your way! Probably about 15min at most.

It's going to sting like fuck. Everyone tries to be a hero and pretend it's ""not that bad"" and is ""just a little painful"" but thank goodness my nurse was honest. It STINGS. It's like getting a beesting injected into your face. The needle doesn't really hurt, as it's very fine, but the Botox itself STINGS and is quite cold. The worst of the pain is gone within five minutes, but that initial injection or two is probably going to surprise you if you're not prepared. It may ache/throb for a day or two afterword, or it might not. I've had both happen at different times. If you have TMJD or jaw involvement, be sure to tell the neurologist, as they add two extra shots in each jaw (but in my experience this is very helpful).

Behavioral therapies can help you understand and regulate your own moods, patterns, and behaviors more easily, and they also help you learn to communicate more effectively. 

Bit of advice I'd add for *any* SMI relationship to go well... **Take your meds. Always.** Never stop going to a doctor (change docs if you don't feel they have your best interests in mind, or are incompetent).  I did the most damage to my wife and our relationship when I thought I ""didn't need"" medication, and I've spent the last seven or so years trying to make things right (finding the right meds, getting balanced, getting behavioral therapy, and finally, starting to rebuild). We've been together for 12 years, though, so it absolutely can be done, even after major problems. It's MUCH, MUCH EASIER to PREVENT relationship damage than it is to repair!!! Swallow your pride if need be, take stuff that gives you a headache but balances you out, try thing after thing, get tons of blood tests, whatever it takes to make you feel steady enough to honestly love someone and be fair to them, it's what you have to do.
