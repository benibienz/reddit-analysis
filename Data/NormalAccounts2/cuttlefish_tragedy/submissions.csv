Nowadays it's more like, ""I do reasonably well on the few days I actually work because I'd probably not be as stable as I am unless I was mostly not-working,"" but it doesn't roll off the tongue quite as easily.

I've been steadfastly ignoring the fact that caffeine seems to be a migraine trigger for me, for quite a while. But I can't do it anymore. Between migraine and a paradoxical sleepiness, I have to give it up. If something's triggering migraine to pierce through my Botox Barrier as I like to think of it, well... clearly my body has had enough.

So, I have to give up caffeine. At least for a while. /cry

Anyone else here had to do this?",migraine,Giving up Caffeine,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/42emug/giving_up_caffeine/

I thought I was just having weird anxiety with my depression. I thought it was weird that I wanted to do creative things, like a mild urge that wasn't there before. But I'd be self-defeated before I could start. Still! Yeah. I walked right into that one. I really ought to know better by now, as this has happened before... hell, prior to Lithium I practically *lived* in a mixed state. But here I am, figuring this out on a freakin' Friday evening, so I have to wait for a telephone appointment on Monday. Bah. I *just* talked to my psychiatrist earlier this week. Neither of us figured it out. And it took getting into an argument with my wife for me to start figuring it out. (We don't really fight unless I'm messed up.)

So I'm following my old psychiatrist's advice and will be utilizing a small dose of haloperidol over the weekend. Just to even out the rough edges. It's what I have a small supply for, urgent emergencies and minor emergencies like this one.

Anyone else deal with mixed states?
