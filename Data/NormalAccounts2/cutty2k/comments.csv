1,"Ok, I'll take a shot!

This to me is not a question of rational self interest vs selflessness, it's a case of moral action vs immoral action. 

I agree morally with the first outcome; you understand that the owner of the wallet is probably devastated that they've lost it. Perhaps that's all the money they had in the world, also pulled out to buy their family presents. You imagine what it would be like to lose that much money, what it would do to you and your family. You imagine what it would be like to have a stranger return it to you intact. You practice *empathy*, and you return the wallet. This is the only moral choice.

In the second scenario, one of two things is possible. In the first, you experience the empathy of the earlier scenario but decide anyway to keep the money, even though you know and feel that is wrong. You now have to live with the guilt of that choice. That 5k may be immediately useful, maybe you have the best Christmas ever, but that doesn't change the guilt. In 3 years, all that joy is forgotten, the presents are used up, but the guilt remains. This was a negative value trade for you (given a long enough time horizon), and therefore was NOT in your self interest.

The second thing that is possible is that you don't experience empathy, you don't feel bad, you just use the money, have a great time, and never think about it again. You have perhaps been acting in rational self interest, but you have acted immorally.

Rational self interest is *useless* without morality. In my opinion, this is why there is so much debate and consternation over the rational self interest camp. Many of its ""practitioners"" lack the moral underpinning necessary to properly gauge their actions. This is the archetypal sociopathic CEO that will poison the earth and kill families with disease and pollution for profit. They have perverted the idea of self interest wth lack of morals.

To judge the concept of rational self interest against these actions would be akin to saying your sweet old lady neighbor that is a paragon of kindness is actually a horrible evil woman because she is a Christian, and some Christians kill in the name of their God. You cannot hold the proper moral practitioner for the crimes of the amoral. 

Not to harp on Rand again, because again, she had some *horrific* ideas, but her work is also often perverted in the same way. She was *very* clear in her writing that her system of ethics was *useless* without a proper moral underpinning, and yet many without that underpinning attempt to practice her code anyway, and the public at large has come to associate those amoral actions with her ethical systems, even though she was flatly opposed to their actions.

To use the Christian example again, it is a weak argument to say that *all* Christians are inherently bad and Christianity is inherently bad because some practitioners have incorrectly interpreted the message and acted immorally while claiming to be practicing the proper way. Likewise, it is a weak argument to throw out the concept of a morally aligned rational self interest because some people that practice that philosophy do so immorally.

2,"Well, I think it matters in the sense that we as a culture seem to value altruism, and yet we also don't seem to really understand that it doesn't exist. If you train someone to sacrifice their own self interest in negative value exchanges, you open them up to exploitation.

That's one of my major problems with religion; the idea that you accept suffering and hardship as a virtue in this life (altruistic self sacrifice) for some imagined gain in the next. I find that funny, because it mirrors what I said above, it just extends the time horizon of the ""payoff"" until after death.

I do agree that it's a bit of a ""head in the vat"" situation, in that, regardless of the truth of the matter, it doesn't really *matter* because our experience is what it is. Who cares if reality is objective or an illusion if my experience is unchanged.

I have found, however, that the people that *truly* understand their motivations are better off. I've borrowed money from people who gave it as a ""selfless sacrifice"" and they ended up having ulterior motivations they themselves didn't even know about, and when I failed to meet their expectations the relationship suffered. Contrastingly, I've also borrowed money from people who understood that they were helping themselves (feel good) by helping me (not get evicted) and because they were aware and ok with that exchange, they didn't impose hidden expectations on me and the relationship strengthened.

Rand was an idiot for a lot of things, but she kind of nailed the true nature of selfishness. She probably just should have used a different word, rather than co-opt one with such a negative connotation.

3,"To play devil's advocate, it's all about realizing what the goals of your choices end up accomplishing and truly understanding your value judgements.

I would argue that you *would* rather be in a cold ass soup kitchen on Sunday morning, because either you are being paid for that (and you value the money more than the game) or you are receiving positive feelings from helping people by volunteering (and you value that feeling more than the video game).

If you *truly* valued the game more than either of those, then you'd just play it.

A point by point walk through, since you seem to need the hand holding:

&gt;You assume I'm against reproductive rights and climate change and then try to pretend your comment is a neutral analysis to mine.

I make no assumptions to your personal convictions, I'm merely pointing out that you are using arguments you formulated against extreme positions (Hitler, Muslims) to respond to reasonable concerns (climate change and reproductive rights.) Commenters have said ""we think trump will be bad because of his views on climate change"", to which you respond ""yeah but people thought Bush was Hitler."" These two statements are not connected, and using one to respond to the other is a failure of logic.

&gt;If I had directly said I wasn't a conservative in my comment, most of the downvotes and knee-jerk drama would not have happened.

Nobody cares what you *say* you are, your ideas are reinforcing conservative talking points, regardless of how you self identify politically. Hence the downvotes amid your protestations of neutrality.

&gt;I don't think he was a good president or did a good job and yet because I made the assertion that he was not Hitler and that the world didn't end with his presidency, people freaked out.

No, people didn't ""freak out"", they have righty pointed out that your assertion that because the world didn't end with Bush, that no one should be concerned about trump is silly and wrong.

&gt;He's not going to put Muslims into internment camps, rapes are not going to skyrocket emboldened by a sexist douchebag in office.

Pure speculation. Moving on.


&gt;We will likely lose AHA, fail to make progress with climate change prevention, and he will likely fuck up the education budget etc, yes shitty things will temporarily happen, but the next decent president that comes along - and one will, as has always been the case since 1776 - and we will move forward again.

So because things happened a certain way in the past, they are guaranteed to happen that way in the future? Your understanding of climate change is probably not up to snuff if you think that we can afford to have ""shitty things temporarily happen to it.""

&gt;Overall our county has always improved since its creation, even if during some presidencies it was a two steps forward, one step back situation. 

Uh huh, so what is wrong with trying to do away with the ""one step back"".

Hillary is not liked because of who she is, what she represents. She is the epitome of establishment elite, part of the dynasty. Replace her with another career politician and you have the same issue. Chuck Schumer leading the Dems is a signal that the Dems haven't learned. 

You say Warren and Sanders are the most influential Dems, and by that I assume you mean that they will take the lead in shaping party policy. I haven't seen any evidence of this, and making Schumer minority leader certainly doesn't back that up.

As to balls of yarn, you're focusing on the wrong part of that metaphor. I am not saying that issues like abortion and marriage rights are like balls of yarn in that they are inconsequential. They are important issues. But, important or not, they are used as a tool for distraction from other issues that are incredibly important, but not so emotionally evocative. Few people get viscerally passionate about economic policy. 

The people in power know this. CEOs of multibillion dollar companies don't make decisions based on social policy, they make decisions that favor them economically. They are playing by a different set of rules, their value system is not aligned with ours. By playing both sides against the middle on social issues, important or not, they have been successful in taking over both sides of the aisle on economic policy. Establishment Republicans and Democrats are both good for business.

Ask yourself this; would you be happy living in a country with a vast social safety net, that limited the power of the ultra wealthy, took care of the lower and middle class, but outlawed gay marriage and abortion? You probably wouldn't, and I don't think I would either. As I said, these issues are important.

But conversely, would you live in a country that screws over the middle class, allows the poor and mentally ill to live as homeless, and bails out the top 0.001%, but let's people pee in whatever bathroom they want and have abortions?

47,"&gt;I actually think this role is fantastic for Bernie. Theorizing about policy is important, but where Bernie has really shined this year was in being able to sell ~~a~~ ***his*** vision and convince people to support it

FTFY

&gt;Trump's success came from his ability to get people to believe he was on their side, even while holding abysmal, superficial, often-contradictory policy positions, especially when compared to a Democratic Party platform that was better in just about every single way.

Unfortunately, most Trump voters don't agree with that. *Best* is a relative term, and it seems that even after this election, people don't see that 50% of the country do not agree with your views on a fundamental level. I've lived in the flyover states, go ahead and walk into a hardware store in Kansas and say ""the Democratic Party platform is better in just about every single way"" and see the response you get.

82,"Is it copypasta if I wrote it?

Long long ago, but not too far away,  
Was the land where the Spoochies frolicked and played.  
They danced through the fields, through the meadows they'd run,  
Near the stone on the hole the first Spoochy came from.

It was so long ago that no one remembered,  
The story of how came to be their first member.  
But no Spoochy cared, or gave it a thought,  
For Spoochies were hardly a curious lot.

So, when the stone on the hole gave a shudder,  
Not even one Spoochy made even a mutter.  
None of them knew what this motion portended; 
The Ten-Thousandth Day had finally ended.

Now all the sweet Spoochies were asleep for the night,  
All huddled and snuggled and bundled just right.  
Dreaming the dreams that all Spoochies do,  
Of eating floop pudding in their Spoochy canoes. 

But little Spoochina, the youngest of all,  
Awoke with a start to a noise down the hall. 
She shivered and shuddered, then slipped out of bed,  
And crept to the door with a feeling of dread. 

But with each step she took a malevolence grew,  
Erasing her thoughts of those Spoochie canoes.  
The darkness expanded and swallowed her whole,  
It crushed all her bones and tore at her soul. 

It flooded her mouth, and wrapped round her spine,  
Split open her skull and entered her mind.  
Oh! The horrors the darkness let in!  
An endless progression of madness and sin! 

She wriggled and twisted and screamed through the pain,  
But the darkness pushed deeper till nothing remained.  
For an infinite time, or perhaps just a moment,  
What once was Spoochina succumbed to this torment.

And then, in an instant, as quick as it came,  
The darkness relented and *something* remained.  
The *something* knew nothing of Spoochie canoes,  
Of snuggles and cuddles or tooty kazoos.  

Black pits for eyes, mouth like a slit,  
Dreams of floop pudding meant nothing to it.  
Nightmares composed this sinister shade,  
Murder and madness and torture it's trade. 

Joints cracking backwards the creature did rise,  
Extended its hands, fingers like knives.  
And leapt towards the bedroom with staggering speed,  
Where Brother and Sister were still fast asleep. 

It burst through the door and onto the bed,  
Snatched up dear Brother and bit through his head.  
Onto Sister fell what remained of his jaw,  
The rest of his flesh hung from *something's* black maw. 

Sister awoke to this startling sight,  
""My god, *Spoochina?!*"" she bellowed in fright.  
Through dear Brother's flesh the thing tried to speak,  
But all that came out was an inhuman shriek.

Heat blasted forth from its mouth into space,  
And melted the skin off of sweet Sister's face.  
Her liquified body sloughed onto her brother,  
As the thing left the room to find Father and Mother.

The floorboards buckled and cracked underfoot,  
Behind flowed a streak of crimson and soot.  
It licked at the smell of the sweat and the fear,  
And followed the sound of the whispers and tears.

There, huddled before it, clutching each other,  
Were the cowering forms of Father and Mother.  
Foam-flecked and wild they whimpered and stuttered,  
Pleading for mercy they wailed and they blubbered. 

They offered it all the floof pudding it craved,  
They cried out to their gods, St. Spoochbert and Dave.  
They hoped someone heard them but no*body* could,  
Just a hole in the world where their daughter once stood. 

The dark drew them in, their eyes were transfixed,  
As it peeled back its skin and opened its lips.  
Revealing the evils too deep to behold,  
From the dawn of time to the end of the world.

No Spoochy's mind could outlast that strain,  
They fried and they snapped and they both went insane.  
Clawing and biting with unholy power,  
Pop turned to Ma and began to devour. 

He plucked out her eyes and swallowed them whole,  
He gorged on her feet and chewed off their soles.  
His mouth filled with meat till he couldn't hold more,  
Then he coughed and he choked and he died on the floor.

The carnage complete, the house sat in silence,  
A hellish expanse transformed by the violence.  
The thing glided forth, slick on the ground,  
Down the dirt road and into the town. 

It poisoned the meadows, and blighted the fields,  
It burned up the lake where the floop canoes wheeled.  
It gobbled the children, and all the Old 'Nans,  
Till not one single Spoochy was left in the land.

When it was over, the thing returned home,  
To the edge of the wood, to the hole with the stone.  
It rolled back the boulder, peered into the black,  
And slunk down the hole, to never look back.

Deeper and deeper, down the pit oh so vile,  
It sank to the bottom and spat out the child.  
Blinded by agony, she writhed in the dirt,  
The last of the Spoochies, just madness and hurt.

No one can say for how long she lie,   
At the bottom of the earth, or how she survived.  
But through some cruel twist of fate she lived,  
And then up from the depths of her gut sprang *him.* 

Perfectly pink, fat as a lamb,  
Happy and bouncy and ready to jam.  
A wee baby Spoochy, a picture of health,  
Had somehow emerged from inside herself.

She reeled back in shock and clutched at her chest,   
To see such a pure thing to her was grotesque.  
Her mind warped by all of the torment she'd seen,  
She flung him away with a jerk and a scream.

Up, up, through the earth he flew,  
Above him a sliver of light grew and grew.  
Then he reached out and that stone plug, at last,  
Flopped out of the hole and into the grass.

""My, my,"" he said, as he looked all around,  
""I suppose I'm the First Spoochy that ever was found!  
This meadow looks lovely, the floop plants abound!  
And a lake for my tooty kazoo canoe rounds!"" 

He decided to settle here in this land,  
And though he was lonely, he had a plan.  
He remembered a girl Spoochy down in a hole,  
He'd go and get her and make her his own. 

And life would be pleasant, and they'd have a brood,  
They'd live on floop pudding in Spoochy canoes.  
The whole world before them, they'd have their way,  
Nothing would hurt them...for ten thousand more days.",2016-11-01 21:39:56+00:00,d9hftt1,1.0,t3_5afv9e,79277.0,WritingPrompts

THE COMPLETED WORK

Long long ago, but not too far away,  
Was the land where the Spoochies frolicked and played.  
They danced through the fields, through the meadows they'd run,  
Near the stone on the hole the first Spoochy came from.

It was so long ago that no one remembered,  
The story of how came to be their first member.  
But no Spoochy cared, or gave it a thought,  
For Spoochies were hardly a curious lot.

So, when the stone on the hole gave a shudder,  
Not even one Spoochy made even a mutter.  
None of them knew what this motion portended; 
The Ten-Thousandth Day had finally ended.

Now all the sweet Spoochies were asleep for the night,  
All huddled and snuggled and bundled just right.  
Dreaming the dreams that all Spoochies do,  
Of eating floop pudding in their Spoochy canoes. 

But little Spoochina, the youngest of all,  
Awoke with a start to a noise down the hall. 
She shivered and shuddered, then slipped out of bed,  
And crept to the door with a feeling of dread. 

But with each step she took a malevolence grew,  
Erasing her thoughts of those Spoochie canoes.  
The darkness expanded and swallowed her whole,  
It crushed all her bones and tore at her soul. 

It flooded her mouth, and wrapped round her spine,  
Split open her skull and entered her mind.  
Oh! The horrors the darkness let in!  
An endless progression of madness and sin! 

She wriggled and twisted and screamed through the pain,  
But the darkness pushed deeper till nothing remained.  
For an infinite time, or perhaps just a moment,  
What once was Spoochina succumbed to this torment.

And then, in an instant, as quick as it came,  
The darkness relented and *something* remained.  
The *something* knew nothing of Spoochie canoes,  
Of snuggles and cuddles or tooty kazoos.  

Black pits for eyes, mouth like a slit,  
Dreams of floop pudding meant nothing to it.  
Nightmares are from what this creature was made,  
Murder and madness and torture it's trade. 

Joints cracked backwards the creature did rise,  
Extended its hands, fingers like knives.  
And leapt towards the bedroom with staggering speed,  
Where Brother and Sister were still fast asleep. 

It burst through the door and onto the bed,  
Snatched up dear Brother and bit through his head.  
Onto Sister fell what remained of his jaw,  
The rest of his flesh hung from *something's* black maw. 

Sister awoke to this startling sight,  
""My god, *Spoochina?!*"" she bellowed in fright.  
Through dear Brother's flesh the thing tried to speak,  
But all that came out was an inhuman shriek.

Heat blasted forth from its mouth into space,  
And melted the skin off of sweet Sister's face.  
Her liquified body sloughed onto her brother,  
As the thing left the room to find Father and Mother.

The floorboards buckled and cracked underfoot,  
Behind flowed a streak of crimson and soot.  
It licked at the smell of the sweat and the fear,  
And followed the sound of the whispers and tears.

There, huddled before it, clutching each other,  
Were the cowering forms of Father and Mother.  
Foam-flecked and wild they whimpered and stuttered,  
Pleading for mercy they wailed and they blubbered. 

They offered it all the floof pudding it craved,  
They cried out to their gods, St. Spoochbert and Dave.  
They hoped someone heard them but no*body* could,  
Just a hole in the world where their daughter once stood. 

The dark drew them in, their eyes were transfixed,  
As it peeled back its skin and opened its lips.  
Revealing the evils too deep to behold,  
From the dawn of time to the end of the world.

No Spoochy's mind could outlast that strain,  
They fried and they snapped and they both went insane.  
Clawing and biting with unholy power,  
Pop turned to Ma and began to devour. 

He plucked out her eyes and swallowed them whole,  
He gorged on her feet and chewed off their soles.  
His mouth filled with meat till he couldn't hold more,  
Then he coughed and he choked and he died on the floor.

The carnage complete, the house sat in silence,  
A hellish expanse transformed by the violence.  
The thing glided forth, slick on the ground,  
Down the dirt road and into the town. 

It poisoned the meadows, and blighted the fields,  
It burned up the lake where the floop canoes wheeled.  
It gobbled the children, and all the Old 'Nans,  
Till not one single Spoochy was left in the land.

When it was over, the thing returned home,  
To the edge of the wood, to the hole with the stone.  
It rolled back the boulder, peered into the black,  
And slunk down the hole, to never look back.

Deeper and deeper, down the pit oh so vile,  
It sank to the bottom and spat out the child.  
Blinded by agony, she writhed in the dirt,  
The last of the Spoochies, just madness and hurt.

No one can say for how long she lie,   
At the bottom of the earth, or how she survived.  
But through some cruel twist of fate she lived,  
And then up from the depths of her gut sprang *him.* 

Perfectly pink, fat as a lamb,  
Happy and bouncy and ready to jam.  
A wee baby Spoochy, a picture of health,  
Had somehow emerged from inside herself.

She reeled back in shock and clutched at her chest,   
To see such a pure thing to her was grotesque.  
Her mind warped by all of the torment she'd seen,  
She flung him away with a jerk and a scream.

Up, up, through the earth he flew,  
Above him a sliver of light grew and grew.  
And then he reached that stone plug at last,  
Flopped out of the hole and into the grass.

""My, my,"" he said, as he looked around,  
""I suppose I'm the First Spoochy that ever was found!  
This meadow looks lovely, the floop plants abound!  
And a lake for my tooty kazoo canoe rounds!"" 

He decided to settle here in this land,  
And though he was lonely, he had a plan.  
He remembered a girl Spoochy down in a hole,  
He'd go and get her and make her his own. 

And life would be pleasant, and they'd have a brood,  
They'd live on floop pudding in Spoochy canoes.  
The whole world before them, they'd have their way,  
Nothing would hurt them...for ten thousand more days.

Edit 10: I'm editing up here now! I can't add links cuz I'm out of space! I'll figure it out.

Edit: Wow, first gold. Glad everyone enjoyed it! I'll try to finish/expand the story a bit today, I understand the ending is a bit abrupt and the characterization of the thing is underdeveloped. 

Edit 2: To those brave souls that want to illustrate this; absolutely! If anyone actually does this, I will definitely, um, flesh it out into a full on children's nightmare book.

Edit 3: yes, shriek is better. There are a few word choice changes I'll make, I'm gonna leave the original alone though.

Edit 4: wow, more gold? Le'tip le'doot le'tcetera! I have done a few more stanzas in the front as a setup, working on tying it all together now. Goal is still before Halloween ends, but I'm PST so some east coasters and beyond might get cheated.

Edit 5: I finished it. Apologies for the formatting, I'll fix it later. Hope it's everything you all imagined.

Edit 6: Fixed formatting and moved the complete work to the top of the post. 

Edit 7,8: Obligitory frothing gold comment! I'm not going to do it this instant, but I plan to link everyone's contributions here so everyone can see and listen to all the cool stuff you're all making. Apologies if any *spoooooooky* ghost edits mess up your recordings, I'm still trying to, ah, diversify the word stock.

Edit 9:If anyone knows any publishers that release this kind of thing, let me know. Hard to find a children's book publisher that would deal with this content!

But the darkness pushed further till nothing remained.  
For an infinite time, or perhaps just a moment,  
What once was Spoochina succumbed to this torment.

And then, in an instant, as quick as it came,  
The darkness relented and *something* remained.  
The *something* knew nothing of Spoochie canoes,  
Of snuggles and cuddles or tooty kazoos.  

Black pits for eyes, mouth like a slit,  
Dreams of floop pudding meant nothing to it.  
Nightmares are from what this creature was made.  
Murder and madness and torture its trade. 

Joints cracked backwards the creature did rise,  
Extended its hands, fingers like knives,  
And leapt towards the bedroom with staggering speed,  
Where brother and sister were still fast asleep. 

It burst through the door and onto the bed,  
Snatched up dear brother and bit through his head.  
Onto Sister fell what remained of his jaw,  
The rest of his flesh hung from *something's* black maw. 

Sister awoke to this startling sight,  
""My god, *Spoochina?!*"" she bellowed in fright.  
Through dear Brother's flesh the thing tried to speak,  
But all that came out was an inhuman screech.

Heat blasted forth from its mouth into space,  
And melted the skin off of sweet Sister's face.  
Her liquified body sloughed onto her brother,  
As the thing left the room to find Father and Mother.

135,"M pekka won't kill both a sparky and wiz before dying if the giant in front is soaking tower. It takes 1 second for a deploy time, 1.8 seconds per swing, plus a little time to walk a few steps and get ready for the first swing. So, if you zap and drop perfectly, it takes 4.6 seconds to kill a sparky with a m pekka, and sparky charges in 5 seconds. That's less than half a second of error or that m pekka you drop is just 4 lix of vaporized m pekka. If your opponent is running ice wiz, you can double that attack time. Zap is also enough of a delay at .5 seconds to put total perfect deploy time at 5.1 seconds, or .1 seconds too late to do anything but die.

I think the reason there is such a split opinion on this card is deck composition. If you already  rock one or more of the 4 sparky counters in your normal play style, you're like ""what's the big deal, sparky is so easy to kill."" If you don't, sparky rules your face.

Imagine you have a running contest. Let's see who can run the fastest, yay! Ok so a ton of people show up and start racing each other, and we start grouping people based on time. This guy runs 100m in 20 seconds, he's in group 1, this guy runs it in 16, group 2, etc.

So, some of these runners have bare feet, and it's harder for them to run. Some of them (probably from Kenya or whatever) are still crazy fast at running and get good times, but mostly, people with fancy running shoes have a huge advantage and get way better times. So, up in group 9 we have a few guys that can run a sub 10 second 100m. A couple of the barefoot Kenyans in group 8 are like, ""man, it sucks we have bare feet, it's not fun to run against all these guys who won because they have nice shoes."" So they get the idea that it would be more fair if they only had to race other people with no shoes on. So they start racing each other, and they get awarded points and move up the ladder and now they're in arena 9, but *they shouldn't be there*, because they can't run a sub 10 100m with their bare feet.

I'm just always looking for a way to counter the meta...if everyone plays conservative and expects the same, I come fast, throw them off balance. That goes in line with your other advice, which is sound. Always be flexible.

So I guess for my specific strat, I open fast. If I hit with that open, then I don't really have to worry about whether or not they know when I'm gonna place my miner because the game is already over, they have 800hp left on one tower, I'm untouched, and have the ability to play very defensively and chip at that 800 for 2:50. I almost never lose a match when I do a big hit on the first push, *except in instances where my opponent does exactly the same thing and fast pushes the other lane at match start.*

The other advantage is that, if your opponent successfully counters your first push, then they believe they have you beat and save that combo for your next attempt, which you can just not use. This idea is the basis for something like a zap bait deck, where you trick your opponent into thinking you're being predictable, waste their counter on your ""predictable push"" and then get wasted when you switch it up on them.

169,"Nope. The reason sparky is ""op"" is that, with deploy time, once the sparky starts charging and wrecking it's almost impossible to stop. The reason that sparky is ""laughable"" is that it's incredibly easy to drop a nothing troop to trigger its charge and then waste it.

Making it only target towers solves both problems. Sparky opponents don't get stuck in the death cycle, and sparky users don't have to lament that pretty much every single low cost troop is a hard counter to sparky.

Edit: since you ghost edited, if you don't run any defensive structures, that's your choice, and you get to deal with the consequences (advantages and disadvantages) of that decision.

171,"Cheers, lots of other good advice here!

&gt;For the second part, I actually have to disagree with that. Even if it does pay off, unless it takes the tower the losses are more than 6 elixir. The main reason these decks lose is there predictability.

Then don't play predictably. I'll be the first one to tell you I hate rinse and repeat strategy decks with no variation. Just because you open with a particular combo doesn't mean you have to use it in rotation every time. If I see they know how to counter my miner/goblin, I don't use that combo anymore, I'll do miner/mini-pekka/fire spirits instead.

&gt;Sure, there versatile, but people don't realize that they can easily tell when a miner will be placed. This allows them to get there spells ready and all other defence.  

How can they get their spells ready when the match started 1 second ago, they have only 6 lix, and the miner is already on their tower? My whole point was that if they have a bad deal, they CAN'T get their cards ready until it's too late. That's the whole point of doing it.

&gt;However if you save it, then you can mount up an even bigger push, and have confirmation if they can counter it, and for the disadvantage of a slightly worse hand, which would still be bad, but the way if they didn't know you had miner would still be bad, it can pay off even bigger with less risk. 

It's hard to wrap my head around this sentence, but I'll try. Your argument seems to be based on the idea that having a ""secret"" card that you save for a mid battle surprise is somehow more of an advantage than having to hold that card and play with 3 cards for the first 1:30 of the match is a disadvantage. I disagree. For very specific decks like Golem, hiding his existence can be beneficial, but the 3 card hinderance is huge.

Not to be a dick, but you open your post admonishing people that say they're amazing and then post obvious advice, and then you follow that up with ""play conservatively"", which has been the default advise and strategy in pretty much every write up. It doesn't get more obvious than ""see what your opponent has before pushing.""

That being said, an aggressive start is a risk/reward strategy that can pay off. What many people overlook is that the *first* play of the game is the only time your opponent doesn't have a choice of what cards they have in hand or knowledge of what is coming up. If I have miner/goblins to start and my opponent has no counters in their starting hand, I usually get either half a tower or the whole thing for 5 lix. That's a GG every single time. I find it happens about 20% of the time, so a 1/5 chance of completely dominating to start is worth it. If I fail, so what? I only used 5 lix, my opponent was forced to counter, and now if they want to push they don't have a full 10 lix to do so.

177,"Ice Wiz was my first, and for a long time only, legendary. I got him when I was floundering between 2100-2350 cups, just barely dipping in and out of A8. Within a week or so, I pushed up to 2800ish and stayed there until I got my Miner, which pushed me up to around 2950. I still haven't broken legendary, but I'm severely under leveled compared to most I face in this range(9/7/3 vs usually 10-11/8/4), with tons of legendaries.

Anyway, to the ice wiz. He works with pretty much every deck, his slow is amazing, and his slow coupled with his decent HP actually make him able to kinda tank in certain situations/mini-pushes.) His splash is serviceable but weak, zap is his friend for cards like minions and barbs.

The deck I used to get from 2200 to 2800, with the levels I had at the time:

Ice Wiz(1), Giant(6), Valk(6), Musketeer(7), Mini-Pekka(6), Cannon(8), Zap(9), Fireball(7). Elixir cost a manageable 3.4.

I'm sure this has been written up better, but here's the deck theory/strategy behind this deck:

This deck is not about a *strategy* that you rinse and repeat, like a hog cycle, it's a *tactical* deck that you use to make good trades and push when you can with what you've got. Incredibly versatile and weak to few decks. An interesting feature of this deck is it contains no swarm cards. All troop cards are single unit. This effectively cripples any splash damage card your opponent has, since splash is balanced with the idea that it will hit multiple targets. Another interesting feature: no epics! Easier to level the cards. 

Card Roles and tactical uses:

Ice Wizard: We'll start with him because that's what you asked about, and as the only legendary he's the star of this deck! Ice wiz is best played defensively, and then used in a push. He's NOT strong enough to take out things on his own though, so don't drop him alone in response to things like minion horde or hog unless you want to have a bad time. This is why zap is essential, which we'll get to. Ideally he's dropped in the back behind a tower to defend a push, then used in a counter push with Giant or Valk as the tank and Mini Pekka as the damage. Ice wiz slows the opponent down, which gives you a chance to catch up if you're behind in elixir and make plays to turn the game. It's never a bad idea to add the ice wiz to a defense or push, so I use him proactively and aggressively when I have him. Imagine your giant is crossing the line and opponent drops minion horde. Fireball takes too long to reach them before damage is done, and zap alone won't do the trick unless it's over leveled. If your ice wiz is already down, that zap will allow him to one shot the horde, saving most of your tank's HP. He can also serve as a last minute tank in a dire situation. Say your pekka just killed a tank in the back, she's now starting her run to the opponent tower. Your hand is zap, cannon, fireball, and ice wiz, with giant on deck. You have exactly 3 lix, and now the pekka is almost to the line! Your opponent has 800 hp left on his tower with 20 seconds to go. What do you do? You drop that ice wiz with confidence right in front of your mini-pekka is what you do. Cheap goblins and distractions get nuked and slowed by the wiz, pekka charges in to the tower and gets the one hit, ice wiz does another 90 hp chip before finally going down, and you finish with fireball with 8 seconds to go, then drop a cannon directly in front of your lowest hp tower and send the GG. 

Giant: Tank. Use to soak damage while other troops deal damage. Ideally placed in the back to start a push, but can be used defensively to stop a major tilt, or to split support from another incoming tank, or take a giant skeleton on a walk. Don't drop at the line unless you have a lot of troops down from a successful defense and you want to counter push, and make sure to prepare for minion horde, barb, etc counter.

Valk: Secondary tank, splash damage, and most importantly, the ""interrupt"" card. The main reason Valk is here is to intercept support at the line. Giant heading your way, backed by a witch and a musketeer? Wait for the giant to cross, and drop Valk on the line just as the support reaches the bridge. Drop a mini-pekka or musketeer on the giant. Bye bye push. She's also great directly in front of mini-pekka for a fast ground push, pekka will push Valk in front, with Valk taking out distraction troops (just like a hog Valk push). Use this when your opponent doesn't have air troops in his hand. Basically, if you have a potential counter push, like a full health musketeer that just iced a tank, drop Valk in front for a quick counter push your opponent can't ignore.

Musketeer: Dps for tanks, and important flying troop counter. Musketeer is support only, used to defend behind towers, stop air pushes, put good damage on anything else. Try to use as a counter to get value, not just in a pure push. Never drop in front of a tower or tank, she'll get eaten by pretty much anything if left undefended. Note: She pretty much has to be lvl7, otherwise fireball can one shot her, which is bad news.

Mini-pekka: Win condition, tank counter. Never play alone unless you know your opponent has zero lix and you have zap ready. Deadly when behind a giant with an ice wiz/Valk for splash and musketeer for support dps. If you have zap, you can get a shot on a tower if your opponent counters with minion horde or goblins. Tombstone is bad news. Your general goal throughout the match is to get the pekka to the tower, through whatever means necessary. 

Cannon: Purely there for the massive amount of hogs you see, and to pull tower targeting units. I've tried to rock other defense structures with this deck(inferno tower almost works) but nothing beats the trade for the cannon. At 3 lix, you can pretty much always drop it when you need to, and it is a hard counter to hog+weak support like spear gobs or fire spirits. There are just soooo many hog users, it's hard to let go of a card that gives you a minimum +1 lix trade in 80% of your matches. Usually a hog user will open with hog/spirits, I drop cannon, and bam, I've got a +3 lix advantage in the first 10 seconds. If using cannon to pull a troop like golem/lava hound, drop it as late as possible so your opponent doesn't have a chance to neutralize the cannon before it has a chance to do its job.

Fireball: Splash damage/control/last second clutch wins/direct tower damage. I find that the matches I lose are the matches I don't use fireball actively. Fireball is your safety blanket, your emergency panic button to handle that minion swarm eating your tower, or to nuke that incoming pekka/barb push, or to get that delicious 4 for 9 trade with 3 musketeers. It saves you when you have 5 seconds left and 190 damage to go on an enemy tower. I can't count the wins I've pulled due to fireball. Fireball is ideally used on an opponent tower while they have support cards at the tower. This occurs at the start of their push or the end of yours. If they drop a witch in the back to start I almost ALWAYS fireball her. Bonus points if they stupidly dropped a musketeer as well. Fireball is a match winner, if you go into overtime, treat it like a rocket and cycle that fireball on the tower, you can do 800 damage in under a minute if you cycle it with defense like wiz, cannon, Valk during overtime. Just insanely useful.

Zap: Zap is your friend, and the uses are too many to name. In this deck, you use it to kill minion horde with ice wiz, or finish off support you just fire balled, to kill incoming goblins, barrel or otherwise, or to reset a sparky/inferno whatever. If you push a solo mini-pekka and your opponent drops minion horde at the tower to defend, you can zap just as the pekka passes underneath and the minion attack animation begins, the pekka will survive to get one hit on the tower, which is crucial. 

Closing thoughts:

I didn't think it would get this long, but there ya go. An unsolicited ice wiz deck for ya. I would say for the most part, the card levels above are the absolute minimum you need. Giant, Valk, Mini-Pekka, and Cannon all serve their purpose under leveled, but the others have key thresholds they need to cross. Musketeer can get one shot by a fireball one level above, so if you're rolling a level 6 musketeer, you will just die to fireball all day. Zap won't kill goblins one level above, so you will get rocked by fast damage cycle decks without a level 9 zap. Fireball 7 is essential for the same reason Musk 7 is; you will face mostly lvl 7 wiz and musketeer, and you need a lvl 7 to kill them with a zap combo. You'll also nuke any lvl 6 support, which will give you easy wins on the front half of the climb at 2200-2500 cups. 

Possible subs: you can sub inferno tower for cannon if you have tank troubles, but then I usually sub fire spirits for fireball to balance lix cost. Arrows can sub for the two spells if you want to add a lix collector or secondary win condition, but you lose the ability to nuke support and barbs, and to reset sparky/inferno. Maybe sub in an ice spirit also, which can reset those things if you roll arrows. Prince can maybe sub for pekka, but I don't love it.

Thins to look out for. This deck is weak to big hitter decks, since there are no swarm cards at all. A prince push can be daunting with nothing like spear gobs/skeletons to drop in front, which is why I feel the cannon is so essential as a low cost distraction to stop these kind of things. Also a little weak to sparky for the same reason, you definitely have to focus on killing the sparky at the line if you want to win. Pretty much zap/mini-pekka, with a pre-fireball if there is support like wiz behind.

I'm not going to get into specific deck strats like how to counter trifecta or lava hound without prompting, but if anyone at all finds this comment interesting and wants to know more, I'm happy to expand.

243,"&gt;I do care about whether the two moral positions (pro-life or pro-choice) were achieved through differing levels of rationality.

Ok, then. Just say that in the future...4 or 5 posts of blargity blarg and all you had to say is ""Are the pro-life and pro-choice positions equally rational?"" To which I would reply, ""obviously not.""

The pro-choice position is practical and beneficial to society, and to the individual who has the abortion. Unwanted children are a financial and emotional burden to their parents. We already have a population problem. This issue also disproportionally affects poorer people. If you put a blanket ban out on abortion tomorrow, rich people would still be able to afford illegal abortions that are relatively safe. Poor people would not, and would be forced into having dangerous back alley abortions if they didn't want to keep the child (this currently happens in states like Mississippi). Poor people also can't afford the extra burden another child brings. You can't just say ""well don't have sex then"", because that has NEVER worked. That's not how humans are. It is rational to allow a woman to control what happens to things inside her body, it is rational to break cycles of poverty and not force poor families into having children they don't want.

Now, to talk about pro-life, I'm going to have to put some words in your mouth, or at least make some generalizations about why and how people arrive at a pro-life position, since in however many posts you've made in this conversation, you've carefully avoided stating an actual stance you have, a vexatious rhetorical technique. (You can't refute my position if I don't have one, ha!)

The pro-life position is based on *faith*, the direct antithesis of reason. You have to accept that morality is dictated by a collection of writings made by cave men and retranslated and interpreted by many different people, like the worlds longest game of telephone. If you have an argument for pro-life that doesn't ultimately boil down to faith in some way, by all means present it and we can discuss its rationality. If you don't, all I can do is say that the arguments I've heard supporting pro-life all inevitably fall to something like ""God has a plan for every living thing, he guides the process of life, which is sacred, and unborn babies have souls, which makes them as important as adults."" That's not rational at all. If you decide you want to believe in a Christian God and follow the rules that religion has laid out, by all means. Not everyone believes in the sky fairy, though.

For you to prove that a faith based pro-life position is rational, you'd have to prove that faith in the bible and Christianity is rational. Good luck.",2016-09-21 19:47:18+00:00,d7wgtbq,,t1_d7w9cz8,8909.0,changemyview

What is and is not alive (to us) is a purely human definition. We decided that it's semantically useful to say that a tree and a cat are alive, and a rock is not. We've also decided that although a tree is alive, it isn't alive the same way a cat is, and a cat isn't alive the same way a person is. Unless you're a militant vegan, you'd agree that it's ok to eat cows, but everyone agrees it's not ok to eat baboons...so obviously we can infer that there is a hierarchy to life, and although we don't sanction wantonly slaughtering cows for fun, we certainly are ok with eating them for food. 

We draw the line somewhere, we have to. Even people who oppose abortion have to draw an arbitrary line somewhere. Is a sperm alive?

As to an argument from evidence, I'm not sure what you mean. It is evident that a fully formed human adult possesses qualities that a fetus does not have. It isn't tautologically impossible to prove that a fetus does have these qualities, we just don't have the technology.

So, the decision becomes a pragmatic one. Absent enough evidence for or against, we have to look at society as a whole and say, what is the most benefit.

A carbon tax is just another cost. If making the fuel cost $1, and the carbon tax is $1, then it functionally cost $2 to make.

But this only works if the same tax is applied to all my competition (because they all pollute and pay the tax) because then the prices would go up across the board. If one major competitor had a way to make the product and not incur the carbon tax, then he'd have an advantage. No one has figured out how to do this yet, and since they all pollute, then there is no incentive to change. 

This isn't a problem with an incentive. There is no added *cost* to pass to a consumer, only an added *reward*, that can be kept by the company or passed to the consumer in the form of a price reduction, which increases market share.

&gt;In any fundamental issue that deals with human rights, you have to be very clear and concrete. You can't use ambiguous and vague terms. 

And yet here we are. We cannot be clear and concrete, because we lack data. All we can do is draw arbitrary lines. Is a sperm alive? Biblical morality forbids masturbation, because, as Monty Python sang, ""every sperm is sacred."" And yet you'd be hard pressed to find any but the most strict of Christians put a blanket ban on all masturbation of any kind. Do you believe every sperm is as much alive as a fetus? If not, what would you say to someone who did? How would their view look to you?

Maybe you belive life begins at conception, but that's an arbitrary line. Maybe someone else says 1st trimester. I think we can all agree that if you make it out of the vagina, you are definitely a person with rights. I'd say 99% or more would agree that a fetus that's 5 minutes from being born would also qualify...I'd say that extends down through the 3rd trimester for sure. But then things get murky. Somewhere between sperm and developed fetus, we have to draw a line.

272,"I picked children because they are humans that are capable of rational thought, have basic rights, and yet cannot vote.

But sure, workers, jobs. Whether or not it is in their best long term interest or not, people just don't vote that way. It is in our long term interest to foster a healthy education system, and yet people vote directly opposite that. It is in our long term interest to protect the environment, and people directly oppose that. 

&gt;Your first instinctive thought is probably, ""they'll just vote for whoever makes their job easier"" problem is if work doesn't get done, the business will fail, and they will be out of a job. It's in their best interest to pick someone  that benefits them in the long run, and at the same time make work bearable.

273,"I mean you cannot *successfully* legislate against sex. Rape laws exist, sure. That doesn't mean rapes don't occur. You brought up abstinence as a solution, I pointed out that you will never successfully stop people from having sex. I don't see how you could argue otherwise.

I mean alive as the blanket term for what we think of as a viable human life. A sperm is not alive. A 6 year old is. A fetus...well, no one really knows. That's the whole point, we don't know.

Slavery is apples to oranges. It is clear that there are more similarities between a black slave and a white slave owner than a fully formed human and a fetus. Also, you're comparing different time periods. It's easy to look with our 21st century sensibilities and say, ""obviously slavery is wrong."" That may not have been so obvious in 1600. The Bible actively condones slavery, so obviously moral sensibilities change. 

&gt;But it is clear at the moment, that the slave owner is a white person, thus without the use of his black labor force, his real rights and interests are being damaged. Until you can conclusively prove the moral value of black people, he should be able to use slaves as he sees fit. 

You are pretty much describing what actually happened with slavery. Slave owners said, ""slaves aren't people, we will be economically damaged if we lose them"" and everyone else said, ""well, it's pretty clear from our observations that these ""non-people"" seem to walk and talk and think and learn and love and do many other people things, so it's probably a good bet that they are in fact people so how about no more slavery?""

So, as I said originally, if that watershed moment were to occur and we shoved an electrode into a fetus brain that can detect thoughts and we found out, hey, looks like this thing is definitely an entity with hopes and dreams and emotions and consciousness, then I'd be right there with ya. No more fetus killing. But that hasn't happened, and I personally don't believe that it's likely to happen. So, given the choice between benefitting a thing that I definitely know is a person by harming a thing that might not be a person and definitely harming a person by benefiting a thing that only maybe is a person, I'll take helping the definitely a person person every time.

You are examining this issue while completely ignoring the negative effects that an unwanted pregnancy brings to a woman. We have a *possible* situation where a fetus might be a viable human vs a *definite* outcome of financial and emotional hardship for both mother and child of an unwanted pregnancy. If you could create a system that ensured no emotional or financial hardship to the mother while ensuring life for the fetus, you might have something. This is certainly not the case in practice, so I would argue that, absent any new evidence, it is morally correct to value the wellbeing of a person who is *definitely* alive over the wellbeing of a person that only *might* be alive.

276,"Well, I mean, I think he was asking because if you had fully read and understood the article, you wouldn't have to ask what it has to say about taxation = extortion. It's fundamentally the same as the statement taxation = theft in this context. Your labeling of the noncentral fallacy as a thought terminating cliche further reinforces the idea that you misunderstand, or at least reject, the explanation provided in the link.
Comparing similar things is useful. Comparing apples to oranges is less so. This is specifically what the noncentral fallacy addresses. 

The fallacy arises by trying to assign the connotations of an archetypal example of x to a situation that is non-archetypal of x.

In this specific case, the archetypal example of extortion would be an entity with no interest in your well being or benefit that compels you to give up something against your will in exchange for protection from harm by some external entity, when in fact it is the compelling entity itself which is the threat. Central to this idea is that the compelling entity is acting in bad faith by claiming it has the best interest of the extorted party at heart, when it clearly does not.

The only part of this that holds up when applied to taxation is ""against your will."" So yes, taxation is perhaps *technically* extortion, but it is not anywhere near the archetypal example of it. To make the statement ""taxation = extortion"" is encouraging the listener to make a connection between taxation and the central aspects of extortion, when no connection exists. It is a fundamentally dishonest rhetorical tactic designed to terminate cognition and make an association between two things that are not associated.",2016-09-16 10:26:47+00:00,d7p1qt7,7.0,t1_d7oeeua,46094.0,changemyview

It's a fundamental human error in judgement to perceive things that are ""theirs"" as more valuable, so most managers will have irrational attachment values to the players they currently have. A few weeks of actual performance metrics should change that.

I've found that if I take an RB first round, my second round WR options are the likes of Jordy, Demaryius, Brandin Cooks, none of whom I'm super high on.

&gt;Obviously, there are special cases but the point still stands that you can't tell people it's wrong/right to feel something (don't twist this into saying something like, ""well, pedophiles who like children must not be wrong because it's what they feel, right?"")

Why not twist it to mean that? Because it doesn't fit your incredibly shallow argument? Pedopholes that like children DO feel ""wrong"" feelings. You can't exclude that case just because it goes against your ""nothing is right or wrong"" argument. Above, you tried the same bullshit with social contract, arguing that because it was originally theorized to keep us from raping and murdering each other, that it somehow couldn't also keep us from cutting in line.

&gt;but the point still stands that you can't tell people it's wrong/right to feel something

This seems to be your premise (although you keep trying to use it as an argument). So, according to YOUR PREMISE:

It isn't wrong to feel that all non-whites are revolting and should be brutally raped and murdered.

It isn't wrong for me to feel entitled, because I'm obviously the smartest person on the planet, to steal whatever I want from whoever I want. 

It isn't wrong for me feel happy every time I see a video of a child refugee being killed.

It isn't wrong for me to feel sad that Hitler only killed some of the Jews.

You can't have your argument both ways. Either there is no right and wrong and every feeling is equally 'valid', or there is right and wrong and some feelings are considered right and beneficial, and some are considered wrong and harmful.

391,"Um, no? From armsbearingcitizen.com:

&gt;One of the biggest things that the AR-15 has going for it is its ease of use and accuracy. It is a powerful gun but this does nothing to take away from its handling. It is a gun that almost anyone can learn to use and use well. Increased firepower is nothing if you don’t know how to use it.

Powerful gun, eh? Well, not quite like the .22 I used to shoot on grandpa's farm when I was 11, but ok.

&gt;Furthermore, the AR-15 is more than powerful enough to get the job done. Instead of standard cartridges, it is best to use metal-jacketed, lead alloy core bullets with a 10 grain hardened steel penetrator tip inside. Though more expensive, these bullets are far heavier duty and greatly improve the AR-15’s ability to puncture hard targets such as a steel helmet.

Of course, *metal-jacketed, lead alloy core bullets with a 10 grain hardened steel penetrator tip inside*, just the ammo I need to hunt rabbits and shoot tin cans and do other non-assaulty things.

&gt;The AR 15 wins here as the caliber itself has a much higher velocity than the 22 LR. It’s used by most law enforcement agencies and the military for a reason. Most people just starting out don’t realize that the bullet size of an AR-15 (.223 or .556 caliber) is actually about the same size as a 22 LR bullet. It has a lot more powder in the shell and packs a much bigger punch than the 22 LR.

Yeah, totally the same thing as my childhood .22... /s

You can label anything as anything, but the way words generally work, if you want to communicate something, you have to use words in ways that people agree upon and find meaningful. Sci-fi is a broad genre, to be sure. You don't need aliens or a ""future"" setting. Star Wars is set 'long, long ago'.

I'm sure you've heard the quote ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."" I think that, more than any other, this is the element at the core of sci-fi. Whether it be soft sci-fi, like Clarke, or hard sci-fi, like Stephenson, there is an element of the magical, the fantastic. There are processes and technology that just can't be explained. 

I'm reading Seveneves by Stephenson right now. It's set in space. The moon explodes. But I still wouldn't call it quite 'sci-fi', it's speculative fiction. Take one conceit (hey, the moon blew up) and then explore the consequences.

Let's take a population of 100. Of this population, 90 are white and 10 are black.

Of the white population, 30 are considered 'in poverty' and 60 are not. Of the black population, 8 are considered in poverty and 2 are not.

Now, let's give all the people considered 'in poverty' free college tuition! Yay!

So, by the u/IAmAN00bie definition , you have 30 white people getting free college, and only 8 black people getting free college. 30 is certainly more than 8, so by pure numbers, there is a disproportionate number of whites receiving free tuition.

However, if you look at it as a percentage, like u/TraderTed, then only 33% of whites receive free tuition, but 80% of blacks do. 80% is certainly more than 33%, so there is a disproportionate number of blacks receiving free tuition.

Now, which way is right? I tend to agree with the 2nd definition, I think that percentage of population is more important than raw numbers. Why? Well, there are some ethnicities that have low populations, and if we only considered raw numbers, then even if 100% of that population received free tuition, it would be 'disproportionately less' than whites.

478,"As a rule of thumb, in California you cannot sign away any rights guaranteed to you by any other law or civil code. That is to say, existing law *supersedes* the lease. If you sign a lease that contains a clause that would violate a right, that clause is considered null, but the rest of the lease is still enforceable. 

As an extreme example, your landlord couldn't include a clause in your lease that said if you failed to pay rent, you would have to live as his slave for the rest of your life. Or more precisely, he could include the clause, and you could sign the lease, and then if he tried to enforce it, you would not be legally bound to comply. 

As a more practical example, California has strict laws regarding security deposits, and one rule is that security deposits MUST be returned within 21 days of the last date of occupancy. If the occupant hasn't provided a forwarding address, the landlord is required to mail the deposit refund to the last known address, even if that address is the unit in question. I had a landlord put a clause in the lease stating that it was the responsibility of the tenant to collect the security deposit if they did not provide a forwarding address. I had emailed a forwarding address to them, but they chose to adhere to the letter of the law, which requires any change of address communication between landlord and tenant to be done via certified mail. Long story short, 21 days passed and I contacted my former landlord requesting the full deposit amount, since after that period the deposit is required to be paid in full. They contended that, per the clause in the lease, because I had not used official channels to provide the address change, it was my responsibility to pick up the refund (with deductions) from their office. However, because there is a civil code that specifically outlines my rights as a tenant in regards to security deposits, those laws superseded the lease.

536,"&gt;You see, the thing is, making a new party is more than just talking about it. You have to get things like infrastructure built up, solid followers to rely on, candidates to lead you, all that. You also need funding.

Who is saying otherwise?

&gt;Especially considering that everyone on this sub who has been talking about forming a new party has just been debating the name. The name is just that, a name. No one has even spoken about getting involved locally

There are threads here discussing exactly that, getting involved locally. There are also threads discussing the name of a new party. Can we have threads talking about all these different topics, or can we only have threads about topics you approve of?

&gt;Not only that but a majority of people haven't even heard of the Green party, let alone know enough about it to have an opinion on it. 

Source? How do you know who knows and doesn't know about the Green Party? Personally, I've known about it since I was a kid. I would wager that if you asked the average joe on the street what the Green Party was, they'd say something along the lines of ""a bunch of hippies that want world peace, blah blah."" Which is exactly the problem I'm talking about.

&gt;And no, the Green Party isn't just environmentalism. Look at it's platform, listen to interviews with Jill Stein, talk to some of the followers of the party. You'll find that a lot of the time, they agree nearly on 100% of the issues that Sanders supporters fight for.

Whether or not that's true, that's not public perception. If they're about more than environmentalism, then the *Green Party* was a poor name choice. 

The only joke here is believing that you can overcome decades of branding by telling people to ""have a listen to Jill Stein."" If you want *this exact* movement to be anything more than a flash in the pan, then do everything you can to avoid saddling it with the baggage of the past.

538,"&gt;Many progressives would not identify as ""republican"", and yet that aversion effectively sabotages any discussion about our country as a ""republic"".

It is determined by *both*, it's not a dichotomy as you show it. Of course, if I make a party called the Rainbow Unicorn party, and then all the members of that party turn out to be murderers, the name Rainbow Unicorn might be associated with murderers in the future. However, if I make a party called the ""I hate fatties"" party, then the label/name will *definitely* determine the type of people that gather under it.

That, to me, is a stronger argument for a different name than ""The Progressive Party."" Not that people will distort what the word 'progressive' means in general, but that the word 'progressive' will limit who thinks they should join the party. If you want to pull from both parties, than the word progressive is probably too polarizing.",2016-06-10 21:24:46+00:00,d4460dw,4.0,t1_d44435y,2766.0,Political_Revolution

621,"Good stuff here, thank you.

&gt;This is an absolute position, imprisonment also prevents the suffering of future victims.

Imprisonment does also, but it can never equal or be greater than death. This point isn't really central to my argument though, so we can probably move past it.

&gt;Who said anything about rehabilitation? 

The commonly stated goal of the justice system is correction and rehabilitation. If the goal were something else, say purely punishment, then the case for a death penalty is even stronger.

&gt;If tomorrow 51% of people said ""We should be able to have sex with children"" would that make it right? 

Without getting too far into subjective morality, I would point out that a few hundred years ago, people did largely say it was ok to have sex with what we consider children. Are you saying that every 19 year old that married a 14 year old in the 1600s is retroactively a rapist? And although I may not agree with the 51% number, by and large some aspects of morality *are* dictated by society.

&gt;The fact that more people are happy doesn't make something right.

Depending on your school of thought, that may in fact be *the only* criteria by which to judge moral action.

&gt;You could argue rape and murder come from primal instincts, that doesn't make them moral.

It certainly doesn't. But rape and murder both violate the rights of others, and both rape and murder are negative primal traits. I contend that righteous vengeance is a positive trait, directly contrasted by unjustified petty vengeance. There are cases when anger is justified and cases when it isn't. I believe there are also cases when vengeance is justified, and cases when it isn't.

&gt;If you strangle someone in a ""crime of passion"" thats very different from planning someones murder for revenge. 

Some cultures have a concept of vendetta that would argue that there are cases when planning and executing a ""murder"" of this nature is justified. At one point America was one of those cultures. It isn't now, but that's just how we currently feel about it. That could change given time. Or not. The point is this isn't a foreign concept.

&gt;Your argument seems to rely on vengeance being moral. But you don't address that outside of saying because its a normal reaction it must be moral. They're are many ""normal"" or primal reactions which are not moral. 

I think I addressed this above, but to restate, just because a reaction is 'normal' doesn't make it justified. However, that doesn't negate the fact that there are cases when it is.

&gt;There's a big difference between you wanting to avenge your wife, and the state doing it.

The state is just a collection of individuals, and the underlying justification for both acts is the same. It's just a matter of scale.",2016-05-31 11:22:07+00:00,d3q924x,4.0,t1_d3q81vi,3209.0,changemyview
622,"I think that whether or not capital punishment lowers violent crime requires a certain amount of context depending on the situation. In a strict dictatorship, I'm sure that capital punishment for say, rape, would certainly lower the instance of rape. If you knew for certain that you would be immediately put to death if found guilty of rape, you would probably think harder before raping than if there wasn't that consequence. This may not hold true in all instances, say heavily disturbed compulsive rapist, but it would for rapes of opportunity.

Conversely, in a society where capital punishment is a long, expensive, convoluted process with lengthy appeals that can take decades before a sentence is carried out, I'd imagine it wouldn't be much of a deterrent at all.

Either way, I don't see how a death penalty could ever *increase* violent crime, unless you're specifically talking about violent crime directed at the institution enforcing the penalty. I don't think anyone has said ""I normally wouldn't rape and murder you, but since this is Texas and the death penalty exists, I'm gonna go ahead and do that.""",2016-05-31 10:47:44+00:00,d3q8e3e,6.0,t1_d3q86cw,717.0,changemyview

624,"Good questions, and a great point to consider.

We've established that the killer is guilty, we've accepted for now that killing the man *in flagrante* is justified, and we are accepting just for now that killing the man after trial is justified. So why isn't the guards' killing justified? 

I would contend that the justification for the former and the latter be the same, namely morally justified vengeance. In the first act, it is easy to see why killing this man would be justified. He is right in front of you, committing atrocities. In the last act, it's the same. He was right there, committing atrocities. You all know he was. That same righteous anger for vengeance is still there, and I still believe it is justified.

In the case of the guards, this condition is not met. This man is not currently causing harm, and the trial and subsequent execution are where this man will justifiably meet his end. *Who are these guards to take that mantle of indignant fury upon themselves and deprive that final justice to those who deserve it most?*

Or maybe it turns out some lawyer in the original trial ends up getting convicted of drug abuse and all their cases get reevaluated, and a guilty guy gets out on appeal. 

I could come up with more examples of you need them, but the point is that you can argue that there is hypothetically a way to prevent recidivism, but the only 100% way to ensure it is death. 99.99% of the time there may be no justification for that extreme, but 99.99 isn't 100.",2016-05-31 10:04:18+00:00,d3q7n5x,4.0,t1_d3q6u5w,3051.0,changemyview
628,"These are good insights, and I agree with parts of both of them.

1) Death would definitely prevent the suffering of any future victims. It would also protect against the future mental suffering of any person impacted by the crime that held the view that the death was justified. As an extreme example, many Americans would be angry if Osama Bin Laden had been captured and rehabilitated. Are the rights of thousands or millions to feel free of mental anguish less important than the rights of one avowed mass murderer to life?

2) Vengeance can be moral. The concept of vengeance is primal, there are certain actions that can't be tolerated. If someone violates your rights, you sue them. Possibly for financial gain, but you can't deny a feeling of righteousness when a wrong is righted. If someone rapes and murders your wife in front of your eyes, you are justified to grab them and strangle them to death. If someone rapes and murders your wife while you were out of town, you don't lose that justification. That anger and anguish is still as real. When a person does that kind of damage on a large scale, kills tens or hundreds or thousands of people, then those people deserve death.

The short version of that is that I believe that vengeance can be moral and justified fundamentally. That righteous desire for vengeance is an irreducible feeling much like desire, love, hate, fear. This is distinct from unjustified spiteful vengeance, someone wanting to get back at someone for an imagined sleight. ",2016-05-31 09:52:54+00:00,d3q7gmu,2.0,t1_d3q6y5u,1947.0,changemyview

665,"I think the biggest issue with iMDB is that people have different ideas about what they're actually rating. The litmus in your CMV is ""quality"" which some view as subjective. I tend to hold the view that cinema appreciation can be somewhat objective, in that there are clear stylistic choices, writing quality, aspects of cinematography and score that can be objectively considered better or worse than other examples in the same category.

Unfortunately, if you spend any time at all on the cesspool that is the iMDB message boards, you'll find that quite a few people do not vote that way. Many users vote on how the content of the movie made them feel, or based their vote on wether or not they like the main actor/actress. Good luck getting an objective score on the quality of an Amy Schumer movie on iMDB, people are rating *her*, not her movies.

As my quintessential example of subject bias vs actual movie quality, I present to you [The Man From Earth](http://m.imdb.com/title/tt0756683/). I encourage you to watch this movie, if you haven't already. It has an 8/10 currently, and at one point was on the ""Top 250"" list. This movie is objectively garbage. The writing, acting, directing, set design, score, all of it looks like it came from an afternoon special in the 80s. The reason this movie has such a high score is because of the premise it puts forward, to some it may be controversial, and to the demographic of people that vote on iMDB, that subject matter was something they approved of, so the movie got a lot of 10s. 

Watching that movie and realizing IMDb rates it as an 8 and not a 4 should be proof enough that ratings are not particularly indicative of overall quality.",2016-05-31 05:24:24+00:00,d3q2hcq,1.0,t3_4lrdxj,32957.0,changemyview

667,"While circles may be superior for scooping from a curved surface, you must also accept that *this only comes into play when the load has been sufficiently depleted as to require ""bowl scraping"".* If we allow that in general a bowl shape could be considered roughly equivalent to half a hollow sphere, then a simple surface area to volume ratio can be calculated. When we do this, we find that, for the large majority of the time, the load vessel is sufficiently full as to allow load scooping without having to scrape the sides. This seems like another case of using the least common case (scraping the side of the bowl) to justify the superiority of the circular chip while flatly ignoring the far more common case (the bowl is sufficiently full to allow no scrape dipping and therefore any advantages the circle yields for edge scraping are irrelevant.)

As an anecdotal example of load size, I actually just made chili two nights ago. I used triangular chips and I didn't have *a single* breakage. Perhaps your preference for circular chips is an artifact of inferior dipping technique when using triangle chips?

That aside, it seems like the only factor that really matters to you is breakage and edge scraping ability. Since we've just covered how edge scraping is a small minority of overall chip use, we then are left with breakage.

Something to the affect of: CMV that circle chips, that are bite sized, when presented with a particularly heavy load, consumed from a bowl, without any need for pre-melting cheese on individual chips in an oven, (insert all other arbitrary requirements here), are superior to triangle chips.

669,"&gt;So, either you eat a majority of chip undipped after the first bite

A rare occurrence. This only happens when the length of the shortest side of the triangle is longer than the distance between lip corners, forcing the less desirable one corner load.

&gt;or you double dip 

All of my supporting arguments of course assume no double dip unless consuming solo. Again, the single corner load is not the primary method for triangle chips, just a less optimal contingency.

&gt;This is assuming that the triangular chip doesn't fracture into unusable shards.

This only seems to be a problem under heavy load. Circular chips fracture less, but they still do fracture on occasion. There may be an argument for circular chips in these circumstances, but at least for me, this is not the norm.

&gt;You're telling me circles, which are easily able to be eaten in one mouthful are simply better.

If no other consideration other than structural integrity and absence of mouth corner abrasion is made, then one could argue that the most superior form of chip is a bite sized circle. HOWEVER, I believe that purely basing chip rating on these two factors alone is unwise. Simple aesthetics can still be considered, for example. I find bite size chips to be less appealing than larger chips. I also find, since bag breakage is inevitable for a portion of chips, that the resulting fragments of bite size circles are too small to effectively use, leading to product waste. We also are not considering chip material, if the composition of the chip is robust enough, the amount of load will never exceed the strength of the chip, and the fracturing becomes a non issue.

My assertion is this: While circle chips my be superior under specific circumstances, their benefits are only really an asset under those circumstances. The majority of circle chips encountered in the wild are not bite sized, while the majority of triangle chips are not so wide as to exceed mouth corner distance. Since this is the case, I would say that *a majority of the time* triangle chips are the superior choice, and that circle chips should only be selected when it is known that the material of chips available is inferior, or the load will be sufficiently heavy to require the extra structural support the circle chip affords.

677,"&gt;Either the contract allows the patron to sue the prostitute for breaking the contract, meaning she may have to refund her rapists instead of being compensated for damages

I'm confused by this. You're saying that the *rapist* would sue the *rapee* for damages, and the rapee would have to pay the rapist? When would this situation ever occur? I would imagine the opposite would be true, and we wouldn't be talking about suing someone in civil court, we'd be talking about criminal charges, because this is rape.

&gt;or the contract allows the prostitute to break the contract at any time with no recourse for the patron.

Why? Why is this an either or? Are you telling me you can't even imagine an agreement that would both outlaw rape *and* protect the customer from being ripped off by a prostitute? I already provided an example of when a client would be entitled to remuneration from the prostitute on the grounds of the service paid for not being rendered. Do you need more examples?

As to my statement as to the ambiguity of rape, it stems from the parent comment, the one you were awarded a delta for. You brought up the fact that it may be difficult to prosecute a person for raping a prostitute because of the contract involved, were it legal. This entire subsequent discussion has been me trying to show you why that proposition is preposterous, since we clearly have a system in place for prosecuting rape, and I don't see why prostitution would be a special case compared to literally any other industry.

&gt;Or, we simply don't worry about it. Without a contract, I'm entitled to nothing (neither sex or a refund) if my sex partner withdraws consent. Why should we bother complicating the matter with contracts?

Are you thinking we're talking about like a physical contract written on a piece of paper that is signed by both parties, and not the implied contract that exists whenever money is exchanged for a good or service? You recognize that, without signing a document, McDonalds and I have an implied contract of service when I give them money for a cheeseburger? This is the contract I'm talking about.

Other users have pointed this out for you, *prostitution doesn't require special circumstances to mitigate rape because rape is never on the table as a commodity or service to sell.* You can't buy rape, so I don't understand when this hypothetical situation you propose would ever come up.

Also, your proposed solution of just allowing the ""escort"" service and keeping prostitution technically illegal is a *terrible* solution. It provides absolutely no rights for the prostitutes, who could now be charged for a crime (prostitution) if they try to report a rape (you know, a real crime). And in effect, it's like a brown bag law. And if anything, it introduces even more gray area. I think a misunderstanding about whether or not the money paid for an 'escort' service (a *prostitute* wink wink) should cover sex would come up far more often than a misunderstanding about what is or is not rape while having legal sex with a prostitute.

I mean, by even bringing up and escort service as a solution, knowing full well that 'escort' is a direct euphemism for 'prostitute', it really seems like you're advocating for legal prostitution. Do you think escort services should be legal? Do you acknowledge that escort is synonymous with prostitute, to all intents and purposes? If so, congratulations, you support legalized prostitution!

This statement doesn't even make semantic sense. Are you saying the loss to a person who is raped is greater than the loss to a person labeled a rapist? Or are you saying the opposite?

Forget the analogy, since you are focusing on aspects not intended to be analogous. You brought up the fact that there could be a problem distinguishing the boundary between what would be considered just rough sex and what would be considered rape. I find that proposition absurd. There are clearly ways to differentiate what is rape and what isn't, and I don't understand while you are trying to make prostitution a special case. Take money out of the equation and it's just two people having sex, and the rules are clearly defined. Just because we now add money back to the equation, no part of the ""contract"" involved would ever waive any rights of *either party* that they already have in the case where money is not involved. This is not hard.

So, for example, if you paid a prostitute, she would define clear lines that you could and could not cross. She could say, no hair pulling, no slapping, and if you did either of those things, bam, session over, no refund. You broke the rules.

Now let's say you're having sex, and she just says, ya know what, I'm just not into it. Well, you certainly can't say ""I gave you money, so I get to keep having sex with you"" and then rape her. You'd have to stop having sex. But since you didn't do anything to break the contract, that means that *she* is breaking he contract, and you are entitled to a refund.

What is being discussed here is the cost of procedures in relation to themselves.

So, if there are two fruit drink stands, one selling lemonade and one selling exotic blood orange juice, it is understandable that the lemonade only costs $1, while the blood orange juice costs $2. After all, blood oranges are more expensive than lemons. But what we are talking about here is lemonade costing $100 a cup because turns out you don't actually buy lemonade, your employer does, and the lemon industry has lobbied congress and jacked up prices because they have the money to do so.

I think what's happening is you are equating the high ""cost"" of all medical procedures combined (as influenced by junk food, desire for exotic treatments, etc) with high ""cost"" of individual treatments when compared to what those treatments would cost without the insurance industry supplementing them.

I suppose if you count Berlin as a precedent...

&gt;I suppose that doesn't matter to you seeing as how you would support a progressive dictatorship over democracy.

You think our current system is a 'democracy' in anything other than name only? That's cute.

&gt;Obamacare is a shitty compromise that costs too much and barely benefits anyone.

Says you and your blue links. You think it would be hard for me to pull up links of my own arguing the exact opposite?

It's almost like you think your ideology is the only one that matters.

&gt;I'm not a bible thumper conservative and neither is Trump. 

Newsflash: Trump isn't any kind of anything. His entire platform is a rhetorical ass pull tailor made to pander to xenophobic, racist, religious cavemen. If you actually believe he believes in anything he says, you're a dupe. For you to sit here and argue his positions as if he's an actual genuine person with a defined political ideology and not just a reality TV star milking the spotlight and capitalizing on current anti-establishment sentiment is ludicrous.

&gt;And there is no historical evidence that a conservative supreme court would engage in judicial activism to change laws willy nilly how they see fit.

My fear isn't that the Supreme Court will 'change laws willy nilly', my fear is that they will make decisions that forward a very directed conservative agenda. You are honestly telling me that a conservative court wouldn't try to gut Roe v Wade with the upcoming Whole Woman's Health vs Hellerstedt? Or continue to uphold Citizens United? Your contention that somehow conservative justices are immune to ruling based on their personal convictions, but somehow liberal justices aren't is absurd.

&gt;I assume your talking about Obamacare. It'll collapse under its own weight within 3 years regardless of what Trump does.

Oh, ok. So your just gonna put out your opinion as fact then? Or is this some kind of back to the future situation where you have advance knowledge of future events? 

&gt;Conservative justices tend to actually read the constitution literally rather than pulling new interpretations out of thin air. I personally would rather new laws go through congress instead of being decided upon by a council of elders, but what do I know?

Just like a conservative to think interpreting a multi-hundred year old document literally is a good idea. Conservative (I.e. Christian) judges do their best to impose the moral system of Bronze Age goat herders. Please don't act like the Supreme Court won't go on a moral crusade/witch hunt if it goes conservative, Republicans whine and bitch about how they're really about less government, but as soon as you assholes get in positions of power, you immediately try to use that power to ban abortions, persecute LGBT+ individuals, blur the separation of church and state, undermine scientific inquiry with batshit education reforms...I could go on and on. 
And congress is so hopelessly corrupt, I don't know that it is much different than the ""council of elders"" you seem to fear. 

Either way, I'll take a council of elders making decisions based on a progressive agenda over ""we the people"" (if you honestly think congress actually represents the people) making decisions that get interpreted by a bunch of bible thumping, closet racist/homophobes...er, I mean *conservatives*.

&gt;This is not a game.

No it isn't.

&gt;What the Berners should be doing is solidifying their movement and pushing forward

What $hillsters should be doing is realizing that they are backing the most disliked Democratic candidate in recent history, and that plugging their ears to the MILLIONS of people within their own party who are fed up with progressive ideals being sacrificed so that the elite ruling class can keep raking in the cash is going to tear their party apart and hand the election to Trump.

This is the cycle of the outsider, and, of the two insanely popular outsider candidates, the Democrats are fortunate enough to have the one that isn't a complete fucking muppet. If you can't see that, and you think the answer is Hillary, then I don't know what to tell you.

Therefore, if Hillary supporters will back Bernie, but Bernie supporters won't back Hillary, then why don't all you Hillsters step into the light with the rest of us?

Then I spent 30$ on gas, 6$ at McDonald's, 5$ at a gas station for a random thing, another 3$ on a soda or something, and had a monthly 7$ charge hit my account for some random thing. Basically, I was on the road, and when you're on the road you end up buying little things, snacks, etc. just how it works. So, in the morning, when the check clears, what do you think happens? Do you think they clear the 200$ check and then start pulling out for the payments? If so, you don't know banks. The start with the debits, specifically the *largest ones first* and work down, then they add the credits. So 40 becomes 10, becomes 4 becomes *-1* and congratulations, you've just won your first 35$ overdraft fee. But wait, there's more! Those remaining 4 charges (all in all 4 transactions costing maybe 8-10$) all hit and *each one* gets you a 35$ overdraft fee. At this point, your account (with fees) sits at -215$, so obviously it is at this point that they clear your check. Hooray, you are now the proud owner of a bank account with a -15$ balance. As a thank you, here's a 12$ negative balance fee. Well go ahead and apply one of those to your account every 7 days until you bring your balance up.

Now you have no money, your card is locked, you have to borrow money from your uncle to buy gas to get home. Your next paycheck comes, but at this point your account is -50$ or so, and rent is due. So you get a friend to cash your check to pay your landlord, you have just enough to cover it, so you can't afford to pay the balance on the account. This continues, because every week the negative balance grows, and you don't magically have enough money to pay it off, you couldn't even pay off the lower amount. Then the bank sends you account to collections, they tack on fees, etc, and that 12$ in misc charges that overdrafted you ends up costing around *1200 mother fucking dollars.*

Well, remember now you're paying that 2.5-3.5% fee on every purchase you make. When your margins are razor thin (my net worth is the 20$ bill I have in my pocket) that 3.5% can make or break you.

Good luck with that. Have you ever tried putting money on a BlueBird card without physically living near a Walmart? It's easier to wire money to Afghanistan.

You should also reverse this exercise, starting from your highest falsetto note and working downward. Focus on actually paying attention to the muscles in your throat, try to feel and visualize them moving as you go up and down, be conscious of the break and try to smooth the edges inward.

Whoever already selects juries.

&gt; On what grounds?  

On whatever grounds the people responsible for selecting juries have historically been themselves selected.

Whos? The selector of the juries? In the same fashion that his (or her) bias is currently counteracted.

&gt;Can his decision be appealed? 

Using whatever methods currently available, if any, sure.

&gt;How do you determine the relevant expertise? 

Institutional credentials in the given field, or in the case of slightly less technical cases, a simple demonstrated proficiency?

The *process* of jury selection isn't really the issue, it's the *pool* of people you're selecting from. I don't think anyone here is saying that all juries in cases relating to technical fields be engineers with post-graduate degrees. But certainly the jurors should have at least some experience with computers to understand this case. The idea that any technical knowledge in a given field constitutes a negative bias, and furthermore, that this perceived bias is somehow worse than the obvious problem of how easy it is to sway laypeople with emotional appeals, is frankly ridiculous.

853,"This is true, but I think there is an easy workaround for this. A developer could simply create a virtual currency that is only used for giveaways and functions exactly the same as dollar for dollar transactions, but has no value outside of the game (so it's not the same as giving away cash).

As an example, instead of using an in game currency (which has all the negative aspects described by OP), a game could have all in game purchases listed in local currency equivalent terms. This is not to say it would allow for single purchases of $0.18 cents, you would still have to buy in game currency at the rate Apple sets (1 dollar increments, etc as described earlier), but the price of in game items would be in whatever currency you spent, not some arbitrary non intuitive currency system. Then you simply add another developer currency that is only used for in game giveaways that functions and purchases exactly the same as normal in game purchases. 

So, an upgrade might cost, say, 50 cents. Instead of saying it costs 100 coins or whatever, it can just cost 50 cents. If the dev wants to give away the upgrade as a bonus or gift, they can just give players 1 flooble (an in game currency I just made up), and hey, guess what? A flooble ia worth 50 cents and can buy you that upgrade, but it can't be used for anything outside the game, so it has no value, so it can't be regulated by govt, etc.

Problem solved. Oh wait, no it wasn't, because it's not really about protecting the consumer, it's done for exactly the same reasons casinos and theme parks do it.

883,"Buying giant chests is probably the worst way you could spend gems. Giant chests don't give you more variety of cards, just a ton of two or so cards. So you can spend 1k gems on giant chests and get a ton of useless cards like cannon, skeleton, etc. you also then have to spend gold leveling up.

The best use of gems is trading for gold and buying cards straight up. See an epic you don't have and want really bad? Now you can grab it. Use witch all the time and want to bring it to level 2? Ok, when she comes up in the store, grab her. Want exp? Buy a few rares and commons and donate them to your clan members? 

Are you an impatient 12 year old? Go ahead and rush those chests, baby, rushing a gold is wayyyyyyyy cheaper than buying a giant, and you'll probably get something nicer anyway.

Point is, if you go in with the mindset that there is a 'paywall' and the only way past it is to buy good cards, you're approaching it the wrong way. You already have the cards you need. There are people in legendary using cards found in arena 3 and earlier. It's all about strategy. Duel your friends, try out decks, watch replays where you get smoked and see what went wrong, copy decks that beat you.

But then I thought about it, and I've come around. I like the timer. For one, as OP points out, this allows casual players who don't want to put 12+ hours a day into this game to still have a chance at staying on pace with the rest of the player base. Sure, you can gem chests, but no player, casual or hardcore f2p, will compete with gemmers.

Also, I feel like it fosters community. Because you aren't allowed to endlessly grind chests using your same tried and true battle deck over and over, you instead are encouraged to have friendly battles with your clan mates, test out new strategies and card combinations. 

For any that played CoC, when you were grinding resources or troph, you pretty much use the same army over and over. Yes there are variations, but losing with one of those is too costly, so you stick with the tried and true. I think it's good to take the pressure off and encourage variety and experimentation.

All it takes is realigning your mindset a little bit. Instead of feeling entitled to grind levels for 18 hours a day, embrace the slower, more uniform leveling pace, and use all that extra grind free time to play around with new decks, chat with clan mates, watch some replays.

916,"So Domino's pizza has a thing called lava crunch cakes. Lava crunch cakes come in sets of two, the only kind of box they make is a two pack. When they were first released, I noticed that when I tried to order them, there was a drop down menu where I could select the quantity of crunch cakes in the order. The menu had the numbers 1, 2, 4, 6 etc... all the way up to 20 or so. I selected 1, thinking that meant 1 order of crunch cakes (a set of 2) but I noticed that when I added it to the cart, it cost $0.00. So I went back and selected 2, and this time it showed $4.99 in the cart. 

I'm thinking OK, so the number isn't how many orders you want, but how many individual crunch cakes you want....I didn't know you could order just one crunch cake, and why does it cost no money when I add it to the cart? So I revert it back to one cake, and place the order to see what happens.

My pizza shows up, and also what looks like a 2 pack of crunch cakes (no charge), but when I open the pack there is only one crunch cake inside (as I said, they don't even make an individual crunch cake box). Intent on further exploring my exploit, the next time I order Domino's I add the single free crunch cake, but this time I change the QTY field to ""2"". Sure enough, my order comes with 2 crunch cakes in one normal box!

So now I know a couple of things. I know that single crunch cakes are free, I know that I can alter the quantity field after selecting the single cake and it's still free, I know that orders for even numbers of cakes get combined into the normal box, and I know that the employees filling the order either don't notice or don't really care. 

Armed with this information, I see how far I can push it. Next order, fucking 10 crunch cakes. Keep in mind I'm getting the 2 for $5.99 deal most of the time, so my total with tax/delivery is like $15.35 or something like that. For 10 crunch cakes and 2 pizzas. And they bring me 10 crunch cakes and 2 pizzas, and no one seem to give a fuck, so for the next THREE MONTHS or so I'm living in crunch cake Valhalla. I'm ordering Domino's like 3 times a week because why not, free muthafukin crunch cakes totally offset my pizza cost. I'm asking homeless guys on the street if they want some crunch cakes, I have so many crunch cakes. You know what's awesome? Crunch cake in a bowl with a half pint of Ben and Jerry's on top. I ate crunch cakes until the words crunch cakes didn't even look like words to me anymore. 

After a while, I can't believe they haven't spotted my exploit. I'm thinking, the dream has got to end. So I mention to my girlfriend at the time that I think I should write an email to Domino's, let them know about the error. Maybe they'll give me a free pizza for life card or something awesome like that, for saving them so much money on crunch cake hackers like me. She dissuades me, convincing me that Domino's is a large, heartless corporation, and they probably won't give me shit, and fix the crunch cake exploit so we don't get anymore free crunch cakes. So I stay quiet, and continue gorging myself on crunch cakes until the website gets updated a month or so later, and the loophole was closed.

To this day, I kinda wonder what would have happened had I told Domino's what was up.

**TLDR; There used to be an exploit on Domino's website that allowed for unlimited free lava crunch cakes with any order. I probably ordered 200-300 free crunch cakes over the course of 4 or 5 months.**",2016-02-09 04:51:53+00:00,czt4hig,1.0,t3_44tard,24453.0,AskReddit

921,"&gt; If we can get 5,000 soldiers and thousands of tons of armaments into a desert we can surely get that food and medicine to that bean farmer.  

We aren't just talking about one bean farmer though, we're talking about getting teams of 5,000 troops to every point on earth simultaneously. The logistics of that is staggering. And that's just transport, you also have to *allocate* all of those resources, you have to figure out how much of what goes to where. That's hardly trivial.

&gt;  Some encourage a gift economy where those producers give whatever they make to whoever they want.

That sounds like a popularity contest to me, and in no way scalable. Beyond by grandmother deciding which one of her neighbors gets the pie she baked, I don't see how this could function on a national or global scale. And you better hope granny likes you, or you won't be getting much pie.

&gt; Also, some would support ""labor vouchers"" which would function similarly to money except its value would be based in labor as opposed to a gold standard since labor is what produces value and gold is just rocks.

Gold is just rocks in the same way that labor vouchers are just paper. Gold, paper, dollar bills, seashells, whatever you use for currency is just representing value that people agree upon, so I don't see labor vouchers as inherently having more value than gold, or any other arbitrary medium. How much would a labor voucher be worth, anyway? Who decides that? Is it hourly, so 1 hour of labor always equals one voucher? If it is, do different types of labor get different values, or is an hour shoveling coal the same value as an hour performing brain surgery? Does one hour of plumbing by an inexperienced plumber who only does an ok job get valued the same as a master plumber with 25 years of experience? It just seems to me that if we are going to have a thing that represents labor as a voucher, why not just stick to good old currency? It might not currently be applied correctly, but certainly in principal a system of currency could be used to reflect the labor that a person produces, but you'd have to have a market to put value on that labor, or decide that all labor was equal regardless of the task (which sounds horrible to me), or you'd have to have a committee (i.e. government) arbitrarily ascribe value to all labor as it saw fit.

&gt; Luxury items would still be produced because their are people who legitimately enjoy jewelcrafting and racecar making and whatnot.

I understand that they will be produced, but realistically, how are they distributed? A company that makes high end race cars makes, what, 100 a year? Less? Who gets those cars? I apologize if I come off as argumentative, but this is one of the parts that I have the hardest time grasping about a Socialist system.

&gt; But if the resources needed to make luxury items would be more immediately needed to make practical things then those practical things would get those resources.

This is the scariest part to me. When is there ever going to be a time when someone somewhere doesn't need something practical? In this system, luxury items simply wouldn't exist. And who decides what the definition of a practical item is? If we decide that lawnmowers aren't a luxury item, but a practical item, then we have to produce enough lanwmowers for everyone on earth that needs them before we can start making luxury goods again? Are TVs practical or luxury? Cars? Phones, laptops? For 9 billion people? And an update in 3 years when all the tech goes obsolete?

&gt; Also, the reason I used software as an examole was because it was so easy. A proof of concept, if you will. Distributing material luxuries would be more difficult, but it will be distributed.

You can't just gloss over that distinction, though. Distributing software is so much easier than manufacturing, packaging, and distributing a physical good, they aren't really comparable. I don't see how anyone knows the demand for a good without a market. I can imagine a situation where every single item on earth could be cheaply produced at-will in a short period of time, but it would require such technological advancements as to be science fiction at this point. And I want to get there, but I can't pretend that we're anywhere close to that kind of tech on a worldwide scale. And although I agree that in certain instances, we have a surplus of goods, I don't believe it's to a point that we could, say, duplicate the lifestyle of an upper-middle class American family for every person on earth. No way we're making 5 billion jet skis, boats, TVs, Playstations, and on and on.....

And I want access to those things, I want a world where I can have a thing called a jet ski and ride it whenever I want without being good friends with a guy that makes jet skis, or waiting on a list for 2 months so I can have an hour on the communal jet ski.

922,"So I don't really know what I am, kind of a futurist I guess, although I've described myself as Libertarian, Anarchist, a few other labels before I decided I didn't like labels. There are aspects of Socialism that interest me, mostly the goal of automating as much as we can so people don't have to work soul-crushing wage slave jobs, but can be free to pursue their own creative interests. I'm all about a nice safety net so people can eat and chill and survive and have families without having to work until they die. However, I can't seem to get past the idea that some form of monetary system needs to exist for this to work. Sure, we can have a high baseline, so no one is starving or homeless, but for the allocation of niche or luxury goods and services, I don't see a purely Socialist system working. Maybe you can help me out. 

&gt; Food, clothes, shelter, and medicine are the most important material things people need. Socialism puts emphasis on these things first. Then comes the fun stuff.

How exactly does this work? If the entire world woke up tomorrow and decided to be Socialist, would we stop producing luxury goods and only make food, clothing, shelter, and medicine until every person on earth had these basic necessities met? How long would it take to ensure that a Kazakhstani bean farmer had the same access to these necessities as a 20 something liberal arts major in Greenwich Village?

&gt; The people who wanted to be doctors, engineers, artist or whatever else but couldn't because they were too busy feeding themselves and their family can now pursue those interests uninhibited. These ambitious people who love to make things for the sake of making things will be the ones who create that niche thing you like. If you like playing with robots then all these engineers who used to be stuck behind cash register all day now have time to make kickass robots and R/C helicopters and what not.

I get the first part, obviously it's awesome to have people be able to pursue their interests. But how does the distribution work? In your R/C helicopter example, say we end up with a niche of 1000 R/C helicopter building enthusiasts, and three of those builders end up being way better at building helicopters than the other builders. Then the R/C helicopter craze hits and there are 5,000,000 people that all want R/C helicopters for Christmas this year, but of course they want one from these three builders, because they are the best. How does this work? Who gets first dibs on the helicopters created by these guys? How do they get them? Do the other 997 helicopter builders have to start building under the three leaders, since no one wants their inferior helicopter designs? How do we go about procuring the factors of production required to produce 5,000,000 R/C helicopters in time for Christmas? How do the 5,000,000 people that want one indicate to the builders that this is the case? Who decides whether it's more important to fill those 5,000,000 helicopter orders or to fill an equal sized order for 5,000,000 robotic dolphins that the robotic dolphin enthusiasts want for Christmas? I get how all this plays out for the basics, like food and medicine, but I'm baffled as to how you distribute and prioritize luxury goods.

&gt; You can see this already in the video game modding community. I mean, have you seen some of the shit these guys make in their spare time? They did it because they wanted to do it. These are the kinds of people who will be creating that niche thing you like; because I assure you, you are not the only person who likes that thing.

Right, but as it is often pointed out by piracy advocates, downloading isn't the same as stealing, because making a copy isn't the same as stealing an original. You see this in the modding community because these modders are making the mods for themselves, but because they are working in a digital medium, *it is incredibly convenient to distribute copies of their work for no additional cost to them.* Setting up a download link is trivial. If making a single copy of a mod to distribute took as much effort as making a second table after you've just designed and crafted the first one, then the modding community would be nonexistent. So again, I get how this would work with digital content, but how does this example hold up when talking about a physical product? If you are super into a niche type of leather bondage, and there was a guy modding suits just the way you like them, it's not like you can just go to his website and download a copy of the suit....he's gonna have to make one for you. How does this scale?

934,"Imagine a perfect pendulum in a vacuum with no friction. It swings to a certain height on one side, and then to the same height on the opposite side. When you add energy at one side (I.e. Give it a push) then the height of the pendulum swing increases on *both* sides, not just one. This illustrates how adding heat to the system causes weather to be hotter on the hot side, and colder on the cold side, it doesn't just affect one side, it affects everything. Hot gets hotter, cold gets colder.

The thing with weather is that it *isn't* like a pendulum, it isn't smooth and predictable, and it *isn't linear*. Adding energy doesn't just give you a perfectly correlated rise in global temperature, because things are far more interlinked than that. You have feedback loops where adding energy causes things to melt, which adds energy, which causes things to melt, etc etc (as in polar ice cap melting.) 

So because it is non-linear (get mad if you want, it just is), all we can do is try to predict what the weather will be like at a given time and place. Meteorology is not an exact science, which is why the weatherman telling you that it's going to be 72 degrees and sunny is not the same as your math teacher saying that adding 2 to 2 will produce 4. All global warming is trying to say is that we are getting to a point where we've added enough energy in the system that we can no longer predict accurately what the weather is going to do.

We've had a fairly accurate model for how the weather fluctuates for millennia, our entire agriculture system, among other things, is based on having an accurate model for weather prediction.

939,"Your hang up seems to be in thinking of the temperature increase as a static rise in the whole model (I.e draw a simple wave on a piece of paper and then just kind of nudge it up a little, keeping the same wave amplitude) when it's really an increase of energy in the system.

As a very crude example, imagine you are driving a car at 60mph. What we are talking about with a 2C increase is not a matter of accelerating the car to 62mph and then keeping it there, which would seem like a small, insignificant change.

What we are talking about is every time you step on the brake pedal or the accelerator, you are doing so with 2 pounds more pressure from your foot, so the amount you brake and accelerate increases. 

So, the question you are basically repeatedly asking an for an explanation to is ""why does my car stop faster when I step on the brake pedal harder?""
This question has an obvious answer, which is why some posters are getting annoyed at your refusal to accept what is being told to you.

A credit score is a measure of creditworthiness; creditworthiness, in turn, is the credit industry’s definition of who will make the industry the most money for the least risk. So the highest credit ratings go to people who:
1) use multiple but not many credit cards — they can be counted upon to spend money but not go bankrupt;
and
2) carry a modest balance — that is, they pay interest with little risk of not being able to pay that interest.
Credit scores are bullshit for cutomers…they tell you nothing about yourself. And that’s because credit scores were created for lenders. They’re not bullshit for them: it’s how they systematically identify the most profitable customers.

Second, you seem to have a very pure libertarian view on consumer choice and markets, and unfortunately, the real world simply doesn't work that way.

1132,"Gold relics have the same upgrade path as blue relics. As with blue, each gold relic requires another gold relic to reach level 1, 3 more for lvl 2, etc. You can absorb relics of both types in a merged relic, and the type you merge will be applied to the appropriate exp bar. For example: You have a Lvl 1 Blue Relic and a Lvl 1 Gold Relic. You absorb another blue relic with the original, raising its level to 2. You then merge the Gold and Blue relics, creating a two stat relic. You then absorb another gold relic, raising the lvl of gold relic stat in the two stat relic to lvl 2. 

That's why, in the big guide, it is suggested to focus on blue relics more than gold, since they are comparatively much simpler to upgrade. The amount of Cred required to level up a full set of gold relics AND merge them is pretty staggering...better to focus on leveling blue relics and merging all your golds with them (keeping the golds at lvl 1). Once you've gotten all the gold relics merged with blue, then start working on levelling them up.",2015-09-29 05:59:51+00:00,cvhts16,1.0,t3_3lbbkr,1001628.0,Ezpzrpg

1145,"ESPN standard scoring, 12 team league

So, I just traded Davante Adams and Joseph Randle (28 pts, ouch) for Demaryius Thomas. Another player in my league has been targeting Thomas, and he just offered me a trade for Brandon Marshall and any of his running backs.

Here is the situation:
My current WR: Demaryius Thomas, Allen Robinson, Alshon Jeffery (hurt), Dez Bryant (picked up off wire this morning, also hurt), Leonard Hankerson, Devin Funchess (may drop after this week)

My current RB: Jamaal Charles, Lamar Miller (he's scaring me with his production), Tevin Coleman (hurt), Bishop Sankey (wire pickup)

As you can see, losing Randle has hurt my RB depth badly, with Coleman hurt, and Freeman doing so well in his absence, I worry about his starting role moving forward. If Miller doesn't get it together, I'll be stuck with Sankey as my RB2, which is not how you win leagues.

So, here are my choices for RB:

C.J. Anderson (will he ever produce?)
Devonta Freeman (that would lock up Atlanta backfield)
Frank Gore (a beast...when healthy)
LeGarret Blount (a workhorse, but I've been burned by NE backs before)
Chris Ivory
Ronnie Hillman

The question: Should I hold Demaryius and try to make a smaller trade to upgrade an RB, or should I pull the trigger on this trade? If I DO make the trade, which back should I choose? It's pretty much between Anderson and Gore, with some maybes towards Blount and Freeman).
