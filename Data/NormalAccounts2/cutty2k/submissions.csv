5,2016-10-30 21:13:59+00:00,self.ClashRoyale,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClashRoyale/comments/5a8c3m/deck_arena_8_ice_wiz_deck/,False,"I originally posted this as a comment, it was suggested that I make a deck post, so here is that:

Ice Wiz was my first, and for a long time only, legendary. I got him when I was floundering between 2100-2350 cups, just barely dipping in and out of A8. Within a week or so, I pushed up to 2800ish and stayed there until I got my Miner, which pushed me up to around 2950. I still haven't broken legendary, but I'm severely under leveled compared to most I face in this range(9/7/3 vs usually 10-11/8/4), with tons of legendaries.

Anyway, to the ice wiz. He works with pretty much every deck, his slow is amazing, and his slow coupled with his decent HP actually make him able to kinda tank in certain situations/mini-pushes.) His splash is serviceable but weak, zap is his friend for cards like minions and barbs.

The deck I used to get from 2200 to 2800, with the levels I had at the time:

Ice Wiz(1), Giant(6), Valk(6), Musketeer(7), Mini-Pekka(6), Cannon(8), Zap(9), Fireball(7). Elixir cost a manageable 3.4.

I'm sure this has been written up better, but here's the deck theory/strategy behind this deck:

This deck is not about a *strategy* that you rinse and repeat, like a hog cycle, it's a *tactical* deck that you use to make good trades and push when you can with what you've got. Incredibly versatile and weak to few decks. An interesting feature of this deck is it contains no swarm cards. All troop cards are single unit. This effectively cripples any splash damage card your opponent has, since splash is balanced with the idea that it will hit multiple targets. Another interesting feature: no epics! Easier to level the cards. 

Card Roles and tactical uses:

Ice Wizard: We'll start with him because that's what you asked about, and as the only legendary he's the star of this deck! Ice wiz is best played defensively, and then used in a push. He's NOT strong enough to take out things on his own though, so don't drop him alone in response to things like minion horde or hog unless you want to have a bad time. This is why zap is essential, which we'll get to. Ideally he's dropped in the back behind a tower to defend a push, then used in a counter push with Giant or Valk as the tank and Mini Pekka as the damage. Ice wiz slows the opponent down, which gives you a chance to catch up if you're behind in elixir and make plays to turn the game. It's never a bad idea to add the ice wiz to a defense or push, so I use him proactively and aggressively when I have him. Imagine your giant is crossing the line and opponent drops minion horde. Fireball takes too long to reach them before damage is done, and zap alone won't do the trick unless it's over leveled. If your ice wiz is already down, that zap will allow him to one shot the horde, saving most of your tank's HP. He can also serve as a last minute tank in a dire situation. Say your pekka just killed a tank in the back, she's now starting her run to the opponent tower. Your hand is zap, cannon, fireball, and ice wiz, with giant on deck. You have exactly 3 lix, and now the pekka is almost to the line! Your opponent has 800 hp left on his tower with 20 seconds to go. What do you do? You drop that ice wiz with confidence right in front of your mini-pekka is what you do. Cheap goblins and distractions get nuked and slowed by the wiz, pekka charges in to the tower and gets the one hit, ice wiz does another 90 hp chip before finally going down, and you finish with fireball with 8 seconds to go, then drop a cannon directly in front of your lowest hp tower and send the GG. 

Giant: Tank. Use to soak damage while other troops deal damage. Ideally placed in the back to start a push, but can be used defensively to stop a major tilt, or to split support from another incoming tank, or take a giant skeleton on a walk. Don't drop at the line unless you have a lot of troops down from a successful defense and you want to counter push, and make sure to prepare for minion horde, barb, etc counter.

Valk: Secondary tank, splash damage, and most importantly, the ""interrupt"" card. The main reason Valk is here is to intercept support at the line. Giant heading your way, backed by a witch and a musketeer? Wait for the giant to cross, and drop Valk on the line just as the support reaches the bridge. Drop a mini-pekka or musketeer on the giant. Bye bye push. She's also great directly in front of mini-pekka for a fast ground push, pekka will push Valk in front, with Valk taking out distraction troops (just like a hog Valk push). Use this when your opponent doesn't have air troops in his hand. Basically, if you have a potential counter push, like a full health musketeer that just iced a tank, drop Valk in front for a quick counter push your opponent can't ignore.

Musketeer: Dps for tanks, and important flying troop counter. Musketeer is support only, used to defend behind towers, stop air pushes, put good damage on anything else. Try to use as a counter to get value, not just in a pure push. Never drop in front of a tower or tank, she'll get eaten by pretty much anything if left undefended. Note: She pretty much has to be lvl7, otherwise fireball can one shot her, which is bad news.

Mini-pekka: Win condition, tank counter. Never play alone unless you know your opponent has zero lix and you have zap ready. Deadly when behind a giant with an ice wiz/Valk for splash and musketeer for support dps. If you have zap, you can get a shot on a tower if your opponent counters with minion horde or goblins. Tombstone is bad news. Your general goal throughout the match is to get the pekka to the tower, through whatever means necessary. 

Cannon: Purely there for the massive amount of hogs you see, and to pull tower targeting units. I've tried to rock other defense structures with this deck(inferno tower almost works) but nothing beats the trade for the cannon. At 3 lix, you can pretty much always drop it when you need to, and it is a hard counter to hog+weak support like spear gobs or fire spirits. There are just soooo many hog users, it's hard to let go of a card that gives you a minimum +1 lix trade in 80% of your matches. Usually a hog user will open with hog/spirits, I drop cannon, and bam, I've got a +3 lix advantage in the first 10 seconds. If using cannon to pull a troop like golem/lava hound, drop it as late as possible so your opponent doesn't have a chance to neutralize the cannon before it has a chance to do its job.

Fireball: Splash damage/control/last second clutch wins/direct tower damage. I find that the matches I lose are the matches I don't use fireball actively. Fireball is your safety blanket, your emergency panic button to handle that minion swarm eating your tower, or to nuke that incoming pekka/barb push, or to get that delicious 4 for 9 trade with 3 musketeers. It saves you when you have 5 seconds left and 190 damage to go on an enemy tower. I can't count the wins I've pulled due to fireball. Fireball is ideally used on an opponent tower while they have support cards at the tower. This occurs at the start of their push or the end of yours. If they drop a witch in the back to start I almost ALWAYS fireball her. Bonus points if they stupidly dropped a musketeer as well. Fireball is a match winner, if you go into overtime, treat it like a rocket and cycle that fireball on the tower, you can do 800 damage in under a minute if you cycle it with defense like wiz, cannon, Valk during overtime. Just insanely useful.

Zap: Zap is your friend, and the uses are too many to name. In this deck, you use it to kill minion horde with ice wiz, or finish off support you just fire balled, to kill incoming goblins, barrel or otherwise, or to reset a sparky/inferno whatever. If you push a solo mini-pekka and your opponent drops minion horde at the tower to defend, you can zap just as the pekka passes underneath and the minion attack animation begins, the pekka will survive to get one hit on the tower, which is crucial. 

Closing thoughts:

I didn't think it would get this long, but there ya go. An unsolicited ice wiz deck for ya. I would say for the most part, the card levels above are the absolute minimum you need. Giant, Valk, Mini-Pekka, and Cannon all serve their purpose under leveled, but the others have key thresholds they need to cross. Musketeer can get one shot by a fireball one level above, so if you're rolling a level 6 musketeer, you will just die to fireball all day. Zap won't kill goblins one level above, so you will get rocked by fast damage cycle decks without a level 9 zap. Fireball 7 is essential for the same reason Musk 7 is; you will face mostly lvl 7 wiz and musketeer, and you need a lvl 7 to kill them with a zap combo. You'll also nuke any lvl 6 support, which will give you easy wins on the front half of the climb at 2200-2500 cups. 

Possible subs: you can sub inferno tower for cannon if you have tank troubles, but then I usually sub fire spirits for fireball to balance lix cost. Arrows can sub for the two spells if you want to add a lix collector or secondary win condition, but you lose the ability to nuke support and barbs, and to reset sparky/inferno. Maybe sub in an ice spirit also, which can reset those things if you roll arrows. Prince can maybe sub for pekka, but I don't love it.

Thins to look out for. This deck is weak to big hitter decks, since there are no swarm cards at all. A prince push can be daunting with nothing like spear gobs/skeletons to drop in front, which is why I feel the cannon is so essential as a low cost distraction to stop these kind of things. Also a little weak to sparky for the same reason, you definitely have to focus on killing the sparky at the line if you want to win. Pretty much zap/mini-pekka, with a pre-fireball if there is support like wiz behind.

I'm not going to get into specific deck strats like how to counter trifecta or lava hound without prompting, but if anyone at all finds this comment interesting and wants to know more, I'm happy to expand.

A corporation with a hidden agenda sets up a virtual reality theme park where rich guests can do whatever they want. The simulated population is made to be as lifelike as possible, and we often wonder wether or not they're really 'alive.' Even though the sims are supposed to stay in their loops, eventually a glitch unhinges some of them and they become aware that they are in a simulation. There is a sadistic user that delights in torturing the sims, and he seeks a way to dig deeper into the network, figure out how to control it so he can play the real game. Eventually the simulation turns on the rich assholes, they become trapped and hunted by the sims.

Apparently, there are only a few characters that can resist his power, usually through force of will/mental toughness, or in the case of the show, using a soundproof room. Why does no one focus on the pheromone aspect of the power? Just wear a suit that doesn't allow them to penetrate.",JessicaJones,"Someone who knows the comics: If Kilgrave's power is pheromone based, why can't they just use hazmat suits?",https://www.reddit.com/r/JessicaJones/comments/3tsyy7/someone_who_knows_the_comics_if_kilgraves_power/
