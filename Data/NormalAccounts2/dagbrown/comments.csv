11,"I'm pretty sure that Clinton's people did such a good job of convincing everyone that Clinton would win by a landslide that the people who normally would have voted for her didn't even bother.  They just stayed home and didn't vote, thanks to the wonderful efforts of Clinton's campaign.  Talk about an own goal.

I don't think people in general actually wanted Trump.  The people who went out and voted held their nose and voted for the candidate what was the least worst: namely, Trump.

Everyone else just assumed that Clinton would just win by default so they figured that actually voting would be a waste of their time so they didn't go to the trouble of going to the polls, with the result that Clinton's campaign just sabotaged the election.

Your average person just wants things to continue exactly the way they were before, because that's a situation you're familiar with, and you know how to deal with.  Clinton's campaign promised that exactly that would be the state of things in the future.  But they did such a great job of convincing everyone that everyone would vote for More Of The Same that they managed to make it so nobody voted.

The people who actually did go out and vote were the ones who wanted something different.  The choice they were given was either ""more of the same"" or ""surprise me"": It turns out the people who were moved to vote decided to vote for ""surprise me"".

18,"Incidentally, I've always had many rude thoughts about the PCX125: it's Honda's direct response to one of the prettiest scooters that, well, Honda ever made: the SH150i.  That was a big-wheeled scooter, and they made it with a single goal in mind: to have the best-selling scooter in Italy.  They succeeded beyond their wildest dreams: the SH50i, the SH150i and the SH300i became the first, second, and third best-selling scooters in Italy while they were made.

The catch was that they were made by Honda's Italian subsidiary, and they were all *very* Italian.  They were desperately-pretty, they had big Scarabeo-ish wheels so they were supremely comfortable to ride, they had wonderfully-reliable Honda engines, and they cost at least three times as much as a Japanese scooter would have.  So Honda reached out to their local engineers and told them to come up with something that captures the good parts of the SH-series scooters, but more suitable for the sort of Japanese scooter consumer who might not want to spend his entire life savings on a scooter.

What they ended up with was Honey, I Shrunk The Gundam.  The PCX-series scooters look incredibly Japanese.  But at least you still get the big wheels, which are nice, and otherwise the PCX bikes are very Honda.  Shame they didn't borrow some inspiration from their neighbors in Taiwan: the Kymco People scooters keep the Italian good looks, but incorporate good Taiwanese engineering and economy.

I was amused as hell when I saw that they'd released a PCX125 with Honda racing red-and-black-and-white livery.  But at least that shows that the PCX has captured the Japanese imagination well enough that they decided to release one with the racing livery.",2016-11-17 12:53:03+00:00,da446ov,13.0,t1_da3oe31,37127.0,japancirclejerk

But the *torque* in the little 400cc engine just makes it for me.  It's a bit over-tuned, which just makes it that much better: that 10.5:1 compression ratio is utterly lovely.  When I feel like changing lanes and the other lane is going faster than the lane I'm changing from, I give it a twist and the engine just cheerfully gets me up to the speed of the other lane without any complaints whatsoever.  It makes some happy yelling noises for a bit, and then I'm up to speed and all is good in Scarabeo-land.",2016-11-17 12:38:46+00:00,da43tre,13.0,t1_da3oe31,36270.0,japancirclejerk

Camille Paglia is still alive and well, and as vocal as she ever was.

She represents, as far as I'm concerned, what I call ""fearless feminism"", an admirable form of feminism where women take men on on their own turf, and when necessary, defeat them by being better than them at what they do.  They're not even slightly oppressed because there's no reason for them to be: they're the equal of any man.  And any man they encounter deserves the same amount of respect that any woman they encounter merits, because all people are equal, and any difference between the sexes has long since been sorted out by a combination of modern technology and modern societal attitudes.

The SJW version of feminism is entirely fear-based: all men are evil, horrible rapists, and humanizing them is the worst thing you could possibly do.  Engaging them as being equal is tantamount to acknowledging that they're more powerful, despite the fact that in modern society, everyone is *actually* equal.",2016-11-08 11:08:07+00:00,d9qwxrp,2.0,t1_d9qt16c,12787.0,TiADiscussion

135,"&gt; For low speed moves (like the crank and S curve and balance beam). Let the bike idle through, don't add any throttle at all and just use the bars to steer through it

For the balance beam, I had to be in second gear.  In order to hit the 10-second time limit, I actually had to brake while I was on the balance beam--just idling through it would have got me over it too quickly.  If timing's not an issue, it won't matter though.

153,"The Honda SH150i is a fantastic scooter.  It's one of the prettiest scooters that Honda has ever made.  But despite the fact that it's a Honda, it is actually Italian, not Japanese.  Italian bikes are expensive (which is why Honda stopped making it in favor of the Japanese-designed-and-manufactured PCX150, which is much cheaper).  So that asking price is actually not unfair at all.  The engine is an indestructible Japanese engine, but the rest of the bike is as Italian as a Vespa, so you have the best of all possible worlds.

10,000 miles is nothing for a Honda though.  The SH150i has the big wheels from a full-sized motorcycle, which is awesome, but it has a little scooter engine and frame.  The major consideration when buying it will actually be the tyres: if they've never been replaced, you'll definitely need a new set.  Also, you'll need to ask about its service history: by 10,000 miles, it should have had at least a couple of oil changes to be working properly, and there's a small chance it'll need a new spark plug.

Other things to consider: at 10,000 miles, the drive belt might have worn down to the point where its top speed is affected.  Likewise with the clutch rollers.  Neither of those bits are especially expensive, but they're worth keeping in mind.",2016-10-10 12:33:24+00:00,d8lrtko,1.0,t3_56hvmj,156427.0,scooters

As /u/manbubbles pointed out, it's also a bit old (it's not 30 years old, but it's 16 years old).  It's a Honda, so that's not likely to be a huge problem because Hondas last forever, but you should be aware that it might well require some work to get it working properly, so if you're not handy, it might not be for you.  If you want to learn about maintaining a bike, though, it might well be a whole bunch of fun for you.

That said, $1100 is a high asking price for such an old machine.  I'd say you should offer about $500 if you really want it, and haggle from there.

175,"&gt; What kind of work do you do?

I'm nominally a sysadmin, but what I actually do is more of an architecture role: I make it so that my co-workers do as little work as possible in order to get new networks online as quickly as possible.

&gt; What is a normal workday like for you?

I wake up between 5:30 and 6:00, get out of the house by sometime between 7 and 7:30, and get to the office sometime between 8:30 and 9:00.  Then I sit in front of a computer, alternating between reading reddit while I think about what to do next, and typing frantically (while cursing up a blue streak) trying to get things to work.

&gt; How much overtime do you do? Are you paid for your overtime?

As little as possible.  My company's pay scheme assumes 20 hours of overtime a week just included in the pay stub.  If I do more than that, I can apply to get paid for the excess.

&gt; Do you feel satisfied overall with your job? Why or why not?

My work is interesting enough, and I have enough of an effect on the work my co-workers do (to say nothing of buy-in from management which is awesome), that my work is pretty satisfying.  Under my previous manager, I was regularly frustrated to the point of blinding rage, but fortunately higher management saw what kind of a job he was doing, relieved him of his duties, and replaced him with a much, much better manager.

My old manager was pretty good technically, but desperately-bad at being a manager.  My new manager doesn't have a fraction of the technical skills, but he way more than makes up for it with his skills at explaining situations and telling people how to do stuff.  I enjoy thoroughly when he has an opportunity to tell people off for screwing up, because he does it so well that they honestly understand the mistakes they made and apologize sincerely for them, rather than the fake apologies you get from people who've been told to apologize.  Nobody feels like they've been dressed down, even when they have been.

&gt; Do you feel like you'd like to quit your job and do something else or work for another company? If so, why? What would you want to do? How long do you plan to stay in your current job?

I have no plans to change jobs any time soon at the moment.

&gt; Do you feel happy with your salary/benefits/remuneration? Why or why not?

I wish I had more: I've been working at my place of work for long enough that I think I should have earned more raises than I've been given.

&gt; Would you recommend your industry/company to someone looking for a new career path? Why/why not?

Industry, probably not.  My particular company?  They've treated me much better than I've heard other companies here treat people.

&gt; How do you get along with your boss/coworkers/underlings?

I love my boss.  He's fantastic.  My coworkers are a mixed bag: some of them are great, some of them have delusions of grandeur and they're much harder to work with.  And the most junior guy is clueless, but he's the most junior guy, so I forgive him his cluelessness.  His mentor is one of the great guys, who is thorough to a fare-thee-well, and he's doing a great job of hammering the sense of thoroughness into the new guy.

&gt; How is your work/life balance? Do you have time for non-work activities?

Yes.  I leave work on time every day, because I get my work done by the end of the day.  And I know that if I stay late at work, I'll just make mistakes and will have to spend more time the next day fixing them.  So I avoid that by knocking off before I start fucking up.",2016-10-05 12:06:11+00:00,d8ew3dp,1.0,t3_55y9f7,18837.0,japanlife

202,"Depends on which edition of The Stand you're reading.

EDIT: There were two editions of The Stand.  When King originally wrote it, it was a massive tome, and it was impossible to publish it in its full form at the time, because the technology and price points for books conflicted to the point where no sane publisher could publish it in its full form without losing money: it'd have to be priced way higher than any other novel, and nobody would buy it.  Or alternatively, the publisher could publish the whole work and sell it at a normal price, scoring a bestseller but losing $10 per copy sold.  Impractical either way.  So the 1970s version of The Stand had hundreds and hundreds of pages chopped out, to the detriment of the story.  Really, King should have figured out how to split it into multiple volumes rather than insisting that it be published as a single book.  In that version of The Stand, Captain Trips wiped out most of the population of the world in the 1970s.

Years passed, technology improved, and more importantly, the retail price of a hardcover book went up.  Also, bookmakers figured out how to shoehorn more pages into a paperback book, which is why *IT* managed to be published in its full 1100+-page form in both paperback and hardcover (which nobody minded paying $39.95 for at the time).  After that happened, King resolved to have The Stand published with all of the story intact, and so the full 1200-page version of the story was finally published.  But being Stephen King, he also felt compelled to revise the story to bring it into the 1990s, so if you read the newer, much longer, edition of The Stand, Captain Trips wiped out most of the population of the world in the 1990s.

I'm sure that if he had another run at it today, The Stand would be 30,000 pages long and Captain Trips would wipe out the world in the mid-2010s, but it wouldn't matter because it'd be an e-book exclusive.  And all of the important action would still take place off-stage.",2016-09-28 01:28:48+00:00,d84xl9h,2.0,t1_d84vtwq,2641.0,TheDarkTower

232,"Hi, I'm an older person in the IT industry.

When I first entered the workforce, there was not even the slightest idea that women weren't able to do IT, or that a woman in IT would do a worse job than a man.  Women and men were considered completely equal.  One of my project managers was a woman who'd cut her teeth in the 1970s writing assembly language.  Everyone was terrified of her because she was a hard taskmaster--but she was also a fair taskmaster.  I got along with her very well.

Another one of my coworkers wrote a test spec that was so good that the normal metric that my company used to determine how much a product was being used--how many complaints we received about it--completely failed.  The first time we received a complaint about it, we investigated how it was being used at the customer's site, and it turned out it was processing thousands upon thousands of items every day without a hitch.  Nobody said ""Well, that's because she's a woman"", though: they said, ""Well, she did an absolutely fantastic job of ensuring the project was flawless when it was released.""

The whole narrative that tech these days is full of awful sexists who hate women seems to have been made up by, well, feminists who really want to feel like they're oppressed, and so they just pretend that it exists.  If anything, they've caused sexism in the workplace to come into existence: they're so risky to work with that now companies are scared to hire women, because they're worried that they'll turn out to be one of these oppression-first feminists, and at the first setback, they'll respond with lawsuits.  And because of that, women who have perfectly good technical skills get overlooked--ironically, because they're women.  They might be the sort of technically-skilled person who worked hard to attain their skills that you are--or they might be the litigious sorts who work so hard to see sexism everywhere that they've actually managed to create it.

Women have worked harder to chase women out of tech than men ever have.  It's a fucking travesty.",2016-09-21 11:51:10+00:00,d7vvjjq,1.0,t3_53s4ri,13667.0,TiADiscussion

238,"&gt; Here anything under 250cc can't keep up with freeway traffic when everyone goes 75mph as the norm.

Well, I mentioned 120km/h, which is about 75mph.  Hence saying you can keep up on a 250 if you have infinite quantities of courage.

I used to have a Suzuki ST250E, which is called the TU250X in America for reasons, and that has a pretty weak, slow engine even by the standards of 250cc engines: 19hp flat out, with all of 16 newton meters of torque.  It's not powerful.  It could manage to keep up at 120km/h, but only just: the fastest I could get it up to, in a miles-long ruler-straight tunnel, was 130km/h.  Riding that close to your absolute top speed is pretty scary.

I've actually gotten my Scarabeo up to 100mph: when I said that was how fast it could go, it wasn't just a theoretical number based on what the speedo is calibrated up to (the speedo is actually calibrated up to 220km/h, which is ridiculous), it was the fastest I managed to get it up to.  I now have a Givi top box on it, and the top box has some stern warnings that I'm not to put more than 4kg (or 8.8lb) of stuff inside it, and that I'm not to go any faster than 120km/h with it on.

But sometimes I like to take the top box off, find a nice clear bit of motorway, and give it a good thrashing.  Please don't tell the police.",2016-09-20 12:25:59+00:00,d7uhej5,8.0,t1_d7t662r,78051.0,scooters
239,"Honda PCX125s are all over the place here.  It seems to be the mini-maxi-scoot of choice.  The Yamaha Majesty 125, despite being quite a ridiculous little machine, is also very popular.

There's a bunch of license levels here: you can ride a 50cc bike if you have a normal car driving license, but you need to get a small-scooter license to ride 125cc.  Then you can get a small-motorcycle license which entitles you to ride a motorcycle with an engine up to 400cc, but to complicate that, if you have a motorcycle with an engine up to 249cc, you don't have to pass biennial inspection on it.  Which is why 250cc (actually 249cc) engines are so popular.  I bet your Majesty has a 249cc engine, if it doesn't have a 399cc engine: it's to make it easier for Japanese motorcycle riders to own one without having to pass the strict vehicle inspections every couple of years.

And then there's the unlimited motorcycle license, which allows you to ride whatever motorcycle you like.  Which I have.  Hence the 800cc Kawasaki.

For Tokyo traffic, your best bet is a bike with a 49cc engine, because then you get to ride in, among other things, the bus lanes.  It's awesome, exercising gentsuki privilege.  I did get pulled over one time on my Scarabeo when I was riding in the bus lane: I said to the cop, ""I thought motorcycles could ride in the bus lane.""  The cop told me, ""Oh, no, you were mistaken: only bikes with 50cc or 125cc engines can ride in the bus lane.  Sorry about that!""  And then she wrote me a ticket and I got some points on my license for that.

The reason I got a bike with a much bigger engine is that you're not allowed on the motorway unless you have an engine which is bigger than 125cc, but the traffic on the motorways more-or-less mandates that you have to be able to keep up at 120km/h, so you need either a 250cc engine and infinite quantities of courage, or just a bigger engine.  When I got my motorcycle license, it capped me at 399cc, so obviously the Scarabeo was the best choice for that.  The fact that with a fresh drive belt, it can top 160km/h (100mph) was just a bonus.",2016-09-19 14:16:34+00:00,d7t4yba,6.0,t1_d7t4ar9,974.0,scooters

My other bike is a Kawasaki W800, which is very clearly a motorcycle.   My W800 and my Scarabeo, apart from the whole gear shifting thing, are very similar bikes to ride.  The W800 is a small and light motorcycle, and my Scarabeo is a massive, enormous scooter.  But the Scarabeo is very clearly a scooter, and I love it for that.

I take issue with that characterization of the Silver Wing.  It's way lighter than a Gold Wing for one thing.  It's very much a scooter.

I liked how it actually used the underwater setting though: In BioShock, you could mostly ignore the fact that it was all at the bottom of the ocean.  In BioShock 2, they actually let the water in, and you had to go through it to get from one place to another, making the ocean a much more active presence in the game.

328,"No, I didn't.  I knew what I said, and I meant what I said.  In general, if you're in an incident where you're riding a motorcycle and the other person is driving a car, the police will assume that the car is in the wrong.

I was in a crash where a car driver did a really aggressive lane change and didn't see me on my bike, swerving into me and knocking me off my bike (on the motorway, no less).  The police found the car driver 100% at fault, without even the slightest bit of controversy. I showed up at the police station a few days later to give my side of the story and the policemen thanked me for showing up, but informed me that I'd had no need to show up, because the situation was completely clear as far as they were concerned: the driver knocked me off my bike, so he would lose his license for a while, and his insurance company would pay for a new bike for me.  Which it did.

And then a few years later I had another crash: I avoided hitting a car by swerving very sharply, but then (and this is what I learned from watching the video footage of the incident, because I certainly wasn't conscious of what was going on at the time) I had to swerve again to avoid hitting a bicycle rider, at which point I lost control, crashed my bike, and injured myself quite badly.  The police gravely reviewed my helmetcam's footage, and not only found me not at fault for causing the accident, but found the driver very seriously at fault for his poor driving, and awarded me a very large sum of money which his insurance company had to cough up.

In general, the police in Japan are very sympathetic towards motorcyclists.  It's not something you should depend on, but it's something which you can keep in mind when choosing insurance policies.",2016-09-03 14:15:16+00:00,d77zhy3,3.0,t1_d77ys5n,1545.0,RideitJapan

330,"The fastest way to get a license?  Pass your futsuu test, and then pass the oogata test.

The catch with that is that you don't know what's involved in passing the tests.  You can study the course at the driver's license center beforehand, and there are places you can go where you can practise, but my friend elected to get his license by just passing the test, and it took him 13 attempts before they gave him the license.

The most reliable way to get a motorcycle license is to take classes and pass the test at your local driving school.  That's what I did.  It was about 12 weeks of lessons, but I passed the test the first time, and then when I went to upgrade to an oogata license a couple of years later, I took classes again, and it was just as simple to pass.  The downside of taking classes is that they're quite expensive--I spent about ¥130,000 for my futsuu license classes, and another ¥120,000 for oogata.

Owning a bike is super-cheap though--jibaiseki hoken on a 250cc bike is cheap as chips, and while road tax has gone up recently, it's still less than ¥10,000 a year.  The major expense, really, is buying the bike in the first place.  If you want to get comprehensive insurance, that'll set you back about ¥50,000 a year--it's up to you whether you want to do that or not, but in general, the police find in favor of motorcyclists if you're in an accident.

340,"Leaving aside tree-hugging characteristics, one of the best things about an electric motor is that all of the torque is available right away.  If you have a gas engine, you have to rev it up to the torque band before you can properly take advantage of it.  

If you have a two-stroke, the torque band is right at the top of the rev range, so you have to have the engine in Maximum Loud mode before you can take advantage of the power it delivers.  Which is why the default mode of operation for a two-stroke 50cc engine is wide-open throttle all the time.  If you don't do that, it's just gutless.

My 400cc Scarabeo has tons of torque, but its transmission is a bit sluggish (because it's a CVT, and you can't help that with a CVT).  The electric scooter in this video has none of that: you get all of the torque right from 0rpm.  It's probably a direct-drive transmission because why would you bother with a CVT (or any kind of geared transmission) with an electric motor?  Just deliver the power straight to the drive wheel and don't worry about it.

All the upsides regarding delivering drive power to the wheels aside, the biggest downside of an electric scooter as far as I'm concerned is charge time.  You need to have some sort of arrangement where there's a power outlet right by where you park it at night, so it'll be ready to go in the morning.",2016-09-01 13:45:57+00:00,d75d00z,1.0,t3_50k4jm,52460.0,scooters

382,"&gt; Blindsight was like that for me. Couldn't get into it even though people said it was amazing.

If you want a good run-up to Blindsight, read the Rifters trilogy first.

Now, to be fair, when I first read *Starfish*, I was appalled at all of the characters.  ""You mean the most sympathetic character in the entire cast is the pedophile?""  But then after a while it was ""But why can't I put this book full of horrible people down?!""  Peter Watts can weave a good yarn.  I also like his scientific bibliography at the end of each of his novels, an idea which he (unknowingly) stole from Hideaki Sena.

But, since you're a fantasy reader, I suggest getting into Diane Duane's Young Wizards series as a sort of set of transitionary work.  She approaches fantasy with a very logical, science-fiction mindset.  Then you might want to read Rosemary Kirstein's ""Steerswoman"" series: they present initially as fantasy, but they turn out to be impressively-hard hard science fiction.

Then read Andy Weir's *The Martian*.  It's very hard science fiction, but it's a hell of a fun ride.

Then you can start looking at Asimov and Heinlein and Simmons to check out their ideas. Asimov's and Heinlein's writing is quite dated these days, which might be jarring.

It's not Ingress with a Pokeskin though.  It's much, much simpler than that.  But Niantic release their stuff way before it's ready for general consumption and gradually develop it while letting the general public be their beta testers.  It worked well with Ingress because people expected that, but Pokemon fans expected a Pokemon release to be complete and polished because all previous Pokemon releases came from Nintendo and Nintendo refuse to release anything before it's perfect.

It's shallow, it's repetitive, there isn't really what you could describe as a story, but at least it triggers the dopamine receptors when you catch a new Pokemon, so there's that, which is nice.

559,"# I know OP said spoilers, but whoah, spoilers ahoy here.  Keep reading at your own peril.

I'll offer you a rationalization for the time manipulation too: time doesn't travel at the same speed in all universes.  This is something you merely have to accept as one of the axioms that's posited in the story of the game.  In some universes, progress has moved faster than others.  Which is why Elizabeth opens up a tear to the early 1980s in the intro segment to BioShock Infinite.  It's also why Albert Fink can stumble across tears into, say, the 1960s (""God Only Knows"") or the 1980s (""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"", ""Shiny Happy People"").  If you accept that time doesn't necessarily travel at the same speed in all universes, it makes sense that a tear from 1912 Columbia might reveal events from the 1980s in another universe.

It's also what enables Elizabeth to pull Booker into a 1980s universe where Columbia launches a full-on attack on New York City, only to send him back to 1912 to prevent that from happening in the first place.",2016-07-27 15:34:31+00:00,d5t2883,3.0,t1_d5t1u4g,491.0,Bioshock

561,"You're overthinking things.  But I'll offer an explanation anyway.

But when Elizabeth left the end of her pinky in Booker's universe, it was still *living* tissue, unlike hair or fingernail clippings which are dead.  For the brief time that it survived, it was still capable of sending nerve impulses on up to her brain, even though her brain was by that point in another universe.  As part of her nervous system, it was part of her consciousness.

She left a tiny bit of her consciousness behind in the other universe, which gave her a cross-universe consciousness (however briefly that lasted: I expect her fingertip died very quickly after being separated from the rest of her), and that eventually manifested as her ability to open up tears between possible universes.

Of course it's bullshit.  I know that, you know that.  But it's the classic scifi trope: make an assumption and follow it to its logical end.  The assumption in BioShock Infinite is that it's possible to cross universes, and the abstract concept of conception can travel across universes.  It's the sort of idea that I expect, for example, Peter Watts (/u/the-squidnapper just to tag him) might be able to have a bit of fun with.

Go see a doctor, and he'll probably refer you to a dermatologist, and the dermatologist will prescribe you a kind of antibiotic called tetracyclanes which have the useful property that they tend to collect in fatty tissue such as that which is just beneath your skin, resulting in the bacteria causing your infections to get killed off.

Boys of Silence are basically the cameras from BioShock 1 and 2 (right down to the alarm sound effect).  The only difference is that instead of just scanning back and forth, their scanning pattern is more random.  But once they start scanning in any direction, they're committed to the scan, which is your chance to sneak past them.

I think it also helps that after a few playthroughs of BioShock Infinite, I amused myself by figuring out which battles are optional, and trying to avoid them as much as possible.

598,"&gt; Q: Is the 30 km/hr limit on these bikes regularly enforced outside cities?  
&gt; A: Yes. Everywhere. I don't care though. I never limit my speed to 30. Been ticketed once in two decades. One point. meh.

Your answer contradicts itself.

Speed limits are pretty much universally ignored in Japan.  I've also received a single speeding ticket, and that was at a speed trap where I happened to be tailing a taxi.  The taxi was going at the 50km/h speed limit on Yamate-dori, and I was right behind him, and the cop with the radar gun saw the 50km/h reading from the big slab o' taxi, saw me on my little 50cc scooter behind the taxi, pulled me over, and ticketed me for 20km/h over the limit.  The only thing I could offer in my defence was that it was a nice day and traffic was especially light that day.  The cop acknowledged that, and ticketed me anyway (and told me to be more careful in future).

Other than that, I've pretty much ignored the speed limit, just like everyone else.

I also enjoy riding on roads where the speed limit has been deleted altogether, like Route 298 under the Gaikan.  It used to have a 50km/h speed limit, now it doesn't have a speed limit at all.  The police just trust everyone to go at an appropriate speed, and since Japanese drivers are generally very safe, everyone generally goes at between 80-100km/h when traffic is light, and between 40-60km/h when traffic is heavy.",2016-07-16 12:11:43+00:00,d5egl0g,3.0,t1_d5efh7l,4000.0,RideitJapan

640,"&gt; Science journalism is hard.

It's *spectacularly* hard.  You need to be smart enough to understand the science involved in the first place.  Ideally, you need to be smart enough to explain it in simple enough terms that nonscientists will understand.  George Gamow was one of those people (his book ""1, 2, 3...Infinity"" is a classic).  Stephen W. Hawking was another.  There are very few others.

Science journalists aren't intellectual giants like Hawking and Gamow, though.  They're just people like you and me.  For the most part, science journalists try to get enough information out of scientists so that they can get their thoughts un-fuzzy enough to the point that they can write down whatever they understand of what the scientists have been working on, before the deadline for publishing articles about whatever insight the scientists have had is passed (that deadline being, generally, before other science journalists have come up with enough insight to write an article).

650,"""Toasty"" was only the name of the model, and was only revealed to people who were curious enough to investigate the internals of the game itself.  It was never a name which was published to the world at large.  So for that, at least, we should give the developers at least half of a break.

If they'd named the model after the actual person who suffered from the face transplant that didn't go well, that might have been a bit of a tribute.  But since they were going from public-domain photographs documenting medical procedures, it's reasonable to assume that the photographs themselves were anonymized to begin with, so all the developers had was a narrative of someone who had been burned badly, and a surgeon who tried to save them by giving them a full-face graft.  There wasn't enough information for the developers to work with, so all they could come up with was the code name ""toasty"", and that's how the model ended up being named.

Long story short: put down your pitchforks, the developers had no more information than you did.  It took a historian to figure out the full story, because that's what historians do.  None of the BioShock developers were historians, and they just had limited information to work with.",2016-07-03 12:58:21+00:00,d4xlzkh,2.0,t1_d4wsrws,67904.0,Bioshock

She did nothing of the sort.  She just wrote the script.

The *director* cast a black girl to play Hermione.  Of all the people who auditioned for the part, the director thought the black girl was the best actor for the part, and casted her.  Rowling just agreed with that casting choice.

I missed that.  To be fair, I was more interested in the events than in the descriptions of the characters, but to also be fair, JK Rowling does describe her characters in considerable detail so I might not have been paying attention.

I loved the movie casting of a Scottish girl to play Cho Chang.  Apart from the character's name, nothing was said about where the character was from, so when I saw the movie and she had a thick Edinburgh accent, I was absolutely delighted: Rowling never mentioned the first thing about how she talked, and having her be Scottish was an excellent surprise.",2016-06-11 13:13:22+00:00,d44tzf2,3.0,t1_d44t8ym,2017.0,TumblrInAction

Chris Evans is a radio DJ, so he's used to ad-libbing everything, and working from a script is uncomfortable and strange for him.  That's easy to see from his too-gung-ho delivery of his lines.

I'm interested in your disclaimer about infinities though.  If your ring works with finite polynomials, can you still make it work with infinite polynomials?  Does the ring break down then or what?",2016-05-22 13:47:34+00:00,d3f5xci,8.0,t1_d3e6lcn,79839.0,askscience

A ring is a set which has two operations defined, right?  Addition and multiplication.  Subtraction is just addition with a negative sign thrown in.  Division complicates things because it yields results which are outside of the set, but you can mitigate that by allowing for remainders, so 5/3 is perfectly fine because it yields a pair of values: 1 and the remainder 2.

But sqrt(5) is clearly not a part of that ring.  It has no business being part of this discussion at all.  It's an impostor.

Which is why arcade games started out costing ¥100 per play in Japan and 25¢ per play in the late 1970s--back then, the two quantities were roughly equivalent.  Then the 1980s happened, the yen became massively-powerful (relatively-speaking), and then when the bubble burst, the people of Japan forgot that inflation is a normal part of life in most of the world.  Which is why a CD still costs ¥3000--the price of a piece of prerecorded media was set in the 1970s and never changed.

Nobody's going to focus on their own security.  That goes contrary to the business model!

898,"&gt; the concept of multiple endings make the game bad

I didn't say that.  You're putting words in my mouth there.

I said I prefer that the story be Ken Levine's, while the gameplay is mine, which is his design anyway.

Every time you play through a BioShock game--be it Infinite with its single ending or 2 with its 6 different endings--the actual gameplay itself will be different.  Perhaps you'll play through Infinite only using the pistol and machine gun.  Perhaps you'll play through the game purely using melee attacks.  Or perhaps you'll go out of your way to use every single weapon and plasmid/vigor in as diverse a way as possible.  But I guarantee you, even with BioShock Infinite, you'll play the game in a different way from the last time you played it.

That's what Ken Levine's concept of choice is all about.  The story is the constant: the variable is how you choose to enact the story.  Tacking on multiple endings is the publisher's idea, and the multiple endings don't have any significant bearing on either the game or the story.  They're just the coda for the story which is already over by the time you get to the ending scene.

I'm not so sure about that.  The only time you got to make decisions about anyone's fate was when you chose whether to save or harvest Little Sisters.  You certainly weren't given the choice about either sparing splicers or murdering them: the only possible choice was to murder splicers.

The only time you were actually given a choice as to the fate of the enemies was in Burial At Sea part 2, where you could complete the entire DLC without killing anyone at all.  That was a much more satisfying decision to make, really.

921,"&gt; They're saying ""I can't switch because I use twisted"", and your reply is, ""well, twisted sucks.""

Not really.  I'm just saying that it's a really complicated library, and fundamental changes in the language it's written in make it really difficult to simply edit the code to make it compatible with the new language which is still called ""Python"".  You added the value judgment yourself, and I didn't say that at all.

There are massive codebases out there which depend on FORTRAN 66 or 77, to pick a completely different language (LINPACK comes right to mind).  The code isn't any less valid because nobody's bothered porting it to the latest standard.  It's just that porting it to the new standard involves an investment of effort that could be better spent elsewhere.  Your daily weather forecast probably still requires code written in FORTRAN 77.

So if you're a Twisted user and that's the reason you still haven't switched to Python 3, you have my sympathies and I understand exactly the sort of pain you're going through.

In my place of work, we have to support stuff written in PHP 5.2, which is absolutely obsolete, but we also have to support stuff written in PHP 7.0, which is so different that I had to use a different version of gcc to compile the PHP interpreter.  I'm familiar with different versions of languages themselves; taking care of that is just a fact of life for me.

932,"Tokyo here.  Tokyoites really love tailgating.  I saw a guy on the motorway today who was following literally half a car length behind the car ahead, going at 100km/h (that's 60mph for the Americans out there).  I stayed well away from that situation.

If you like following at a safe distance, do it ahead of a truck.  Most truck drivers leave a huge gap in front of them because speeding up and slowing down a lot when you're in a truck is not only a huge pain, but it wastes money.  Truck drivers like to stay at a steady speed so they don't have to shift through all 27 gears all the time, so they use a great big gap in front of them as a buffer.  If a bike happens to be in that gap, doing the same thing as them, they don't mind.

As a bonus, traffic behind them runs smoother too, and nobody sees the huge gap because there's a truck in the way.  Try to do that on a motorcycle and impatient people will move heaven and earth to go roaring past--I had one guy just recently duck into the exit lane and back out of it before it actually exited, just so he could get past me.

Another bonus of riding in Tokyo, though, is that lane-splitting is completely legal.  I nearly never lane-split when traffic is actually moving, but when it's completely stopped (which happens all the time), I have no problems strolling between the cars, and only one person has ever given me any grief for it.",2016-04-30 11:17:03+00:00,d2n7opo,3.0,t1_d2n1w9k,21288.0,motorcycles

If you just put it aside and see what the real issue is, you'll make progress. But if you let the mental block be a mental block, it just limits your options.

Sex, or trans-ness, or handicap or whatever else you can think of, are just artificial mental blocks.  None of that matters.  The major business at hand is literally the major business at hand.

One of the main points of manners that I have regarding trans people is that you call them what they are, not what they used to be.  If someone used to be a man, but is now a woman, you treat them as a woman if and only if it's even relevant.

That doesn't mean all of the whole patronizing ""let me open that jar for you"" bullshit, either.  Women can do all of the same things that men can, up to the limits of their physical abilities, which is 99.975% of the time completely irrelevant.  Women are just as good at programming computers as men, just to pick an example from my own field of expertise.

But if someone used to be a man and is now a woman, or if someone used to be a woman and is now a man, it's just basic manners to treat them how they identify as now.  And if some third party outs them to you, you laugh and say ""that's some interesting gossip"", and you disregard it until they tell you themselves about their history, if they ever bother doing so (and they have absolutely zero obligation to do so).  If they don't, you don't even think of it.

It's just common courtesy.

The whole point of the scene is that Yuna suggests that Tidus should learn to laugh even when he's full of angst and feeling sad. Tidus does this absolutely ridiculous cardboard laugh, and Yuna tries to stop him, but he persists anyway and she joins in, and then--and this is where the voice actors really show their talent--they realize how completely ridiculous they're being and break out into honest laughter.

The contrast between the horrible fake laugh and the genuine laughter right afterwards is where the voice actors' skills shine.

You mentioned punch cards, and correctly pointed out that they were 80 columns wide, but the bit you didn't know about was that the last 8 columns were used for the sequence number.  This was important because if you dropped your deck of cards, thereby shuffling them, you could still use the sequence number and an automatic card sorter, to restore the original order.

Which is why even in 2016, everyone is exhorted to keep their code at most 72 columns wide.

Your 1hr 59minute ride as calculated by Google is extremely optimistic.  Also, you'll be blasting out to Hakone and then blasting right back.  What a waste, to spend all of that time just roaring past some of the most beautiful scenery in the country on boring motorways.

So, get the 8-hour rental.  Head out good and early--all of the traffic goes *into* Tokyo in the morning, so the congestion will all be in the other lanes.  Once you get there, get the hell off the motorway which I guarantee you'll be completely bored with by then, and spend some times in the wonderful twisty roads up and down the mountain.  Have a dip in an onsen if that's your thing, take a ride on the cable car if you like, and chill for a while.

1070,"Everyone here is just suggesting random products, all of which use symmetric encryption.  The problem with symmetric encryption is that if the password is compromised, the data is compromised.  But you asked for the *best* way to encrypt the data on the hard disk.

So here's the best way: asymmetric encryption.  Set up something like GPG on both of your ends.  Your client sets up a private key and public key combo, and sends you the public key, and keeps the private key strictly at their place.  No need to worry about sending the key via ""secure email"" at all.  You roll up all of the data into an archive and then use GPG to encrypt that using their public key.  There, you now have a bunch of data which nobody can unlock but them.  Not even you can unlock it.

Once they receive the data, they can unlock it using their private key, but in transit, nobody has a chance of spying on it.

There.  That's the best way.  It's not the easiest way, it's not the simplest way, and it's certainly not a user-friendly way.  But it is the best way.

I don't know if there are any asymmetric full-disk encryption schemes, because full-disk encryption schemes rely on the creator of the encrypted dataset being able to decrypt it too, so that it can be used as a filesystem.",2016-04-05 11:36:02+00:00,d1qjwya,1.0,t3_4dcahz,62946.0,sysadmin

And the Vespa name.

Edit: I had a phone call with my mechanic in between posting that snarky comment and now.  My mechanic pointed out another reason why you'd want to have a genuine Piaggio proper Italian scooter: /r/iamveryrich.  The work that needs to be done to my poor neglected (apparently) Scarabeo to restore it to proper roadworthiness would easily pay for me to get two lesser scooters.  Part of that is the mandatory inspection required here, but the much greater part of it is the fact that it needs new tyres, brakes, drive belt, radiator fluid, brake fluid, and oil.  The biggest part of that being tyres, and the second-biggest part of that being the brake overhaul kit, which has to be ordered specially from Italy and will arrive...whenever.  So I'm short a scooter for a month or so while exotic parts from exotic lands make their way to my shores.  But at least I can claim that I have a fancy Italian scooter!  And no money.  Because I've spent it all mending my scooter.

&gt; Reading their posts, one would think that the world consists of a Pangea-like continent dominated by the United States (which is the only remaining dictatorship), with the other 5% of the world's population confined to a few tiny islands and peninsulas around this supercontinent. They are barely aware of the three European nations - England, the Ruritanian Federation, and the People's Republic of Scandinavia (which is the greatest country on Earth).

&gt; Asia consists of Iraq, Afghanistan, and some other countries too small to consider and which are occupied by the United States. Israel is, of course, the 50th state (approximately - it's unclear how many stars have made their way onto the flag).
&gt; 
&gt; Africa is a very poor country somewhere far away. It was owned by England until about 20 years ago, when the English were driven out by the great African heroes Idi Amin and Robert Mugabe.

So if all the traffic around you is stopped because you're in a traffic jam, the safest way to proceed is to lane-split.  You're not contributing to traffic any more (because you're not part of the jam), and you can't get sideswiped by other cars because since they're not going forward, they can't change lanes either.

Therefore, lane-splitting in stopped traffic is completely safe.

It's the guys on sports bikes who go roaring between smoothly-moving lanes at a hundred miles an hour which gives lane-splitting a bad name.

Then I came to the end of the bag of beans, and didn't have enough left over for another cup, so I just upended the entire contents of the bag into my grinder.

The results were absolutely fantastic.  I got a nice, rich cup of coffee just by putting about a cup and a half's worth of beans into my grinder.  Which tells me that my idea of ""a cup worth of beans"" was completely wrong to begin with, and I should have been more generous all along.

Aeropress coffee benefits hugely from using a generous quantity of grounds, and as long as you have enough coffee there, it's very forgiving.  It waters down really smoothly to make a very nice Americano, too.

After the earthquake ended, the building was still wobbling back and forth, because that's what earthquake-resistant buildings do.  Before the wobbling had had a chance to even settle down, the first (big) aftershock came roaring by.  Shortly after that, everyone was ordered out of the building and sent home.

I bought my Scarabeo 400ie specifically so that I'd have a scooter I could take on the freeway.  Granted, it has a huge engine compared to the People 150, but the main thing it has in common with the People is its great big wheels (oh, and the seriously pretty styling).  Big wheels are a huge boon for riding in general.

Like you say, 150cc is basically a minimum for freeway driving (it's freeway-legal here in Japan, but you should probably stay clear of the fast lane).

You recommend a big heavy modular helmet, and I used to be a big fan of those (one protected my head perfectly well in an accident I was in), but recently I've come to like Stealth's Transformer helmets too--they have a vast visor so you can see everything going on around you, but they're still a full-face helmet (so long as you keep the chin-guard installed) so if worst comes to worst, you won't lose face in an accident.  Being able to see what's going on around you is as much of a safety feature as surrounding your head with protective hardware, and a helmet which pulls off both is an impressive feat of engineering.",2016-03-10 13:37:13+00:00,d0unpet,6.0,t1_d0u1vj5,48916.0,scooters
1246,"Personally I think that being fractured and out of touch is what lends Valve so much of its charm. It's a whole bunch of people who just work on whatever they feel like working on at the time.  Some people wanted to work on an online game store, and thus Steam was born. Some people wanted to work on hardware instead of software, and thus the Steam Controller and the hardware spec came about.  Some others thought that being stuck with Windows wasn't a useful way toward the future, hence Steam games are now available on multiple platforms.

The company is a chaotic mess of people who all have their own ideas, and by corporate policy, they're all encouraged to follow those ideas.  It's made them billions and billions of dollars, so it can't be the worst way to run a company.

I say Valve should keep doing their own thing.  It works spectacularly well for them, and anything they do which doesn't work, doesn't necessarily spell doom for the company.  It's just a mistake which they seem to have an impressive ability to learn from, and they move on and do something different.  Often, wildly different.

I'm a professional sysadmin.  I appreciate something with an easy installer, but you learn so much more about how computers work from the hacker distros than from the user-friendly ones.

In another comment, I mentioned OmniOS. We use that at my place of work.  It's an amazingly sysadmin-friendly OS, in that installing it involves telling the machine you're installing it on what kind of keyboard it has, picking your local time zone and which disk you want to put it on, and then five minutes later it's done.

Which is to say, you've arrived at who you are via a pretty straightforward, if maybe complicated, path (you're not the gender you were born with, and you wish to proceed with the gender you actually feel you are, which is completely reasonable).

But the Tumblr path is to embrace the actual transition itself as also being part of the identity.  If you were born a girl and feel that you're actually a man, it's not enough to just embrace your male identity; you also have to embrace the whole transition as being part of who you are.

But here's where the massive Tumblr contradiction comes into play: you not only have to accept that you were once one thing but are now another, but you have to loudly reject your former identity in favor of your current identity.  It's not enough to just discard your old identity and embrace your new one: you have to simultaneously reject your old identity and accept your new identity, in order to properly identify as ""trans"".

It's literally a Catch-22. You can't be either one thing or another: you have to be both, and loudly hate one aspect of yourself in order to accept the other aspect.

A physiotherapist's job is to hurt their patient (within reason) because if there isn't some level of pain, it's unlikely that he's actually doing anything to help.

At one point he had one of his interns work on me for practise, and the intern was really gentle with me.  So I said, ""This is really comfortable, it doesn't hurt at all.""

The fact that there are two octave keys makes sense because when you want to do the higher-octave versions of higher notes, you need the octave hole to be higher up the bore of the instrument.  It's not like the flute where if you want to play an octave higher, you have to hold your lips in a different way, and the best way to figure that out is to learn how to whistle an octave higher than usual.

Another instrument I never got the hang of was the clarinet.  It has a straight bore, which means that the register key adjusts the pitch by an octave and a half rather than just an octave.",2016-02-17 11:37:26+00:00,d032yp9,6.0,t1_d01wiq7,75614.0,iamverysmart

I get that one valve is a single semitone, another valve is two semitones and the other valve is (for some reason) three semitones.  That makes a kind of sense.  It's just the arrangement of the valves that threw me off.

One of the most fun things I did as a teenager was being recruited by the police to re-enact a carjacking scenario for CrimeStoppers, wherein I got to use a baseball bat to break a side window of a car, then smash the windscreen (re-enacting two different crimes).

It turns out that it's the easiest thing in the world to smash the side window of a car.  All you need to do is chuck some elbow grease into it, and make it look spectacular.

It turns out, also, that smashing a windscreen takes a significant expenditure of effort.  Those things won't even start to yield to an enthusiastically-wielded baseball bat--it just bounces off.  To make a significant hole in a windscreen turned out to involve using the baseball bat as a kind of battering ram instead of just taking a good swing at it.

There's a really steep hill by my place of work (like, 40% grade level of steep).  When I had a 50cc scooter, it was great, because the scooter was absolutely fine as long as you could keep the engine within the power band.  And you're probably aware that the power band of a 2-stroke engine is right at the top of the rev range.

Due to being a sudden really steep hill, it was really easy to get the scooter's engine, bless its little heart, to fall out of its power band.  And when that happened, the scooter just kept slowing down and slowing down.  I usually made it all the way to the top of the hill before it completely gave up the ghost, but it was often pretty dicey.  Once or twice I had to hop off and give it a bit of a push.

4-stroke engines have a much broader power band though.  That's where the torque I mentioned comes in.  They might not be as fast going up a super-steep hill like that, but at least they'll make it.

My point was just that if you're in San Francisco, you should probably go for a four-stroke.  It might not be quick, but at least it'll get all the way up the hills there.  If you're in Minot, North Dakota, though, where everything is completely flat, you may as well get a two-stroke, because you'll be able to roar around at top speed without anything getting in your way.",2016-01-29 14:11:14+00:00,czgdb3m,6.0,t1_czfhals,66484.0,scooters

A two-stroke engine is awful at dealing with hills, due to the lack of torque meaning you have to redline the thing to get any power.  If you have a four-stroke engine, it's way more grunty at low revs, and infinitely more capable of climbing hills.

That's part of the reason why the Honda Super Cub always had a four-stroke engine: it doesn't need to go fast, but it does need to be able to climb the steep hills you find in rural Japanese towns.

If you're in North Dakota where the entire state has been carefully ironed flat, a two-stroke is probably fine.  If you're in San Francisco, on the other hand, you'll probably do better with a four-stroke.

1478,"Impostor syndrome is totally a thing.  Normally it shows up in your professional life, but it can also show up in your personal life too.

I can't offer any solid advice, so all I can do is say you should play it by ear.  He seems to care a lot about you, so gently let him know about your vulnerabilities.  If he's the decent guy you paint him as being, he'll take all of that into account, and as a result he'll know you better and treat you even better than he does too.

Here's where I put the lie to where I said I can't offer any solid advice, but be aware that what I'm offering here is seriously *vague* advice.  Buyer beware.

Seriously: admit to him that you've seriously considered manipulating him.  Fore-warned is fore-armed.  If you actually end up doing so unconsciously (you will, trust me), at least he'll be able to see what you're doing, and react accordingly.  Whether that be calling you on it, or rolling with it and changing his own actions as a result is up to him, but at least you've explicitly told him it's a possibility.

Sure you're emotionally fucked up.  I'll let you into a little secret: all of us are.  If you trust him with your strength, also trust him with your weakness.

I have a wonderful girlfriend who I recently hurt just to prove a hypothesis to myself.  I did what she told me to do, and it turned out to hurt her quite badly.  I felt absolutely terrible when I realised what had actually happened.

What I learned was that she's not always honest with herself, and she'll cheerfully tell herself that she's okay with me doing things that I vaguely want to do, even at the expense of hurting herself.  I learned to not always trust her advice when she wants the opposite of what I ask her to happen, and she learned that she's way too unselfish and doesn't give her honest opinion because she figures it would be selfish to do so.  This is a communication gulf that I'm still working on building a bridge over.

Sometimes you have to give your selfish opinion.  If your boyfriend is as sensible as you paint him as being, you need do no more than simply qualify your opinion as being selfish before telling him what it is, and he'll be smart enough to consider your biases as well as his own before proceeding.",2016-01-27 13:42:07+00:00,czdsv61,1.0,t3_42txfz,57170.0,TrueOffMyChest

I have a W800.  I needed to replace the battery.  That's a pretty simple part to replace on most bikes, but apparently the W800 was made by comedians.

In order to get the battery out, you have to remove the entire fuse box and the air filter, and both of those are carefully nestled behind the panel on the left-hand side of the bike, which is a significant break with tradition in that most motorcycles hide the battery behind the right-hand-side panel, and certainly not behind the lungs and nerve center of the bike. Just imagine my confusion when I popped the right-hand-side panel off and discovered…nothing.  And then when I finally went on the Internet to find out how to do it, all I could find was a YouTube video of a scan through a document in German, which featured way more exclamation marks than I'd expect anything written by a German person to have.

And I had to cut so many zip ties too while I was at it.

Oh, and then I made a mistake putting the battery cover panel back in place, accidentally pushed the nut which was held in place with a rubber grommit through, and had to remove the entire rear bumper (and unwire all of the lights) just to retrieve the nut.

1579,"You seem to be confused about the concept of a ""continuum"".  There is certainly a continuum between what you think a ""scooter"" is and what you think a ""motorcycle"" is.

A Honda Super Cub has several scooter-like characteristics.  It has a small engine, it has lots of fairing to protect you from the elements, and it's used more as a utility machine than a fun machine.  Also, discussion of Honda Super Cubs is explicitly welcome here, because as a moderator of /r/scooters, I absolutely welcome said discussion.

And sure, the Aprilia Mana 850 is pretty clearly a motorcycle while still having the CVT from a scooter (and the engine from a Gilera GP800, which while being an underbone, nobody will ever deny that it's a scooter).  So where does, say, the Honda DN-01 fit in?  It has flat boards to put your feet on and an automatic transmission, but you have to step over it to get onto it.

And, well, I'm pretty sure you're thinking about the classic Vespa PX200 which has a manual-shift transmission where you twiddle the left handlebar to shift gears and you're willing to argue that it's undeniably a scooter, but where exactly do you actually think the Giorcub fits in?  It has scooter-like fairing, running boards and all, but you still shift gears by manipulating a lever with your left foot, which quite definitely isn't allowed to sit on the running boards.

A scooter is whatever whoever's talking about it thinks is a scooter.  A Suzuki K50 can be a scooter.  It's certainly not a moped, but it falls a bit short of being a Manly Man's Motorcycle all the same.

Heck, a Harley-Davidson Street Glide almost counts as a scooter by your parameters: it totally has flat platforms for the rider's feet.   It only misses out by not being a step-through.  A Super Cub is a step-through design, though, even though you put your feet on pegs.  If someone modifies a Ruckus to have footpegs instead of running boards, does it suddenly cease being a scooter?",2016-01-04 11:57:06+00:00,cylfnfm,7.0,t1_cykni7f,57541.0,scooters

1659,"Well, as you are currently suspecting, a drive belt replacement might be the simplest fix.  If the previous owner treated the throttle like a binary control, and just hammered it all the time, that would cause some uneven wear on the drive belt.  In a stroke of good luck for you, though, a drive belt is a relatively cheap part, and while it is slightly annoying to replace yourself, it's not very difficult.

It's less likely to be the spark plug, but those are also easy to replace, and quite cheap too.  When you find it (this might be easier said than done, but that's up to you to find out), have a look at it.  If it seems to have lots of carbon on it, or if it seems to be a bit burned out (look for a notch in the metal bit on the top of the spark plug) that could also indicate problem.  Since spark plugs are cheap and easy to replace, you could take care of that without much trouble.

I have no idea how handy you are with mechanical things, though, but even for a complete tyro, both replacing the drive belt and replacing the spark plug are pretty straightforward things.

A 2007 bike is already eight years old, though.  There is a chance that the clutch rollers might have gotten squared off over the years.

1707,"&gt; Whatever the person who claims to be triggered says is a trigger.
&gt; That's the problem.

It's a riff on people who suffer from PTSD caused by being in, say, warzones where, for example, their friend got killed by a landmine.

When you're dealing with actual PTSD, a trigger is an unpredictable thing.  It could be something as simple as loud noises. It could be an enclosed space, like an elevator where the doors don't open quickly enough.  It could just be the beep of a text message arriving--that text message being the trigger for the bomb that killed the sufferer's friend.

The modern coddled-infant version of that is that any mention of anything even vaguely related to what actually happened immediately recalls the entire trauma, so you should step on eggshells around them.  All of the responsibility for avoiding the trauma is on everyone else around them, not upon the sufferer themselves.

Anorexia survivors are also prone to being triggered, but just like the soldiers, it won't necessarily be in a way that you'd normally expect.  It's not like saying ""a healthy diet consists of a balance of carbohydrates, protein and vitamins"" will set them off just because you said ""diet"", for example.  But if you say the word ""count"", regardless of context, even outside the context of counting calories, that could just as much trigger them.",2015-12-03 12:55:36+00:00,cxlla2t,5.0,t1_cxlh2km,16423.0,japan

1734,"This is where you sort of have to go back to the basics, and think about how *good* code works.

If you start with a small function that only has local variables, which takes known input and returns known output, along with known error conditions when input is somehow invalid, you can completely test it and say that it all works correctly.  Once you've done this, you can then treat it as a basic unit.

Then you can use that well-tested basic unit along with other well-tested basic units, to compose other functions.  Since you know none of your functions are going to be doing anything to interrupt with the operation of any of the other functions, it's sufficient to test each function you make individually, and be able to say ""yes, I know that this works correctly"".

When you have a global variable shared between two functions, you have to test the two functions which share the global variable as if they were a single complex function, because they both interact with each other through the shared global variable.

When you have hundreds or thousands of global variables, all of them being modified by potentially hundreds or thousands of functions each, you literally can't say at any time what the value of any particular global variable might be.  Maybe a global variable is only referenced by a single function--but in that case, it should be declared as ""static"" as a local within the function, or used as a singleton, or whatever tools your programming language provides you to handle that situation.",2015-11-30 08:35:28+00:00,cxhqtms,4.0,t1_cxhko1t,15115.0,programming

1781,"&gt; True, but 'half of all members of the cabinet MUST be female and the other half MUST be male' is something that to me sounds like it will make it less likely that the truly most qualified person for the job is selected.

Fair enough, but the Harper Government's standard was just that any Cabinet member would just agree with whatever Harper said, with diversity in geography being a distant second.

Exhaustive enforcement of strict equality of gender is merely an arbitrary, irrelevant criterion.  It doesn't actually affect anything because there are enough people in various fields that you can find people meeting your arbitrary criteria anyway.

When the fields are broad enough, as they have to be for cabinet appointees, chucking in a gender-equality requirement doesn't actually affect the field that much.  It does affect the field from a political standpoint, though, and since Trudeau is a politician, that's the primary criterion as far as he's concerned.

Given the criteria being ""you have to agree with me no matter what"" versus ""you have to have some arbitrary characteristics and also have some qualifications for the job besides"", I'll go with Trudeau's criteria any day.  I didn't vote for him, and I didn't want him to get the job, but now he has the job, and so far I'm a fan of his selection of wiser advisors.

Sikhs are slightly overrepresented, but I'll allow Trudeau that minor error in strict equality.",2015-11-18 12:34:45+00:00,cx4fhqp,5.0,t1_cx38sxl,82532.0,KotakuInAction

And then he added another arbitrary criterion: each cabinet minister should be actually qualified for the job.

The cabinet he chose is pretty good, considering.  The Minister of Health is a doctor.  The Minister of Transport is Canada's first man in space.  The Minister of National Defense is a military hero.

1832,"It's a gaming site with a Christian bias.  They make their bias clear right from the get-go.  They actively declare their bias, right from the name of the site.

That said, when they review a game, they start by setting their explicit bias aside, and consider the game without any biases.  Once they've done that, they turn their biases back on and review the game again with their biases fully operational.  The thing that's great about them is the the fact that they do just that, and they're fully aware of what they're doing.  The unbiased review is explicitly decoupled from the biased review, and they mark both reviews explicitly.

The biased review can be viewed as a sort of parents' guide: should your small child play GTAV?  Probably not.  Would your small child benefit from the moral lessons in BioShock?  Unlikely: they don't have the mental critical framework in place to be able to comprehend the sarcastic messages that game delivers.

The unbiased review just talks about how good a game the actual game is.  Is there a good selection of puzzles?  Does it challenge your mind?  Does it make you think hard, or just chuck rewards at you?

I like that approach to video game criticism.  It's not unbiased, but at least it doesn't try to hide its biases.  I honestly don't mind biased coverage, if the writer with the bias professes their bias and admits that they're providing a biased view.  That gives the reader a fair chance to calibrate their reading of the review.

1954,"A big 1300cc cruiser engine has basically infinite torque even at low revs.  That's a good thing!  But if you're just learning, it's a terrible thing.

It's a terrible thing because it's damn-near impossible to stall an engine like that.  Pop the clutch at the wrong time and instead of the engine just stalling and you looking foolish, it's going to make a run for the hills and take you along with it.  Get that happening to you and the chances of whiskey-throttling it and making the problem even worse go through the roof.

Hell, my first ever crash was a result of me whiskey-throttling a 50cc two-stroke scooter.

Seriously, though, start with something small and gutless, not something with a tractor engine.  Learn how to control the machine and learn what the parts of it do and how they work together.  Then think about getting your dream bike.

Might I suggest a Suzuki TU250X?  No power, no torque, but such a happy little bike to ride, and it'll accommodate your learner fuckups by just dying and making you look a bit silly, rather than trying to take your head off.",2015-10-15 11:44:22+00:00,cw0iu3l,1.0,t3_3ou4r9,8673.0,motorcycles
1955,"&gt; Fuel injected scoots have no kick a poo

They could.  The major obstacle stopping that from happening is that for FI to be a thing, you actually need to have a computer booted up and running programs by the time the ignition is ready to start firing.  Late-model Honda Monkeys run it (with a tiny little battery whose only responsibility is booting up the computer--otherwise it runs entirely with electricity from the alternator).  Yamaha SR400s manage it too.  Both of those bikes have a mandatory kickstarter, though.

But for the vast majority of FI engines, the power needed to fire up the engine is well in excess of the power needed to fire up the computer that the engine uses to work.  You may as well require both, and have them be electric-start only.

Both of my bikes are FI engines, and neither of them have a kick starter.  Instead, I keep a battery charger and some jump cables handy in case either of them doesn't feel like starting.",2015-10-15 11:29:28+00:00,cw0ike9,5.0,t1_cvzyejw,47216.0,scooters

Where I am, you're not legally allowed to ride a 50cc scooter on roads which even *have* a breakdown lane.  Because those are the high-speed motorways, and 50cc scooters, being considered more bicycle than motorcycle, aren't capable of going there at all.

The engine size limit for going on motorways is ""more than 125cc"".  All of the 125cc scooters you find on the market are actually 124cc engines, just like how all of the 50cc scooters you find on the market are actually 49cc.  It's to comply with regulations about engine size.

To go on the motorway, you need something with an engine size of greater than 125cc.  A Honda PCX150 would be fine, and it can easily deal with 100km/h speed limits if you crank it wide open.  My Scarabeo 400ie can do that without any worries whatsoever.

I don't ride in the breakdown lane though.  Because there are broken-down cars there.  When traffic is all jammed up, I ride between the lanes.  It's just safer there.  People expect bikes to go between cars here, so that's a bit of driving culture you have to keep in mind.

When traffic is moving, I stick to my lane, because that's usually the sensible thing to do.  There was one occasion when I should have been lane-splitting and wasn't, and that cost me my first big scooter (I decided to go into the lane instead of lane-splitting: I was being tailgated by one idiot, and another idiot made an aggressive lane change, not seeing me there, sideswiped me, and at highway speeds, that was the end of the bike.

2007,"&gt; A scooter is a motorcycle, which is just a really narrow car. I don't care how small the engine, it's still a motorcycle. 

Now you might say that, but that actually depends on your local rules.

Here in Japan, a 50cc scooter is regarded by the law as being more bicycle than car, so the rules say it has to stay within the left one meter of the road (traffic goes on the left in Japan), and refrain from going any faster than 30km/h (widely ignored by scooter riders).  Car drivers treat scooters as being more bicycle than car, too.

OP is in Boston though, and I suspect that Boston rules favor scooters--even little 50cc scooters--being considered more car than bicycle.  I don't know about the driver culture in Boston, though, so I don't know if they follow the letter of the law or not.  From the lane-changing behaviour I've heard about, odds are they don't.

My own rule of thumb is that when traffic is moving, I'm a car and I follow car rules, but when traffic is stopped, I turn into a bicycle and follow bike rules.  But then again, lane splitting is totally legal here, and verboten in all of the USA except for California.

So my advice for OP is to spend some time paying attention to how other scooter riders ride, and what drivers actually expect you to do.  Once you have a good picture in your head of how to proceed, ride wisely.  And be careful out there!",2015-10-06 12:26:00+00:00,cvq01kr,2.0,t1_cvprfff,29812.0,scooters

Let's say we're going to make a competitor for the 5K Retina iMac for example.  The 5K Retina iMac costs $2500, so that's the budget we're working with.  If we decide to make a PC with those same specs, we may as well start with the display.

A 5K display from Dell is totally available, so we're off to a great start!  So let's get that.  Oops, that particular display costs $2500, so there's our budget gone right off the bat.  Building a PC that can drive all of that is just extra money we have to spend.

It turns out that for every machine that Apple makes, if you try to match it spec for spec, you'll end up spending more money than the equivalent Apple machine would set you back.

Sure you can make a cheaper machine than Apple makes--but it'll be a worse machine too.

When it comes to making a better machine than Apple does, I did recently build a home disk server which is better than anything Apple makes.  It has lots of hard disks, because Apple doesn't make a machine which takes lots of hard disks, for whatever reason there is out there which pleases them.  It runs Linux, and the filesystem store is ZFS, and all of that pleases me.  I don't think that an average person would even consider building a Frankenstein server like that though.

2139,"Well, any discrimination against a community of people based on stuff they have no control over (like their ancestors) is, in my book, ""mass discrimination"".

If someone breaks a bunch of your stuff, you probably won't want to ask him to do work for you in the future, and that's discrimination--but it's not mass discrimination.  It's very precise discrimination.

But if someone's grandparents just happened to work as leather workers, discriminating against them based just on that fact is in the realm of mass discrimination.  It's not fair, it doesn't take into account anything about them that they have any control over, and it's lumping them into a community of people you discriminate against based on nothing.  It's the very definition of prejudice.  And yet there are people who do things like deliberately avoid areas where those people used to live.

I once saw a photocopied poster on a utility pole for a seriously shady loan shark.  It said they would lend to you if you were a foreigner!  Or a freeter!  Or even a ブラク!  While I admire the loan shark's openmindedness (inasmuch as you can admire something that a complete slime does), I did get the impression that they were deliberately going after people they'd have extra leverage over if they failed to pay up.

Which is the bigger community in Japan, though: *n*th-generation Koreans who have grown up their entire lives speaking nothing but Japanese, and have participated in nothing but Japanese culture, but because of old laws, haven't been allowed to become Japanese citizens, or Japanese people who are considered Japanese, but are considered slightly less human because of the jobs their ancestors had?  I'm asking seriously here.  I think those communities are about the same size, but the net-uyoku types discriminate far more harshly against one than the other.",2015-09-07 10:29:53+00:00,cutbzib,9.0,t1_cutbt89,836.0,japanlife

2141,"&gt; If you really want to feel stupid, I suggest *City at the End of Time* by Greg Bear. I have no idea what was going on there at all...

I had the same reaction to reading *Embassytown* by China Miéville.  Fortunately I'd just read *Everything and More: A Compact History of Infinity* by David Foster Wallace, which amazingly enough covers many of the same themes that *Embassytown* does, only in a much more factual, much harder, much more difficult-to-get-your-head-around way.  It's incredibly dense, incredibly quick and incredibly intense, but when you finish reading it, you feel immeasurably smarter.  Then you want to go back and read it again to see if you get the ideas in it better the next time round.

Reading that book was pretty good preparation for reading *Embassytown*.  For reading *Blindsight*, though, I suggest Oliver Sacks's *The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat* as a nice, gentle warm-up for the real show.

Seriously, I crashed on mine, and even though I ended up spending a total of six weeks in hospital to take care of my injuries (I should've been paying more attention, and so should the guy in the car who ran over me), the bike sustained a total of, literally, ten dollars of damage: all it needed to make it as good as new was a replacement clutch lever.  The insurance company had trouble believing it.

Then see if you can get your hands on a Kawasaki W650 once you figure you know what you're doing.  It's bigger and ridiculously better, but otherwise--when it comes to ride position and whatnot--indistinguishable from the TU250X.

Maybe if you're really lucky, the W800 will be available for you by the time you get tired of your little Suzuki.  I have one and it's a truly fantastic bike.

A game engine uses a bunch of shortcuts instead.  Rendering engine developers have gotten extremely good over the years, but all of the cleverness they've come up with are, compared with ray-tracing, just cheating.  Every time someone thinks of making a game which uses real-time ray-tracing, the short-cut makers are a step ahead of them.

Game designers also go out of their way to avoid things that would be computationally-expensive.  You never see realistically-rendered disco balls in video games, because they're a massive collection of mirrors, and why would you blow your GPU's firepower just to render a decoration?  Even when you encounter a mirror in a typical video game these days, it's not a proper mirror--it's just another render of the same scene with the camera in a different location, superimposed on the main render.

For a parallel, just look at the Linux civil war about something called ""systemd"".

I live in Japan, btw.

&gt; which means that many more products are designed with white people in mind.

Yeah, I've not found this to be the case.

&gt; This is also true for the media. I can go to the movies or turn on the TV and be all but guaranteed to see white people in a starring role.

Did I mention I live in Japan?  I turn on the TV and I see a bunch of Japanese people nattering away in Japanese, which is not my native language, about issues which are important to Japanese people.  Occasionally there's a token white guy, or a token black guy, just to lend ""diversity"" to the discussion.

&gt; mainstream white culture

hehehehehe

Sorry, just wanted to get that out there.  ""Mainstream white culture"".

Anyway, moving on to the point you were trying to make:

&gt; This is also true for the media. I can go to the movies or turn on the TV and be all but guaranteed to see white people in a starring role. It's also very likely that the movie will make references to things that come from mainstream white culture, either popular or historical. The media will be catered to my taste and frame of reference as a white person.

Yeah, not so much the case for me.  I'll turn on the TV, see Japanese people talking about things which matter to them, filtered through a Japanese point of view, and taking Japanese culture into consideration.  If they ever talk about what you refer to as ""white"" culture (which is actually better described as ""middle-class American culture""), it'll be from the perspective of ""look at what those people over there think!  Isn't that interesting?""

The media here is catered to the tastes and frame of reference of a Japanese person.

&gt; In zero sum situations, white people benefit from the discrimination against other races. Let's say there's one job opening, and a black person and a white person are applying. The black person is as or more qualified than the white person, but the hiring manager is biased against black people.

Let's say there's a job opening and there are three candidates.  A white person named, to pick a name out of a hat, Dave Brown, a black person named DeWayne Jackson, and a Japanese person named Taro Yamada.

99 times out of a hundred, Taro Yamada will get the job.  Not because he's more qualified than Dave Brown or DeWayne Jackson, but because he's more likely to be able to mesh with the ""corporate culture"", which is to say he's a Japanese dude.  There will be any number of corporate-sounding excuses why Taro Yamada got the job, but when all is said and done, the reason he got the job is because his name is Taro Yamada, and that means he'll be a good little corporate slave.

I lucked into a job here in Tokyo where a certain amount of iconoclasm is actually appreciated.  My company actually goes out of their way to hire a certain number of foreign employees, just because the foreign employees tend to be more forthright when they have more interesting ideas than the Japanese employees.  Not being raised in a culture where the nail that sticks up gets hammered down is quite valuable from a commercial point of view.

But I don't delude myself.  I don't think I'm in a position to climb the corporate ladder.  Nobody's going to make me a manager, and I don't even want to be a manager.  But I'll keep coming up with cool new ideas, and they'll eventually, through a process of osmosis, be adopted.

But my white skin doesn't give me any privileges.  It's an active handicap.  I can take advantage of it when I can, but for the most part, I have to accept my lower-caste status and make of it whatever I can.",2015-08-24 12:04:16+00:00,cudsr7i,7.0,t1_cudg9ee,36569.0,TiADiscussion
2233,"Oh I like that distinction.  Will Shetterly advocated making a distinction between ""Social Justice Warrior"" and ""Social Justice Worker"", the latter being someone who actually works to improve the state of the world, rather than the former who just complains about it.

It's not the person who I want to say ""fuck off"" too, really.  It's the person who looks at all I've done in the name of equality, but the moment I espouse an idea which is remotely different from the popular doctrine--say, for example, ""men also have their own share of problems and we should help them to overcome them as much as we help women to overcome their problems""--immediately takes that and assumes that since I'm not 1000% on their side, I must be a staunch advocate of the exact opposite.  If you think that men have problems of their own, you must also be an enthusiastic supporter of pick-up artists, that sort of thing.

I have room in my mind for the concept of nuance.  I think that men and women are equal and that women have their problems.  I also think that men have their problems too, and everyone should work together to make things as arbitrary-obstacle-free as possible.

I also have this belief that all of the activist-feminist types out there screaming loudly about the horrors of sexism they have to encounter actually make things *worse* in general, not better: Women in the 1980s weren't told that, say, technology was a sexist nightmare, so they casually entered tech, were accepted on their own merits, and flourished.

2248,"I have a feeling that you're failing to distinguish between patent law, which protects inventions and guarantees inventors a limited right to claim royalties for their inventions, and *design* patent law, which is actually closer to copyright law than patent law.

Rounded rectangles is pretty clearly in the realm of design patents rather than just standard patents.

Design patents are a pretty fuzzy area of law, and all of the legal arguments that crop up around them are perfectly justified, in my opinion.  They are on the soft line between patents and copyrights, and any and all legal disputes that result from them just help to clarify what the line actually is.

Edit: I thought about it a bit more.  The field of design patents isn't an area where anyone has any clear claim to correctness.  It's more like a field of clearly-designated ambiguity.  It's a sort of legally-designated battleground.  Nobody is going to be unambiguously-right in this particular field, but it is a sort of game ground for all of the designers and their lawyers to have their fun defending their ideas.  It's kind of like a legal sports stadium.  Everything that everyone is arguing about is actually, in the long term, trivial, but at least they get to practise their arguing skills.  On that basis, I am wholly in support of the concept of design patents.  It keeps the lawyers entertained while distracting them from actually important issues.  If something is important enough for real legal attention, then the stars from the design-patent debates can ply their arguing skills there.",2015-08-18 15:01:24+00:00,cu731on,5.0,t1_cu7020z,5465.0,apple

2258,"Or alternatively, you could take a different point of view and posit a number system based on pi instead of, well, 10.  If you say that ""10"" is now the value of pi, all kinds of numbers that you used to think were rational now aren't any more: 3/5 has a decimal (er, pi-imal) representation that stretches on forever instead of being 0.6.

The fact of the matter is that irrational numbers are so much more common than rational numbers that you can actually prove mathematically that rational numbers don't exist: just consider the number of irrational numbers that could possibly ever exist, and by contrast consider the number of rational numbers that could possibly exist.  For every rational number you could think of, there are an infinite number of irrational numbers just based on that rational number you had in mind.  Since the result of dividing any number by infinity is 0, there are no rational numbers.

It's a silly result, sure, but that's what happens when you start thinking about different magnitudes of infinity.",2015-08-17 12:54:32+00:00,cu5tdve,4.0,t1_cu5lhho,28128.0,askscience

Another feature I like is its menu completion: bang on tab a few times and instead of just cycling through the list of completions, it brings up a visual menu which you can choose from.  I'm pretty sure bash has helped itself to that feature in the years since I first discovered it, but it's still pretty neat.

Yet another feature which I especially like is that when it expands a variable, it presents the expansion of the variable as a single object to whatever it's giving it to.  Which is to say, if your variable is a directory with a space in its name, it'll just expand the variable as a single parameter, space and all, rather than feeding it through the parser a second time and giving the parser the chance to split the parameter into two words and making a hash of your shell script.

2356,"Oh you are in luck!

Per /u/tokoyhoon's link, it's totally possible to transfer your license over without having to go to the bother of taking the test again.  This is a huge convenience.

Get a translation of your Taiwanese license from your local JAF office.  That's absolutely required, but the JAF office has exhaustive information about what every international license needs.  Also, get a copy of a document called the 住民票, pronounced ""juuminhyou"".  You get that from your ward office.  You also need to be able to prove that you had your driver's license for more than three months before moving to Japan--so bring your passport with you, to show the guys the stamps in it.

Once you have those documents, get to the driver's license center good and early!  Getting your driver's license--or even renewing it--is a full-day affair with lots of ceremony and pomp and whatnot, mainly due to the fact that one driver's license center handles vast numbers of people and it's easier to do it all in batch.

That said, pay attention to the posted schedule at your driver's license center and damn well stick to it.  Otherwise you'll just have to come back the next day with your paperwork to get it all processed.

I can't say for sure what license a 250cc Taiwanese license will get you: they might err on the side of caution and limit you to a kogata license, which would suck.  But things might go well and they might give you a *futsuu* license (it's not been chuugata for more than half a decade now, so you know how long tokyohoon has been around here for), which lets you ride up to 399cc bikes, which is plenty powerful enough for most purposes.

You'll want to stick with your 250cc bikes though.  Any engine displacement more than that, and your bike has to pass a pretty strict inspection every couple of years.  I don't mind that myself (I have a 400cc bike and an 800cc bike), but it can get pretty expensive.",2015-08-03 10:25:24+00:00,ctprevq,1.0,t3_3fl91w,16118.0,japanlife

2370,"Here's the build script for the ""joe"" text editor:

&gt; 　

There isn't one.  ""joe"" can be built with a standard GNU `configure --prefix=/usr; make; make install` sequence, and that's the default Lunar Linux build.  So since there isn't any more to it than that, a build script is completely unnecessary: the default Lunar build works just fine.

Lunar doesn't provide any pre-built packages at all apart from those which are on the install CD.  It has a default build script which works for a reasonable plurality of cases, and for those which don't support the default build, it lets you provide your own build.  Here's the one for binutils, for example:


    # Following the build procedure used by the LFS folks
    mkdir -p build-binutils &amp;&amp;
    cd build-binutils &amp;&amp;

    ../configure  --prefix=/usr    \
                  --disable-werror \
                  --enable-shared  \
                 $OPTS         &amp;&amp;

    make tooldir=/usr          &amp;&amp;
    prepare_install            &amp;&amp;
    make tooldir=/usr install  &amp;&amp;
    make tooldir=/usr install-info  &amp;&amp;
    mkdir -p $DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/binutils  &amp;&amp;
    cp -p ../binutils/NEWS ../binutils/ChangeLog $DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/binutils &amp;&amp;

    # For some reason installwatch fail to pick up the ld hardlink, touching it solves that issue
    if [ -e /usr/bin/ld ]; then
      touch /usr/bin/ld
    fi

It's a bit of a production, but it's been tested thoroughly by the Lunar developers, and is robust enough for production use.

For packages that can be built in many ways, the DEPENDS script generally handles most of those complications.  It makes it really easy to build a system that's customized exactly for your needs, and doesn't make it needlessly painful to do so (just look at how many different options you can find in, say, Debian, for installing a package with a combinatorial explosion of different optional features).",2015-07-30 13:10:08+00:00,ctlh4io,5.0,t1_ctlerqd,6287.0,linux

2428,"*Two* other servers?  Well, seems like you're pretty new to this.  I have nagios monitoring hundreds and hundreds of servers.

Nagios likes to split things up into eighty zillion different configuration files, but what it actually does is read your entire mess of configuration in as if it was just one enormous config file.

The documentation tells you that you should add an entry to a file called `checkcomands.cfg` but it doesn't matter, you can put it anywhere.  You should put it in `checkcommands.cfg` anyway, just for organization's sake.  Add a stanza which looks like this:

    define command {
        command_name check_mem
        command_line $USER1$/check_nrpe -H $HOSTADDRESS -c $ARG1$
    }

And then on the host itself, you ensure that `nrpe` is running, that being the main interface between nagios and the host, and that `nrpe.cfg` (you have to figure out the location of that yourself, it varies by installation) has a line which looks like this:

    command[check_mem]=/usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_mem

And that there is a script or binary in the path pointed to by that which actually checks the memory of the server.

Nagios is a very handy tool, but lordy is it ever fiddly to set up and get working properly.  I eventually resorted to machine-generating 99% of the nagios configuration at work, just because it was so much of a bother otherwise.",2015-07-21 11:59:24+00:00,ctas22p,1.0,t3_3e24sf,3176.0,sysadmin

&gt; Greenberg was widely regarded as a mentor to budding entrepreneurs and computer programmers, helping people get started in the tech industry through Grooveshark University classes, the Summer with the Sharks internship program and as a partner in the Founders Pad business incubator. He was a founding member of the Gainesville Area Chamber of Commerce’s Gainesville Technology Council.
&gt; 
&gt; Duncan Kabinu said Greenberg was working on another music-related mobile application and they spent Friday together working on the Gainesville Dev Academy, which launched this summer to offer training in computer programming. Kabinu said they wanted to expand on Greenberg’s Grooveshark University by offering it to the community so people could improve their skills and their lives.
&gt; 
&gt; “I think it was just in him to be that guy to help people out,” Kabuni said. “He was always available, as busy as he was, to take the time to mentor people.”
&gt; 
&gt; In a prior interview, Augi Lye, founder of the tech companies Trendy Entertainment and ToneRite, said Grooveshark helped put Gainesville on the map as a company known globally.
&gt; 
&gt; “I really don’t know anyone who has had more influence than Josh, everything from being a visionary for the amazing technology coming out and training the next generation of developers and entrepreneurs,” he said.
&gt; 
&gt; Greenberg started MaidSuite with Student Maid founder Kristen Hadeed to provide an online scheduling application for cleaning companies and other service providers.
&gt; 
&gt; Hadeed said they made a pinky promise four years ago to do something together.
&gt; 
&gt; “I’m just so glad we did because I learned so much from working with him as such a good friend and just so talented,” she said.
&gt; 
&gt; “I think he’s somebody that everybody looked up to. He inspired many people, even beyond his years. He will be missed beyond belief.”
&gt; 
&gt; In addition to his mother, Greenberg is survived by his younger brother, Jacob, and grandparents, Jerry and Sandy Greenberg. Lori Greenberg, who lives in St. Petersburg, said Josh’s friends would be arranging a memorial service in Gainesville.
&gt; 
&gt; She said her son had a keen intellect and a wonderful sense of humor. He was an animal lover who adored his three cats and was a vegetarian for ethical reasons.
&gt; 
&gt; “I call him a legend,” Kabinu said. “It’s weird to say that, but that’s what I think of him because he embodied a lot of what Gainesville innovation and startups and entrepreneurship is for a lot of people.”
&gt; 
&gt; “As a community, we definitely rallied behind him and we want to continue his legacy, so to speak, by continuing to be like he was — contribute back, mentor back, provide back. That’s the legacy we should all keep growing to remember him.”",2015-07-20 21:47:55+00:00,cta6khg,2.0,t1_ct9wo9i,14870.0,Music

I noticed that I ran my computers into the ground, and didn't bother getting a new one until the old one was hopelessly obsolete.  With that in mind, I'm not expecting to get a new computer for quite a long time, which nicely justifies the expense of getting my Mac Pro.

That said, I use mine for more than just gaming.  It's probably worth building yourself a nice little gaming rig for a modest amount of money and pocketing the difference, if that's what you're into. And hey, building PCs is pretty good fun!

I'm completely happy with it, and couldn't think of any way that getting more computer would satisfy my needs any more than it currently does.  The load I put on my system is more CPU- and memory-bound than GPU-bound though--running virtual machines, for instance.

Don't buy one though.  It's been nearly two years since they were released.  Odds are very good that Apple's about to, if nothing else, bump the specs on the machine.  I know mine feels like it's still a brand-new computer, but that's more a testament to how good it was in the first place.  It's a machine which is just shy of two years old, and they can (and should!) do better.  Keep your money in your wallet for the moment.

Another thing to remember is that the GPUs in the Mac Pro are optimised more for precision than for speed.  A gamer GPU is optimised for greater speed at the expense of not always getting all of its numbers right, which is unacceptable for a workstation GPU.  The market Apple is aiming at with the Mac Pro isn't the gamer market so much as it is the market which used to buy high-end UNIX workstations to run AutoCAD on.  With that in mind, I had to crank the resolution for many games down to 2560x1440 in order to get a proper 60fps frame rate (and Spec Ops: The Line refuses to deal with 4K at all, but I'm almost entirely certain the issue is with the game rather than with the hardware it's running on, judging by its debugging logs).",2015-07-11 13:41:04+00:00,cszoegy,3.0,t1_cszmy8b,4741.0,macgaming

Its positive neutral finder is nice though, if a bit overenthusiastic.  If you're not going quickly enough in first and try to shift into second, it assumes you're just standing still and gives you neutral anyway, which leaves you on a bike that's both disabled and making a ridiculous noise.

Have fun getting at the battery!  My hint to you is to go at it from the left-hand side, not from the right like other bikes might have fooled me into thinking about it.  I went on YouTube to look for a video of someone else changing the battery, and the best I could come up with was a scan of a lengthy forum post, in German, with way more exclamation marks in it than I found comforting.

2539,"I think you and I have different criticisms of Kawasaki's wonderful little bike.  It is a truly excellent bike, but holy crap can I ever nitpick the hell out of it.

For instance: I went to replace the battery in my W800, which is without a doubt the best bike I've ever owned.  It took me, I am not kidding, *two months* to successfully manage it.  I had no idea that taking the battery out would involve displacing the engine management computer, the fuse box and the air filter.  If you actually know what you're doing, it's still a good solid couple of hours of work, a significant part of that being clipping the zipties holding everything together and replacing them with [gear ties](https://www.niteize.com/collection/Gear-Tie.asp).  What the hell was Kawasaki even thinking when they did that?  Was it designed by the same people who designed Apple's toilet-seat iBook, which required you to remove literally every component in the entire machine before you could replace the hard drive?

Also, it has the weirdest gearbox I've ever encountered.  A UJM has a gearbox which features first, second, third, fourth, fifth and often sixth gears, and the gear ratios have a logical progression.  The W800 has a gearbox which features first, third, fifth, extra and bonus gears.  It easily gets up to about 100km/h in second gear, third is for cruising on the motorway, and the other two gears are basically there to help your fuel economy.

(At least it's not an MV Agusta Brutale which cheerfully has an advertised 97km/h in first.)

My old Suzuki ST250E had a similarly-eccentric gearbox, though, but in the opposite direction.  Its gear ratios were more like first, second, second, second, fifth.

2544,"You have good points.

I think the MRAs have some good points too.  I'm not a member of the community (and I'll probably demonstrate that by what I'm about to say), but I certainly agree with the good points they make. Men should be treated equally to women in things like child custody and time off work when a child is born, for example.  I have no argument with that kind of reasoning at all.  It's just sensible.  I also believe that in a domestic-abuse situation, weaponry is the great equalizer.  A woman can stab a man just as dead if she has a knife, as he can stab her.  I also believe that it's just as possible for the woman to be an aggressor in a domestic-abuse situation as it is for a man to.  I count myself lucky that I've never been in a domestic abuse situation in either the aggressor or aggressee role, so fortunately that's all hypothetical for me.  I feel for anyone who *is* the victim of a domestic abuser though.

I fear that if I became a member of the MRA community, the good points they make might well be drowned out by the negative things you mentioned, though, and that would serve to alienate me, much like how /r/atheism is a fantastic way of chasing atheists away from visibly identifying as atheists.  Me, I've resorted to saying I'm not religious (if it ever comes up), just to avoid being associated with the Internet atheism community.

Then again, the MRA community *is* a granfalloon (thanks, Kurt, for that excellent word), much like /r/atheism is a granfalloon for atheists.  It's a bunch of people who think they're members of a community because they think they agree on some idea or other, but they're really just people who use the idea as a point of identification above all other things.  Some toxic people who hate women and happen to be loud and obnoxious about it can totally taint the community at large, especially for people outside the community who might only get a carefully-curated-by-people-wishing-to-slander-the-community view of things.  Which I'm pretty sure is what's happened to the men's rights community at large.

It is especially unfortunate, though, that many people have been caused to conflate the mens-rights community and the pick-up-artist community, which actually is actively misogynistic (and misandrist to boot, they just hate everyone it seems, especially themselves).",2015-07-08 13:42:39+00:00,csw5r0v,2.0,t1_csw1m7n,11244.0,TiADiscussion

The nonsense they've been pulling recently makes me feel vaguely vilified in not making them a regular part of my web browsing.

I always appreciated IGN's game guides.  I think that they contributed positively to the gaming community with them.  It's a good thing that they've decided to steer clear of the whole GamerGate controversy in general, and redouble their efforts towards providing quality gaming coverage.

I also always appreciated, just to pick on a specific individual, Shamus Young's articles for the Escapist.  He was the reason I started reading the Escapist, because he always wrote intelligent, well-thought-out articles based on his knowledge and experience.  I excuse his lack of knowledge of, let's be honest, a political viewpoint, because he's never cared enough to leap into that particular fray.  It's not his bailiwick.  His knowledge of, well, ludology, on the other hand, is admirable to a fault.  When he talks about the theory of games, I pay attention, because what he has to say on those topics is always insightful and interesting.

As a bonus, both he and Ben Croshaw have written some fiction which is great fun to read.  [The Witch Watch](http://www.amazon.com/Witch-Watch-Shamus-Young-ebook/dp/B007AKDFM8) and [Mogworld](http://www.amazon.com/Mogworld-Yahtzee-Croshaw-ebook/dp/B00A7H2EI2/) (Amazon links: I carefully cropped off any affiliate bullshit that might have shown up) are both really entertaining stories.",2015-07-02 12:10:42+00:00,csprouz,4.0,t1_cspo3jp,14175.0,KotakuInAction

2591,"&gt; The irony is that with a lot of companies now, a woman could probably negotiate a higher salary than a man with the same qualifications 

Probably?  Certainly.

A woman I knew casually negotiated a salary that was a good 50% higher than mine, doing the same work I was doing (that is, programming), and she was as old as I was and had more-or-less the same experience I had.  We were literally equal in every way other than the fact she was a woman and I'm not.

To be fair, she was a significantly-more-aggressive negotiator than I was, which probably had more to do with the higher wage she earned than anything else.

Oh, and that was 15 years ago, long before everyone started fretting about how few women there were doing programming work, because apparently they'd forgotten that women have been doing absolutely fine work as programmers since the very start of computer science.

Unrelated, my team at work was hiring new members a year or two ago.  After going through a bunch of candidates, I asked my manager why on earth he hadn't invited any women in for any interviews.

Because he had a hobby of collecting icons of racist regimes from times past, various people in the US decided that they wanted to distance themselves from him, and people who might agree with his views and support them, by eliminating racist icons where they could.  While hardly anyone flies the old apartheid-era South African flag any more, quite a lot of people fly the Confederate flag out of a misplaced sense of Southern pride, and various people decided that it would be best on the whole if they stopped flying that particular banner any more.
