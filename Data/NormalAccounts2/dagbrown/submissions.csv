3,2016-10-10 12:09:35+00:00,self.scooters,https://www.reddit.com/r/scooters/comments/56rn2p/know_where_your_grounds_are_a_story_about_a/,False,"My scooter came over all Italian yesterday, suddenly losing the ability to tell me how fast I was going. It was quite strange, roaring along on the highway, passing all the other cars while the bike assured me I was going at 0km/h.

And related, it also stopped telling me how far I'd gone. I rode about 25km after dropping my girlfriend off at her place to home, a journey of, according to the odometer, 0km. This is considerably more serious because a motor vehicle with an odometer that doesn't measure how far you've travelled makes your vehicle very unroadworthy.  Odometer fraud is a serious offense.

I stopped by a local bike shop that deals primarily with imports, and the guy there told me that they were quite busy right now and that I'd have to make an appointment to get it fixed, and the mechanic would have to order parts in, and I was much better off taking it to the dealership where I'd bought it.

Since today was a national holiday here, I went to look on the dealership's web site to see if they were open today, and discovered that they weren't open, as it turned out. Nor tomorrow. Nor any other day until the end of October, on account of how they were moving to a new location. Well then. Do-it-myself time I guess.

So I had a look at the bike itself, and found the sensor on the front wheel which drives the speedometer and the odometer. I followed it all the way up to where it was plugged in (which involved taking the front fairing off, which was an amusing puzzle in itself, my scooter being Italian and all). I found no problems with that at all.

What I did discover was that the bolt holding it onto the front fork had gone missing, though. I had no idea what that had to do with anything, although it was probably for the best that it be fixed. As a way of testing it out, I grabbed a screw that I had lying around which was almost the right size and shape to fit the hole in the front fork that the sensor cable (and the brake line!) were attached to.

I took a little test ride around the block and to my amazement, my speedo was working properly again, and the odometer was counting up the miles again! I had no idea why that was though, but at least I knew what I could do to sort it out.

Since my bike has two front brakes, there's another brake line on the other side of the fork, held in place by a bolt with a 3mm Allen head connected to an identical brace as the one on the sensor side. I pulled that bolt out, put it in the side with the front wheel sensor, and it was a perfect fit. So now I had a plan of action: Go find another bolt like that, and install it.

So at least now I had a plan of action: I grabbed the bolt that I'd been playing with, popped it into the little coin pocket that jeans come with, hopped onto my other bike (I highly recommend having another motorcycle handy in case one suddenly becomes horribly illegal to ride), popped round to my local motorbike goods store, showed them the bolt and asked them if they had another one just like it.

The nice thing about a store like that is that they have a really clever little device for measuring all of the dimensions of some random bolt, so you can get a new one exactly like it. The man there spent about 30 seconds with his bolt-measuring device, walked me over to a shelf containing nothing but individual bolts, pointed at a couple and said ""One of these two are what you need. This one here seems like the closest."" So I bought that one.

I got it home, reinstalled the brace holding the sensor and brake line in place (along with a dab of Loc-Tite™️ to make sure it won't randomly fall out again), reinstalled the other brace holding the other brake line in place, took it out for a ride, and everything was working perfectly. It felt almost weird fixing my exotic Italian scooter's fundamental failing and only spending ¥172 (less than $2) to get the job done. I probably spent more than that just on depreciation on the other bike going to the store.

While I was doing all this, though, I did eventually figure out what made the speedometer and odometer quit working: the brace holding it to the front fork was doing double duty as an electrical ground for the whole works. Without the brace bolted in place, the sensor was just a random wire connected from the sensor node on the front wheel to the rest of the bike, but with it there, there was an actual electrical circuit.

Long story short: a seemingly-catastrophic mysterious failure might just be a simple problem with an easy, cheap fix.  If your bike goes wrong, it doesn't hurt to just examine it carefully and look for anything that might have gone amiss.  You could save yourself quite a lot of money that way.",scooters,Know where your grounds are: a story about a strange problem with my speedometer and how I fixed it,https://www.reddit.com/r/scooters/comments/56rn2p/know_where_your_grounds_are_a_story_about_a/
