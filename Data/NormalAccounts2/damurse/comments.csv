We know what to expect with Pittsburgh and we almost/should have beat them just a few weeks ago. Plus ben roethlisberger's INT issue is perfect for our stellar D.

KC over the Texans...everybody is scared of the Chiefs and I don't know why..Alex Smith is playing his worst games of the season. 

The Texans ARE a more beatable team, for most teams. Unfortunately, JJ Watt is a LOLB...which means Schofield or Polumbus have to protect our 90 year old QB from the best pass rusher in the league...that's their strongest position v. Our weakest...that outcome won't be good.

279,"In my experience, a few things could cause the 550 to 200 price discrepancy. Auction vs buy-it-now and page views. For in-demand books, I think auctions tend to go higher because people become committed to winning if they start bidding. The bidding also builds up over time. Whereas, buy-it-now may list low to sell fast and ensure that they get their minimum price. Also, exposure and page views. Some sellers have a huge stock and tons of followers that monitor their listings. They also have tons of feedback (trusted) and these seller's items come up on those buyers feeds so they may bid on a book that they might have otherwise not purchased or sought out. Alternatively, sellers with just a few reviews can get lost in the thousands of listings. 

As for CGC worth, it's expensive and I think you're looking at a loss if you slab anything current under a 9.6. Now that you've checked prices, do some research on grading comics. You don't have to be professional just look at what they consider so you can get an idea about your book grades. Also, find out the print run. If they printed  millions, probably not worth it unless the book is really hot and you're selling now. This is why all those 90's image, Marvel, and DC (ex. Death of superman) comics are worthless. People hoarded those thinking they were rare collectibles. On the other hand, Walking dead #1 printed just over 7000...and those high grades are selling for thousands. Though, with rarity, every CGC point is huge. A walking dead 9.6 can go for 800-1000 and 9.8 1000-1200 and a 9.9 10000+ (huge jumps with every point)

tl/dr 

1)Auction vs buy-it-now and page views 

2)Low print run, popular, early edition books of current age are the only ones worth slabbing IMO ",2015-08-09 18:09:41+00:00,ctx2lkt,1.0,t3_3gd0ph,6592.0,comicbookcollecting
