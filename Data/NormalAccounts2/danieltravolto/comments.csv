120,"i don't seem to attract much money in life... Most spiritual healers or channelers with big faith like Edgar Cayce, Hildegard von Bingen and others couldn't take money or would take very little for their help. I feel the same. The more you take the more you corrupt your energy. I am a huge helper so i would definitely help people in south american and Africa like Ghana. I have some contacts there who do great stuff for children. I am a big believer in investing in education. If you look at Osho, who lived quiet lavishly he ended pretty miserably as well. Money is only good for food and shelter. I have to google James Randi. I think i have heard that name before. I am a huge believer in Eckhart Tolle &amp; Mooji. Because both teach something that i can 100% confirm for myself. As to energy healing. It comes from thousands of years ago from direct experience of Sadhus and Gurus and Yogis from India. It even goes back to Egypt. The Giza Pyramids were constructed specifically for that. In India that knowledge was never corrupted because they have a culture of charishing that information through all those thousands of years. What we in the west are doing is just step by step rediscovering it &amp; because people pay for it we can dedicate more time to that. 

When you open peoples energy chakras you really notice the difference the next days. They might not notice it until i tell them but sometimes the experience is so intense they also notice it immediately. I also don't go out to try to be famous... I go from individual to the next. quality instead of quantity.

I just read a little bit about the challenge. Well i think by paranormal he means different things than telephathy and energy healing because a lot of people do both already with significant proof.

I think if you want to become a masseur, you have to learn to connect with women and think about THEM. which for most men is hard to do. at some point during the session they will think about themselves. women explicitly go to me because they don't need to give me anything except money in the end. my advice for anyone who wants to do this as well is first really learn yourself through spirituality. this has been my way... a few years ago i wouldn't have been able to do it just because i wouldn't be able to handle the mix of energies and also the reactions by some people on what i do. now that i just observe my emotions and thoughts it becomes easy as pie. Women come with a lot of baggage from their every day life. If you chose to focus on sexual massage only it wont go very far. Women are more complicated than that :-) that is the first and foremost reason why they come. I have clients that are married or in relationships. they come because men don't pay attention to them. only to their body and even that they dont do well. To make it simple.

As a cancer i think more about how and what i feel and that motivates me instead of what people think about me. just a general example. there are lots of nuances.

137,"extremely good questions:
I was VERY surprised how people reacted. Most women react positively. Especially the spiritual ones. Lots of curiosity. The only negative reactions were from women that had some obvious feminism issues. I was even called a cheap slut or a gigolo. But only by women that didn't even bother to read what i offer.
family: my parents are happy when i am happy. they also know i am very sensitive on energies. So they know i would immediately stop it if it didn't feel correct for me. I am a huge believer of following the heart. 
friends: i dont have that many friends but when i told some of them the reaction was positive especially from men. And surprisingly no jealously.

Only women because wherever i go i tend to hang around women naturally because i enjoy what they talk about. Each one of us is born with a certain yin-yang balance. I have lot of yin lots of feminine energies in me. It makes me prefer talking about hairstyles than about soccer for example :-) But i work spiritually with mixed groups in the summer for free in parks up to 10-20 people at a time sometimes smaller groups.

The unhappy affairs i talked about because i have a lot of sexual energy and i used to channel that into affairs. but i gave so much and it wasnt reciprocated. since receiving money i feel its reciprocated and when the client leaves i feel brutally happy and the client as well. I chuckle sometimes when i receive money because i feel like i did good and get paid for it.

The job pays low income for now so there is not much to pay in taxes but its mostly my own choice for now because i also work with women that don't earn much. i help them open their chakras energy centers so they can earn more. sometimes i even lower my price for them. But i could imagine a time in one or two years when word gets out about my services more that celebrities or rich women will book me and then i wouldnt have a problem charging 500-1000 an hour.

138,"depends what you mean by off.. if you really want her to intensely connect with you on all levels she has to trust you first... you gotta go EXTREMELY slow ... with touches and just be very sensual. let your energies connect for at least 60 minutes by just caressing slowly without being intimate. And there must be enough trust that she can confide her fears and worries to you. otherwise she will always have a blockage there. the mind of a woman can completely block off her connection to her sexuality. some women like everything rougher but its just a way to block off potential hurt. Deep inside they want to be nurtured like the real woman that she is. to make it simple for men think: lots of time &amp; lots of relaxation :-) after that caressing is done you can go and massage her hands and feet and then you can progressively increase the intensity you massage her butt and breasts. the basic mistake most men make is they assume that women are as quick as men. I have had women in my affaire time that i got to orgasm in the 15 minutes i first met them but that is not a connection. that is just a sexual excitement. It often leads to what they call in psychology ""buyers regret"". at first its awesome .. it might be even awesome a couple of times but at some point she realizes she wants more than that. Women love to fantasize more than men do. So if you hint on a possible fantasy that you would like to do with her and she likes the fantasy that will get her interested very quickly and get her ready for the first encounter. 

Another thing i want to add is that women are very very different amongst each other. Men are more similar. So one women might hate it that her ear is sucked while a lot of them love it. Women don't mind if you do something wrong but they want you to fix it quickly and they usually wont tell you. When she puts your hand away from somewhere or physically shows you she doesnt want it its already kind of late. You have to be really alert on the smallest changes she physically makes to see whether its something she wants or not. the most erogenous zones i have witness on women are ears, backside and side of neck and butthole aside from the obvious like breasts and vagina.

A good example from one of my affairs:
Before meeting i told her i want her to show up in a summer dress. Then as soon as she would be at the door i would pull down her panties to her thighs. make her bend forward against the wall and i would kneel behind her and dig my face into her butt doing cunnilingus. once we actually met i did exactly as i said and she went crazy with lust she could barely stand. So use fantasy but realize the fantasy is more about her. Once you start talking about yourself too much in the fantasy its off...

So i think you basically have two type of attractions:
the loving deep attraction &amp; the unknown stranger type of attraction.

in the first one you play with time and relaxation in the second one you play with fantasy.
Btw, which one they prefer depends pretty much on her period.. when she is close to her ovulation women prefer the unknown stranger more when she is just had it she likes more the nurturing slower type of connection",2015-12-07 13:30:49+00:00,cxq7v4v,2.0,t1_cxq7n1m,605.0,IAmA

140,"1. Excellent question. I explored spirituality following the likes of Sadhguru and Mooji.. after about 1 years continuous spiritual exercise i understood what it means to be in the now, in the I AM presence (pretty much like eckhart tolle lives) in that state i just started creating blogs and offering things which i thought i could do or would like to do. Then people contacted me and i started refining my skills and offerings in this ""I AM"" state... and thats how it became what it became.  

2. depends on where and how.. Spiritual sessions without promising anything in particular (like healing cancer) etc. is okay. Most regions in the world have a problem once you start saying you can heal stuff and take money for it. Some people circumvent this by offering services for free and selling things like herbs on the side.
