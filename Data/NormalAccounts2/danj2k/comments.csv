1,"Yes, the DM used the character builder to generate character sheets for each of us, and as you say, they are a bit unwieldy with several pages. He says that after we start levelling up the number of powers/abilities we have will grow quite a bit so ideally I'd like to sort out a good way to manage them before then.",2016-04-03 12:02:56+00:00,d1nzl56,2.0,t1_d1nye36,4695.0,DnD

3,"Having a bit of a problem with this, trying to deploy it to a PC but it's stuck on Step 2 - Install Audacity. Anyone know what might cause this or what I can try? It's not showing as ""failed"", it's just stuck on step 2.",2016-01-07 10:06:01+00:00,cyp6l6l,1.0,t3_3dk0nz,15076938.0,PDQDeploy

5,"Hello, I'm Danj#2393 (EU) from England.

I've been playing for a few months now, so I have all the basic class cards unlocked and have unlocked all the cards from Naxxramas and Blackrock Mountain. I've also done 17 Arena runs, though only one of them has been a high score.

I think I have a solid grasp of the basics, but my problem now is that no matter what I do I can't seem to break past Rank 15 in a season.

While I don't have any videos of my regular gameplay I do have videos of my Arena runs, these can be found [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLes3MleMtB3s4IJXUlHJr3pcyLLvhTIxQ).

Mage is my favourite class (I've already levelled it up to 60 and am at around 400 wins in Ranked), plus I really like the mechs from the GvG set.

If anyone has any pointers they can give me that would be much appreciated!",2015-07-12 20:55:55+00:00,ct103y3,1.0,t3_3d001z,41897.0,hearthstone
