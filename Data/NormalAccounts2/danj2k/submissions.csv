I tried searching musipedia using Parsons code but no luck.

EDIT: maybe the repeating part I put in was too short and it's actually this http://onlinesequencer.net/347704?

I'm subscribed to Netflix but in the UK they only have a few of the movies and none of the TV stuff at all. I tried searching on sites like JustWatch.com but all I can find is that it's available for (expensive) download purchase on sites such as Amazon Instant Video or Apple iTunes.

Leafing through the pages of the character sheet each time to look at the available powers/attacks is time consuming, is there an app (Android or Windows - I don't own any Apple devices) that would simplify this process? It's 4th Edition that we're playing.

Failing that, is there a good template to use for printing out flashcards of character abilities?",DnD,App to help with character abilities/powers?,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/4d5pu7/app_to_help_with_character_abilitiespowers/

Recently one of the shared printers on there has been giving the error ""Unable to write uncompressed print data. Broken pipe"" for any print job sent to it.

I tried deleting and recreating the queue, which seemed to work for a while but the next day went back to giving the same error.

I looked in the CUPS error_log and found the problem was something to do with the CUPS gziptoany filter which ""stopped with status 1"". But I've no idea where to go from there.

For the moment, Mac users in that classroom are able to print to the classroom next door, and with the Easter break coming up I've got a little time, but I really need to get this sorted before the beginning of next term.

Anyone got any suggestions? I already tried posting about this on JAMF Nation as we have Casper Suite, but got no responses, so figured I'd try here.",macsysadmin,Broken pipe error on shared Mac print queue,https://www.reddit.com/r/macsysadmin/comments/4bdvz3/broken_pipe_error_on_shared_mac_print_queue/
