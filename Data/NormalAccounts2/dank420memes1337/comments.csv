&gt; It really isn't. In the beginning, there were a lot of refugees (so many that we were not ready for), but the immigration crisis has died down now to a point where you can't call it a crisis anymore. I personally have not met a single foreigner who insulted me, tried to rob me or was even remotely mean to me. Most of the refugees in my hometown (pretty small town in central Germany) speak our language pretty well (at least better than I speak arabic if I say so myself) and are ready to give and take help if needed. We had a pretty large percentage of foreigners in my town already (mostly from Russia and Turkey), but over the course of this year, I've seen a few more people from Balkan and Northern Africa. I personally was not even remotely affected by this, for me nothing in my life changed because of this crisis. Literally the worst moment I had with a foreigner was when I was on the train next to a guy from Morocco just last week, and when our tickets were checked he noticed that he forgot to leave the train on his station because he didn't fully understand the announcements in the train.

&gt; tl:dr what you hear the alt-right saying about the immigrant situation here is all just over-dramatized fear mongering (something they are experts at). Sadly there is a political party here (AfD) who does exactly that and is rather successful.

974,"The strict gun laws of the Weimar Republic were loosened a bit when Hitler took power. Nazi party members as well as military personel during their free time were allowed to carry pistols and revolvers around, but people that were seen as ""poltically unreliable"", like Jews, Communists or people with strong connections to criminal organisations, were not allowed to carry any weapons at all. This took effect virtually right after Hitler took power, but another article was passed in the late 1930s, saying that any weapons acquired prior to the ban may be confiscated (in the Weimar Republic, only the military ranks of Captain and above were entitled to own a handgun in  the first place). So, if someone with the rank of Captain or above recieved a handgun during his military service in the Weimar Republic, he was allowed to keep it at home, even if he was seen as politically unreliable; with the second article these weapons could be confiscated. Then again, being allowed to own a weapon and being allowed to carry it around are two completely different things.",2016-06-27 18:51:22+00:00,d4q6wp1,1.0,t3_4q4ukg,1539.0,history

980,"I think Dmitry Ovcharenko deserves a mention here:

It happened at the place of Pesets on July 13, 1941. Dmitriy was driving a car with ammunition for the 3rd company, which was in 4-5 kilometers, when he was attacked. He was surrounded by two cars with 50 German soldiers and 3 officers. Leaving the car, a German officer ordered him to lift his hands up, knocked the gun out of his hands and began to interrogate him. But Dmitriy had an axe in his wagon. He took the axe and killed the officer. Then he threw three grenades to the Germans. As a result 21 German soldiers were killed, the others ran in panic. Dmitriy ran after the second officer, caught him and also killed him. The 3rd officer managed to escape.

But Dmitriy kept his head, took documents from all the killed, maps, tablets, schemas and records from the officers, and delivered them to the staff of his regiment. By the way the ammunition was delivered on time.",2016-06-26 11:35:32+00:00,d4oimce,1.0,t3_4pxci0,1019.0,history

In this book, it's clearly stated that the Empire makes extensive use of Wookie slaves for the construction of the Death Star, having enslaved Kashyyk just to get access to an almost infinite source of workes. Though it is not exactly mentioned how Vader thinks about it, he often treats the Wookie slaves as sub-human. 

In short, the Empire had a lot of slaves, but did not enslave humans. Vader neither says anything against it, nor does he speak in favour of slavery.",2016-04-21 09:01:30+00:00,d2bhgjx,1.0,t3_4frpw9,9689.0,StarWars

1239,"There are many different ways, one is simply placing a PVA (poly vinyl acetate) foil on the glass. This material approximately has the consistency and thickness of plastic wrap. The manufacturing process begins by heating and stretching PVA to five times its natural length, making it even thinner. This lengthens PVA's long chain molecules, causing them to align. The stretched PVA is then dipped in iodine solution. The iodine is absorbed into the molecular chains forming long grids of parallel, darkened lines that are not visible to the human eye. The film is then dyed to the color of the desired finished film. The darker the film, the more polarization it provides. In the last step, the film will be applied on the glass.",2016-04-20 11:41:37+00:00,d2a6czs,1.0,t3_4fmsf6,2542.0,askscience
