I'm currently trying to implement a very quick and robust image processing program, that will recognize if an image is in the frame or not at different altitudes. We can match any object (such as a white paper in a field), however, we thought facial recognition with a printed out face is the easiest, as there are many open source projects already out there. 

The best thing I have been able to find so far is this: (https://realpython.com/blog/python/face-recognition-with-python/), however, it has many issues. 


1.) The processing is very slow, even with a potential tradeoff between speed and accuracy.
2.) The scale factor has to be modified every meter the drone moves up, therefore proving to be very inaccurate.


Are there any good solutions to this problem? ",computervision,Drone - Python Boolean Template Matching,https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/525soq/drone_python_boolean_template_matching/

So recently I made a pretty dumb app, which used sound effects from the ""Damn Daniel"" viral videos. I was just today contacted by the Damn Daniel kids' lawyers, asking me to remove the app from the app store, due to copyright infringements. Thanks for all replies!

Is there anything I can do to comply with these standards, and not take the app down?

Does anyone know how to use this rotary encoder? 

Here is the unassembled piece: http://prntscr.com/a4oq41.
I managed to assemble it looking at the product description, etc;. However, now that I have assembled it, I am stuck with this picture. http://prntscr.com/a4oqfj.

Where do all the wires go :D
