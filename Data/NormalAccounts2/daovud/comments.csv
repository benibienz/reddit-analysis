8,"I literally started playing for the first time last night, it can initially be very overwhelming in my opinion, there is just so much to do.  It's a lot and you will get your moneys worth. 

I played maybe 2 hours and only spent about 20 minutes on the main quest line and barely got out of the starting village because of all the other stuff I was doing.  I also found out I don't like playing Zerker so I will be switching to a new character tonight if I get on.  The combat is initially cake because you don't have to do much avoidance but from what I hear that will change when you get to higher levels and start fighting tougher mobs that can one shot pretty much anyone.

Anyways, long story short, it's worth $30 for a game you can always play afterwards.  You will find something you love.",2016-03-14 21:16:49+00:00,d0ztpqi,1,t3_4af1bl,1588,blackdesertonline

I hate being stomped in the middle of the quest line as much as the next guy but I love that it provides some variance.  That being said I do really like your suggestion that there needs to be some faction incentive to open world PVP knowing fully well that will bring its own string of issues (i.e.high levels ganking low levels making progression impossible) but if implemented properly I think open world PVP could be phenomenally fun.

I'm not down with that.  I completely get it and you can play however you want but I personally still try to kill anyone of the opposite faction that is within my level range (I don't gank low levels) and I always wear my faction colors so they can attack me too.
