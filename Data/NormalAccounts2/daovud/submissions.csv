I am extremely interested.  I jumped on the BnS band wagon pretty early on and didn't look into BDO at all but now that I have heard some things and looked a bit into it I'd like to know:

- What are the first impressions that people are having?  
- Should I play this game if, due of time constraints, I'm a filthy casual that only puts in a few hours a week?  
- Will I enjoy a slow and steady progress or will I quickly just despise the grind?

Thank you in advance.",blackdesertonline,I'm interested...,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackdesertonline/comments/49kaui/im_interested/

Is Warlock worth me taking the time to level?  

Pretend I know nothing about warlocks (which I don't).  Are they high mobility?  Glass cannons?  Do they stun lock?  What are the pros, what are the cons?

I feel like I'm the best luck charm for everyone other than myself because the majority of people I go through with have gotten the Blight weapon they need for their Hongmoon weapon and I keep getting swords and gauntlets!

Waaaah, waaaah, waaaah, but seriously how long does it normally take to snatch up the Blight Axe?!?!

EDIT: Seems the consensus is to keep at it I need to run it ATLEAST 10 times anyways for achievement so I'll just suck it up and go, as an unofficial no attachment at all representative of NCSoft I'd like to say ""The game is functioning as expected.""",bladeandsoul,Blight Weapon - am I doing it wrong?!?,https://www.reddit.com/r/bladeandsoul/comments/468ser/blight_weapon_am_i_doing_it_wrong/
