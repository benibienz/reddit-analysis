He was a really nice guy and never took it very harshly and started cracking up once people started yelling it. For the senior prank, in the middle of the night several of us created a nest with the principal's face shopped onto a bald eagle and wedged it between two pillars. It took them a really long time for them to get the nest out.

120,"Something similar happened to my gf before I met her. She had just broken up with Josh, for the sake of the story, and was at a party hosted by Michael (obviously a different name). After the party died down she was hanging out with Michael and her car was the only one outside his house. Josh had previously tracked her phone in Find My iPhone and decided to follow her this night. He saw her car outside Michael's house and apparently got super pissed and decided to slash her tires. She comes outside and sees his very distinctive blue BMW peel off and notices her tires are fucked. 

She calls up both her mom and her brother, but they don't pick up. She ended up calling her brother's best friend, Sam. He comes over and drives her to Josh's house, tells her to stay in the car while he knocks on the door. Mind you it's around 2 am. He knocks on the door and his parents (for some reason) are awake and ask him what the hell he wants at this hour. He explains that he has reasonable suspicion that their son slashed my SO's tires, but they say that he couldn't have, he's been home all night. 

While this is all happening, Josh comes down the stairs and is acting really nervous. Sam says ""okay I didn't want to, but I think I should get in touch with the police"". Both of Josh's parents get freaked out and ask Sam to excuse them while they speak to their son. Josh comes out about 10 minutes later and says ""Hey I'm really sorry your tires got slashed, I'll pay for them but I didn't slash your tires."" My gf is obviously pissed because she knows his car well and knows that he slashed the tires.

Either way, she's happy because he payed out of pocket for her tires and she knows his parents probably layed into him from the next couple days.

209,"My friend and I decided to go mudding out in a field past some houses. The kicker is that it had just snowed and to get into the field it was a steep decline. Meaning when you left it, you had to go uphill. We realized our mistake when we couldn't get his truck to turn around (he was driving a rear wheel drive pick up at the time). 

We finally ended up calling one of our friends to come tow us out. By this time it was around 6 pm, and dark outside. After about an hour of maneuvering the truck and tow straps, we finally pulled the truck up and out of the field... Right into one of the house's fences. The owner came out of his house with a shotgun slung over one shoulder, a holstered pistol, a pistol in his right hand, and an LED flashlight in his left. He started yelling at my friend from outside his trucks window, while shining the flashlight in his face. He finally opened up his door and pulled my friend out of the car. The man literally dragged him to the back end of the car while holding the pistol up and still shining the light in his face. He said something along the lines of ""IF YOU COME ONTO MY PROPERTY AGAIN I WON'T HESITATE TO PULL THIS TRIGGER, YOU HEAR ME SON?"" and then started yelling his license plate number into his face. He then turned my friend around and shoved him towards the door. The man came back around to the passenger side, and started shining the flashlight at me and yelling. I started yelling at my friend to get the ever living fuck out of there. 

I know what we did was stupid in every single way, but I was 17 at the time, and I'd never gotten into trouble with a man that had 3 guns on his person. Scary shit.

Finally the professor asked a student who wasn't very bright to come to the front of the class explain his calculations. In the middle of the student's ramblings, the professor tossed an object to him, and the student caught it. The professor went on to explain that there are inherent calculations going on on your head at any given moment, from catching a ball to just about how high your feet should go when climbing steps. 


Edit: sorry for not clarifying before you read that block of text. It is a fantasy novel, but the main idea you need to take from this is that your mind does its own subconscious calculations. ",2015-07-18 06:33:12+00:00,ct7h4xn,1,t3_3dosas,20775,Showerthoughts
