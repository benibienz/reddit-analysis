which part of not looking in the eye and say it straight is hard to understand ?? i did not say he did not answer, he looks down 1 or 2 times, lying or not doesn't look like even believes it.

Well in case you still don't know drivers don't launch legal disputes with teams at least the ones who want to continue in f1. Alonso always maintained his issue was not with ham but with ron.

Monaco ron telling 'you sholld thank lewis' were not exact words but here is an [article in bbc](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/andrewbenson/2010/05/alonso_overreaching_in_reargua.html)
&gt;This has never come out before, but it was Dennis's actions after that race that so angered Alonso, and which convinced him the team would always be behind Hamilton and not him. That was the backdrop to the tumultuous fall-out that enveloped McLaren and Alonso as that famous 'spy-gate' summer unfolded.

&gt;As a McLaren insider revealed to me: ""Fernando won in Monaco fair and square in 2007.

&gt;""Lewis was generally quicker through the weekend, but in qualifying Fernando did it and Lewis didn't. Lewis was quicker in the first run but then he made mistakes and Fernando got pole.

&gt;""Fernando won the race because he pulled an 11-second gap in the first stint when Lewis had (tyre) graining and after that Fernando was just cruising because we had rear brake issues.

&gt;""But after the race, Ron said to Fernando: 'Be nice to Lewis because we had to (pit) stop him early.' And Fernando said: 'What do you mean? I was just cruising.'

&gt;""He got very annoyed about that because it was like Ron saying we handed you the victory. Even after that, the relationship was unrecoverable.""

Hungary ofcourse alo broke rules so got penalized, whatever the circumstances are its not alonso's problem that he could grab his advantage in previous race, it was ham who broke team rules and bitch about to media n fia even if its against team, he has done that his whole carrier.

Well you really lose credibility with those statements about heidfield.

17,"Alonso still says racing with stoff next year will be different to '07 coz hes not british and team is international now etc etc he said that few weeks back, so he still believes ham got preferential treatment. 

Trouble b/w ron and alonso actually started in monaco, after the win ron says to alo something like 'you should thank ham for victory' which pissed off alonso who said 'i was cruising and ready to react if attacked' and in hungary it was ham who instigated first by not letting alonso to qualify 2nd, even ron defended fernando saying that weekend was alonso's turn to qualify 2nd. 

Everybody made mistakes including alonso who by blackmailing for preferential treatment later apologized for doing that. About alonso getting booted, there are 2 different versions, one is board did not want him, other is they mutually agreed to split which is what i believe and backed by DC many times who said 'i respect the man for not willing to compromise his values just to be in competitive car and decided to go away just to be around ppl he is comfortable working with' , so I take DC's word for it. And both ham n alo were political , ham did everything behind the scenes, even ron said ham was partly responsible for debacle after signing alonso for 2015.

And priestly in last f1 mid-week report when asked face to face by tambay that if ham got preferential treatment coz he is  british, he wouldn't look him in the eye n say it straight, i wouldn't believe the guy, he is ham's fan and so biased, he wouldn't even acknowledge good performances from alonso on the show.

And yes. experience with tires is huge deal, both kimi and alo struggled a bit at start , thats why they both came alive in 2nd part of the season, many journalists who got info from team insiders said that and it is fact that gp2 '06 cars ran bridgestones so ham had experience on those compounds. Denying the advantage is being delusional.

&gt; **Red Bull wants 2017 at the latest win again. But the former world champion gearing up massively. In Milton Keynes, a new test and a 360-degree simulator installed as has the formula 1 never seen. The contract with Renault to be extended even in Monte Carlo.**


&gt;The years in which Red Bull has won everything, lie back for a while. Between 2010 and 2013, the troops of Red Bull cleared all trophies. Then came the hybrid era, and Mercedes became the new series winner. This will change no later than next year again Red Bull. The cops had to get used to the losing. In almost the partnership with engine supplier Renault would have gone to pieces.
What was a marriage of convenience beginning of the year, begins slowly set right again. Red Bull recorded that Renault is the engine wide on the right track. The French are currently the only manufacturer still had no defect in the drive unit. And Monaco upgrade takes full praise for Red Bull. ""Everything Renault has promised has arrived,"" said team boss Christian Horner says.
He reveals that Red Bull may still be in Monte Carlo extend the engine contract with Renault. Renault sporting director Cyril Abiteboul expressed somewhat more cautious: ""Red Bull is as usual a tough negotiator, but it is the mutual wish to carry on as we have Red Bull demonstrated that we are making progress...""

&gt;**Red Bull can try on each racetrack**

&gt;Red Bull already knew before the first test of the engine development stage, what they expect on the track. This year, the new super-test rig went online. On it, the complete car can be tested.
The driver sits in the simulator, and in an adjoining room, the car runs on rollers, including the engine, transmission and tires as it would be on the track. Also external influences such as temperature can be simulated. Never was simulation so close to the race track. So also benefits Renault. ""In Viry they are not ready with the test stands,"" says team advisor Helmut Marko.
Niki Lauda was amazed: ""Since we have Red Bull is one step ahead."" On the VTT test (Virtual Test Track) from Mercedes can only engine and transmission in the car can be tested. From chassis itself, there is no driving data. But this can be 2017 for Red Bull to trump card. Because Formula 1 cars with wider tires and breaking new ground. While the competition must be limited to the official winter testing, Red Bull can drive day and night. And on any racetrack.

&gt;**Realistic driving impressions in 360 ° simulator**

&gt;Built by AVL test is only part of the Red Bull attack on Mercedes, which has reportedly cost 30 million euros. This includes the new 360-degree simulator from Cruden. No other system provides the driver with a so realistic impression. The car stands on a platform which can rotate around its own axis. In a cross upright, the vehicle must no longer be returned to the original position. It is readjusted simply the horizon.",2016-05-26 15:43:05+00:00,d3kjcnr,1.0,t3_4l5wr7,204,formula1

&gt;The shape curve of McLaren-Mercedes is uphill. However, in small increments. Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button start the Spanish GP from places 10 and 12. For the first time this year, so there is a car of the second oldest Formula 1 teams in the top ten. The track layout was contrary to the McLaren MP4-31. The motor does not play the decisive role in Barcelona.
Fernando Alonso classified its leap into Q3 as a small step in the right direction. ""It's a milestone. The next must be to regularly finish in the points, then the podium. Our way is not very true ups and downs, but the general direction."" Barcelona is noisy Alonso a course that shows the strengths and weaknesses of a car well: ""There are all kinds of curves, but there is also a long straight where you see what your car can..""
Honda wants to upgrade in two steps
At the end of the home straight the McLaren drivers 12 km / h is missing on the fastest cars. At the finish line it is only 7 km / h. This is consistent with the analysis of team boss Eric Boullier: ""We are losing mostly to the second half of the line time."" This is engine power and a little air resistance. Honda race director Yusuke Hasegawa promises improvement. In Canada, the first step is to come, in Spa the second.
With the chassis McLaren wanted to be number 1 in Barcelona actually. So Alonso it had announced at the winter testing. The Spaniard corrected himself: ""Right now we have the third best chassis This is the respective third sector in Sochi and here as only Mercedes and Red Bull are faster than we Ferrari, Williams and Force India are behind us...."" In fact, Alonso was 29.198 seconds with just four tenths slower than Lewis Hamilton and two-tenths as Daniel Ricciardo. Where it is lacking? ""We need more mechanical grip."" For Boullier the formula is simple: ""More power means more downforce.""",2016-05-14 18:19:50+00:00,d35gu1d,1.0,t3_4jchli,72,formula1

&gt;Pirelli conceals redesign
New tires since Brazilian GP
At a meeting of the  Pirelli chief and FIA race director Charlie Whiting an incredible story came to light: According to Pirelli at the GP Brazil have introduced a new type of tire without the teams knowing about it.

&gt;Pirelli has signed with Bernie Ecclestone signed a contract for 2017-2019. The contract with the FIA, however, is always still not signed. ""The lawyers already hatched the paperwork,"" said Pirelli's motorsport director Paul Hembery in Melbourne.

&gt;It is no secret that FIA president Jean Todt favored Michelin as tire partner. And that teams of Pirelli demand tires that do not break irrevocably, once they have been called too hard.

&gt;The recent incident will further strain the relationship of trust between the FIA, the teams and Pirelli. At a meeting between Pirelli, the art directors and FIA race director Charlie Whiting an incredible story came to light: Allegedly Pirelli has been the GP Brazil 2015 a new type of tire introduced without the FIA or any team knew about it.

&gt;It should be the tires which have been officially tested two weeks later in Abu Dhabi after the season finale. So the tires with tread ply. The loud Hembery not fulfilled the purpose that it should fulfill.

&gt;It was meant as a warning system for the driver when the tire is too badly worn. A CTO meant to Auto Motor und Sport : ""We are not sure what we tested in Abu Dhabi at all.""

&gt;Pirelli tire covers man-update
The story came to light because a for Lotus parked Pirelli technicians had apparently forwarded accidentally an email from the Pirelli headquarters with the information about the new type of tire to the Lotus Engineering Department.

&gt;Great influence had no tire change for the last two Grand Prix of the year, 2015. The balance of power remained the same. The parties are still sour. The tire supplier is obliged to communicate technical modifications to the tires with the teams and the FIA. The question is whether this scandal will have consequences.

&gt;On the disillusionment followed one of the most constructive meetings in the history of the Technical Commission. The technique bosses dictated Pirelli, what they expect from the tire for 2017th And Pirelli promised to comply with everything.

&gt;The teams want a tire that maintains a complete race distance under all conditions in construction. Namely, that you have to pump up the tires for safety reasons at about 20 PSI without. In fact, many cars are already in the race illegal. Because the pressures fall below the values ​​at safety car phases, which are made by Pirelli.

&gt;The teams also call for a tire which is not immediately collapses during aggressive riding and then never recovered. This was identified as a major problem when overtaking. When the subsequent driver ascends too dense and loses output, the tires start slipping through overheating. They are then unusable for an overtaking maneuver.

&gt;Test Base is an upgraded 2015er car
Wanted are tires of the rubber compound not only develop in different ways depending on grip, but also break down just as decidedly different. An engineer explains: ""The differences between the various types of tires must be such that the softer tire brings more lap time, but according to more wear So the bottom line, the hard tires without pit stop as soon as the soft tire pit stop that would.. much more strategies allow. ""

&gt;In the question of how the wider tires to be tested in 2017 in June, you are a small step further. It was agreed that the base should be a 2015er car that is aerodynamically upgraded to 25 percent more downforce.

&gt;Here still some obstacles in the way: HaasF1 has no 2015er car. Teams that have changed over the winter the engine manufacturer are not eligible for the tests also in question. And then there is the question whether the additional wind tunnel and CFD time to 25/25 quota counts or not. If not, that would be a gift for the teams in question, because you could incorporate already 2017er developments in the test carrier.",2016-03-18 04:47:16+00:00,d146zmj,1.0,t3_4awvij,402,formula1

&gt;Williams confused the competitors
&gt;underfloor wing not legally
&gt;Williams grabbed in testing at the Red Bull Ring in a detail that alerted the competition. A mounted on the subfloor wing before the rear wheels. We have nachgeblättert the regulations and clarify. The part is not legal.
&gt;
&gt;When Formula 1 test at the Red Bull Ring all eyes were on the Williams FW37. For once not because Susie Wolff sat in the cockpit. The techies focused their eyes more on the base plate in front of the rear wheels. And was dominated by a double-deck wing. The bottom plate itself was bent to the outside over a length of 30 centimeters down.
&gt;
&gt;The immediately alerted the competition. And turned excitedly question: Is this part legal? Can there still other constructions are assembled? And if so, why are we not even thought of it? Auto Motor und Sport has checked with other teams and consult the rulebook of the FIA.
&gt;
&gt;Radius usually kills the Williams-wing
&gt;A competitive team taught us from: ""Definitely illegal Looks like Williams wanted to simulate easily more downforce on the rear axle.."" The skirt on the underbody does not meet, according to experts rule the Regulations. We then dug in the FIA ??rulebook and are in Article 3.8. become the Technical Regulations find. With the accompanying drawings.
&gt;
&gt;Generally speaking, above the ground can bodies without restriction for the shape only in a maximum of 50 millimeters height be mounted minus bottom plate thickness. The area of ??the rear axle to the rear edge cockpit is from 100 millimeters above the reference plane restricted area, in the drawing (see gallery) green hatched.
&gt;
&gt;There no parts must be fitted with surfaces whose radius is less than 75 millimeters. The edged additional wing meets neither the height requirement, yet the radius rule. Since 2009, the FIA ??has such extensions put a stop here.
&gt;
&gt;Rule-clause 3.4.8:
&gt;Under Article 3.4.8 the rulebook of the designed purpose of Williams area is divided into 4 zones. The radius rule applies in this case for point 3.4.8.a): ""The volume between 50mm forward of the rear wheel center line and 300mm Rearward of the rear face of the cockpit entry template, Which is more than 25mm from the car center line and more than 100mm above the reference plane. ""
&gt;
&gt;The Forbidden Zone in German: In the space between the points 50 millimeters in front of the rear axle and 300 millimeters behind the rear cockpit edge, for all areas that are outside of 25 millimeters the vehicle center line and 100mm above the reference plane.
&gt;
&gt;In our gallery we show photos of the new wing and the corresponding graphs of the Regulations.
