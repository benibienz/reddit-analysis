I had some very strong urges to PMO yesterday because It was the weekend and I has some free time, but I fought the hell out of it. I resisted and made it until I was going to bed! While I slept my mind kept making me have dreams of sex and I would wake up covered in sweat. Even though it was 68 degrees in the house and I had 3 fans on in the room. I wanted to PMO SOOO BAD because I am so used to doing it, but I said no! I thought about how I would feel and I resisted. I went back to sleep and woke up and realized that it was my fucking mind that made all that shit happen to me. My mind craved something and tried to make me believe that I needed it, but it was also my mind that told me I didn't. At the end of the day, it is up to you if you want to get better. Process your thoughts and fight the urges. You can seriously do it!
