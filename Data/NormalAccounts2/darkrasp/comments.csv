True, but there is a real simple formula to convert PPM to percentage, and vice versa.  Given either value, you can flip it to a very close copy of what we're looking for.

In this research, I don't expect to find data on every weapon.  As mentioned, I have about 150/250 right now.  You can compare the DPS from a similar-itemlevel weapon of the same type without a proc, and then by doing some mathemagic with the proc damage, expected dps, and attack speed, figure out an approximate proc rate that will give you the desired dps amount.

Doing that math is just a lot of tedious work, and it requires some baseline values to compare to.  The more contemporary data we can dig up, the more accurate the final result will be.  :D",2016-11-15 05:47:29+00:00,da0xqo2,2.0,t1_da0ci12,30261.0,wowservers

7,"Again, I don't super want to get into this, and account data isn't my area of expertise in the first place, but you can send a character database without revealing encrypted data like passwords.  There have also been several instances, historically, of private servers selling or leaking their account data so new servers could email bomb potential new players.  Emulation hasn't exactly been a haven for the most honorable of individuals over the years.  I would assume the Nostalrius staff have higher standards and wouldn't go that far, they always came off as very principled and genuine, but there is precedent for it.

Without being an expert in the matter, since Nostalrius and Elysium both ran on a MaNGOS core, the structure of the account database should be very similar, if not exactly the same.  Data could likely be imported with a minimum of fuss if they desired to do so, particularly if the core is also leaked/gifted (although Elysium's recent announcement that they are looking for devs to backport Trinity casts some doubt on that).

As to why they would do it.. As I mentioned above, the Nostalrius staff have always come off as strongly principled.  They probably feel obligated to continue the pursuit of Legacy realms in whatever manner they deem will be most effective.  If they are unable to reopen their own realms due to legal concerns, then perhaps their course of action would be to restart-by-proxy through another realm.

At present, that's purely speculation.  The likelyhood of it happening is very much still in question.

It's a secret.

Edit:  This is a bit of a tricky one, since the old graphics were available back when those items could still drop in Molten Core.  Because they're moving to BWL, putting them in means they would be that way for a long time by necessity.  Still, the models are in the game and it's trivial to do.  So, you'll see what we decide to do.


With respect to the R14 weapons, they were buffed when BWL was released, not AQ (though they are AQ-tier in terms of power, they were in game much earlier than that).  Our intention is to release the honor system and BWL such that the first R14's will be getting their weapons at the same time BWL is released, removing the necessity of nerfing them back to their original values, simply because they won't be obtainable until their nominal buff period anyways.

I already scripted all of the dungeon trash, and ~90% of the instance bosses.  We'll need to test and tweak their numbers, of course, but the point is they are ready to test.

I could teach you to write a boss script in about 5 minutes, and if you were going to write something like Gehennas or Lucifron, you could do so in about 10 minutes, even if it was the very first script you ever wrote, and it would be pretty close to perfect.  The raids haven't been touched yet, but that's only because Asura insists on doing them himself.

Yes, there are some complex encounters that take longer to write, but most boss scripts are very simple to make.  A given instance only takes a couple hours at most to write.

I've stated a few times that I disagree with a few of the decisions made by the Nostalrius staff, and I expressed confusion with how long it took them to fix some pretty simple -but major- bugs.  That said, I understand all too well that a development staff can only handle so much at a time, and lower priority tasks do tend to get pushed off the table.
We don't intend to be critical of Nostalrius, but in many cases people will ask us about ourselves in comparison to them, and perhaps we are a little eager to boast about our own capabilities.  Using them as a reference for ourselves in that capacity could be interpreted as bashing in some cases.  Please accept my apologies for that, it was not my intention to put them down.

We are picking a cap based on economic and playstyle factors, it has nothing to do with the technical capacity.  Our core is efficient enough to run an extremely high population, we just don't want it.  We understand that the cap has to be slightly higher to account for the regional spread of players, but we aren't going to touch 10k caps.  We'll *likely* begin spinning up a second realm if we hit 5k online, though we won't hard cap the initial server there, *probably* closer to 6k instead, giving us a buffer.

People seem to think ""but dynamic spawns!"" is the solution for high populations, and we can and will do them in some places, but you have to be extremely judicious with how they are used or they cause more problems than they solve.  Dynamically increasing the spawn rate for low-level quest mobs or gameobjects is one thing, but certain economically high-value herbs/ores/mobs absolutely cannot be made to dynamically spawn faster.  If a group of players is watching over these spawn points, then dynamically increasing the spawn rates only feeds more and more resources to the handful of players already controlling them.

Just want to clear up a few bits of misinformation.  It's largely correct but there are a few things wrong and/or misleading in there.

 Nostalrius staff who have joined are in fact support staff, not devs or admins.

Pretty sure we're launching with Maraudon, not Dire Maul though.

Itemization won't be exactly Blizzlike (too much work), but it'll be a reasonable compromise.

A lot more than 3 months real time of work had gone into CF, but he's correct in substance.  This was just a hobby project for us until fairly recently.  We've put more effort into this in the last year than the previous four combined.

Two accounts per IP is also not a firm plan, more of an example of ways to combat multiboxing.  We're not 100% certain what that's going to look like yet, but we're not ruling out an IP cap.

Our clustering is nothing like Nostalrius' clustering.  Their planned implementation was a system much closer to ""phasing"".  We actually separate continents and instances onto separate physical machines, and have a realmserver than handles communication between them.  Nobody else does that (Edit:  except Blizzard).

Cross server battlegrounds are an interesting function.  Normally you have all these Worldservers (EK, Kalimdor and Instances) that talk to each other through a single Realmserver.  Multiple Worldservers, one Realmserver.  If you do cross server battlegrounds, you have to create a Battleground server which can talk to multiple Realmservers simultaneously.  We will have to build an entirely new executable to do that.  A lot of it is cut and paste, obviously, but there is enough new functionality in there to make it a fairly big job.  We can do it, of course, but we don't want to push back release for it, especially if the BG queues are pretty good anyways and it isn't necessary.  It's something we'll look at adding post-launch if the queues start to be a problem.

Gold membership is a concept, not a plan.  We have no solid decisions on what the donation shop will look like ATM, except that it won't stock gameplay-affecting items. ",2016-08-22 03:42:01+00:00,d6rfxn3,1.0,t3_4yvtd7,38631.0,wowservers

I suspect that our Beta is going to start off as a giant mess.  We already know that we will have dozens of broken spells and scripts, I suspect there are more than a handful of typos in my creature AI and loot work that will have to be corrected.  The point is, we know what we're up against, we're competent to get it done right, and we're willing to put in the time and effort to do so.

71,"Interesting read, if a little bit preachy.  I'm curious what your background with WoW emulation is, having read the points you chose to emphasize most.  Not to be critical, just as a suggestion for further revisions, I'd like to share some of my experience with you.  I feel that you've drastically understated the importance of a team with skilled and dedicated developers.  To anyone thinking of running a server: you can't do it alone.  Can't.  You absolutely must put a team together, even if you are just running a stock emulator, you'll quickly realize how staggering the workload is for one person.  Division of labor is essential.  

Your team needs at the very least one *extremely* capable C++ developer if you want to have even a chance at fixing many of the core emulator bugs that come with a stock emu.  If you're happy just running stock with all the problems, you can just merrily script away and pretend group loot works fine, but beautifully scripted encounters are just shiny paint on rotten wood if you can't fix the underlying problems.  This person is going to be angry most of the time, trying to fix bugs which are stock to MaNGOS/TC/etc., but also should be responsible for checking over the code of everyone working below them, at least until some serious trust is built up.

A SQL wizard is a very useful team member as well, since you'll run into many, many issues which are quick and easy fixes for a SQL pro.  Your lead developer is probably really good with SQL too, but he or she is busy yanking out their hair and trying to fix group loot right now.  Having a person who can just work on the database will relieve a lot of development stress, as the lead dev now just has to review the SQL patches instead of writing them him or herself.

Scripters are great.  You need them, too.  People who know ScriptDev2, or lua, or C++, or AI_Agents, or some custom AI, whichever method (or combination thereof) you choose to use.  You can teach just about anyone to script basic mobs, which is good because there are a lot of them, but you also have to make time to check their work since tedious, repetitive work like that is a breeding ground for copy/paste errors (as I know from personal experience).  Point is, your lead dev is still fighting with that group loot bug, and he or she is not going to want to waste their time on scripting Burning Blade Acolytes, so you need at least one person dedicated to writing scripts.  Again, the lead dev (or a scripting lead if your team is big enough) is still going to want to review scripts before they go live.

You're going to need a network guy.  As soon as your server goes live, you can expect people to try to hack it, crash it, and DDOS it.  With Crestfall, we haven't even released and we still face regular DDOS attacks to our forums.  Fortunately our network engineer knows his stuff and has done a great job keeping us online.  I don't know how he does it, that's his job as the network admin, but if you want to make a server, you want one of those guys.  You can get hardware yourself that helps protect against these kinds of attacks too, and most good hosting companies have it available, but either way it costs extra.  Be prepared to pay for decent uptimes.

Your team is going to need trustworthy GMs, and trustworthy community managers.  The nature of WoW private servers means finding people who are multilingual for this is a real bonus.  As if it wasn't hard enough to find trustworthy people in the first place.

Lastly, researchers.  There is a wealth of reliable information on WoW out there, regarding loot, AI, scripts.. just about everything.. but it requires a good filter for rubbish, a strong understanding of the game and it's mechanics, and a tremendous amount of time.  Your other staff members are going to be busy as heck just trying to make the server work, and when a quest isn't working right, it's much easier for a developer to just ask someone reliable to come up with a detailed description of what it's supposed to do than roll off and do it themselves.  

As a final and unrelated note, it's probably worth putting in there something about what to do when Blizzard sends you a Cease and Desist order.",2016-07-17 23:12:13+00:00,d5g5p9m,1.0,t3_4taj1b,21476.0,wowservers

85,"Asura could give you a better answer, but effectively, the things that most servers can't fix are MaNGOS issues and limitations.  Without massively changing their emulator, they can't fix them, and many devs simply don't have the expertise to do it.  Or they can't risk bringing down a server that's been live for years in the attempt.  There isn't much that can't be fixed if you step outside the MaNGOS box.

The core is a ""Ship of Theseus"" Ascent backport we rebuilt system by system as a hobby for around four years before getting somewhat more serious last year.  Rewriting our own rewrites to continually add more functionality and supporting all that functionality throughout.  That's how we avoid the MaNGOS stock bugs, and that's how we go from Vanilla to TBC to Wrath and beyond.  The support for things like phasing and that is already present in the core, even though we don't need it for Vanilla.

Is there a guaranteed timeline for expansions?  Of course not.  We have to generate thousands of NPC scripts, loot tables, events, quests, etc.  That takes time.  We made tools for ourselves to expedite the process, but no matter how much you automate, creating and testing that is going to be a huge undertaking.  I'm still sitting on a list of about 300 NPCs, 75 quests, and a couple dozen events that need scripting prior to Vanilla launch, along with a host of spell fixes, and other things we want to implement or improve inside the emulator itself.  

Good news is, by the time we launch, those will be done, so our content creation resources can turn to TBC content.  So no, TBC content has not been scripted in advance in terms of it being done before we launch Vanilla, but we'll start working on it as soon as Vanilla is ready to go.

87,"Good question.  :D The emulator is capable of handling TBC, Wrath, etc.  It will just be a matter of scripting npcs, events, and generating loot tables.  Grunt work.  Not difficult, just time consuming and tedious.  So no, we aren't really worried about it.",2016-04-12 23:09:36+00:00,d20gsil,2.0,t1_d20glzr,290.0,wowservers

89,"Understood.  Just bear in mind that Vanilla is largely done.  Further expansion handling is already built into the core, it's just a matter of adding content.  It's slow and tedious work, but it's actually easier since the data is more readily available.  We also don't anticipate having to launch expansion after expansion in rapid fashion.  For now we're focused on 1.12, but we're building the emulator with an eye to the future.  Tbh, thinking about 4.0 isn't even in my mind.  I'm focused on what we're doing and taking things as they come.  It'll be a big day when I can switch my efforts off 1.12 and start working on TBC content creation.",2016-04-12 17:28:31+00:00,d201lal,2.0,t1_d201b7f,359.0,wowservers
90,"In most cases, we're just going to go with the 1.12.1 versions of things.  Some items and loot tables (Adding Helm of the Lifegiver to Alliance tables comes to mind) will be reverted to older versions on a case-by-case basis, but that's the way they'll stay from launch.  As the guy who would be responsible for managing a patch-by-patch re-itemization effort, I can say with certainty that I don't want to do it.",2016-04-12 17:23:36+00:00,d201czn,6.0,t1_d200ir7,1071.0,wowservers

92,"Yeah, those were mostly just demos for staff.  We have a guy making videos for us now, so you'll see stuff with improved quality and frequency as we go forward from here.  The main work right now is background stuff, so there isn't much to show in-game, but create big improvements in stability and efficiency.  Once a few more systems are rebuilt we'll be focusing a lot more on in-game content, and there will be more to show.",2016-04-12 17:08:57+00:00,d200o6x,2.0,t1_d200b47,468.0,wowservers
93,"Well.. There has been talk about having donations for vanity items you cannot get through normal means.  Ie. TGC rewards, blizzcon pets, etc.  Or if you want the old version of a mount you already have, ie. armorless epic horses, then that would be a potential as well.  Point is, no gear, no tradeskill items, no levels, no professions, etc.  No game-affecting stuff.",2016-04-12 16:53:29+00:00,d1zzy74,3.0,t1_d1zzshg,201.0,wowservers
94,"Good suggestion.  We've been bantering around with this same idea a little bit, but haven't come to a full decision on it.  Too much other stuff going on.  That said, when the time comes we'll be polling for community opinion on this kind of thing.  I agree that some major events are worth a second take.  :D",2016-04-12 16:29:43+00:00,d1zyuxk,2.0,t1_d1zxnnj,1569.0,wowservers
95,"This refers to people on our PvE and PvP servers being able to play BGs with each other, even though they'll never see each other anywhere else.  Depending on the population of each one, that may or may not even matter, but it's a nice function to have if the demand is there.  If a PvE server is severely underpopulated, for example, then they'll have a tough time doing BGs without it.",2016-04-12 16:19:49+00:00,d1zyehf,2.0,t1_d1zy0fh,505.0,wowservers
96,"In terms of talents, 1.12.1.  It's the best balanced and most stable.  In terms of instanced and ""special world content"" like Darkmoon Faire, we'll be following a progression similar to retail, though Battlegrounds will likely be available from launch.

Edit:  This means delayed releases of BWL, ZG, AQ, etc, along with their associated content.  Meaning that the Zandalar Tribe won't be there until ZG is released.  The islands will be, the map data stays the same and we don't want to client edit stuff, but the NPCs won't be there until they are ""current"" with the rest of the content.  I hope that makes sense.",2016-04-12 16:05:59+00:00,d1zxrle,2.0,t1_d1zxfpz,433.0,wowservers
97,"I'm thinking we'll make copies of the Vanilla characters on the perma-Vanilla server, maybe if requested, maybe by default.  There will be a ""transition date"" where the realm is changed over to TBC, retaining the character db as it stands on that date.  A copy of that could be created and maintained on a new realm which will always be Vanilla.  If you want to stay playing Vanilla, then that's fine.  If your guild wants to finish a few things up before jumping up to TBC, that's also fine.  I suspect there will be a method created to transfer characters from lower realms to higher realms past the ""transition date"", but we haven't discussed that internally yet.

Some of this stuff is still in the air, and of course we reserve the right to change our minds prior to launch, but this should give you the general idea of what we're looking at.",2016-04-12 14:50:28+00:00,d1zudo3,1.0,t3_4eg7cl,3025.0,CrestfallServer
98,"I'll post when I'm going to do a session.  Maybe set up a regular thing.  I have a full time job and my schedule is weird this week, so I'll put another update out on the weekend.

99,"What's funny about this is that even the OP contains multiple lies.  One, the ""slipping updates"" were completely addressed, in advance, in an update which he didn't read, with Reaper saying that they would miss two updates due to their Bones III campaign.  Updates resumed on time, as promised.  Secondly, the discount on the book *was* mentioned in an update, that again, he just didn't read, despite his claims.

The mess with the refund percentage was due to a disgruntled employee who has since been fired (in the CAV comments, Reaper specifically referred to the ""remaining"" CSRs having been informed and educated about the issue here).

So the problem here is 90% OP, 10% former employee.  This company has been great for years, so we'd all better lose our minds due to a single problem caused by a bad hire that was rectified within 24 hours.  Zzz.  The sense of entitlement here is real.",2015-09-09 23:21:03+00:00,cuw66vv,1.0,t3_3k5gdb,89798.0,boardgames
