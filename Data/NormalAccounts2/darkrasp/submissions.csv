As promised I was out of town this weekend and didn't get as much done as I would have liked.  I've also been putting a lot of time into answering questions on the forums.  I still haven't gotten around to adding onto the FAQ with some of the more recent questions, but I'll get to it in the next day or two.

Despite all the distraction, I did manage to finish off all the Maraudon NPCs, Sunken Temple NPCs, and about 2/3 of the trash mobs in Blackrock Depths, but allow me to clarify that a little bit.  Maraudon is more or less ready for testing, the only things I haven't yet figured out is how to spawn Celebras the Redeemed and Zaetar, following the defeat of Celebras the Cursed and Princess Theradras, respectively.  Forcing them to spawn by just creating the creature in script is easy, but like I said in my last update, I prefer to use the in-game mechanics whenever possible.  Just haven't been able to nail down the precise spells used for those yet.  Worst comes to worst, we'll do it through script and nobody but us will know the difference.  Noxxion is another one giving me fits, since he has a dummy effect custom spell we have to create a spell script for.  When Noxxion creates his spawns, he does a death animation where he turns into his shackles and becomes untargetable.  Once all five of his spawns are destroyed, he pops back up and resumes fighting.  Most private servers handle this with some form of the Banish spell, even on retail it was massively buggy, so we'll have to see how it goes.  I'm confident we can get it working nice, but it'll take some work.  I'm escalating it to Asura because it's beyond my capacity to write spellfixes.

Sunken Temple is along the same lines.  NPCs all use spells more-or-less correctly.  Testing is gonna be necessary to tune things but it's not too bad.  I haven't done Jammal'an the Prophet or the Avatar of Hakkar event yet.  Those are going to take a bit of trouble.  Atal'arion's statue event also needs doing.  Otherwise so far so good.

Obviously we don't intend to launch with these kinds of things still not working.  Our content creation process just kind of flows along these lines.  I go through a zone or instance and generate all the content that I can, mostly NPC scripts (""scripts"" is kind of a misnomer since fully 95% of our mobs are handled in database, not script, but people tend to think of them as scripts, so for ease of understanding that's the nomenclature I'm sticking with).  When there are events or NPCs that are beyond my ability, I do the research on applicable gameobjects, dummy spells, and produce detailed instructions on how the event or NPC should function.  The annoying grunt work finished, Asura can quickly produce quality content, or determine if the AI or scripting engines require additional functionality, which he adds in himself as necessary.

Quests are something we've only scratched the surface of.  While the scripting engine was built with them in mind, and we have the ability to script pretty much any quest we can think of, we just haven't gotten around to many of them.  When we start bringing in testers in (or around) June, one of their major tasks will be generating quality notes and instructions on how the quests will work, so that we can write that content and plug it into the server.  Most of the time spent between the start of public testing and release will be spent on content creation and difficulty tuning.  The quicker we can get through it, the sooner we launch.

One of the forum suggestions was that we provide more insight into the core in our updates.  We haven't really gotten together and discussed fully what the state of the emulator is in.  As mentioned before we have several people working on different aspects of the emulator simultaneously, working different schedules on different continents, so it is difficult to keep everyone informed on exactly what is happening.  We're hashing out how we want to do updates and create a ""progress bar"" that will show what things are done, what is being worked on, and what still needs doing.  Hopefully in the next couple weeks things will become a lot more clear for everyone.

What I can tell you is that work has continued on AI, especially pet AI, and that Asura redid something to do with liquids so that players' breath works properly, and lava damages you properly.  You can even time your jumps to avoid most of the lava damage, just like retail, for those of you who remember firewalking to Ragnaros.

Anyways, I'm going to wrap this up because it's getting on.  We expect to start doing videos in the next week so future updates should include video content.  As far as livestreaming goes, unless something goes terribly wrong I intend to livestream some work on Friday, probably a couple hours work on instance NPCs, starting around 4pm GMT at twitch.tv/darkrasp.  There won't be much ingame, just code, but pop by if you have any questions you want to ask.",CrestfallServer,Darkrasp's Update 4/25/2016,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrestfallServer/comments/4ggp05/darkrasps_update_4252016/

That's a decent day for me and it lets me update with weekend progress.

Anyways, this week in Content Creation saw Uldaman and Maraudon NPCs more or less completed.  Events haven't really been touched yet because I'm pretty ignorant, but the bad guys use their abilities at least.  We'll go back and hammer out events and special little things when all the core work is complete, for now things can still change with the scripting engine so it's best not to get into to much stuff that might have to be changed later.

One thing I want to talk about briefly is Archaedas, just because I don't think many places get it right.  It's interesting to poke through the list of spells in the game because it gives some insight into how they wrote the events in the first place and what kind of mechanics retail was using at the time.  Archaedas is particularly interesting because he has nearly a dozen spells, most of which have no direct effect, but define his interactions with the adds in that fight.  He'll cast area spells targeting adds, and they are programmed to respond appropriately when hit by those spells, whether it's forcing one of them to unfreeze, or despawning them on a wipe, or forcing them to suicide if he's successfully killed.  

Nefarian actually does many of the same things, from spells which pick which colors of Drakonid you're going to fight that week, to spells which create Drakonid Skeleton gameobjects, and then different spells that interact with those gameobjects, forcing them to despawn in case of a wipe, or force them to spawn the undead drakonids that come when he hits 20%.  

Many of the scripts I've seen in the past make no use of this, opting to just directly force NPCs to spawn or despawn, using custom code to push through events.  Kind of strange when the code is already in the game.  Mining this stuff up and making use of the original mechanics are part of the fun of researching and writing content.  Of course many of these spells are Dummy spells, meaning they call a spell script (which we have to create), but even in those cases you can get a good feel for what they were intending on retail and recreate it authentically, a reward in itself.

So, enough blabber.  I'm going to do a little bit more work on Celebras and Theradras, then move on to Sunken Temple.  I'm out of town next weekend so we'll see how much gets done, but I'm hoping to have ST done and be ready to start on Blackrock Depths by next week.  Probably no livestream because again, out of town, but I'll do one of those in the next couple weeks and answer some questions if anyone has anything to ask.

31,2016-04-12 00:04:16+00:00,self.CrestfallServer,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrestfallServer/comments/4edk10/darkrasps_update_4112016/,False,"Just an update for today.  I figure I should throw these out every so often from here on out.  Maybe I'll decide on a regular schedule for it, but winging it for now.  

Asura lost our SFK and Deadmines scripts.  It happens, there's a lot of moving parts here.  I tend to keep copies of everything, he tends not to, and since he did those ones on his own, I don't have backups of them.  I usually do, but my copies were old junk from an old scripting engine we don't use anymore.  Point is, my job for today was re-writing the SQL queries for all the trash mobs today.  They're ready for testing.  Bosses get done soon, events a little later.

We've been going back and forth on whether the bosses should be handled in SQL or in script.  Basically running stuff out of the database is ""nice"".  It's easy to change on the fly, and it's pretty efficient.  The handler Asura has written is pretty powerful so we can do *almost* everything with regard to NPC AI from the database that we an do with script.  For a while my job has been converting all the scripts over to database for all the world mobs, and I'm doing that for instance mobs now as well.  We decided though that bosses would be kept in script to give us maximum flexibility for changing them later.  Something I didn't think of but Asura reminded me, this is intended to be a progression realm, and those bosses can change from expansion to expansion.  Script isn't quite as nice because you have to recompile it where db you can just make a change and reboot the server, but whatever.  Once they're tested and tuned nicely, we won't have to worry much about recompiling unless it's time to launch an expansion, which will be a mammoth task anyways so what's one more compile? ;)

Alright, so Deadmines and SFK trash are re-done today.  A few of the minibosses got re-scripted (I did say we were going back and forth) in BFD, Gnomer and RFC.  I started working on RFD as well, did all the trash, Amnennar, Mordresh, and Glutton.

Effectively, I do all the NPCs.  As much as I can.  I'm kind of support staff here, I'm no code warrior so I'm relegated largely to grunt work.  I can do *most* things, then what I can't do goes up to Asura.  He whips out the more complex content to finish up a trickier script, and then we're ready to test.

Hmm, what else?  That's about it for now.  Everything is done as far as I can take it up to about level 40 in terms of instances.  For World NPCs on EK/Kalimdor, they're all finished and awaiting testing and tuning.  Kazzak is done, Azuregos and the Green Dragons are mostly done, but I haven't figured out how to make the anti-zerg debuff work and it isn't high enough priority at the moment for Asura to bother with it.  We'll get to that when we're closer to launch.  My plan for the next week is to finish up RFD and continue plugging along with instances.

We have a rewrite of the loot system coming too.  Our current loot system is this old piece of junk where each npc has a table of every item it can possibly drop and they all roll independently.  Most of them have hilariously small drop percentages, but in theory you could have a mob drop like 90 items, or zero items.  In practice it works out ok but it's sloppy and ugly and inefficient.  The loot grouping system you see on some servers works better, but still not perfect.  It's great for bosses, but meh for world npcs.  Just not particularly efficient still.  Our idea is taking the groups a bit farther and using a mix and match of templates.  I researched exactly what an NPC *can* drop.  How many of each kind of item, what are the odds of a Lockbox or Tigerseye, trade goods, consumables, how many of each kind can an NPC possibly drop, and what is the max number of items an NPC can carry?

Anyways, after a lot of long and boring work, it's all more or less figured out.  We can chop up every NPCs loot into a set of smaller tables with a weighting system that dynamically aligns itself to the NPC's level, producing accurate ilevel drops off the correct level of NPC.  The right items, with the right chances, in the right quantities.  Only trouble is, someone is going to have to build those hundreds of tables, and that someone is, unfortunately, me.  Sigh.  Well, nobody ever said doing things the hard way was glamorous, but if you want something done right, do it myself, I guess.  :D

Oh, and no, I'm not the only one working on this.  Asura is plugging away at some sort of database thing I don't understand.  It's way over my head, but my understanding is that he's effectively making the emulator expansion-ready.  We aren't going to make three separate emulators as we progress towards Wrath, the emulator we run 1.12.1 on will be equally capable of running 3.3.5, so it supports phasing, flying, all that junk.  We have a couple full time testers, another guy working on the database, and a lua programmer working on quests.  I think.  If he isn't busy being a slacker layabout like usual.

That's all for now.  I'll probably check back in a week or so.  If anyone is interested, I'm thinking about streaming my scripting work.  The core development is over my head, I can watch Asura code and I haven't the foggiest idea what he's doing, but watching me script is largely self-explanatory.  Even if you don't know what all the numbers mean, it's pretty obvious to see what's going on within the script for an individual NPC.  I don't talk much but I have a decent taste in music and I'm chatty in text, as the length of this post probably makes clear.  So if you have any questions, you can fire away.

Thanks for taking the time, we'll catch up again soon.  Maybe next time I'll cut to the chase and not be so verbose.  Maybe.
