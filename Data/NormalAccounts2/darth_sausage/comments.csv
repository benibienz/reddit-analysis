16,"While I completely agree that most people's opinions of Tim Horton's are biased because of patriotism, I genuinely dislike the taste of Starbucks.

17,At this point I'd be willing to pay the money for a new mobo to fix these FPS spikes as they just completely ruin gaming not to mention if I blow the VRM on this mobo and fry my CPU I'm going to be pretty upset. I don't have the money for both a new board and CPU right now so I'm probably just going to settle with a new board.,2016-03-11 22:31:01+00:00,d0wipeq,2,t1_d0wim6o,147,buildapc
18,"Alright so I've done some research on this and it's not absolutely confirmed that this could be the case, however this could make a lot of sense. I have never gotten a steady 60fps frame rate on MMOs. Games like Archeage and World of Warcraft have always dropped FPS when many things are on the screen at once and I also remember running into a similar issue in GTA V. The other posts and forums I read say that because it's such a big world, it can't possibly pre-render these things which force it to constantly pull from the hard drive on the fly. People have reported when these fps spikes happen, the HDD is either reading large amounts or is writing to itself. I'll run a monitoring software when I get home and test and see if this is the case. If so, I suppose an SSD is the only way to go. Either way, I'll post my results here so other people can potentially benefit. 

Edit: Here's probably the most useful link I found: https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/3au5sh/can_oldslow_hdd_cause_static_low_fps_and_fps_drops/",2016-03-09 20:01:04+00:00,d0trdch,7,t1_d0t95at,30240,blackdesertonline
19,"Hey bud, try using either Raptr or the new AMD one that came with the newest driver.",2016-03-08 23:30:25+00:00,d0soo7e,2,t1_d0rcfh0,88144,blackdesertonline
20,"I would be absolutely fine with frame rate like that. That's an interesting point. I suppose, especially in an mmo where the map and everything is constantly generating and whatnot, the hdd could possibly be a factor. I'll look into that and see if I can find anything. I'll try the Display Driver Uninstaller as well and hopefully that'll give results. I'll make sure to post if it does or not in case anyone else has the same problem. Thank you very much and I totally agree, 20fps is just horrendous.

Update: I ran the Display Driver Uninstaller tool and I think it improved my FPS a little bit. I'm now getting 40-45 with it occasionally dropping down to 25ish which is still shit but it's progress. I do however have the giant fps spike to deal with still. The game completely locks up for a couple seconds every minute or so and it is incredibly annoying. Not sure how to approach this.

22,I was wondering if maybe that's the case. I was thinking of maybe reinstalling Windows 7. A fresh install is always nice in either case.,2016-03-08 17:23:55+00:00,d0s8fde,2,t1_d0s88kh,260,blackdesertonline
