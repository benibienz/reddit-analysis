So I bought Black Desert Online yesterday and I was very excited to play it. I started playing it and immediately noticed horrible fps. I looked at my fps and it was between 20-30. As well as the overall low FPS, about every minute or so the game will completely lock up for about 5 seconds and then continue. I have the graphics settings set to high, and I don't have high end mode on. I've seen people with far less specs get significantly more FPS than me and I'm getting very frustrated. I spent probably 4 hours last night researching and trying to find a solution and came up with nothing. Some people mentioned that my CPU might be a bottleneck for this game, but a buddy of mine has the same CPU with a worse GPU and his game runs significantly better. Also, completely lowering the graphics settings does basically nothing and my fps is still garbage. This is basically my last resort and I'm pretty upset that this is happening. Any help would be so much appreciated.  Thank you.

Update: After further investigation, I think the issue is my motherboard. The motherboard I have is rather low end and lacks heat sinks on the VRM. Apparently with a CPU like the fx-8350 this can generate quite a bit of heat on the VRM causing it to throttle the CPU to prevent damaging itself and this would explain the FPS spikes.

With my 280x I could get around a steady 40-50 fps in GTA V with almost everything maxed out, but I'm getting like 30-40 fps with the 390x and the same settings.

I bought an MSI 390x and I read somewhere for best results, you should always uninstall old drivers before installing the new ones. My old graphics card was the XFX 280x. So I went into control panel, programs and features, AMD Catalyst ATI, and I uninstalled all drivers like I read I was supposed to do. The drivers uninstalled and then my computer blue screened. So when I restarted it, it would just get a black screen and my computer would restart. I went into safemode and tried to install the drivers off the disk but apparently safemode won't let you install AMD drivers. So I hit ""Load last know working configuration"". This loaded windows, however none of my drivers work now. If I hit a button on the keyboard they flash briefly but nothing happens and same with my mouse. My ethernet also doesn't work. I went to ""Repair your PC"" and the Windows 7 recovery thing doesn't even recognize any harddrives in my computer and doesn't know where the windows boot is. So I loaded up Fedora and after looking in the Windows folder I can see that System32 and System are both empty. I have no clue what to do. Anything would help.
