I posted about it a while back and someone claimed to already have the update and I had him posted is software version. It was never than mine.

11,I use a Verizon version with my tmobile s7 edge and it works great. Only annoying thing is is you shut it down completely it wants to activate when you power it back on. Just a matter if pressing the x button though and it doesn't ask again until the next reboot. ,2016-06-13 00:16:50+00:00,d46nx9j,1.0,t3_4nsw6t,2771.0,GalaxyS7

14,Can anyone explain exactly how this would work if I am a brand new customer?  Would the bill be the plan + 2 monthly phone charges but I would get a gift card for the full value of one phone?  Can I then use the gift card to pay off the phone and then use cash to pay off the other and get my monthly payment back to plan only with 2 paid off phones? Thanks in advance. ,2016-05-31 21:26:42+00:00,d3qx21o,1.0,t3_4lwnek,11375.0,tmobile
