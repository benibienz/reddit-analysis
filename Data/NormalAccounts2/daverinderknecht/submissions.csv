I got one on Craigslist and don't have it activated, just using over BT but it still says I have the newest update even though it hasn't had one in a few months. Just wondering if anyone with a Verizon version for the new update that hit in July? ",GearS2,Verizon gear S2 update?,https://www.reddit.com/r/GearS2/comments/4ue5qb/verizon_gear_s2_update/

I tried the N preview then un registered my device and took the M ota to go back to stock. Today I got the ota alert that the N preview was ready to download. I looked on the site and my 6p was registered with the beta again. I unenrolled but the ota notification won't go away. Tried reboot but no help. Any idea how to get rid of the notification?
