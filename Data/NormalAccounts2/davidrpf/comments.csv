5,"Haven't seen Blade Runner so I don't know about this one 
But Room I can tell you it is a very harsh movie just a few happy moments, I would say it is a ""personal"" movie it can make you uncomfortable but not in a awkward way, maybe just like Prisioners (2014). In a theater you will feel the tension on the room so if you are looking for that kind of experience I think it is a great option. Plus if you can't see them both you can rent Blade Runner otherway you have to wait until Room releases their DVD/Blu-Ray",2016-01-31 19:54:05+00:00,cziv4g0,1.0,t3_43f3so,93323.0,whatshouldiwatch

26,"Yes I would and here's why
As a dentist you don't have many time you get paid by how many people goes to your clinic. And the more people you attend the more money you got, you need to make a schedule and that's your work. Let's say you take a 1 and half hour for the treatment, IF the patient doesn't go that's time lost. I'm still studying dental school (only 1 year left) but I can say that many many people doesn't go to their appointments. So as a dentist you can't risk that so you charge a fee even if you don't go. 
As you were saying that person has anxiety problems, he/she will have those problems anyway and the dentist can't take that time to see when is going to go to his/her appointment. 
I can't say more stuff because I don't know how to explain myself in english but I hope you understand my point of view. 

But I have to admit, $250 is way to expensive, but I guess it's in USA ",2016-01-03 23:22:23+00:00,cykvs37,1.0,t3_3yqnm2,415932.0,Dentists
