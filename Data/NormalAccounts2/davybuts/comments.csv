""He needs less pressure and better conditions for him to express his qualities.

""Yes (he is getting closer). I told him today that he is going to be involved in the game against Feyenoord. He is trying.

199,"&gt;BvS has an incredible score, iconic and emotional some might say.
Can you remember a single note of music from the supposed superhero - fantasy epic Thor 2?

Well I doubt that's what critics base good reviews on. Apart from the Wonder Woman Theme I can't really recall anything else that I found memorable from either films.

&gt;providing another investigative role that furthers the narrative?

No it doesn't, the audience already know who's behind everything, it's not like she gives us anymore insight as into why in my opinion.

&gt;Did any fight scene in Thor 2 make anyone genuinely think that main character lives were at stake? No. BvS had some real hard hitting choreography that made you wince at every blow and a main character actually died.

That's true, even though Superman stays dead as long as Loki does.

&gt;Did BvS waste the talents of iconic actors like Anthony Hopkins and Christopher Ecclestone.

Since when was Christopher Ecclestone an ""iconic"" actor and yes BvS does waste some of it's talent, Diane Lane and Kevin Costner giving the shittiest advice ever like ""You don't owe them anything"". Also all Laurence Fishburne does is complain that Clark is never where he is supposed to be and just walks around the office looking disgruntled.

&gt;boring and trivial dialogue or completely removing the need for their existence by removing both recognisable face and voice?

Because Laurence Fishburne's dialogue was riveting and putting a eye-patch over Anthony Hopkins eye make's him unrecognisable, while Ecclestone is playing the villain who is a Dark Elf so it would be a bit weird if he looked like he normally does. 

In general while nothing spectacular Thor:The Dark World is a more cohesive film. There are so much more issues with BvS, from how they completely fuck up Jimmy Olsen's character to how they introduce the Justice League to name a few. Yeah you can do the e-mail thing if you want to but was the logos necessary, now it looks like Lex designed them.

605,"Yes they are taking plot points from the comics but they won't resemble the events of the comic. 

The events that bring civilians into the crossfire are completely different. From what iv'e gathered is the conflict between Tony and Cap is more to do with Cap's reluctance to hand over the Winter Soldier over to the authorities.

Spider-Man's arc will most likely be completely different in the film as Kevin Feige has said that that since superhero secret identities do not exist in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the film will be more about world governments demanding accountability and oversight of superheroes instead of them forcibly revealing their true identity to the authorities, although Spider-Man's identity probably won't be known by the public.

There will me major players from the comics not involved in the movie due to varying reasons. Two of the main players in the comics are Mr. Fantastic and Doctor Strange, both of whom will not be in this film.  ",2016-03-21 17:01:46+00:00,d180ywa,3.0,t1_d17zie1,2030.0,movies

The way your going about it is that Keogh's father left Ireland and moved to England and forgot his heritage and raised his kids as English because that's where they where born, but that's not how it works.

The fact is he may have been born in England but he has Irish blood, he doesn't stop being Irish because he's born in a different country. Let's say you move to a foreign country (let's say America) and your kids are born there, does that mean they are American?

Just curious do you class Owen Hargreaves as an Englishman? Or to a lesser extent Raheem Sterling or John Barnes?

871,"So lets look at the main categories:

**Best Picture:** 8 of the 11 are the same, the likelihood is that both Carol and Sicario where close to being nominated for the Academy Award.

**Best lead Actor:** The exact same 5 with the addition of Johnny Depp.

**Best Lead Actress:** Same 5 with the addition of Charlize Theron

**Best Supporting Actor:** Apart from the addition of Paul Dano and Michael Shaanon and no Christian Bale the other 4 are the same.

**Best Supporting Actress:** Same 5 with the addition of Helen Mirren.

**Best Director:** 4 of the 6 are nominated for the Academy award aswell.

OP says in his comment "" A lot more diversity and almost every nominee deserved to be nominated"", but apart from the addition of a few names it's basically the same lists. 
Those additions are all white so I don't see the diversity except in categories which the Academy don't have so it's not comparable in my opinion.

886,"Well the current rules in place state that 

&gt;Work permits will only be issued to international football players of the highest calibre who will be able to make a significant contribution to the development of the game of football in the United Kingdom at the highest level.

&gt;A player must have played for his country in at least 75% of its competitive A team matches of which he was available for selection, during the two years preceding the date of the application.

Seeing as he has yet to be capped it's highly unlikely he'll be granted a permit. In the past younger players have been given special dispensation i.e Anderson to United was given a permit due to the fact he was too young to have garnered enough caps for Brazil at the time.

However Caceres is 23 and no offence to Australia, they wouldn't be seen to be on the same level of Brazil so the argument that he's too young to have gained enough caps would not be a viable argument.

Also the Permit rules are more strict these days, Rodolph Austin played for Leeds United for 3 years but was refused a work permit when he joined Sheffield Wednesday in the summer.

The lack of punctuation gives it no pause? It's 3 lines not 10 with no full stops. Starting a new sentence for every statement is repetitive and poor use of English. Using full stops between every point makes it sound more like it came from an 8 year old.

&gt;Harrison Ford gave a good performance. You could tell he really cared for the film. It also shows he cared for the character. He didn't phone it in.

Also I don't see the issue with how I used albeit. Yes I could have used although but I made the choice to use albeit as I felt it fit and doesn't look out of context in the sentence.

&gt;'Hodgson was completely out of his depth'
LOL!

He went on to say in reply to another comment

&gt;Wasn't given enough time more like. He's proved with England that he can handle top jobs.
But of course everyone hates British managers here...

When questioned about Hodgson at the world cup:

&gt;Did you watch us at the World Cup? We didn't lose because of the manager's tactics or formation, because we outplayed our opponents. We lost games due to individual errors, which is something the manager cannot be accounted for. The only mistake Hodgson made at the World Cup was playing Gerrard who wasn't in the right state of mind.
We've shone in the qualifiers and had a good Euro 2012, considering he was an unplanned replacement and had only had a few training sessions with the squad prior to the tournament.

He also said this in relation to england qualifying group, when I asked them had they really shone:

&gt;Yes, Switzerland and Slovenia were always going to be tough fixtures but we've managed to pull through.

He also posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/3nqalj/why_are_british_managers_so_underrated/) the other day where he give's out about people calling for Hodgson to be sacked and how in general british managers are underrated.

1756,"&gt;If you sadly saw Pirates 4 you may remember the ending hinted heavily at Jack Sparrow leaving to find the fountain of youth. So that would mean either the 20 year time jump didn’t happen or it took him 20 years to find the fountain. Also, it mentions Blackbeard so does that mean Ian McShane will return as Blackbeard for Pirates 5? As of right now he has not been mentioned or commented on the rumours so it seems not.

Eh is it just me or is this article all over the place, it says at the end of Pirates 4 that Jack and Barbosa embark on a quest to find the Fountain of Youth, but that was the end of the 3rd one and what the 4th movie was about. On IMBd plot summary there is no mention of the fountain of youth. This is the Pirates 5 synopsis on IMBd

&gt;Jack is back! On this fifth installment of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, Jack's luck has run out. It seems that Captain Salazar (Bardem) has released the most deadly ghost pirates of the sea from the devil's Triangle. Captain Salazar is the oldest villain of Jack Sparrow. The ghost pirates hunt on every single pirate on the sea, including Jack Sparrow. The only hope to survive this adventure is to collect the legendary Trident of Poseidon. This weapon is the most powerfull weapon and the owner gets control of all seas. Is Jack going to collect this powerfull weapon and can he insure he is not going to get killed by Captain Salazar and his pirate ghosts?

In terms of our league it's on a par if not better than the welsh league and has produced more international players in recent years than the welsh domestic league. Its difficult for a league to improve when its semi-professional and the best young players are going to English youth academies as its more beneficial to them rather than staying here.",2015-07-06 10:34:50+00:00,cstonlm,6.0,t1_cstjcvj,19323.0,soccer

Currently their are 14 teams in Qatar's top flight, several teams share stadiums the majority of which have capacities of 15,000. The plan for the WC is to build or renovate between 8 to 12 stadiums all with capacities of 40,000+ and one with 85,000. After the WC what will happen to them some are being build in area's that currently don't have a team to play in them, same thing happened in Brazil built a new stadium with a capacity of over 40,000 where the closet team play in something like the 3rd or 4th division. A country that doesn't have a league that could support stadium's of this size once the WC has ended shouldn't be given a WC. Their should be some sort of infrastructure in place before a WC can be held. A country better qualified to host is Australia. Yes their league isn't the biggest but they have the infrastructure and means to support the massive stadia already in place that the majority would only have needed minor renovations. They are not reliant on the league to support the stadiums as they have many other sports that can and already do support the infrastructure in place I.e Rugby Union and League, Aussie Rule, Cricket etc.",2015-06-27 01:50:59+00:00,csk3p4n,3.0,t1_csk0hfn,6298.0,soccer

4 out of 5 where good?
