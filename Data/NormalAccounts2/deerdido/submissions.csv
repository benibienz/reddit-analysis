Get it fixed elsewhere
Replace flex cable (or other)
Or fresh reset

Firstly, I don't believe it's the flex cable - supposedly you can expose whether this is the fault by pressing hard on different parts of the phone to see if it's loose/broken. Also, because it's a black screen I cannot seem to get to the reset options. On top of this I haven't backed it up (and can't seem to because I cannot unlock the phone because of the black screen).

So, I guess the question is... Anyone got any other possible fixes? or ways to unlock my N5 so that I may back it up, and reset through my PC. 

Thanks in advance.",Nexus5,"Woke up this morning to a black screen, but apparently still functioning (black screen of death)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nexus5/comments/4fagwp/woke_up_this_morning_to_a_black_screen_but/
