Not setting up any defense yet I decided to dig into the ground for shelter, since horde night was soon. Digging she gets her stuff and catches back up and helps me finish log spikes on the entrance. Day 7 was admiring our little creation and light scavenging in tree stumps. As night falls we return home prep our bows and fix our aim on the door. Dogs show up and a few spiders and come through the door and we quickly put them down but nothing else happens. Moments later we see ground falling above us. To our surprise they were digging in! (We did no research before hand wanting this all to be a learning experience) we run out but my wife glitches on a body and goes the top of the ground where the zombies were!

Had a game last night where me and a random carry dominated. I chose Athena seeing my random Carry choose Medusa (Dirty combos &amp;lt;3)
We get several kills early, feeding as many as possible to her and our jungle. Mid and solo had slight feeding to the opposing team, so once we got tier one we started roaming together and shortly after laning phase something clicked in my head, ""we need to get ahead, and you can tank almost anything right now."" So for the first time ever playing Smite instead of following I started using VgS to shot call and the team followed without hesitation. We went to Gold and burned it quick taking a tier two and Phoenix before being met with opposition. After they stole FG from us the first time it was a large team fight that amazes me that Medusa and myself survived. 1/2 health gone relying only on 3 pots and the healing of Stone of Gaia I dove into the fray taunting to get my team out. I dash to escape and here comes medusa ult and some cover fire to which they push on her the rest of my team is backed and healing by this point and all I thought was ""Dammit, Medusa, I'm doing this to get you out!"" But every time I'd dive to peel for Medusa she'd turn right back around and help me. How we kill 2 and force 2 more to back with FG buff is by some higher power of the smite gods, but a bit of defense a good herc pluck and great team fighting and listening to my first time calling shots we manage to snowball into a FG and a well fought victory.

(Can be Tl;dr)
Post game I messaged the medusa ""GG I kept on diving and taunting to get you out, did it so much our solo heard me kinda rage at you lol""
And the reply I got touched my heart and I never want to play any other role again. ""Carries care for their supports too. &amp;lt;3"" I legit teared up XD.
