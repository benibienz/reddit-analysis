What happens when you are unable to sustain that momentum and you burn out?

Working out and living healthy is a lifetime commitment that requires a complete lifestyle change. You do not get fit by hitting the gym for 2 months then stopping. What happens when you get busy and start losing interest? If that's the case you may be better if you can consistently hit the gym twice a week for the next 5 years.

Like others have mentioned, focus on proper nutrition first. I would avoid using the word diet as it is very widely misunderstood. Eat whole, healthy food. Focus on your macros. Avoid junk food, sugary drinks, soda, alcohol etc. Drink only water.

Know that this won't be easy. For some people it is easier to go to the gym than to control their nutrition. For some it is easier to say, I'll just hit ths gym for 1 hour than to resist that big, fat, juicy burger. So you have to find a way to reward yourself for your hard work. Take breaks once in a while.

If you can sustain that for at least 6 months you should see big changes without even setting foot in the gym.

* High cost of electricity

* High tax rate = possible effect on compensation
* Poor Internet = affects productivity (especially when working remotely)

These are factors that will not change overnight, so do consider these in your cost of doing business.

On the flip side, you get:

* Excellent English skills
* Quality IT talent at par with IN
* PH are more submissive compared to other cultures (subjective - my personal observation)

Let's take pecs which is fast twitch dominant. 

Taking your recommendation that would be in the 4-6 rep range, going heavy.

Would benching 1 set of 4-6 reps per week be enough to achieve maximum hypertrophy? How about benching 3x4-6 (12-18 reps total) once per week? Or doing more volume i.e. 4 chest exercises per week at 3x4-6 reps (48-73 reps total)?

I think t-nation suggests 24-50 reps per week for maximum hypertrophy, so I find your 4-6 reps quite low.",2016-04-07 07:53:44+00:00,d1ta9dt,5.0,t1_d1t986r,3395.0,Fitness
448,"Thank you for the detailed answer and the reference. Very informative.

I find it strange that you are able to come up with an optimal rep range for maximum hypertrophy (4-8) but  not the total volume per week, so I'm not sure we understand each other.

Are you saying 4-8 reps per week should be enough to induce maximum hypertrophy as long as tension is also at maximum?

As a concrete example, let's say I am shooting to optimize chest hypertrophy.

Would doing benching 4-8 reps per week at, say, 80 percent of 1rm be sufficient to achieve this goal (assuming 80 percent is optimal for tension)?",2016-04-07 04:21:45+00:00,d1t5dnx,3.0,t1_d1sll94,29002.0,Fitness

638,"Okay, I am not an expert on relationships, I have been through similar situations as the one you described, except from a guy's vantage point. I have also been with with girls with trust issues.

Here's my 2 cents.

Not to rub it in but you were most likely in the wrong. That said, I understand why you reacted that way. Most likely, he means a lot to you. Have you apologized yet?

He had the right to react that way. If you were in his place, and you accused him of thinking of cheating, how would you react? Were you expecting him to just say ""okay"" and not fight back? If he did that, you would most likely not accept it and you would keep pressing (due to your trust issues) so you'd still end up fighting.

Get some rest, eat some good comfort food - not the healthy stuff. Go for ice cream, pizza, burgers. Then tell your boyfriend you love him and that you're sorry and want him back - because obviously that's the reason you just posted a huge wall of text all about him ;)

If he doesn't accept you then maybe he was not really into you and was only looking for a reason to break up, and it's time to move on.",2015-11-16 16:27:53+00:00,cx26eaj,3.0,t1_cx25nuk,1170.0,Assistance

The birthday cake is real and in my experience, quite consistent. Never ate nor even touched it though. Bags of goods containing canned goods and rice are distributed every Christmas. You get a decent burial for the dead. Seniors get free movies.

Me and some members of my family received a yellow card which entitled us to free health care at OsMak (Ospital ng Makati). Though OsMak is relatively inaccessible to us we were able to use the yellow card a number of times. My cousin received virtually free surgery for fractured orbital bone.

It is generally a good life for Makati residents, but nothing spectacular, especially since I grew up in Marikina where the City's residents are also relatively well taken care of.

714,"Where are you staying?

Lots of foodie joints in Quezon City scout area, just get an Uber going there, talk to the driver and pick your poison.

I once brought my European friend to Romulo Cafe in Makati (they also have a branch in Quezon City scout area). Good Filipino Food, great ambiance. Also the ambiance tells a bit of Philippine history as it was started by the grand-children of Carlos P. Romulo, a Filipino statesman in the 1940s-50s. Lots of photos.

I brought my Singaporean friend to Wildflour in Makati since it's near her place and she loved it. She asked for a place where locals eat and I suggested she try sisig at Gerry's, which can be found in most malls.

For variety you can try buffet like Vikings, Niu at SM Aura, or Dad's, or Yakimix. They have a bit of everything and you won't be disappointed with the Filipino selection.

If you are more of a risk taker and want to try local food look no further than the sidewalks for vendors that sell balut, tokneneng (fried egg), isaw (chicken intestines), pares (beef stew), tapa or tapsilog (fried beef jerky with rice and egg).

Okay that's a lot, so if you're still undecided just go to Romulo's or Niu. Hope that helps.",2015-10-14 13:09:02+00:00,cvzc7be,1.0,t3_3op4uv,17936.0,Philippines

807,"You can't scrimp on a laptop. Unlike a desktop upgrading hardware can be difficult to impossible. Based on the three choices you gave I would go with the Chi. A little pricey but you are paying a premium for portability.

I'm sure there are cheaper laptops out there that can outperform the Chi. There are too many choices but your primary concern here should be CPU, RAM, and Hard Drive.

CPU: At least quad core i5-4570
RAM: At least 4GB RAM (8GB is ideal)
HDD: Get one with at least 128 GB SSD
