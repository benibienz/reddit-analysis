It is trying to chew it's way through one of the wooden gaps and I have maybe 5 hours or so before it succeeds, maybe less (I am not a rat so I would not know). 

So I would like to ask the rat termination experts out there: Aside from getting a platoon of numerous cats, how do I get rid of this guy for good? 

If you happen to be a highly intelligent, hungry, and maybe rabies-infested rat, how do I end your existence without endangering my own?

Everything unfolded in front of me and I was powerless to stop it. He even did this quick pause as if to taunt me.

I have been doing some research on how to get rid of rodents and nothing seems feasible for such a large creature.

BE VERY SCARED FILIPINOS

Duterte's Special Power of Attorney (SPA) says:

""To request for and receive, from the Bank of Philippine Islands, Julia Vargas Avenue, Pasig City Branch, bank certificates for BPI saving account No. 2433-0695-39 (the Bank Account) to show the current ballance as well as the fact that at no time since the opening of the aforesaid Bank Account was there a deposit either singly or collectively of two hundred eleven million pesos (P211,000,000.00).""

That, ladies and gentlemen, is a clever SPA that should repulse and insult Filipino voters. It does not open Duterte's account and reveal the transaction history. He is hiding something. Filipinos should be scared. If he will be president and in power, he can do this kind of duplicity and chicanery called ""palusot"" in the vernacular. We should really be scared to empower a crafty, devious politician like Duterte

For example:

If in January 2014 Duterte deposited 150 million, in February he deposited 50 million, in March he withdrew 20 million, and in April, he deposited 11 million, that SPA is not applicable, even though there was a total of 211 million pesos deposited. Reason? No single or collective deposit (as in multiple checks plus cash deposited all at once) of 211 million . Also, no 211 million appearing as balance since there was a withdrawal of 20 million in March. I weep for my country. 

2014 Transaction History 9 (example):

150 M - deposit in January
150 M - balance in January
50 M - deposit in February
200 M - balance in February
- 20 M - withdrawal in March
180 M - balance in March
11 M - deposit in April 
191 M - balance in April

Do you want to be fooled by Duterte when he is already in power and handling billions of pesos? If he is honest and not fearful of his offence, he will reveal his bank account transaction history. As a Filipino, I definitely feel intellectually insulted. Duterte must have thought that all Filipinos are like his dumb, gullible, supporters. Be very scared, Filipino voters. Be very scared. The man is shady and sketchy.
