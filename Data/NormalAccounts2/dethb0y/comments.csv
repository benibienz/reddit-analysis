My mother had the best counters i've ever used, and they were just planks of 1X6's that were heavily stained. They held up great and you could polish'em to a gleam if you had a mind to, and they matched the rest of the kitchen's woodworking.

Like, you're out in the forest at a big park a few hours from home, right? Taking a nice day hike. That's pretty mundane. Then a big dog starts following you. It doesn't bark. It doesn't chase you. It just follows you, staying like thirty feet back. It even has a collar on. That's creepy: where's it's owner? why's it following you?

Scary is when the same dog shows up following you at home. When you see it in the parking lot at work. When you see it down the street. 

Terrifying is when it's been following you and you notice it gets closer every day - and no one else sees it when you point it out.

This plays to NK's strengths (loyal military, beaten populace, and ruthless leadership, tightly controlled press) and downplays it's disadvantages (low income, poor technological base, and technologically advanced enemies).

I find it difficult to believe that two adult men could gain access to the high school and plant the letters there - or for that matter, know which locker was his to plant them, let alone his girlfriend etc's.

Almost certainly this was some high school kids who killed him, but the why of that is pretty perplexing. Did any of the kids he went to school with go on to commit other violent crimes? Were any of them weirdos? Into asphyxiating their partners using objects instead of their hands? Whoever did this clearly knew him and was part of town life, and i can't imagine them living the rest of their lives like good citizens, drawing no attention to themselves. 

As a lifelong ohioan, i can also attest: most local PD's in small towns are not very good, and them handing the case to the sheriff to handle is usually construed as a good thing because it means there's actually real police working on it. For a taste of small-town ohio policing: my neighbor had a break-in while their 17 year old daughter was home, and *saw* the burglar. The cops showed up and asked her if she recognized the guy (not a photo line up or anything - just literally ""do you know the guy you saw?"") When she said no, they told her there was likely nothing they could do, and to lock their doors. Same thing happened when my car got broken into: he intimated to me that he had ""an idea"" who was doing it (there'd been two dozen car breakin's in a month!) but there was no way to catch him unless someone literally caught him in the act!

458,"I could see there being a few reasons but the biggest is that the mythology is well known to most people, and so easy to riff off of.

For example, look at Pacific Rim. Pacific Rim lays out an entirely new mythology for a film: creatures from another dimension, etc etc. We don't know what to expect from those creatures, so they have to show us (in painstaking detail) what kind of things they are (they can't teleport; they can't phase through buildings. They don't carry guns. There's only big ones not little ones, etc).

but if i tell a story about a person possessed by a demon - i don't need to do ANY of that. We all ""know"" what a demon is like, how it works, etc and much more of the film can be spent exploring the story rather than explaining the creature. 

And of course, sometimes this is fun to invert, to: we all ""know"" angels are the good guys, but what if they were really the bad guys? What if what we think is a demon possessing someone is actually something entirely different? 

But i think really it just boils down to it being an easy short-hand way to introduce plot and character without requiring a lot of exposition.

My personal stance is this: if someone (anyone) were to have that much power, it's only a matter of time until the begin to abuse it, and only a matter of time (possibly very short) until they engage in an activity we'd consider to be assault or rape. 

For that matter, it's likely that they'd be guilty of a crime the moment they used the power: people would be falsely imprisoned. If touched, that's assault (they cannot, after all, grant consent to be touched). If any of that touching is sexual, then it's going to quickly meet the criteria for rape of an incapacitated person.

1. How common are mythological entities in the twilight universe? In one small town there's both a group of werewolves and a group of vampires.

3. What does the vampire council do in it's downtime? Like, what are their actual duties when their not showing up to dick with Bella and her crew?

4. What do vampires do during wars or other major conflicts? Like, what were the vampires of europe doing during WW2 or WW1?

507,"Super-durability. Not like superman, but just much tougher than an ordinary person. A shot from a .22 wouldn't much bother you, but a shot from a .308 would likely kill you and *definitely* give you a serious injury (like a normal person hit by a .22).

This is the shittiest of all possible super powers, and here's why: You're never *quite* good enough, but you're good enough to be useful.

So what happens? You go out to stop a bank robbery. You gotta drive there, you can't fly or run super fast or any of that. You just drive. You get there, they start blasting away at you with guns. It hurts, bad. You're hurt as bad as a normal person getting hit with a hammer, but you're getting hit several times a minute and you can't run super fast or jump on top the building or what have you. You gotta just beef it and hope they don't get you in/through the eye.

You complete the task, stopping the robbery, handing over the punks to the cops, and you're alive and bruised to shit but not dead or critically injured. You could, in theory, keep going. So you do, because you're a hero, damnit, and it's your job to keep the world safe.

The police scanner in your car (you ain't got super hearing, son) tells you there's a chase in progress. You join the chase, because maybe you could be useful. Picture this scene, for a moment - you're bleeding a little, you're bruised, you just want to lay down somewhere but nope, you're half-ass participating in a police chase in an unmarked vehicle. 

The dickwad running from the cops wrecks, and runs. You chase after him, but, again: you're just a guy who can take a hit, you can't outrun this athletic, uninjured 20-something criminal. He gets away. The cops are friendly to you (and one gives you some aspring. Good Guy Cop.) and tell you that you can't catch them all, some get away, etc. They kind of resent you because you aren't much afraid of being hurt, but they also kind of pity you because you're just a dude.

You go back to your apartment and go to sleep, and know that the next day the bruises will still be there (you don't super-heal, kiddo) and the criminals will also still be there. You're more than human, you HAVE to help, but every day it gets just a little bit harder, a little bit more miserable.

686,"Though this is not yet fully fleshed out (for reasons that should be obvious):

When there were too many human beings alive in the galaxy - a number somewhere between 3-4 trillion - a massive psionic shockwave hit everyone, everywhere, at the same time. No one was safe and no one was unaffected.

Most people fell over dead instantly; this comprised nearly 75% of the population. Others became fixated on the singular goal of destroying technology: anything from space ships to computers to hand-held communicators; they were single-minded, vicious, and determined in their goal, incapable of meaningful communication or long-term planning, little more than animals. These made up around 10% of the population. The remaining 15% suffered a sort of mental breakdown, characterized by mood swings, memory loss (both temporary and permanent), hallucinations and delusions.

Once it was all said and done, the entire human empire lay in total ruins. Entire solar systems were wiped out entirely, and most planets - once all was said and done - had suffered greater than 99% fatalities. Nearly every AI of any power had been destroyed, and most worlds had been reasonably well stripped of major technology. 

By the time my world-building picks up, it's 10,000 years later and people are really just starting to bounce back. It's common knowledge that humans had (at one point) expanded far across the galaxy. No one knows what really happened to them (though there are suspicions it was related to a psionic event). There's basically no records of that time, or much working technology from the era. That said, technology's made a serious comeback, and every day humanity expands into new worlds. sometimes - not always but sometimes - those worlds have ruins on them, remnants of some ancient culture, clearly human but very cryptic.

This isn't necessarily *how i view men*, but rather how the language of fiction tends to depict them, and working within the language of fiction is generally best when appealing to an audience. 

As for male-male interactions, i tend to keep them goal-focused, and have them discuss the matter at hand and a few pleasantries and that's it. Most of the time if two guys are together it's because their doing some activity, rather than just lingering in each other's presence. 

As to particularly horrible depictions of men in fiction, [Georgia Beer's ""Run to You""](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29993689-run-to-you) is a primer on how not to write a believable/relatable male character. Clark Breckenridge is so stereotypical and unbelievable as a character that it borders on the insulting. His thought process is simplistic and childish, and his behavior is (literally) unbelievable. Imagine a 10 year old with a penchant for grab-ass who drives a BMW, and that's Clark. Maybe that's intentional on the authors part (he's certainly a solid punching-bag) but it's still jarring that in an otherwise hyper-realistic novel.

likely, it wouldn't take very many trial runs on actual people - the procedure for opening a chest is brutal, but simple, and most of it would come down to practicing sutures and other high-skill tasks.

712,"1. Depends entirely on how the fan is affixed to the ceiling and what the ceiling is like. If it's well installed, then it might well hold the weight. If it's poorly installed, it will not. 

2. There's never a good way to test load bearing that might not destroy the fixture. Since there's very little ""tell"" when the fixture's about to fail, even adding weight in 10-pound increments wouldn't be safe. 

3. There's VERY LITTLE reporting done of failed suicide attempts, and even less information given when they are reported on. So it's probably the case that many botched hangings simply go unreported and unremarked on, or all that's known is ""they tried to hang themselves"" and they don't mention ""and ripped out the light fixture"" 

Perhaps it's interesting that in many suicides by hanging, part of the body touching the floor is common, so it may be that most suicides involving a ceiling fan do not actually have a ""drop"" per se. 

Personal anecdote: when my brother was about 5 years old, he wanted me to hold him up so he could ""play"" with the chandelier in my grandparent's living room. This he did, and ripped it out of the ceiling with basically no effort. So not everything in a house is properly mounted!

733,"There was this chick when i was a teenager, right. I was *insane* for her. So there were a few really fucked up things i did to either impress her or help her. For certain values of help. But one really stands out.

We were at a party, and someone saw the cop coming (it was a small town with only one cop on duty). so everyone but the people who lived in the house ran down into the basement to hide. We were all crouched down there while this cop is up stairs talking to the guy who lives there,and i turn to the girl and whisper in her ear:

""If he comes down here, i'll jump him. You use that opportunity to run, alright? I won't be in any trouble, i'll be fine.""

She looks at me like i have grown a 3rd fucking head, and whispers very harshly: ""Do NOT do that, do NOT."" and kind of grabs my arm.  Everyone else who heard me (maybe 2-3 of the 10 people down there) was looking at me like i was a complete lunatic. 

What's crazy is: I was totally serious. This plan leapt to my head fully formed, and i honestly saw no issue with it. Sure, the cop would kick my ass, but i wouldn't injure him, and my family could afford a lawyer. I'd probably only get probation or a few months in juvie. If it meant she could get clear, then that was totally OK by me. The cop did not come down stairs, thankfully, and after 20 minutes everything was back to normal. 

I am almost certain she never understood or comprehended the depth of my nearly psychotic devotion to her. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing. She definitely thought i was a lunatic, but kind of a lovable lunatic, i suppose.

We never dated or anything, but we did hang out quite a bit, and it was usually a pretty good time.

782,"It's really weird to be on this side of the question, because usually i'm looking at it from the other side: How can we figure out who committed this inexplicable crime? That said..

People have this impression that the police are infalliable, or that the vast majority murders are solved. This is not so: We're at about a [60% clearance rate for murder.](http://www.murderdata.org/) Do note that ""clearance"" in this case means ""handed over for prosecution"" not ""Actually convicted.""

That said, your list of requirements is sort of like saying, ""OK, if i'm a multimillionare, how do i buy a modest suburban home?"" If you leave no trace and no body and no witnesses and tell no one, of course you'd get away with it. 

The difficulty is in achieving those things, which how difficult they are to achieve is directly related to how much the police care about the case.

For example: if the case is that of a gentleman in his 30's with a drug and mental health problem, then his disappearance or death will barely raise a blip on the police radar. There is no advocacy groups calling for justice, and his family - if they still speak to him at all - are probably more resigned than outraged. 

If the case is an attractive teenage girl, the police will rip the city apart looking for information, offering huge rewards and giving the media information to keep the story in the news. It's likely that someone, somewhere, saw something: and it's equally likely that the police will find that person with enough digging, attention, and motivation.

Frequently when a case goes cold (especially a disappearance, which this would be without a body being found), the reason is that the police simply did not do proper investigative work at the outset, and the trail goes dead.

That said, i'm of the belief that the kind of mind that could kill a truly random person with no actual motive, is the kind of mind that would have a hard time staying out of trouble and not making mistakes. That's why most thrill killers *are* caught - they make lots of mistakes.",2016-10-04 03:51:57+00:00,d8d45wp,1.0,t3_55q3v4,22506.0,morbidquestions

[It Follows](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3235888/) is very good - it's got a great sense of creeping dread.

842,"Rate the kid on the following factors, 1-10:

1. How white are they? 

2. How respectable is their family (and lol, respectable means ""lives in a mcmansion in a subdivision"", not ""works two jobs"")?

3. How pretty are they? Add points for being blonde haired and blue-eyed.

4. How respectable is the victim (respectability means ""Involved in church and social activities, no associating with bad elements, no drug use - in case there was some confusion, there) 

5. How likely is it a stranger abducted them? 

6. How compelling is the circumstances of the abduction (From their room? On vacation? On way to school? These are compelling. ""Went to bad part of town to hang out with friends"" is not compelling). 

The higher the total score, the more attention the case will get. 

If a case is not getting *any* attention it usually boils down to one of a few factors: 

1. The victim is not very compelling for the media. This might mean they aren't good looking, that they aren't from a good family, or that they are themselves unsavory in some way.

2. The local law enforcement doesn't give a shit, for whatever reason. 

3. The circumstances of the disappearance are not compelling. A non-custodial parent kidnapping them, a teenager running off with their boy/girl friend, a troubled kid who's a run-away - these are just not compelling disappearances for the media to pursue. And i would note, it doesn't matter if that's what *actually* happened - if that's what people *think* happened, that's what counts.

967,"While Garfield was not our greatest president (that distinction, of course, going to William McKinley), he was a great man. Kind, well liked and. by every account a remarkable individual. 

Perhaps my favorite story about Garfield is the story of his nomination: he goes to the republican national convention to stump for his boss, Sherman. So the ticket's Sherman, Grant, and a dude named Blaine, right? Come to pass, somehow, after 36 ballots, the nominee is...James Garfield! Dude showed up at the convention not even in the running, and ended up the nominee. 

Had he had more time in office (He only had the honor of serving in the highest office for around six months, and 11 weeks of that was spent deathly ill), he would have surely done much good for this nation. Tragically that was not to be.

973,"There's a few possibilities, here:

1. The player gives up something temporarily (stat hit, can't see/hear/talk/recognize faces etc, can't use bladed weapons, what have you) 

2. The player gives up something *forever* - same as above, plus limbs, items, etc. Preferably magic cannot restore what's been lost. An interesting twist here would be if any gains were lost. So you cast a fireball to blow open a castle door, but any loot you get (or half of it), you must sacrifice to the demon who let you cast the fireball.

3. The player must commit some act. This act may be relatively harmless (""throw a single gold coin into the harbor at midnight"") or totally depraved (""Kill an entire church full of worshippers on the high holy day""). The enforcement may be extremely strict (""Sorry, you threw in that coin at 12:01, NOT midnight..."") or rather lax (""Eh, you got 20 of the 22 of them, that's good enough..""); ideally the player should have no idea which it'll be in *this* case. 

4. The more the player courts one power, the less the other powers should like them (and the more they should demand for access). This should, ideally, not be very severe in nature unless the players are blatantly preferring one power over the others. 

5. One cost might be that you get a bounty on your head. A champion will get a ""vision"" of you + the party, and begin seeking you. Every encounter, roll to see when he shows up to cause problems. This could be a holy champion or an evil one. If your players are particularly potent, he'll show up with a retinue. 

6. It might be that the magic count-down isn't on the *players*, but on the *world*. After a certain amount of demonic (or whatever) rituals are done, a great chasm opens and demons pour forth. This isn't an apocalyptic event, merely an extremely unpleasant one - like 1d10 hundred demons pour out near a major population center.

1048,"Not much of a story. She got bowel cancer. Got a colostomy to help with this, but the surgery was very hard on her. She decided to go the hospice route, rather than a futile struggle and prolonged suffering.

There were days of her being barely with us, drifting in and out. She didn't want anything at that point - food nor drink. The hospice personnel told us this was normal; at a point of illness, your body stops wanting. 

Anyway, after some time of this, she went unconscious. Her breathing was incredibly slow, my mother counted 48 seconds between breaths. She looked worse than a corpse, and i don't say that lightly. 

We made the decision to send her to the hospice facility, where they could better maintain her medication (which was morphine, and morphine alone). 

So, off she went. No food nor water for six days, as she lay unmoving, unwaking, breathing but just barely. Finally she passed. 

This is largely why i'm a supporter of euthanasia. My grandmother lived about seven days longer than she would have wanted to. But in ohio there was very little we could legally do to help her meet her end faster. She had to just die on her own. It was an extremely unpleasant experience for everyone.

1061,"The easiest explanation is that the technology is non-intuitive. it's not that it's particularly *advanced* per se, it's just not working the way people expect it to work. 

Here's an example from life: I owned a Mercedes 300 SD Turbo Diesel, from 1983. The ignition system had a pneumatic tube(!) going to the key area. Now, i have no clue what this tube did, but if it was disconnected, the car would not start. If it was connected, it did start. I never did figure out it's purpose or intent.

Now imagine that only on a grander scale. You take apart iron man's gauntlet (no small feat!) and discover that there's paper-thin sheets of plastic inside. If their removed, the armor just doesn't work. if they are in place, it works. You try and try to figure it out - you put a whole lab on it - but no one knows what they do. 

Tony Stark doesn't bother to tell anyone what those sheets do, because to him, it's 100% obvious why they are there, what their doing, and even details like the specific shape and form. It's so obvious that to him, it's not even worth discussing. And so it goes.

And of course it could be a situation like in Orion's Arm: you think it's magical technology, but really they just discovered something akin to E=MC^2 and are exploiting that new (and unique) understanding to good effect. Perhaps their power source is actually a captive universe, or maybe they found a way to make an entire block of metal one giant molecule, held together by ultra-strong nuclear forces.

Every rider has their own feelings about helmets and their impact on their riding ability and subjective experience, and the people i was around felt that it should be down to the rider to make that assessment for themselves, each and every time they get on the bike.

My favorite take on the situation was by a friend of my mothers, who commented that the best time to wear a helmet is in town, because of the risk of cars hitting your bike at low speed and knocking you to the ground. Any other time, if a helmet made a difference or not was pretty much a tossup, and often just ensured a recognizable face for an open-casket ceremony. 

Me, personally? I think a person's a damn fool to ride a bike, and that the risk inherent to the activity means that passing helmet laws are folly at best, over-reach at worst.

What's not as well known, is that after dealing with that, his major concern was how the news he'd been shot would be broken to his (very frail and emotionally delicate) wife.

I can't imagine being in that chaotic, frightening, painful situation - and still having that much fortitude of spirit, that much presence of mind to think not of myself, but of others. Even the man who'd just attacked me. I can't even imagine it. 

But you want to know the saddest thing? The reason he was shot was because he was walking in the crowd, shaking hands and talking to people.

Orient: What's my current situation? How do they view me? 

Decide: What's the best tact to take at this moment? Which part of the FORD mnemonic should i be focusing on? What word choices or tone choices should i be making right now?

Act: Carry it out

Return to top of loop, continue. This isn't something that happens every 30 seconds or whatever, it's constant within the encounter: observe, orient, decide, act. Over and over. Massage the message and delivery, refine their image of me, present myself as someone they *really want* in their life.

We don't revoke people's right to bear arms because they have a noise complaint or are facing a charge that they may well be found innocent of or plea down to a misdemeanor.

This guy sounds like he was a troubled individual, but it doesn't seem that before this he was violent. Depressed, anxious, with some drug issues - but not violent.

[Casefile Podcast](http://casefilepodcast.com/) is very good. Covers cases you don't often hear about in places like Australia, britain, Ireland, Canada.

[Breakdown](http://breakdown.myajc.com/) is good if you LOVE detail. They take the case apart at an almost atomic level, and discuss every little nuance of the case, the trial, the evidence.

[Vanished Podcast](http://www.thevanishedpodcast.com/) is very good. Covers missing people, lately they've been doing lots of interviews with people involved in the case (family, friends, etc).

[Trail Went Cold](http://trailwentcold.the-back-row.com/) is about (typically) unsolved cases, some of them quite perplexing/concerning.

The first and easiest? Lock them in a cage, ala Oz, for the duration.

It would also be wise if they looked like a freak during (like a wolf-person hybrid). Could be tricky if they are freak-strong, though, or very cunning. 

The second and not-quite-as-easy is the ""national park"" model: come that time, you go to a wildlife area and turn them loose, and they go hunt deer or whatever the hell it is werewolves do when their wolves, and then they return when their done. This works if their not violent by nature, and only turn into a ""normal"" wolf with normal wolven drives.

The other possibility...well, you join them. You stop being the binding that holds them back, and start being the rope that lifts them up.

They are used to arbitrary and poor management decisions, and are disinclined to go poking around at other employee's work, especially in other departments or areas.

Notably, Billy Gaffney's mother wasn't convinced he actually committed the crime (and his behavior when confronted by her was quite odd). The eye witnesses who identified him in the McDonnell murder might well have seen his picture in the press or otherwise been coached. Policing at the time was not as good as it could have been. 

Add to that, Fish seemed to love to shock people, and to say and do things that made him be viewed with fear, disgust, and loathing (which fits with his masochism and tendency to hurt himself). Might it be the case that he saw a chance to gain some easy notoriety and ran with it, knowing that it would get him more press calling him a monster?

Certainly the press was happy to run with his story, and ate up everything he claimed as though it were the gospel truth.

I'm in near constant pain from injuries that - when i was 18 - either didn't yet exist or barely bothered me.

And i bet that's how it is no matter how old you get: every day's just about the same as the one before, and you don't really ever *feel* older because of it. So you get to be 50, then 60, then 80 and every day you think ""well it's not so bad, really."" and just keep on going.

1554,"I must defer to peter watts, and the concept of a [life sausage](http://www.rifters.com/crawl/?p=2814) (Warning: gut-wrenching blog post by a very talented author about a sad thing). In the case of say, strychnine, the *end* of the life sausage is very low, but very short. 

There are many very painful ways to kill yourself, that are - mercifully - short. For example, death by a fire that's close, but not close enough to burn your lungs and quickly kill you - is incredibly painful, but relatively short, perhaps an hour.  Likewise, some poisons may take a few days to kill you, horrifically painful all the while. Severe radiation poisoning, likewise, is unbelievably painful and bad, stretching out to perhaps a few days to a few weeks in some cases, before the victim expires.


Instead, there may well be a way to commit suicide that *minimizes the overall area* of that life sausage, that causes misery for years and decades. And for that, i posit that chronic alcoholism is, in fact, one of the worse ways to commit suicide.

Not only do you destroy your body, but you destroy your relationships, your friendships, your family. What's worse is that sometimes there are glimmers of hope: things improve, you get on the wagon, you talk about recovery, but you just fall off again, back into misery and poverty and sickness.

It turns your life sausage into a wedge, until finally you die, diseased and addled and alone. 

Oh, and an added bonus bit of morbidity: [The Hi-Fi Murders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hi-Fi_murders#Murder.2C_torture_and_rape) featured victims being forced to drink Draino; on occasion people commit suicide by drinking Draino, and it sounds pretty rough.

1649,"I dunno; this page by [the department of agriculture](http://www.agriculture.pa.gov/Protect/RideMeasurement/amusement%20rides/Pages/default.aspx) mentions ""700 amusement operations""; that's only about 14 rides per operation on average, which seems reasonable. 

That said, there are some alarming little details about how this all works. For example, [this PDF](http://www.agriculture.pa.gov/Protect/RideMeasurement/amusement%20rides/Documents/Certified%20Inspector%20Study%20Material.pdf) lays out some of the requirements and laws in specific.

Just a taste: the ""Advisory Council"" consists of: 

A rep from the companies that make rides

2 reps from the ""state showmans association""

2 reps from the ""state amusement park association""

1 rep from the ""state county fairs association""

1(!) mechanical engineer

2 ""Public representatives"" (portrayed as ""concerned citizens"" on the above linked webpage)

So you have a board on the safety of amusement rides, and it's staffed by a 1 engineer, 2 busybodies and 6 representatives of the people who will lose money if standards are raised? holy shit. 

And then there's this little gem: the login page for the [""AMUSEMENT RIDE INSPECTION SYSTEM""](http://www.agriculture.pa.gov/Services/Pages/Amusement-Rides-Inspection-System.aspx), which features a specific login titled: ""I am a company-affiliated inspector.""

So who's doing the inspections on the rides? I bet it's a company employee at almost any theme park; why else have a special login for them if it wasn't very common? It also totally explains how the state can inspect 10,000 rides: alot of the inspectors work for the company and pull double duty. Inspectors are explicitly NOT employees of the department of agriculture... So again there's a fox in the chicken coop, advising how best to secure the chickens! 

All told the surprising thing is that there haven't been more accidents than there have been. ",2016-08-12 08:16:44+00:00,d6eawoq,3.0,t1_d6eagms,1417.0,MorbidReality

There's also this thing where she had to memorize all these bones for anatomy and physiology, and i told her that it reminded me of boot camp: You have this tedious, difficult thing to do that everyone *has* to do, and that some people fail at. That way the people who come out of it feel accomplished and part of a greater whole, that they can share their hardships with other in the same line of work. And sure enough, if you ask almost any nurse about difficult courses they'll say ""anatomy and physiology!"" and they'll all sort of murmur about how hard it was, just like soldiers and boot camp.

1795,"Holy shit, man: have i got a story for you.

So i decide to run one of the FFG games (it's specifically the one about chaos cultists, but i can't for the life of me remember the name). the setup is: The one and only player is a defector member of the imperial guard who absconded with an entire fucking destroyer , and is now docked at a space station controlled by chaos. The adventure is: she has to acquire a book, a chaos sorcerer, and possibly some more of a party at this station.

I set everything up, describe the first scene: A bar, where the patrons are playing a gambling game. How convenient, she has valuable artifacts on her and could play! 

her first thought: shoot the bar to death and take everything on the table. I tell her that won't work, it's to heavily defended by servitors. She tells me ""I have a ship and a crew, right? How many men can i field?"" Oh shit. ""Uh, it wouldn't be great to do that"" ""Alright, i'll go along for now."" she says.

She gets in on the gambling game, which is basically blackjack with a rotating dealer. She immediately wins (in like two hands) because i can tell the long, drawn out game scene i have written is worthless, here. As she leaves i give her some combat, which she handily wins.

She gets to her ship and the sorcerer from the game is waiting for her at the door. ""Can i seduce her?"" she asks, and i tell her, no, the sorcerer is a barely human follower of Tzneech and is not really amenable to the concept nor particularly attractive.

Now, this sorcerer is *necessary*. Someone has to do the rolls to figure out what the book says, someone has to do the magic required, etc. This character is very important to the storyline, and without her we're in real trouble, here. So of course: the player fucking shoots her and loots her gear.

It was an enlightening, but nightmarish, experience.

I'll assume identical handguns (because each gun has a slightly different time delay between pulling the trigger and hitting the striker, and at these speeds it matters). 

320 ft/s is way to slow to ensure fatality, you want something like a 1911 with a .45 ACP round, moving at about 900 Feet-per-second with a Hydrashock (because it makes my math easier). If this hits you in the head, you're probably gonna die. 

Let's say there's six feet from gun barrel to head. So you're not standing super close (the closer you are the harder this is gonna be!) but you're close enough that missing's unlikely.

At 6 feet, the bullet will close the distance in .006 seconds give or take a bit.

1831,"Here's a little anecdote for you. I know someone who's a casino card dealer. Here's the deal (hah!) at their casino:

1. 40 hours a week maximum, no overtime ever for any dealer.

2. Every one hour of work, they get 15 minutes of break. 

3. Schedule is fixed: You work the same hours every day, no changing of shifts around.

4. Free buffet food in the break room, and reduced cost whole meals at the employee dining room (so they eat the same food as the customers, at like 1/4th price - or free, if the buffet has anything worth eating). 

5. If there's a problem, there is a 100% clear hierarchy of who you go to with this problem, and accountability goes *up* the chain, not *down* the chain. The pit boss fucks up? It's not the dealer who's put on the block for it. 

Now why do they do this? Because money, that's why. They don't want some dealer fucking up a 1000$ bet because their exhausted, or had their shifts changed, or because they've been at the table for 6 hours straight. They know that the way to get good workers is to give them ample breaks, keep them on one schedule, etc. As a result the dealer portion of the casino runs smooth as butter most of the time, and there's never a shortage of people who are willing to do a good and competent job, despite the high stress.

The kicker is: the dealers are the *only ones* that get that treatment. All the casino's other works get the usual treatment that low-paid workers get. And those parts of the casino run about as you'd expect. ",2016-08-04 00:32:16+00:00,d639ohk,2.0,t1_d60izhr,164685.0,MorbidReality

1908,"I'm going to assume - since it makes the question more interesting - you mean slavery as it existed in the american south, in america. I'm also going to assume their used mostly for agricultural or mining work, rather than for industrial labor (because that's an entirely separate, complex issue)

The average slave price in 1860 was about $800. Now, Going by [this inflation calculator](http://www.westegg.com/inflation/), that'd be around $21,303.04 today. That feels about ""right"" - expensive enough to be a real investment, not so expensive as to be totally prohibitive to own.

Getting a better estimate is pretty hard, because there's some economy stuff here that's not to obvious. Your purchase price is only part of the consideration: You also have food, shelter, clothing, and medical for your slave. That might be 10$ a day or it might be more. So your total price is really (price + upkeep)/total working life. If an average slave has a 10 year working life, that's very different situation than an average slave with a 40 year working life. 

Plus, upkeep would be harder to figure out because there'd be a market for slave-oriented goods: slave food, slave clothes, slave bedding, slave medicine and what not. Think ""Tractor Supply"" only it'd be ""Tractor and Slave Supply"". This might reduce the cost of upkeep significantly, because there'd be some economy of scale and distribution going on. And, of course, having lots of slave labor might significantly alter the economy - the average free person might seem ""rich"" to us, because so much of their wealth is subsidized by cheap slave labor.

Of course, there are alternative types of slavery that are possible. One might be a form of ""rental slavery"", where a large company, SlaveCo, owns many thousands of slaves that they then ""rent"" on a per-time basis to end users. SlaveCo provides for food, lodging, and upkeep while the end user just pays SlaveCo to handle things. This would make a lot of sense, because it lets farmers use slaves as commodity labor instead of having to worry about a flu outbreak among the slaves or what have you. It also would prevent uprisings: SlaveCo could employ trained professionals to prevent such things, and have rapid-response forces to deal with problem spots.

If you really want to prevent decay, there's only options that can lengthen the situation, not resolve it. There are many options for embalming - the modern method is to replace the blood with a specially designed preservative fluid, for example.

For all practical purposes, the role model for life-like preservation is probably [Rosalia Lombardo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalia_Lombardo) - Trigger warning, dead kid, from 1918. Note that her preservation is a mixture of both embalming and careful technique of keeping her in a sealed vessel in a fairly dry environment.

But each unsolved mystery is it's own deal. If you got something like the Springfield Three, that's a different deal than the Fort Worth Three. If you got a wandered-off-into-forest case? That's it's own deal even from other wandered-off-into-forest cases.

Also the leather he chose isn't very good - it's way to thick and looks like something that should be a belt or a harness or a collar, not a sheath on a concealable knife.

As to the blade itself, the edges are at such an angle it looks more like a chisel than a knife, and though i'm sure it is balanced, this is closer to a throwing *spike* than a throwing *knife*.

2019,"When we talk about ""evil"" we talk about a few different concepts. 

One of those is selfishness: imagine an evil god who did evil things purely for selfish reasons. He destroys worlds, and lives, to steal artifacts, items, even individuals from them. Perhaps it craves the really rare (""The best book ever written in this entire world's history...and it's all that's left, in a language only i can read..."") or simply something that's indefinably valuable to us, like a soda cap from arizona 20 years ago that it considered fit to decimate a continent to acquire from a landfill. 

One of those is violence: It just revels in violence, either for it's own sake or for the goal of killing as many sentient beings as possible, for whatever reason, ranging from feeding on their souls to their deaths serving some greater purpose or even to resolve a philosophical dispute with another entity or to fulfill some long-ago set purpose. 

Another one might be indifference: it just does not care and incidentally kills in the process of doing other things. It's evil because it simply sees no value in life outside it's own. It doesn't care that it's passage within 1 AU irradiated the entire planet and killed everything on it, even if it would be trivial for it to prevent the problem in the first place. 

Another one might be that it's using the evil to feed itself or sustain itself; maybe just as a man needs water, it needs some sort of philosophical concept (in this case evil) to live. 

Either way it's unlikely such an entity would explain itself to mortals, or even really even be comprehensible to mortals in a traditional sense. It might not even consider mortals (even ones trying to help it) as ""real"", just as we don't recognize the individual worth of an ant on another continent.

I suppose a good candidate is Dimethylmercury. It'll blow right through latex gloves, which lead to the unfortunate case of [Karen Wetterhahn.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Wetterhahn) A few drops of the shit on her glove killed her almost a year after exposure, after an absolutely torturous and nightmarish period of suffering during which time nothing could be done for her.

Another good candidate is strychnine (my personal favorite): it can give the victim muscle contractions so hard they break bones, and is absolutely painful and agonizing until the end.

Perhaps one of the most *frightening* is a compound known as [Curare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curare), found in nature. It paralyzes you; you can feel everything, but you can't move an inch. And eventually you suffocate, as your diaphragm stops working. Perhaps most terrifying, if someone intubates you, you can be kept alive and make a full recovery - with complete memory of being trapped within your own body, unable to even move.

But perhaps that's not sufficient: i mean, to attack the body is one thing, but what about the mind? [Datura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datura) fits this bill. Datura is a plant, of course, that's toxic in a very special way: it causes a host of psychological symptoms on ingestion, including delirium, violence, complete inability to distinguish reality, and - most alarming - amnesia. Almost everyone agrees datura's a bad trip, especially at a dose beyond the minimum, which can be fatal regardless. A runner up here is [BZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-Quinuclidinyl_benzilate), a chemical warfare agent that can cause persistent hallucinations for days, among other things. 

But, perhaps most terrifying of all is the poison you can't see: Radiation. [Acute radiation syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_radiation_syndrome) is 100% pure nightmare fuel.

2184,"As with all travel, alot depends on what you're willing to accept. A quick check of expedia, giving a departure from JFK next friday and a return from Istanbul the friday after that, turns up around 1300-1600$ airfair/hotel inclusive for one person. That's flying economy and staying in decent hotels.

If you're willing to really bargain hunt for airfare you could probably cut that down somewhat, and if you're willing to couch surf or sleep in hostels (or go for less days) then you can cut it down enormously. Probably it's the case that you could also find a deal to a major city by airline then take the train into istanbul. 

Something to know about Istanbul is that it's a truly wonderful city (often considered the ""gateway"" between east and west); whatever suits your fancy, they have it. Especially it's a city of history, and of layered, intermixed culture. It's a tourist city, too, with lots for a visitor to see and do and experience.

I highly recommend checking out the many, many historical sites and museums.

[Check out the IMDB top horror movie list](http://www.imdb.com/search/title?genres=horror&amp;sort=user_rating,desc&amp;title_type=feature&amp;num_votes=25000,&amp;pf_rd_m=A2FGELUUNOQJNL&amp;pf_rd_p=2406822102&amp;pf_rd_r=1EGRAWK9MM6DK581ECV3&amp;pf_rd_s=right-6&amp;pf_rd_t=15506&amp;pf_rd_i=top&amp;ref_=chttp_gnr_12) - the top 10 are all over the place, from Silence of the Lambs (Which i wouldn't even consider horror) to two movies from the 1920's! With a field that broad, it's hard to narrow down a ""best"". 

And of course, ""best"" isn't the same as ""my favorite"" - Aliens is probably my favorite horror movie, but i wouldn't call it the best ever made. 

I dunno, i guess maybe to my thinking,  Dawn of the Dead is the best horror movie ever made. It's a movie that engages the viewer, invites them into a situation that is the ultimate in hopelessness: their trapped in a shopping mall with plenty to tide them over but no long-term viability, and surrounded by a hostile and implacable foe. Any deviation from caution, care and fear is met with death or suffering. And most importantly it invites discussion among viewers, as to how to handle the scenario and what to do in it. It's not just a movie, it's a discussion piece.

Alot of movies (like halloween or Friday the 13th or what have you) are basically just Run-Away Movies. If you can run away from the monster, you are safe. But in Dawn of the Dead, there's no where to run to. Defeating the enemy is less about your individual skill and more of a logistics issue, something you have to deal with like the weather. 

Plus i love the setting: A shopping mall seems like the perfect place to weather out something like that, but the safety it grants is illusory and temporary. Plus it's provocative, seeing a normal, everyday environment turned into something nightmarish. That makes it even easier for the viewer to get engaged and involved. 

But that's just how i see it, and i am 100% certain other people would see it differently. Maybe it's even so that everyone has a different ""best"" horror movie. ",2016-07-14 23:26:13+00:00,d5cmzpc,5.0,t1_d5bxdrw,34408.0,horror

2233,"In a lot of ways this post actually *perfectly* exemplfies the trope, too:

1. Shitting on rob zombie! Never mind his success as a film maker; he didn't exactly remake the original Halloween so it's shit, man! 

2. Mentioning a movie from *1931* as a pinnacle of the art of horror 

3. Shitting on a modern horror movie (The Conjouring) complete with humble brag about seeing the actual doll in person

4. Mention of a hitchcock film (the original, thanks, not one of those shitty remakes/popular TV series remakes!) 

But best of all: pulls out the exhausted koan about how you have to be able to identify with the monster of a movie to enjoy the film/take it seriously/etc. That's the second i knew they were fishing, because anyone who's seen the movie, read the book, or spent more than 5 minutes on wikipedia knows that the *entire point* is that pennywise is not an understandable monster. He's not frankenstein, he's not micheal myers, he's a force of evil who's sole purpose, who's only reason to exist, is to feed on the life energy of innocent children. You can't identify with pennywise because pennywise is more akin to a giant centipede or a tornado than he is, say, Norman Bates. The only thing the viewer should feel about pennywise is revulsion and disgust.

Probably the way to resolve this would be a test run with a piece of meat. Since bones don't typically burn anyway, the question boils down to how long to turn meat to ash. Hair burns on it's own. Fat burns on it's own. Muscle and sinew take a little longer. 

I would guess after 3 hours, you'd have a severely burned horse carcass. Heavy tissue damage, extremities with exposed bones, the smell of burned and charred meat hanging over the scene. Almost no skin left, but some of the deeper muscle tissues (in the chest cavity) would still be extant, in all likelihood, as well as some of the (now exposed) guts. It would be a gristly sight: parts of the flesh would look ""melted"", and recognizable parts like the head would probably still be so.

As for how long for total destruction it would depend on the size of your fire and how long it's fuel lasted if it would ever succeed. 

Here's a relevant bit of info:
&gt;A traditional Hindu funeral pyre takes six hours and burns 500–600 kilogrammes (1,102–1,323 pounds) of wood to burn a body completely.

2294,"What makes me so sure that i'm correct is that science tells us there are no magical portals or any other mystical mumbo-jumbo making people disappear. There's no proof of it, no evidence of it, and it takes tremendous leaps of the imagination to find any justification for holding the position that any disappearance of any person is more than mundane.

I appreciate that paulides spends so much time and energy drawing attention to cases; and i certainly feel his heart is in the right place and that he's acting out of good faith. However, that doesn't change the reality that any disappearance he covers has a mundane explanation, even if we don't know what it is.

As to the case this post is about: I would almost bet money that this guy'll be found in a crevice somewhere, if he's ever found at all. It takes one mistake to find yourself in a situation you can't get out of, and searchers are not infallible, and do not cover 100% of the area to 100% completion.

It doesn't require portals or bigfoot or demons or a fairy godmother or some mystical importance to national parks to have people disappear, especially in isolated areas. 

As to how long we should keep looking - i guess it depends on the circumstances of the case. In an abduction or a run-away, then we should probably keep looking forever, at some tempo.

1. would be weirder if he disappeared while NOT separated. When a person's separate from the group, bad things can happen. This is why it's advised to always stay with the group.

2. High heat can lead to heat stroke, confusion, disorientation. 

3. Doesn't mean much because....

4. he could very well be in a crevice between boulders, perhaps going in there initially to escape the heat or due to confusion.

5. The smarter someone is, the easier it is for them to be convinced that their intuition about the situation is correct and that they are doing the ""right"" thing. 

6. it would be stranger if someone disappeared in an area where no one had ever disappeared before, yes? Some environments are just inherently more dangerous than others. 

I'm not sure a news report about this guy being missing would do much good, because he's missing in an area that the average person wouldn't (and shouldn't) go searching for him, and it's unlikely that he would be encountered by chance by people on the trail.

My grandfather barely had an 8th grade education, and could read at a level such that he could mostly sort out the meaning of a news paper article. But he read the news paper religiously and certainly commented a great deal on the political cartoons.

back in the '40's, MANY people only got their news from newspapers, and the cartoons in them were certainly something that people from all classes and walks of life would see and understand.

The fetus's existence in an artificial womb does not result in anyone else's autonomy being infringed or hindered; it exists totally on it's own. There might be cases where such fetuses need to be destroyed for one reason or another, but i would find it morally objectionable if it was common practice that fetuses in artificial wombs were destroyed for trivial reasons.

2578,"the short answer is: no fall from any height *guarantees* death, but any fall from a height where you achieve terminal velocity (which is when you fall as fast as you can fall) is the best odds.

Generally speaking, a person hits terminal velocity after about a 450 meter fall: after that, it doesn't matter if the building's taller.

More important, probably, is the surface struck when a person falls: a solid surface like concrete, struck head first, will be more likely to kill someone than a softer or more giving surface struck feet first.

Here's a description of some injuries suffered by a man who leapt from the 13th story of a hotel room, onto pavement below:

&gt;Dr. Levisky's calculations revealed three separate fracture sites: one was in the upper body, particularly the ribs and shoulders where Olson must have collided with a construction barrier at street level; another in the lower legs as they impacted the sidewalk with the forces of velocity having traveled upward to cause a “book” fracture in the pelvis (opening it like the pages of a book); and dissipating the upward thrust so as to protect the vertebral column from any dislodgement; and thirdly, a horizontally aligned fracture to the right temporal and parietal bones of Dr. Olson's skull, occasioned in all probability when his head hit the sidewalk after his feet had first struck the pavement and he just toppled over. At the point of impact, the skull was split from right to left across the top of the skull allowing it to be manipulated as if it were hinged.

Perhaps most horrifying, he lived for a short time after the fall, before expiring! Humans can be very tough, sometimes.",2016-06-26 20:02:48+00:00,d4oy79i,1.0,t3_4pw0hy,58664.0,morbidquestions

It turns out that if you want a mass casualty event of any kind, a great place to do it is at a night club.

And: Almost everyone there is drunk, and so even easier targets than you'd expect.

The best defense against being shot at is to get away from the shooter. You get out the building and down the street and you're probably OK. It's hard to do that in a night club packed wall to wall with people, all of them trying to run away. 

What could be done for this situation, i do not know. I guess you could mandate legal changes to the way night clubs are designed, but how that'd be rolled out, enforced, and followed up on are something i could not even fathom.

The acidity is actually very simple to explain: most anything can detect light and dark, and the creatures simply wait until dark to release the acid, and then (either through their own effort or through some other means) the acid's neutralized when the sun rises. 

If anything this sort of lifestyle would be pretty easy to explain: since each part of the organism only does it's own job, it could grow to enormous sizes, drifting around at sea. Trees and other animals would naturally grow or subsist on such a substrate, and it's large enough that predation's a non-issue.

3370,"hmm. A few things: 

When asked about the war, he mentioned his biggest fear was Kamikazes (because he'd been near one hit the ship) but the biggest annoyance was petty theft, particularly of his lunch, which he spent more time talking about than actual combat in the interview we did for school. 

Some of the papers he left behind include actual ships memo's (including some about Leyte) and i recall them mentioning for sailors not to fight among themselves when the ships met up. they also had a ship-board newspaper, and my town had sent out a sort of ""news letter"" that collated news from all the dispersed service people.  

He was in japan for a short time after the surrender, and i asked him about the food he ate, and he said ""Oh, hot dogs, mostly, or hamburgers?""; he'd refused to even try any of the japanese food. When i got my first job i took him to a chinese restaurant, and after asking me if the oysters were ""bugs"", he sat down his plate and walked out. Some things never change, i guess.

But the thing that has always touched me most is this: he didn't want to go to war, and did not volunteer. He was drafted into the navy, having grown up in very rural ohio his whole life. But even though he didn't want to serve, he did his duty with honor and he had pride all his days for his service, but never talked about it very much unless directly asked. 

OH! And when i was a kid and had Silent Service for the NES, he recognized the ship outlines, all those years later. I specifically recall him seeing a japanese troop ship, and saying ""that's a troop ship!"" and being totally amazed they'd ever make a game about world war 2, let alone the navy.

&gt; 2. Because when Women cease to be handsome, they study to be good. To maintain their Influence over Men, they supply the Diminution of Beauty by an Augmentation of Utility. They learn to do a 1000 Services small and great, and are the most tender and useful of all Friends when you are sick. Thus they continue amiable. And hence there is hardly such a thing to be found as an old Woman who is not a good Woman.
&gt; 
&gt; 3. Because there is no hazard of Children, which irregularly produc'd may be attended with much Inconvenience.
&gt; 
&gt; 4. Because thro' more Experience, they are more prudent and discreet in conducting an Intrigue to prevent Suspicion. The Commerce with them is therefore safer with regard to your Reputation. And with regard to theirs, if the Affair should happen to be known, considerate People might be rather inclin'd to excuse an old Woman who would kindly take care of a young Man, form his Manners by her good Counsels, and prevent his ruining his Health and Fortune among mercenary Prostitutes.
&gt; 
&gt; 5. Because in every Animal that walks upright, the Deficiency of the Fluids that fill the Muscles appears first in the highest Part: The Face first grows lank and wrinkled; then the Neck; then the Breast and Arms; the lower Parts continuing to the last as plump as ever: So that covering all above with a Basket, and regarding2 only what is below the Girdle, it is impossible of two Women to know an old from a young one. And as in the dark all Cats are grey, the Pleasure of corporal Enjoyment with an old Woman is at least equal, and frequently superior, every Knack being by Practice capable of Improvement.
&gt; 
&gt; 6. Because the Sin is less. The debauching a Virgin may be her Ruin, and make her for Life unhappy.
&gt; 
&gt; 7. Because the Compunction is less. The having made a young Girl miserable may give you frequent bitter Reflections; none of which can attend the making an old Woman happy.

3677,"I'm of two minds, because of my background. 

On the MMO I played years ago (DDO!) certain quests and raids were pretty much required to have a viable character build. These quests were also sometimes very difficult in a literal ""do the thing in the right way at the right time"" sense. 

Now, the party's 6 people (12 for raids). You could have some amount of deadweight and be alright, but if you had idiots you were in real trouble. So now a raid that's taking 20 minutes is botched and everyone has to start over, and some people have to leave cause it's late or they've got dinner or whatever so you have to spend more time getting people to fill the party, etc.

me and a guildmate used to do speed leveling, and when you're doing speed leveling you have to know *exactly* what to do, *exactly* when to do it, *exactly* how to do it.  If we took along someone who had no clue, it could turn a 30 second run into a 2 minute run (or more), and turn ""get a level a night"" into ""get a level every two days"" and throw everything out of whack with the people we were leveling to catch up to or whatnot. 

And that's not even looking at the people who are only on every few days or who only play for an hour a night so it's impossible to coordinate with them or ever make any plans or ever get their gear to a good point...

So in that sense, i'm not a real fan of ""casual gaming"" on games where i've invested a lot of time and energy and am working towards some goal. If someone wants to fuck around and just have fun, that's cool, but i'd appreciate it if they didn't drag my groups down or whatnot.

It's the same way with strategy games or minecraft: if someone wants to show up and goof off, that's wasting my time and thwarting my fun. If they want to have an experience where they just do whatever, that's cool: just not around me. 

But being ignorant to people isn't OK, and creating a toxic atmosphere where new people of *any* intent feel off put is self destructive to the game and to the community. ",2016-05-09 12:35:00+00:00,d2yi7va,3.0,t1_d2xyl3i,47889.0,SubredditDrama

3679,"Starting a cult is actually pretty easy, and can happen by accident! That said the big pre-requisite is charisma, which not a lot of people have. 

The key element of cults is isolation. Once you get people isolated from outside influences, they can't help but buy into your bullshit to some extent. Isolating people is just a matter of drawing a line between ""us"" and ""them"", and scolding people for any contact with ""them"" that's not within cult doctrine. For example, say you're a christian cult. You might have a part of every prayer meeting where you call people up and ask them if they've touched any sinners lately. Then you berate them for this in front of the group: why are they allowing themselves to be tainted? Why are they willing to touch someone who's rejected god? That'll be 2 hours of praying on rice, brother John, so you can show your dedication! 

There's always rubes who look for easy answers: they want to be special, they want to be part of something bigger than themselves, they want to have something that sets them apart from other people. A religious group with a charismatic leader can certainly provide the feeling of those things, and any challenges issued (like doing labor, collecting donations, etc etc) are just justifications to the believer's mind. Every sacrifice made puts them closer to the group. Lots of cults also engage in stuff like renaming people, and declaring all members family or whatnot. 

As an aside, you are spot on about how easy it is to be a cult in america: it's very easy to found a non-profit church and be ready to literally rake in money, totally legally. It's not even illegal to run a cult, so long as you aren't doing blatantly illegal things like murdering people or prostitution or something.

If it's not known that dogs can talk (ie you're the only thing like you there is) then you could have lots of value as a scout/spy. Can you also communicate with dogs? If so you're a more valuable scout. There's places a dog can't go (like inside stores and office buildings, typically) but there's lots of places they can slink into and not be noticed, if their not threatening. For lots of people stray dogs just blend into the background. 

If your'e a beefy dog you'd probably be decent at combat - think police dog. But that would put you at risk because big dogs get noticed and have the authorities called on them.

There's many places a dog could go that a person couldn't due to size constraints.

3768,"I don't know about uncontracted tribes, but i do know this, from the [Havamal](http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/havamal.html#wanderers), which is from the time of the vikings:

Advice For Wanderers, verse 71: 


    The lame can ride horse, the handless drive cattle, 
    the deaf one can fight and prevail,
    'tis happier for the blind than for him on the bale-fire,
    but no man hath care for a corpse.

Which i have always taken to mean: It's better to be alive than dead, and even if you have a serious disability, you can still have a meaningful life and shouldn't be discarded or ignored because of your injury or illness. There's even notes that seem very modern there, with people getting tasks based on ability. 

At the time, living was incredibly hard for many people. Crop production was low, almost everyone was poor and there was almost always not enough food, not enough cloth, not enough of anything. They lived in what we today would call incredible deprivation and poverty. No one could blame them if they took a lifeboat mentality and were like ""if you're a cripple, you're an exile"". But they did not. Instead, in a poem they attribute to the mightiest and wisest of gods, they talk about the virtue of disabled people and their value.

If even the vikings could see the value in disabled people, then i think we all should.

As an aside, i also consider it very unpatriotic to not support disabled citizens. We're all americans, and if we can benefit from the innovations, hard work, and intelligence of the able-bodied and sound of mind, we should likewise support the disabled of mind and body.

3872,"table top games work in a million different ways, but here's one example: 

I design a setting, let's say it's a roman setting. And i have some players who want to be, oh, a roman senator and a centurion and another centurion. Maybe the centurions are guards to the senator, so they have a reason to hang out.

So i tell them something like ""You wake up today, and it's a beautiful day in rome. You slept well last night, with a bottle of good wine and a few tales told around the table. Senator, today is the day you have to give your speech at the forum. Your guards better be on their toes - the Dagger of the North is still rumored to have been hired to kill you. What do you all want to do first?"" 

And maybe the senator says ""I get ready for the day, go over my notes on the speech."" and maybe the centurions day ""we get on our armor and weapons, and go to meet the senator in his office."" 

Skipping ahead a bit, maybe the senator and his guards get to the forum, and sure enough, as they walk in, someone with a gladius attacks! The senator says ""I take cover behind my guards!"" and the two guards prepare for combat, drawing their own swords and blocking the path to the senator. 

Then they fight: and i roll dice for each person to see how they do. The two centurions fight, and since their skilled warriors with proper equipment, their probably going to do really well. The senator meanwhile just tries to stay out of the way, even when two more attackers appear behind them, and he has to (literally) run. Maybe i make him make rolls to run away, or maybe i just let him disengage as he wishes. 

And so then after the fight's over, the players ask me about what's on the assassin's bodies (one has a parchment with a dagger and a tree, the symbol of the Dagger of the North, in his tunic) and then they talk to people in the area and slowly work out where the Dagger might be hiding in rome, and go after him, or try to convince the guards to go after him, or try to meet him to call off his killers with diplomacy, intimidation, or bribery. 

And even then there's the question of who is pulling the Dagger's strings and why he even cares about the senator this much, and that's a whole other thing to figure out (perhaps via the senator's no doubt massive diplomacy skill).

but that's just what one table-top game is like, they can be very different or feature anything you want. I've even seen tabletop games for things like roleplaying a sleep over, or being a teenager in highschool who's also a ghost, or for being a demon in hell or an astronaut or for leading an army or whatever else, all different.  

Some are very rules heavy and define every little thing, some are very rules light and are almost totally narrative experiences, some have maps and little statues and some don't. 

[the D20 SRD](http://www.d20srd.org/) will give you some idea what one tabletop game is like, but like i say they are all very different. ",2016-05-01 10:10:13+00:00,d2oa78r,3.0,t1_d2nzizd,29590.0,worldbuilding

3879,"It'd be a little tricky because of carbon. [Carbon sublimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon), it does not melt under normal conditions. It sublimes at around 9,980 °F at atmospheric pressure.

So you'd need a fire hotter than that. [The hottest ""fire"" we have](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flame#Hottest_flame_temperature) is some shit called Dicyanoacetylene, which burns at 10340 degrees F in the presence of ozone. Thermite, by comparison, tops out at a little over 4000 F. 

But there's an amusing catch, here. 

For something the size of a body, how would you build a vessel that could contain it that would burn it without, itself, being burned? I suspect you'd end up with a sort of ""lava"" that the body was in, along with parts of the crematorium and whatever contained the body; but with enough time and enough heat, it should all boil away leaving no trace at all. 

if you have access to a functional form of nuclear fusion - a bomb, say - that would at close range atomize the body. In fact, it might be possible to design an explosive device such that it atomized the body, but it would be a challenging thing from an engineering perspective, because the blast would tend to scatter rather than shatter, if that makes sense.

Another possibility is to treat mages as *artillery* rather than as front-line combatants. So your pikemen are rolling up and the mages are casting spells from behind cover/beyond the battlefield, and the riflemen just have to deal with it.

Could also say that the mages are mostly used to summon combatants (i would have fun with this and flavor the hell out of it - some do demons, some do skeletons, some do mythical creatures, etc).

Just because you're not quite sophisticated enough to understand how documentaries like this actually work, i'll break it down:

1. They present the working conditions as harsh, rugged things that only a fool or the desperate would endure! Look at the brave Sherpa, helping the courageous ~~rich white guy~~ bold mountain climber summit the lethal mountain! 

2. Look at how poor the sherpa are! By giving them this work, you're helping them and their families have a good life on the unforgiving mountain! 

3. We should all be grateful to the sherpa for the noble duty they provide to the ~~rich white guy~~ bold mountain climbers! Book your tour to bold, wonderful Nepal Today!

4130,"Looking through the AD&amp;D supplement ""Council of Wyrms"" that concerns player character dragon characters, i could find nothing mentioning:

1. Disease immunity

2. Lycanthropy

What i DID find is that non-mature (pre-7th level) dragon characters need to make a ""system shock"" roll to shape shift to and from human form, and can - i shit you not - be trapped in human form with no memory of being a dragon for some number of years(!). 

So, i don't see any reason a dragon - in humanoid or other form - couldn't get a disease of some type. 

But that begs the question: what is lycanthropy? The AD&amp;D monster manual has a whole section on it, and it includes these tidbits:

1. There's a curse effect (""Curse of Lycanthropy"") - 6th level wizard spell, probably a dragon could beat this pretty easily.

2. There's an infection mechanic based off damage taken by a ""true lycanthrope"" (ie, one born that way). With this, the *only cure* is to eat a sprig of belladonna, or to cast remove curse at specific times (day before, day of, day after the full moon). The dragon could *likely* do this himself, but it's hard to say.

But here's the pisser: You'd think, ""well, the dragon can just polymorph out of being a werewolf, anyway"" except that the AD&amp;D monster manual specifically says that the afflicted character is *no longer under player control, but DM control*, and is overcome with ""blood lust"". So they'd be to busy pillaging to worry to much about trifles like not being a werewolf anymore, when they actually changed.

What my take away from this would be is that, indeed, you could have a dragon who was also a werewolf, subject to the curse of the moon and transitioning to a werewolf-like form once a month, BUT that the dragon could probably fix the problem fairly easily, and it not be a serious issue except in rare edge cases. 

If i am incorrect in any of this please inform me, because i looked through my books in a hurry and might have missed something.",2016-04-18 18:11:57+00:00,d27st86,1.0,t3_4fbal2,26144.0,monsterdeconstruction

4189,"My favorite part about shop class was that the instructor - an awesome dude - ran it *exactly like a real shop*. You had assignments to do, but he didn't give a shit who did what or when, so long as progress was being made in some fashion. There was also a system of ""checking out"" on a machine, where he'd teach you to run it, and then have you show someone else how to run it, the next day, to show you had proficiency. We also had to keep the shop clean ourselves, and took turns on the cleaning duty. 

He also had a very blunt attitude about safety, from which stand out two anecdotes:

firstly, he told us that he did not mind taking kids to the ER to get fingers sewn back on, but that ""you can't sew dust, so don't mess with the grinder until you're checked out on it"" and he related a charming story where a young man did, in fact, grind two fingers off accidentally. 

Secondly, instead of telling us the dangers of the table saw ""kicking"" wood out, he demo'd it, having a 2-by-4 go through a piece of plywood while we stood there shit-scared. ""Kick outs happen, so don't stand where the plywood was."" Sure enough, not even three months into the semester, a board kicked out and went sailing into the wall, but no one got hurt. 

When i started working in a factory after school, the experience was very familiar because of that class: the attitude of the boss, the attitude towards safety (""Hey dipshit, see the metal shavings? they'll burrow into your eye, don't stand there""), even the way the factory itself was in terms of cleanliness and order.",2016-04-15 17:19:43+00:00,d247vmk,2.0,t1_d24754r,970.0,FloridaMan

A notable recent incident was that a dude was visiting the neighbors down the street, and my three dogs ran over there snapping and snarling jumping at his car. I went over as he tried to push the dogs away saying ""no stop, don't do that"" and here he had a dog in his car (a service dog, he has PTSD, i later learned). As i got there and began to shoo my dogs away he said ""My girlfriend will be pissed if the car's scratched"" and i said ""I'm sure it's fine."" as i yelled for my girlfriend to come get the other two dogs since i could only handle the one. 

The guy who does lawn care for the church down the street complained about how he was ""going home stinking"" from running over the dog shit with his mower, and we told him it was strays shitting there, which he obviously didn't believe but didn't say anything just went back to mowing.

4634,"Not a janitor, but this has always stuck with me.

At my old high school, the shop class (where all the fuckups went) was right next to the bathrooms. So any time the bathrooms got fucked up, we got blamed for it, because that's just easier than finding out who really did it.

So one day we're in class, and the principal and the janitor (looking *fucking insane*) comes in, talks to the teacher, who calls a class meeting. 

""Did any of you shit on the floor of the men's room?"" he asks.

We all say no. Principal corrects him: it was not one person, it was like six people's worth of shit.

Janitor - who i had never heard speak in my life up to this day - says ""I am not cleaning that up. I'm not."" 

The princpal (who was a real bastard) is like ""If whoever did this disgusting thing admits it, there will be no punishment, you just have to clean it up."" 

So then i realize: the janitor is not fucking around. he is literally refusing to clean the shit up and they need some scape goat to clean it up. 

No one owned up, so the principal threatened dire sanctions, then went out and spent a solid 5 minutes talking to the still insane-looking janitor until the janitor went back into the bathroom and, i assume, cleaned up the shitpile.

Of course people poach elephants because they want money; it's the only reason someone would go to the time and trouble to kill the elephants and harvest the tusks.

In light of that, it'd be better to look at ways to reduce the value poachers get from poaching: perhaps by long jail sentences, or by better arming park rangers, or by removing end purchasers. 

Either way, saying ""their poor, that's why they do it!"" isn't very enlightening; lots of poor people (even in areas with elephants) don't go around poaching elephants, so clearly there are additional factors at work other than just poverty.

As to the weakness: they may not realize they have it. If we ran into a race that drank liquid cyanide, we might be very surprised the first time one of them spilled a drink on us.

High technology does not negate the value of doors or cupboards; perhaps they simply don't have the concept in their culture of a sealed room, and find the concept utterly perplexing or disturbing, the way we might find a race that had no closures of any kind on their buildings.

Crop circles could just be their way of communicating, like how we use radio waves. perhaps the crop circles are just a side effect, and the actual ""communication"" is something else, that's not detectable to humans.

4866,"I have pretty extensive experience with black powder firearms, and here's my own conclusion: 

cap and ball weapons are a pain in the ass to load, but work a full 95% of the time provided you don't make some grave fuckup like not putting the cap on or the cap falling off or something. I wouldn't want to run around with one in a holster, but i could see it.

flintlock weapons are so temperamental that unless you are always on the ball, you can expect a misfire rate of like 25-50%. Drawing one rapidly and firing it would fall under *not* being ""on the ball"", and very likely result in misfire. OTOH, it's fairly quick to prepare for a refire (just put more powder in the pan). 

Either one when fired is dangerous as fuck; the one i have the most experience with (an Uberti 1851 remake) generated about 250 foot pounds ([According to this website](http://poconoshooting.com/blackpowderballistics.html)). For comparison, federal 9mm is about 350 foot pounds (but a much lighter projectile). 

People were certainly shot and killed with flintlocks and other black powder weapons historically (and later than you might think).

The main evidence against him is that chambers knew him, they went to the same school (but years apart), and lived in the same neighborhood. As well, his house was within walking distance of the last place she was seen alive. That's all circumstantial stuff, nothing conclusive.

I suspect it's possible that when the cops in the chamber's case heard about this likely suspect, they jumped on it, because:

A) He's an unloveable loser who looks legitimately good for the crime

B) It'd get the media pressure off the police

C) It would be years before he was back in their state for trial, anyway - and everyone would have more or less forgotten by then.

It's certainly possible trellis is involved, but until better evidence comes up, this is starting to look a lot like the holly bobo case.",2016-03-02 01:10:34+00:00,d0k45r0,3.0,t1_d0jzzww,6234.0,serialkillers

5095,"How did this (though not in a roguelike) was as follows:

Lets say the player is very fond of using a sword, and doing slashing attacks from melee range. The next turn, the AI would have some defense against slashing (not enough to be invulnerable, just enough to reduce the value of the players tactic). I also reduce resistance to other attack types at the same time (to increase the value of the new tactics). 

So the next turn, he keeps using that sword: he just powers through the resistances. So i increase resistances again (and maybe increase melee damage output, too). 

Eventually the player either plateaus and can't get any further with the strat he's using, or he changes strategies and takes advantage of the new weaknesses to piercing and ranged damage. 

In this way there wasn't any need for a complex state machine, but there were benefits to diversifying strategy and not becoming complacent. ",2016-03-01 10:47:23+00:00,d0j7s02,1.0,t3_48f173,14080.0,roguelikedev

I don't see anyone telling them they can't marry and have kids if they want to. You want to argue that we should go ""educate"" people because of epidemiology, we should probably start with the larger problem rather than this tiny, isolated group. 

Not to mention, their status of being in illegal marriages (and constantly harassed by the authorities) makes it all but impossible for them to find anyone to join them from outside the community.

[This article](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/why-the-wild-things-are/201302/do-mass-killers-start-out-harming-pets) lists a few who started off killing animals:

&gt;On Oct. 1, 1997, Luke Woodham, a sophomore at Pearl High School, in a suburb of Jackson, MI, stabbed his mother to death and then opened fire on classmates with a hunting rifle, killing two girls and wounding seven other students.  Investigators later found Woodham’s account of his torture and killing of his pet dog Sparkle, which the boy described as his “first kill.”  On May 21, 1998, fifteen year old Kip Kinkel shot his parents to death before emptying three guns at his classmates in Thurston High School, Springfield, OR, leaving one dead and 26 injured.  Kip had often bragged to others at school about how he tortured animals.  Jeffrey Dahmer, Albert DeSalvo (the “Boston strangler”), David Berkowitz (the “Son of Sam”) and Carroll Edward Cole, a serial killer accused of 35 deaths, all recounted animal torture as their first violent act.  When counselors at several federal penitentiaries evaluated inmates for levels of aggression, 70% of the most violent prisoners had serious and repeated animal abuse in their childhood histories, as compared to 6% of nonaggressive prisoners in the same facilities.

I was 100% convinced there's one of a serial killer who accidentally killed a victim by duct-taping them but i couldn't find it in the short time i spent searching. 

A lot of the time it seems to be an incidental thing: they wrap the head in duct-tape for whatever reason and unintentionally cover the nose and mouth leading to suffocation. 

Perhaps interestingly, there's also a lot of weird fetish stuff that a google turned up for ""duct-tape suffocation"".

2. it ain't like anyone 200 years in the past gave a *shit* about us. They didn't lay any gold-brick road thinking of the people of the distant future; they didn't suffer in their present for the good of those who would come later. In fact if anything, they gave less of a damn than we do.

Could we reasonably blame hitler for the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima? What about the russians executed by soviet leadership for cowardice in combat? 

Then there's also the problem that deaths are not created equally: a soldier dying in combat is less ""evil"" than a civilian tortured to death. It's also much easier to kill large numbers of people with industrialized warfare; when you can drop 2000 pounder bombs and level entire city blocks, that's a different ball game than sending  few guys with swords to attack a village. 

That's not even looking at the population considerations: during Muhammed's lifetime (around 600 CE) the world population was 200 million. During hitler's (around 1940) it was around 2.3 billion.

5819,"Depends how super-heated they are. High temperatures will cause metals to become more pliable. That said, iron melts at around 2000 degrees, and the hotter it gets the softer it gets to that point. 

Interestingly, this presents a bit of a conundrum: considering their powers and natural defenses, they might never develop a ""fighting style"" much beyond just sprinting at the enemy, casting aside projectiles with their gravity manipulation and then engaging in hand-to-hand, knowing that even a single blow might well kill their opponent due to the heat.

I'd expect a disorganized wave attack, with the demons just charging forward as a group (probably screaming and howling) and then ramming into the humans and laying waste with claw and tail (if their tails are strong enough). 

As to weaponry, there's a few options, though none are particularly appealing. You could use Tungsten as their main weapon material, with them focusing on blunt, impact oriented weapons. Tungsten's going to ignore almost any amount of heat, and be enormously dense and heavy. Presumably they'd heat it up before combat.

Another, more exotic possibility is high-temp ceramics, which could be used for both armor and weaponry (and would make sense - the demons could use it as bullet-proof armor to deal with far-ranging human attacks). 

A key question to ask is ""does this weapon actually enhance it's combat ability over it's natural ability and inclination?"" ",2016-01-23 09:36:33+00:00,cz8sz8b,1.0,t3_428mxq,30346.0,worldbuilding

But i guess my favorite thing about him is what a decent human being he was. He loved his wife, and he loved the american people.  He was shot because he had absolute faith that no one would hurt him and that the people loved him. 

Did you know, when he was shot, the crowd began to beat his assassin to death; he called them off. Told them not to kill the guy. I mean think of it, you've just been shot, you're laying there in agony, and you have the presence of mind to save the life of the man what shot you.

I knew a guy in highschool who was a raging homophobe, who felt - indeed - that gay men would in some way force themselves upon him.

I don't remember his exact phrasing, but it was like ""oh man don't you ever have the urge to just run up to so and so and grab onto her, when she wears that pink sweater?"" 

and when i expressed that - indeed, no, i did not wish to molest my classmates, he acted like i was just unwilling to *admit* i felt that way. His opinion was that all guys felt like he felt, and some just hid it for whatever reason.

I always wonder if that's the root of the ""gays will rape me"" fear: because they go around all day thinking about raping people, and just transfer that onto every guy, including gays. ",2016-01-14 19:41:53+00:00,cyy9suk,4.0,t1_cyy842k,2289.0,SubredditDrama

The big guy didn't MEAN to fuck the kid up, he was just turning around real fast and didn't realize he was there.

Arguably the greatest hero in the story is actually Hans. Here's a guy who realized:

a) Arendell could really use some adult leadership that was not a shut-in psychopath or her psychotic sister

b) Even when he realized elsa was a god-powerful witch of some kind, he *still charged after her*. Imagine, for a moment, having the balls to pull a sword on chick who can freeze a country in an instant; he never hesitated to do so, even at risk to his own life. He was brave.

c) When he had elsa captured, instead of just putting her to the sword, he was going to have a trial and execution by the law of the land, instead. He could have easily killed her in the dungeon: but he wasn't that kind of dude. 

d) Hans is the one who reveals to Anna that ""true love"" isn't him, it's her sister. That's a pretty profound (if unintentional) gift.

e) though neither princess comes to much physical harm, Anna punches him hard enough to knock him into the cold water of the harbor, and Elsa sends a snow monster after him. 

Pretty much the only dude acting like a sane, upstanding person in the entire movie is Hans, who came from a family where he had no hope of ever getting a kingdom of his own and who was (essentially) on his own in a far-off foreign land surrounded by witches and lunatics.

2. Learn to fish. It's relaxing, a good conversational starter, and the equipment and such always makes for good discussion items. Also, it's a great group activity: you can all do it ""alone together"" and if someone has to leave it's no big deal.

3. Blend. Wherever you go, blend in with the people there. It's better to get along than to stand out, most of the time. Also, it's totally acceptable to feign interest in things you don't care about if it furthers someone's opinion of you.

6086,"Well, one advantage of working with an earth-like setting is that it'd be very easy to work in cultural notes and such, and of course you have a very good map to go from for setting up political entities and such. 

Actual political systems would be tricky to work in, because they'd be so different than our existing political systems. Perhaps something like the romans had would be workable: the ""futa"" are ""citizens"" while everyone else is a non-citizen with a ""credit rating"" or a ""social status"", perhaps delineated by a specific clothing item? That way you'd have some diversity of role and status, and some chance for drama as people from different statuses interacted. 

My main advice as to free states would be this: establish any ""free states"" in areas that are either difficult to reach (like the Darien Gap or in the mountains of asia/russia) or in areas that have high-value resources that could easily be endangered (like the middle east). A few odd-balls could have left-over nuclear weapons that ensure they couldn't be invaded except at great cost. These would provide many opportunities for drama/stories - flights to them, choices to leave them, etc etc. 

An ""inquisition"" or ""church militant"" organization within the church would be an interesting twist. Are societies theocracies, or are they secular governments that merely exist along side the church, and if that's the case is there any conflict? 

I dunno. It's an interesting world. The sexual elements aside it's basically a world where some people are born superior to other people, and subjugate people because of that. It's a pretty good dystopian setting (or, from the Futa perspective, a utopian setting). ",2016-01-07 12:00:51+00:00,cyp8byn,1.0,t3_3zr308,63249.0,worldbuilding

6094,"We'd talked about it before things got real bad. She had bowel cancer (her mother had died of the same) and her opinion was that once she couldn't properly talk anymore, she didn't want to be alive and suffering and trapped. She was very afraid of not being able to communicate, of being helpless. To my knowledge, she'd never been helpless in her entire life; she was an incredibly driven, willful person. 

For a while stuff was alright. She got a colostomy, and she was on liquid morphine, and for a few hours a day she was more or less able to talk and communicate and such, but was very very weak; couldn't even lift her self up in bed, or raise her arm very much. 

Then, she went to this phase where she just would wake up, moan until she got the morphine, and then go back to sleep. It became a kind of ritual - someone would sit with her, twenty-four hours a day, waiting to give her the morphine. That went on about, oh, 5 days? Sitting with her was very eerie because her breathing was very slow. 

The last time i saw any sort of movement from her was the day they took her to hospice. She'd not stirred in over a day, and we convinced ourselves she was as good as dead; gone into a coma or something.

6416,"There's a few possibilities; i don't think there's any technologically advanced (well, much more advanced than we are) life in the galaxy. I think whatever happens, happens before a race could plausibly go to another star system. 

As to scenarios: 

A big one is that there could be considerable strife between the colony and earth, leading to conflict and war. Any ship that can get to mars is a de facto weapon if it was launched at the earth with malicious intent (to say nothing of using their ships to destabilize asteroids or something and send them spiraling towards earth). If we have any kind of asteroid mining, this would apply just as well there, too. 

There could be new diseases discovered or created. Notably the ships out would be full of people, exposed to radiation, and isolated from outside medical attention. For all we know, there could be latent diseases on mars that affect humans - or even a [shadow ecosystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_biosphere) that would cause s problems that we can't even predict until they started happening. 

There could be any *number* of social issues that come up and become severely disruptive to both groups. Imagine a ""crusade"" armed with nuclear weapons and the best technology humankind can create, attacking from orbit. 

There could be other things that no one's thought of, or that won't become apparent until it happens and by then it's to late. 

But in the end i don't think it matters what we do; our ultimate fate's inescapable, regardless of our actions or inaction. ",2015-12-14 16:01:57+00:00,cxyqwfa,8.0,t1_cxyq94e,1102.0,technology

It doesn't matter if the FBI stops a thousand supposed terrorist attacks (most of the attacks it ""stops"" are actually sting operations that net would-be terrorists, rather than actual legitimate plans that would have come to fruition); the terrorists only need to succeed 1 time out of 1000 to be effective. 

Case in point: the boston bombers weren't stopped despite enormous security efforts. Two civil servants in california with off-the-shelf assault rifles have the *entire country* worked up. For that matter, that nutbar that shot up the planned parenthood clinic certainly wouldn't have been caught by any reasonable preventative measure.

For that matter, as proof that prevention is simply *never going to stop terrorism*, look at israel: they have much less land to worry about, a much smaller population, and a clearly delinated enemy, and they *still* suffer attacks.

His main evidence against courtney love? she acted fucking weird and dressed like a slut. 

His main evidence against dylan? Well, either dylan's the single greatest source of evidence ever (when he's saying what Tom Grant wants) or he's in on the conspiracy (when he doesn't do a inch-by-inch search of the house, does drugs, or doesn't engage in Tom's role play as a police officer)

His main evidence against the seattle PD? They didn't bend over backwards to kiss some random PI's ass the day the body was found (asking him to call a few hours later), and didn't spend weeks wasting tax payer money investigating another junkie suicide.

It's pretty clear the guy wanted to be treated like a cop (the entire ""interview with dylan"" scene near the end of the film standing out in particular, his desire to catch people out even though their his client, etc), and when he wasn't he just lost his shit and let this thing turn into a gigantic obsession. 

The only evidence he has is a (possibly spurious) heroin blood level test (which is it: are the cops not doing their job and forensics, or are the forensics they did iron clad?), a suicide note that a lawyer has an ""inutition"" is fake, and that fucking ghoul [Cyril Wecht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Wecht) who has made a career out of being a professional ghoul.

if the car is theirs, and the valet does not give it to them, that's a Big Fucking Problem, and the valet might even be fired for it, or at least get yelled at by his boss (as well as an irate customer). Certainly no tip will be given.

If the car is NOT theirs and the valet hands it over, that's a problem, but it's a rare problem, and it's one that the valet can - in all honesty and with sincerity - deny responsibility over. ""I was just doing my job, man!"" He might get fired, but it's such a rare event that it's unlikely it'll ever come up.

Ambush attacks and targeted attacks against police are not unheard of (although uncommon). Most likely the killer would be targeting police either in rural areas or in public spaces (ie, walking up to and blasting them at a gas station or while their parked). 

The difficult thing here is that such a killer - almost by nature - would have no connection to his victims, and could be quite difficult to pin down. 

Likely if he's caught it'd be due to some sort of mistake they made, such as being caught on a dash cam or leaving conclusive forensic evidence. There'd be tremendous media and legal pressure to resolve the killings, but that might not make much difference. 

there'd definitely be lots of speculation, theories, and false leads; it would be a very expensive investigation (and if the killer's caught, trial).

In this case there'd probably be some intermediary (a half-breed between a shipping company and an embassy) that took in goods from people and shipped them out via mermaids to other offices, where it would be dispersed.

What's interesting is that there would be (i have to assume!) throughput issues, here: the mermaids only need so many tools, and only have so many mer-people to move things around. So you'd see a tightly restricted flow, after a while, as economies grew and spread. I have to think as human populations grew, they'd come to agreements of the form ""you can have x many tools in exchange for letting us run our ships along this route"", rather than the mermaids themselves doing all the work.

It'd also be pretty interesting because (in theory at least) you could use the restricted capabilities offensively against your foes, without necessarily making it *obvious* you were doing so: just pay them to haul huge amounts of good along one route, so that other routes got neglected, exposing the people so neglected to shortages and hardships - say, before an invasion.

So when a terrorist attack kills a bunch of good looking white people in paris, the world loses it's fucking mind like the sky's falling, but if it's in nigeria people are like ""well, you know, shit happens...it's africa, after all...""

I'd say what you should do is work with the therapist you have to find a new one before he leaves. That way it'd be a kind of continuity, you know? Less disruption, that way.

As to your past and what not, remember: the past, and any problems you've had, can't define you. Only you - the living and breathing you of right now - can define you.

You can have a competing ideology that people prefer enough to make the other one extinct (there have been countless ideologies that got displaced by other ideologies over the course of history). 

You can make the ideology toxic to it's followers (by killing them, mostly, or forbidding them from taking part in any kind of reasonable life until they abandon the ideology). For example, the Mormon Church changed it's (public) stance on polygamy in order to gain more societal acceptance.

You can constantly attack the leaders and organizers, preventing anyone from rising to a point where they could rally people to the cause, and once the current followers are gone there's none left.

There's other ways, too (the story of the [Klan in indiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Klan) is a good example: it went from around 30% adult male membership to nothing in about a decade, due largely to exposed scandals involving it's leadership).

7182,"I dunno that star trek is a good example, for a few reasons. Firstly, star trek had better special effects and plots than almost any other sci-fi when it was released. Secondly, ToS ran for *3 seasons*, which is hardly a one-and-done kind of cult phenomenon. Thirdly, the first movie (released in 1979) was kind of on the coat-tails of a sci-fi revival thanks to Star Wars being released in '77. 

An enormous amount of money, work, and thought went into making TNG into a tremendously reliable show.  Everyone involved did a good job of making a show that no one could say anything really negative about. It certainly was better produced than a lot of prime-time TV even today. 

To me, the example that star trek sets isn't ""you can appeal to a cult fan base"", but ""if you spend the money, time, and talent you can make a franchise that people will not openly abandon"" - and my proof of this is Enterprise, which pretty much no one liked.",2015-10-22 09:21:20+00:00,cw8nwpe,5.0,t1_cw8ftfz,22997.0,SubredditDrama

7192,"It breaks down to a few things:

1) Despite her brash attitude, Carmilla's actually pretty insecure about herself. She's done terrible things, and clearly feels that should play more into Laura's view of her; when it doesn't, she wonders if she really knows her at all.

2) Laura's proclivity for disaster and short-sightedness is alarming to Carmilla; sometimes carmilla must wonder if Laura would consider any sacrifice to far, even losing Carmilla, if it meant doing her notion of the ""right thing"". FWIW, Carmilla's probably spot-on to worry about this; Laura would march everyone into the fire rather than not do the right thing.

2a) Also it should be noticed that on the ""doing good"" front, Carmilla is a backhoe to most people's shovel. She can do tremendous things - for good or ill - and Laura may not realize just how dangerous it is to have that powerful a force available. It's easy to slip into being a tyrant when you have your own personal army, after all...

3) It's likely the case that Carmilla's attitudes towards relationships, commitment, and love are very different than laura's; she's a centuries-old vampire, Laura's a college freshman. Carmilla's willing to devote herself fully to that extreme notion of love, but Laura doesn't even *understand* that kind of love.

So all told - in the end, Carmilla isn't at all sure that loving Laura won't be the doom of them both (and other's beside), or that laura can even love her the way that she loves laura. All of that leads to her doubts.

7468,"Ok, there's 2 aspects here: Conversations and body language. 

For body language, try to appear relaxed. Smile, make eye contact, nod and make positive gestures. Move your arms around when you talk, it makes you look more animated and active. Laugh at things. It's very important for women to have ""open"" body language - arms not crossed, facing the person directly, etc. 

For conversation, remember the FORD memonic: Family, occupation, recreation, dreams. Talk about those things. ""What did you do this weekend?"" ""What is there to do for fun in town this week?"" ""What did you think of &lt;popular movie&gt;"" ""How's your (son/daughter) doing?"" ""What good shows are coming on this winter?"" - all of these are winner topics, and if you stick to the FORD concept you will succeed 9 times out of 10. Ask meaningful questions (""What's that show about?""). If you're asking questions, most people will happily feed you conversation all day and leave feeling like you're a great person. 

With your boyfriend, build a list in your mind of the things he enjoys doing or talking about. bring those things up/suggest you do them. This doesn't have to be all the time, but any effort you put forth is probably going to be sufficient. 

Really though the key to blending in with people is to view it as a sort of video game.

Tales of Maj'eyal - Absolutely superb rogue-like rpg. Top drawer stuff, includes workshop support.

Paranautical activity - very fast-paced shooter. there was some controversy with the devs a while back that really put the pain on it, sadly.

door Kickers - a very fun strategy/puzzle/something game; i really don't know how to define it, but it's awesome. Great modding support, to. 

Hate Plus is an interactive novel/game/something - it stands out in my mind because not only did it make me feel bad once, but it also changed my mind about a character, which almost never happens.

Nidhogg - probably the best in-person PVP game i have ever played. single player mode is also very good. Ignore the horrible graphics, the gameplay is flawless.

Organ Trail - Oregon Trail, with zombies (and some extra features)

Risk of rain - side scrolling arcadey shooter thing, very entertaining, very very difficult.

Space Empires IV - probably the best 4X strategy game ever made.

They Bleed Pixels - platformer, brutally difficult. 

Tower of Guns - FPS roguelike, very challenging and fast-paced, but light-hearted.

Warlock - Master of the Arcane is a game very much like Civ IV with magic.

Spiderweb Software's RPG's (Nethergate/Geneforge/Avernum) are absolutely top-notch isometric RPG's.

7600,"You'd require either a very unique environment (perhaps a huge desert or a vast ice field?) or a very unique requirement (perhaps a specific plane that must be used that has a very short operational range, prohibiting it from being deployed elsewhere). Such a situation could arise if (for example) you had to launch bomber escorts that had much reduced range than the bombers.

Your main issues are going to be mobility (how does it move? how often does it move? what sort of considerations are required for it to move?) and justification for the enormous cost and risks. 

The smallest aircraft carrier i can find is around 500 feet long. Using that as a minimal length, we got some problems. 

A zubr-class Hovercraft - the largest ever created - is about 200 feet long. So this would as long as two and a half Zubr's put together.

The largest self-powered land vehicle on the planet is a [Crawler-Transporter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crawler-transporter) meant to drag the space shuttle to the pad. It's only 131 feet wide (but it's design looks like it'd be amenable to being an aircraft carrier, honestly)

But there is one vehicle - [the Bagger 288](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagger_288) - which is big enough. At full extension it is 721 feet long, a true behemoth. It's externally powered, but it gives some idea of the scale of such a thing. 

Overall though i don't see a reason why something that's (more or less) 5 crawler transporters linked together couldn't suffice as a sort of land-based aircraft carrier, practical considerations aside. The cost would be astounding, but there might be some situation where it'd make sense.

Edit: It occured to me that there may be one scenario where this sort of thing ""makes sense"": there was a plan to deploy ICBM's in what was a sort of dispersed silo, in which crawlers would transport missiles between various bunkers on a gigantic field. The advantage was that the enemy would have to expend a great many of it's own missiles destroying such a site (with no guarantee of actually destroying the missiles). A similar system could be used with this to make a ""mobile air port"" that rolled between a number of huge bunkers; the enemy would n't know which bunker to attack, and the mobile air port could move between them freely, preventing easy targeting. It'd solve almost all the problems - need for special roads etc - while also providing a justification for it to exist at all.",2015-09-23 23:59:30+00:00,cvbzsoq,1.0,t3_3m3q22,16911.0,worldbuilding

3. There's worlds that vary from totally unsettled to medieval to apocalyptic to high-tech, and there's plausible reasons for them all to exist and for there to be diversity of technology. 

4. Everything's just familiar enough that a new reader - picking up a book for the first time - can more-or-less grasp the general idea of what's going on.

1. you need to make it innocuous enough that people don't knee-jerk hate it. 

2. you need to make it concise (or have a snappy short-form name, at least). 

3. It needs to be at least somewhat identifiable to sufferers  

I'd probably go with ""Abnormal Attraction Anonymous"". It's selling points are that it breaks down to ""triple A"" which rolls off the tongue nicely, it harkens to alcoholics anonymous (so you know it's a support group of some kind), and it makes it clear that it's geared towards someone with an issue.

The use of the word ""abnormal"" is a little controversial, perhaps, but it's also plausibly deniable on a letterhead or sign. And i couldn't resist the 3-letter abbreviation. Talk about muddying the waters - someone trying to google why their neighbor's ""going to triple a"" would surely come away confused. 

Another option might be something like ""Support for People Attracted to Children"" which shortens to ""SNAC"" which is snappy enough, and the full name is very clear (and apt to turn up in google searches etc for people looking for support groups). 

Might be possible to go off a person's name, too - but that loses any call to sufferers, so they'd need some other way to ""spread the word"". But you could easily call it (for example) something like ""Polly's group"" or what have you. 

It's a pretty interesting challenge. I gotta think going with ""Virtuous pedophiles"" is not the ideal choice, though. ",2015-08-19 12:56:49+00:00,cu86sye,5.0,t1_cu7syxn,38420.0,SubredditDrama

So, we get out there and she pops the driver's side door, leans in, and like something out of a horror movie, swings up with a fucking putty knife and proceeds to assault her boyfriend with it. 

Luckily, he was pretty pro and deflected the first hit and then moved out of the way while someone grabbed her and she went full on berserker while her boyfriend got in the car and took off.

Here she was actually blackout drunk, and had just been faking being a reasonable human being up until that moment. Next morning she woke up with no clue why everyone was pissed at her. This was, for her, a regular occurrence.

8388,"Actually no! that's something i do know about, because of one specific appraiser - [Elyse Luray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elyse_Luray). In trying to find out about her, i learned a lot about Antiques Roadshow and how they appraise shit. Basically: there are auctions for shit. Say, guns or civil war memorabilia, or what have you. And those auctions have appraisers that determine how much stuff is worth. The appraiser may very well be state-licensed in some capacity. 

As to actual appraisals, to my understanding, it's almost all experience at play and looking at past auctions and past valuations. So like if some guy rolls in with a Japanese skull from Okinawa or something, they would look at previous sales of Japanese skulls (and what those items were like in comparison) and then at how often they come up at auction and how intently people bid for them. Then they'd kind of judge condition and craftsmanship (is it totally bleached? did someone attach trench art to it, or is it just the bare skull? is the skull in good condition, does it have an interesting wound or what?) and then they would figure out the value-guess from that. 

of course, when it goes to auction it could go for more or less than expected, and it gets a lot trickier if it's a one-of-a-kind item or something really obscure. Pretty much anyone will buy a trocar from 1915, but only a true collector would buy a hat-pin from 1980. ",2015-07-23 15:05:19+00:00,ctdekrp,5.0,t1_ctdcx4u,2709.0,SubredditDrama

More cars on the road means more chances for bad things to happen. Let's say the odds of forgetting a kid in a car are - i dunno, 1 in 1000, let's say. If there's 10,000 families with cars, then there's 10 incidents; if there's 20,000 there'd be 20 etc. I mean that's obviously simplified, but that's the idea. To take houston as an example, it's grown by about 120,000 people in the past four years - that's a a lot of people, and more chances.

Definitely rear-facing seats and busy lifestyles play a role. I'd say our ""culture of distraction"" is an issue, too, but i don't have any way of quantifying it. 

I helped raise my brothers, for years. I was 10 when my oldest brother was born, 17 when the youngest was; my mother was a single mom for most of that, so i would help out as best i could and keep an eye on them and whatnot. It was incredibly stressful, but the main take-aways that i learned was to always do headcounts, always know where they are supposed to be, and check up check up check up to be sure they are. To this day the first thing i ask my brother when he says he's going somewhere is ""Where are you going? When will you be back?"" Safety culture's kind of second nature, i guess.

Parenting is not an auto-pilot job. It's not a job where you can become complacent. They became complacent. They made bad choices that, at every turn, lead them to the negligent act. They choose to (evidently) exhaust themselves at a park. They chose to go take a nap. They choose not to double check the car. They chose to (apparently) take in the other kids, but not do a headcount, not even notice one of them was gone.

As to the strangeness of the 30 minutes they were giving CPR and on the phone with 911, i can offer no explanation at all, which is troubling. 

This isn't a case of parents caught in the throes of some unavoidable situation; it's not a situation that could not be avoided or that any parent could have happen. This was parents who were over-extending themselves, complacent in their duty, and who failed to practice common sense and good policy.

the universe hopping is trivial enough to set up with basic gurps rules (or be a purely narrative event). Rarely do the characters have any control over the more mystical events.

The rest of the stuff would just be setting up the various races, figuring out just *how* good the gun characters are (are they as god as nearly-god Roland, or are they merely skilled gunsmen?), and what kind of equipment they have.

I might house rule stuff about ammunition and supplies (since that's such a big part of the books) but beyond that i don't see any reason in particular to not just go with basic set + gun fu and maybe High Tech/ultratech (albeit the high-tech artifacts would be hyper-rare).

He circumcised his own prick, in his bathroom, with an x-acto knife.  There was blood on the *ceiling*. Of course he botched it and had to go to the hospital. He dropped out of school and, so far as i am aware, never graduated.

So the funny part, after the school hears about his desperate act we have a good chuckle at his expense, including mock re-enactments and tormenting his cousins about it. And then someone says:

""He HAD a freak dick, but now i bet he's got a *Frankenstein dick*!""

Cue laughter from all in attendance, and questions to his (female) cousin if she saw his ""Frankenstein dick"".

9072,"Some thoughts on each entry:

1. amusingly, clive barker's ""Scarlet Gospels"" have totally and utterly confused the issue of who pinhead is and what he wants.

2. Peter Watts did a great short story called ""The Things"" that talks about the mindset of the creature, and how it is, in truth, just doing what it does and isn't really evil per se. My own favorite theory is that the time in the ice gave it brain damage, and it was operating at a much reduced, bestial capacity; it's normal mode of operation must have been much higher, to build spaceships and all.

3. Dekker's kind of a mixed bag as a villian. On the one hand he's definitely evil, on the other hand that evil is serving a slightly greater good (for the moment, at least).

4. the Predator (or Yautja) are actually text-book evil to me. Their totally selfish, self-centered, and ignorant to the validity of other ways of living and other lives. 

5. Vampires have always been sort of the prototype ""monster-victim"". Their monsters, yes - but only because of circumstance. Of course, they can embrace their dark nature. One thing i liked about the Twilight franchise is that it shows two types of vampires: those that sort of accept this ""gift"" and fit in with humans as best they can, and those that just go full on psycho-dark.

Another big one might be if a country launched an attack on the vatican, and (for whatever reason) the rest of the world refused to sanction them for it. A firebrand pope (or one who was deranged because of the attack) could call for it. 

It'd be a big (even huge) deal, and not something the church would take lightly, or that the world would sit idly by for. The only question would be if anyone cared enough to try and stop them (or if the risks of stopping them outweighed the likelyhood of further uprisings).

9309,"Incredibly enough, i found that replacing AE2 with Project E was net-beneficial for the server over a long period of time:

1. People didn't feel a need to ""hold onto"" literally millions of cobble /sand/gravel/etc for no discernible reason

2. People didn't have enormous AE systems running 24/7 dealing with enormous feed stock inputs and processing systems. I did not realize how much of a drag on a server this was until we didn't have to deal with it anymore.

We just dumped stuff into the ProjectE network and pulled stuff out as necessary. It totally liberated us from the enormous drag of the usual midgame (or, as i like to call it ""build giant quarries and enormous mob traps, then profit!""). 

The end effect was pretty much identical to AE (""oh, i need 1024 diamonds...better pull those out of storage!"") but without any of the overhead or annoyances of the AE-type systems. 

It's not for everyone (and notably, i think most servers would want to turn off the automatic generation of points) but it definitely was very enjoyable and very liberating when we did it. ",2015-06-16 11:57:55+00:00,cs89d3s,5.0,t1_cs87sh6,5863.0,feedthebeast
