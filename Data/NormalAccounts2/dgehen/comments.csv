26,"Personally, I really enjoyed X-O #50 (and the arc as a whole). Yes, I understand it was the big finale and people may have expected a big, fist-pumping battle or even a heroic sacrifice, but for the series to end on an action-packed note would be to miss the point of Venditti's run as a whole. X-O #50 is the culmination of Aric's journey from brave and brutal warrior to wise king. 

Do I think the Torment was set up and dealt with a little hastily? Yes, but I can overlook that because they aren't the focus of this arc - Aric is. Do I think Trill will honor the agreement with Aric forever? No, but that's okay because the point is Aric was able to come up with a workable peace agreement with his most persistent antagonist.

One last thing I want to address. I understand the appeal of Aric sacrificing himself to wipe out the Torment, let's be real for a moment - Valiant isn't taking one of their biggest players off the table when they're just starting to branch out into other media.

I like the unfiltered version a lot more. It's a movie that takes place during one of the more brutal and violent wars in history, and the more naturalistic look does a better job capturing that in my opinion.

On a somewhat related note, I don't think a filter makes a movie look more ""cinematic"" or ""epic."" Just look at some of the great films of the past, like Ben Hur or Lawrence of Arabia. Amazing, epic feats of cinema that didn't have a filter. What gives a movie that type of aesthetic has more to do with what's captured by the camera, not by what's applied in post-production.

However, that changed as soon as the second issue was released. Then it became its own thing, with its own characters, personalities, and stories to tell. You should check out the 61 other issues from that original Mirage run. Or the 16 issues in Volume 2. Or the 32 issues of Volume 4. Or the current series by IDW Publishing.

The 1987 television show wasn't a parody of the era's cartoons, it was created to sell toys. Eastman and Laird had struck a licensing deal with Playmates, who in turn reached out to Fred Wolf Studios to create a 5-episode show to function as an extended commercial.

Here's the thing, when I was getting back into comics, exclusively was reading Batman stuff. However, my local Borders (remember them?) was going out of business, so I was able to pick up a bunch of trades. Among them was *The Flash: Rebirth* (the one you picked up).

So I read it. And like you, I was confused. What the hell is with the gorillas? What's a Black Flash? Who's Savitar? So I did a little digging and discovered all of these great Flash stories from the 1950s to today. There's the legendary runs by Mark Waid and Geoff Johns. The trippy 12-issue run by Grant Morrison and Mark Millar. Older gems like ""The Flash of Two Worlds"" and ""The Flash--Fact or Fiction?""

We had a melancholy movie in Man of Steel and a dark movie in Batman v Superman. You site him learning how to be a hero, but we never see that process. From a narrative perspective, we have not been given a reason to care about Superman, and that comes back to the story failing to give Cavil an opportunity to emote and inject some charisma into the role.

Superman (not Clark, but Superman) has been a character in these films that shows up and either pouts or grimaces. Why should I care that he dies at the end? My knowledge of the character from outside sources tells me I should care, but I don't really have an in-movie reason to care.

My favorite scene in the DCEU right now (and probably for many others) is the ""first flight"" sequence from Man of Steel.

380,"When this came out, I thought it did a better job at telling a story than the comic. Looking back on it, I feel that the comic is a much stronger work. It's better paced, and has core emotional beats that the movie never hits - especially the ""goodbye"" scene between Barry and his mother. The ""Batman letter"" is another strong beat that plays better in the comic, despite Kevin Conroy's great voice acting.

With that said, I don't think Flashpoint (or the Flashpoint Paradox) is a particularly good story. Many people seem to give it a pass because Geoff Johns wrote it. It's also a story that gets a lot of hype because it's a Flash-centric event. Yes, it is, but at the same time it's a story that betrays the core characteristics of many heroes in the DC Universe - especially Aquaman, Wonder Woman, and Barry Allen himself.

I know the point of the story is to show how messing with the timeline can really screw up the world, but these characters are supposed to endure and be beacons of light no matter the circumstances. That right there puts the story completely at odds with its characters. 

I can live with the Thomas Wayne Batman and Skinny Supes, but there are other decisions which make no sense. Abin Sur crashes on Earth and his ring just flies away, only for Hal Jordan to still be a part of the story? Okay. Aquaman still has his half-surface, half-Atlantean heritage, so why is he suddenly a tyrant completely against the world? Why are the Amazons, which for centuries have been a culture about peace and diplomacy rather than combat-first, invading and taking over sovereign nations? It's a story that is full of cool ideas that fall apart when you take a moment to think about them.

Now, just because I think it's a bad story doesn't mean I don't enjoy it. I like a lot of things which I know are objectively bad, like the new Ninja Turtles movie, or Burger King's Mac 'n' Cheetos.",2016-06-29 15:34:39+00:00,d4snhs4,1.0,t3_4nqk9o,1471041.0,FlashTV

- The Flash: The Dastardly Death of the Rogues
- The Flash: Road to Flashpoint

438,"First, that story where Batman becomes a vampire, it's from an imprint called ""Elseworlds"" where creators were allowed to take characters and play around with them outside of continuity. There's also one where Batman takes on Jack the Ripper, and it's pretty great.

But more to your point, I think this is a response to when comic book films were first coming out (mostly the Superman and Batman films) and movie execs and screenwriters felt there was no need to consider the comic books as a source of inspiration. As a result, we got Superman III, Superman IV, Batman Forever, and Batman &amp; Robin.

Personally, I think the approach which has worked best - and what is likely the approach Affleck will follow - is to take inspiration from the best written comic stories while crafting a new and original story. *Batman Begins* was not a direct adaptation of *Batman: Year One* or ""Batman: The Man Who Falls"", but it borrowed from those stories. *The Dark Knight* was not a direct adaptation of *The Long Halloween* or *Batman: The Man Who Laughs*, but it borrowed from those stories.

Mike Grell's run in the late 1980s and early 1990s is fantastic, starting with *The Longbow Hunters* miniseries and then continuing into the proper *Green Arrow* ongoing series. Kevin Smith's run, consisting of the arcs *Quiver* and *The Sounds of Violence* is also top notch, as is the follow-up by Brad Meltzer - *The Archer's Quest*. Judd Winnick's *Green Arrow/Black Canary* series is also worth checking out.

However, I'm talking about the overall reception, and the overall reception was not good. Yes, the movie was profitable, but the first movie to ever feature Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman together should not have sputtered out at under $900M globally.

511,"Hey guys,

To answer this month's discussion point, I'd like to see titles that are driven by the team that the player chooses (R/B/Y), as well as based on how a player approaches gameplay. For example, leveling up and swapping pokemon in and out of your lineup may earn you the title of **Jr. Trainer**, while using a lot of Rock-types may make you a **Hiker**. More importantly, a player can change their approach to gameplay, and therefore earn the right to change titles so that they aren't pigeon-holed as a **Bug-Catcher** forever. 

Also, I know I'm late to the game (just discovered your podcast last week), but I'd be Team Red all the way. And Bulbasaur is my #2 starter after Charmander (sorry Squirtle Squad).",2016-05-11 20:18:29+00:00,d31rv8p,1.0,t3_4giv2q,1319605.0,PokemonGoPodcast

Here's a summary: After Barry killed the Reverse Flash in the mid-1980s, he ""retired"" to the 30th Century, where it was discovered that Iris (who had been killed years prior), was resurrected by her parents, who originally were from that era. Barry and Iris eventually had kids, who (because of their father) had powers of their own and went by the moniker ""The Tornado Twins."" One of the two, Don Allen, married Meloni Thawne (yes, *that* Thawne) had a child, Bart. Bart was then sent back in time to the 20th/21st century to train under Barry's successor, Wally West, after Barry ""died"" in Crisis on Infinite Earths.",2016-04-15 20:12:31+00:00,d24fo8l,2.0,t1_d23nu05,53585.0,FlashTV

Speaking from experiences as a runner, training for a race involves repetitions of much shorter distances at a faster pace. If someone runs a 5K race (3.1 miles) at a 6 minute-per-mile pace, their workout might be to run 400M (~1/4 mile) at a 5 minute-per-mile pace, repeated 8 times.

It may sound silly to some, but Barry gaining speed by simply ""running faster"" is fairly practical. Now, the fact that he's manages to become exponentially faster after a pep talk, that's some Speedforce shit.",2016-03-15 14:01:39+00:00,d10lh91,1.0,t3_4affx7,56574.0,FlashTV
711,"I think the issue is simply the manner in which you approach it. If the show was a first-hand account of Barry Allen's experiences, then yes I would agree with your stance on this matter. However, that is not the case. 

The Reverse Flash vibrating to hide his identity is intended for the audience and non-powered characters on the show, not Barry.  It may not make 100% sense, but it works in terms of effective storytelling presentation. If in S01E09, Reverse Flash wasn't vibrating because Barry could ""see"" it, there would be no mystery. That moment at the end of the episode would have zero impact. Early in the episode it would be ""oh, that's Tom Cavanagh. Looks like Wells is the Reverse Flash."" I'm okay with them sacrificing a bit of logic here and there for a better overall story.

However, if there needs to be an in-story explanation, I'll do my best. Season 1 Reverse Flash was a seasoned veteran that had honed his skills for years and knew to vibrate at a frequency that was difficult for Barry to match with his ""speed vision."" The RF we saw this season was just starting out and didn't have that ability mastered, which is why when Barry was face-to-face with him, he appeared to stop vibrating.",2016-03-15 13:49:18+00:00,d10l2j7,1.0,t3_4ahkf0,19825.0,FlashTV

717,"I'm not serving up an indictment of the show, just little tweaks that I personally would've done differently (since that is the question posted). It is possible to love a show and offer up points of criticism or dissenting opinion. 

Zoom is a fascinating villain, and a true force of nature on the show. However, where you find his desire to be the best simple and effective, I still find it to be lacking. Neither is right or wrong, it's just a matter of personal preference.

And since we're on the subject of Zoom, I'd also change it so that he has his ability to manipulate time to give off the appearance of speed, rather than being a straight-up speedster. Obviously, being a speedster works for the overall narrative that they're working with (Velocity 9, Jay Garrick, etc.), but I always found Zoom's comic powers a unique twist on the evil speedster concept.",2016-03-14 20:48:15+00:00,d0zsh6p,3.0,t1_d0zriwv,1280.0,FlashTV

720,"I wouldn't do much differently, just some minor tweaks here and there.

- I'd be sure that instead of referring to a certain character as ""Evil Wells"", the characters would call him ""Thawne"" instead. I'd also bring back the Reverse Flash a little more frequently.

- I probably wouldn't have done the villain bait-and-switch with Jay Garrick - it feels a little repetitive from last season.

- Zoom needs a better motivation than ""I want to steal his speed"". Why does he want to steal it? I'd like a compelling reason other than ""to be the fastest.""

- Zoom's costume would probably be more reminiscent of the [New 52 Reverse Flash design](http://files1.comics.org//img/gcd/covers_by_id/924/w400/924530.jpg?9060600964732895209), since his current look takes the [Black Flash](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/theflash/images/f/f6/275px-blk_flash.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20090117032046) off the table.

There was so much about this episode that was just cut out of this synopsis. Where was the bit about Max being released? The shady cops (and plot twist)? Kat introducing Siobbhan to the office?

829,"Sorry, but I have to disagree. That's a very surface-level comparison that shows a lack of understanding of Marvel and DC characters. For example, Superman IS Clark Kent. His respect for human life, his morality, and his kindness are traits that he was raised to believe in by Jonathan and Martha Kent. His heroism is defined by both his upbringing and his personal relationships. He may be Kryptoninan in biology, but he does not lack humanity. 

Superman/Batman #3 says it best: ""It is a remarkable dichotomy. In many ways, Clark is the most human of us all. Then...he shoots fire from the skies, and it is difficult not to think of him as a god. And how fortunate we all are that it does not occur to him.""

887,"One of the biggest problems for **Season 3**, for me, was that Oliver's ""identity crisis"" didn't feel like a natural progression for the character. After showing a progression from vigilante to something heroic during S1 &amp; S2, Oliver kind of meandered in a state in-between the two for most of S3. Yes, he still loses his company to Ray, but instead of spending all of his screentime on Arrow scenes, we also see him begin to rebuild his image as a champion of the people - volunteering at soup kitchens, leading philanthropic endeavors, etc. Note to the show's writers: losing your company is not the same as losing your family's accumulated wealth.

I wouldn't have brought Merlyn in as a morally ambiguous character. He was originally cunning, manipulative, and evil. He should have always stayed as such. Thea stays by her father's side, serving as another antagonist throughout the season and into the next.

I'd flip the villains for season 3 &amp; 4. Have Darhk and HIVE be the villain for season 3, building up to Ras for Season 4. Nyssa could still show up because of her connection to Sarah, but her main purpose is to perform intel and carry out assassinations for the League of Assassins in a covert war against HIVE.

I wouldn't have killed off Sarah in the opener. Instead, in a city-wide attack targeting Team Arrow, Dinah Lance (Laurel and Sarah's mom) is killed. The guilt of bringing this pain to her family causes Sarah to leave Starling City, and the anger of feeling helpless to do anything sends Laurel down the path to becoming Black Canary.

Felicity maintains the role she had played through S3, and after the will-they-won't-they thing established with Barry is laid to rest, she begins a relationship with Ray Palmer and stays with him throughout the entire season, ending it with his ""death"" in the finale. Season 3 ends with a tease of Ra's - perhaps with Nyssa returning to Nanda Parbat after Darhk's defeat - but nothing more.

I don't have a clear picture for what I would do with **Season 4** because of how much the dynamics have changed in my version of S3, so instead I'll just do a brief outline. Ra's and the League are the main, season long villains.  He is introduced early and brings Oliver to the brink of death in an early encounter. This sends Oliver on a journey to uncover a means to defeat him. Instead of going to Merlyn for advice, he goes to Katana, which results in a loose adaptation of the *Outsiders War* arc. Oliver manages to unite the various clans and returns to Star City with them for a showdown against Ra's, who has the city under siege.",2016-02-16 14:51:30+00:00,d01wzfa,1.0,t3_461yhn,14447.0,arrow

Green Arrow, conversely, does not such a history. He's known as working alone or, at most, with two partners. He doesn't have an army of vigilantes like he does on *Arrow.*

981,"**Crisis on Infinite Earths** is an interesting case because it's effectively wiping out the DC Universe of that era. After that story, things (sort of) start from scratch, with Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman getting new/updated origins in *Man of Steel*, *Year One*, and *Gods &amp; Mortals* (respectively). With that said, you can still read *Crisis on Infinite Earths*, but be warned that the writing is a bit clunky and dated.

If you really want to jump into **The Flash**, there are a lot of recommendations you're likely to hear, especially the Mark Waid and Geoff Johns runs. The problem is Waid's run is out of print (though it looks like DC is actually going to start reprinting it in September). However, the Waid run lays the foundation for the modern Flash mythos (including a lot of what you see on the show).

Another of the more likely recommendations you'll hear is *The Flash: Rebirth*. It may be difficult to follow (I personally don't think it is) because it relies on a lot of previously established material, which is out of print.

Based on availability and ease of entry for a new reader, I'd recommend going with the following:

 - The Flash: The Dastardly Death of the Rogues

- The Flash: The Road to Flashpoint

- Flashpoint

- The Flash Vol.1: Move Forward

- The Flash Vol.2: Rogues Revolution

- The Flash Vol.3: Gorilla Warfare

- The Flash Vol.4: Reverse

**Aquaman** is really easy: read the New 52 written by Geoff Johns and Jeff Parker. Those are fantastic comics. There's one issue by Parker in which Aquaman attends his high school reunion - it's amazing. If you want to go outside the box, check out the *Sub-Diego* story arc.

**Batman** is an interesting case, because you can just read the New 52 series and be good, but there is so much great material that is no longer canon that is easily worth picking up. 

New 52 recommendations:

- Batman Vol.1-7

- Detective Comics Vol.3-7

- Batman &amp; Robin Vol.1-7

Great ""non-canon"" stories:

- Gotham Central Vol.1-4

Okay, that brings us to **Justice League**. There are a lot of great Justice League stories from various eras worth checking out.

Older, non-canon recommendations:

- Justice League International Vol. 1-6 by Keith Giffen, J.M. DeMatteis, and Kevin Macguire

- I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League

- Formerly Known as the Justice League

- JLA Vol.1-4

New 52 Recommendations:

- Justice League Vol.1,3,,6-7 (I recommend tracking down the back issues for the current story: the Darkseid War. It starts at issue #40)

- Justice League Dark Vol.1-3

- Justice League United Vol.1-3

Now, I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to the Marvel Universe, but when it comes to **Daredevil** I'd recommend the following:

- The Frank Miller run

- The Brian Michael Bendis run

- The Mark Waid run

1035,"This is by no means a perfect list, as different people have different tastes. Also, various titles can be interchanged or swapped out with others, but I'd go with the following six:

1. Superman: Secret Identity -  A great Superman story that defies expectations.

2. We3 - A short story (3 issues) that manages to hit hard emotionally while achieving a level of hyper-violence that has an impact on the narrative, rather than just being there ""because it can be.""

3. Fables - A very accessible comic that takes familiar, childhood characters and takes them in a direction that many would not expect. Fantastic storytelling and artwork makes the series excel well beyond the novelty of the concept.

4. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - to many outside of comics, especially adults, the TMNT are a bit of a joke. An artifact of the 1980s and 1990s that don't have a place in today's world. After reading the first trade of the current series by IDW, they'd be proven wrong. Solid artwork combines with mysticism, sci-fi, criminal power struggles and family drama for a complete and colorful series.

5. Death Defying Doctor Mirage - Horror and the supernatural are prominently featured in this Valiant series. The emotional hook of the character's motivations makes it easy for most to jump on board. 

6. Ms. Marvel - If you were wondering where the book is that captures the good old-fashioned fun of classic superhero comics, but written and illustrated for today's sensibilities, then this series is perfect.

Currently, **[Dinah] Laurel Lance**. Not for the pro/anti-Felicity sentiments that are commonly brought up, but because of her journey. Seriously, the girl's been through some dark shit.

She lost her boyfriend, only to find out that he was seeing her sister behind her back. As a result, she isn't able to truly mourn either because she was angry at both. Then, she and Tommy find each other, and their pain turns into love for one another (I've seen this happen first hand), only for Oliver to come back from the dead. Then, right after she and Tommy break things off, he dies trying to save her.

Blaming herself for these things, she begins a descent into pills and alcohol addiction, pushing everyone away. During this period - surprise - Sarah comes back from the dead too, and her romance with Oliver continues. Only then Sarah is ripped from her life again.

So now, she's lost her sister twice (and Tommy), she's an addict, the man she long ago thought she would marry has moved on, and she's angry because she feels completely helpless. What does she do? She begins channeling that anger in to a desire to help others. She trains, first with Wildcat and then with Nyssa, and redeems herself into a hero.

Potentially, given enough screen time and development, **Patty Spivot** could become my new favorite. She's strong willed and spunky, but there is a darkness behind that smile. And no, she's not Zoom! Enough with that shit!",2015-12-14 19:44:07+00:00,cxyz7g2,1.0,t3_3wl7pa,153089.0,arrow

The first thing I noticed about this comic was the art. Freddie Williams' style appears to be strongly influenced by classic Frank Miller, and by extension Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird. Because of that, the issue felt like a natural extension of the Mirage comics, at least aesthetically. The Turtles, Killer Croc, and Shredder all looked fantastic. Unfortunately, Batman himself was a bit lacking. For me, he was a little too barrel-chested for his own good.

As for the story itself, it was a solid opening chapter. Major plot beats and motivations remain a mystery, so the main focus was establishing the characters. Even though Tynion's been writing Batman comics for a few years now, the Turtles felt more true to themselves than the Dark Knight. The banter among the brothers was enjoyable without being overplayed. I can't wait for the next issue.

Gotham... it is what it is. Some people love it. Some don't. I personally swing back and forth on the subject. One episode I'll be completely enamored, while the next makes me want to swear off the show completely.

1287,"***Imperium:*** I thought it was solid, but not spectacular, until the most recent issue. Before then, this seemed mostly like a revenge tale, and I think Harada would be above pettiness when his ambitions are grand. Dysart really stepped up his game and inject that book with a lot of social and political commentary. I hope that continues for the foreseeable future. **B**

***Bloodshot Reborn:*** This is arguably Valiant's best title. Yes, it's slower than the previous Bloodshot series, but that's because it's a deconstruction of the character that is focusing on storytelling and character development first, action second. And I thought Mico Suayan's art on that first arc was phenomenal. **A**

***Unity:*** I agree that the title as a whole has been a bit rudderless, each individual arc has been enjoyable. Even the ""War Monger"" arc, which was rough for the most part, was salvaged with a great final issue. **B**

***Ivar, Timewalker:*** This is one of two books I look forward to each month. Just a lot of fun. **A**

***Ninjak:*** This book could be a lot better, and it is improving with each issue. Though the art has been fantastic, the real strength is the way Kindt peels back the layers of Ninjak's past through flashbacks which tie into the events of the main narrative. Also, I'm a sucker for multi-narrative storytelling. **B+**

***Rai:*** Without Clayton Crain's art, I'm not sure I'd actually read this book. The first arc was interesting, but the second arc has been frustratingly slow. Slow arcs can be a good thing, but the script fails to provide any emotional hook to keep me invested. At least it looks really good. **C**",2015-10-13 17:46:15+00:00,cvyd72w,1.0,t3_3nw55w,504546.0,valiant

As far as an event, probably something to incorporate the best elements of the post-Flashpoint DCU with the pre-Flashpoint DCU, which is what it seems like they're starting to do. There are two things I'd try to fix.

1. Earth 2 would maybe skip ahead 20-30 years give us a more ""classic"" JSA.

2. The Flash Family would be truly built up - with Barry as Flash, Wally as Kid Flash, Bart as Impulse - Max Mercury and Jessie Quick in tow as well. Jay would be there too thanks to #1.

The bigger changes would be with editorial. Harras is out the door. Didio is moved into a marketing capacity. He may not be the best decision maker, but I think he does bring a love and passion for DC which would work well in marketing.

The biggest thing is that we make a big course correction by bringing back Mark Waid as Editor in Chief. Geoff Johns remains Chief Creative Officer, Jim Lee is co-publisher.

Ongoing series would be cut down to 40, with 4-8 different miniseries running instead with the intent of giving other characters a spotlight, or just to let creators try something different a la New Frontier or The Golden Age.",2015-09-29 17:28:10+00:00,cviacwo,1.0,t3_3mq5gs,85037.0,DCcomics

1356,"Just to break it down really simply, ""Reverse Flash"" is a title to refer to *most* (not all) of speedster villains of The Flash. There have been 3 official Reverse Flashes:

1. Eobard Thawne (Professor Zoom): Psychopath from the 25th Century; primarily an antagonist of Barry Allen.

2. Hunter Zoloman (Zoom): Former FBI profiler who gained his powers from misuse of the Cosmic Treadmill; primarily an antagonist of Wally West.

3. Daniel West (Reverse Flash): Brother of Iris West who gains his powers from a Speed Force-related accident; primarily an antagonist of Barry Allen.

There are other villainous speedsters in the DCU that are enemies of The Flash. However, they are not considered ""Reverse Flashes."" These include:

1. Dr. Edward Clariss (The Rival): Professor at Jay Garrick's university that recreated the formula that turned Garrick into the Flash; primarily an antagonist of Jay Garrick.

2. Savitar: Former Eastern Bloc pilot who attained his powers from a freak accident involving his plane and the Speed Force, now considers himself a disciple of the Speed Force; primarily an antagonist of Wally West.

3. Thaddeus Thawne (Inertia): Clone of from the 30th Century where the Allen/Thawne feud continues to be strong; primarily an antagonist of Bart Allen.

4. Malcolm Thawne (Cobalt Blue): Evil twin brother of Barry Allen who uses the Thawne family talisman to steal the speed of other speedsters; primarily an antagonist of Wally West.

How will this translate to this season's villain, ""Zoom""? Well, that's up for debate. The likely scenario is that they pick and choose elements from these other speedsters. At the end of the day, we'll just have to wait and see how it plays out. 

EDIT: There's one other villainous speedster I forgot to mention: The Black Flash. This is death incarnate for DCU speedsters - basically their Grim Reaper.",2015-09-28 20:35:07+00:00,cvhao0h,1.0,t3_3mpyw5,12514.0,FlashTV
1357,"With most comic writers, the reader can usually uncover all the layers to the story upon first read. Morrison is not like that. His works demand multiple reads to be fully appreciated.

I see a lot of complaints about Morrison about how his works are too confusing, or that he's all over the place, or that they just don't ""get"" him. The reason for this is that you can't approach one of his comics like one of your regular monthly pulls. You can't just plug through a Morrison story and expect to get it - you need to slow down, pour over the words, then the art, and then the words again. Then, once you've made your way through the story, read it again.

There is perhaps no better example of this than *Final Crisis.* When I first read it, I had no clue what was going on. Then I read it again, and it became clearer. And then I read it a third time. Then a fourth. Each time I read it, I get something new out of it. That's what makes Morrison great.

1441,"On /u/dmull387's suggestion, definitely pick up The Flash Vol. 1-4 from the New 52. I would also add The Flash Vol.5. It isn't as great as Vol.1-4, but they are fun little stories - especially the team-up with Green Lantern.

If you want to go pre-New 52, you can check out some classic Barry Allen stories in The Silver Age Flash Omnibus, The Flash of Two Worlds HC, or the more affordable Flash Chronicles. You might want to check out Crisis on Infinite Earths as well.

Moving on from Barry, I'd recommend some of Wally West's run. Unfortunately, much of it is uncollected, but you can track down used trade paperbacks, dollar-bin back-issues, or digital copies. The stories I'd check out are Born to Run, The Return of Barry Allen, Terminal Velocity, Dead Heat, and Chain Lightning - all written by Mark Waid. 

Other Wally stories to check out include The Human Race and Emergency Stop co-written by Grant Morrison and Mark Millar. From there, you can check out Geoff Johns' Wally run, which includes great stories like Blitz and Rogue War. You can track those down in either trade or omnibus form.

Finally, once you've made your way through that stuff, you can dive into Barry's true return as the Flash. While it actually happens in Final Crisis, you need a PhD in DC History to fully understand it. Instead, jump straight to Flash: Rebirth, followed by The Dastardly Death of the Rogues, The Road to Flashpoint, and then Flashpoint. Flashpoint leads into the New 52, which means we've come full circle.

Now, when it comes to all the pre-Flashpoint stuff, reading stuff in chronological order is important. One of the things that made the Flash such an acclaimed comic franchise is the legacy it established. It's mythology builds on itself, so jumping around will not have the same impact as reading the stories in order and seeing the natural progression of things.",2015-09-03 13:18:09+00:00,cup7c5t,1.0,t3_3jg7oz,32659.0,DCcomics

1457,"- *Batman* - because it's Batman. And it's been great since issue #1.

- *Justice League* - picked up up after Forever Evil, and it's shown steady improvement each issue. The Darkseid War is shaping up to be a modern classic.

- *The Flash* - I'm hoping it eventually turns around, because I'd hate to drop my favorite character's title.

- *Sensation Comics* - I want to support Wonder Woman, so I might as well pick up the good title.

- *Action Comics* - Pak is writing the best Superman since Morrison's *Action* run concluded. Kuder's artwork is great too.

- *Grayson* - This book is just fantastic. A near-perfect series.

- *Black Canary* - not nearly as good as *Grayson*, but Wu's artwork alone is worth picking it up. Also, after the first few issues, the writing has seemed to find its footing.

- *Starfire* - this is just a fun title, and Lupacchino is crushing it on art.

- *Secret Six* - a weird dark comedy that reintroduced Elongated Man into the DCU. Also, great team dynamics, and I trust Gail after the previous volume of the title (pre-Flashpoint).

- *Omega Men* - I have no idea what's really going on here, but all I know is that I love it. More people need to buy this.

- *Prez* - probably DC's best book at the moment. Too bad not many are reading it. Smart and sharply written, this speaks to many of the problems facing society today.

1572,"I think that The Return of Barry Allen is considered the best Flash story, which is a consensus I agree with. Personally, I find Flashpoint too inconsistent to be considered a great story. It's an important Flash story, but it is far from Johns' best, let alone the Flash's best.

Rebirth, on the other hand, is full of so many elements that made The Flash one of DC's most rich mythos. Barry's returned from ""death"" and must deal with a world that is much faster than the one he left. The extended Flash family plays a big role, as well as elements that Waid and Morrison/Millar introduced during their runs in the 1990s (Speed Force and Black Flash, respectively). There's a now iconic moment that calls back to the numerous Flash/Superman races.

The only story that comes close, in my opinion, to being a celebration of the Flash's history is Mark Waid's *Chain Lightning*, which again remains uncollected.

EDIT: The Flashpoint may be a decent entry-point for fans, but the comic relies heavily on readers already knowing the [recent] history of the character. Also, both the movie and the comic require readers to have an emotional attachment to the established, canonized version of DC's many characters. That's what makes their appearances in Flashpoint so interesting. The opening sequence of the movie does help remove some of the confusion, but it doesn't fully eliminate it.",2015-08-03 13:43:01+00:00,ctpv98r,4.0,t1_ctpp2uc,21590.0,theflash

1720,"**Alex + Ada #15:** I hope this finale emotionally destroys me.

**Black Canary #1:** Annie Wu and Brendan Fletcher taking Dinah on a rock tour? I'm game.

**Bloodshot Reborn #3:** It's a Valiant book. Of course it's good.

**Escape From New York #7:** I fell off a few issues ago, but I can't stay away from Snake Plissken's adventures for too long.

**Fiction #1:** I have no clue what this is about, but it looks interesting enough to give the first issue a shot.

**Giant Days #4:** Just a fun ride.

**Harley Quinn &amp; Power Girl #1:** Palmiotti and Conner writing PeeGee? That's a no brainer.

**Ivar, Timewalker #6:** Easily the best time-travel comic I've read in quite a while.

**Justice League of America #1:** I'm still 50/50 if I'm going to pick this up. I love Bryan Hitch's art, but his writing leaves a lot to be desired.

**Secret Six #3:** Hopefully this series continues to improve while avoiding further delays. What happened last issue?

**Sensation Comics #11:** I'm glad I can get my fix of good Wonder Woman comics here.

**X-O Manowar #37:** X-O Manowar and a bunch of space-soldiers take on an intergalactic threat for the fate of the world. ",2015-06-16 17:15:34+00:00,cs8js1t,1.0,t3_3a01ra,47036.0,comicbooks
