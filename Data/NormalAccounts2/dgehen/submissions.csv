&gt; Where are Oliver and Laurel at now, romantically?
&gt; 
&gt; KREISBERG:  It’s Oliver and Laurel.  It’s Lois and Clark.  They can break up, get together, sleep together, break up, get married, get divorced, and she can forget him.  The best part about the success of the show is that it’s always our desire to speed through story.  The fans appreciate that.  We just blow through things.  We’re not like, “Well, we’ll do that in Season 4.”  No, we’ll just do that now.  On the other hand, success has enabled us to slow play some things.  We’ve really adopted this mantra of, “We’ll give people what they need, even if that’s not what they want.”  Having Oliver and Laurel get together in Season 1 is what people needed then.  But then, they needed them to go on a break, so Oliver could have his storyline with Sara for this season.  That’s what felt right to us.  Oliver has women in his life.  He has Laurel.  He has Felicity.  Helena is doing a 10 to 20 stretch.  But Laurel will always be one of the closest people to him, whether that’s romantic or not.  That’s why it’s so powerful to us that, in his darkest hour, Laurel is the one who pulls him out of it.  There has been a subset of fans who have questioned our sanity and our talent, for making some of the decisions we’ve made, over the course of last year and this year, but somebody is always going to be upset.  A lot of the things we have done have been leading up to what we’re doing in the finale, and then moving that forward to Season 3.

Don't just say you're walking away - you need to actually follow through. Ratings are what the people with real power pay attention to, and if everyone that says ""I'm out"" actually tunes out, the suits will take notice. I think most are in agreement that Arrow has been in a decline since Season 2, but the ratings (at least season averages) don't reflect that. In fact, Season 2 is the show's lowest rated season.

Walk away. Close the season with all the final episodes with under 2 million viewers (hasn't happened yet in 4 seasons). They'll take notice.",arrow,[No Spoilers] To everyone vowing to stop watching...,https://www.reddit.com/r/arrow/comments/4drs2d/no_spoilers_to_everyone_vowing_to_stop_watching/

Whether it's Olicity, the fight sequences, or just the show as a whole, many feel that this show is broken and feel it necessary to comment on it here.

I fully empathize, and I've made my opinions known time and again that I don't the show's current direction. However, complaining only here accomplishes nothing. If you're going to complain about the show, complain about it to the people that actually work on the show.

People say that Guggenheim is dismissive of people that don't share his opinion of Felicity, but that's partially because those voices are outliers to the overflowing praise that he and Mericle receive on Tumblr and Twitter. That may be true to an extent. However, the more voices of dissent directly reaching out to them, the better. Individual voices may not have much power, but a fanbase acting collectively can make an impact.

If you're going to attack the show here, at least make the effort to attack it head on as well.

Personally, I'd like a focus on building up the Flash family. Wally is presumably going to start having his powers manifest after taking a bolt of Speed Force energy in #44, and Jay is just wasting away over in an Earth 2 book no one reads. Maybe DC would take the opportunity to do a reimagining of ""The Flash of Two Worlds"" (even in an annual) in order to allow their current Flashes to interact.

Also, let's get some redesigns in here.
