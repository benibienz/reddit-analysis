4,"I'd skip Itaewon unless you're living somewhere else in Korea or Asia and haven't had a taste of western bars for a while. It's not a great representation of Seoul, despite having gentrified in the past few years. The next stop up on line 6 is Hangangjin, and has some great little shops, bars, and restaurants. 

Also, get out of Seoul for a day or two! It's a  long but worthwhile bus ride to Sokcho and then a cheap taxi ride to Seoroksan National Park, which you can manage as a day trip easily (I did it from Suwon, which adds two hours on the metro to Seoul). Seorok is a prime example of beautiful Korea, and there are fantastic pajeon (pancake) restaurants at the base of the mountain, with lots of rice wine (maekkeoli). 

If you have flexibility, go to Hongdae and Sincheon on the weekend, when the markets are out.

The taxes-for-votes argument could be carried to its logical conclusion to suggest that people who have to pay more taxes as a proportion of their income therefore have more valuable votes, and people who aren't expected to pay any taxes should have no vote at all! Those federal and provincial minimums for taxation, then, should be considered when someone turns up at the ballot box.

But Canada claims to be at war with them, which sounds like they're a government, because can you declare war on anything else? (That last is an honest question; I have no idea.)
