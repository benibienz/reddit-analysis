http://www.golfmk6.com/forums/showthread.php?t=93445&amp;page=2

You seem to have a tech background, so I'll go full geek for you. The flash counter is stored in an eeprom (MK5/MK6 R/TT-RS ECUs) or in ""data flash"" emulated eeprom (MK6 GTI/MK7 all). It has nothing to do with the write cycle lifetime on the flash memory (which, even in old ECUs is measured in the thousands). It's there as a security measure and to verify dealer service at dealers that are unable to use the online fault finding/updating system. Those dealers are few and far between in the US, but do exist in the third world, so the mechanism remains.

The flash counter is overwritten every time the car is flashed. Our software (while on the ECU), simply replaces it with the value we tell it to use when the car is flashed back to stock. When you get performance software again, the counter will increment. But, our flashing tool stores your original value and will put that back in when you flash back to stock.

Of the thousands upon thousands of cars we've flashed, there are only a handful of cases where customers have gotten a TD1. Of those, several of the dealers have admitted to manually TD1ing the car because of obvious hardware. (I tell this story every time this conversation comes up, but we've had a VW dealer attempt to TD1 a car for a goapr.com sticker on the window.. I'm NOT kidding). A few of them, we just don't have answers for. The service writer won't admit to doing it and we have no way to prove anything. It sucks, but that's the reality of tuning your car.

In short: As long as your VW dealer aren't complete buttholes looking to manually TD1 you for anything imaginable, as long as you don't have tons of crazy looking hardware attached to the car, and don't spend 1 hour obsessing to the service manager about TD1; the odds of having issues are very low. We can't guarantee that it won't happen, but the percentage of voided warranties is extremely low",2016-09-29 18:28:34+00:00,d878bet,12.0,t1_d877x0x,505.0,GolfGTI

Some songs will distort the mid and highs because the amp won't be enough to drive all frequency's correctly... It will use all its power to drive the bass at the sacrifice of mid and high performance...

Source: I have used my 650s at work from time to time without an amp... I ended up putting a cheap amp/DAC at the office. 

Essentially you don't need an amp but its definitely recommended, almost required. You also don't need a $1000 amp but a $200-500 will be better than a $100 setup like I have at my office...

Also these are not really on the same playing field as the X2s. These are open, need power and have a huge soundstage which is better for some types of music. They also aren't as bassy as closed sets...
