As far as stuff you can do on your own, (I know it can be impossible) but try not to fill so guilty. The key to this for me has been mindfulness. Being able to shut out anxieties about past and future, as well as feelings of failure/guilt/hopelessness, is extremely helpful for overall happiness. There are lots of great books out there that can help- The Mindful Way Through Depression, Resilience by Eric Greitens, and Siddhartha by Herman Hesse were all important for me. Exercise, meditation, acupuncture, yoga are all clinically proven to be helpful, especially when combined with effective therapy and medication.

The other thing is:
&gt;as long as you guys accept that a hell of a lot of you are pretty racist 

My intention in my post was to say that while it is ignorant and wrong, a liberal extrapolating that Trump supporters are hateful based on the extremely hateful minority (as is indicated by the polls I listed) and Trump's offensive statements doesn't mean a liberal is a horrible person. 

I appreciate the rational dialogue you opened, and I will definitely try to look at the ""redneck"" Trumper for lack of a better or less offensive word in a different light. But I think you also need to acknowledge that the hateful people that support Trump and Trump's own statements at least raise some questions.

But that is beside the point, because I didn't say nor do I believe that Trump supporters are ignorant people. I did say that his rise to the top of the GOP was aided by a minority of his supporters who are hateful, which is completely true.

Secondly, you are saying ""I need to stop assuming the worst about people."" My entire post was about how liberals should assume the best about Trump supporters and vice versa. The only person demonizing an entire group is you.

Lastly, I understand that you don't think the right is ignorant, neither do I, (though that would be strange because I consider myself to be on the right) but blanket statements about the left being the real ignorant party aren't helpful either. The left could make the same claims about the right. For example, the left are really the ones who are ignorant about climate change. Really.... Trump said it was a hoax created by the Chinese- whether that's his stance or not, he claims to believe climate change is false despite a scientific consensus. He also is anti vaccine, which is ridiculous. His VP thinks the earth is like 6,000 years old, that we should teach creationism in school, and that we should try to ""convert"" gays to heterosexuality. 

You are demonizing all liberals and getting upset with me for saying some conservatives are hateful and that Trump's words can be interpreted negatively, which are both indisputable statements. I don't understand how I am part of the problem for acknowledging that it is feasible for liberals to make (untrue) negative assumptions based on his statements and a hateful minority of his supporters. I am simply asking that we see the average trump supporter for who they are- someone who wants positive change, and that we see the average liberal for what they are- someone who wants justice and equality for everyone.

64,"&gt;He actually isn't sexist

Honestly not sure if this is a joke....



He thinks women should be ""punished"" for having abortions

He implied Carly Fiorina is too ugly to get votes

“I would never buy Ivana any decent jewels or pictures. Why give her negotiable assets?”

'Former Trump employee Louise Sunshine, who worked from his from 1973-1985, told the Washington Post that the billionaire kept a 'fat picture' of her in his desk drawer, that he would take out when she did something he didn’t like.'

""You know, it doesn't really matter what [they] write as long as you've got a young and beautiful piece of ass.""

""she could only be described as attractive if you like a woman with a bad complexion who is built like a linebacker"".

Trump uttered this charming phrase about women: 'You have to treat 'em like s----'

“but when I come home and dinner's not ready, I go through the roof.”

“I think that putting a wife to work is a very dangerous thing,”

“Unfortunately, after they're a star, the fun is over for me. It's like a creation process. It's almost like creating a building. It's pretty sad.”

My daughter, Ivanka. She's 6 feet tall, she's got the best body.

“If Ivanka weren’t my daughter, perhaps I’d be dating her.”

""I'd look her right in that fat, ugly face of hers""

he sent her a copy of her own article, with her picture circled and ""the face of a dog!"" scrawled across it.

“And I moved on her very heavily... I moved on her like a b----, but I couldn’t get there. And she was married.""

“Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.” “Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.”

 ""So you treat women with respect?"" Trump smiles. ""Ahhhh. I can't say that either,""

“It must be a pretty picture. You dropping to your knee.""

""You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes. Blood coming out of her wherever.""

“I did try and f--- her. She was married.

 Mr Trump called her ""Miss Piggy"" and ""Miss Housekeeping"".",2016-11-08 01:32:03+00:00,d9qfqyc,1,t3_5bnsoe,25882,AskTrumpSupporters
65,"&gt;I would rather not risk a nuclear war

Who is more likely to start a nuclear war, a level headed, intelligent person with decades of foreign experience? Or an immature and easily provoked person who has advocated against supporting NATO allies- which would allow Russia to move into Eastern Europe, the only real scenario for a major war, has advocated for more countries to get nukes, and even advocated the use of nukes. This seems like a no-brainer.

&gt;implement some of the most destructive policies we've ever seen

A moderate, who has been a moderate for decades, and advocates elaborating on moderate policies which have in place for the last eight years, is going to destroy this country? How? 

&gt;Hillary has proven herself to be devoid of basic morality and integrity in private while having differing opinions in public. While I disagree with Trump, at least he's public with his shite opinions.

Is Hillary a scumbag? Yes. But she is not nearly as dishonest as Trump, who has lied about anything and everything. And even though is Hillary is disingenuous, at least she is not publicly proclaiming and promoting extremely immoral and offensive rhetoric that is normalizing hate and setting back our country fifty years. As a social liberal that should concern you.

&gt;Clinton is wily enough to abuse the system

I'm not sure what catastrophic things you think Hillary will do, but Trump has publicly proclaimed his intent to take a steaming dump on the constitution. He wants to end freedom of religion, limit freedom of the press, as well as tear up the fifth and eighth amendments

When it comes down to it, Trump stands for everything you shouldn't stand for as a social liberal. He is a sexual predator at worst and has no respect for women at best. He has promoted racist rhetoric against hispanics, blacks, and muslims. He started the birther movement. He doesn't believe in science. He is an aspiring war criminal, who has pledged to force soldiers to torture and to murder the families of terrorists. 

As a person, he is narcissistic, thin skinned, and volatile, basically a walking joke. He has no integrity. He has been a piece of shit throughout his business career, runs a bogus charity, ran a bogus college, and cheats on his wives. He has has no respect for our military. He said John Mccain is not a war hero, despite the fact that he was TORTURED for years and refused to leave the camp without his men.

70,"I happen to have lots of respect for Trump supporters who want honest political change, but the reality is that many Trump supporters hold deplorable views. According to poll of Trump supporters in the primary (i.e. his core supporters) conducted by pew research:


65% of Trump supporters believe Obama is a Muslim

59% believe Obama wasn’t born in the United States

31% support banning homosexuals from the country

79% said blacks are not an inferior race 

30% wish South had won civil war 


This seems pretty damning; 65% think Obama is a Muslim simply because of the color his skin, which is ignorant at best. 30% are homophobic/racist, and more than 20% are straight up admitted white supremacists

Now I acknowledge these numbers are lower now, as many genuine and good natured Americans have joined on with Trump, and I don't want to diminish that. But among his core, passionate supporters, there is no denying it is full of deplorables. Cue the ""But polls are bullshit because they show something contrary to what I believe"" replies

147,"Good on you for trying to understand and conquer your depression, that's a great first step. A few of these stand out for me. 
A lot of your questions are about the quirks of depression; your feelings are normal and happen to lots of other depressed people.

Meds do help! They are not a panacea, but doctors didn't study for a decade so they could push snake oil. 

Have a developed trust issues? Hell yes. According to my brain my (incredibly loving and supportive and loyal) girlfriend either hates me or is cheating or is about to break with me because she didn't respond to my text five minutes ago.

What have I done? First I waited to long and didn't seek comprehensive treatment- huge mistake. I found a really good psychiatrist and started taking an ssri. Then I found a really good talk therapist. These two steps are huge. When this wasn't enough I checked into an outpatient program. Meditation and yoga and exercise are helpful. Group therapy is scary and weird until you do it- then it is amazingly therapeutic. 
What works for some people doesn't work for others. The key is to find smart doctors and they can tell you what meds and what type of therapies- EMDR, family, etc.  (these things can require money, but regardless of your financial situations there are resources for you) 

Depression is shitty, but if you take steps to conquer it you will return to the happiness and serenity you once felt. Best of luck with all your struggles",2016-10-24 06:09:52+00:00,d95a15z,1,t3_5930xd,929,depression

Next, subtract the aid given to middle income countries, $16 billion. The remainder, $43 billion, is the amount that developing countries received in 2002.

183,"This is a well articulated response, and if I can be convinced it is true, I would be able to CMV, but I have a few reservations.

&gt; Many economists agree that foreign aid doesn't cause economic growth in recipient countries; in fact, a negative correlation is often observed.

This is a position largely championed by Deaton. While economists warn against funding corrupt governments or providing goods that should be produced in the local economy, it is not the position of most economists that there is no effective way to go about giving foreign aid. 

&gt;And if we don't fund the governments directly, it'll be near impossible to actually make a difference

Plenty of NGO's seem to be doing amazing work to prove this wrong. What is wrong with providing mosquito netting or treating those with TB, Malaria, Schistosomiasis, etc?

&gt;the most successful nations are those that are largely self-sufficient.

This is true, but this is not possible in many places. Subsaharan Africa, for example, never developed like Europe because of a lack of domesticated animals and substantive crops, harsh climate and limited natural resources, and a lack of foreign wars to create nationalism and a reason for a strong government to form and levy taxes. These factors are not going away, and I think it is irresponsible to let the problems of poor countries fester and allow their citizens to suffer and die of preventable causes.

It is fair to argue that gun control is ineffective, but to say that people who are worried that innocent Americans are being unnecessarily slain at a rate higher than anywhere in the civilized world are nothing more than dumb and scared is in fact the ignorant position. People with a gun fetish without any regard for the consequences of gun violence are just as narrow minded as liberals who want to take people's guns.

Why spend over 1 trillion on the F-35 with it costs 3,000 to save a human life? Even changing taxes to help the third world would be moral to me.

Their works are brilliant because they reflect the true nature of life and existence. 
&gt;not let it bother them too much

&gt;negative attitude.

I think you misunderstand what causes smart people to be sad. They don't think they are better off being negative; the feelings of depression and existentialism are not a decision that they make or something they want to deal with. These feelings are so profound and ceaseless that cannot be avoided; they pervade every corner of the psyche.

The main error in your view is that happiness is a choice, and you can be happy if you live in a positive and healthy way. This is far from the truth. Read some Sartre, Camus, or Checkhov; these guys were depressed because of their hyperawareness to absurdity, something they could not dismiss. Ignorant people, on the other hand, do not face these profound questions about the nature of life on a daily basis, thus are more carefree.

&gt;develop an opinion on those policies.

1. I once saw this quote on reddit ""You know what the problem is with being an economist? Everyone has an opinion about the economy. No body goes up to a geologist and says, 'Igneous rocks are fucking bullshit.'""
People tend to have opinions on basic economic issues that are not up for debate. For example, Trump and his supporters are against free trade, despite the fact that it has had unanimous support from economists. This is the first reason to learn about economics, understanding important concepts, graphs, and trends will help you weed through what is obviously bullshit in the national discussion.

2. Some stuff is disagreed upon by economists. However, many economists develop their stance due to implicit and confirmation biases. Supply siders are often- not by coincidence- lifelong conservatives who hold conservative values. It is important to have a knowledge of economics in order to determine what the data says rather than what people's opinions are. For example, if you learn that trickle down economics is not based in fact, you can form an opinion on what the marginal tax rate should be based on your values, rather than based on the idea that a lower marginal rate will help the poor. 

3. You talk about being right in regards to foreign policy and economics, which is only the case when something is universally or overwhelmingly beneficial to everyone. For example, you can be right about the Iraq War or Free Trade, but you can't be right about what how much we should tax the rich. Things of that nature must be decided based your economic knowledge combined with your values. ",2016-10-17 00:17:08+00:00,d8v1d0e,1,t3_57tl4k,11756,changemyview

Sexual assaults such as the situation I described are committed by men on college campuses all the time, whom have consciences which could stop them if they understood just how awful their actions were- or if their actions were appropriately stigmatized. However, we live in a society that doesn't condemn those who take advantage of women as the scum of the earth like we should, but instead we often jump to their defense as they could be falsely accused or we vote for them to be president or we blame the woman in some way. 

If you thought you would be admitting to yourself that you are human garbage and ruining you entire life if you were caught, you might think twice before taken advantage of a drunk girl.

248,"You seem to be rejecting the very notion of free trade- which no economist would agree with. With free trade we produce goods that we have a comparative advantage in, thus making us more competitive and innovative. With protectionism, we do jobs that we have no business doing; for example American consumers pay 800,000 dollars for each 50,000 steel job that we save with tariffs. Wouldn't it make far more sense to retrain these workers in an industry that we have a comparative advantage in?",2016-10-07 23:32:43+00:00,d8il0v8,2,t1_d8ikal7,1138,AskTrumpSupporters
249,"Thank you for placating my concerns about Trump's stance on free trade. While I still think he's overzealous, at least what you have stated shows there is a defensible argument for what he is claiming. Now I just need to get over his newest dumpster fire this morning lol ",2016-10-07 23:07:10+00:00,d8ik1ci,4,t1_d8ijufd,301,AskTrumpSupporters
250,"It told me that the yuan has strengthened 35% against the U.S. dollar over the past decade despite claims of massive devaluation and that the nominal exchange rate has no discernible effect on american jobs. And if Chinese goods are cheaper doesn't that help the American consumer? https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/what-you-may-not-know-about-china-and-currency-manipulation/ 
Also what makes NAFTA a shitty deal? Every economist seems to think it was a good deal. What does Trump know that they don't?",2016-10-07 22:46:57+00:00,d8ij8j8,2,t1_d8iie05,1270,AskTrumpSupporters
