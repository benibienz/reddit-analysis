Dragon Fruit:

This seems to be their highest rated flavor. I do not like cream or custard flavors, but I ordered anyway because of the great reviews. And it lived up to the hype. Great dragon fruit flavor ties together perfectly with a light cream. None of that puke tasting custard that I seem to taste with other fruit-cream juices. I would definitely recommend this exotic creamy goodness to anyone ordering from cloudberry

score: 9/10

Strawberry Kiwi:

This taste exactly like every strawberry kiwi flavored drink/candy, so if you like that flavor, you will like this juice. It is a good combo of sweet and tart, with a very crisp and vapeable taste. Nothing special, but a solid fruit flavor that is true to its name.

Score: 7.5/10

Peach-Mango:

I was most excited for this juice as I love stone fruit/ tropical fruit. I was not disappointed. Like their other flavors, this one was very accurate. Mostly peach with a distinct hint of mango on the exhale. Loved this flavor.

Score: 9/10

Pomegranate Berry:

This juice is a deep pink and tastes like it looks. Lots of pomegranate and berry flavor, but surprisingly I never get tired of it. If you like darker berry flavors, you will like this one. Like strawberry kiwi, nothing special but a really well executed and accurate fruit flavor.

score: 8/10

Cereal Crunch:

This crunch berry flavor is amazing. One of the most accurate I have tasted. Good berry flavor, some milk, and a little bit of grain. Not super strong, and perfect for the morning; literally tastes like cereal. My only complaint is that I sometimes get a weird taste from it, but otherwise it is perfect and will be my morning vape for the foreseeable future.

score: 9/10

Thank you to daniel and the cloudberry team for some great juice at a great price!

What I don't get is the love for Mike Pence. The guy seems super ignorant and a total dirtbag.


For all the stuff about Trump being pro-LGBT, Pence seems homophobic as fuck. He is super anti gay marriage. He advocated for diverting taxpayer dollars to so-called conversion therapy. Pray away the gay? holy fuck. While he thought it was okay to spend money on that, he decided he couldn't be bothered to stop an AIDS epidemic on ""moral principle"". Then the notorious religious restoration act, which gave businesses the right to discriminate against gays. The state was losing fuck tons of business just so Pence could push his agenda. Then there is the infamous teaching creationism in schools speech in congress, an issue which most of us got over in 1925. 

Beyond his crazy beliefs, lots of Indianans think he pushed his own agenda instead of actually helping the state. He blew a whole in their deficit, and spent his time on national issues that Indiana didn't care about, which many people think was just to advance his political career. 

I totally respect people's right to believe what they want, which is why I can look past stuff like the ""fetus funeral"" controversy. But where my respect ends is when you use your beliefs to persecute those who are different from you (and in some cases letting them die). Pence's hate and ignorance belongs in a different century, not in the white house in 2016.

I think it's important to understand where they come from.
Trump's rise was, to a large extent, galvanized by the hateful and ignorant. I am not saying that all of Trump's primary supporters are hateful, but it is disingenuous to say that Trump wasn't the candidate for the ignorant. There are plenty of disturbing polls that show this: about two thirds of Trump's core supporters think Obama is a Muslim, one third support banning homosexuals from this country, and one in five admitted to being straight up white supremacists. 

Now, I believe that Trump won because people are sick of the establishment, sick of the same old policies, and want things to be shaken up. But that doesn't take away the racists statements Trump has made, the dozens of misogynistic statements he has made, or the fact that he may well be a sexual predator. I don't see why someone can't understand why a homosexual, muslim, immigrant, victim of sexual assault, woman, or someone that sympathizes with those people are extremely upset about a Trump victory. It is a fair and reasonable interpretation that Trump's statements are not indicative of his character or beliefs, but rather are the result of his non PC and brash nature. While it is fair to interpret Trump as not racist nor sexist, you have to see how it is possible for him to be interpreted that way, and understand that if he is interpreted that way, it should disqualify him from being president.

I just want us to stop putting all liberals in a basket- like many are doing to conservatives- of people who disingenuously cry racism whenever things don't go their way. If you have a strong view on social justice, and you think Trump's statements disqualify him that is a fair opinion. I am not trying to justify any of the inappropriate behavior that liberals have engaged in, or suggest that people should not honor Trump as their president, just that we should meet intolerance with tolerance.

In the debate Trump denied that he has ever called for Japan to have nukes, and called Clinton a liar. Here is the transcript.

Trump:""So, North Korea has nukes. Japan has a problem with that. I mean, they have a big problem with that. Maybe they would in fact be better off if they defend themselves from North Korea.""
Wallace: ""With nukes?"" 
Trump: ""Including with nukes, yes, including with nukes""

What is the deal with all the petty lies? He is constantly lying about even the smallest things; it seems like he can't help it. While this small lies are one thing, I am even more troubled by the big ones, like ""thousands of Muslims cheering as the WTC went down,"" ""There is massive voter fraud,"" ""NAFTA is the worst deal ever signed in history,"" ""Mexico is going to pay for the wall"" ""HRC started the birther movement"" etc. His campaign is based on some of these things which he knows to not be true. 

He is non transparent and won't release his taxes, is a former New York pro abortion liberal who became an evangelical conservative whose favorite verse is 2 corinthians, and he lies about everything from his policies to things that are incredibly trivial.

Trump is a smart guy, so I think if he is coming from the right place he can make positive changes as a true outsider. But if he is just Hillary (with less experience and some major personality flaws) then I can't see voting for him. Why do you Trump supporters see him as genuine? How do you reconcile dishonesty with authenticity? How do you know he really stands for what he claims he does?

22,000 children die each day due to poverty related causes (such as malnutrition, starvation, lack of clean water, malaria, TB, etc). These lives are neither difficult nor expensive to save. The Against Malaria Foundation saves one life for every ~3,000 dollars donated. Our national budget is 3.9 trillion; we spend 29 billion on foreign aid (less than 1%)- which is not even aimed at saving lives, reducing suffering and increasing happiness in the most efficient way.

I am not arguing that countries shouldn't focus on their own citizens; of course we need to make sure Americans are taken care of. But we could things cut things such as eliminating excess military spending, which does not drastically increase happiness or reduce suffering, and we could change the lives of millions of people.  

My view basically comes down to this; suffering, pain, and loss, are just as horrible for people in the third world to experience as Americans. We can either try to slightly improve the lives of Americans who are already well off, or we can end the unimaginable suffering of those in extreme poverty. Help me understand why a world where the average quality of life is higher is worse than one were it is lower. 

If you argue that the money will just be taken by corrupt governments, I would argue that we can focus on NGO's where this is not a problem. With our resources, knowledge, and connections, we certainly could figure out a way to do good things with are money. The other argument that I can think of is that countries need to find a way to lift themselves out of poverty. Political scientists and historians do not see sub saharan Africa as having the resources, institutions, or infrastructure to do this anytime soon. Instead, we can help them establish their economies by helping with things such as education.

I believe that foreign aid is so low because it is not politically convenient and we are not focused on doing what is morally right. Is there another legitimate reason?

Safety seems so important to conservatives, who constantly talk about preventing terrorism on U.S. soil, many even going so far as wanting to ban muslims from entering the country. Despite the effort spent on terrorism, and its financial and civil liberty costs, over a decade there has been 24 deaths from jihadist attacks on U.S. soil compared to over 300,000 during the same time frame (I know this is cherry picking years and terror is a larger threat now, but these are just the years for which I could find accurate numbers, and the trend is the same over any period of time). 300,000 deaths in ten years is absolutely horrific to me. 300,000 people have had their lives cut short and have been taken from their friends and family; add up all of that suffering and you should be mortified. And that is just over ten years. 

To me, that is a tragedy that cannot be dismissed for the sake of preserving a right that has been exalted to a ""sacred"" status for no discernible reason. More than 30,000 people are being killed to preserve something that is merely a symbol of personal freedom. In addition, pro gun americans seem not to understand that their rights are not being threatened. Hardly anyone relevant to the national discussion is advocating the government knocking on your door and confiscating all of your guns. Most simply want people measures like banning those on the terrorist watch list from owning guns, expanding our background checks, or closing loopholes for private sellers.

The arguments opposing gun control seem specious, or don't hold any water at all. 

Argument 1: people have the right to defend themselves. Reality: the risk of losing your life immediately goes up as soon as you own a gun. We are protecting people's right to feel protected, but actually endanger themselves, which doesn't seem worth it.

Argument 2: ""To conquer a nation, you must first disarm its citizens."" Reality: Quoting Hitler is a classic argument, but if you think that we are going to fall victim to an authoritarian government who plans to exterminate its citizens, you probably are a paranoid conspiracy theorist who doesn't understand how this country works. Hint: it's not the same as 1930's Germany. The real danger is already happening, and its coming in the form of 30,000+ deaths a year.

Argument 3: ""Gun control is ineffective.""-people who live in the only developed nation with astronomical numbers of gun deaths. Reality: It is fair to oppose somewhat misguided measures such as trying to prevent mass shootings (which don't actually kill that many people) by banning large capacity magazines. However, gun advocates don't just oppose these measures but ALL measures, and refuse to offer any alternative legislation that would save lives and preserve their rights.

Argument 4: Slippery slope, we can't start relinquishing our gun rights or we will lose more. Reality: This is a classic fallacy used against any measure that tries to help people, such as gay marriage. Gay marriage has been legal for a while but its still illegal for a man to marry a donkey. I just don't see how it makes sense to oppose reasonable legislation because it will lead to unreasonable legislation.

Argument 5: None of these arguments matter, regardless of what you think, the 2nd amendment guarantees my right to own guns anyway. Reality: I also am a fan of the right to ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."" People have the right not to get murdered in the street, and that seems more sacred than your right to form a well regulated militia to defend yourself when Obama imposes sharia and marshal law before leaving office. Which by the way, you still have the right to do because no one wants to take your guns away. 


In summary, I think that gun advocates are letting many people die to preserve their oddly sacred right to own a gun, which really isn't even being threatened. I think I might come across as snarky or arrogant in the argument i just wrote, but I know there are a lot of people a hell of a lot smarter than me who are pro gun, and I don't for a second think with certainty that I know better than they do. I simply want to open my eyes to the other side of an issue that I see as indefensible.

edit: many people think I am saying liberals are entirely correct on guns; I do not think that. Some liberals overemphasize mass shootings, demonize gun owners, have zero respect for 2nd amendment, or focus on passing legislation without considering its effectiveness.

However, when I kept hearing Mr. Trump say things like ""NAFTA has destroyed our country"" I figured I was missing something and I took a closer look. Quote: http://1wnc.com/economics/776289.html

What I found was every president since WWII has been a vocal supporter of free trade. Almost every respected economist supports free trade. When a large group of top economists was asked this question: ""Freer trade improves productive efficiency and offers consumers better choices, and in the long run these gains are much larger than any effects on employment."" None disagreed. When asked: ""On average, citizens of the U.S. have been better off with the North American Free Trade Agreement than they would have been if the trade rules for the U.S., Canada and Mexico prior to NAFTA had remained in place."" None disagreed. http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_0dfr9yjnDcLh17m

The more I read, the more it seems like every top economist is an ardent supporter of free trade. In addition, in economics, trade deficits are natural and not necessarily a bad thing; we are not losing 58 billion dollars a year to Mexico as Mr Trump claims, that simply means we are importing their goods. One of his other points, China's currency manipulation- ""We can't continue to allow China to rape our country, and that's what they're doing""- is largely overstated according to most economists. Here is two of many sources http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2016/06/13/as-donald-trump-says-china-is-a-currency-manipulator-just-upwards-not-down/#4eb61f497352 http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2016/09/15/donald-trump-is-a-few-years-behind-on-the-china-currency-problem/

NAFTA was not a job killer, helped our economy, and was not the ""worst deal ever"" according to economists. His points about China and trade deficits don't seem to make a lot of economic sense as well. I have heard the counter argument that Trump doesn't hate free trade, he just wants better trade deals. But this doesn't seem to be the case due to his hatred of NAFTA and proposals such as introducing high tariffs or starting a trade war with China.

I don't want to support Hillary but I am starting the think that Trump is either wrong or being dishonest about this issue to fuel pro manufacturing and America first sentiment. Are Trump's mercantilist ideas a disingenuous attempt to appeal to the middle class? What am I missing?
