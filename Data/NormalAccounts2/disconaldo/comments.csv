3,"Happy to!

Diet (at first)
Breakfast: Nothing
Lunch: Sunbutter on a whole wheat tortilla (260 cal); Oikos Greek yogurt (120 cal); Bachman pretzel sticks (100 cal)
Dinner: Campbell's healthy choice soup (~280 cal) and maybe another sunbutter tortilla and a snack.
I tracked everything in MFP and tried to stay at a 500 cal deficit.
Now, I'm adding Costco egg whites for breakfast (250 cal) and grilled chicken to my sunbutter tortilla (90 cal) and a Costco protein bar (190 cal) for lunch.  I might add another protein bar for dinner, too.
Exercise was 60 minutes on the elliptical every day.  Now I do StrongLifts 5x5 three days a week and the elliptical on the off days.
