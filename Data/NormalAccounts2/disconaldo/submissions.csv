I can't do anything but try to hit ESC a bunch of times and, if I'm lucky, I get thrown back out to the desktop, which ALWAYS has rotated 90 or 180 degrees.  I've tried Googling this, but I can't make heads or tails of what people are saying.  I don't know how to access a ""BIOS,"" and I don't know what ""over/under clocking"" means.

Do I need more RAM?  I can't imagine that's the case... but that's about the only thing I can do with this Inspiron, apparently.  Did I just buy the wrong computer?  Should I have splurged a bit more?
