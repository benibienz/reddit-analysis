0,I think you can register for a chance to buy world series tickets until the 16th. I was under the assumption that if you don't win NLDS tickets that you are automatically entered to win- ahem- for the opportunity to buy NLCS tickets. I was lucky enough to be at game 3 at Wrigley- hands down the best ballgame I've ever seen.,2015-10-14 02:56:22+00:00,cvyztmk,3,t1_cvyz5fh,1006,CHICubs
1,"I got 4 tickets in section 303 Budweiser Bleachers. When I view the seating chart, the rows only go up to 11 and I have seats in row 14. Any idea on what that's about?",2015-09-29 01:25:48+00:00,cvhlbse,3,t1_cvgzrfb,33310,CHICubs
2,I opted for 4 seats together at first home game for NLDS. My nearly panicked at the sight having the choice to choose tickets and didn't want to waste time. I chose left field bleachers. How was it for you?,2015-09-29 01:23:44+00:00,cvhl90q,1,t3_3mpf55,37866,CHICubs
3,"Under PSLF, can one submit working for non-profits before 2006, when, I believe, the program started? I think it wasn't made to be retroactive. ",2015-09-16 16:19:46+00:00,cv3ma7c,1,t3_3l488w,53278,socialwork
4,"I have just sent in my paperwork for this forgiveness program. I only wonder this: because I consolidated my undergrad and graduate loans, will they be able to forgive some or any portion of the consolidated loan? It is my understanding that they will only forgive federal loans and how would they be able to know what monies are from a federal loan vs. Iowa Student Loan that are now lumped into one monthly payment? 

Anyone else wondering or have experience with this?

5,"One respected leader I knew in my first job out of college said he ""went to prison in the 70's"" (I assume it was drug related/sales/trafficking). Several years later I met a woman who had spent 4 years in a federal prison for a bank robbery (semi-drug related).",2015-09-12 01:10:45+00:00,cuykbvz,2,t1_cuyhoc0,5433,socialwork
6,Both of the people I mentioned above served time in prison. One was of high importance in the agency. It's good to know that change can take place - even better to know that these people were accepted and allowed to work as professionals.,2015-09-11 17:32:30+00:00,cuy4lm4,2,t1_cuy46fi,632,socialwork
7,"There is a caveat that I know of. In 2004 I applied for my licensure in my state for social work and the state regulatory body for social workers (the Board of Professional Regulation) sent me a letter stating that they had a mental health diagnosis of mine. I won't get into details but there is a bit more to this. About 21 years ago (in 1994) I was arrested (as an 18 year old) and this was also listed in the letter that basically stated that they were calling me for an informal hearing regarding my licensure application. I expected that the state may want to ask me about my criminal record but wasn't expecting that they would have a mental health diagnosis of mine. When I asked about it they wouldn't say where they got it from. Since that time, I had done research and apparently health regulatory bodies that grant licensure may have access to mental health records. I signed no releases or disclosed anything on my application. The story has a happy ending. I have been practicing as a licensed clinical social worker for about 10 years and even now, as a mental health professional, I am wary when documenting, diagnosing and generally anything having to do with ethics.",2015-09-11 02:25:59+00:00,cuxhpqm,1,t3_3kc5hn,86913,psychotherapy

13,It's not bad. You may be under a lot of stress or feeling anxious or overwhelmed. Crying is part of being a human being. Reflect on it and consider bringing I up to your supervisor next meeting. It's all part of the process. ,2015-08-29 04:15:43+00:00,cujfumi,1,t3_3inarx,111851,psychotherapy
