I've never been abroad (unless you count a trip to Canada when I was in diapers).

I learned that I ""may want to apply"" for a visa is I have a criminal record. I'm tentatively planning on applying for a visa soon (our trip is in June) to be on the safe-side.

My convictions (Harassment and Possession of Stolen Property)are over 20 years old and occurred when I was 18. I am now 40 years old. I never received prison time. Something tells me that I'll be let through to visit the country for 2 weeks without a visa but the uncertainty is enough to make me post and ask any of you who are reading this if you've had a similar experience. 

Thanks!

I myself have one and have met 2 others in my 15 years as a professional (10 of which now spent as an LCSW).

I hope this is okay to post. I'm not asking anyone to disclose anything personal- just general knowledge. I've always been curious- especially about other people's experiences with the state licensure process...but then again, that may be drifting into personal territory. 

Incidentally, the other two professionals I knew were not licensed social workers. Both were CADC counselors. ",socialwork,Professionals with Criminal Records,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/3kkd6o/professionals_with_criminal_records/

I currently work in the field of community mental health and have been reading the news on this rather carefully. Of course, the community mental health organizations are against the idea, saying that it would ""drive up cost"" and make the competition for providers (particularly psychiatrists) even more fierce. On the other hand, my community seemingly always has to transport patients to larger nearby cities (nearby being a relative term).
