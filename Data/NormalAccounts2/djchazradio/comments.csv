Here's an [interesting article](http://www.nick-rider.com/blog/palmar-de-troya/).

An excerpt: 

&gt;Even so, the former Pope still says ‘there’s nothing bad’ hidden inside El Palmar, and makes a joke of the idea that they are financed by the mafia or have a stash of weapons. He denies that they ever wished to make a saint of Hitler but defends their continuing reverence for Franco, declaring that he himself is still a Francoist.

When I was living in the south, I met a lot of really good people. I met southern men and women who believed in a better world and an interesting future. 

However, I met a lot more Southerners who were addicted to Oxycotin and terrible fried chicken. I didn't like mainstream Southern culture. You guys say you're ""friendly."" Yeah, I'm from the goddamn Pacific Northwest, and we are actually fucking friendly up here. Just because you guys are not as jerky and conceited as some asshole from Boston doesn't mean you're the friendliest place in America.

That's a weird, unrelated fact to tag onto the end of the story. And the fact that it's not given any context makes it not only irrelevant but misleading. 

Does it mean there are a lot of drunk drivers in the capital? Well apparently the Washington, D.C. area has about 50 drunk driving arrests a day. So does it mean there are more drinkers in Moscow than in Washington? 

Let's compare the populations. Moscow has a population of 12 million, and the DC area has a population of 6 million, so if you adjust the figures for population, Washington, D.C. has essentially the same drunk-driving arrest rate as Moscow.

But was the TASS story talking about the drunk driving arrests in Moscow within the city limits, or about the metropolitan area of Moscow. Because if that's the case, the Russia actually has fewer drunk driving arrests proportionately than Washington, D.C. 

But we don't know. The story doesn't tell us. It just tags that orphaned piece of information at the end of the story. But why?!

And also, look at that record. I've met people who have had crimes like these on their records. Let me tell you what these crimes meant to real people: 

* Burglary - This guy was 19 years old, and with a group of like-minded youths snuck into a warehouse in an industrial area that contained nitrous oxide tanks. Ya know, to get high. Well a couple other kids got the tank and ran one way. He was with them and ran another. He was the one who was caught. Charged. 

* Possession of stolen car: This kid stole a car when he was in his early twenties. He was a dumbass and was pulled over. Charged. 

* Domestic assault - A friend got in a scuffle with his *extremely* drunk wife and knocked her into a wall. Charged. 

Yeah, then he threatened the officers and tears the shit out of his girlfriend's house. He's nuts. I've had relatives and friends go off their rockers once in a while. They need support. This guy didn't have *any* support. And that's really sad. And that's why he crazied himself into a forty year sentence. 

I'd just be careful to too casually throw out extremely harsh sentences to people who get themselves caught up with the law. Had this guy had a family and support, he'd be better. Instead, he's going into a living hell for four decades.

170,"This is the most absurd ""statistic"" I've heard in a while. 

Okay according to Bloomberg's statistics and this headline, there are 31 civil servants for every thousand people in China while the good ol' USA has an astounding 75 civil servants for China's 31. 

Gee whiz *thanks* Obama. We sure are overly bureaucratic in the United States. 

But wait a minute. China has an *enormous* population. What are the raw numbers?

Well, do the math and extrapolate the above figures and you'll see that while America has 2.4 million civil servants, China has **43 million civil servants.** 

Now also consider that nearly ***half*** of American civil servants are police officers. That's right. And China has approximately 1.6 police officers in their number of civil servants. America has far more police officers per capita than China, it's true. 

But the article is not about policing, it's about bureaucrats in general. And it's trying to say that the United States has more bureaucrats per capita than communist, state-driven China. 

But remove law enforcement from the equation, you'll see that the United States has a bit over a million civil servants while China has about **41 million** similarly placed bureaucrats. 

This headline could have read: **CHINA HAS *41 TIMES* THE NUMBER OF BUREAUCRATS AS THE UNITED STATES WHILE ONLY HAVING FOUR TIMES THE POPULATION.**

Bloomberg is just sneakily pushing some anti-government pro-corporate bullshit. To hell with them. 

And don't get me started about how the various American governments (state, local, federal, tribal etc) offer far superior service to the general public than Chinese governments offer to their citizens. Yeah, the DMV can be frustrating, but you're not having your place in line bumped by someone who paid a bribe. Trust me, that ain't happening as much over here.

Okay let's pitch this thing: 

&gt; The first scene of the movie will be a sweeping helicopter show of pristine, blue water from high above. A small light-colored spot comes into view, and a zoom shows it's a small boat. It's the same boat Andy was working on from the first movie. 

&gt; Cut to a shot from inside the boat. Andy and Red are sailing their boat, swaying because of small waves with content looks on their faces. 

&gt; Morgan Freeman voice over: Ol' Andy Dufresne and I were glad to be out of prison. But at the same time, prison made us the people we are. And it made something much more: A friendship.

&gt; Andy: I heard the hardest screw to every walk Shawshank -- the prison we both spent years at - was just released from prison. 

&gt; Red: That's what I heard. Oh Captain Hadley got fired from the police force, and according to my contacts works as a dope smuggler running grass from Mexico up to the States. 

&gt; Speed boat comes into view. A close up shows it's Byron Hadley, smuggling marijuana. He looks over and sees Andy and Red, and pulls his boat along side them.

&gt; Hadley has a scar and has long hair. 

&gt; Hadley: Well looky here. Andy and Red. You boys were as thick as thieves back at Shawshank.

&gt; Red: How was *your* time on the inside, Byron. 

&gt; Hadley: Screw you. You're still just a couple of cons. But you know, my, uh, *operation* needs some bookkeeping. Dufresne, you're just the wife-killing banker I need. 

&gt; Andy: I won't do it. 

&gt; Hadley: You will or I'll have you both deported out of here so quickly and back in American prison for the rest of your lives! I still got contacts. 

Andy Dufresne works for Hadley unwillingly, but falls in love with a beautiful Mexican girl, who he can't pursue because it would endanger her life. 

Turns out this time, it will be Red who outmarts Hadley, freeing his friend so that he can pursue the love of his life. Second to last scene will be Andy getting married, and hey, it rains on his outdoor wedding just like it was raining when he escaped prison. 

The very last scene shows Red with a wry smile as he races along the beach in Hadley's speed boat. Yep, he outsmarted Hadley and became the head of a Mexican smuggling gang. This time it was Red who did all the outsmarting!

&gt; Bust shot of Red smiling and laughing as he drives his newly acquired boat into the pristine, blue waters of Mexico.

221,"I've hitchhiked a bit in the US, Canada and Mexico, and I can give you some tips. 

* Wear nice clothes. I wore button-up shirts and had people remark that they wouldn't have picked me up until they saw my shirt. 

* Always choose a place to hitchhike that has a wide and safe area for a car to pull over a hundred feet or so down the road. If there's a wide spot right by where you are hitchhiking, walk away from it.  Hardly any cars are going to see you and immediately stop. There's always a decision process they make. Let them make it. 

* Keep a relaxed smile on your face while you have your thumb out. Hitchhiking can be hard, but don't let it show. 

* Keep your luggage obscured behind you, and if you have multiple pieces, line them up behind you from largest to smallest. This gives them the smallest visual profile and increases your chance of a pickup. 

* Use the offramps in a metropolitan area nearest the direction you want to travel. For instance, I was in Lincoln Nebraska and was headed west. Well I was dropped off on the east side of town. Fun walk that was. 

* If you're female, carry pepper spray and a knife, and the *instant* you feel uncomfortable in a car ask to get out, and be aggressive. You will be hit on constantly by creeps. Men, you will also be hit on, except they will be middle-aged married men looking for a thrill. Dont worry about them. They're harmless. It wouldn't hurt to have pepper spray and a knife if you're a less intimidating fellow. I'm 6'1"" 220 pounds and never had to worry about a thing. 

* You'll notice a lot of hostile and heartless architecture as a hitchhiker. However, you should always be keeping an eye out for a place to rest or camp when the sun starts getting low. Don't be afraid to walk. 

* Police will hassle you. Don't be carrying anything illegal.

* Never get separated from your gear. If they won't let you bring your luggage into the cab of a vehicle, decline the ride. Except for guys driving open-bed pickups. 

* When encountering another hitchhiker in the same ramp, they either have to wait or hitchhike a 100 feet further up the road. 

That's all I can think of for now. Good luck! ",2016-07-07 16:23:53+00:00,d52z2zl,1.0,t3_4rp9k1,1976,AskReddit

I always felt that there would have to be intent that is subverted in order for there to be irony. It wasn't the intent of the rocket NASA launched to avoid lightning. The intent was to improve our understanding of lightning. No actual intent wasn't subverted.

Now I think irony would be if the rocket that NASA sent to study lightning in fact collected bad data and actually  **decreased** our understanding of lightning. That would be true irony (in my opinion) because the direct intent was subverted. 

If the reason that the rocket failed and reduced our understanding of lightning was because it was struck by lightning, then that would make that irony very tasty, but itself would not be ironic.

* I'm going down San Francisco to pick up a welfare check (this guy was in Minnesota

* I'm headed to a Phish concert.

* Former pimp who talked about making $2,000 **a day.**

* Vietnam vet who saw a lot of combat and was willing to talk about it a bit. 

* Former drug smuggler who used to run marijuana and cocaine between the Caribbean and Florida. 

* Crazy southern belle who was driving with a Bud Light Ice between her legs, was drunk as hell, and had deep cuff marks on her wrists from her very recent fight with the local police at a bar. She was incredible, and wasn't worried about getting nude. 

* Insane Polish guy who was driving his French RV to Miami to ship it to France to drive it to Poland to have it detailed.

It would start with the banks erasing all the world's financial data.  Bill Clinton was going to unconstitutionally extend his presidency to a third term which would result in mass impoverishment under a multi-cultural-enforcing soft fascist government. Large sections of rural America were going to necessarily revolt, so 2nd Amendment private militias sprung up. 

Middle-aged men were engaged in military ""training"" in the woods while smoking Marlboro cigarettes. It was obvious that the United States was going to be subsumed into a global supernation under the auspices of the United Nations. 

Ultimately, as we all remember, the United Nations was actually a front for the Devil, and he and the other Fallen Angels of Hell would make an attack on the righteous people of the world and would rule the Earth until the return of Jesus as foretold in the Book of Revelation.

342,"No, his ideas don't make me uncomfortable. They're just silly. 

For instance, a mental disorder that's recently got some play on Reddit is *capgras syndrome,* or the idea that someone you know is being replaced with an impostor. 

What does Freud say causes this? Obviously, it's because the sufferer is sexually attracted to his mother, and the sufferer will blank out recognizing his mother because they can't reconcile that with their sexual attraction to the face. So they say ""that's not my mother."" 

Problem is, people suffer this when looking at *anybody* in the family. People will believe family dog has been replaced by a similar dog, and it's not because they want to have sex with their dog. 

Modern science has shown us that injuries to the brain that connect your visual neurons with some emotional neurons seem to be the cause behind this. 

Freud just made nonsense up. He's just muddying the waters with his self-important dreck. It's totally irrelevant to modern psychiatry and modern thinking. Problem was, it was irrelevant when it was conceived. The secret desire to have sex with your mother was *never* the cause of capgras syndrome, and I can't imagine *any* circumstance where that incorrect theory would have therapeutic value whatsoever. 

At least a witch doctor listens to a patient and talks to them. There is actually therapeutic value to listening to somebody and then performing some sort of ""healing"" due to the placebo effect. 

Freud scores less than a witch doctor with a bone in his nose on the ability to treat patients. His ideas were a huge waste of time and printed paper.

383,"&gt; To summarize, if “FGM” is wrong because it “destroys sexual pleasure” – then forms of “FGM” that do not destroy sexual pleasure must (on this logic) be considered permissible

&gt; But if “FGM” is wrong because it involves cutting into the genitals of a vulnerable child, . . . and (in some cases) removing a healthy part of her body that she might later wish she could have experienced intact, then male circumcision is equally wrong on those grounds. 

No. No it isn't. He's forgetting that the foreskin is VASTLY different than parts of the body affect by female genital mutilation. 

Yes I understand the academic arguments about how these things are morally similar. Yeah, I get it. And there are sound health reasons behind the idea that a Mohel shouldn't do a traditional Jewish circumcision. 

But the problem isn't western crybaby males complaining that they don't have a foreskin through a safe and sanitary procedure that happened as baby in the hospital. The problem is girls in Uganda who have large portions of their external genitalia **removed** with a used barber's knife. 

[That's REALLY FUCKED UP.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn_pKycgb38)

615,"You live in a scary, weird world. One in which a major political party intentionally funnels foreign criminals into their home country in order to maintain power given to them by a native, ethnic minority. This ethnic minority is in league with foreign nationals and criminals to subvert our homeland's sovereignty and turn what is now a superpower into a weak banana republic, subservient to the world around it. 

This national suicide is being perpetrated by folk who simply dislike the United States and the democratic principles for which it stands, as well as in revenge for American success in the 20th century. Probably because of jealousy as well. 

I know what you're thinking. You're thinking ""hell yeah that's exactly how I feel. That's the way *it is!*

People accuse conservative media of brainwashing the masses. Nah. Media companies have one bottom line: Profit. We're working in the free market people! People wanted to hear that stuff. 

They really liked having their world view reinforced. Loved it.  It's a worldview that among other things contains the idea that there is a shrinking group of mostly white traditionalists who value freedom and rightness, who are currently beleaguered but still hopeful and eager to regain former days of glory.

Then I realized I still had the spins so I walked back to the garage and told them ""I still need the fucking fan"" and walked right next to them, picked up the fan and walked out. As I walked out the door I told them to ""have fun."" 

Then I went back to bed and pointed the fan right at my head so fight those damn liquor spins. ",2016-04-08 01:42:27+00:00,d1udy4x,1.0,t3_4du88w,1202,AskReddit

English culture has a panoply of names available. Muslim culture does as well, but very *very* often they put the name Mohammed somewhere in the name.

That means out of 90 English kids, you'll have mostly unique names. Some duplicates of course. Out of 10 Muslims, 3 or 4 might have Mohammed in their name. Therefore, ""Mohammed"" is the ""most popular"" name for children in London, even though 90% of the people wouldn't even consider that name for their children.

911,"I ran a small pizza joint that rented the property it was located at. I could not make this thing turn a profit, especially considering how high the rent was. It made no sense. The previous owner of the pizza joint said the place made enough to pay the rent and make a profit. It made no sense a all why we were struggling so badly. 

Well I found evidence that the previous owner had inflated his books, and I realized he was conspiring with the landlord to move back into the place once we had failed. We--as owners--were nothing more than a cash infusion for them, designed to fail. 

I was livid. In our contract with the previous owner, it stated that we had purchased all the kitchen accoutrements in the building. So one day after we ran out of pizza dough, we immediately started demolition. We took out the walk-in fridge. The sinks. The vent hood. The pizza oven. EVERYTHING. 

Now I happened to know that if the vent hood was removed from this building, due to some odd city rules it would not be able to legally operate as a restaurant any longer. I also knew that if the sign was removed, it could not be legally re-installed. 

The next day while I was still working on the removal of the equipment. And in the first time in a year, the owner of the real estate company tore up to the building, his face contorted with anger and confusion. 

Now I had been pleading with this guy's company for months, and he never responded or gave me a break in any way. I was nothing but a chump to him. 

Now he was looking at his plan of continuing the restaurant after a cash-infusion from said chumps going down the drain. 

He didn't even introduce himself. He merely yelled out his window ""you can't take the oven hood!"" I shrugged and told him we bought it. He grimaced in disbelief, then looked at the grandfathered sign and yelled ""you can't take that sign!""

I nodded. Indeed we had not purchase the sign. He pulled away abruptly in his Caddie and punched it down the road. Satisfying conversation. And indeed the pizza joint never returned to that location. I got $7,000 for the equipment I sold off. We paid almost $200,000 for the business.

1118,"First of all, the cause of death would immediately be ascertained by the surviving crew. This is crucial because the astronauts' health is monitored before they take off and while in orbit, so a death would be under rare medical circumstances, or worse there could still be a threats to the crew's safety while they are in orbit. The body of the lost astronaut would be stored in the crewmen's sleeping bag and secured for the return to the surface in the next supply mission. Investigators on the ground would then perform an autopsy. 

If the crew determines that there is still a safety issue on board the ship, the nature of the threat must be determined. Potential safety issues could include: electrical shortages in the crew compartment; improper circulation or scrubbing of the air; loose gear or storage devices intruding into the area where astronauts move in free fall; or biological contamination. 

All the above mentioned problems listed above (except for biological contamination) have a similar protocol built around *assessing* and then *reacting.* After the crew has reacted they assess the threat again, and if they need to, *react* again and so on. This protocol loop is only broken when the threat is gone or the crew has successfully abandoned the craft. 

The biological contamination threat is treated differentoh. It has concerned researchers since even before manned space flight. Especially the idea of being infected by something that you wouldn't be exposed to on Earth. 

The protocols for biological contamination protocols are built around the concepts of *assess* and *contain.*

Notice that *contain* is NOT *decontaminate.* It is in fact the highest priority that the biological contaminant have a specimen brought back to Earth. Getting a biological sample is well within the training on any ISS mission. If the biological agent is multicellular, it is up to the crew to determine how to capture it for transport back to the Earth. 

What is known is that NASA has confidential protocols which state that in cases of biological contamination, the crew is expendable in the chance that the biological contaminant can be weaponized.

1235,"One of my first jobs in radio 10 years ago was working as a call screener for a talk radio host who at the time averaged around being the 3rd to 5th most listened-to talk show host in the United States.  I hope you don't mind a long post, because I have nothing to do on a Friday night. 

**- BACKGROUND -**

A call screener talks to people who call the show to determine whether or not they would be good on the air. The call screening on this show was exceptionally rigorous, and there's no doubt in my mind that it was the tightest call-screening on a national political talk show. Even better than Rush Limbaugh's call screening. 

On this show, it was not outrageous to talk to over 150 people in the **first hour** of the show to to load up the phone lines with a good mix of different callers.  

Talk radio had a boom in the 90s, much of it driven by conservative talk show hosts led by Rush Limbaugh, but there was also a lot of other successful regional and national shows of all stripes. 

In 2004 however, there was the notorious Janet Jackson ""wardrobe malfunction."" Ask anyone who worked in broadcasting (either radio OR TV) and they will shudder just thinking about it. There was an intense public backlash against broadcasters that hit talk radio ***hard***. After the clamor died down, much of the remaining talk show landscape remained in the hands of conservative hosts. 

And the host I worked for was notoriously considered one of the *most* conservative of the bunch. 

**- TALK RADIO CALLERS -**

Before I describe the people who call conservative talk radio shows, I want to make clear that I am not picking on anybody. I'm speaking from a breadth of experience working in the business. 

A majority of people who call into a conservative talk show hosts share one, some or all of the following descriptors:

* Angry

* Low information

* Religious

* Rural or Southern (not picking on you guys, but you're generally death to radio)

* Gun nut

* Racist

* Parroting of established talking points (AKA uninsightful/boring)

* Prone to conspiracy theories

* Flat-out loony

You have to pick through those people in order to get to what you need. Sometimes you need someone who's on-topic and can amplify the hosts point. Sometimes you need someone who's off-topic and can help the host pivot to some other issue. 

For the most part, though, a call screener just needs someone who sounds interesting on the air. 

**- THE MISTAKE HOSTS MAKE -**

I have worked with no less than 40 talk show hosts during my time in radio. Broadcasters and producers with national experience know for a fact that a tiny minority of your listening audience will ever call into a radio show. Indeed, industry research says that it's something like 2% of any audience that will ever take the time to call into a radio program to voice their opinion. 

Inexperienced hosts sometimes got it into their heads that if a topic they were discussing was getting a lot of callers, then it meant the topic was *hot.* 

Problem is, you could fill an entire hour of radio time by simply doing this: 

&gt; ""What do you prefer? Cats or dogs. Call now! Caller, you're on the air!""

&gt; ""I prefer dogs."" 

&gt; ""A dog person huh? Well this other caller from Cincinatti doesn't agree with you. Caller, *you're* on the air!""

&gt; ""I like cats."" 

At this point in a radio show, the phones lines will be **packed to the gills,** while most of your audience would have turned to a different show. The number of callers was not an accurate representation of the number of *listeners.*

Advertisers don't care how many people want to get in on the conversation. They want people to listen to their commercials. The attitude among all radio producers was basically: 'To hell with callers. They mean *nothing.*'

**- WHAT A GOOD PRODUCER DOES -**

A talk radio producer learns to hate callers. If talk radio is the armpit of show business (which it is), then callers are the asshole of that armpit. Sometimes talk show hosts are lured by what they perceive as ""attention"" when a huge flux of callers comes in on a topic. And sometimes they'll want to stay on that topic in order to keep generating more incoming calls. 

You just have to ask the host: Who's in charge of this show? Us? Or some fucking idiot from Cincinatti? **It's US goddammit!**

**TL:DR CALLERS ARE A TERRIBLE INDICATION OF HOW GOOD YOUR SHOW IS**",2016-02-20 03:19:49+00:00,d06omgn,3.0,t1_d06n1ez,3099,todayilearned

I live in a rural agricultural area that 20 years ago was white as the driven snow and distrustful of Hispanic immigrants. However, it being a farming community, there were a **ton** of immigrants. Hell, when I was in Sonora, Mexico I met a guy in a bar who knew my small hometown like the back of his hand because he had spent so many summers up there working. 

A LOT of immigrants didn't just come for work and leave. They stayed and they had children.

Now that all the immigrants' children have grown up, we have a large second-generation population of Hispanics. They have started businesses, gotten jobs, and have become an integral part of the community. 

Hell there was Mexican music playing in the local bar, which would have started a drunken white riot if it happened 20 years ago. 

In the communities of the Pacific Northwest where Hispanics have settled and have children, the economy has done well and the path that Mexican immigrants are taking looks almost identical to that of the Italians and Irish of the northeast. The first generation struggles. The second generation works. And soon, this third generation of Mexicans will be 100% Americanized brats! :)

The NRA's gun politics mirror the politics of white racist America. When it was a concern that minorities have firearms, they were in favor of restrictions.

Now, they are in favor of loose gun restrictions but heavy policing of minority areas. Turn minorities into felons and you don't have to worry about them legally carrying guns.

Ronald Reagan perfectly exemplifies this. When he was governor of California, he was in favor of gun restrictions. When he became president he was in favor of looser gun restrictions and heavy minority policing.

The NRA is nothing but a lobbying group for gun manufacturers and conservatives.

His Realpoliticks made him support fascists in South America and Southeast Asia, and he justified his support of these players through a game of semantics. 

American-supported regimes were defined by Kissinger as being ""authoritarian."" Kissinger said that Second World (Soviet)-supported regimes were ""totalitarian."" He suggested that the difference was in how the regimes would develop. 

Authoritarian regimes, he said, would be--although harsh--stable and capable enough to transform into democracies. Totalitarian regimes on the other hand would be stuck in an illiberal stasis and would never turn into a democracy.

Could they be similarly ignorant of Reddit inside jokes? Yes. No one's arguing that.
As someone who has been on Reddit for 7 years, I am telling you, specifically, in Reddit, no one compares ""New Redditors"" with ""Non Redditors."" If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.
If you're saying ""Non Redditors"" you're referring to the almost 7 billion people who do not use Reddit, which includes people like 9Gagers, 4 Channers and even people who do not use the internet. 
So your reasoning for comparing a New Redditor a Non-Redditor is because random people ""think newbies don't get it?"" Let's get Facebookers and Instagrammers in there, then, too.
Also, calling someone a YouTube commenter or a Stormfront member? It's not one or the other, that's not how it works. They're both. A New Redditor is a New Redditor and formerly a Non-Redditor. But that's not what you said. You said a New Redditor is like a Non-Redditor, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the human race Non-Redditors, which means you'd call Liveleakers, Imgurians, and other Internet Users ""Non-Redditors"", too.

Because of this, ALL marriages are handled directly by the federal government, who wield the power to also collect fingerprints and perform background checks on every single person getting married. The institution of marriage completely collapses from its current state to becoming a reproduction license with the state, riddled with corruption.

My American friend and I just smirked and shrugged because what constituted an ""international"" classroom was hilariously low.

As someone who was raised on a ranch, I am telling you, specifically, in animal husbandry, no one calls ranches ""fences."" You shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.


If you're saying ""ranch"" you're referring to the entire structure and all the accoutrements necessary to live on the land and raise animals, including the corrals, the pastures and even the ranch house where the owner lives. 


So your reasoning for calling a ranch a thing that holds cows in because random people ""call ranches fences?"" Let's call corrals and hay feeders ranches then too!


Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how it works. They're both. A fence is a fence and is part of what makes up a ranch. But that's not what you said. You said a ranch holds cows in, which is not true.

Then they compared that to ""rape"" outside of prison, which now [includes having sex while drunk.](http://www.justice.gov/opa/blog/updated-definition-rape). 

So if a man had consexual sex with a prison guard, he's considered a ""rape victim"" in the prison statistic. You can't compare consexual sex inside prison with a rape of a woman on the street. Those acts don't even compare!

Also, just check out the DOJ rape statistics that the Mail piece quotes. [Here they are](http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cvus0801.pdf). 

Sexual assaults *outside* prison are 80,000 ***per year*** for women. What is it for men? About 1,600. That's **50 TIMES** the rate that women get sexually assaulted versus men. 

Now when you include all sexual assaults and rape (which by definition now includes merely being intoxicated) the rate equalizes a bit to 164,000 total assaults against women a year compared to 40,000 against men. 

So now women are only the rate of rape at FOUR TIMES the rate of men. 

Yeah you can twist the statistics to make it seem like men bear the brunt of sexual violence, but if you make realistic comparisons and look at the culture at large, women still are the main recipient of sexual violence. 

Yes, it's how I feeeeeeeeeel, and the stats back me up.

The only people who bring up ""sacred native ground"" are Indian politicians who are corrupt as fuck and only looking for a headline. 

Shit, when paleontologists found an interesting human speciman that could have shed light on the origin of the first Americans-- [Kennewick Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennewick_Man#Ownership_controversy)--some native activists went nuts and demanded that the remains be returned *immediately* to them. They didn't go crazy because of some hoodoo over whether the speciman needed a ""proper burial"" or some shit. The ONLY reason they started making noise about it was so that they could get some press too. It was total nonesense.

Well I got a 24 pack of Red Dog and when I pulled out of the grocery store parking lot I decided to show off my 350 small-block motor and I peeled my tires out and fishtailed onto the street.

The cops were ***good.*** They had a squad car shadowing me a block away that I could see through people's yards, and almost immediately I saw another squad car's cherries lighting up my rear-view mirror. 

That's when I pulled over. Cop immediately gets out of his car. He sees me and my friend with the 24 pack on her lap. We did not lie about her age (she was underage for alcohol). They pull me out of the car and they asked me how fast I was going. I told them I probably did not exceed the speed limit by that much (heck the speed limit was 30 on the residential streets and I was turning at each block, so I probably *didn't* break the speed limit). They said I was trying to get away from them, and I merely said ""that's crazy."" They asked if I had been drinking, and I said yes. Honestly I had only had three beers, so I passed the field sobriety test.

No one of consequence literally believe in an idyllic matriarchal society that was supplanted a few thousand years ago by a patriarchy. 

Gloria Steinum does not believe in an idyllic matriarchal past. Her work has focused on whether a patriarchy is inevitable, not whether it supplanted a million-year reign of the matriarchy a few millenia ago. 

&gt; The patriarchy is younger now, thanks to growing feminist acceptance of the idea that human society was matriarchal—or at least ""woman-centered"" and goddess-worshipping—from the Paleolithic era, 1.5 to 2 million years ago, until sometime around 3000 BCE.

Read that paragraph again. It takes the so-called ancient ""matriarchy"" (which again, NO
ONE of consequence believes literally) and lumps it in with the academic idea that there were different prevailing forms of ancient religion that involved goddesses. 

So you read the article. Do you still *really* think that anyone of consequence believe  that a matriarchy ruled humanity until a few thousand years ago. Gloria Steinum doesn't believe that.

Of course the first round of school closures would get rid of all below average schools. But the problem is, once you get rid of 50% of the schools, the new average will change so that 50% of the *remaining* schools must be closed. 

This changing average will continue until there is only **one school remaining in the country.** At that point it is only reasonable to start shooting all the below average students until you get to one *very lucky* continually above average student. 

So the headline *should have* said that Hillary wants to close down every school in America except one, where instead of closing it down she would have all but one student murdered.

1923,"It is definitely a good idea to pay the entire balance on a credit card in order to avoid interest charges. 

One thing to keep in mind with the credit rating agencies is that they're not necessarily tracking how timely a consumer pays their bills. They're really trying to measure how much of a debt load a consumer can manage. Be very careful to not allow credit card companies to have you running up the maximum balances you can theoretically bear. It will cost you a fortune in finance charges and it will lower your credit score. You also didn't need any of that stuff anyway, trust me. 

**Keep in mind: Credit agencies work for lenders, NOT consumers.** If your credit score goes down after they've saddled you with large debts, that's good for them. It shows them that this mark is used up and not worth the postage for a credit card offer. 

You should definitely pay off your balances every month. Except people just getting their credit history started should only pay off their balances half the year. They should run up a balance to around 60% and hold it over a month. Make a timely minimum payment. 

Immediately get that thing under 20% for a couple months and then pay it off. 

You save up money in your bank account while using the credit card for your *regular and necessasry* expenses. Then you can manage your repayment schedule to maximize your attractiveness as a consumer of debt. 

Source: I followed this plan and used my wife's credit score as a control. The results were BIG jumps in my credit score 12 months after one of these annual debt cycles while my wife remained static. Since then I've raised my wife's score to match mine using the same method. 

I also do some financial work for people, and have been comfortable enough with the plan to hand it out as advice for clients looking to raise their credit score in a timely manner. 

Pro tip: Use a credit card for Christmas expenses and then retire it for the rest of the year while you pay it off on time. Sit back and watch the credit card offers roll in within 18 months. Don't take 99% of them!",2015-12-23 03:26:23+00:00,cy8kep9,3.0,t1_cy8hxec,4539,AskReddit

1928,"Which discourse have they changed? I have only seen feminists fail throughout the decades. 

For instance, feminists used to be *extremely* hostile to the pornography industry, calling it exploitative and demeaning to women.  Who won that culture war? Pornography is ubiquitous and women take personal grooming cues from the porn actresses. Utter failure. 

There was a time when feminists tried to push the idea that all sex is rape. That idea has been so thoroughly discarded by the culture as a whole that it's held up as an example of feminist hysteria. That concept has *itself* become a punchline. 

Feminists attempted to add language to the Constitution that would have guaranteed women equal rights. It was called the Equal Rights Amendment...and it failed to become law. 

Feminism is generally used as a curse word by normal people here in the US, and except among ivory tower college kids and some bloggers, it has NO traction in the culture.

1992,"The video however, tries to purport that college students were signing up for the ""outright repeal of the 1st Amendment,"" and yet there was *no* video footage of a student agreeing to the outright appeal of the 1st Amendment and then signing the petition. 

The video is dishonestly edited. 

If the video were honest, then--yes--you would get the kind of responses that were noted in the survey done by the the Buckley folks at Yale. 

I take no issue with the number you provided from a survey of 800 students. Look at the numbers, and you'll see this: 

* Nearly a half of students outright oppose or are indifferent to speech codes on campus. 
* A third of college students are against those ridiculous ""trigger warnings"" while a big majority buy into that bullshit.
* Two thirds of students were able to identify the portion of the Constitution that deals with free speech as being the 1st Amendment. Not bad! Remember, some of these people were living with their parents less than a year prior. 
* As many people who were in favor of ""trigger warnings"" (a two thirds super majority) were also ***against*** the idea that the First Amendment  shouldn't protect **hate speech.** 

That's right. A majority of of college kids are in favor of hate speech. They just want a trigger warning before the hate speech I guess...pussies. 

And my absolute favorite statistic is the last one you provide, that says that 30% of self-identified liberal students say the First Amendment is outdated.

Let's extrapolate from that 30%. A [recent survey](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/01/26/survey-finds-freshmen-more-liberal-leaning-academically-focused) said that 47% of college students self-identify as ""middle of the road"" politically. Let's be very generous and give almost all the rest to those who self-identify liberals, say, 50%. That leaves just 3% who self-identify as conservatives. Fair?

If that's the case, then that means **70%** of self-identified liberal college students were *against* the idea that the 1st Amendment is outdated. 

And what's more, that 70% of college kids who are against updating the 1st Amendment goes up *even further* when you include the general college population, which DOUBLES the pool of respondents!

I think your numbers from the William F. Buckley Jr. paint a more moderate picture of college students than most people would expect!

This video was dishonestly edited, and the story it's trying to tell is that a ""solid majority"" of students were in favor of repealing the 1st Amendment. 

How do you jive it with the figures from the survey that shows that 70% of college *liberals* were *against* the idea that the 1st Amendment is outdated.

The average human kidneys can produce roughly 16mL of urine an hour, so if water in = water out then you would have to drink a little over a quarter gallon an hour to keep a steady stream of urine flowing. After 14 or 15 hours of this rate of ingestion you would most certainly be unconscious and on your way to death. An inevitable death that would have been led up to by the increasingly horrifying symptoms of hyponatremia, which is when the salts in your bloodstream get overdiluted. As you keep ingesting water, fatigue and pain would continue growing inside of you--taking over your entire consciousness--until these feelings meld into one, noxious touch of sickness that pervades your entire body until you pass out of consciousness and into the great beyond.

2109,"The animated version of The Lorax is a charming movie with funny characters and great musical numbers. 

But the ending makes so little sense that I can't wrap my head around it.

For those who don't know the story. There's a guy called The Once-ler who invents a consumer product called a ""thneed,"" and demand is so high that he ecologically ***devastates*** an entire region for his own profit. He not only destroyed the homes and ability to survive of thousands of sentient creatures, making them refugees from their own homeland; his unbridled capitalism also changed the culture of the nearby town, turning it into a corporate-fascist nightmare where the population is controlled through surveillance and confinement, and they actively loathe and fear any discussion of the natural world. The natural world is ruthlessly exploited and poisoned to keep these confined citizens quiescent. 

Then after committing all these crimes against nature, culture and people, he retires to a huge house outside of town and does NOTHING for decades!

After being pestered by a 12-year-old kid, the now aged Once-ler reluctantly gives this kid the LAST SEED for the main tree that sustained the area. That's right. He gives a KID the ONLY HOPE for ecological recovery in the area.

Well the kid takes the seed back to town where government goons nearly seize it. Instead it causes a riot and the dictator of the town is murdered by being blown into the sky with a rocket engine. The forest is then replanted. 

After **ALL OF THIS**, the Lorax comes back and tells the Once-ler that he did a ""good job."" WTF?! The Once-ler is the ***REASON THAT ALL THESE BAD THINGS HAPPENED, AND HE DID NOTHING TO MAKE THINGS BETTER! WHY ARE YOU TELLING HIM HE DID A GOOD JOB?***

Then go after personal issues they may have. Do they have a daughter with developmental issues? Call the kid a 'retard' or a 'spaz.' If there is any history of disease in the family, start making fun of that. For instance ""I hope you get cancer and die like your sister"" is a good line. 

Any personal problems should be exploited. Do they drink? Call them an alcoholic, or blame their drinking on why their kid is retarded. Are they divorced? Tell them they are loathsome to potential partners. Death in the family? Tell them the world is better off without that person.

**No, I don't think it's likely that charges would be filed in this EXTREMELY UNLIKELY scenario.**

But if what you're *really* talking about is why it's a worse crime for a man to hit a woman than the other way around, let me direct you to [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism#Humans). There's some interesting stuff in there about inherent biological gender differences between men and women.

* Psychological observation posters - These guys are earnest, yes, but you have to admit they're not your first choice to go to the pub with. These guys will talk about the evolution of the orgasm if you let them. 
* Men's Rights posters - There a lot of guys with some very good reason to be posting about these topics. Bitter people though. Very bitter.

2283,"The 70s and 80s is when the future changed a little bit. 

In the 50s and 60s, with WWII in the recent past, the future was going to be flying cars, space travel and laser guns. It was just accepted that we would have a moon base by the end of the century. 

In the 70s and 80s, it was pretty obvious that in the future, cars wouldn't fly and guns would still shoot bullets and not plasma. The first time I noticed that the future was changing is when I watched Enemy Mine, where war was common, slavery was rife, and people used regular firearms in the future. 

Now think of these other movies that came out in the 70s that show the future: 

* Planet of the Apes had a post-human future because of humanity's failure to contain war. 
* Logan's Run had a fascist future where freedoms were lost. 
* Soylent Green had a future beset with scarcity. 
* TXH 1138 had a future with all the same problems we currently have...but different.  
* The Andromeda Strain showed a future full of biological horrors (again, caused by humans). 

**But the two movies that ABSOLUTELY show the difference between the future predicted by the 50s and 60s and the futures predicted by the 70s and 80s are these:**

**Mad Max** 

Came out in 1979. Flying cars? No. Laser guns? No. Crazy Australians killing each other? Yes. 

**Alien.** 

Also came out in 1979. The movie Alien had a future where roughnecks smoked cigarettes and drank coffee in space while a neo-fascist corporatism takes over humanity. That's the future that people living under Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan saw as a possibility.

The thing is, I think video games bring very little to the table. Gamers have been described as 'wailing hyperconsumers' and I think that's pretty close to the mark. People who obsess over video games do so often at the detriment of their family relationships. I have a brother-in-law who could ***barely*** pull himself away from some video game that just came out to visit his goddamn family. 

There are guys my age (mid-thirties) who have spent HOURS UPON HOURS playing video games over the last 20 years. It's almost like a lost generation of people who wasted a great deal of time and money at the detriment to their social and professional lives. 

Yes, you can spend your entertainment dollars and your time as you wish. But don't try and say that me spending two hours and $5 to watch Citizen Kane to absorb the cinematography and the themes on good and evil is the same as spending hundreds or thousands of hours over years to get better at shooting people in the head.

But at the same time, every asshole and their donkey has a gun down there. When I got my car stuck and I had to hitchhike in northern Mexico, I was kicking the dirt along the side of the road and spent shells were popping up.

2307,"I am going to keep upvoting these questions because I am yet to hear  someone who was the subject of a 'missed connection' on Craigslist. 

The ""missed connection thing has been going on a long time. Heck, twenty years ago I lived in Seattle, and their local weekly paper had an [I Saw You](http://personals.thestranger.com/gyrobase/Personals/ISawYou) section that I would read, wondering if I would ever be the subject of them. 

And that's the exact reason why the 'missed connection' thing exists. 

Think about it. What do you think about when you read the missed connections? If you're single, you almost always put yourself in the shoes of either the submitter of the ad or the subject of the ad. It's like reading a miniature romance novel. 

They're fun and meaningless, I think. Like the horoscopes that are dutifully printed in newspapers around the country. 

Still, if ***ANYONE*** has had a successful hookup by responding to one of these ads, then for the love of god tell your story here. I'm dying to know if 'missed connections' has **EVER** successfully accomplished it purported goal of bringing a secret admirer in touch with the object of their affections.

There's a chick flick that could be made about this kind of situation. 

Get me Katherine Heigl, Cameron Diaz and Ryan Gosling on the phone RIGHT NOW!

Katherine sees Ryan Gosling in the grocery store. She writes a 'missed connection' on Craigslist. Ryan sees it. They get together. Turns out Ryan used to date Cameron Diaz, and he was a real jerk. Cheated on her. She almost breaks up Katherine and Ryan's relationship. Plot twist! Turns out the guy who cheated on Cameron was Ryan's twin brother! 

We do a split screen thing. There will be two Ryan Goslings on screen. One will make up with Cameron and they will get back together. Katherine will see that she was right to trust her heart and will embrace the original Ryan.

Then...an **extremely** graphic four-way sex scene, with Ryan Gosling 1 on Cameron Diaz and Ryan Gosling 2 on Katherine Heigl. 

I'm talking about a headline grabbing kind of sex scene that would make San Fransiscans vote Republican. There will be explicit footage of copulation, oral, vaginal and anal. Will Katherine and Cameron make out? Much more than that my friend. Will there be ***two*** Ryan Goslings servicing Katherine at the same time and then doing the same on Cameron while the other one watches?

Men put it out there, and the woman can take it if she chooses. It's like a sociological metaphor for sex if I ever heard one!

So let's recap: Attractive daughter is surrounded by boys her age who don't have the brains or the balls to talk to her, so she goes without a boyfriend.

When I was 9 my father came home *extremely* drunk from the bar at 2am, which was his modus operandi. My mother was trying to be extremely friendly that night, trying to assuage the beast. 

She had put together a nice, hot meal with candles and white Christmas lights strung around the living room. She had created the most spectacular dinner you can imagine.

My dad started arguing and bitching about the lights, and this argument was *more* serious than the usual drunken asshole banter. The kids were ordered to bed.

My sister (who was three years younger than me, bless her) was convinced that the SHIT WAS GOING DOWN and actually refused to undress to go to bed. I thought she was nuts and took off my pants and got into bed. 

Well my dad and mom started screaming and arguing. But this time it *was* really bad. My mother came screaming to our bedroom, and I jumped up and ran to my sister's room and met my mother and sister there. My mother locked the door, and my dad lunged through the door, smashing it to pieces (it was hollow-cored) and attacked my mom on my sister's bed. 

My mom was missing a golfball sized amount of hair from her scalp and was bleeding all over her face. She beckoned us children to follow her and we ran with her. 

We shuffled out to the road and hailed the next car, and a car picked us up and took us to a motel.

**Remember, I'm not wearing pants.**

The motel owner gave us a room, and he gave me a pair of pants and some oversized shoes. 

I wore those shoes and pants for several days until we got to my uncle's place via train two states over.

Then think about how that conservative beauty pageant contestant Carrie Prejean was received by the press after she came out against gay marriage. Guys like Perez Hilton went after her ***hard*** and even conservative media was cool to her. She didn't even finish her book tour after having a meltdown on CNN. On the other hand a retard like Kirk Cameron can talk shit about gay marriage and no one bats an eye and he was able to get friendlyish press time, even on CNN. 

It's just a different game then you think man. I never saw a woman who was able to run roughshod over all men with impunity.

And both men and women can get chewed up by the media. Sometimes different things can trigger it for men and women, but no gender is exclusively safe from media scrutiny. 

Men and women have different challenges. It's not a zero-sum game where 100% of the power is in the hands of women and men have nothing. It's just not true. I've met powerful men and I've met powerful women. They both play a slightly different game, and they both have advantages and disadvantages related to their gender. 

If you don't know of any strictly feminine problems, or if you don't feel there are circumstances where being a woman can be a disadvantage (and not because she's smaller), you should talk to some of the women in your life about their challenges. I think you would be surprised about what you learn!

Edit: Oh yeah another problem that can be generalized to happen to women is one you might agree with. As a man ages, he typically gets a higher status in the dating game, while a similarly aging woman's dating stock goes *down* as she ages. That's a disadvantage I've heard from older women. It ain't just a woman's world!

As for prison rape it is an issue that should be addressed forcefully, but it's not representative of American society as a whole and very unrepresentative of American women. 

I believe that women have problems that are unique to their gender, and I believe it because I've seen female friends and family go through them. 

And there's no gender struggle in the real world to the extent that people around here say. Maybe there are hotbeds of hostility on the internet and on college campuses, but the place where a VAST majority of Americans live have men and women working side by side in their communities, getting along and valuing each other.

I knew you would bring this one up. Let me explain how that works. In 1997, 9 in 10 rape victims were female and 1 in 10 were male. This was before they used the idea that every sex act while drunk was rape. Okay so it's 90% women and 10% men. Well let's say that 60% of men have had sex drunk and 50% of women have had sex drunk. Well dang that puts the numbers of sexual assaults between men and women at about par. Add in prison rapes, in which every sex act is considered assault and over 90% of the people there long-term are men, well that puts males ahead of females. 

But that's not the world I live in. I'm not in prison. I live in America where somene having a drink before sex is not a crime. Therefore, the world I live in has women as the main victims of sex crimes. Not the only victims, but mostly the victims.

Some prisons are living hellholes for the largely male population that's tossed into them.

It's terrible, but not really helping to paint an accurate picture of the rates of victimizations between men and women. Have you served time in prison?

And also, I guarantee your statistics include men who have drank alcohol before having sex, which is categorized as an assault by the feds when they are putting together these statistics, and these will drive male numbers through the roof compared to women. 

&gt; And you think your women being raped claims aren't full of shit? Lmao yes women never lie about rape. 

Do some women lie about being raped? Yes. It's a travesty and a nightmare to the men who are victims of it. It's not a reason for a gender war. 

&gt; And they never go by ever-widening definitions of rape or sexual assault to claim they were..

Do some cranky female activists take some assault statistics and use them as a cudgel against men? Yes they do, and they sound exactly like Red Pillers when they do it.

I'm sensing some bitterness towards women. Have *you* been victimized by a woman? Where does this bitterness come from?

2460,"Okay I'll give a more substantive response with the ""quote response"" formatting. 

&gt; However if a woman in the same position (age, success, marital status) send a picture of herself spread-eagle she would be PILLORIED.
&gt;&gt; Which is why Jennifer Lawrence's career is in the gutter. Oh wait.

Jennifer Lawrence is young. She is unmarried. She is not established over decades like Brett Favre. The pictures weren't released by Jennifer Lawrence herself. She was not cheating on her husband. I feel it's a different situation than with Brett Favre. 

A better example would be if someone like Jennifer Anniston or Angelina Jolie sent shots of her private parts to someone who wasn't her husband and *then* they became public. She would be known as that nasty hussy who sent beaver shots to the pool boy. That would be similar. Not some unmarried 25 year old singer who had private photos leaked. Do you see how it's different circumstances? 

&gt; Women are the target of stalkers, creeps and rapists.
&gt;&gt; And men are not? Men are laughed out of society if they open up about their rape.

I've never heard of an individual being laughed out of society for discussing sexual assault. I know people like like Tyler Perry or Tim Roth have discussed being victims of sexual abuse, and their careers are still going strong. Also, it doesn't negate the point that women are overwhelmingly the target of stalkers, creeps and rapists at higher percentages of men. 

Please don't send me statistics that say men are equally likely to be victims of sexual assaults as women. Those statistics include people who have had sex while drunk. I have had sex while drunk, and I wouldn't describe the experience as rape. I would describe it as pretty fun. The girl and I both had hangovers the next day. 

&gt; A woman who takes herself and her image very seriously is called a bitch. A man who does the same thing is considered driven. Think about how people would view Steve Jobs if he were a woman?
&gt;&gt; If a woman cries in public, she needs to be comforted. If a man cries in public, LOL WHAT A WIMP

I hope you don't mind if I answer this one with a question: Who's making fun of men crying? To me and anyone I know really, a man crying in public is generally a pretty powerful statement. 

If you look at R/Pics, some very highly-rated pictures are of men crying. This one got [800 points](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/350x5k/man_cries_as_his_dog_passes_away_in_his_arms_from/), this man [crying in public](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/zjm2n/a_friend_snapped_a_shot_of_an_elderly_man_crying/) got 1400 points, and this one got [3400 points](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/25a92u/man_cries_while_playing_goin_home_as_fdrs_body_is/). 

Also, I gotta ask another question: What does a man crying in public have to do with the fact that a driven woman can be called pushy or bitchy? Is it just victim oneupmanship? 

&gt; Women who rely financially on men can be put in terrible situatinos.
&gt;&gt; Here's a thought. If you're that afraid, don't rely on men.

My mother spent 14 years with an abusive husband because she was financially dependent on him (among other things). I wish you could have been there to tell my mother to simply ""not rely"" on her husband, and I wish it was that simple. There are a lot of emotional, financial and social reasons a person would stay with someone who's abusing them. 

Anyway, I hope this is a better response. I don't think I'm winning any hearts and minds around here. There's just a lot of very bitter feelings of blame and victimhood against women around here, and I find it kind of depressing. 

I am close to my mother, my wife and my three daughters. Most of my cousings are female. All aunts are women, I don't have any uncles. All three of my employees are female. I've had female bosses, superiors and clients in the past. I don't worry about anything that TRPer's worry about. I don't even *see* what they see when it comes to the genders. 

If you go out and put your best foot forward to develop relationships with good people, you will always have a pretty good view of everyone.

2484,"Hey SandbergPrinciple I'm going to try and go through your post line by line. I've noticed that there are a LOT of people on Reddit who have the same gripes about women as you do, but perhaps some conversation can raise your appreciation of women. 

&gt; They have thousands of dicks thrown their way at an early age and thirsty men willing to do ANYTHING for them for even a remote chance that they'll hold their hand.

I have dated women and I have a dating-age daughter, and I don't see how this is true. Girls do NOT have all the power in the sex game. Boys in fact hold a LOT of the cards. Girls can be labeled all sorts of bad things if they have a sexual relationship with a guy who doesn't care about them. When you get intimate with a girl, you are not only holding her knockers in your hand, but you are holding her entire reputation. Be respectful and you will get girls all day long!

&gt; Then you have society telling them that they're special, that they can't be held accountable for their actions (i.e. women have 63% shorter sentences for the same crime that men do, are twice as likely not to even go to jail for the same crimes).

The same thing could be said about white men, but as a white man I don't feel like I'm not held accountable. I feel like other people (especially blacks and Hispanics) are getting the shaft.

&gt;  Sometimes aren't even presumed to be rapists when they have sex with children, responsibility for consensual sex are 100% on men etc. etc.

This complaint comes up a LOT by guys on Reddit. I don't understand the obsession with the ""rapist woman"" that people are so afraid of around here. In my experience, the most dangerous sex predators have ALWAYS been men. I have a large family (and mostly female oddly enough) and the number of them that have been stalked, sexually assaulted, drugged and/or raped is very high. The number of males that I know that have been stalked, sexually assaulted, drugged and/or raped is exactly zero. Why are people so obsessed with this nearly mythical female rapist? 

&gt; You give them shortcuts instead of working hard (i.e. special programs to get women into STEM in college and big tech companies reserving hiring slots SOLEY for women).

Men make more money and have an easier time in business. Men will always dominate STEM and business despite the lame efforts made to get more of them in there. You will not likely ever have your job or college course taken by a less-qualified woman. 

Also, women are not taken as seriously in the business world as men are. I know I myself am guilty of discounting the opinion of a woman in a business setting largely because of her gender. And the fact that she was a fucking bubblehead. 

&gt; It's no WONDER that women are spoiled little monsters. Imagine giving a child unlimited money, how would they grow up to value money when they have all of it?

The trucker got the hint and pulled over. Sparking lift gate no big deal. 

If you're pulling over a car you should just pull beside them and gesture to the side of the road. 

Or try what police officers refer to as a PIT maneuver where you make contact with the bumper offset from center on either side of the rear and then you accelerate, causing the car to spin and most likely come to a stop in the ditch. 

Also, if you happen to have a firearm on you it is possible to shoot out one or more tires which will cause the driver to pull to the side of the road in most cases.

2528,"I can see why the picture looks funny. But there's a few things going on. 

First of all, his hand is not going much higher than his shoulder. If you want to compare the pose I did with grandpa's arm behind Obama, you can see that it's possible to go way higher. [Check out the picture.](http://imgur.com/EFr6HXJ)

But let's discuss the fact that you think his arm is going straight down. There's a couple things going on here. First of all, he's wearing shoulder pads, which pushes fabric out *over* the arm itself, obscuring it's actual angle. Also, what appears to be light shining between Obama's arm and grandpa's arm from behind is *actually* the reflection from his leather jacket. [Check out this closer picture with some notes.](http://imgur.com/UPVQoaV)

Now I decided to recreate the picture with my arm again, but this time using a jacket with shoulder pads. [Check it out](http://imgur.com/5eKhnXK). See how the angle appears to go straight down coming from the shoulder? That's the power of shoulder pads, bro. 

If you want a picture of where the arm is probably going in outline, check out this [very potato quality diagram I did.](http://imgur.com/pkbmC1d). Basically, the exact moment that grandpa's arm disappears behind the sunlight on Obama's jacket, his arm kicks out and back and then over the shoulder, like he was trying to get that hand on there before the photo was taken. 

Now let's put this shoulder-padded hand onto grandpa's arm and see what happens? [See this?](http://imgur.com/s9JWtRY) It's a pretty good match. If you zoom in to the picture you can see a small bit of grandpa's original jacket going behind Obama's jacket, so you can see I'm not taking ANY liberties with where this arm might be. It still works pretty good but I got the angle of my hand wrong, but grandpa's not reaching over towards grandma, he's reaching over Obama's shoulder.

So there you go. It's a funny-looking photograph, but I don't think there's signs of tampering. ",2015-10-11 21:44:22+00:00,cvw8u3z,3.0,t1_cvw5qg9,4905,AskReddit

I recently watched this thing and wondered why anyone would EVER find it interesting. The whole thing is a bunch of girls wondering if they're going to get a boyfriend. Then they enthrall you with songs that go like this:

&gt; We will dance the Hootchie-koochie 

&gt; You will be my tootsie-woosie

If any 70 year olds want to say that modern songs are dumb, well they may want to think about a second. 

Also speaking of songs, each one more insipid the last, well have of them are sung in this family's home. There are hardly ANY SETS in the film. I wanted to changed the lyrics from ""Meet me in St. Louis, Louis. Meet me at the fair"" to ""Meet me in the living room. Meet me at the stairs."" Oh yeah they sing on the staircase in the living room to mix things up. 

And speaking of the fair. In St. Louis. Well after spending the entire LONG running time talking about this fair (and some other plot lines that are never resolved), they *finally* go to the fair. 

And you don't see the fair. And they don't meet anyone there. Some stagehands flashed some lights on the actors' faces while Judy Garland talks about how beautiful this fair is. And, the end. 

The film never goes to the fair. And nothing interesting happened. And this show is enormously popular on Rotten Tomatoes?! **It has a 100% approval rating!** ***Why?!!***

And if you say that the show was a musical and thus it was all about the songs, well I submit to you that the songs are dull, slow and insipid. Please read the lyrics above. 

Besides, there was WAY better music at that time. What if they had done a musical about [this guy](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=y-kJqM7he9o). 

That's Cab Calloway and he was putting together music that still stuns to this day a full decade before St Louis came out. 

And if there had been a musical based on Calloway's musical stylings **it would have been considered the most seminal musical in American history and a required study for all music majors.**

Do you know why that musical was never made? Because America was deeply, deeply racist. 

That is all. I don't like that movie. 

Tl;dr - Contemplating ""Meet Me in St Louis"" reminds you of your nation's shameful historical flaws. And it sucked. 

**The real tl;dr - If you like Meet me in St. Louis you are a racist.** Or gay, which is cool for you guys because it has Judy Garland in it. ",2015-10-11 06:33:24+00:00,cvvllhb,1.0,t3_3oas2s,6808,AskReddit

These decisions had a huge influence on the rest of my life, and I wouldn't deny any other teenager the right to make some of those decisions. 

My 17 year old daughter has already made enormous decisions in her life. She's had log term boyfriends. One was - gasp - 20 years old. Should that 20 year old be in prison for 10 years?! Should I lock my 17 year-old in the basement until she can ""make decisions?"" Or should I put her on birth control and give her the strength and confidence and mental abilities to start making decisions?

My proudest day is when my 17 year old told me that she thought her ex-boyfriend (the 20 year old) was an ""immature douche."" My heart swelled with pride. 

Don't infantilize teenagers. You'll only create weak-ass, decaffeinated adults.

First of all, it's quiet. And you'll hear noises that you would *never* hear even with some mild ambient noise. 

Also, the hours just before dawn are the coldest ones of the night. When something with all sorts of various building materials cool down, they tend to make snapping, clicking or groaning noises. Your house does it.

So at this moment I would like ask the following people to cool their heels this election season. Not that you shouldn't vote or give money, but please just tone down the rhetoric for 2016 if you are one of the following people:
 
* Anti-gun west-coast hybrid-car owners
* Bike lane proponents
* People who have pondered whether GLBTA is an inclusive enough acronym 
* Cat-owning PETA members who are concerned with public pedestrian access to beach fronts (you know who you guys are)
* Social Justice Warriors or anyone whose eyebrows raise when someone  uses the term ""mankind"" (especially you guys STFU please)
* Black Muslims who want to wear veils or dashikis or leather hats or bow ties. Stick to prison/sentencing reform. 
* Anti-pornography feminists
* Anti-feminist gamers (you guys have as much appeal to wider America as feminists, and are just as much the navel-gazers as they are)
* People who correct others for using the term ""American"" to refer to Americans (honestly no one cares that your parents spoke Portuguese)

The following people on the other hand are invited to this year's election cycle and need to stand up: 

* Environmental activist whackos
* Wealth redistributors and economic justice warriors (just don't bring up Marx for crissakes, even as an academic reference)
* Gun owners with dreadlocks/Subarus (If you have a gun rack on your Subaru, stick to the Adirondacks ya cracker)
* Drug law reformers and High Times subscribers (Not R/Trees subscribers. No one wants to hear about young people smoking pot)
* Anti-factory farm activists (just don't join the Earth Liberation Front...or PETA)
* Prisoner reform and sentencing reform activists - THIS IS YOUR TURN YOU SOFT-ON-CRIME PANSIES!
* Gay Montanan ranchers
* Straight Montanan ski lodge employees
* Young people with jobs who pay their own cell phone bills

2638,"Starting when I was around 8 years old I had terrifying nighttime experiences. I would find myself awake suddenly,  and these creatures with large eyes would enter my room. Usually I would become so panicked that I would black out. In the mornings I would sometimes wake up in a different place in the house from where I fell asleep, and I would have vivid snippets of frightening, malevolent beings that would visit me and even move me in the night. 

I found an old book about alien abductions, and I realized that what I was reading about happening to other people was **happening to me!** When I realized that this was a ***real thing***, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up and my stomach boiled with anxiety. 

And the visits happened over and over again. And they got worse and more terrifying. I didn't just black out when the beings would enter my room in the night, but I stayed semi-conscious as they would move about. I was unable to move, and they would be hovering over me, pulling and pressing on me; lifting me up and spinning me around both axes of my body; they would pull and bend my arms and legs. I was utterly helpless, and it happened over and over again...for years. 

I began telling my parents, and my schoolmates and my teachers at school. I tried to communicate with the aliens with a walkie-talkie in my backyard. I became intensely interested in all things alien. When the movie ""Fire in the Sky"" came out I had a panic attack in the theater and felt like I would black out.

The visits continued for years, but my perspective on them changed. I stopped believing they were aliens or any kind of being. For a while I thought that I might've had a mental disorder or epilepsy. Eventually I learned about night terrors. 

My mother told me that the school called her and told her how I talked about being abducted. She just laughed it off. When I look back on it, the times when the alien visits were the most intense was when my dad's drinking and mental problems were at thier worst. When my mother left him with us kids the visits from aliens tapered off.

Same as the 7th Day Adventists, another offshoot of which became the Branch Davidians. 

Anyway, the rules that are settled on by Jehovah's Witnesses are not meant to hold them closer to any Biblical behavior. It's really meant to isolate them from the rest of the population and thus be able to reinforce the *rightness* of their religion with only other believers. 

JW's also outlaw the celebrations of *any* holidays except for a single passover ceremony at the Kingdom Hall (the **church** for all you unbelievers destined to Gehenna). That along with birthdays being forbidden already makes a JW more culturally *different* than even first-generation immigrants. 

Add the prohibition on dating, marrying or even spending too much liesure time with non-believers makes them even more separated. The JW church even teaches that if you can avoid it, don't ***work*** with non Jehovah's Witnesses. 

Add the ban on smoking cigarettes, masturbating, pre-marital sex, voting, serving in the military, taking ***blood transfusions***, etc, you have a people group of morally-superior and aloof people who bite their nails over the morality of their own actions.

2723,"Every time I see this kind of post I've decided I'm going to copy and paste something I did that has the motiviations (as I saw them) for all the Republican candidates in 2012. I worked as a radio producer during that time, and I hope this can give you insight into what kinds of reasons people run for president have. 

**Mitt Romney - He ran to win the presidency.** He was so convinced by his skewed internal polling that he was going to win that his campaign had purchased some $25,000 worth of fireworks to light off in Boston after the announcement of their victory. Har. 


**Herman Cain - He ran to secure a talk radio gig.** Herman Cain had an AM talk radio show in Atlanta, a big urban market. He lost his spot on WSB-AM to Michael Savage. After dropping out of the race he got his slot back. Good for him. He's a card!


**Newt Gingrich - He ran to win the presidency, and if not win at least write a book.** Not a very likable guy. And not a very good guy. An aide of his used to advise visitors of Newt Gingrich to ""compliment the speaker on his weight loss."" And most people did I imagine. 


**Donald Trump - He ran to promote his TV show 'The Apprentice' and to add Presidential Candidate to his resume.** He dropped out of the race before the season premiere of 'The Apprentice.' Nuff said. 


**Ron Paul - He ran to maintain his libertarian bonafides.** Media people tend to have a dim view of Ron Paul, and I'm afraid I caught it. With an implacable core of supporters that do not have a chance of growing into a movement that can put a man into the presidency, he can't win. But he also can't lose. ""Presidential candidate"" is a ***much*** better title than *cranky senator from Texas.""


**Rick Perry - He ran to win the presidency.** Seriously. And he's doing it again with reading glasses on. But why not? He's a good ol' boy who's not afraid to gamble other people's money for a shot at the ultimate prize of the presidency. Given the price to play and the potential pay off, why the hell *not* run?


**Michele Bachmann - She ran for conservative bonafides.** There are a lot of odd things that Michele Bachmann believes, but the idea that she could win the presidency is not one of them. 

***PURELY SPECULATIVE FROM NOW ON***


**John Huntsman - He ran perhaps to make a statement?** Huntsman was an educated, moderate, cosmopolitan, Chinese-speaking ambassador with an excellent resume. He was so far outside of the Republican zeitgeist that he just didn't get much attention. 


**Rick Santorum - He ran for Bonafides maybe?** I can't speculate as to what's in Santorum's heart. He was never taken too seriously by the media in general. However, that Christian dog whistle he blows makes a lot of people pay attention. . All I know from my experience with Christian-national-types is that the movement is filled with sociopaths, fanatics, and grifters. That's a fact. 



***BONUS DEMOCRAT MOTIVATION SPECULATION***


**Bill Richardson - He ran to be Hilary Clinton's Vice President.** This is purely speculative but seeing what a suck-up he was to Hillary during the debates it's possible it could be the case. 



***Disclaimer*** This is the speculation of a single radio producer and should be taken with a grain of salt. ",2015-07-15 17:58:34+00:00,ct4dyrl,1.0,t3_3defcc,3447,AskReddit

2728,"It's funny. Every time I've brought up that I worked in radio, people always ask if I had training.

The truth is I took some communications classes in college before I dropped out. I got the job through a tip from a friend, and I played up my radio experience. A LOT. I put down that I had worked at a college radio station when in fact I had once drunkenly wandered into the studio with a friend. 

Funny thing was, I worked at an unlicensed (aka pirate) radio station in Knoxville spinning records and also doing an hour-long talk-show. I put that down as working at a ""community radio co-op"" or some nonesense. 

So really, I had no training except that I LOVED talk radio, and thought it was the most powerful form of media possible. It's a pure verbal connection that relies solely on humanity's most primal form of communication. So I listened to every type of talk radio. News radio, comedy radio, those well-produced long-form shows from NPR like 'This American Life:' They all gave me some education on how radio works. 

Also, I used to listen to a talk radio show out of Baltimore called the Don &amp; Mike show, and it was really the height of lifestyle/comedy talk radio. They talked CONSTANTLY about the business and technical aspects of radio, and I learned a LOT from them. My college courses in broadcasting were a joke. 

So I got the job and then just started cranking out material that I thought the hosts could use. And they started using it. I was once was asked to write a segment for Rush Limbaugh by my company as a favor to some journalist who wanted to get his story out. That was fun just for the notoriety of it. 

But talk radio has become just a bunch of sad-sack shouting. There's hardly any art to it. And the conservative takeover of talk radio is a real bummer. They are fanatical and have no love of the truth. The whole right-wing media game is full of vicious climbers and backstabbers. 

So I got out of it. I said goodbye to radio and now I prepare taxes and do business consulting.

***Herman Cain - He ran to secure a talk radio gig. ***Herman Cain had an AM talk radio show in Atlanta, a big urban market. He lost his spot on WSB-AM to Michael Savage. After dropping out of the race he got his slot back. Good for him. He's a card!


***Newt Gingrich - He ran to win the presidency, and if not win at least write a book.*** Not a very likable guy. And not a very good guy. An aide of his used to advise visitors of Newt Gingrich to ""compliment the speaker on his weight loss."" And most people did I imagine.


***Donald Trump - He ran to promote his TV show 'The Apprentice' and to add Presidential Candidate to his resume.*** He dropped out of the race before the season premiere of 'The Apprentice.' Nuff said.


***Ron Paul - He ran to maintain his libertarian bonafides. ***Media people tend to have a dim view of Ron Paul, and I'm afraid I caught it. With an implacable core of supporters that do not have a chance of growing into a movement that can put a man into the presidency, he can't win. But he also can't lose. ""Presidential candidate"" is a much better title than *cranky senator from Texas.""


***Rick Perry - He ran to win the presidency. ***Seriously. And he's doing it again with reading glasses on. But why not? He's a good ol' boy who's not afraid to gamble other people's money for a shot at the ultimate prize of the presidency. Given the price to play and the potential pay off, why the hell not run?


***Michele Bachmann - She ran for conservative bonafides. ***There are a lot of odd things that Michele Bachmann believes, but the idea that she could win the presidency is not one of them.

PURELY SPECULATIVE FROM NOW ON



*** John Huntsman - He ran perhaps to make a statement? *** Huntsman was an educated, moderate, cosmopolitan, Chinese-speaking ambassador with an excellent resume. He was so far outside of the Republican zeitgeist that he just didn't get much attention.


*** Rick Santorum - He ran for Bonafides maybe? ***  I can't speculate as to what's in Santorum's heart. He was never taken too seriously by the media in general. However, that Christian dog whistle he blows makes a lot of people pay attention. . All I know from my experience with Christian-national-types is that the movement is filled with sociopaths, fanatics, and grifters. That's a fact.

2773,"I read the first few lines of your proposal and then jumped immediately to the comment box. 

Here's the thing. You obviously are good at your job. You have the stats (at least from what I gathered by skimming your proposal). 

However the only way you can get a pay raise is by being able to walk away from the job if they don't meet your pay expectations. If you're so good at your job then you should be working on marketing that ability to not only your current employer but to *any* employer. 

Think about it from your employer's perspective: Why would they give you more money? Just because your manager is ""on your side"" and you have a solid proposal is not good enough. You must make your employer bid for your services. 

Edit: I just read your entire post and I saw the thing about how you would like to stay at your current post. My advice remains the same: You MUST be willing to quit over your lack of pay. If you show some balls along with your numbers, then you might get it! Confidence pays (unless it doesn't, in which case happy job-hunting!).
