A friend is a most precious gift to all of us. We should always understand its importance and give value without having any misunderstanding. Friendship is a relationship where no any blood relation exists. It is a limitless relation goes forever without the rule of give and take. It is the special and unique relation of love and affection to any other person in the world. True friendship never sees the caste, creed, religion and colour of person; it only sees the internal beauty, simplicity and soul of the two or three person going to be involved in the friendship.


Friend of anyone is someone with whom one may feel comfortable and belief to each other as well as share their thoughts, ideas and personal feelings. Friend is one with whom we can feel safe and secure and do not need to think twice for any matter. True friends involved in the friendship love each other unconditionally and understand each other need without judging on the matter. They always ready to support each other and provide good knowledge and advice. There is a most famous friendship of Krishna and Sudama in India which has become a great example of true friendship from the ancient time. There is a common saying about the friendship by the Elbert Hubbard “A friend is someone who knows all about you and still loves you.”


A true friend always stands together and helps whenever another one need help and support. A true friend never cares his/her own important works and leaves all works to help friends. He/she never leave a friend alone especially during the difficult times of life. It is said that time takes hard exams of true friends in their difficult times. Actually difficult time is a best time which realizes us about the value and importance of true friends. The people having true friends in the life are really blessed with most precious gifts. Making number of friends in the life does not matter with the quality of friendship. True friends (whether one, two or three) are enough for whole life; instead of having many friends who never understand the situation of the needy one. Friends are the real supporter in life who teaches us how to face difficulties of life. They are the real well wishers of us who changes our bad viewpoints about anything for good.
