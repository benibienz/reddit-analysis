I was masturbation for about 45 minutes, I had lost my full erection to about 80% erect, it then returned to full size and I finished. I cleaned up and went downstairs to watch tv, I immediately felt a burning sensation like rug burn so I didn't think anything of it, it was almost painless. About three hours later, I went to put lotion on it and I noticed it swelling. I think I may just something with my lymphatic system. But I am horrified and about to call 911. Please provide some help.

Hey guys, I will be installing a two water blocks on to my 980 Ti  G1 Gaming
cards. I have never installed a water block or a custom water loop, I'm a
bit afraid of doing this but I feel the drive to have lower temperature
readings. I need help getting the cooling components, I have found the water
blocks from EKWB. I need some guidance on how to get all the parts I need to
create this. I want my cards running under 55c under load.  I currently have
a HAF 932 Advanced case, with a Cooler Master Nepton 240MM mounted on the
top for my CPU. My cards are SLI sitting on a Z97 Sabretooth TUFF 3.1
Motherboard. I have 4 Noctua 120 ULN Fans on the side intake, this does
lower the temps a few degrees but the top card is running at 72c under load.

I would be willing to move that radiator or remove it to make room for a
graphics card radiator. I could throw a NH-D15S  in there. 

What size radiator do I need? (I think a 240MM would work)
Is there anything that is prebuilt that I can just plug into the water
blocks?
Any online stores that does this?
Could I use a premade one from EK?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
