just see if your team have good heroes for ganking (qop, pudge, bounty, riki, night stalker, legion) or your team and adapt your wards. ",2016-08-02 02:52:57+00:00,d60j73g,5.0,t1_d60j0gd,282.0,DotA2

this is stupid.
i calibrated at 1.3k mmr and never again went to ranked matchmaking again. started playing with my friends (4k+) and got better at the game. made a smurf and calibrated at 3.8k, but still, my main account is in 2k because i NEVER PLAY RANKED.

this argument is so bad it gives me cancer.
