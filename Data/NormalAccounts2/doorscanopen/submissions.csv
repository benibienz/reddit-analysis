* POPPY [W] - Hard counters nearly all high mobility assassins.

* Twisted Fate [R] - Grants you vision on all enemy champions.

* Tahm Kench [W] - You should pick this if they have 9 assassins

* Janna - Flair

* Lulu [E] - Grants you vision on champions.

* Kayle [R] - Brief Immortality

* Karma [W] - Grants you vision on champions.

* Lee sin [E] - To grant vision on the invisible champion, but don't play lee sin.

* Reksai [W] Tremor Sense can be used to detect the nearby enemy invisible champion.

Damage Item list:

1) HOURGLASS

2) Sterak's gage - To potentially survive burst.

3) Executioner's calling is recommended if they have form of sustain ability.

4)Edge of night - Channel for 1.5 second to grant a spell shield that blocks the next enemy ability. Lasts for 10 seconds ( 45 second cooldown). (can move while channeling, but taking damage breaks the channel.)

5) Frost Queen's Claim - Decent against invisible champions, because the item can reveal invisible champions from a distance.

Hi I've just recently graduated high school and wishing to become a Educational streamer for league of legends community while being in college. So one of my goals to increase the community support population cause as it's seems currently quite low in numbers. Another goal would make sure my students achieve the rank they desire, but I'll have more goals to achieve hopefully I can help from reddit.

Stream will be June 18th 4:20 pm Eastern

Example List of topics I'll be covering and more:

How punish enemy Adc during laning phrase.

How to position depending what support you play

How to properly ward and build

Cool warding tricks and locations.

How to properly prepare an objective to safely secure it.

How properly peel for your Team

How to carry an entire game as a support.

The buff will be when support item is brought  they will be able to place two pinks or ability to have 4/4 wards placed.(NOT BOTH preferred)

Note A: Make it so jungler can't purchase a support item and jungle item.(I'm saving you lp)

Note B:Logically it makes most sense for it to be only for the support eye items to be able place 4/4 ward down, basically changing unique passive when 1st or 2nd dragon is obtained.
