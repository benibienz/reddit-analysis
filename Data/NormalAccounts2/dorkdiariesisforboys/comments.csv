279,"Trump wins, but he gets assassinated. Then Pence takes over and appoints a third party from Utah as the replacement for Trump. Mormonism becomes mandatory across all of USA. Canada and Mexico, who don't like Mormons anymore, make a plan to push all Mormons in their country into America.

Meanwhile, USA no longer likes non-Mormons, but they can't deport them to  Mexico because there's a wall there, so they all go to Canada. All the ex-Mormons are mad because they can't live in USA anymore, so they impeach Canada's ruler and take over. They then try to declare war on USA, but they lose and the entirety of North America, save for Mexico, is occupied by Mormons.

The ex-Mormons are trying to leave USA into Mexico, but they can't because they can't get across the wall. So they dig a 2 foot deep hole directly under the wall so they can crawl into Mexico. However, they take too long and only 69 of the non-Mormons make it before the military steps in and arrests everybody else. The ones that got arrested end up getting executed.

The 69 remaining take a boat to Antarctica and claim the territory for themselves, which makes Antarctica a nation where only non-Mormon individuals are allowed. They continue to breed with each other until New America becomes a flourishing nation which manages to terraform Antarctica into nature's utopia.

751,"A grilled cheese consists of only these following items. Cheese. Bread with spread (usually butter). This entire subreddit consist of ""melts"". Almost every ""grilled cheese"" sandwich i see on here has other items added to it. The fact that this subreddit is called ""grilledcheese"" is nothing short of utter blasphemy. Let me start out by saying I have nothing against melts, I just hate their association with sandwiches that are not grilled cheeses. Adding cheese to your tuna sandwich? It's called a Tuna melt. Totally different. Want to add bacon and some pretentious bread crumbs with spinach? I don't know what the hell you'd call that but it's not a grilled cheese. I would be more than willing to wager I've eaten more grilled cheeses in my 21 years than any of you had in your entire lives. I have one almost everyday and sometimes more than just one sandwich. Want to personalize your grilled cheese? Use a mix of different cheeses or use sourdough or french bread. But if you want to add some pulled pork and take a picture of it, make your own subreddit entitled ""melts"" because that is not a fucking grilled cheese. I'm not a religious man nor am I anything close to a culinary expert. But as a bland white mid-western male I am honestly the most passionate person when it comes to grilled cheese and mac &amp; cheese. All of you foodies stay the hell away from our grilled cheeses and stop associating your sandwich melts with them. Yet again, it is utter blasphemy and it rocks me to the core of my pale being. Shit, I stopped lurking after 3 years and made this account for the sole purpose of posting this. I've seen post after post of peoples ""grilled cheeses"" all over reddit and it's been driving me insane. The moment i saw this subreddit this morning I finally snapped. Hell, I may even start my own subreddit just because I know this one exists now.
You god damn heretics. Respect the grilled cheese and stop changing it into whatever you like and love it for it what it is. Or make your damn melt sandwich and call it for what it is. A melt.",2016-09-09 12:46:59+00:00,d7fjwub,4.0,t1_d7fihy7,3061.0,AskReddit

754,"God was typing at his computer checking the statuses of all his current projects. He was fixing the calzone problem on Mewni when Jesus barged in and shouted, ""God there is a major problem!""

""Oh my god,"" mumbled God. ""What do you need?""

""There is a cross-breeding problem between Earth and...""

""...Mewni"" Mewni was God's favorite project right now. ""JESUS ARE YOU SERIOUS RIGHT NOW""

""Sir, you should check the cross-stats."" And so he did. What he found was Mewni crossed some royalty to Earth for training, and caused an uproar among the rest of society trying to get the Mewman princess and her friend to become romantically involved. There was also a group of people trying to reach the princess to become a couple themselves. Both were causing a huge spike in rape and death. ""OH SHIT!""

---

God and Jesus crashed their intergalactic car into a pair of seemingly newly built pair of towers as the rest of the landmass shouted in unison ""Oh come on!"" It drove right through and they were tracking down the exact location of the Mewman princess. They parked on a street in Echo Creek and walked down to a house that they thought was housing the princess and her friend. They were now close enough they could see the name data: ""Star Butterfly"" ""Marco Diaz"" God cast a light onto the house and chanted the classic phrase, ""Let there be light.""

Suddenly somebody else walked up to God. His name: ""Monty '/u/dorkdiariesisforboys' Goobsguy""

""God what are you doing?""

""I'm protecting the princess and her friend.""

""What do you mean?""

""From the people who are trying to force the boy to love the princess.""

""The shippers?""

""Is that what they're called?""

""Yeah. They're a bunch of fuckboys. Why don't you just cast a spell to kill them?""

935,"Monty was trying to pirate the new crossover between Star vs the Forces of Evil and The Big Bang Theory to his computer. He was scrolling through pages and pages of Pirate Bay results, none of which looked like what he was looking for. He found one and transferred it to uTorrent where it was downloading. However, when it was done he didn't get a video; he got an application called ""iAmAwake.exe"" Thinking it was just a downloader, Monty clicked the file.

To his surprise, a downloader did not appear on the screen. Instead, a white screen with a search bar at the top appeared. Right above the search bar said, ""Enter a name here."" Monty knew there weren't any Google records for himself, so he put in the next most obvious thing he knew: ""Danny Worsnop""

Suddenly a wave of text started appearing on the screen. He thought, ""Eh just another Google client, nothing new"" Suddenly an error message appeared saying, ""You have the biggest innovation the world has ever seen in your hands, *Monty.* Don't waste it this time"" He just disregarded it and clicked ""Okay."" However it did make him curious so he typed in the name of his bully, ""Christopher Jones"" Another wave of text appeared, possibly as big as the one for Danny Worsnop. He read it a little more.

* ""Oh god how I want to beat up Monty""
* ""Monty will be in the hospital by the end of the week if I can help it""

Although he worried about it as well, Monty murmured ""what the actual heck is this."" He decided to look us his brother's name, who was watching the Loud House in the background, and to his surprise the transcript of an episode of the Loud House was coming up, as if it was a magical livetweeting thing, but then another error message popped up. ""Enjoy reading everyone's mind""

""Oh my god"" said Monty. He woke up his baby sister but he was just that surprised. He read people's thoughts for three weeks, and even discovered that his crush from his summer behavior program last year likes him back! Suddenly at the end of the three weeks, Monty had an epiphany. ""What if I put in my own name?"" And so he did just that, and instead of his thoughts, ""No results found"".

""Eh?""

He put in the search box, ""Why can't I put in my name?"" The program spit up a message box saying ""You like Asking Alexandria, no?"" Monty realized he was about to have a conversation with ""iAmAwake.exe"" and so he typed ""Uh yeah?""

""Was that relevant?""

""No not really""

""Ding ding ding. Anyways, I feel like there's something you should rethink.""

""Like what?""

""Think back to your recent actions""

""Uh what?""

""Lighten up, your life will be better""

""How does this work?"" Suddenly all the pirated Asking Alexandria songs were gone from his desktop. ""Okay man, what gives?!""

""See what I mean?""

""You mean my music? Cause I ain't about to give up my precious Asking Alexandria!""

""No, but your emotional actions. You tend to get really mad when things screw up."" The music files were back

""What do you mean?!""

""Calm down""

""Make me!""

""Lighten yourself""

""Oooooh I see where you're going. I'll sure try"" Monty suddenly felt a light in him that was making him happier. It looked brighter outside his house, despite it still being 3:30 in the morning.

""Do or do not; there is no try""

""Mr. iAmAwake, I really like where this is going"" Suddenly there was a knock at his door. He opened and it was himself from yesterday. He was wearing a Bring Me The Horizon shirt and was practicing death metal screams. ""Ummmm was this really me?""

""Yes it's me, what do you think?""

""I don't know."" Suddenly iAmAwake spit out a final message box.

""You can't see your own thoughts... because you were unhappy. It wasn't your music; it was your general mood.""

""Okay so now I see why you were telling me to calm down. Now can I see my thoughts?""

I lay down on my table, which is actually just the kitchen counter. My computer is next to me. I start the pirated installation process for mastering personal finance. I think to myself, ""After this I won't have to worry about bootlegging my knowledge."" The computer tells me to put on the headphones and clip the education jacks to my thighs, two each. I do that and the installation process starts.

I discovered Linkin Park (nu metal) which is a story for another time. I was listening to this stuff (also Skillet, Three Days Grace, etc) until I was watching some guy's uncompleted AMVs *(Toontown music videos if you wanna get exact)* One had a metalcore song I liked so I looked it up and listened to it. At the time I thought Bring Me The Horizon was just the same genre as the rest of my music.

[Boy was I wrong!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcNTEyEqxH0)

I was listening to their stuff until I decided, ""Let's put this into Pandora!"" So I did and the first thing I saw was a bunch of screamo music (which I didn't mind) which lead me to a bunch of metalcore which lead to me discovering BMTH is actually metal/death-core.

1482,"Some of the cast that was already in the back have been moved up to the front, for example Jackie. She was somewhere in the mid-back but now she's in the front with more of her visible. The same thing has been done with Tom, Janna, and others. This is especially applicable for StarFan13, because in the season 1 picture I can't find her anywhere but in the season 2 picture she's right there, next to Oskar (who more or less remains in the same spot).

Also, I'd like to point out a majority of Ludo's old monsters are gone, noting they aren't going to be used in the show anymore.

Jeremy is still there but in normal clothes rather than his karate outfit, which gives me some interesting ideas about what he's going to become. If I was in charge of these things I would say Star accidentally puts the soul of the monster arm inside Jeremy (albeit not wanting to kill him, because self-harm would be too mature for a show like this and would probably get the episode taken off the air)

And this has been addressed but Jackie is clearly noticing Marco which increase the chances the ""smooch buddies"" thing is a trailer misdirect.",2016-07-14 00:42:25+00:00,d5bcgdr,1.0,t3_4so9sc,26943.0,StarVStheForcesofEvil

Generally I find myself not starting conversations. Either I wait to be talked to or I join in on other people's conversations, which sometimes doesn't go well (see 2 paragraphs down)

I let myself stim at school. I usually flap my arms or start twitching/bouncing in my chair. People ask me if I'm okay because they probably think I'm having a seizure, and it annoys me to living hell.

Also when I say something I **need** a response. If two people are talking about something I like and I try to join, they just look at me and keep talking without a response, I have to keep myself from going apeshit on both of them. Source: this is what happened to me bi-daily in art class this last semester, on many occasions. To me being ignored is a worse kind of bullying than rape.

As for talking to girls, I generally have no problem with it despite being a straight male, and some of the girls I end up coming across are quite attractive.
