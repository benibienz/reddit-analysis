p.s. ""Half-assed-ism"" isn't funny.

**THANKS**

I've looked at most other churches and they weren't for me so I've always gone under irreligious. However I do believe that there is a supreme being and that there are basic rules for us (ten commandments) but I don't believe in anything else. Is there a name for this form of religion/atheism?

**Edits**

I have a modified version of the Ten Commandments that I like to call the Five Commandments:

* Honor Your Father and Mother
* You Shall Not Murder
* You Shall Not Commit Adultery
* You Shall Not Steal
* You Shall Not Bear False Witness Against Your Neighbor

Also I am NOT Jewish or a convert from Jewism.

***PLEASE READ***

What I'm deciding to do is classify myself into a religion I came up with myself:

Halfism

All feedback whether it be before or after I posted this is appreciated and more than welcome, but I thought I'd say this since we can't really figure out what I should really be.

***I've reached a conclusion***

He was scrolling through pages and pages of Pirate Bay results, none of which looked like what he was looking for. He found one and transferred it to uTorrent where it was downloading. However, when it was done he didn't get a video; he got an application called ""iAmAwake.exe"" Thinking it was just a downloader, Monty clicked the file.

To his surprise, a downloader did not appear on the screen. Instead, a white screen with a search bar at the top appeared. Right above the search bar said, ""Enter a name here."" Monty knew there weren't any Google records for himself, so he put in the next most obvious thing he knew: ""Danny Worsnop""

Suddenly a wave of text started appearing on the screen. He thought, ""Eh just another Google client, nothing new"" Suddenly an error message appeared saying, ""You have the biggest innovation the world has ever seen in your hands, *Monty.* Don't waste it this time"" He just disregarded it and clicked ""Okay."" However it did make him curious so he typed in the name of his bully, ""Christopher Jones"" Another wave of text appeared, possibly as big as the one for Danny Worsnop. He read it a little more.

* ""Oh god how I want to beat up Monty""
* ""Monty will be in the hospital by the end of the week if I can help it""

Although he worried about it as well, Monty murmured ""what the actual heck is this."" He decided to look us his brother's name, who was watching the Loud House in the background, and to his surprise the transcript of an episode of the Loud House was coming up, as if it was a magical livetweeting thing, but then another error message popped up. ""Enjoy reading everyone's mind""

""Oh my god"" said Monty. He woke up his baby sister but he was just that surprised. He read people's thoughts for three weeks, and even discovered that his crush from his summer behavior program last year likes him back! Suddenly at the end of the three weeks, Monty had an epiphany. ""What if I put in my own name?"" And so he did just that, and instead of his thoughts, ""No results found"".

""Eh?""

He put in the search box, ""Why can't I put in my name?"" The program spit up a message box saying ""You like Asking Alexandria, no?"" Monty realized he was about to have a conversation with ""iAmAwake.exe"" and so he typed ""Uh yeah?""

""Was that relevant?""

""No not really""

""Ding ding ding. Anyways, I feel like there's something you should rethink.""

""Like what?""

""Think back to your recent actions""

""Uh what?""

""Lighten up, your life will be better""

""How does this work?"" Suddenly all the pirated Asking Alexandria songs were gone from his desktop. ""Okay man, what gives?!""

""See what I mean?""

""You mean my music? Cause I ain't about to give up my precious Asking Alexandria!""

""No, but your emotional actions. You tend to get really mad when things screw up."" The music files were back

""What do you mean?!""

""Calm down""

""Make me!""

""Lighten yourself""

""Oooooh I see where you're going. I'll sure try"" Monty suddenly felt a light in him that was making him happier. It looked brighter outside his house, despite it still being 3:30 in the morning.

""Do or do not; there is no try""

""Mr. iAmAwake, I really like where this is going"" Suddenly there was a knock at his door. He opened and it was himself from yesterday. He was wearing a Bring Me The Horizon shirt and was practicing death metal screams. ""Ummmm was this really me?""

""Yes it's me, what do you think?""

""I don't know."" Suddenly iAmAwake spit out a final message box.

""You can't see your own thoughts... because you were unhappy. It wasn't your music; it was your general mood.""

Feelings start flooding into my heart, like my hatred for my foster mom. The excitement for my 13th birthday. I suddenly forgot how to hack like I have been. I'm reliving my life from June 29, 2016.

I was watching a new video from RebelTaxi about a month or so ago, *Top 5 Modern Cartoons I Haven't Reviewed Yet. (volume 1)* In the video he mentioned Star vs the Forces of Evil *[FORESHADOWING]* and I brushed it off like ""this is on my low-priority bucket list."" I started to see it around more and more until I was eventually like ""screw it I'm going ahead."" I watched the pilot and thought it was good, so I watched, well, the rest of the season.

By now I'm obsessed with this show. Something inside my brain is going crazy. I realize I formed a crush on Star, which is alright with me because for the past year I had been hung up over a girl I'm never gonna see again. I wait and wait for the season 2 premiere and it comes on, by now I'm almost tripping on having a crush. (if that's even a thing)

The feeling sucks, especially since I don't see any canonical reasons Starco should be a thing. I mean, they each have their individual crushes and it would likely be awkward for both of their parents.
