Autoattacks have their own timer (based on weapon speed), and changing them to abilities means they have a global cooldown. 

That means you now have a 1.8s cd on debuffs, but also shared with your abilities. It would be a severe nerf to them. Since they operate on different timers you can auto/debuff at the same time as using an ability for no dps loss. Also, with dw mage your autos go off every 1.2s, so 1.8s cd would be its own penalty there.

Based on my limited knowledge of the behind-the-scenes of the combat system, I don't think you can ""force"" an autoattack; an autoattack happens on a timer when not casting abilities and also having a target.

46,"We want utility, profit, and simplicity.

The untradeable portion of the pitch seems good; a consumable upgrade that requires high smithing and gives armor more strength/armor/damage reduction (which it desperately needs anyway) is useful, profitable, and simple.

The new ""smithable-only"" t60/70/80 gear will be dead content, and I disagree that t80 gear is irrelevant; Nex and Anima armor are both pieces of content that any level PvMer can enjoy and make good profit at. This idea is simple, but not useful or profitable.

In order to combat the dead on arrival armor, all the new armors t60-80 and also t90 should follow the artifact method; bosses/mobs drop the armor pieces and smithing adds a kit or ornamentation to make it usable and/or better. 

It might be punishing to say the best armor you can wear yourself as a drop-only is rune, therefore I suggest the ornamentation adds 0-5 levels onto the base level of the ""smithed-artifact"" gear. 

In practice, the 0th level can simply be the upgrade to the artifact armor that allows future improvement: for example, level 70 smithing is required to add on a barrows kit which allows ornamentation. This ornamentation can fill out the respective levels in between smithing tiers (e.g. 72 smithing = +2 levels ornament, 74 = +3 levels ornament, 76 = +4 levels ornament, 78 = +5 levels ornament).

This is useful because it improves existing armor while also giving smithing a purpose. This is not inherently profitable, but it does avoid loss of profit due to competition (t70/80 smithable vs t70/80 drops). This is simple in that it leaves drops unchanged and that every 2 levels is an improvement to your armor. ",2016-11-02 19:50:28+00:00,d9itti6,1.0,t3_5aq1a0,20859.0,runescape

* Band/Arma give you an unknown chance at have abilities' with cd over 30s reduced by 15% (9s for 1 minute and 4.5s for 30s)

Tuska is far outclassed by power armor, sara/zam are far outclassed by tank armor (by a single piece! including gloves or boots), and band/arma are just generally considered bad as they increase your dps by basically nothing.

Another con this analysis doesn't include is the fact you need all 3 pieces for the chosen set effect to even exist. Which means it's useless for slayer, the major piece of content this set could be argued for.

Further, Sara/Zam effect negates a useful perk (lucky) and Tuska negates a bis perk (biting) while being itself being negated by the cheap alternative to biting, equilibrium.

If all three set effects were active at once, didn't affect any perks, and hybrid had no defence level penalty, then Sliske armor might start to approach a viable state.


Note for the band/arma wp:

Assuming a 1% proc rate per piece, we'd see it proc around 12.6 times an hour, saving you an average of around 65 seconds in cooldowns per hour. However, the only dps gain is when you run out of strong (threshold) abilities or for a damage-boosting ultimate. At 60 damage-boosting ultimates an hour, you'd proc on 1.8 of them.

149,"&gt; Fantastic, and what's enabling that harm further?

This argument can be used to justify so many intrusive and ridiculous things. 

In game: Why let players communicate any other way than through quick chat? ""You're enabling verbal harassment!""

Real world: us needing a cop in every household. ""Not having a cop means we're enabling people to commit domestic abuse!""

Just have people responsible for their actions and viola, there's no problem. It's a bad argument.

&gt;So what? By far people use revolution

Because you were bolstering your argument by saying a lot of people use it. A lot more don't. It's simply a relevant counterpoint.

&gt;&gt;How so?

&gt;Some people don't want to be harassed about their gear. 

They will be harassed about something else if their attacked is intent on harassing them; alternatively, use the ignore list

&gt;Some people want to make their stats less easily checkable 

This isn't actually a reason, people want their stats *hidden* which is impossible due to the alternatives

&gt;Some people just want to be left alone, 

Turn your private to friends-only, public to friends-only, don't join a clan or fc; use the ignore list

&gt;some people don't like being spied on, 

Don't play rs I guess?

&gt;some people think it detracts from the social aspect when instead of asking for someone's level you just examine them.

Don't have examine toggled on

&gt;We've already done that.

Yes, it's called retrospect and I'm using it theoretically to look back on your solution if it was implemented.

&gt;More effort does not mean hamfisted,

No, but going back and undoing its only use aside from the very minor  slayer-and-bankstanding use piece by piece is.

&gt; so I don't care about the collateral

The problem is that there is no collateral. Yes people with private on will now be off--but this does no harm. No one is worse off by this and any reason to keep it can be mitigated completely with what we had prior to examines",2016-09-29 18:34:08+00:00,d878ks9,8.0,t1_d877jor,1310.0,runescape

152,"&gt; Why? Why do you care if someone else is wearing shit gear?

Because I don't want people with shit gear on my team.

&gt; Having examine optionally private doesn't hurt anyone. 

Someone having it on private does, it imposes costs on whomever is doing the examine (and also possibly costs on the person with the hidden examine).

&gt;Many players in OSRS probably do get others on their case for using shit gear.

So it's other players doing the harm.

&gt;Some people want it... etc

So the only use that doesn't have an alternative is preventing people from being harassed for gear while bankstanding or slayer (and of course if someone is intent on harassing someone they'd just choose another topic other than gear).

&gt;used by a ton of people 

By far most examines are public

&gt;can be addressed without detracting

As can every example you gave

&gt; outright removing it and fucking over

That's a little dramatic

&gt; This suggestion hurts people it doesn't need to hurt more than they need to be hurt without getting any more benefit for the people that it benefits compared to a more well thought out and delicate plan.

It doesn't hurt anyone and removes unnecessary cost in the form of less annoyance, less time wasted, and less effort.

implementing an option to hide your gear in a game with overrides and then piecemeal going back through the entire game to find relevant content and having it automatically disable anyway.

2) Totally incompetent but consider themselves highly skilled, attack other people for their lack of skill; when they make a mistake they are quick to pass the blame or make an excuse, and also disregard any advice or constructive criticism (most elitists)

Drop tables that I know of are not simply 1/x for a drop (except for boss pets). There are sub drop tables that influence the effective drop rates.

This would make the effective drop rate for an Elysian or Divine 1/4096, and the drop rate for Spectral or Arcane 1/1366. Not exactly a number anyone programmed.

Yes, but they've also said it will be less profitable, and that that's okay. 

""We're not going to do GP to GP replacements, monsters that drop smithing supplies will likely see their average drops go down.""

&gt;All of PVM isn't suddenly going to be shit GP/hour just because of this. Even if they literally replaced none of it, and they are going to replace it.

I didn't say it would be. But to your point, it would absolutely destroy PvM and slayer if they simply removed those drops.

399,"Of course it's as easy to farm. In fact, for anyone semi-competent at PvM it's by far the easiest to farm out of all things that drop t90 besides legiones. The context of this discussion has been high-level PvM, so QBD isn't worth mentioning. Though, QBD is also about 3.5x more gp/h than Telos, currently.

The example I gave is resetting using a pheromone (costs 2.1m) at 40% enrage. Which is ludicrous (purposefully so), but yet still about 50% more profitable than Telos if you assume the same kills per hour. The fact you have to use a pheromone does not mean ""only a certain number of people can keep farming long term"". It just means the price might go up. It might not, too.

My numbers are fairly accurate based on the limited information we have. The median common drop for Telos below 100 enrage is about 300-350k. Even the above average player isn't getting at least 12+ kills/h which would be required to get a net profit of 4m/h.

Times will improve, sure. Not significantly, though. On release Araxxor was 8-10 minute kills for most people, now you can get 4-5 with ease. 3.5 or less in a duo. People can already do near max deeps on P1-3, Telos' mechanics are time-gated on p4 and somewhat on p5. It's nothing like Araxxor where you can stall special attacks or do more dps to avoid them.

Further, I didn't say anything about 100+ enrage as we know near nothing about how much improvement we get from killstreaks and higher enrage for rare drops.

Secondly, (more speculation) he was thought to have used corporeal components, and a lot of them. Those too give massive xp drops, but are very expensive.

I bought 500 cannons and 2000 pieces of gano without leaking the gp/xp or xp/h. So you're wrong there.

Further, ON STREAM iTrolledU and Omid each bought thousands of cannons and gano items by asking their viewers to buy them for them. They paid 3 gp/xp. By this time, Scuzzy and le me had 20m+ xp.

25-50 gp/xp isn't cheap. Not on release, not ever. I'm not arguing for you, because 2-3 gp/xp was pre-double-nerf and before everyone found out. Once it was known, it shot up to 10-15 gp/xp in the first several hours; that's fairly cheap for a new skill. After the first nerf, prices continued to rise and with halved xp it was somewhere around 25-50 gp/xp. The second nerf put it at 50-100 gp/xp.

So no, they didn't need a second nerf, at all. The skill is completely broken. If you think 25-50 gp/xp is cheap, what do you make of semi-afk combat where you get some money back and charms and combat xp for as little as 4-5 gp/xp (1-2 right when the update happened).

But now we've reversed, gizmos are not a viable training method and combat is the way to go. The item sink portion of the skill is mostly gone, and it costs 1-2 gp/xp to train.

If you can disasemble 3k ""stacks""/h, it'd have to have an appropriate junk chance and a disassemble size large enough so that you could only get 2-4. 

It's not exactly straightforward how to do this. You have to account for how fast the items come into the game to make them appropriately balanced. 

With morcellas for example, it might be fairly easy because (I think) the only way to get them is via farming. The max you can get is 36/4h from farming.

4. 3k spring: 13.1k-3k - 0 = 10.1k

5. 7k spring:
13.1k-7k-0= 6.1k

As you can see, if it wasn't worth using the spring cleaner at 7k springs, the net profit for (2) under the assumption you would pick it up would either be 0 (break even) or negative.

* Full Break down: 13.1k

* High Alch: 4.8k

* Nature rune: .3k

Gross profit – accounting cost – economic cost = net profit

Using that formula, here are the respective profits of each method:

Assuming you would pick up:

1.  3k spring: 13.1k-3k-(4.8k-.3k) = 5.2k

2.  7k spring: 13.1k-7k-(4.8k-.3k) = 1.2k

3. Alch: 4.8k-.3k - 4k [selling to ge] = .5k

Assuming you wouldn’t pick up:

4. 3k spring: 13.1k-3k - 0 = 10.1k

5. 7k spring:
13.1k-7k-0= 6.1k

As you can see, if it wasn't worth using the spring cleaner at 7k springs, the net profit for (2) under the assumption you would pick it up would either be 0 (break even) or negative.

&gt;you always get the best offer because it's to simulate an actual marketplace. if you see two people selling for different prices, you'd always go with the lower one

That completely misses my point. The ""best offer"" is entirely dependent on whether you're the buyer or seller. One seller at 5k, one buyer at 10k. What's the ""best offer""? The seller wants the ""best offer"" of 10k, and the buyer wants the ""best offer"" of 5k. 

Look up what a spread is, what limit buys are and what limit sells are for starters. Then maybe look into market making. The GE is functionally no different than any other price matching engine (aka stock markets).

&gt;also it gives the best deal to the person instant selling or buying, it doesn't favor the buyer. slow offers will always be filled at the asking price.

If there are two people, one selling at 5k and I'm buying at 10k, and the GE price matches me to buy at 5k instead of selling it to me for 10k every single time, of course it's favoring the buyer because I get it 5k cheaper. It could just as easily favor the seller and sell it to me for 10k; or it could match us in the middle at 7.5k--or any number of things really, as long as it sells for 5k or more and buys for 10k or less.
