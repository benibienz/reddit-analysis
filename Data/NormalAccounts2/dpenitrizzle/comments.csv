527,"I have an idea for an action comedy or it could even be a parody, but that aside here is my basic outline: 

Imagine the world in the movie as it is in our world. America is settling down from a major war that was going on for the past several years. Just when the Government thought things were going  to be peaceful again, a new threat emerges. This media has painted this new terrorist threat as a the new biggest world threat. However, there is something different about this terrorist: he carries himself like an action movie villain. He has the personality of someone like Hans Gruber, he has a personal army of henchman, and he's been able to pull off these heists and various acts of terrorism. The Government has figured out that in order to take this ""movie villain"" on, they need help from an unexpected source: Hollywood's biggest action star, John Smith Wesson. The Government brings him in and of course John can't believe this is happening. Obviously, he has no experience in this and movies are fiction. Just when John thinks things couldn't get weirder, he's forced to team up with a rival promising action hero, Burt McClane. Burt is an upcoming, young hotshot action hero who is cocky, but lovable at the same time, hence his popularity. So, forcing to put their differences aside, they are tasked with taking down the terrorist threat. With the climactic encounter with the villain, they learn that the terrorist was a young, upcoming actor who disappeared off the grid because Hollywood only wanted to cast him as villains after giving an Oscar winning performance as a villain. They learn that the actor took on the identity of that villain and completely went off the rails. Essentially, he went crazy and felt that if the world wanted a villain, they got one. His plan was to basically take over the world and make the world worship him like a God. Of course, Burt and John take him down and the villain pays for what he did. John and Burt have become a little bit better friends and decide that they like being real life heroes and decide to quit acting and become Federal Agents. 

Now for casting:

John Smith Wesson: The Rock

Burt McClane: A choice between Chris Pratt or if Burt is an older character, Terry Crews.

Villain (Sorry haven't thought of a good villain name): Leonardo DiCaprio or the actor who played the bad guy from Karate Kid.

President of the USA: I'm thinking of some fun meta-type casting like Schwarzenegger, Harrison Ford, to name a couple.

So, there is my basic overall idea. What do you think? Feel free to give me any suggestions/imporvements.",2016-03-18 20:00:57+00:00,d14wxit,1.0,t3_4aymjd,18421.0,movies
