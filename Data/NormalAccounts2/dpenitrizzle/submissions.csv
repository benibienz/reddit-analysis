My idea is that the Turtles go into space to hunt down Krang. They find out that they are set up by Krang himself. He then initiates his Earth invasion plan with his alien army. The turtles have no way to get back, thanks to Krang. This is when the Turtles go to the Triceratons. They have always had their differences, therefore the Triceratons challenge the Turtles in order to prove themselves. After all is said and done, the Triceratons agree to help the turtles fight Krang and his alien army. The Turtles, with the help of the Triceratons, are able to go back to earth and fight off the alien invasion. Of course, the Turtles defeat Krang and his army and the Triceratons then go back to Dimension X, where Krang will face punishment for what he tried to do.
