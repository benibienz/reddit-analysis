21,"If anyone is still inclined to help, here's where I'm at now.

I managed to root the phone and installed a custom ROM (Android Revolution). After installing it, it of course stayed stuck on Starting Apps again. So I waited for it to shut down, rebooted in the bootloader, selected fastboot and reboot and BAM, that magically allowed the phone to boot up properly, where it asked me to set up the phone, etc. Before I got too far, I shut the phone down and restarted it and now I'm stuck at the HTC One logo, which is precisely where all of this began. 

Does this sound like it could be a hardware issue to anyone, because it sure is starting to sound like one to me!

Any help is greatly appreciated :)",2016-03-30 21:46:55+00:00,d1jn0kc,1.0,t3_4cayme,190808.0,htcone
