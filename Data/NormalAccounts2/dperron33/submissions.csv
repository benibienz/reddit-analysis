I've been having major issues with my HTC One M8 for the last couple of days and I'm hoping to just get it to reboot at this time. It has never been modded and always worked well, up until Friday or so.

So the first thing that happened is that it froze at the HTC One screen while booting up. I was unable to shut it down by holding the power button and so had to wait for the battery to die. Ever since then, it hasn't been able to reboot at all. I tried to plug it in for hours to let it charge but it seems it never got past 4% charge even after 3 hours of being plugged directly into the wall. It doesn't get recognized when I plug it into my PC. Here is all that I tried to get it to work:

- I am able to boot to the bootloader using Power and Volume Down. From there, I tried every option, without success.
- I tried launching Recovery but I never get to that menu. I get the red exclamation mark icon for a couple of minutes and then the phone just shuts down. 
- I tried a factory reset but I get a combination of 1- freezing at the HTC One menu as it reboots, 2- the phone just shutting down a minute or so after starting the process or 3- once I even got all the way to ""Android is Starting - Starting Apps"" but it froze on that screen for hours before I gave up and unplugged it so it would eventually die and shut down.

Trying new steps always takes time because I have to unplug the phone and wait for it to die as my only way to force it to reboot. 

Does anyone have any suggestions before I give up entirely?

Thanks!

Update 1: I've followed the steps and have been able to get to the screen to unlock the bootloader. I said 'Yes' and my phone has now begun the ""Android is Starting .. Optimizing app xx of 166""
I guess we'll see if it goes further than the Starting Apps point that I've reached before.
Can I still attempt to root at at this point?

Update 2: Still stuck at ""Android is Starting .. Starting apps"". 

Update 3: Sigh. I've now managed to get the RUU to recognize my phone and start the restore process, but it fails pretty much right away, saying to get the correct ROM utility and try again

Update 4: I somehow was able to get it working again. BUT I then attempted a reboot and AGAIN it's stuck at ""Android is Starting .. Starting apps"".

So I'm a self-taught (which is to say I'm doing it by the seat of my pants, mostly) singer in a rock band and I'm noticing that usually at about the 1.5 hour mark of our rehearsals, my voice is fatigued and I can no longer hit the notes on the higher end of my register. 

I know how to breathe through my diaphragm but that is almost everything I know in terms of technique. Is there something I'm doing wrong that's causing my voice to basically give out after 90 minutes, or is that something that is to be expected and that can be worked through?
