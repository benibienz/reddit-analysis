Also, you kind of helped explain my idea on Obi Wan in the episode 4. Obi Wan force powers are not as strong as they were, thus being taken out by Vader who isn't exactly jumping around like he used to. I think being away from active force users has stopped his midi from communicating and growing and they have become dormant.

364,"Alright, your post got me and though I know this will raise some questions and scepticism , but I can ""dispel"" or ""vanquish"" ghosts and in 2 cases , dangerous ghosts. 

I found out about 10 years back when my aunt (who is/was heavy into Santeria) did a lineage search of some sort and came up that we are from a Inca people. The area that it was supposedly traced to has legends that people of that area were used as witch doctors and demon ""hunters"". My aunt was the really the first person I ever confessed to seeing ghosts and spirits and she said that it is normal for people in our family to see them. I guess that background is my explanation as to why I see/feel them. 

To explain how I dispelled a dangerous ghost, there was ""something"" that was attached to my wife when we first started dating. She was always sick and tired. One night, after sex we were lying down when I saw this thing hovering around her. It noticed me and it seemed to want to vanish or retreat back into her. Well I grabbed her, put her in the tub and yelled at this thing to leave. I poured water and instinctively put my hand over her, where I saw it go in. I felt the energy from my hand grab something, like how it feels when you hold a magnet to another magnet. After I ""pulled"" it out my wife said she actually felt something leave. She felt ""lighter"".  I should mention the whole time my wife was half asleep and as much as I tried to get her to be coherent , she just mumbled.  It's okay if you don't believe me,  I wouldn't believer it if someone else told me it. ",2016-06-02 06:56:55+00:00,d3stcws,1,t3_4m2h8n,47742,Paranormal

Americans need to start getting outraged. They need to now sow the seeds of real change not just for themselves, but for future generations. The DNC is treating it's supporters like garbage.

It doesn't take a person with a Ph.D in politics to realize that the best way to keep things in your favour is to be the person making the rules. The rich stay rich by feeding off the poor and middle class. I personally believe that these 2 candidates don't see the American people as people, but rather as a stat for profits. The way Sanders presents himself is one of a man with ideals and ideas to change things for the better for the people and that's the main difference I believe. Sanders see's his supporters as people, people with aspirations , dreams and more importantly , people tired of being held back by a socioeconomic system that will keep them from ever achieving their dreams of being self sufficient. 

The last thing I want to add is to those who say that Sanders plan will take all their money I say ""what money""? Unless you are making over $90K a year, which from the latest stats most Americans are not , then they will benefit from all the social services he is proposing.

What I think is happening is that Giggs who has only had exp as a coach was under Fergie goes back to doing things the Fergy way, or rather coaches to it. So when LVG says do this and change this up , the players are sort of scattered as their practices are not 100% reflecting the direction LVG wants.

At some point this season Bran is going to be able to walk again.

This will not only be a huge for moment for him, but also for the old man because now he knows Bran could influence the past. This also kind of works because he said he would not be there forever and whatever better way to leave then walk out. ",2016-05-09 02:32:43+00:00,d2y5aav,1,t3_4ihi7c,1784,asoiaf

What I can tell you is that after watching the Dwayne Wade video of him still shooting during the Canadian National Anthem is simply deplorable and 100% unacceptable. The NBA as a whole should hand down either a big fine or suspension for the rest of the series. This so not to give Toronto an advantage but rather to set a precedence that this type of behaviour is not acceptable. This is a paid professional athlete, not some thug from the street. He should behave like one.  

Let's be realistic. There are many cases of fans booing national anthems in all sports, it happens. The issue is when a professional and well known person such as Wade does a very public boner like this, it makes him and the league look bad. ",2016-05-08 20:18:58+00:00,d2xs5oj,1,t3_4ifqay,6134,nba

They go back and save her from Dahrk, but that would be to much recon. Having Laurel back, to me is a step in the right direction. 

As for the letter from future Ollie, the letter would be him telling his younger self that being with Felicity distracts them to much from their jobs and ultimately leads to his shitty future where Felicity is gone anyways. I agree that the Felicity character would not want to hear it unless it was unbelievable heart wrenching, like a video message from future Felicity. The message wouldn't be from future Felicity to younger Felicity, rather a video message she left for old man Ollie that he includes in past message to show Felicity because he knows Felicity will try to stop him.

586,"Hey OP. I don't know if I can help you, but I will tell you what we as a family did to dispel the demon following one of my uncles.

**First and foremost, do not show fear.** Fear is the weakness that these demons use to manipulate you. You have to show that you know it can not hurt you. Yell it out loud that you know it's there and that your not afraid. 

Carry around salt with you. Take some salt, put in small biles and be ready to sprinkle it when you feel its presence. Put it in the corners around the room. 

If the demon is saying it is going to kidnap you , it is just trying to make you afraid. Again, it's through fear that these things get you. It can not kidnap. If it trying to posses you (which by the the way you describe by how it is talking to you in your dreams) it will only be able to when you are at your weakest.  

If things should escalate. Seek help from a catholic priest. Yes it might sound cliche, but they know better then anyone on how to rid demons.

590,"Hey. Really appreciate the well thought out response. 

As I had mentioned, this was a second hand story. I went by what my uncle told us about what happened in the fridge and noises he heard. The conversation I had with my folks about this and what I remember about that story that night. 

I agree with you that the memory is a tricky thing, but the events that happened to him were pretty engraved in his mind. He's been telling this story for over 15 years and not once does it become more exaggerated. 

Honestly,I have other stories that have happened to me alone, but I don't share them for that very reason. I prefer to tell stories that have multiple people,all saying pretty much the same thing. For example, when I asked my folks about the basement story, my dad said basement while my mom said the voices came from the locked wine cellar. Point is that they both agree what happened.

620,"Here is one I shared about a year ago


My parents were night cleaners for the keg restaurant in Toronto. As sometimes, they needed extra help they brought along my uncle who would normally have just baby sat me. (I was 10 years old). He also brought over his gf,  who I would mainly just hang out with while the rest of them went to work. One night, my uncles gf and I were playing cards on one of the booths and fell asleep. Well, we were woken up my uncle screaming telling us we have to go to the basement and hurry to follow him. We both wake up and start following him, but I seems to be very far ahead. When I turn the corner, I bump into my uncle and ask where the basement and what's the emergency. He responded with telling me was following my mother and father, who yelled at him from the across the room to get to the basement. Standing there puzzled, we catch up to my uncles gf who had bumped into my parents. They said that they heard mine and my uncles' gf voice from the basement and my father had gone to get the spare keys because it was locked. It seemed like something was trying to lure us into the basement.

What I did was take out a loan with a 2nd party lender at fucking 38% interest to pay off and consolidate my debt. Then after I got a guaranteed credit with a limit of $200(my credit was shit btw) 

After that don't miss any payments, make sure you pay your cell phone and other utility's that report to credit agencies on time.

Chelsea : a new manager. Yes the mourinho bantar is fun, but it really does look like he's lost the locker room. A team that has such high level talent needs a manager to breath new life into them and get the team to gel and work together, like what Klopp is doing  for liverpool. 

Liverpool; a new keeper. Minglot is great, but he is to prone to errors and stupid mistakes. On top of that , he seems to reply doubt himself at times and his defense and it shows. 

Man U. ; A decent midfielder. I always felt that them losing Di Maria would hurt them. Maybe also look into trading Rooney and bank on his name and get either good coin for him, or use him as a bargaining chip for another younger top level player. A stupid crazy option would be to callback Falcao. Maybe this time around he can change.  

Man city. No idea. Man city are a pretty but injury prone team at times. 

Arsenal: Speaking of injuries  see if Jesus is back and hire him as a physio. Really, arsenal at 100% is very scary.

*...1...2...3...4*
*...4...3...2...1*
*Deep breath*

I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. 

Where am I? Who's car is this? Where did this money in hand come from. Was I just dreaming?  I know where I am. I remember now, I left the kids at my families old farm house. Jason wet the bed and Samantha forget her favorite plush pokemon ,  Mr. Pots. I remember her calling Pots Pots, please Mr Pots. She really loves that pokemon  and Jason is really embarrassed about wetting the bed. I'm a good dad. 

*Ring* *Ring* 

That's not my text alert.  Where is my phone? What is it doing beside Pots. I think Pots is broken, it keeps talking, it must be broken. I have to pull over to take out his batteries and it will also give me a chance to check who text me. 

Good , Pots is quiet now. Shhhh. Finally some quiet. Hmm. Who text me? I don't recognize this number. Who is hannah  ?  No matter ,I better text her she has the wrong number. What's wrong with my phone ,the stupid auto text isn't working , it keeps changing ""sorry wrong number"" to *""rebmun gnorw yrros""* whatever . I don't even like this phone anymore.  I better call ahead to tell them I'm almost there.  

Hello Nikki, it's me. I'll be home soon. I have the things for the kids.  Yes honey, it's me. I'm okay, I am just driving over to see the kids. Where am I exactly? I don't know, some dirt road. Why ? Are you worried? Honey,  did something happen , why are you crying ? I'll be home soon.  What? What do you mean you don't want me home?  It's my house , my kids. They need me. Hello. HELLO. FUCKING HELLLOOOO. What happened ? Why is she like this? They are my kids. My kids my kids my kids my kids.... breathe...breathe

I better text her. ""Honey. Why are you so mad? Let me see the kids."" (My text is working now)

*Ding* 

That took longer then I wanted,  she says she will come out to see me with the kids because she hasn't cooked and wants to have a meal. 
Come to think of it, I am pretty hungry. 
I text her back, ""okay. I'll meet you at the waffle shack of 7th and hwy 5. Our usual spot."" I know where I am now.  It'll only take me 5 mins. 

I get off the next exit and sure enough , there is the waffle shack.  I see through the door and their is a sign that says "" back in 15 mins "" no problem. It's weird though because I see the girl inside talking on the phone looking at me . She must be on her break.  Bad customer service. 

20 mins pass. She is still on the phone. I'm getting really upset. 25 mins. I knock on the window , she just looks at me scarred. Whatever, I'll just smile. 
30 min. She is making me really upset. I feel out of breath. I need to could 

*1...2...3...4*

Huh. How silly of me, the other door was open.  I think she proably thought I was trying to vandalize the door. Poor girl. Oh well. I take a seat and start looking at the menu.  Where is the waitress, I just saw her. I heard her say her name , what was it again, something weird like onon,  must be her nickname.

Where is Sarah, why are her and the kids not here? I am so mad right now.  I am going to text her 

*""Dammit, I'm mad""*

Suddenly. I see the police lights all around the diner.  What happened ? Well before I can get a second thought in I hear the window break and the front door broke down.  The police are yelling some non sense. I can only make out ""Put it up"" I'm a so scarred and stressed right now. Breathe ...breathe 

*4...3...2...1*

*1...2...3...4*

1156,"Hurray,  story time.  

Back in my teenage days, during the early days of the Internet I started talking to some girl on icq.(yeah icq, Google it young redditors ) 

She kept sending all these pics of ""herself"" and kept telling me that we should meet up and go drinking. I wasn't 19 yet, so I snuck into my folks liqueur cabinet and stole some pisco. We agreed to meet 3 town over in a restaurant. She told me to wear a striped , black and white shirt so she knew it was me. 

Fast forward to the night. I put on the thickest layer of hair gel, put on my best  Fubu shirt, red tab jeans and half a bottle of Adidas moves Cologne. (90s). 

I arrive at the bar and take a seat by the door. I ordered a soda and just sat there for about 2 hours.  Every 5 mins I would check the door. No girl, just guy after guy kept coming in.  After about waiting about 3 hours,  I made an interesting observation. Half the bar was full of guys wearing black and white striped shirts.  All holding a backpack that most likely had a bottle of booze. I decided to call it a night and finally leave. 
That's it . That's my story .

A few years back,  I went camping with a few friends to a national park here in Canada. The 2nd night in,we are all sitting around a campfire getting ready to call it a night.  I being the most awake and less drunk volunteers to put out the fire. I grab my flashlight and I start my start my 5 min walk to get some sand at the nearby beach through a path in the woods. I grab a bucket of sand and this is where things get weird. On my way back, I hear some rustling in the nearby bushes , thinking it was a racoon or some other critter . What I saw was what looked like  a coyote walking on it's hinds legs with what looked like another coyote following it in a single line formation, turning towards me and making eye contact. Terrified , i immediately start thinking if I should run, make loud noises or crap my pants and accept my fate and at this point option 3 looks like the winner . After what felt like a lifetime , a loud animal cry I can't identify is heard. The 2 animals turn it's attention towards it, look back at me and I swear it looked like the **FUCKING THING NODDED IT'S HEAD** and then ran away on 2 hind legs. When I finally make it back to camp, i decide that I am not sleeping or putting out this fire.  One of my friends stumbles her way from her tent (she was drubk ) and asks me where I been and if I needed help putting out the fire. I told her what happened and she woke up her then bf.  Her bf called BS on me and said we would look into in the morning. He then said if I feel scared to sleep in the truck and proceed to grab the bucket and put out the fire.

1269,"Oh. Story time. 

A few years ago in my previous job,I had the unfortunate task of getting former employees laptops and cleaning them out. One particular day, I get a laptop from someone who was fired for an ""undisclosed  reason"" which usually meant porn browsing OR theft. After I reformatted this computer I booted it up and an auto play came up with files and pictures. I was little baffled as to what this was as I just reformatted the thing. I open it up and there is naked pics of the former employee his wife and then some pics of the guy and the secretary, some pics with the boss and secretary and one of him with just the boss doing what appeared was coke. At this point I looked at every USB port to find the source of the pics and finally realised it wasn't a USB,rather it was an SD Memory card that I didn't realize the lap top had a port for. I removed the SD CARD, put the a memo into my report that there are personal pics in that card and handed it off to my boss. 15 mins later I call from my boss asking him to see me. He starts asking me about the memory card and how much I saw. I told him I just saw thumbnails and that I realized it was a personal card and not company property. I don't think he bought it, but whatever I quit shortly after because it was so aukward and the pay sucked more dick then that dudes wife
