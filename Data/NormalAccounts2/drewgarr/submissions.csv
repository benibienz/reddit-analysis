I’ll get right to it, Rey will be the one to kill Jedi Master Luke Skywalker. I know that’s a bold claim, one I would not make without any proof other than fandom and speculation.

When we last saw Rey, she had been given the map and a ride to the first Jedi temple to meet Luke Skywalker. They meet atop a mountain and to Luke’s surprise; she offer’s him his fathers lightsaber. Details have emerged that in episode 8, Luke &amp; Rey will have a training scene supposedly to learn more about the force, similar to Yoda in ESB. Other than rumours, we the audience are under the assumption that this is her reason for going. The same reason Leia lets Rey use the map and the Falcon with Chewie. She must trust Rey.

In their training session, Rey’s will ask Luke about her parents and her time on Jakku. Initially Luke will deny knowing anything about her parents and reveal the secret of the jedi temple and possibly hint at the force tree, and teach Rey about the force.  Rey asks Luke to help her heal, revive the only other person she has left she cares for, Finn. Luke agrees to go back to rebel base and see Finn. Luke can not help.        (this almost seems like it would happen to fast, going back for Finn)

As the story progress’s and her powers grow, she &amp; Luke will be found by a now healed Kylo , possibly with the knights of Ren. In the ensuing battle, Rey and Luke will fight together and dispatch the KOR. Ren alone tells Luke and Rey that Snoke is on his way.  In the battle Ren takes down Luke because Luke is hesitant to fight his former padwan &amp; nephew. Ren, now more powerful due to more training with Snoke is able to over- power Rey, possibly mocking Luke that he will finish her like all his padwans, ala Vader. Luke finally jumps in to defend Rey. It is at this point that a continuation of Rey’s force vision is shown. We see more details regarding her past, including a scene revealing that Luke is directly involved in her being left on Jakku. Meanwhile, Luke &amp; Kylo fighting , Luke tells him Snoke is clouding him, using him and he will throw him away, similar to what Han says. That brief lack of concentration lets Luke gain the upper hand.

Rey angry at Luke starts yelling at him, attacking him. Luke explains he had no choice that Snoke and KOR were looking for her. He needed to hide her. Rey furious blames Luke and suspects he killed her parents. Luke, already injured by his fight with Kylo &amp; KOR is defeated by Rey. It is at this point we get Snoke. Whether it’s a new or old character, we get snoke. Snoke tells Rey the truth, that it was Luke that killed her parents. That she can get them back under his teachings. As proof , Snoke heals the only other person left she cares about, Finn. He also tells her that he can bring back her parents (ala Palpatine) He tells her Luke could have all along but refused to. Luke tries to explain but in her anger, Rey kills him. Kylo seeing this is suddenly saddened of his uncle’s death. Snoke tells Rey to come with him, which she does, much to the protest of her friend Finn. When asked about Kylo, Snoke says to leave him for dead. After they leave, Kylo is picked up by his mother and rebels. Leia bringing her son home.

 

Before this is dismissed about as Fan Fiction give me one moment to provide some evidence to bring this from fan fic to fan theory.

Rey motives: Rey is sent to Luke to learn about her powers and the force. She is not sent to come back with Luke, or learn then fight for the resistance. Going to learn about her force powers is actually a big deal because after delivering BB-8, her first instinct is to go back to Jakku, refusing a job offer from Han Solo. This proves, in my opinion that Rey’s goal is her family, not the jedi and certainly not the resistance. The only other thing she would care for is her friendship with Finn, who she has promised to return to. Rey is also an angry, violent person with hate in her heart. Seeing that some of you are sharpening your knives to come after me for saying that, let me explain why. First. She attacks Finn on their first encounter, on the word of BB-8. Next she was ready to release gas on the falcon when she thought it was the first order, not Han &amp; Chewie. Next in a deleted scene, when confronted by Plutt, she pulls a gun on him when he wants to take her back to Jakku. She tells him to back off and when he refuses, out comes the gun.  There was no “ I am with Han"", or tell him she cant go back. In fact, she wants to go back to Jakku. Why not take the ride back and deal with Plutt now? Because she hates him and what does Yoda say about hate “hate is the path to the darkside”. Finally lets look at the final scene in TFA. After she defeats Kylo, she doesn’t turn off her saber. It wasn’t until Kylo moved that she started walking towards him, possibly to deliver the final blow. If it wasn’t for the ground splitting, the solo would have had to shop for 2 for 1 casket deals. As a quick note, Rey did not go for his hand or leg, no she went right for the head, showing an intention to kill. Kylo on the other hand was trying to talk to her, recruit her and teach her. So with the above, we can establish that Rey is angry, feels strong connection to her family and is willing to kill. Sound familiar? It should because I am talking about Anakin. It was these reasons that Palpatine was able to exploit Anakin and told him about using the force (not from a jedi) to bring back the dead. If it is confirmed that Luke had something to do with her parents disappearance or her being ditched in Jakku (which is not far fetched) then Snoke can exploit this and get her to kill Luke.

I want to discuss why Luke would refuse to initially fight Kylo. Kylo is Luke’s nephew and former padwan. Luke will try to explain that he does not need to be like Vader, that he can be better. He will explain that Vader was not his father, that Anakin was. He will tell him that Vader in the end was good and once he was free, he was able to return to the light. That the light he feels within him is his grandfather trying to reach out to him. To prove that this is the case let us quickly look at Kylo and why he is drawn to the light. In TFA, Kylo tells Snoke that with his guidance, he will not be tempted by the light. Jumping further, right before Kylo kills Han, Kylo almost does not go through with it. He tells him he is constantly feel like he is being ripped apart. To just go a bit further, Han Solo says “there is too much Vader in him”. Well if that’s the case, then there is possible redemption in his future. Afterall, when Vader learned Luke was his son, he offered him to rule together. Even fighting Luke in ESB, he was trying to subdue luke, not kill him. When Palpatine was killing Luke, vader threw him off the platform, saving Luke and killing palpatine. So saying there is too much Vader in him could be a form of foreshadowing. So it would take something major to make Luke fight him and that would be possibly losing Rey.

So there we have it; Rey will kill Luke. But why? This opens the door to Reys redembtion and take Rey out of that Mary Sue trope which Daisy herself has said Rey does not fit into. Also, JJ has mentioned that Rey’s force vision will be like an ongoing story into Rey’s past.

We first hear about it from QGJ as he tells a young Anakin that the higher concentration in one's body means they are more likely to yield more force powers (sensitivity). Going further on this, George Lucas describes Midi-Chlorians as microscopic living organisms that are in a symbiotic relationship with other cells within the host's body. He goes on to say that the act as a power source for the cells and the force. George takes it a step further and further describes them as all Medi_chlorians are being ""connected"". It seems he is implying there is a sort of psychic connections all Midi-Chlorians. Further he says that this is something that is known in the universe. 

By George Lucas own description of them, it sounds like he is referring to the real world cellular organisms known as mitochondria. A quick wiki tells us that Mitochondria derive from an ancient bacteria that has evolved and lives within our cells. They are also described as being a sort of power source for the cells they inhabit. It is also worth noting that mitochondria can not live in red blood cells (which is the majority of the cells in our bodies) but rather in other cells, such liver cells. So it is impossible for a person to be all mitochondria. If we apply the above logic to Midi-Chlorains, we can safely say that a being with more midi-chlorians would be more sensitive to the force and yield more force powers.

Now with the science lesson over I can come to my point, how does having a high concentration of Midi-Chlorians affect the lives of the different characters in the Star Wars universe and how do they interact with one another?

First off, I want to answer a very obvious question, if there these microscopic being's exist in all loving things, why are there not more being's using force abilities? The answer is simple and is provided by QGJ. In measuring Anakins Midi count, he tells Obi-Wan that his count rivals that of the strongest Jedi at the time, Master Yoda. This implies that there is a sort of scale in place that if someone has a certain amount, they qualify as a force user. Of course the count would have to be very high to qualify. 

Secondly I want to answer the question, why is it that force users like Luke and Rey become so skilled at using the force in short time? To answer this I have to go back to Anakin in  episode 1. QGJ senses that there is something special about the day, thus his interest in him and wanting to measure his count. If there is a psychic connection as described by Lucas regarding the Midi-Chlorains then I think its safe to say that what is happening is QGJ Midi is reacting to Anakins Midi, thus being drawn to one another. This alone does not answer why characters like Rey and Luke became so skilled in their force powers in such a short time. It is my theory that when someone who has a very high Midi-Chlorian count comes in contact with someone else of the same or higher count, they interact and become ""awaken"". This is scene in episode 1 where the QGJ comes in contact with young Anankin. Quigon senses the awakening in Anakin and tells him he has to listen to them. Anakin displays this sort of force perception during his pod race. Anakin use's the force to help guide him to victory. In short, QGJ presence awoke the dormant cells in Anakins body.

To further prove my point regarding this, I want to jump now to episode 4. Before we meet Obi-Wan, we meet Luke and he is your typical kid, living on a desert planet with dreams of more. It is not until his chance encounter with R2-D2 that he choose to seek out old Ben Kenobi, a local hermit in the hills of Tattoine. To not go to deep into the story, after their meeting Obi-Wan starts training Luke to use the force and even displays some force abilities for him to see. This to me is another example of a high count Midi-Chlorian carrier coming in contact with another high count carrier and awakening his cells. After Obi-Wan's death, Luke goes to train with the mega high count Medi-Chlorian being, Yoda. Being exposed to Yoda's cells further awakens his own and thus his giant increase in force powers and fighting abilities in such a short time. 

Lastly, I come to Rey. Same scenario, Rey is a scavenger living in a desert planet who's life is thrown upside down by a chance encounter with a droid. There is no argument that Rey is force sensitive but to what level is yet to be seen, however the above example's still apply to her. Now I am strong believer that Finn is a passive force user, sort of the same way as Leia. I believe that it is her encounter with Finn that jumped started her force power's and allowed her force guided intuition to pilot the Millennium Falcon out of harms way. There are arguments above Finn being force sensitive so I'll leave that point as a is for now. What I can prove is that her force powers did not awaken until later in the movie, in the scene where she is drawn to the light saber and has force visions. Before this she has not exhibited any such abilities. It is important to note that this ""awakening"" takes place after meeting another high count Medi-Chlorian carrier, Maz Kanata. It is proven that not only Maz is force sensitive, but also a force user. She of course would have a higher count then Finn (again open to interpretation) , thus awakening more of her dormant cells. To skip ahead, it is not until she is in the same room as Kylo Ren, a extremely high force user (meaning more medi in his system) that her abilities really awaken. Now she suddenly can do the Jedi mind trick, force jump and be skilled with the light saber. Enough to be able to go toe to toe with the best at that time, Kylo Ren.

Hopefully I have provided enough evidence to prove my point. Now if this is the case, how does this help the story? Well to me it helps answer a lot of questions and fill in some plot holes.

One such plot hole is how is it that characters like Luke and Rey get so good in such a short amount of time. The answer to me is that if the Medi-chlorian have a psychic connection, then they pass on their power and collective knowledge to the host. 

Another  question answered would be how was Leia able to find Luke in cloud city? Well as seen in episode 7, she felt the moment Han Solo was killed by Kylo Ren. I am under the belief that she did not feel the death of Han, but rather the tremendous emotional pain her won was in. Participating in patricide would do that to someone. So with this in mind, I believe she knew where Luke was because both of his physical and emotional pain acted as beacon to the nearest force user, which happen to be Leia. 

Lastly, it helps explain why other Jedi's feel the death of whole planets other Jedi's. If the Midi-Chlorians are all psyicly linked, then when suddenly a large number of them die so quickly, others being's who are connected to this psycic network are going to feel it. 

TL:DR Midi-Chlorains psychically link all force users and are activated when a host with a similar or higher count are in the presence of one another.

First and foremost , you will have to trade with someone that is at your same level. In game mechanics will not allow a level 4 trainer to have a 2300 CP Pokémon so trading your 356 CP Pidgy for my 2600 Dragonite just won't happen. 

Secondly , and this is just speculation but I think the legendary birds are going to be team specific (Zapdos for instinct only for example). The reason Niantic might do this is to encourage trading among people from different teams. Think of it as how Pokémon red and Pokémon blue both had colour specific Pokemon and the only way to acquire them was to trade with a friend who had the same game , but different version (colour). 

Lastly ,Trading will utilize the A/R camera. Niantic seems to have a hard on for utilizing this function of the game. The way I see working is like this. The trade update will create a QR type barcode that will load the trainers level and Profile. In the Pokémon menu , there will be a ""Trade"" option in the same menu as apprise and transfer. After pushing trade it will prompt you to turn on the camera and scan the person your trading with QR code. After scanning the code the other person will then be promoted to choose a Pokemon they want to trade it for. The game will then determine if the trade meets the criteria (trainer level, IV's etc) eligible for the trade to be completed. Of course both players will have to hit accept and there will probably be a 30 sec of 1 min time out. 

The method I mentioned above will probably be a way to keep the trading localized and not having people auction their Pokémon online.

22,2016-10-13 21:33:55+00:00,self.FanTheories,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/57ctk7/star_wars_a_far_fetched_theory_on_snokes_identity/,False,"Snoke. The name that has been boggling Star Wars fans and spellcheck programs for over a year now and since then fans from all over the world have been asking questions about him. Who is Snoke? How is he connected to the skywalkers? [Is he tired of motherfucking snakes on his motherfucking base?] (http://www.scified.com/news/star-wars-fan-theory-suggests-snoke-is-actually-mace-windu-with-supporting-evidence)

Hands down the most frequently debated topic around Snoke is as to his true identity. Some theories have him slated to be a reincarnated Darth Plagus, reincarnated Darth Vader, Mace Windu, Emporer Palpatine, Jar Jar fucking Bings and so on. Hell for all we know he could be a force sensitive, sentient Rancor out for revenge against Luke for what he did to his father in episode 6.

Well, I would propose a new candidate for the identity of Snoke. Fanboys I beg, please listen to everything I have to say before you decide to hunt me down and do to me what Han did to that in episode 5 to keep Luke warm. My theory is that Snoke is [Maz Kanata] (http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Maz_Kanata)

Let’s look at some facts. As per episode 7, Snoke is revealed to have seen the rise and fall of the Galactic empire.This places him to be alive and kicking before the events of episode 1, so he must be old as fuck. Know who else is old as fuck? Maz Kanata. In fact, Maz says something almost identical to what Snoke said. “Through the ages…I’ve seen evil take many forms. The Sith. The Empire. Today, it is the First Order. Their shadow is spreading across the galaxy. We must face them. Fight them. All of us.” With this line, we can establish that not only she has been present for much of the rise and fall of the empire, but she has taken an interest in it over the years. Another similarity between the both of them is that they are both force sensitive. As per the wookieepedia entries for both Snoke &amp; Maz, they are both force sensitive. Not only is she a force sensitive, but also a force user. In a deleted scene, the VFX supervisors talk about a [scene (about the 1:05 mark)  where] (https://youtu.be/FebQPoMhZ2o) Maz uses the force to bring down the roof on attacking stormtroopers. With this bit of information we can confirm she is more powerful then she appears. We also know she is not a Jedi because she says so herself.  So we can now conclude that both Snoke &amp; Maz are old ass force user’s and the only real solid clue to Snoke’s identity is that he is old. I mean the only other character that fits this description is [Yoda] (https://m.popkey.co/414f64/bgl4r.gif) and he is too busy being dead.

Okay, so we have age and force powers in common, big deal that does not prove anything. Well, allow me to bring up a few more points before some of you decide to through me to the Rancor pit. Let’s talk about the light saber, more specifically the blue light saber. I am going somewhere with this.

When we last saw this infamous lightsaber, it was falling down some hole in Cloud City at the end of episode 5 after Darth Vader revealed he is Luke’s father and cut off his hand. Side note, if that was a spoiler for you, fuck you. Go back to shooting wamp rats and moisture farming. The question that has been raised is how did Maz acquire the lightsaber? The most obvious  answer is that she acquired it from her time being a smuggler. [She is nicknamed the pirate queen and is described as collecting trinkets which she considers valuable and stores them.] (http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Maz_Kanata) Now it is my theory that she was a fellow smuggler to Lando, she was in cloud city the same time everything went down. She being force sensitive was able to locate and find the light saber (hand may be included).

I think to say that Maz being a force user, knows the importance of a light saber and thus made the effort to keep it safe that is until Rey showed up. Now I will not dive into the actual light saber any further because I use to prove that Finn is force sensitive, rather I want to use the existence of the light saber to further prove my point. To me, one of the major plot holes in episode 7 was in the final battle between Kylo Ren and Finn , Kylo tells Finn “that light saber, it belongs to me”. To me, it seems that Kylo knew of the existence of the light saber. If you believe that, it begs the question ; who told Kylo about the blue light saber and that it was still around? To Luke, Leia &amp; Billy Dee (Lando), that lightsaber is long gone. Han has a functional relationship with Maz so why would she not say “Hey Han, you know your space wizard brother in law, is this his?” No, rather she kept it a secret. No one knew she had it and as far the story goes, Kylo and Maz have never met. The only person left to tell Kylo is Snoke. So unless Snoke and Maz have a line of communication, there is no other explanation.

Now let’s address the most obvious point against this theory, Maz wants to wipe out and fight against the first order. She talks about the sith in passing. Know what she fails to mention? The Knights of Ren. Supreme Hitler  Leader Snoke is in charge of the first order as well as the Knight’s of Ren. The Knights of Ren are 100% devoted to their cause and are considered to be part of the dark side of the force. This is just an assumption but it is entirely possible that Snoke is manuvering the first order to fight the rebels and as Maz is “guiding” the rebels to fight the first order. What is the end game? That eventually both destroy each other and herald the way for the K.O.R.
Now I come to my final point; the appearance. They do not look anything alike. For one Snoke has a [giant scar] (http://static.srcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/Star-Wars-Force-Awakens-Snoke-Leader.jpg) on his forehead and [Maz has no scar at all.] (https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3Mrw6l9YiB0/maxresdefault.jpg) Also, Maz is Donald Trump orange &amp; Snoke is as white as bread. Plus there is the size difference. Maz is Snoke to what Muggsy is to Shaq.

I will start by explaining the last 2 points with one simple word; hologram. We have seen very detailed spanning the wars movies, but one thing they have in common is they all have that[ ghostly white projection.] (star wars holograms) Even character’s of [color still show up like this.] (http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/msnbc/Components/Photos/050515/050515_starwarstech_hlg_3p.grid-6x2.jpg) The hologram would also explain the difference in size. Since we have not seen Snoke other than in hologram form, there is no exact information as to his true size. He could be as small Jimny Cricket for all we know and he could be using the hologram to pull a Wizard of Oz

This would not even be the first time she has used a hologram either. After the battle of Yevin, Maz hired a [mercenary] (http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Saponza) to “stop” the empire on collecting too much information on her. her hands are not exactly clean either.

Now to address the issue of the scar on the forehead. Sorry buddy, your stumped is what you are probably thinking to yourself. Well, you got some nerve. Though Maz could kind of look like him it does not explain why the projection of her/him is so distorted. Well, the answer is simple, force phantom. [Force phantoms] (http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Force_phantom) is a sith power that allows one to create an image of another living thing and be [anything they want.] (http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Dopplegänger) So Maz could be projecting a scarred old man, a true representation of herself. If you do not buy the hologram explanation, then the force phantom fits just as well. As per the article, the last force user to perfect this was Darth Vectivus. during her long life , it is entirely possible she learned this ability as [Darth Vectivus] (http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Darth_Vectivus)  was able to teach this ability even after his death.
To sum things; Snoke is a projection (force phantom or hologram) of Maz Kanata. Maz is an ancient force user who told Kylo about the blue light saber and promoted him to the leader of Knights of Ren. Being both Snoke &amp; Maz, she can use his/her influence to make the rebels and first order wipe each other out, thus clearing the way for whatever the K.O.R ultimate goal.

23,2016-10-10 23:06:17+00:00,self.FanTheories,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/56uzw2/a_hair_brained_theory_as_to_why_michael_myers_can/,False,"Michael Myers has [congenital insensitivity to pain.] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_insensitivity_to_pain).  It is because of this abnormality as to why he can take so much damage (bullets , beatings etc) and still keep trucking on and bust through doors like the Kool-Aid man except not giving you a refreshing drink but rather a cold taste of death. This would also explain his inhuman like strength. Now why in Gods name a mental institution decided that letting the homicidal maniac  go to the gym and buff up was a good idea is beyond me. What I can say is that without feeling any pain, Michael is able to exerts himself beyond that of normal people. There is no pain indicator that to tell him he is going rip something. The term ""No pain , no gain"" does not apply to him because he doesn't feel pain so to him it's all gains. 

From the Wikipedia entry, most cases of CI happen to be in Sweden. The surname Myers just happens to be an old [Norse surname meaning marsh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers). Keeping this in mind, I turn to Rob Zombie 2007 Halloween remake were we are introduced to a [young Michael Myers] (https://discdoesretro.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/michael-myers-halloween-rob-zombie-3517422-548-366.jpg) As we can see, young crazy seems to resemble all the typical Swedish features such as the pale skin and blonde hair. 

To go further I believe that because of this condition Michael Myers is autistic. As per sources, people who have PI have an increased chances of being autistic and good ol slashy slash does show signs of being autistic. Let's look at reasons why Michael is autistic. 

The first and most obvious one is his inability to talk. In the remake, the only time Michael talks is when he is a young child. It is not until later that he completely stopped all forms of verbal communication. This is known as [language regression] (https://www.autismspeaks.org/science/science-news/language-regression-autism) in autistic children whereas they lose the ability to communicate later in life. Michael exhibits this and occurred sometime after his mother died to his initial escape from the mental hospital. Another obvious sign of his regression is his loss of motor skills. Michael went from being able to run and walk normally to what I refer to as ""death shuffle"". He walks at a ridiculously slow pace it makes me wonder how he ever even catches anybody. 

Further adding to why he is autistic let's look at his behaviors.  For as much as he is an effective killer, he is pretty basic person. He exhibits repetitive, obsessive  behavior and unfortunately his outlet for this is killing people for no damn good reason. Michael doesn't understand empathy for life or have any feelings toward people other then his family and even then that's thrown out the window by his repeated attempts to kill his sister. Michael does not see people as people he see's them as things he can toy with and kill.

I think that to catch a legendary , one has to have all the gym medals and the type medals.

Recently , Niantic announced that they are working on further their worldwide release which has given me hope they will release the game before the end of August when I leave. I really want that farfetched. 

From what I have read from Hong Kong and &amp; Brazilian users, I am afraid of is that when it launches here that thanks to GPS spoofers, the gyms in the area are going to be impossible for people like me who have waited for the game to take. (If a GPS spoofer can tell me the gym situation in Clark , it would be greatly appreciated.) 

To make things fair, I think Niantic should take away all the Pokemon from all players who registered their capture before the official launch date. We know it's possible as Niantic did it today after the Articuno blunder.

What I am also noticing is maybe a reason as to why there is so much drama and maybe it's just a very simple obvious answer. 

3 Step bug and removal of tracking: I'll give you my obvious answer and then my tin foil hat answer on this. 

Normal: I observed that there is a correlation between the servers going down this issue. When the ""Bug"" first appeared, the servers somewhat stabilized more. I think the 3 step tracking was causing a strain on the servers which by removing it, alleviated server bandwidth because it didn't have to work as hard. The server just pooped out a Pokemon at a location and didn't have play hot/cold with so many people going to that one spot, to that one Pokemon. 

Tin Foil hat theory: due to all the recent world wide Attacks on major cities around the world, Google and Niantic hands have been forced by world security officials to remove the tracking. Maybe some see it as a risk because it can lure people to take a certain path, which if ever hacked by the wrong hands could mean hell. 

Why no communication from Niantic?: I don't think Niantic is stupid or have their head so far up their ass they don't think it's a problem. They see the App Store ratings, they see the social media backlash and they see the numbers dwindling of active users. Why would they not issue a statement ? Because of money. More importantly , the money that they made Nintendo and how much the stock grew then fell when it was ""discovered"" Nintendo doesn't make the game. They are probably under a ""shit the fuck up because anything you say cause could fuck the stock prices"" code.  

How Niantic can fix this and save face: The answer isn't that hard. Communicate and say tell the community why they did what they did and if they plan to fix it. Also, offer the community something, an incentive to go back, something like ""trainers who hit level 30 by the end of Aug will be eligible for the Gen 2 update (when released) for free."" 

Those are my thoughts. Tell me what you think.

This sounds like Gord is saying he is not himself, he is having mood swings and how it's eating up inside. Mood swings are a symptom of a brain tumour.   He knows he has something and it's killing him. (That was actually hard to write )

 Next we have the chorus again; *someone come and save my life, could it be this misery will suffice?*

Though I still have quite a few stories to tell, I have decided to tell you about a phenomenon that I can't explain. 

A few months back, I told the story about how when my grandpa died, I was dreaming about talking to him and woke up the exact same time he passed. Well, it seems it has happened again, but instead of my grandpa , it's an ex gf. 

I like to think I am a happily married man, but over the course of the last 2 years I have been having on and off dreams about my ex gf (usually 2 or 3 a year). In these dreams we talk about old times, the future and where our lives are now. No big deal right? Typical dream stuff. Well over the last year the dreams have been more vivid and more detailed then I would care to imagine. 

For example; in one dream we talked about the Toronto Raptors and how I won tickets to the game and that she and her BF had already had tickets. When I went to the game, I saw her there. She didn't see me. I chalked it up to coincidence or maybe I was influenced by one of her FB posts. A few months later, I had a dream we were back at her old house when we were dating. Here we talked about the game and I told her I was there. In the dream still, she said how she has been waking up thinning about me for some reason, sometimes. That maybe we should leave each other a sign in the real world  if we really are communicating. I woke up and immediately checked my Facebook and there was nothing from her. Okay, no big deal. That was the end of it, just dreams then. Well, about 2 weeks later, I see one of her friends liked my picture and commented saying ""[my ex] said you were on here and I should like one of your pics"" I PM'd her and asked her why she said that and she said that [my ex] didn't want to like something of mine because she wouldn't want my wife to upset. 

Well, this past weekend I had another dream with her in it. This time she said I was getting chubby and I should try to work out more. I woke up saying ""yeah, I totally should"". It's hard to explain but her telling me that made it really stick, at least dream her. I messaged her on FB after almost 8 months since we last talked and had a really good convo, like the dream. She said something like ""I had a feeling you were going to message me"" 

Any ideas as to what's going on? ",Paranormal,Connecting through a dream,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/4m5wg2/connecting_through_a_dream/

I think that they have focused so much on the Smoak family because they are about to experience a tragedy. What my theory is that Donna Smoak is going to end up getting killed by the end of the episode. This fits in with the whole Olicity thing too because now they will have the same tragic event to bring them closer and back together. Also, this will again cement Captain Lance as a very tragic character who keeps losing people he loves. 

Personally, I believe if that does happen , Lance will blame Oliver and team arrow for her death and out his secret identity to the world, causing Oliver and his loved ones to go into hiding, thus setting up the next season.

I can't believe it has gotten to this and I mean I physically and mentally can't believe it. As I do to everything I  don't believe, I analyze it until I find out what happened and I think I have figured it out. 

The problem is Stephen Amell, or rather the lack of Stephen Amell. For the past few seasons, he has had some sort of creative control as he is so active on social media and he listens to the people. Recently though with him filming TMNT 2, he was not able to get the feedback from the fans he would have normally and relay it to the writing team. Instead Guggy has been entrusted to write a script knowing that Amell wont be as available so his character has to have scenes that can be easly shot. Scenes like stupid love story Bullshit.  Has he gone overboard? 100%. Was it all his fault? Maybe not. The CW loves their tumbler fans and I'm sure have relayed to the writing team to ""keep up the good work"" and this is the result

With that being said, I think next season will be much better. Amell will be more available. He will and probably has been telling the writers that we are losing people because of the whole Felicity BS and hopefully the show will be written and taken back to its roots. I have an idea for a season 5 intro that would be bad ass, but I'll post that later.

Ladies and Gentlemen of this sub, I am a Canadian that strongly believes that American's , like the rest of the world has , will truly benefit from the socialist ideals that Senator Sanders is proposing. As I am sure your highly aware that the term ""socialist"" doesn't bode well with some people, especially since most people associate it with ""communist"". Generation X's and the baby boomers have a very negative association to the word communist as they remember things like the Cuban missile crisis and the Cold War, and understandably so. Hell, some people have even started calling him Comrade Sanders which is hilarious in its own right. 

The only way now to change people's mind about sanders is to educate them about his plan, and his plan for the generations to come. You all need to hit specific points with people when you phone bank and leave them thinking 

Some points that need to be covered are; 

His plan for helping Americans retire. Tell the people that Sanders doesn't want to see them working all their lives. Tell people that they do not want to be a 70 year old man working as a greeter at WalMart, or a fry cook answering to a boss 1/3 their age. He wants people to enjoy their winter years and be able to live a dignified retirement complete with healthcare and a healthy pension. 

Healthcare. American's this is something that is a no brainer. How is it that you are the only major country without universal healthcare, well the answer is simple;$$$$$. You need to explain to people, especially older people or new parents that Bernies plan would bring in universal health care. Remind them of obesity and other epidemics that are ravaging the county. Bring up numbers on how expensive it is to have cancer treatment or just general operations. Tell them of how their are so many examples of people having to sell their car or homes to just be able to afford the treatment for themselves or a loved one, whereas in Bernies plan it would have already been covered. Let them know that in Canada, operations like Cataract surgery or Knee replacements are covered under our universal healthcare. That lab work for the most part is as well.. That ongoing cancer treatments are covered. That by paying a percent or two more in taxes, it will cover them for the rest of their lives. It's an investment in themselves and their families well being. Also, tell them that not everyone's job offers benefits and maybe later on, their benefits will be cut and they will left with a limited healthcare plan that would not cover a lot of things that a universal healthcare plan would. 

Education. Young people are bold and make impulsive decisions and this applies to choosing their career. What about someone wanting to re-enter the workforce or someone who needs to find a new career. Should they be doomed to not achieve a higher education because they are on the wrong end of a  socioeconomic system that will put them in a possible lifetime of debt? Sanders is proposing to make education free to colleges and universities. This I think will hit hard with immigrant families as one the of stables or ""dreams"" is to have their children achieve a level higher then them. 

Lastly; talk about the events of NY, NV and New Mexico and the scrupulous acts of the DNC. Tell them how they are not giving the people a fair vote and they are using tactics that are only heard of in 3rd world countries to keep a ruling party in power, no matter what the cost and ignoring what the people truly want. If you should encounter a HRC supporter , just tell them that if they truly agree and believe she is their candidate then al the best to her. There is no need to drag her name through the mud, she seems to be doing a good job of that herself. 

Oh sorry, one last thing. If anyone says ""Sanders is going to take away all your money and my money"" politely remind that of who will see feel the biggest impact in their taxes. So unless your making I think over ""80k a year"" then say"" what money"" just kidding. Don't say that. Speaking of money, please make sure you donate as the upcoming elections will be an uphill battle and the campaign will need all the exposure it can get, and exposure costs money.

Manchester United are in a position to finish outside the top 6 making this one of their worst seasons ever. It's no secret Manchester United has been going downhill the last few seasons after the departure of Fergie. 

What I think is wrong with Manchester United isn't that they lack talent or drive or some locker room politics on getting LVG sacked, but rather their training regiment. 

I honestly do think that the problem is not LVG , but rather Giggs. Like I mentioned in an earlier comment, the, guys on the team fully respect Giggs not just as a Man U legend , but also as a player. It's also safe to say that Giggs spends more time with the players then LVG. What I mean by more time is running with the team, setting up drills and set pieces and other team training exercises. What ,In my opinión is happening is that Giggs reverts back to the exercises and training he learned under Fergie as he is used to. He runs drills that though are correct, might not be what LVG wants his players to be learning or doing. 

I'm in no way saying  Giggs is sabotaging the training , but his style of training clashes with the LVG vision and this causes the players to play sort of scattered as what they did in training is not what the manager is wanting them to do and the results are showing on the field. This is why a lot of managers bring in their own guys when they move to a new team. It's because these trainers already know what the manager wants and aim their training towards it. 

To use an analogy; it's like being hired for a new job and in training you learn about the job using Windows XP. Then when you are out of training , you find out your working on a MAC. Yes the skills are transferable , but your going to struggle  ",soccer,The problem with Man U,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/4ivwri/the_problem_with_man_u/

The only way to fix arrow is have Oliver go back to his old brooding tough decision making self. To me, this is what made the show great. This is what made the whole Olicity great too. They wanted to be with one another but couldn't because of the danger and such. Now the whole relationship has been turned around where he needs to be with her and she calls the shots etc. The show has jumped the shark in that respect and simply having them break up won't be good enough for the show's Olicity fans. So how do we fix this ? With LoT

The nice thing about time travel is that is it can help undo errors in both the writing and appeal to fan service. Luckily, they have a show dedicated to time travel set in the same universe. So this is an idea I had on how to finally correct all off the mistakes made that is causing arrow to loose viewers and fans. The first correction that needs to be made is brining back Laurel. 

Create a story arc that crosses with arrow and Lot and start the arc in LoT. The arc should start that team has to travel back to the old man Oliver future where him and Conner Hawke are operating. It is here that Sara finds out about her sisters death and decides that she is going to hijack the time machine and go back to the point where the decision to destroy the Lazarus is made and convince Talia (her beloved) to not do it. She also tells her to tell team  arrow she did, this way she isn't interrupting the time line of season 4. After Laurel is buried the league gets her body and now Laurel is on the same path Sara. This is a nice way of the sisters going full circle. This also opens the doors to new , or returning  villains. 

Now onto the whole Olicity thing. Simply having those 2 break up would be a terrible fan service or killing her off would be the worse, as she is a main character. My idea is that in the Future during one of the CW's mandated heart to heart talks, old man Oliver admits that for the good of the future, he and felicity can not be together. That he should have cut it off earlier. He gives Sara a message in the form of a video to give to his younger self and in it says that he needs to break up with her. This even opens up the story a bit if they want because they could have one of team arrow members see this message and hold it from Oliver for a few episodes until something happens that they are forced to show him the message.

I'm currently hopped on Modofinal and the stuff has really kicked. Rather be productive at work, my attention has turned to the Flash TV show and the identity of the Man in the Iron Mask. 

First thing, first. Let's look at the (tentative) name, Man in the iron mask. History theorizes that he man in the in the iron mask was none other then King Louis the 14 identical twin brother, just a few mins older. Why is this important? Well to me it's important because this show does name its characters random things  just for the sake of naming. No, each meta human is given a nickname which either represents their power or their personality. Identical older twin to me sounds like it could also be , counterpart from the future. 

Now, let's look at who it could possibly be in that mask. First thing is first, let's eliminate the women in the show as though it would be cool to see a gender swapped version of Barry or Cisco I do not see it happening. 

If we agree that the nick name (MiTIM) is foreshadowing to who the character is, then we have to assume he is a major character, or if you will a King Character. So let me get a few characters out of the way that would not fit this King category. 

Joe: I am not going to bet it's a different version of Joe as we already earth 2 Joe get killed. 

Eddie: Our beloved Eddie Thawne in my opinion does not seem to be a high contender for me. The actor is already working on other projects as well as it would not seem to fit the direction  of show as if he did return, he would be most likely be involved in Love triangle with Iris and her new editor BF. Since their is not that much of a focus on Iris relationship, I am going to cross off out sweet prince Eddie. 

Wells: Wait , why am I not including Wells as a king or main contender to be in the mask? Because it's a little far fetched. Wells earth 1 is dead and it seems like Wells earth 2 is here to stay. If for whatever reason they kill off Wells earth 2 and keep Tom on board, I do not see Wells having any kind of super power. 

Cisco and Ronnie: This one is kind of obvious as Ciscos and Ronnies earth 2 counterparts have already been shown and wrote off. 

Now onto the Main suspects. 

Reverse Flash/Eobard Thawne: So we know zoom needs speedsters to keep him alive. We also know that he is faster then zoom (I base this on the fact Barry and Zoom were almost equal in speed last season and Barry without the Booster can't match Zoom) Is is possible that when Thawne died last season , he in fact didn't die but was transferred to earth 2 where he met Jay/hunter and got his powers robbed from him. Zoom might be keeping him alive to give him info on the speed Force and future events. To be honest, this one is pretty low on the list for me as I can not see him being useful more then providing info on who the Flash E1 is. 

Another Jay/Hunter Z. Everybody reading this , please do me a favour. Next time you go wash your hands, please splash some water on your face and then look in mirror because there is probably a good change you will see this [face looking back at you] (http://lovelace-media.imgix.net/uploads/465/a323ed30-e7db-0133-f168-0aacbc4f5d01.jpg?) because why the hell not. 

Let's look at we know about Zoom. First thing and most importantly, he needs other speedsters speed force to stay alive. We first see this early on in the season when he ""Jay"" tells the story of how he lost his powers. He said that Zoom stole his powers and now he is about as fast as the rest of us. It is possible that is the truth , but rather after stealing his speed force and then killing him, he instructs the Jay we knew(the one that got killed) to find a way to get more speed if he wants to live, thus his quest for the speed force formula. It also sort of explains on how Jay got there in the first place. To me, zoom probably ""Zoomed"" him there as he could not since he has no speed force to break the dimensional barrier. So in fact the ""Jay"" we first met is a no speedster. This is further evidenced by the fact that Snow takes samples of his blood, she does not detect the speed force like she would with Barry. So it is entirely possible that this Zoom is traveling to different parts in his timeline and stealing other Zooms speed force, which would explain why perhaps he is still alive. It could also be possible that the MiTIM is a version of him that is yet to be cursed with the speed force disease which explains why if it was another zoom, he would still be alive. 

Now flipping this, it is possible it could be the original , non powered Jay Garrick. Zoom in fact did capture and steal the original Jay's powers. Since this Jay is essentially him and is not suffering from the speed force curse, Hunter is keeping him as a test subject to find a cure for his dilemma. Sort of in the way ""Jay"" explained to Snow about the first time he introduced her to Earth 1 Hunter Z. (At least  what we assumed was earth 1 Hunter. ) 

So if we assume there is no Earth 1 Hunter Z, but it was rather a past version of him to throw Snow of the trail (as he explained) , then that leaves the question , where and who is Earth 1 Jay? So , it's possibly that zoom traveled to earth 1, picked up Jay to use as a lab rat as he isn't affected by the speed force curse and put a future or past version of himself in his place.  With that said, this is why MiTIM keeps tapping Jay over and over again. Not to tell zoom's identity, but rather who he is. 

The probability to me is medium low on this one because holy fuck that's confusing. 

Wally West; I do not have much to support Wally as the MiTIM other then the following 3 points. 

We have not yet seen Earth 2 Wally West. We in fact have not even been hinted as to who or where he is. This seems intentional as they have already shown every major characters Earth 2 counterpart except Wally. 

Next is the very fact we know he is to become a speedster. His introduction would have to have been intentional. So it's possibly that perhaps this a de powered version of Wally West. 

Lastly, the reaction the MiTIM had when he saw he Wally in the cage. The dude flipped out, like anyone would when they see their counterpart. Also, it stands out to me as it he did not seem to have that reaction when any of the other characters were locked up in Zoom's lair.(btw, zoom lair kinda sucks for security. Almost everyone that he has captured escapes) 

So, based on this, I saw medium probability. 

Barry :So if you have read this far into this post I thank you and would now like to present to you why it could be Barry

Let's start with the obvious, we have already met E2 Barry. He is just a normal guy from E2. Right, no big deal. We agree on this? Good. 
Well folks, if it is a Barry then it's not going to be that Barry but rather a different Barry or alternate time line Barry. 

There is not much to suggest this in my opinion other then the timing of the reveal of the identity of MiTIM. He will be revealed in the season finale which like all shows will setup the next season. So if we are to assume that this a de powered Barry, we have to ask ourselves the question, which Barry is this? Well to me it can be no other then future Barry that disappeared in the crisis. 

In his fight with reverse flash in the past , Barry was able to escape leaving RF behind. What if he did not escape in time like we are led to believe but rather traveled to Earth 2 where he encountered and was defeated by Zoom. Now Zoom seeing an opportunity to steal another speedsters powers from a different dimension is the cause of him coming up with this plan to steal E1 Barry's powers. Also, that is the reason he doesn't simply kills Flash in their first encounter and tells E2 wells to make him faster. He was fattening him up. 

To me this also explains why the newspaper clipping from the future doesn't change, or why E1 future Barry has never traveled back in time to help him, or correct anything. So if is that  E1 future Barry is the MiTM and after they release him, he has to travel to his time line to fix whatever damaged has been caused in , get ready for this , the beginning of the Flashpoint Story line 

So this sort of goes back to whole identity of of MiTIM. He is an older identical twin of the King, or if you will a future version of the show's main character 

Sorry for the wall of text. 

Edit: Spelling and formatting 

Edit 2: adding my analysis of Henry Allen probability 

Oh crap, how could I over look JWS character Henry Allen. Okay let me give him the Modifinal one over and see what I come up with. 

First JWS has been absent for most of the season and there has been almost no mention of him throughout the season so either they have downplayed the character , or the writers are playing the long con and waiting for the reveal. 

Like Wally West, there has been no mention of his earth 2 counterpart. 

The writers do love their meta references in the show and what a bigger meta reference than having the 90s flash captured in his jail of a Thousand exit's. 

Other then those, I do not really see any reason he will be MiTIM. My opinion is low probability. I would not put him in my ""King"" Column.

First thing first, bring back Laurel. Not just because she is a great character , but because in the comic Oliver is supposed to end up with black canary. How can this be done without being some lame cop out or magic pit? Simple, just like the answer to all of the Flashs problems; time travel. I don't think time travel from the flash though, but rather from LoT. 

My idea is that the LoT team has to revisit the future where old man Oliver and Conner Hawke now have joined forces. Those 2 somehow teaming up really messed up the timeline and now the team has to go back and fix it. Perhaps those 2 joining up causes Oliver to die prematurely so he couldn't form up a resistance and that's is a reason savage was so easily able to take over. There will be a scene Sara asks about Laurel and Conner, rather then Oliver tell Sara what happened to her sister and her death. After they resolve their issue, Sara forces Oliver to tell her what went wrong. Oliver in his usual tone tells Sara what happened to Laurel and how they couldn't save her. How felicity and him being distracted with their relationship caused her to loose the company and eventually move away.  That she could not take being the Green Arrows wife and such. Sara then decides that she will take it upon herself to fix things. Oliver seeing there is only one way to make things right tells Sara that if she plans on saving Laurel, she should  also give his younger self a letter (or recording) telling him to break it off with felicity before its to late for either of them. Sara also plans on taking some Vandel Savages blood and use it as a sort of cure for Laurel.  Against Rips advice and whatever doom he says about the timeline changing by saving her sister. Sara not giving a fuck goes to the past and saves her sister, gives young Oliver the message from his future self. Young Oliver broods for an episode or two and then decides He should break up with felicity permanently by doing something crazy like sleeping with a now revived Laurel or his baby momma. Being a whiny annoying character, Felicity gets on her wheelchair, rolls away and then for no other reason to be over dramatic stands up and says something something that will make everyone watching the show roll their eyes.  What's interesting about my idea  is that no other member of the team will have knowledge that Laurel actually died except for the LoT team and Oliver who vows to never tell, but of course tells Laurel eventually and mentions how she said to him that she never stopped loving him. From that point on, they try to make it work.

I want to share something that happened to me about 8 years ago that I still can't explain. I am torn if it was real, or if it was an overactive imagination.  

I was working for a large hotel chain in downtown Toronto as a night houseman. My job was basically keep the public areas clean, help out the night staff and take out the garbage. I also happen to work with an older man who claimed to be male witch and followed as he described ""an old pagan religion that I would never understand nor should I try"". He also refused to touch me as he said that he wouldn't know how my distant Incan decent would react. To be completely honest I thought this guy was a nut job, a nice guy but a nut job.  

Fast forward to my last day on the job. Him and I had actually become pretty close, joking around and him telling me stories about hauntings, driving out demons from people and other paranormal stories. (If anyone cares, I'll add an edit about how he said a rival witch was trying to curse someone he cared about and he driving her out almost killed him) 

As I am leaving and packing up my locker he comes in and say goodbye. As a gesture I reach out my hand and say it was a pleasure to meet you. Well I guess he must have felt comfortable enough to shake my hand back. As he shook my hand, an overwhelming feeling came across my body. It felt like someone had opened up my head and started shaking things around.  I looked at him and he gave me this look, like saying ""Told you so"" 

I start making my way home, still feeling really odd I got on the subway. It's about 12 midnight so there isn't that many people. The people that were on though , I swear I was able to read their thoughts. Yes, I know I sound like a nut or whatever but that's what I experienced. There was a lesbian couple on the subway and I could hear whispers of, ""he is cute"" &amp; ""Claudette better not be looking at him""  I said out loud ""Claudette"" and one of the girls turned around and asked me ""do I know you"" I said no and she turned away. I swear I heard after ""that guy is weird"" 

It lasted maybe 15 mins at most and I never again experienced something like this. Anyone ever experience anything like this? ",Paranormal,The first and only time I ever experienced ESP,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/4c8v9t/the_first_and_only_time_i_ever_experienced_esp/

Really weird things happen like objects moving on their own, shadows looking out the window and the last year things disappearing only to be found in random places (best example is my car keys ended up in the bathroom cupboard or toothpaste pressed all over the sync. 

The last few weeks though, things have gotten a little to weird and ignoring whatever is here is becoming more and more difficult. The other day I was woken up by something yelling in my ear loudly. I've been having dreams where something is telling me it has control of me. That it makes me move my right arm and such, though that could be my imagination. 

What's is really worrying me now is that I'm convinced my 18 month old nephew see's something. There have been times where he looks up at a spot in the ceiling and starts crying. A few mins later we hear things like footsteps above where he is looking or a door shutting from the room he see is looking at. Also, he randomly starts laughing and starts throwing things at one specific spot for no reason. 

Things have been escalated a touch. All this time, this ""thing"" has not been violent in anyway. Tonight though my wife fell down the stairs. She said she felt something pull her feet when she was walking down. The other day I felt something scratch at me when I was in the shower. It seems it really wants out attention. 

Any ideas on what it could be and what I can do to drive it out?

The vases were made from mud and had a face carved on them. We were given them by a family friend who said he wanted to give us something special for visiting Peru. He claimed he bought them from a local in Pisco region of Peru. (Where Machu Pichu is). 

We brought it back home to Canada and pretty much from week 1, a horrible streak of bad luck and accidents began to happen to our family. My mom came down with cataract at a very young age, my father lost both his jobs. My brother and I were both constantly sick and my little sister would start screaming randomly. Pretty much on the verge of being homeless, we were looking for things to sell and came across these things. We didn't know if we could even sell them and for how much. To get an idea on there value, we called one of my dads friend in Peru who had worked in a museum in Peru. 

After a bit of back and forth, he told my dad that these type of items are not meant to leave its home soil and are not worth more then a few bucks. He said that these items are probably cursed. He said to lift the curse we  prick our fingers and smear a little bit of blood on each one and send them back. Now, we of course we're very sceptical and thought that they were probably worth something. We assumed the guy wanted them so he can sell them. I mean, a blood sacrifice? That's ridiculous.  

Fast forward 2 days, my mother and father get into a pretty nasty car accident. They were okay but they both needed to be off work for a few weeks. After that,  they both decided that maybe we should send them back and do the blood thing.

We sent them back the next week and after that, things got noticeably better. My father found a very good job as did my mom. We found a really good place to live with a very low rent and overall better health.

Tonight I am going to tell you all another story about the hauntings my parents and uncle experienced while working as night cleaners at the Keg in Toronto Ontario. 

This story will be a follow up on my previous 2 re-tellings about something trying to [lure us into a basement] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/49h7a9/something_tried_luring_me_and_my_friend_into_a/) and [my mothers encounter with a poltergeist] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/49jexg/my_mothers_phantom/). I also want to mention this story is as real as I believe it to be. I was not there for this one and was told this story by both my uncle and father, so it's a second hand account.  Also this story is the reason that they quit the job later that week. 

My mother, father and uncle arrived at the restaurant late at night as per usual. They already had a really good, efficient routine down to be there as short as possible because at this point they were a bit on edge because of all the strange and unexplainable occurrences though things had been pretty quit for the past few weeks. They start their usual sweep of the restaurant , check for areas that need more attention then others and other boring stuff that comes with night cleaning. 

My uncle and father were working the kitchen while my mother was going about vacuuming the dining room. About 2 hours into the night , my father tells my uncle he is going out for a smoke and to continue working until he gets back. My uncle obliged and went about his work. What happened to him next was something that to this day he, or anyone can explain. 

As he was cleaning the kitchen floors he suddenly heard knocking coming from the freezer (or walk in fridge). He said he first ignored because of the occurrences that had previously happened. As he continued working, he heard it again only louder, but this time there was a voice. My uncle decided to open the fridge and see what the noise was. He remembers thinking to himself it could maybe a kitchen worker that might have locked himself in there so he decides to open it. Of course, being very cautious he slowly opens the fridge and well, nothing. There is nothing in there or at least nothing he could see. What he described to me on what happened next really scares me even as I write this. 

He said that he stepped into fridge/freezer (I should mention that this is one of those walk in fridges that you walk into, like you see in tv shows and such). As he walked in he heard some scratching coming from the back. My uncle being the curious type decides to go check it out as it could be mice or some other animal. As he made his way the fridge door suddenly closes behind him. As he turned around to try to open the door from the inside he said it felt like the lever was jammed. Well not jammed, more like someone or something was pushing against it to not let him out. He remembers telling himself that he can not believe he was so stupid and he let himself get lured in. 

My uncle , now stuck inside the fridge starts yelling out for someone to open the door. Luckily my father had just come back from his smoke break and heard his screams. My father very easily opens the door from the outside and let's my uncle out. Now I would like to switch perspectives for a moment because I think it's important to the story. I'll tell you what I over heard my father telling my mother about the moments before he let my uncle out of the fridge. He said as he was finishing up his smoke outside the one of the exit doors, the wooden wedge he had put to keep the door from shutting behind him suddenly broke. He was now forced to go around the building to get my moms attention to let him through the front entrance. I think it's also important to point out he has left the keys in his jacket in the kitchen and the door he was smoking around was one of those exit only type metal doors. 

After my uncle comes pretty much running out of the fridge my father and him have a short talk about what happened. My father tells my uncle that the door is perhaps designed to shut behind and maybe because he was panicking he could not get the door open from the inside. My uncle at this point just wants the night to be done so they both decide to finish the job and go home and sleep off this eerie encounter my uncle just had. 

Fast forward an hour later. My father and uncle are just about finished the kitchen. My mother is doing her final rounds and everything seems to be normal. Just as my uncle and father are putting the finishing touches on the sink , one of the hanging pots falls from the rack. My uncle goes to pick it up and another one falls, this time right by his foot. As my uncle started to reach for the second pot the knife set on the counter falls over. It is at this point that all the pots and other things start falling on them. My father said that his initial reaction was earthquake so he took shelter under the one of the big metal tables in the kitchen. My father had to drag my uncle by his shirt to get under the table because everything was falling on them.  After about 10 to 15 secs of pots and knifes falling on them it suddenly stopped. My mother came running to the kitchen when she heard noises. She said that she the both of them huddled underneath this table surrounded by pots, pans and all manner of silverware. My father told my mom to not come in the kitchen until the earthquake stopped. My mother told him there was no earthquake, that part of the world doesn't get earthquakes like they do back home (back home being Peru where quakes and after shocks are pretty common). 

After a few minutes , the 2 finally decided it was safe to come out from under the table. This time though it was my father that said screw this ,we are leaving right now and not coming back. As they went to get their coats from the utility room my father mentioned that he got a very eerie feeling that something was watching him. It was at this moment that the 3 decided it would be best to give the job to someone else. 

Just a quick follow up on what happened after they quit. My father gave the job to one of my older cousins. We had told him about what happened and why they quit. My cousin , who didn't believe none of it decided he and his wife would take the job. About 2 weeks later they quit because of the strange occurrences. He never went into detail as to what specifically happened, but from what I heard from his wife telling my mother was that something had thrown a glass at him and in the bar area , the TV's started turning on and off by themselves. 

I hope you guys enjoyed my stories. I was suggested I should post it in r/nosleep but because these stories are true, it wouldn't quite fit in that sub Reddit. I have a few more stories about the restaurant, as well as few more about some really strange things that has happened to my uncle in his life time. One particular one being about the time he was in prison and his cell mate started screaming because something was attacking him in the cell.

A short recap from my last post. My parents and uncle were employed to perform night cleaning duties at the Keg restaurant in Toronto Ontario. Today I will be sharing with you all the story of my mothers encounter with a phantom or poltergeist. (I saw ""or"" because it's kind of in a grey area and after reading the story , I think you should decide your interpretation)

After about working at the restaurant for a few weeks my parents had a routine set up to make the work go faster. They would come in, turn on the lights, do a quick scout of the restaurant and see if there are any major issues that require immediate attention (ie; carpet stains, broken glass etc). Well this particular night, my mom got a rather supernatural surprise. 

When my parents arrived they instantly started their usual routine.  This particular night, my father noticed that there was a grease spill in the kitchen so he and my uncle needed to focus their attention there. My mom went on her way to do a quick scout of the restaurant. As she was walking towards the bar in the back she said she was someone or something  from the corner of her eye. Thinking it was perhaps a staff member or client she walked towards it. When she arrived at the bar she saw a man just sitting at a bar wearing a dark long coat and a hat, with his face down. My mom shouted out ""Hey, the restaurant is closed. You need to leave."" The man slowly raised his head up and slowly  turned towards my mother. What she saw next put her on edge for the rest of the night. 

She described the man as having an all black face. Almost like a shadow was cast over his face. She, rightfully a little shocked just looked at him. She then said that the man muttered something and looked to start getting up. At this point my mothers ""fight or flight"" instinct must have kicked in and her reaction was to run and get my uncle or father who were in the kitchen. 

When she arrived at the kitchen my father and uncle were in the middle of their clean up routine. My mother explained what she had saw to my uncle. My uncle being the overprotective type, grabs a knife from the kitchen as a just in case this person is a drunk and violent. 

When they arrive at the bar area they are surprised to see no one was there. Not even a trace of someone and that is what was odd. The reason I saw that is what was odd is because the now the bar stools were on the bar. My uncle not sure what to make of this tells my mom it might have been some drunk that sneaked in and left via the fire door. My mom, still scared accepts his explanation and decides to continue with her work. The only thing is that the fire door in the back would trigger the alarm if opened my mother argued. Irregardless , they looked for a good 15 mins and decided to go back to work. 

Unfortunately , this was not the end of the occurrence for the night. As my mother was sweeping the bar floor things from the bar would casually fall off. Things like the bar nuts or debris from people's unfinished drinks. She at this point more frustrated then scared just kept cleaning it up. As the night progressed stranger things kept occurring. As she was vacuuming the dining room the vacuum would shut off randomly. When she went to see why, she would notice  the plug was pulled from the wall. When she tracked back and reconnected, she would find her vacuum pole had been moved to another part of the dining room. 

Before I go any further , I should mention something about my moms personality. She isn't afraid of ghosts. Her moto is ""the living will scare you more then the dead ever could"" so I guess it was this philosophy that gave my mom the courage to continue with her work. 

Right before they started wrapping up for the night  my mothers vacuum pole had again been moved, this time to a booth. When my mother went to go get it she said she felt something cold on her neck and then something pulled her shirt. It was at this point my mother screamed and my father left the kitchen to go see what's wrong. 

On his way to the where my mother was, my father yelled out for her saying things like ""what's wrong &amp; where are you"". He said that every time he yelled that he would hear responses from different sides of the restaurant. Luckily , he saw the vacuum cord and followed it to where my mother was. As he approached my mother my father said he felt something that he could not explain and frightened him. 

What he felt was something try to trip him along with a cold air up his back. My father being the stubborn guy he is ignored it and went to my mother. When he got there, my mother was sitting down at the booth in what later we learned was shock. My father helped her up and the both walked to car and that was where my mother stayed for the rest of the night. 

Just to add a little bit of humour, or weird a weird coincidence to this, as my father went to go wrap up the vacuum that was at the booth there was now a wallet with about $1200 in cash on the counter. Not knowing what to do, my father took the wallet and found the owners  business card in it. My father called it in the morning to leave a message that he was going to leave in the lost and found at the restaurant. Funny enough the guy answered and ask to meet with my dad that very morning. The owner of the wallet met up with my father in a local gas station and gave him $500 reward, so that was good right? 

If you guys want to hear more, I'll gladly share another one, probably the most violent one. 

Edit: Oh wow, I really dropped the grammar ball on this one. I cleaned it up to make it more readable. 

I'll be posting another one later on tonight.

I recently discovered this sub Reddit and have slowly began realizing that I have a lot of paranormal stories I can share with you all. Tonight, I want to re-tell a story telling that happened about 15 years ago when my parents were the night cleaners for the keg restaurant in Toronto Ontario. FYI I posted this story about a year back and since then I think my story telling and writing skills have improved enough to give this story justice on how actually creepy it was. 

You can skip the next paragraph if you don't really care about the background as to why my parents were working there. 

Growing up , we did not have much money so as a result to make ends meat, my parents and uncle who was living with us had to take on an extra job. This particular job happened to be a night cleaning job at the Keg restaurant on airport road in the city of Toronto , Ontario. My parents did not have someone to watch us younger kids ,so often we would tag along and just sleep in the restaurant or car. Like I said, we were poor. Even though the job paid well and it wasn't exactly back breaking labor and my parents still quit because of a lot of the supernatural and strange phenomena that occurred while working there. 

I'll start with the first and most important paranormal story that happened to me and my uncles girlfriend at the time. 

It was around 3:30 am and the restaurant was fully lit. In distance you can hear the conversation between my father and uncle talking about the recent soccer match. I, who was about 11 at the time was sitting at a table near the bar with my uncles girlfriend just talking and trying to pass the time. At some point , like most nights we both nodded off and were usually woken by one of my parents telling us it's time to go. Well this particular night was one that I will never forget. 

My uncles girlfriend and I had nodded off beside each other when we were both suddenly woken by uncle. My uncle, who is normally a very happy go lucky guy shook us both pretty hard and told us to wake up and follow him to the basement. He said he needed help moving something out of the way and it was urgent and it involved my mother.  Her and I quickly jumped up , gathered our things and started to make our way to the basement. In the few moments we have turned to gather our things my uncle was now a good 20 feet in front of us urging us to follow him and it's an emergency. My uncles girlfriend and I look at each other, pause and ask ourselves what's wrong with him and what is this emergency. Well at this point we had lost sight of my uncle. Her and I started to look around the restaurant and could not find him. What happened next is what really brought terror, yes terror to everyone that night. 

As we were looking for my uncle in the restaurant to lead us to the basement , we turn a corner and bump into my uncle, the exact same uncle who had woken us up and told us to follow him. When he saw us looked like he just saw the most terrifying thing possible. We ask my uncle ""hey what is the emergency?"" , he responds with ""You two. Your dad yelled me at me telling me you two were trapped in the basement and he could not open the door. He told me to go to the car and get a crowbar to pry the door open"". We both look at each other and say ""Uncle, what's going on? Just a minute ago you woke us up and told us you needed our help to open the basement door cause something bad happened to my mom"" My uncle replied  ""that's impossible. Your father and I were walking past the basement locked door and heard you and uncles girlfriend yelling for help. Your dad tried to knock the door down, but couldn't so he sent me outside to get something to pry it open. "" 

It was at this point that my father came to where we are with a few object's in his hand that he was planning on using to knock the door down. He looked at us and started scolding us, telling us it's not funny to scare someone like that and asked how we got out. We explained to him that it was my uncle who had woken us up and told him to follow him to the basement. That we were following him when we lost track of him, only to bump into him in and recap what everything up to this point. The 4 of us are standing in the restaurant, looking puzzled trying to figure out what is going on. Just as we are about to continue with the work, my mother who was on the other side of the restaurant comes running towards us saying there is someone trapped in the basement. That she can't open the door and needs help. There is no words I can use to describe the look on our faces other then pure terror. We all knew , except my mom that something was trying to lead us into the basement. That there was something trying separating us. 

After a few mins of shock, we finally collected ourselves and decided it was best we all stayed in the same room for the rest of the night. Fair to say, my parents did a half ass job and got out of there was quick as possible.  

Sorry for the wall of text. If anyone is interested, I can tell a couple more stories including what we believe to be a poltergeist stalking my mother a whole night and my uncle almost getting killed my being tricked into the deep freezer. 

Edit: missed a word. Really glad to hear you guys would like to hear another one. Later on today I'll post another one.

About 6 years or so ago, we got a phone call that my grandpa was on his deathbed. My mother quickly gathered her things and was on the next flight out. That night though I had the oddest dream. 

The dream was that I was in an all white room talking, with my grandpa in the middle of it on a bed. I went up to him and held his hand. It was so vivid, I could feel the texture of his skin. I also remember the smell in the room. It smelled like , well like a hospital. I remember him telling me that it's okay. To be good and strong for my mom. Then he whispers something to me, something I can not to this day remember. I blinked and he transformed into his younger self, smiled and just like that , I woke up with tears in my eyes. My GF who was sleeping beside me said I was talking in my sleep. What she was what was unusual about it is because I was talking in Spanish, but when I dream I dream in English. As soon I woke up, I looked at my phone to see if there was any info from my mom. There wasn't , but the time was 4:32 am. When my mom called me finally , she said she didn't make it and that he had passed sometime around 4:30am. 

Any thoughts on this? Any idea how I could maybe try and job my memory to remember what he whispered to me? ",Paranormal,Something weird that happened when my Grandpa passed,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/4941vq/something_weird_that_happened_when_my_grandpa/

My family and I were on vacation in my parents homeland of Peru. We were driving down some cliffs by the beach when my father pointed out a spot where he almost got killed. He describes that he was jumping from a cliff when he slipped and didn't get the force he wanted in his jump and started tumbling down the cliff side. He said that he thought to himself that he was done for. He said that he remembers a hand pushing him away from the cliff, angling him towards the water. He said through the corner of his eye that it was a human hand in what appears to be a white suit jacket. 

When telling this story , the whole car went silent because it turns out we all had a man in white save our live. 

My older brothers story was when he was about 11 years old. We were living in NJ and being a kid ,he was playing in the street. This one day, a car does not see him and runs him over. What's amazing is that both the front and back tires went over him, yet he got up with just some bruises. He describes that when he fell to the ground, that he saw a pair of white slacks and suit appear and lift the car as it went over him. 

My sisters story was when she was 3 years old. She remembers getting lost in a mall. She said she remembers being very scared and felt incredibly alone. She said was going to leave the mall into the parking lot because that was where she came in from. Who knows what would have happened if she had. She remembers that as she made her way to the door, a man in a white suit grabbed her little hand and smiled at her. She said she felt like she could trust him and walked with her back to the mall. She said he led her to a bench and said to wait for her mom here, that she will be okay.  She let go of his hand and sat at the bench.  Not 5 secs later my mother spotted her. 

Now, mine is a little more on the weird side so I'll understand if your sceptic. When I was 2 years old , I foolishly was playing with a bike that was being repaired. I stupidly put my finger in the pedal gears and ripped my finger off(this is my earliest memory btw). Well here I am losing a lot of blood, with my finger just being held on by a little of skin. My mother panics and calls the ambulance. She is told that one won't get to us for about 45 mins because it can't go on some roads due to flooding. (I should mention that we lived in a rural part of Costa Rica). Well anyways, my mother in a panic decides we should walk to the hospital which was about 60 mins away. After about 2 mins of walking  , a white car pulls up beside us and asks if we need a ride. My mom, who is very mistrusting of strangers , said yes. She can't describe why she said yes, but she felt she could trust him. In the car, I remember it having a light tan interior. The man was of course dressed in all white suit. The man told things to my mom like ""he will be okay"" and ""your husband will be there"" (I forgot to mention that one of the neighbours had called my dad at work and told him we were on the way to the hospital) The man also gave my mother the equivalent of $100 USD (which in the 80's in Central America was huge) and said to use it for my surgery and bandages. After about 10 min of driving , the man stopped his car and said the ambulance will be at this corner in 1 min. We both got out and sure enough ,the ambulance showed up and got me to the hospital. 

With all these stories, one of the things that we all have in common is that we can not remember his face, not even my mom who talked to him. She said it's like her memory was wiped out. I have a very small memory of his face, his eyes were blue. Not just the iris, but the whole thing as blue. For some reason , it did not scare me.

Legend of Zelda is one of the best, most successful video game franchises in history. It is also one of my favourite games 

My theory is that Link is fact not a mute. He has in fact been talking to you the whole time. Who do I mean by you, I mean YOU, the player. 

What made me think of something so like this ? The same thing that has bothered me ever since playing A Link to the Past. When you first find the [magic mushroom the caption that comes up is ""This mushroom smells like sweet rotten fruit...""] ( http://i.imgur.com/G10hnej.png) and in the lost woods when you pick up a fake [Master Sword, the caption that comes on is ""This is it! The master sword... ... .. No it can't be , to bad""] (http://i.imgur.com/pw9KBf7.jpg)

These are not just some random narrations. This is Link telling you , the player what he is smelling and holding. He is describing it to you. He is saying this out loud for you to hear. 

So at this point your thinking to yourself ""Okay Drewgarr, you just choose some random scenes and are trying to make it a thing, so tell me more"" 

Have you ever noticed that every time links finds a weapon or item the caption always starts with [""you found"" or ""you got"" while holding them up] (http://i.imgur.com/F55a3pT.jpg). Well he is showing you what he found. He is making an effort for you to see it. He also is describing to you what he found. Like watching a movie , if a character finds an item he is going to describe it to give insight into the item. 

""Hmm, okay Drewgarr what else you got to support your theory, cause so far it's just circumstantial at best and I am not yet convinced of anything you have said""

Alright. How is this. What makes me think that Link is aware of you as the player? That you are controlling him. That he needs to communicate with you? So aside from describing what he smells and see's , there needs to be a way to describe what you as the player can not see. Things that would only make sense for Link to break the 4th wall and straight up tell you something. Got me there. That would mean Link would need say something directly to the player, not a thought because we can not hear Links thoughts (more on that later). Link needs to straight up say, ""hey I found something you could not see"" Damn, oh well I guess this theory is disproven.... Of course it isn't. There is one moment in the whole Zelda universe where Link straight up talks to you. He isn't talking to someone,he is telling YOU something. In Zelda 2: adventure of Link (I can hear you rolling your eyes ) Link is in a house and finds a mirror. This isn't a ""here Link take this mirror"" or ""Use this mirror..."" moment. Nope Link says [""I found a mirror under the table""] (http://i.imgur.com/1MSIXvt.png)  
Who is link talking to? Well if you do not believe that Link isn't talking to you , you have to at least give me the Link isn't a mute. He is 100% saying ""I found a mirror"" I, as in ""I"" Link of Hyrule. What is more interesting is the second part. ""Under the table"" Link is describing where he found it. Who is Link describing this to, why he is Describing it to the player. The reason for this is because Link is aware that this is out of the players field of vision. To just go one step further. In the same game, every time links finds an item. There is no describing the item, [Link just holds it up] (http://i.imgur.com/T8ORpUf.png). Showing you what he found. Well, I think the reason is because Link is expecting the player to know what the item is. How? Oh by the [instruction guide](http://www.digitpress.com/library/manuals/nes/Zelda%20II%20-%20The%20Adventure%20of%20Link.pdf). The reason he holds it up is you ,the player can see what he found and cross reference it with the guide. Well that would mean the game was meant to break to 4th wall in some way and be designed to have input from the player. Well I can actually prove that this was the intent of the game. [In the Japanese version of the NES (the famicom) the 2nd controller was out fitted with a speaker](http://i.imgur.com/l2DRXWx.png) The function of this speaker is so that players can interact with the game. One of the creatures in the game is a called a ""Pols voice"" The instruction guide clearly says [""Pols voice hate loud noises""](http://i.imgur.com/pzoEZRU.png). Why am I telling you this? The reason is that you can yell into the famicoms controller speaker and it would kill the pols voice instantly. Why is this relevant? To me , it proves the design of the game was originally intended to be interactive with the game , outside of controlling Link. That in fact there is a 4th wall element in the game. 

""Drewgarr, you might be onto something,but answer me this. Why do you say that Link saying ""I Found"" or describing things not just his thoughts?""

It's The same reason why I think Link doesn't talk back to people. Throughout the whole franchise , there has never been an exchange that went like ""Take this sword"" and Link respond ""You crazy old men why do I need a sword, wtf I'm like 10""  or why when a character explains something to you , you are given the option to ""repeat"" or ""got it"". See this is not Link answering directly to the character , this is Link asking YOU if you understand. Other times when there is no choice to be made, he just does it. For example, at the end of Ocarina , Zelda tells him to give her the ocarina. He just does as he is told. There is no ""Okay"" or ""Give her Ocarina"" Link simply does. There is no internal monologue about his feelings. Again to just take it one step further. In link the past, Link has telepathic abilities. [He talks to the town elder Sahasrala via telepathy. We never in fact see link respond , even through telepathy. He is told ""Rescue the Maidens"" and off he goes] (http://i.imgur.com/xgGsUZ4.png). There is no dialogue of his inner thoughts. So what does this mean. It means that Link doesn't share his inner thoughts with the player and that Link is capable of understanding language. It also dispels any ""Link is a mute because he was born like that "" because he would then reply via telepathy. So that means that the times when Link said ""This isn't the master sword"" or ""this fruit smells sweet"" he isn't thinking this. He is saying this to YOU the player. 

""Umm Drewgarr, in later Zelda games..."" Look I don't know. I have not played past Ocarina. I just wrote a whole fan theory talking to myself and answering my own questions in the 3rd person. Like I am anticipating what your going to say and pointing out things. Sort of what the Legend of Zelda are. Someone being guided to an end result, only taking time to break the 4th wall when they need to further explain what he see's

TL:DR ; Link is not a mute and constantly breaks the 4th wall to tell the player what he has found. 

Edit. Some missing words

One of my favourite Disney movies of all time has to be the emperors new groove and one of my favourite gags in the movie is chase scene where Yzma and Kronk are chasing Cuzco and Pacha.
At the end of the scene, there is a throwaway gag in where Yzma and Kronk are struck by lightening and fall into the water, allowing Cuzco and Pacha to take the lead make it to the palace seemingly before Yzma and Kronk. When they arrive , they are surprised to discover that Yzma and Kronk beat them to her lair. What makes it funny is that Yzma and Kronk themselves do not know how they beat them and Kronk pulling out a map of the chase and saying that it doesn't make sense.
My theory is that the reason Yzma and Kronk made it to the lair before Cuzco and Pacha is because of ""the lever"".
To get to Yzma's secret lair, a lever has to be pulled. Switching the wrong lever opens a trap door that leads to a river filled with alligators. It's from there that it is a relatively short trip back to the lair from the river. This is proven by when Kronk hits the wrong lever and Yzma yells ""wrong lever"" sending her to the river. She then emerges still wet with an alligator at her heels. The fact she is still wet and the gator following her shows that it is a short trip back to the lair entrance. Furthermore , Cuzco falls victim to the same ""wrong lever "" and he emerges from the river still wet with a alligator nipping at his heels to the lair entrance . So with that said , it's safe to say their is a shortcut or quick way back to the lair from the river.
As mentioned above, during the chase scene Kronk and Yzma try to glide over the gorge that connects the palace and country side to where there is normally a bridge but it was destroyed by Cuzco and Pacha. It is when they are in the air that are stuck by lighting and fall into the river as reflected on the chase map. What's interesting is that the river they fall into is the same river that connects to the lair. Furthermore , this seems to be the same river that is near the palace below the one bridge. Also, this river also happens to contain alligators , just like the river that the trap the wrong lever leads to.
So what I think happened is after their fall into the river, they simply used the shortcut to get to the lair and that how they beat Cuzco and Pacha to the lair.

With that said, I just want to share some thoughts and my observation of this whole Sanders vs Clinton. So please spare me a few mins. 

First off , why are Americans considering Hilary Clinton as a viable candidate? Let's face if 8 years ago she was not good enough to win the Democratic nomination so why would she be a good choice now? 

What Sanders has said about the middle class and how unfair it is that so few have so much and they want more is true. It's not an opinion, it's a fact numbers don't lie. Big banks and big  companies seem to want to back Clinton. She seems like the type of person they want, someone who will keep them rich and not share with the rest of the world. Sanders wants to give people back their lives and revive the American Dream. It appears to me Clinton will keep the rest of America in a perpetual nightmare of debt. Her track history with her friends at the big banks seem to me she doesn't have the interest of all of America as her priority. Honestly ,she strikes me of more of a republican. It's sad that I think that trump is more honest then Hilary  

Healthcare. This is probably where I think Bernie will have the most difficulty. Hilary is correct in saying that this is just an idea and Bernie has no real plan. Yes, I am aware of what he wants to do and here he will get the money for it. I just think that every senator and law maker is going to push back so hard to not let universal health care come into play. 

Experience. This is a no brainer. It's actually boggles my mind as to why Clinton is even a contender here. Sanders has been a senator for what now, 40+ Years. He's been active in congress and such. Hilary has what , a few years under her belt as Secretary of State or something. 

Lastly and most importantly I think the reason people are getting behind sanders , especially young people is because he is promising a better tomorrow where the problems of today will be no more. He paints the picture of a future where school won't bankrupt you , health benefits and parental leave , bringing America on par with the rest of world in terms of social services. 

So in conclusion , I tell you my American friends that as a Canadian you do not know the freedom that comes with knowing that there are social services and programs designed to help you. That getting injured won't mean having to sell your house or pay a huge bill for basic health services. To have the freedom to start a family and know you can be there for your child. 

It's sort of ironic that the oldest person to run for president is the one who is more in touch with the younger people.

Last time I was this interested in American politics was 8 years ago when Obama was campaigning for the Dem nomination against Hilary.  Being from Canada but raised in the USA for my early life I can 100% appreciate Bernie Sanders  stance on universal health care. In fact it's painful to hear stories about elderly people having to sell their homes to cover medical bills. That should never ever have to happen. I can also appreciate that he wants to tax the wealthy more and close the gap between the middle class and wealthy. I say this because in Canada we are facing a similar issue. 

So now that my view is out of the way, here is my question. what has changed in 8 years that the democrats would want Hilary? If she was not cut out to be the democratic candidate then, why would she be now? I understand that 8 years is a long time to grow be mature and gain more experience, but her not having those traits 8 years ago was not the deal breaker. Maybe it's because I am not in America that I don't understand but it seems to me that if the Democratic Party didn't elect her then, why would they elect her now? Has she changed so much in 8 years and if so, can the Hilary of today beat the Obama of 8 years ago for the nomination or is it the same old thing?

1. In the season 1 finally, we see Barry Allen running through the speed force. In here we see such great things as legends of tomorrow the flash museum and of killer frost. I think we can all agree that these are all earth 1 &amp; 2 visions. We saw Joe taking in young Barry(earth 1), Barry's and his folks(earth 1) killer frost  (earth 2) legends  (earth 1 (2??) Flash museum  (earth 1&amp;2) and his mom's death  (earth 1). What we also saw was  [Barry in Jail] (http://imgur.com/JHV03qW). We know this isn't Earth 1 Barry as E1 Barry isn't jail. What we also see is he is talking to someone, assumed to be his father Henry Allen. What do we know, we know Earth 2 Barry is in, or will be in Jail. Also, the build of the guy he is talking to looks like it resembles zoom 

2. At the beginning of the season we see earth 2 rouges taking out their earth 1 counterparts. What we also have is Henry Allen suddenly departing from Central City around the same time. I think zoom found his earth 1 counterpart  (Henry Allen) and threatened him to leave, in an effort to maybe keep his earth 1 counterpart alive for the same reason Jay needed his earth 1 counterpart. I don't think zoom is a scientist so he might not know it works. Alternatively,  Zoom might have offed his earth 1 counterpart, posed as him and made up the fishing story to not attract attention. Either way, the writers have  done a good job in not mentioning his father at all. 

3. He wants Barry to get faster. So we know Zoom wants Barry to get faster, just not sure why? Well what if the reason he wants Barry to go faster is so he can change something in the past, present or future. Yes, Zoom is faster then Barry. We don't know if he can time travel though? What if he needs Barry speed to be able to time jump and correct what terrible thing happened to earth 2 Barry that put him in Jail. What if he needs Barry to up his speed so he can time jump in the future with him. We only know Barry can only jump into the past, not the future. So essentially, he needs earth 1 Barry to obtain a level of speed that he can steal so he can save someone. (Sound familiar)

4. Holding wells daughter in a prison. So this is more for irony, but the show writers love this. Wells said that he created zoom and it's his fault. Well we know Earth 2 wells is a bit of a dick. We also know Jay called him out on it and the particle accelerator. What if Wells is indirectly the reason Earth 2 Barry is in Jail? It would explain the irony of holding his daughter. 

TL:DR; Zoom is Earth  2 Henry Allen and needs Barry to gain enough speed to steal to travel into a point in time to clear or free  Earth 2 Barry from jail.

*Also, is zoom can time travel, why does he need Barry's speed? Reason could be so he can change a finite moment (Like E1 Barry's mom death) and can only be done with enough speed force.

Back around 2005, there was a bar in downtown Toronto that had live RAW events hosted by the guys from the LAW. The usually gave away some cool swag and memorabilia after the show. Well this one particular week they advertised that Jim and Coco would be at the bar joining us next week.

Cut to next week sure enough they are there. They don't really say much during the whole event. After the show, the guys from the LAW announce that they will be sticking around for a bit to come over and say hi. Awesome I think, I am hoping to get an autograph from the guys. Well about 20 min after the show I see Jim at the bar drinking alone and on and off talking to the bartender. Here's my chance I think to myself. I go up to Jim and say ""Hey Jim (Mr. Neidhart) long time fan. Can I buy you a beer?"" Jim nods and I ask the bartender to give him a beer and me one. Little did  I know Jim was drinking some $20 beer. I was kinda shocked but still, I got 2. One for me, one for him. The bartender pours the beers. At this point Jim had turned around from me, only turns to grab both beers. I turn to Jim and say ""Cheers"". You know, like most normal people. Well, Jim turns around , clanks my glass, says thanks and signs a picture. 

Just kidding, no what happened was something completely unexpected. He turns around and at the top of his lungs yells ""Fuck off"" turns around flips me off with his back turned. I was pretty shocked but whatever, it's not the first time I've been told to fuck off by a sports celebrity (and it wasn't the last for the night)

After my less then awesome experience with Jim, I start walking back to my table. On my way back, I see Coco beware just sitting at the table alone. He is just drinking water  on the table. Good I think  to myself, he isn't drunk. I walk up to him and say, ""hey Coco, huge fan. My brother and I really loved watching you in the ring"" what I got was probably one of the most awkward moments in my life. He didn't say anything, he just stared at me. He stared for a good 45 secs. He then got up and walked away from the table. 

Okay, I'm 0 for 2. Time to go home. Well on my way out, I pass by his table again and say, it was great seeing him there. Again he just stares, but this time he says ""Fuck....You..."" under his breath to me.

My first bit of evidence is in the very beginning of the movie. After Finn refuses to fire his weapon against the villagers there is a scene where our buddy Kylo Ren stops and notices him, senses him if you will. I theorize that the force was running through Finn at that moment , a surge of the force. 

Now with this mind, a surge or ""awakening "" of the force surging through Finn is what most likely helped break the First Order's brain washing or mental conditioning (which we know by Phasma telling Ren that he has never had or shown any signs of not being in line) which helped make Finn make the decision to help Poe and become a traitor to the first order. 

During the escape, Finn self admitting says that he was never flown or fired in a tie fighter to Poe. Well after a quick tutorial from Poe, Finn becomes an expert marksman (unlike most troopers ). Know who are naturals marksman and pilots? Force sensitive folks. A counter argument is that Finn most likely had this kind of training as a trooper. Well like I said before, he has said he had no idea what he was doing, and the cherry on the cake being what we found out about what Finn's position in the first order was sanitation. So unless he was using some crazy blasters to recycle computers Kylo Ren thrashed every time he stubs his toe, it is fair to say he didn't know what he was doing before. He was being guided by the force , unknowing to him. We then see Finn use his new found marksman skills in the escape with Rey. He himself says ""I'm getting pretty good at this."" 

Speaking of Rey, let's talk about their first meeting. We know that Finn first sees Rey getting attacked by some goons. Now, we know that storm troopers are programed to not feel empathy when a fellow trooper (I can't find the source ) falls in battle. So here is some girl he has never met , getting attacked and his reaction is to help her. He is drawn to her and as we find out later in the movie, she is force sensitive and force sensitive people are drawn to each other. 

Next I'll jump to the scene where the weapon destroys the Hosnian system. After watching the scene for the 2nd time, it gives a strong argument that Finn was in fact hearing the screams of those whose lives where being vanquished. This a trait of force sensitive people. 

Lastly , let me jump to Finn's natural ability to use a light saber. Let's start by analyzing the scene where he gets the light Saber from Maz. Now, we know Maz is not force sensitive but has knowledge of the force. I'm fact, when they were at the table, she started talking about closing your eyes and feeling the force. To me , it seemed she was directing this not Rey,but Finn. Finn who she just said has the eyes of someone who wants to run. Later she knew that the light Saber called to Rey and it belongs to Rey. When Rey refuses it, who does it she give to? Finn. Now why Finn? Why not Han who has connections to the rebels or her boyfriend Chewy who she obviously likes? She knows that only force sensitive people can use the light Saber. To further this, when the first order attacked and started leveling the place, Finn asks for a weapon and what he is told by Maz that he has one. The light Saber, the weapon of a Jedi. So here we have Maz, a thousand years old being with knowledge of the force, the empire and the Jedis handing and telling Finn that the weapon of the Jedis is his weapon to use. Not the weapon of a man who wants run away. Well Finn using the light Saber is natural, similar to how Rey is a natural just not as good. 

Lastly brings me to my final point about Finn's force sensitive powers. After we see our buddy Kylo Ren carry Rey into his ship and take her home like some creep, we see that Finn sees this. Next we see Finn talking to Leia and he tells her how to disrupt the weapon. He tells her that is where they took Rey. He felt where they took Rey, and being from sanitation there is no way he would know if that would actually work. All he knew is that he wanted to save Rey and knew where she was the same way Leia knew where luke was in cloud city at the end of episode 6.

Han brings this up to him and he says "" We will use the force"" to which Han hilariously replies ""that's not how the force works"". Well in the next scene we see something that I think a lot of us did not notice. We see Finn use the Jedi mind trick. Who does he use it on , no one else but his old boss Phasma. Now like I said before , Finn isn't as strong or force sensitive as Rey which is why Phasma was still talking trash, but she still lowered the shields. She was doing i think subconsciously, being guided by Finn's willingness to have her lower the shields. 

So there you have it. I apologize for my grammar and spelling as I thought of this as I was writing it.

TL:DR Finn is force sensitive because he natural marksman despite working only in sanitation. He is naturally drawn to Rey to the point he knew where Ren had taken her. He heard the screams of the Hosnian system being destroyed and is identified by Maz as someone who's weapon is the light Saber.",StarWars,Some proof Finn is somewhat force sensitive.

So unless he was using some crazy blasters to recycle computers Kylo Ren thrashed every time he stubs his toe, it is fair to say he didn't know what he was doing before.  He was being guided by the force , unknowing to him. We then see Finn use his new found marksman skills in the escape with Rey. He himself says ""I'm getting pretty good at this."" 

Speaking of Rey, let's talk about their first meeting. We know that Finn first sees Rey getting attacked by some goons. Now, we know that storm troopers are programed to not feel empathy when a fellow trooper (I can't find the source ) falls in battle. So here is some girl he has never met , getting attacked and his reaction is to help her. He is drawn to her and as we find out later in the movie,  she is force sensitive and force sensitive people are drawn to each other. 

Next I'll jump to the scene where the weapon destroys the Hosnian system. After watching the scene for the 2nd time,  it gives a strong argument that Finn was in fact hearing the screams of those whose lives where being vanquished. This a trait of force sensitive people. 

Lastly , let me jump to Finn's natural ability to use a light saber. Let's start by analyzing the scene where he gets the light Saber from Maz. Now, we know Maz is not force sensitive but has knowledge of the force. I'm fact, when they were at the table, she started talking about closing your eyes and feeling the force. To me , it seemed she was directing this not Rey,but Finn. Finn who she just said has the eyes of someone who wants to run.  Later she knew that the light Saber called to Rey and it belongs to Rey. When Rey refuses it, who does it she give to? Finn. Now why Finn?  Why not Han who has connections to the rebels or her boyfriend Chewy who she obviously likes? She knows that only force sensitive people can use the light Saber. To further this, when the first order attacked and started leveling the place, Finn asks for a weapon and what he is told by Maz that he has one. The light Saber, the weapon of a Jedi. So here we have Maz, a thousand years old being with knowledge of the force, the empire and the Jedis handing and telling Finn that the weapon of the Jedis is his weapon to use. Not the weapon of a man who wants run away. Well Finn using the light Saber is natural, similar to how Rey is a natural just not as good. 

Lastly brings me to my final point about Finn's force sensitive powers. After we see our buddy Kylo Ren carry Rey into his ship and take her home like some creep, we see that Finn sees this. Next we see Finn talking to Leia and he tells her how to disrupt the weapon. He tells her that is where they took Rey. He felt where they took Rey, and being from sanitation there is no way he would know if that would actually work. All he knew is that he wanted to save Rey and knew where she was the same way Leia knew where luke was in cloud city at the end of episode 6.

 Han brings this up to him and he says "" We will use the force"" to  which Han hilariously replies ""that's not how the force works"". Well in the next scene we see something that I think a lot of us did not notice. We see Finn use the Jedi mind trick. Who does he use it on , no one else but his old boss Phasma. Now like I said before , Finn isn't as strong or force sensitive as Rey which is why Phasma was still talking trash, but she still lowered the shields. She was doing i think subconsciously,  being guided by Finn's willingness to have her lower the shields. 

So there you have it. I apologize for my grammar and spelling as I thought of this as I was writing it.

TL:DR Finn is force sensitive because he natural marksman despite working only in sanitation. He is naturally drawn to Rey to the point he knew where Ren had taken her. He heard the screams of the Hosnian system being destroyed and is identified by Maz as someone who's weapon is the light Saber.",FanTheories,[Star Wars TFA] Finn is somewhat force sensitive SPOILERS,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/40960d/star_wars_tfa_finn_is_somewhat_force_sensitive/

It's not like he was some forgettable guy that went to high school with the main characters. He is the reason his parents met and guy who made Biffs life just a touch more difficult. After all , if your 3rd son looked like the guy you  went to high school with , you would definitely ask questions. So here goes my half brained theory as to why no one remembers him is because Marty never existed at this period in time in 1955 and because of this no one has memories of him.

So let me start with the people Marty encounters in his trip to 1955. First and foremost he encounters his whole immediate family  (George , Loraine grandparents and his baby jail bird uncle). Through his actions throughout BTF 1, he gets them to hook up, almost hooks up with his mom and tells them a cool name is Marty. Heck , he evens straight up tells them ""If your son accidentally sets the living room on fire take it easy on him"" that means that if and when young Marty does go all Pyro McFly, his parents would remember this specific warning from ""Calvin Klein ""

 Next he encounters his High School principle to which he says ""Man, did that Guy ever have hair? "" He became known to his HS principal in 1955 and 1985. Not much , but still a part of the theory.

Next he encounters Biff on several occasions, pretty memorable occasions non the less. He wrecks his car (twice) and see's him fly away via [motherfucking flying car] (http://imgur.com/5latcjR). That shit is pretty memorable. 

Lastly , he encounters Doc Brown. In BF1 , Marty has to convince Doc Brown via video tape and telling him about the [bruise on his head (2:49 mark)] ( https://youtu.be/SR5BfQ4rEqQ) that he is from the future and he needs his help to go back to 1985. Him and Doc have a jolly good adventure that is the whole movie.  

So now that I have (hopfully) proven that Marty would is memorable person to everyone he encounters, why is it no one remembers him or recognizes him in 1985? Because he did not exist , not even as an embryo or whatever and erasing people's memory of him is the universes way of preserving itself and not causing a massive universal catastrophe, as Doc says when [Marty tries to tell him about his future.] (https://youtu.be/A_NYQFCU0wI) 

In the above link , Doc says ""it's going to be hard to wait 30 years before I can talk to you about these events (around the 0:39 mark). Which means that Doc , who knows a thing or two about time travel fully expects to remember and talk to Marty in 1985. This means that if Doc can remember , why can't any of the people above remember him too. Especially Biff (poor Biff) .

I want to provide some proof and hopfully explain why Doc is not affected by this universal amnesia. To me, the answer is the [letter Marty leaves for Doc.] (http://www.bttfstore.com/bttf1_1985_letter.jpg)
It's not the content of the letter , but the letter itself. This is a hard proof of Marty being there, more importantly the letter itself has come in contact with the delorian and written by Marty.  Throughout the movie, Marty doesn't as much leave a dirty sock behind in 1985. If that is not enough proof, I theorize that anything or anyone that comes in contact with the Flux capacitor becomes covered or protected from the detrimental effects of time travel. Further any object that has been inside the delorian will always exist and be free from the effects of the ever changing timeline. So that's the reason the [Marty's family picture] ( http://orig02.deviantart.net/182e/f/2015/104/e/9/back_to_the_future_mcfly_children_photograph_by_jhwink-d8pq30q.jpg) still exists in 1955, [Old Man Biffs cane top] (http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/bttf/images/1/12/Biffscane.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20091012013649). Also, Old Man would also be exempted from this but he traveled back in time as an old man and his memories from 1955 to 2015 would still be intact. He only traveled back in time in 2015 to 1955 to give his younger self the sports almanac. Again proving that objects transported inside the delorian are exempt.

One scene that brought me to tears was that scene with rocky in the cemetery visiting Adrian and his recently dead best friend Paulie. The way he sat down and started reading the newspaper fucking got me. I almost couldn't hold it in. 

The second scene was when he got his ""bad news "". The way sly pulled off that look and made that comment about his wife killed me. It seemed so genuine.

This film was a roller coaster of emotions for me, especially the ending. Let me try my best to describe it and see if I could recapture those emotions. 

You have just spent the last 20 mins sitting on the edge of your seat watching Donnie fight with every fibre and inch of his being. The Camara focus's on [old rocky] (  https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ua7GtRcUbNg/maxresdefault.jpg) who at this point in the film you have grown such an emotional connection with. You can see and feel his concern for Donnie, the same way that [Mickey] (http://91.207.61.14/m/uploads/v_p_images/1982/01/1955_2_screenshot.png) cared for him when he was where Donnie is at now. It is at this moment you start thinking to yourself ""how are they gonna finish this movie?"" Is he going to win , lose or worse , go out like his [father] (https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bdx9geh510E/maxresdefault.jpg). Suddenly the bell rings and out of no where this [sound] (https://youtu.be/dGANPsZSEGE) starts playing and just like that your right back to being pumped up. You literally want to just jump out of your seat and cheer as loud as you want. No way on earth are you going to miss this last part of the fight. That not even God himself can come down and tell you you can't. You will fight even God and think you can win because this is how pumped up you are at this point. 

So many emotions in jus a few mins.",movies,After watching Creed tonight I can undoubtedly and happily say I shed some serious man tears twice in this movie [Spoilers inside],https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3uol6p/after_watching_creed_tonight_i_can_undoubtedly/

The movie is filled with great memories and scenes , but one thing that I think has been overlooked is that Kate Mccallister actually sold her soul to get home to Chicago .

First let me point out the scene [about the 1:04 mark] (https://youtu.be/FqK1N-Ba-Gs) 
Notice in this scene , just as she says ""If I have to sell my soul to the devil himself "" it is that we now see Gus take notice of Kate and approach her before the airline rep can further help her, in anyway possible. 

So what makes me think he is the devil, or a deal demon? My evidence is the location. The Scranton airport. More specifically the [crossroads located right at the airport] (http://imgur.com/c451qyA). At this point I want to point out the myth regarding the crossroads demon. [In a nutshell  it means that you can give an offering to the devil (in this case her soul) near a cross roads, the devil will show up and deliver it in exchange for the offering] (http://www.luckymojo.com/crossroads.html)

It is after this scene that Gus offers Kate a ride to Chicago ( to what she was willing to sell her soul for) to which she agrees to, essentially selling her soul. It is at this moment Gus smiles and  points out to his friend renting the van, showing her he is honoring his side of deal since she already put up her side (already agreed to a ride for her soul). It is here where she says ""Yes"" and the next scene we see that she did in fact [accept the ride] (http://imgur.com/RxwOGVx)

One last piece of evidence that I have found is Gus choice of instrument. Sure it's not as obvious as a fiddle, instead it's a [woodwind instrument] (http://imgur.com/J0izOpd). There are some references in the bible that one of the instruments are [ created and favored by the devil (my understanding at least) ] (https://blogs4brownback.wordpress.com/2007/08/10/woodwinds-are-the-instruments-of-satan/)

It is a bit of a silly one, but enough to make you think

I think the scene is a dream sequence. The dreamer , Finn is force sensitive and this is ""the force"" guiding him towards , or away from something. What made it stand out to me was  the isolation of the fight and Finns light sabre. It just seems out of place.

Well today, rather yesterday it happened to me that I just had to share with you all.

I go away on business trips about once every few months much to my wife's displeasure.  She is under the impression that being on a business trip consists of going out all night , drinking and impressing the local woman by saying ""I'm from out of town on business"" when in reality after the thrill of being in new city wears away, all you want to do is go back to your room and rest up for the next day. 

Going away on business trips there a few essentials one has carry. A Toothbrushe, a good book and an iPod for those long flights or car rides. Always having my iPod on me I download lots of songs and television shows  to keep me entertained during said trips. I dread the idea of forgetting my iPod but today was a day I wish I had.

So last night  after a particularly long and arguuees day I was extremely tired and was  so excited to get into my room , watch some nature of things and listen to my early 90's music. What I didn't do was call my wife to tell her goodnight, as I usually do. No problem I'll call her in the morning right? No big deal. I decide to pause my show and turn in for night. 

Fast forward to today.  I wake up late and have to rush to get ready or I would miss my flight home. I bring my phone (for reading while pooping ) and my iPod to listen to music while I shower. Just as I am in the shower my wife calls. I step out of the shower and answer the phone. My wife is on there, a little bit mad but more worried I didn't call.  I tell her the truth that I fell asleep and I was rushing to get ready. I also ask her to hang up the phone as I am all wet and my screen isn't as responsive. She agrees and I quickly after jump back into the shower and turn up my iPod. As I was jumping in , I swear I heard her say wait.  

Now this is the part where things go all ""sitcommy "". My wife didn't hang up so she heard me showering. What she also heard was me singing along to ""doin it"" by LL Cool J , specifically the part where the woman responding to LL Cool J's very rapey early 90's bang music. I guess the acoustics of the bathroom and me singing loudly made it sound more like a conversation  with music playing in the background. 

Well after my shower, I call back my wife and she isn't answering.  No big deal I'll call her when I'm at the airport. I turn on the TV and am greeted by a paused image of David Suzuki giving me a very judgmental look so  I call her back, no answer goes straight to VM after 2 rings ( she was hitting ignore). She must be busy,  I'll call her from Toronto. I land in Toronto and suddenly my phone explodes with FB messages saying happened,  her sister saying she never really trusted me and a message from my wife asking how old is she and why did I cheat ?

Now here I am, in a plane , confused as fuck as to what happened. I off board the plain and instantly call my wife. She picks up with a ""Fuck off"" and hangs up. Well I guess I'm paying $100 for a cab home. 

I get home and after much pleading to talk, she finally tells me to get into the car so she can tell me what she heard (she didn't want her family to hear us talk). That she heard me showering with some girl , and how I was being rough. At this point I had not yet pieced together what happened.  I straight up told her she must be mistaken. That I would never cheat. She then says"" let me see your phone "" . Sure no problem. She goes through my phone and only finds proof that I have gotten pretty good at Pokémon. She then asks to see my iPod. My iPod? Okay sure whatever. She opens it up and goes through the pics, iMessages and whatever else. Nothing. I tell her I can prove I am not cheating , I just don't know how. Suddenly , like a sign from God or something,  Doin it comes on through the car speakers. She looks at me and says ""that's the girl"" 

At that very moment, we both realize that when she turned on my iPod , it auto connected to the Bluetooth speakers of the car under the auto play function. Needless to say, she felt a tad silly. All in all, we got a good story to tell .",tifu,TIFU by singing along to LL Cool J,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3o9sna/tifu_by_singing_along_to_ll_cool_j/

I should preface this by noting this happened a few years ago when I was working at my old job.

The setting; late 2000's. Flip and slider phones were all the craze. People had to use T9 to text and data was unlimited (slow AF) and cheap. Now cut it me; a lowly video game shop worker with an ego, very little work ethic  and an attitude. My boss; great church going type but gullible (so I thought) with a heart of gold.

Now that I've described the setting I'll tell you how I royally messed up.  One long Canada I was schedule to work the whole weekend and holiday, but had plans to go camping with friends.   My other co-worker had the weekend off and was not willing to trade it off, no matter how much I pleaded.  The only other option was to ask my boss Mike to work that weekend  but I knew he was busy that weekend with church stuff. I was screwed and couldn't go camping. Bummed out, I call my friend Mark (names will be important later ) to tell him the bad news. As soon as he picks up the phone, his first words are ""Drewgarr you are going to want to ride my dick for this. You know that girl you like, the one so easy she makes the library on legendary look possible? Well she is going to be be there and she is asking for you. So what did you call for?"" Me, filled with a raging boner rage told him "" ughhh, just saying it's still on"" then hung up the phone like a 12 year old girl ghost calling her crush for the 10th time. 

Now here I am with a dilemma,  do I run the risk of getting fired for getting 20 secs of sex? (I'm realistic about my abilities ) The answer is simple , I am an adult , I have responsibilities and I shouldn't be dealing with easy girls. I am in my early 20s , I have to stop thinking about just having fun and be responsible and set a good example for my kid sister.

So about 10 mins later I call my boss and tell him that I can't come in. He said ""Drewgarr, unless your dieing or someone has died your coming in"" this is when I come up with this brilliant idea;kill of a family member that lives in my home country. I deepen my voice , put on my best sad man  impression and tell him a close family member passed away in Peru and I am going to travel to the states to be with my family. My boss with obvious regret, genuinely tells me ""I'm so sorry to hear that, please be with your family and message me if you need more time off"" 

Now with a clear pass and clear conscience I start packing to go camping and tell my folks to not answer of my work or boss calls. 

Cut to day 2 of partying and drinking like a some kind of repressed Viking , the girl of my dreams shows up , no other then Ms Bulbasaur  (I call her that because the easiest choice I had to make was not choosing Bulbasaur, also I have shit taste ) As soon as she see's me she runs up to me and hugs , kiss's and greets the boys with a quick high hive. Giggity Giggity right ? 

Cut to 45 mins later, it's about 3 and both of us are drunk of vodka , beer and some kind of rubbing alcohol so we decide to go to a tent. Me being a the genius I am, forgot I had a tent for one. Then I remember  my friend Marc has a double. I text him and say ""Marc, out of your tent. I'm going bang this braud."" No answer. I text again ""Marc you shit , tell me when the tents clear. This chick is teasing so hard, I'm about to spiderman in my pants "". Again , no answer. I text one more time ""Marc I took the weekend off and lied to my boss just for this."" Get your shit together."" Again no answer. About 5 mins I get a text alert. I quickly pull out and my phone and see its from Marc saying "" you alive , where are you ?"" Really upset I call him and start bitching him out saying ""dude , stop playing games. I've text you like 4 times for the last hour. Wtf "" he replies and tells me he has not received a text. He says to resend the message. I do so, I resend them. Still nothing , he doesn't get them. About 5 mins later ,he tells me where he is and we meet up. 

Marc is now freaked out because if he isn't get text , that means his gf is not able to get a hold of him. I decide to try out the picture message and send a pic of me in front of the camp fire I took earlier and nope nothing. 2 mins later , I get a text message. It's from my boss Mike. All the message says ""it's one thing to lie about a dead relative , it's another to brag about it. See you when your back ""

That's when it hits me. I've been texting Mike my boss the whole time.  

Afterwards , when I got back I didn't get fired but was relagated to working the bitch shifts. Oh and the girl, well after she heard marc had a 2 person tent , she joined him. I ain't or wasn't mad. I will say , this humbled me and I learned my lesson.  Not the lesson of lying or sleeping with easy girls. The lesson is , namen your boss on your contact list ""xxBos5xx"" so you don't accidently send them a drunk message 

Tl:Dr lied about a family member dying to get out of work for skanky tail and cheap booze. Texted my boss instead of my friend a full confession",tifu,TIFU by killing of a family member,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3mud49/tifu_by_killing_of_a_family_member/

I am currently on holiday in the Dominican Republic and I got to visit Old Santo Domingo today. While there ,  all I could think about was uncharted. 

First of,  the place was attacked by none other then Sir Francis Drake who took over the city and after a few weeks left after they city paid him a ransom. What is interesting is the rumours around it. He originally wanted 100k but settled on 25K. In the days he was negotiating a settlement  , he sent soldiers to look for the old Christopher Columbus house. Rumor has it that Columbus  hid something like 10% of the Spanish treasure that was claimed by the Spanish crown in the new world.

This bother the people of the DR and he refused to give it back to the country  and because of that was jailed by the governor at the time and was sent home back to Spain. Rumor has it that he charted a secret expedition back to DR where he took his loot and hid it. He only told his son Diego , who was living here at the time. This info is  what Sir Drake was looking for , and rumor has it he didn't find that's why he cut his losses and left. There is also a monument now to Chris Columbus here, where  rumor is that Chris Columbus body is buried here. 

With this info  I can totally picture Nathan Drake trying to find this treasure , sneaking into the old Colombus house (which is under heavy guard ) going to the burial spot of Columbus looking for more info and of course a link to what Drake actually found.

This goes against one particular scene , rather a throw away line which when I think about it, it makes perfect sense 

The scene is when MP asks them to remember the elevator. They are all frustrated and summer says ""just pee your pants like me"" and ""at least when I'm gross, I'm gross on purpose"".that is an UNPLEASANT memory.  The scene than ends with cousin vinny saving them. 

The reason this stands out is because in all the other memories or flashbacks,  there is no other moment where there is something unpleasant in the memory, regardless of how it ends. 

With that being said, we can now flash forward to the ending where all the parasites are dead. This is where Mr.Poopypants inserts his a memory into the family about him getting shot (unpleasesnt) and than his recovery (pleseant) he gets out of the house and invades our own memories , thus the intro where we see him.

TL:DR Mr. Poopyhole is smart enough to know the limitations of his powers so he insertes a bad moment into a pleasant memory to escape. ",rickandmorty,Mr.Poopyhole theory.

Me: okay, do you two also use it for Facebook, YouTube streaming or other media.

Mikey: Do you even game bro? Why are you two interuppting me when I'm playing online 

Me: it seems there is a misunderstanding about you connecting to WiFi is your the Internet connection and racking up your mom's bill

Mikey: haha. Are you dumb? WiFi isn't Internet. Mom he is a moron. I bet you he is like 40 living in his mom's basement. He probably is into my little pony and doesn't have a gf. He is so dumb. I probably make more money then he does. Mr tech guy do you have a gf? I do and your stupidness is interrupting our game date. Bye Mr smart. Here is my mom

Cust: okay

after 20 min of guiding her into the ui of the router, we disabled the wifi

One could argue that the 5 separated from captain Ginyu,  but that would not make sense because they would not still be calling themselves the Ginyu force. 

The other idea idea I had was that they got separated because of the time of death. I cut that theory because Burter, Guldo and Recoome all got killed by Goku and Vegeta, then it wasn't for sometime that Jace and then ginyu fell. Jeice being in king Kai planet kill this right away so I am left with one last option. 

Captain Ginyu isn't with his team because his original form does not have the energy level to maintain his form in the afterlife .in the dB universe, it is shown that only high level individuals can keep their form in the afterlife,  as seen by the thousands of spirit clouds in king Yama office. I theorize that ginyu's original form was so weak that he needed to keep changing bodies to reach the level he did.  When be was killed , his ""spirit"" took the form of his original body and that form could not join his team . But drewgarr, what if that purple form of Ginyu is the form he was born with ? My rebut is simple , Jeice. Jeice knew about the captains body snatch technique which points to get fact that he has used it before.

Some background,  this is me dealing with a customer with a cell phone 

Me: thanks for calling tech, how can I help you Google something you could have done on your own today?

Cust : My phone won't stay on. Fix it, I have important emails I need to see.

Me: sounds good. Let's start with your account and the type of phone you have.

Cust;  I don't have time to tell you .I make to much money per hour to have to go into details. Do your job and fix it

**okay, it's one of these calls. Time to lower expectations of a smart client**

Me: I need to know the type of phone so I can fix it. Is a Samsung , iPhone or Nokia? 

Cust : yeah.........

Me:......

Cust: yeah it is. Come fix it, or should I bill you for my time?

**at this point I slowly realize I am dealing with someone with the case of stupids**

Me: let's start by removing the battery and then turning it back on

Cust; how do I do that?  Is it hard ? Where is the battery ?

Me : it's on the back of the phone I believe , if I knew the exact model I can help you further.  Try removing the back cover first.  

Cust : I don't have the tools to take out the back cover here . Have you not connected to my phone remotely yet? I shouldn't have to tell you how to do your job 

**okay,  this might be a case of advanced stupid**

Me; you don't need tools to remove the back cover.  Is it possible you have an iPhone?  Is there an apple on the back?

Cust;  it's a macintosh apple yes. (Oddly specific )

Me; okay. Hold the home and power button together and tell me if you see the apple logo come up?

Cust;  i see it now. And now it's dark. Now is the apple logo again.  What's going on?

Me: hmm.  Possible your phone might need to be restored . Are you near your computer ?

Cust;  yes. 

Me; okay I need you to log into iTunes. ...

Cust: ARE YOU STUPID? HOW CAN I DO THAT?  I ONLY HAVE 2 HANDS 

**no. This isn't real. This man must have a masters degree in applied stupid**

Me: sir , you have to let go of the buttons when the apple logo appears . Good news is we might not have to restore your phone. 

Cust; you have to be more specific . Tell me how to press the button the way you need me to. I don't know what special technical mumbo jumbo you need from me. Just fix this. I already lost $3 from my time with you 

**okay. Time to wrap up big money here and get off the phone**

Me : hold both buttons please and let go when you see the apple logo.

Cust; it's stuck on the apple logo. I don't have time for this. If it helps , i see something that says 16GB and some small letters .

**noooo,  this man is holding his phone backwards . No way. This is an example in a dissertation for a PhD in applied stupid**

Me: sir I believe you have it backwards . Can you flip the phone around please. 

Cust; oh there it is . Good . Hopefully I don't  have this problem again. Goodbye

One day, I had the unfortunate task of having to clean out an employee computer that was let go due to misconduct. As I went to his desk, I picked up his tower and heard loud rattling noise. Freaked out thinking I broke something, I quickly took it to my desk to see what it was and if I could repair it. When I open it up, I don't see anything out of place. I then look closer and I notice an hdd plastic flap seems broken. When I remove it, inside I see a flask. Being a green horn, I report it to my boss who then calls up the former employee and asks ""we found your flask, is it whisky or rum?"" After a small convo, he grabbed it and started drinking right then and there.

Me; blah blah tech support, fuck you want? (Not really said, but how I wish)

Cust: I have an iPhone. It's stuck on a screen. Can you help

Me: sure. Just hold the button on the top right corner and the big circle button on the screen for 10 secs. Should restart it.

Cust; I can't do that. There is no circle button, just an oval. 

Me; hmm, are you sure you have an iPhone then,sounds like it might be a Samsung phone.

Cust: yes a Samsung iPhone 

**common mistake, no problem. It's not bourbon time yet**

Me: okay. Let's just try this then. Take the battery out of the phone please and then back in. In the meantime please give me your account info.

Cust; no, I was told by my grandson to not give away personal info on the phone. I trust him. He's a hacker. He hacks people all the time on the Nintendo  x-ray 360 ( I'm sure it was Xbox 360)

Me: okay, fair enough. You called us though, and if your unsure about us. Please Google the number you called and you will our company.

Cust: what's Google. How do I buy it?

**forget Bourbon, this calls for rubbing alcohol**

Me: if you go to a computer and launch the Internet. It's the website you search for things. 

Cust; I think I should get my grandson, the hacker I told you about. He's on my 11 but he's such a good hacker he tells me all the time. Heck, if I message him now. I'm sure he can hack you from his phone. 

Me; If you feel more comfortable with him sure. Now if you are unsure about the battery issue and how to remove it. I'll guide you to Google and then to a website that will show how to do it. 

Cust : please 

**after what seemed like a herculean task, we got to Google and the Samsung support page, as well as got his account info**

Me; we're all set here. Anything else?

Cust. Yes your name please as well where I'm calling?

Me; sure it's drewgarr  (first name) and I'm in drewgarr city.

Cust; one sec. Oh wow. I just Google you and there you are. You have a very pretty wife and look there are your brothers and siblings. I feel like a hacker now.

Me; .......... it's probably not me. I have a common name and no siblings or wife. Have a good day. (He did find me though, I created a ""hacker"")

Me: welcome to tech, how can I help you.

Cust; my laptop isn't connecting to the Internet. Can you help me?

Me; of course. Ma'am did you recently receive a new modem from us and if you have, have you already plugged it in. 

Cust; Yes I did and now it's not recognising my WiFi. Does the new modem have a different password

**so far a normal tech call, didn't think things would take a turn for the stupid**

Me; on the back of the new modem you will see a label, under it you will a line saying WEP. Please enter what says beside it. (The device in question is a cellular wireless Hotspot, so isp doesn't have the default WEP)

Cust; I did. It's not accepting it. It says wrong password. 

Me; Make sure your entering it correctly and it's case sensitive. Please tell me exactly what your entering. 

Cust; I am typing in ""WEPxxxxxxx"" 

Me; no Ma'am. Don't enter the word WEP. Just whatever is after it. 

Cust: okay: still not working. I am entering the space, then the what's written down. 

Me: no ma'am, just start with the first character, ignoring the space after WEP 

Cust; you don't seem to know what your doing. Let me speak to a supervisor. 

Me; I don't think that's nessessary, if you just read me what you see, I'll help you out. 

Cust: no you don't seem very intelligent, supervisor now.

**this point I give up and call up a supervisor. Sadly, the wait to speak to one was long so I had to go back and refresh the client**

Me: ma'am sorry about the wait to speak to a super.... (I get cut off)

Cust; good I am talking to a supervisor. I have to tell you your last agent was kind of dumb and shouldn't be employed. No wonder people hate calling tech support when they have issues when you have people like that working. Anyway,do you know my problem. Please tell me how to fix it.

Me;....ummmm, Start with the first character after WEP, ignoring the space.

Cust; okay it works. Your much better then the other guy. You should fire him and you should get a pay raise. Goodbye

Working for a company that offers 24 hour tech support, it's not very uncommon that my department gets all the misc. and misrouted calls. One early weekend morning (6 am) I am starting my shift and 1st call is a woman crying, panicking and screaming  about her computer. This is how the conversation went down;
ME; welcome to tech support, how can I help you.

Cust; you people are making my computer make Loud noises, make it stop right now or I'm going to sue you

ME; ma'am, I can assure we are not doing anything like that, but let's get to the bottom of this. Is it loud noises like music coming from the speakers or straight from your tower?

CUST; I'm not answering you until you make the noises go away, I'll sue you personally because your not doing your job

ME; ma'am, on your computer do you have any open Web pages or videos playing? 

Cust; Are you deaf, I just told you I'm not answering that? Hear just listen to it

**she put the phone up to tower and it was a particularly loud fan**

ME; okay, it sounds like it's your fan. Go ahead and shut it down.

Cust: what does my AC have to do with this? You want me to start sweating and torture me so I'll answer your questions? You are working my landlord aren't you? You are trying to get me to move, well you can tell Pirak I'm not moving. You Indians all stick together.

ME: ma'am, I'm talking about your computer fan. Your computer has a small fan inside and that seems to be the problem. If your unsure how to shutdown the computer I can help you.

Cust; NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!! It's my right to have a  fan. Your not shutting down my business. My computer is my business. You fix that noise now or I'll sue you for everything half way across the world

ME: okay ma'am, first off I'm in Canada. Two, you called me complaining about the noise. If you don't want to follow my recommendations, no problem. I'll end the call now.

Cust; don't you dare. Great now the baby is awake. How do I make the noise go away, tell me now.

ME; just unplug your computer and take it to a computer tech. They will fix it. 

**this point, she puts the phone down and I hearing her  yell at the computer telling it to be quiet and threatens to unplug it. That was then followed by 2 min of her yelling about how she couldn't find where to unplug it from**

CUST; I can't unplug it. It will stop my microwave. I need to eat

Me. Okay, sounds like you might have it plugged into a power bar. On the back of the computer, go ahead and unplug all the cables. 

CUST; your trying to starve me. Your a monster. I'm never giving you my business ever again.

**she then ""tries"" to hang up the phone. I still hear her in the back yelling at her computer**
