Some of the policies include his plans to repeal and replace Obamacare, build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border (and having Mexico pay for it), deport undocumented immigrants, put Hillary Clinton in jail and, of course, temporarily ban Muslims from entering the U.S.

That is based on a misunderstanding of biology, social constructs, and anatomy. It is a simplistic and outdated understanding of biology to perpetuate some very dangerous ideas about trans people. You are just continuing to see them as something other than real men or women.

The thing people like you want to cling to the most is the idea that sex is an immutable, universal biological reality that is therefore easy to categorize. You argue that that sex is an unchanging biological fact, and that therefore their sex is still male or female.

“Biological sex” is actually a social construct, those who say that it is not often have to argue about what it entails. Some say it’s based on chromosomes (of which there are many non-XX/XY combinations, as well as diversity among people with XY chromosomes), others say it’s genitals or gonads (either at birth or at the moment you’re talking about), others say it’s hormone levels (which vary widely and can be manipulated), still others say it’s secondary sex characteristics like the appearance of breasts, body hair and muscle mass (which vary even more). Some say that it’s a combination of all of them. Now, this creates a huge problem, as sex organs, secondary sex characteristics and hormone levels aren’t anywhere close to being universal to all men or women, males or females.

Those who claim that sex is determined by chromosomes must not realize that sex is assigned at birth not by chromosomes, not even by gonads, but by genitals. In fact, the vast majority of us never learn what our sex chromosomes are. Sex isn’t something we’re actually born with, it’s something that doctors or our parents assign us at birth. So if sex is determined by genitals, they must be clearly binary and unchangeable, right? Wrong. Genitals can be ambiguous at birth and many trans people get gender confirmation surgery to change them. Neither chromosomes nor genitals are binary in the way that “biological sex” defenders claim they are, and the vast majority of measures by which we judge sex are very much changeable.

While it is true that gender and sex are different things, and that gender is indeed a social construct, sex isn’t the Ultimate Biological Reality that transphobes make it out to be. There’s nothing intrinsically male about XY chromosomes, testosterone, body hair, muscle mass or penises. If an alien civilization found earth, they wouldn’t look at a person with a penis and say “Oh, that must be a male, sex based on genitalia is the One Universal Constant.” Sex, like gender, is indeed socially constructed and can be changed.

If sex isn’t the All Mighty Binary Universal Constant that some people think it is, why do they place so much importance on it? The easy answer is that it gives them an excuse to misgender and exclude trans people. They can pretend they’re just standing up for science, but they’re really just saying that trans women aren’t fully women and that trans men aren’t fully men. People need to start learning about what sex really is and what social constructs really are. ",2016-11-15 19:44:18+00:00,da1ok5x,5.0,t1_da12prx,36503.0,Christianity

113,"&gt;  I guess my problem is more the fact that I don't think transitioning is Biblical

May I ask what that opinion is based on? People tend to define sex in a binary way — either wholly male or wholly female — based on physical appearance or by which sex chromosomes an individual carries. But while sex and gender may seem dichotomous, there are in reality many intermediates.

 Understanding this complexity is critical; misperceptions can affect the health and civil liberties of those who fall outside perceived societal norms. Society has categorical views on what should define sex and gender, but the biological reality is just not there to support that.
 
Even at the most basic physical level, there is a spectrum between male and female that often goes unrecognized and risks being obscured by stigma. 

A growing body of research is showing how biology influences gender expression, sexual orientation and gender identity — characteristics that can also fall outside of strict, socially defined categories. Toy-preference tests, a popular gauge of gender expression, have long shown that boys and girls will typically gravitate to toys that are stereotypically associated with their gender (cars and guns for boys, for instance, or plush toys for girls). While one might argue that this could be the by-product of a child’s environment — parental influence at play or an internalization of societal norms — Melissa Hines, a former UCLA researcher and current professor of psychology at the University of Cambridge, in England, has shown otherwise. In 2008, she demonstrated that monkeys showed the same sex-based toy preferences as humans — absent societal influence.

Sexual orientation (whether one tends to be attracted to men or women) has also been shown to have biological roots. Twin studies and genetic linkage studies have shown both hereditary patterns in homosexuality (attraction to one’s own sex), as well as genetic associations with specific parts of the genome. And while gender identity — the sense one has of oneself as being either male or female — has been harder to pinpoint from a biological standpoint, efforts to understand what role biology may play are ongoing.",2016-11-15 19:35:57+00:00,da1o4oq,3.0,t1_da0z2s6,46734.0,Christianity

116,"Biology isnt sin, biological phenomena don’t necessarily fit into human-ordained binary categories. So while humans insist that you’re either male or female – that you have either XY or XX sex chromosomes – biology begs to differ.

Divergence from the normal number of X and Y chromosomes, called sex chromosome aneuploidy (SCA), accounts for approximately half of all chromosomal anomalies in humans, with a total frequency of 1:400 (Passarge, 1995). Aneuploidy occurs in at least 5% of all pregnancies, which is a relatively high frequency, and is the most commonly recognized chromosome abnormality in humans (Hassold and Hunt, 2001). Below are some examples:

*Turner Syndrome*: This disorder, also referred to as monosomy X (45X), occurs only in girls and women when the X chromosome is totally or partially missing. Although 45X is a frequent chromosomal anomaly, Turner syndrome is rare, with a live-birth frequency of 1:3,000 (Hook and Warburton, 1983). Affected individuals experience abnormal growth patterns, heart defects, and certain learning disabilities; they are short in stature; generally lack prominent female secondary sexual characteristics; and are sterile—features that in some individuals lead to social adjustment problems (The Mayo Clinic, 2016c).

*XXX Females*: Women with three X chromosomes (47XXX), referred to as Triple X syndrome, or trisomy X, experience normal development of sexual traits and are fertile. Affected individuals are usually taller than average and have slender builds and no severe phenotype, but may have a slight learning disorder (The Mayo Clinic, 2016b, U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2016). The frequency of women obtaining an extra X chromosome is approximately 1:1,000.

*Klinefelter Syndrome*: Klinefelter syndrome (47XXY or XY/XXY mosaic) is the most pervasive sex chromosomal anomaly (Klinefelter et al., 1942), affecting approximately 1 in 600 males (Nielsen and Wohlert, 1990). Males with Klinefelter syndrome carry two or more X chromosomes resulting in abnormal development of the testis, leading to hypogonadism and infertility (Bojesen et al., 2004). Affected males have incompletely developed secondary male sex characteristics, are often tall, have reductions in muscle mass, and produce relatively small amounts of T (The Mayo Clinic, 2016a).

*XYY Males*: Men inheriting an additional Y chromosome have higher than average levels of T and are usually taller than average and are prone to acne. Affected males are typically fertile, and many are unaware that they have a chromosomal abnormality. The frequency of males born with an additional Y chromosome is approximately 1:1,000.",2016-11-15 19:30:30+00:00,da1nuyo,9.0,t1_da120hx,38076.0,Christianity

Nixon described Title X funding as based on the premise that ""no American woman should be denied access to family planning assistance because of her economic condition"".",2016-11-13 18:31:06+00:00,d9yopro,2.0,t1_d9yokt7,172.0,TwoXChromosomes

188,"Gender dysphoria or gender identity disorder (GID) is the formal diagnosis used by psychologists and physicians to describe people who experience significant dysphoria (distress) with the sex and gender they were assigned at birth. Evidence suggests that people who identify with a gender different from the one they were assigned at birth may do so not just due to psychological or behavioral causes, but also biological ones related to their genetics, the makeup of their brains, or prenatal exposure to hormones.

The DSM-IV-TR diagnostic component of distress is not inherent in the cross-gender identity; rather, it is related to social rejection and discrimination suffered by the individual. Psychology professor Darryl Hill insists that gender dysphoria is not a mental disorder, but rather that the diagnostic criteria reflect psychological distress in children that occurs when parents and others have trouble relating to their child's gender variance. Transgender people have often been harassed, socially excluded, and subjected to discrimination, abuse and violence, including murder.

We show some basis in fact for our identification, unlike true delusional or somatoform disorders (which seem the most obvious comparison), the study yo referenced notwithstand, psychiatric medication does not affect our feelings; and unlike true delusional/somatoform disorders, allowing us to pursue our feelings is far from destructive and in fact has exceptionally well-demonstrated positive results. 

As best we can tell, gender identity is at least partially determined by brain structure formed very early in fetal development. A few studies show patterns typical of our identified gender and not of our birth sex.

Moreover, gender dysphoria correlates strongly with endocrine conditions - if we look at people born with externally female bodies, those with PCOS (which raises testosterone) are much more likely to ultimately identify as men; those with CAIS (which makes their bodies incapable of responding to testosterone) almost never do, to the point that single cases merit publication in their own right. On top of that, digit ratio (a marker of prenatal testosterone exposure) displays markedly low T exposure on average in trans women and high T exposure in trans men.

There's even some experimental evidence that, when cis (=not trans) people are categorized contrary to their birth sex, they experience the same distress that trans people do. Under the assumption that gender is malleable to social expectations, David Reimer was raised as a girl after a botched circumcision. He found himself uncomfortable with the female role, displayed symptoms typical of what would be expected of a trans man (that's FTM, to be clear), and ultimately transitioned to living as a man as soon as he became aware of his status in his early teens. And on the flip side, an author named Norah Vincent spent a year living as a man for the purposes of writing a book. By the end of that time, she was so depressed she checked herself into a mental institution because she was worried she might harm herself.

No professional organization in the world - even those that do classify us as a mental illness - recommends just giving us SSRIs or the like and sending us away. Traditional therapies simply do not work.

Compare this with Body Dysmorphic Disorder, a disorder that could be seen as an analog to trans people. BDD sufferers fixate on a small (e.g., a mole) or nonexistent part of their bodies, which they believe makes them hideous and unlovable. Some seek out treatment to remove the offending part. But BDD, unlike trans people, responds well to both therapy and SSRIs and does not respond to their desired interventions.",2016-11-12 23:40:57+00:00,d9xr6f0,6.0,t1_d9xph6v,2617.0,atheism

Some emails sent to the current departments take the same tone as Trump, with insults galore. So much so that many people are essentially going to leave the keys on the table with a ""good luck"" note to the Trump team. They've got 4100 positions to fill and many of the experienced DC hands, both republican and democrat refuse to work in a Trump administration and many people are currently tending their resignations. This is going to be a spectacular shitshow. 

So since the Titanic is going down anyway, I've decided that I'm going to break into First Class and be the last to go down, and maybe get myself into a lifeboat while i'm at it. I've applied to be part of the Trump administration. They've got no vetting whatsoever, so i'm pretty sure i'll get in. And i'll get a front row seat to the circus.

[Transgender: Evidence on the biological nature of gender identity](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/02/150213112317.htm)

**Genetics**  
The androgen receptor (AR), also known as NR3C4, is activated by the binding of testosterone or dihydrotestosterone, where it plays a critical role in the forming of primary and secondary male sex characteristics. Hare et al. found that male-to-female transsexuals were found to have longer repetitions of the gene, which reduced its effectiveness at binding testosterone.

A variant genotype for a gene called CYP17, which acts on the sex hormones pregnenolone and progesterone, has been found to be linked to female-to-male transsexualism but not MTF transsexualism. Most notably, the FTM subjects not only had the variant genotype more frequently, but had an allele distribution equivalent to male controls, unlike the female controls. The paper concluded that the loss of a female-specific CYP17 T -34C allele distribution pattern is associated with FtM transsexualism.

**Brain structure**  
In a first-of-its-kind study, Zhou et al. (1995) found that in a region of the brain called the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTc), a region known for sex and anxiety responses, MTF transsexuals have a female-normal size while FTM transsexuals have a male-normal size. While the transsexuals studied had taken hormones, this was accounted for by including non-transsexual male and female controls who, for a variety of medical reasons, had experienced hormone reversal. The controls still retained sizes typical for their gender. No relationship to sexual orientation was found.

In a follow-up study, Kruijver et al. (2000) looked at the number of neurons in BSTc instead of volumes. They found the same results as Zhou et al. (1995), but with even more dramatic differences. One MTF subject who had never gone on hormones was also included, and who matched up with the female neuron counts nonetheless.

In 2002, a follow-up study by Chung et al. found that significant sexual dimorphism (variation between sexes) in BSTc did not become established until adulthood. Chung et al. theorized that either changes in fetal hormone levels produce changes in BSTc synaptic density, neuronal activity, or neurochemical content which later lead to size and neuron count changes in BSTc, or that the size of BSTc is affected by the failure to generate a gender identity consistent with one's anatomic sex.

In a review of the evidence in 2006, Gooren confirms the earlier research as supporting the concept that transsexualism is a sexual differentiation disorder of the sex dimorphic brain. Dick Swaab (2004) concurs.

In 2008, a new region with properties similar to that of BSTc in regards to transsexualism was found by Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab: the interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH3), part of the hypothalamic uncinate nucleus. The same method of controlling for hormone usage was used as in Zhou et al. (1995) and Kruijver et al. (2000). The differences were even more pronounced than with BSTc; control males averaged 1.9 times the volume and 2.3 times the neurons as control females, yet once again, regardless of hormone exposure, MTF transsexuals lay within the female range and the FTM transsexual within the male range.

While the resolution of MRI tomographs in general can be fine enough, independent nuclei are not visible due to lack of contrast between different neurological tissue types. Therefore, such images do not show detailed structures such as BSTc and INAH3, and studies on BSTC were done by bisecting brains postmortem.

However, MRI does much more easily allow the study of larger brain structures. In Luders et al. (2009), 24 MTF transsexuals not-yet treated with cross-sex hormones were studied via MRI. While regional gray matter concentrations were more similar to men than women, there was a significantly larger volume of gray matter in the right putamen compared to men. As with many earlier studies, they concluded that transsexualism is associated with a distinct cerebral pattern.

An additional feature was studied in a group of FTM transsexuals who had not yet received cross-sex hormones: fractional anisotropy values for white matter in the medial and posterior parts of the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), the forceps minor, and the corticospinal tract. Rametti et al. (2010) discovered that, ""Compared to control females, FtM showed higher FA values in posterior part of the right SLF, the forceps minor and corticospinal tract. Compared to control males, FtM showed only lower FA values in the corticospinal tract.""

Hulshoff Pol et al. (2006), studied the gross brain volume of subjects undergoing hormone treatment. They discovered that whole brain volume for subjects changes toward the size of the opposite sex during hormone treatment. The conclusion of the study was, ""The findings suggest that, throughout life, gonadal hormones remain essential for maintaining aspects of sex-specific differences in the human brain.""

**Brain plasticity**  
Brain structure differences associated with transsexualism do not exist in isolation. Similar brain structure differences have been noted between gay and heterosexual men, and between lesbian and heterosexual women.

More recent studies have found that circumstance and repeated activities such as meditation modify brain structures in a process called brain plasticity or neuroplasticity. In May 2014, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reported that parenting ""rewires the male brain"" for fathers.

**Brain function**  
Phantom limb syndrome is a common, often painful experience after the loss of an external organ. Ramachandran (2008) found that while nearly two thirds of non-transsexual males who have a penis surgically removed experience the sensation of a phantom penis, only one third of MTF transsexuals do so after sex reassignment surgery. This study, however, overlooks the differences between an amputation, where the nerves connecting the penis and the brain are severed, and male-to-female gender reassignment surgery, where some of the penis and scrotum may be reused to create a vaginal canal, labia and a clitoris. In this case, some of the nerves connecting the new genitalia to the brain remain largely intact. Also, two-thirds of FTM transsexuals reported the sensation of a phantom penis from childhood onwards, complete with phantom erections and other phenomena.

Berglund et al. (2008) tested the response of gynephilic MTF transsexuals to two sex pheromones: the progestin-like 4,16-androstadien-3-one (AND) and the estrogen-like 1,3,5(10),16-tetraen-3-ol (EST). Despite the difference in sexuality, the MTFs' hypothalamic networks activated in response to AND, like the androphilic female control groups. Both groups experienced amygdala activation in response to EST. Male control groups (gynephilic) experienced hypothalamic activation in response to EST. However, the MTF subjects also experienced limited hypothalamic activation to EST as well. The researchers' conclusion was, that in terms of pheromone activation, MTF's occupy an intermediate position with predominantly female features.[17] The MTF transsexual subjects had not undergone any hormonal treatment at the time of the study, according to their own declaration beforehand, and confirmed by repeated tests of hormonal levels.

**Transsexuality among twins**  
In a 2013 study based on previously published research and conducted surveys it was found that in 39 coming from a single fertilized egg, monozygotic twin male pairs, 13 (33%) identified both of themselves as transsexual. This was found in 8 of 25 (22.5%) female pairs. Alternatively only 1 out of 38 (2.6%) coming from different fertilized eggs, dizygotic male and female pairs identified themselves as transsexual. The significant percentage of transsexual identification in both of the identical twins, and the virtual absence of this correspondence in dizygotic twins raised in the same family at the same time, supports the argument that one's transsexual identity is significantly influenced by genetics.

**Prenatal androgen exposure**  
Prenatal androgen exposure, the lack thereof, or poor sensitivity to prenatal androgens are commonly cited mechanisms to explain the above discoveries. Schneider, Pickel, and Stalla (2006) found a correlation between digit ratio (a generally accepted marker for prenatal androgen exposure) and male to female transsexualism. MTF transsexuals were found to have a higher digit ratio than control males, but one that was comparable to control females.",2016-11-06 05:30:38+00:00,d9nukom,13.0,t1_d9nt0y9,3184.0,news

I didnt realize that articles posted in peer reviewed journals constituted ""opinionated commentary."" Did you want to get into the details of the studies? Or fixate on sample size? You dont think I've had this argument before with people like you? You dont think I've argued this a million times over and I havent done the research?  Here, have some science, maybe that'll shut you up. 

[Transgender: Evidence on the biological nature of gender identity](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/02/150213112317.htm)

**Genetics**  
The androgen receptor (AR), also known as NR3C4, is activated by the binding of testosterone or dihydrotestosterone, where it plays a critical role in the forming of primary and secondary male sex characteristics. Hare et al. found that male-to-female transsexuals were found to have longer repetitions of the gene, which reduced its effectiveness at binding testosterone.

A variant genotype for a gene called CYP17, which acts on the sex hormones pregnenolone and progesterone, has been found to be linked to female-to-male transsexualism but not MTF transsexualism. Most notably, the FTM subjects not only had the variant genotype more frequently, but had an allele distribution equivalent to male controls, unlike the female controls. The paper concluded that the loss of a female-specific CYP17 T -34C allele distribution pattern is associated with FtM transsexualism.

**Brain structure**  
In a first-of-its-kind study, Zhou et al. (1995) found that in a region of the brain called the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTc), a region known for sex and anxiety responses, MTF transsexuals have a female-normal size while FTM transsexuals have a male-normal size. While the transsexuals studied had taken hormones, this was accounted for by including non-transsexual male and female controls who, for a variety of medical reasons, had experienced hormone reversal. The controls still retained sizes typical for their gender. No relationship to sexual orientation was found.

In a follow-up study, Kruijver et al. (2000) looked at the number of neurons in BSTc instead of volumes. They found the same results as Zhou et al. (1995), but with even more dramatic differences. One MTF subject who had never gone on hormones was also included, and who matched up with the female neuron counts nonetheless.

In 2002, a follow-up study by Chung et al. found that significant sexual dimorphism (variation between sexes) in BSTc did not become established until adulthood. Chung et al. theorized that either changes in fetal hormone levels produce changes in BSTc synaptic density, neuronal activity, or neurochemical content which later lead to size and neuron count changes in BSTc, or that the size of BSTc is affected by the failure to generate a gender identity consistent with one's anatomic sex.

In a review of the evidence in 2006, Gooren confirms the earlier research as supporting the concept that transsexualism is a sexual differentiation disorder of the sex dimorphic brain. Dick Swaab (2004) concurs.

In 2008, a new region with properties similar to that of BSTc in regards to transsexualism was found by Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab: the interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH3), part of the hypothalamic uncinate nucleus. The same method of controlling for hormone usage was used as in Zhou et al. (1995) and Kruijver et al. (2000). The differences were even more pronounced than with BSTc; control males averaged 1.9 times the volume and 2.3 times the neurons as control females, yet once again, regardless of hormone exposure, MTF transsexuals lay within the female range and the FTM transsexual within the male range.

While the resolution of MRI tomographs in general can be fine enough, independent nuclei are not visible due to lack of contrast between different neurological tissue types. Therefore, such images do not show detailed structures such as BSTc and INAH3, and studies on BSTC were done by bisecting brains postmortem.

However, MRI does much more easily allow the study of larger brain structures. In Luders et al. (2009), 24 MTF transsexuals not-yet treated with cross-sex hormones were studied via MRI. While regional gray matter concentrations were more similar to men than women, there was a significantly larger volume of gray matter in the right putamen compared to men. As with many earlier studies, they concluded that transsexualism is associated with a distinct cerebral pattern.

An additional feature was studied in a group of FTM transsexuals who had not yet received cross-sex hormones: fractional anisotropy values for white matter in the medial and posterior parts of the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), the forceps minor, and the corticospinal tract. Rametti et al. (2010) discovered that, ""Compared to control females, FtM showed higher FA values in posterior part of the right SLF, the forceps minor and corticospinal tract. Compared to control males, FtM showed only lower FA values in the corticospinal tract.""

Hulshoff Pol et al. (2006), studied the gross brain volume of subjects undergoing hormone treatment. They discovered that whole brain volume for subjects changes toward the size of the opposite sex during hormone treatment. The conclusion of the study was, ""The findings suggest that, throughout life, gonadal hormones remain essential for maintaining aspects of sex-specific differences in the human brain.""

**Brain plasticity**  
Brain structure differences associated with transsexualism do not exist in isolation. Similar brain structure differences have been noted between gay and heterosexual men, and between lesbian and heterosexual women.

More recent studies have found that circumstance and repeated activities such as meditation modify brain structures in a process called brain plasticity or neuroplasticity. In May 2014, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reported that parenting ""rewires the male brain"" for fathers.

**Brain function**  
Phantom limb syndrome is a common, often painful experience after the loss of an external organ. Ramachandran (2008) found that while nearly two thirds of non-transsexual males who have a penis surgically removed experience the sensation of a phantom penis, only one third of MTF transsexuals do so after sex reassignment surgery. This study, however, overlooks the differences between an amputation, where the nerves connecting the penis and the brain are severed, and male-to-female gender reassignment surgery, where some of the penis and scrotum may be reused to create a vaginal canal, labia and a clitoris. In this case, some of the nerves connecting the new genitalia to the brain remain largely intact. Also, two-thirds of FTM transsexuals reported the sensation of a phantom penis from childhood onwards, complete with phantom erections and other phenomena.

Berglund et al. (2008) tested the response of gynephilic MTF transsexuals to two sex pheromones: the progestin-like 4,16-androstadien-3-one (AND) and the estrogen-like 1,3,5(10),16-tetraen-3-ol (EST). Despite the difference in sexuality, the MTFs' hypothalamic networks activated in response to AND, like the androphilic female control groups. Both groups experienced amygdala activation in response to EST. Male control groups (gynephilic) experienced hypothalamic activation in response to EST. However, the MTF subjects also experienced limited hypothalamic activation to EST as well. The researchers' conclusion was, that in terms of pheromone activation, MTF's occupy an intermediate position with predominantly female features.[17] The MTF transsexual subjects had not undergone any hormonal treatment at the time of the study, according to their own declaration beforehand, and confirmed by repeated tests of hormonal levels.

371,"Do you even science? Biology doesn’t work that way. Biological phenomena don’t necessarily fit into human-ordained binary categories. So while humans insist that you’re either male or female – that you have either XY or XX sex chromosomes – biology begs to differ.

Divergence from the normal number of X and Y chromosomes, called sex chromosome aneuploidy (SCA), accounts for approximately half of all chromosomal anomalies in humans, with a total frequency of 1:400 (Passarge, 1995). Aneuploidy occurs in at least 5% of all pregnancies, which is a relatively high frequency, and is the most commonly recognized chromosome abnormality in humans (Hassold and Hunt, 2001). Below are some examples:

*Turner Syndrome*: This disorder, also referred to as monosomy X (45X), occurs only in girls and women when the X chromosome is totally or partially missing. Although 45X is a frequent chromosomal anomaly, Turner syndrome is rare, with a live-birth frequency of 1:3,000 (Hook and Warburton, 1983). Affected individuals experience abnormal growth patterns, heart defects, and certain learning disabilities; they are short in stature; generally lack prominent female secondary sexual characteristics; and are sterile—features that in some individuals lead to social adjustment problems (The Mayo Clinic, 2016c).

*XXX Females*: Women with three X chromosomes (47XXX), referred to as Triple X syndrome, or trisomy X, experience normal development of sexual traits and are fertile. Affected individuals are usually taller than average and have slender builds and no severe phenotype, but may have a slight learning disorder (The Mayo Clinic, 2016b, U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2016). The frequency of women obtaining an extra X chromosome is approximately 1:1,000.

*Klinefelter Syndrome*: Klinefelter syndrome (47XXY or XY/XXY mosaic) is the most pervasive sex chromosomal anomaly (Klinefelter et al., 1942), affecting approximately 1 in 600 males (Nielsen and Wohlert, 1990). Males with Klinefelter syndrome carry two or more X chromosomes resulting in abnormal development of the testis, leading to hypogonadism and infertility (Bojesen et al., 2004). Affected males have incompletely developed secondary male sex characteristics, are often tall, have reductions in muscle mass, and produce relatively small amounts of T (The Mayo Clinic, 2016a).

*XYY Males*: Men inheriting an additional Y chromosome have higher than average levels of T and are usually taller than average and are prone to acne. Affected males are typically fertile, and many are unaware that they have a chromosomal abnormality. The frequency of males born with an additional Y chromosome is approximately 1:1,000.",2016-11-06 05:22:33+00:00,d9nucmu,11.0,t1_d9ntcfl,2081.0,asktransgender

[Transgender: Evidence on the biological nature of gender identity](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/02/150213112317.htm)

**Genetics**  
The androgen receptor (AR), also known as NR3C4, is activated by the binding of testosterone or dihydrotestosterone, where it plays a critical role in the forming of primary and secondary male sex characteristics. Hare et al. found that male-to-female transsexuals were found to have longer repetitions of the gene, which reduced its effectiveness at binding testosterone.

A variant genotype for a gene called CYP17, which acts on the sex hormones pregnenolone and progesterone, has been found to be linked to female-to-male transsexualism but not MTF transsexualism. Most notably, the FTM subjects not only had the variant genotype more frequently, but had an allele distribution equivalent to male controls, unlike the female controls. The paper concluded that the loss of a female-specific CYP17 T -34C allele distribution pattern is associated with FtM transsexualism.

**Brain structure**  
In a first-of-its-kind study, Zhou et al. (1995) found that in a region of the brain called the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTc), a region known for sex and anxiety responses, MTF transsexuals have a female-normal size while FTM transsexuals have a male-normal size. While the transsexuals studied had taken hormones, this was accounted for by including non-transsexual male and female controls who, for a variety of medical reasons, had experienced hormone reversal. The controls still retained sizes typical for their gender. No relationship to sexual orientation was found.

In a follow-up study, Kruijver et al. (2000) looked at the number of neurons in BSTc instead of volumes. They found the same results as Zhou et al. (1995), but with even more dramatic differences. One MTF subject who had never gone on hormones was also included, and who matched up with the female neuron counts nonetheless.

In 2002, a follow-up study by Chung et al. found that significant sexual dimorphism (variation between sexes) in BSTc did not become established until adulthood. Chung et al. theorized that either changes in fetal hormone levels produce changes in BSTc synaptic density, neuronal activity, or neurochemical content which later lead to size and neuron count changes in BSTc, or that the size of BSTc is affected by the failure to generate a gender identity consistent with one's anatomic sex.

In a review of the evidence in 2006, Gooren confirms the earlier research as supporting the concept that transsexualism is a sexual differentiation disorder of the sex dimorphic brain. Dick Swaab (2004) concurs.

In 2008, a new region with properties similar to that of BSTc in regards to transsexualism was found by Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab: the interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH3), part of the hypothalamic uncinate nucleus. The same method of controlling for hormone usage was used as in Zhou et al. (1995) and Kruijver et al. (2000). The differences were even more pronounced than with BSTc; control males averaged 1.9 times the volume and 2.3 times the neurons as control females, yet once again, regardless of hormone exposure, MTF transsexuals lay within the female range and the FTM transsexual within the male range.

While the resolution of MRI tomographs in general can be fine enough, independent nuclei are not visible due to lack of contrast between different neurological tissue types. Therefore, such images do not show detailed structures such as BSTc and INAH3, and studies on BSTC were done by bisecting brains postmortem.

However, MRI does much more easily allow the study of larger brain structures. In Luders et al. (2009), 24 MTF transsexuals not-yet treated with cross-sex hormones were studied via MRI. While regional gray matter concentrations were more similar to men than women, there was a significantly larger volume of gray matter in the right putamen compared to men. As with many earlier studies, they concluded that transsexualism is associated with a distinct cerebral pattern.

An additional feature was studied in a group of FTM transsexuals who had not yet received cross-sex hormones: fractional anisotropy values for white matter in the medial and posterior parts of the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), the forceps minor, and the corticospinal tract. Rametti et al. (2010) discovered that, ""Compared to control females, FtM showed higher FA values in posterior part of the right SLF, the forceps minor and corticospinal tract. Compared to control males, FtM showed only lower FA values in the corticospinal tract.""

Hulshoff Pol et al. (2006), studied the gross brain volume of subjects undergoing hormone treatment. They discovered that whole brain volume for subjects changes toward the size of the opposite sex during hormone treatment. The conclusion of the study was, ""The findings suggest that, throughout life, gonadal hormones remain essential for maintaining aspects of sex-specific differences in the human brain.""

**Brain plasticity**  
Brain structure differences associated with transsexualism do not exist in isolation. Similar brain structure differences have been noted between gay and heterosexual men, and between lesbian and heterosexual women.

More recent studies have found that circumstance and repeated activities such as meditation modify brain structures in a process called brain plasticity or neuroplasticity. In May 2014, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reported that parenting ""rewires the male brain"" for fathers.

**Brain function**  
Phantom limb syndrome is a common, often painful experience after the loss of an external organ. Ramachandran (2008) found that while nearly two thirds of non-transsexual males who have a penis surgically removed experience the sensation of a phantom penis, only one third of MTF transsexuals do so after sex reassignment surgery. This study, however, overlooks the differences between an amputation, where the nerves connecting the penis and the brain are severed, and male-to-female gender reassignment surgery, where some of the penis and scrotum may be reused to create a vaginal canal, labia and a clitoris. In this case, some of the nerves connecting the new genitalia to the brain remain largely intact. Also, two-thirds of FTM transsexuals reported the sensation of a phantom penis from childhood onwards, complete with phantom erections and other phenomena.

Berglund et al. (2008) tested the response of gynephilic MTF transsexuals to two sex pheromones: the progestin-like 4,16-androstadien-3-one (AND) and the estrogen-like 1,3,5(10),16-tetraen-3-ol (EST). Despite the difference in sexuality, the MTFs' hypothalamic networks activated in response to AND, like the androphilic female control groups. Both groups experienced amygdala activation in response to EST. Male control groups (gynephilic) experienced hypothalamic activation in response to EST. However, the MTF subjects also experienced limited hypothalamic activation to EST as well. The researchers' conclusion was, that in terms of pheromone activation, MTF's occupy an intermediate position with predominantly female features.[17] The MTF transsexual subjects had not undergone any hormonal treatment at the time of the study, according to their own declaration beforehand, and confirmed by repeated tests of hormonal levels.

**Transsexuality among twins**  
In a 2013 study based on previously published research and conducted surveys it was found that in 39 coming from a single fertilized egg, monozygotic twin male pairs, 13 (33%) identified both of themselves as transsexual. This was found in 8 of 25 (22.5%) female pairs. Alternatively only 1 out of 38 (2.6%) coming from different fertilized eggs, dizygotic male and female pairs identified themselves as transsexual. The significant percentage of transsexual identification in both of the identical twins, and the virtual absence of this correspondence in dizygotic twins raised in the same family at the same time, supports the argument that one's transsexual identity is significantly influenced by genetics.

**Prenatal androgen exposure**  
Prenatal androgen exposure, the lack thereof, or poor sensitivity to prenatal androgens are commonly cited mechanisms to explain the above discoveries. Schneider, Pickel, and Stalla (2006) found a correlation between digit ratio (a generally accepted marker for prenatal androgen exposure) and male to female transsexualism. MTF transsexuals were found to have a higher digit ratio than control males, but one that was comparable to control females.",2016-11-06 04:57:38+00:00,d9ntn4i,,t1_d9nt4kz,1016.0,genderqueer

380,"LMAO, how many times do you want to be wrong today? Do you even science? Biology doesn’t work that way. Biological phenomena don’t necessarily fit into human-ordained binary categories. So while humans insist that you’re either male or female – that you have either XY or XX sex chromosomes – biology begs to differ.

Divergence from the normal number of X and Y chromosomes, called sex chromosome aneuploidy (SCA), accounts for approximately half of all chromosomal anomalies in humans, with a total frequency of 1:400 (Passarge, 1995). Aneuploidy occurs in at least 5% of all pregnancies, which is a relatively high frequency, and is the most commonly recognized chromosome abnormality in humans (Hassold and Hunt, 2001). Below are some examples:

*Turner Syndrome*: This disorder, also referred to as monosomy X (45X), occurs only in girls and women when the X chromosome is totally or partially missing. Although 45X is a frequent chromosomal anomaly, Turner syndrome is rare, with a live-birth frequency of 1:3,000 (Hook and Warburton, 1983). Affected individuals experience abnormal growth patterns, heart defects, and certain learning disabilities; they are short in stature; generally lack prominent female secondary sexual characteristics; and are sterile—features that in some individuals lead to social adjustment problems (The Mayo Clinic, 2016c).

*XXX Females*: Women with three X chromosomes (47XXX), referred to as Triple X syndrome, or trisomy X, experience normal development of sexual traits and are fertile. Affected individuals are usually taller than average and have slender builds and no severe phenotype, but may have a slight learning disorder (The Mayo Clinic, 2016b, U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2016). The frequency of women obtaining an extra X chromosome is approximately 1:1,000.

*Klinefelter Syndrome*: Klinefelter syndrome (47XXY or XY/XXY mosaic) is the most pervasive sex chromosomal anomaly (Klinefelter et al., 1942), affecting approximately 1 in 600 males (Nielsen and Wohlert, 1990). Males with Klinefelter syndrome carry two or more X chromosomes resulting in abnormal development of the testis, leading to hypogonadism and infertility (Bojesen et al., 2004). Affected males have incompletely developed secondary male sex characteristics, are often tall, have reductions in muscle mass, and produce relatively small amounts of T (The Mayo Clinic, 2016a).

*XYY Males*: Men inheriting an additional Y chromosome have higher than average levels of T and are usually taller than average and are prone to acne. Affected males are typically fertile, and many are unaware that they have a chromosomal abnormality. The frequency of males born with an additional Y chromosome is approximately 1:1,000.",2016-11-06 02:12:23+00:00,d9nnoju,15.0,t1_d9nlnsb,2807.0,news

Again, simply not true, every effort is built upon those that came before. Allow me to take a very brief run though lgbt history. Jeremy Bentham is one of the first people to argue for the decriminalization of sodomy in England.... in 1785. Brazil decriminalized homosexual acts in 1830, Portugal in 1852. Magnus Hirschfeld founded the Scientific Humanitarian Committee in 1897 as the first ever official organization for homosexual rights. The Center for Culture and Recreation is founded in the Netherlands in 1946 and it is the oldest surviving LGBT organization in the world. 

In 1959, ITV, at the time the UK's only national commercial broadcaster, broadcasts the first gay drama. That same year the first homosexual uprising in the USA occurs at Cooper’s Doughnuts in Los Angeles. 

The Compton's Cafeteria Riot occurred in August 1966 in the Tenderloin district of San Francisco. This incident was one of the first recorded transgender riots in United States history. 

The most famous and well known of all the LGBT riots occurred at the Stonewall Inn, N.Y. in 1969. That led to the first Pride parade, and that's the one we celebrate today. 

In 1973 the Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatry Federal Council declares homosexuality not an illness – the first such body in the world to do so. It was followed by the American Psychiatric Association in 1974. The first marriage certificate issued to a gay couple happened in Boulder, Colorado in 1975. In 1977, Harvey Milk is elected city-county supervisor in San Francisco, becoming the fifth out American elected to public office. 

The lesbian and gay association ""Ten Percent Club"" is formed in Hong Kong in 1984

Ellen came out in 1997, before Will and Grace that debuted in 1998.

British Columbia legalizes marriage of same sex couples in 2003, followed by  Massachusetts in 2004, Spain in 2005, all of Canada in 2005, South Africa in 2006, Connecticut in 2008, finally ending in 2015 when the Supreme Court ruled that marriage must be afforded to ALL same sex couples.

And the fight goes on today for protections in employment and housing, and marriage equality in Australia and South East  Asia.

413,"Do you even science? Biology doesn’t work that way. Biological phenomena don’t necessarily fit into human-ordained binary categories. So while humans insist that you’re either male or female – that you have either XY or XX sex chromosomes – biology begs to differ.

Divergence from the normal number of X and Y chromosomes, called sex chromosome aneuploidy (SCA), accounts for approximately half of all chromosomal anomalies in humans, with a total frequency of 1:400 (Passarge, 1995). Aneuploidy occurs in at least 5% of all pregnancies, which is a relatively high frequency, and is the most commonly recognized chromosome abnormality in humans (Hassold and Hunt, 2001). Below are some examples:

*Turner Syndrome*: This disorder, also referred to as monosomy X (45X), occurs only in girls and women when the X chromosome is totally or partially missing. Although 45X is a frequent chromosomal anomaly, Turner syndrome is rare, with a live-birth frequency of 1:3,000 (Hook and Warburton, 1983). Affected individuals experience abnormal growth patterns, heart defects, and certain learning disabilities; they are short in stature; generally lack prominent female secondary sexual characteristics; and are sterile—features that in some individuals lead to social adjustment problems (The Mayo Clinic, 2016c).

*XXX Females*: Women with three X chromosomes (47XXX), referred to as Triple X syndrome, or trisomy X, experience normal development of sexual traits and are fertile. Affected individuals are usually taller than average and have slender builds and no severe phenotype, but may have a slight learning disorder (The Mayo Clinic, 2016b, U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2016). The frequency of women obtaining an extra X chromosome is approximately 1:1,000.

*Klinefelter Syndrome*: Klinefelter syndrome (47XXY or XY/XXY mosaic) is the most pervasive sex chromosomal anomaly (Klinefelter et al., 1942), affecting approximately 1 in 600 males (Nielsen and Wohlert, 1990). Males with Klinefelter syndrome carry two or more X chromosomes resulting in abnormal development of the testis, leading to hypogonadism and infertility (Bojesen et al., 2004). Affected males have incompletely developed secondary male sex characteristics, are often tall, have reductions in muscle mass, and produce relatively small amounts of T (The Mayo Clinic, 2016a).

*XYY Males*: Men inheriting an additional Y chromosome have higher than average levels of T and are usually taller than average and are prone to acne. Affected males are typically fertile, and many are unaware that they have a chromosomal abnormality. The frequency of males born with an additional Y chromosome is approximately 1:1,000.",2016-11-04 16:34:02+00:00,d9lo7zv,4.0,t1_d9lmtyn,1620.0,politics

A survey of scientists who are members of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press in May and June 2009, finds that members of this group are, on the whole, much less religious than the general public. Indeed, the survey shows that scientists are roughly half as likely as the general public to believe in God or a higher power. According to the poll, just over half of scientists (51%) believe in some form of deity or higher power; specifically, 33% of scientists say they believe in God, while 18% believe in a universal spirit or higher power. So basically the exact opposite of what you claim.

442,"&gt; Again there is no proof that proves God does not exist.

Again, you are the one positing the existence of such a deity, ergo, it is incumbent upon you to provide the testable set of criteria in order to prove that he does in fact exist so people might replicate an experiment to confirm your hypothesis.

444,"&gt; There will never be sufficient proof until God comes back

So no proof, gotcha, didnt think so.

&gt;Albert Einstein used logical to state God's existence, not proof.

Einstein expressed his skepticism regarding an anthropomorphic deity, often describing it as ""naïve"" and ""childlike"". He stated, ""It seems to me that the idea of a personal God is an anthropological concept which I cannot take seriously. I feel also not able to imagine some will or goal outside the human sphere. My views are near those of Spinoza: admiration for the beauty of and belief in the logical simplicity of the order which we can grasp humbly and only imperfectly. I believe that we have to content ourselves with our imperfect knowledge and understanding and **treat values and moral obligations as a purely human problem**—the most important of all human problems.""",2016-11-02 23:24:58+00:00,d9j4cvx,8.0,t1_d9j3xnu,566.0,atheism

Yeah, about that

http://infidels.org/library/modern/donald_morgan/contradictions.html

&gt; Tells us how the the universe was made. 

The ancient Hebrews imagined the world as flat and round [disk], covered by the great solid dome of the firmament which was held up by mountain pillars, (Job 26:11; 37:18). The blue color of the sky was attributed to the chaotic waters that the firmament separated from the earth (Gen. 1:7). The earth was thus surrounded by waters above and below (Gen. 1:6,7; cf. Psalms 24:2; 148:4, Deut. 5:8). The firmament was thought to be substantial; it had pillars (Job 26:11) and foundations (2 Sam. 22:8). When the windows of it were opened, rain fell (Gen. 7:11-12; 8:2). The sun, moon, and stars moved across or were fixed in the firmament (Gen. 1:14-19; Ps. 19:4,6). It was also the abode of the birds (Gen. 1:20; Deut. 4:17). Within the earth lay Sheol, the realm of the dead (Num. 16:30-33; Isa. 14:9,15).""

Yes, those Bronze Age science wizards whose creation folktales were collected in the Old Testament really did believe that the earth was covered by a solid dome.  The Hebrew word translated as firmament in Genesis is ""raqiya.""  Strong's Lexicon (searchable at the Blue Letter Bible website) translates the word as ""extended surface (solid), expanse, firmament.""  In keeping with the notion of solidity, the dome was thought to be impervious to water, i.e., it separated the waters above it from the waters below, to contain windows that regulated precipitation, to serve as a surface across which the sun, moon, and stars traveled, and to serve as a sub-floor for the mythical reservoirs of snow and hail (Job 38:22).

&gt;  historians use it often. 

Errr, no, they dont

The Gospels are absolutely replete with historical errors and with contradictions. The gospel of Matthew says that Jesus was born in 4 B.C. The gospel of Luke says Jesus was born in 6 A.D. That’s 10 years difference, which one was right?

The darkness at the crucifixion, the rising saints of Matthew, the earthquake, resurrection, and the “crucifixion” itself are mythological events, they were NOT recorded by historians who lived during that period of time. Philo Judaes lived around 50 CE and never mentions the Gospel events; the Roman records of Pilate DO NOT mention Jesus. Thousands of criminals were crucified by the Romans, but no record exists of Jesus, simply because the Pilate did not crucify him. He was saved by God according to Psalms 20:6, Hebrews 5:7, and Al-Quran 4:157. Regarding the alleged “darkness and earthquake in Matthew”, there is not a shred of evidence to support the Gospel story.
 
Matthew is the only Gospel in the New Testament that records “Herod’s slaughter of the innocents”. We have explicit quotations from scholars to substantiate that “Herod’s slaughter of the innocents” is just another recapture of pagan mythology. The sun-gods of ancient Greece, Rome, and Egypt were threatened at birth, and the order was made to kill all the “new-born infants”.

The darkness at the crucifixion, the rising saints of Matthew, the earthquake, resurrection, and the “crucifixion” itself are mythological events, they were NOT recorded by historians who lived during that period of time. Philo Judaes lived around 50 CE and never mentions the Gospel events; the Roman records of Pilate DO NOT mention Jesus. Thousands of criminals were crucified by the Romans, but no record exists of Jesus, simply because the Pilate did not crucify him. He was saved by God according to Psalms 20:6, Hebrews 5:7, and Al-Quran 4:157. Regarding the alleged “darkness and earthquake in Matthew”, there is not a shred of evidence to support the Gospel story.

&gt;Atheists debate with Christians more often than other religions 

Atheists do not believe in any god, because you cannot prove that a god exists.

&gt;People just hate Christianity because it contradicts what they want; to live in their sin.

515,"Robert S. Beil, M.D., of Montefiore Medical Group says, ""Losing testosterone means losing strength and having less athletic agility,"" he explains. ""We don't know if testosterone has a direct effect on muscle strength, but without the testosterone, they are maintained at a lower pace."" This means that women typically need to work harder for longer to maintain muscle mass, whereas men see results more quickly.

Beil adds that men have a higher average blood count rate, and transitioning can ""cause the red blood cell counts to go down, because the amount of red blood cells and red blood cell production is influenced by testosterone."" Your red blood cells are integral in carrying oxygen from the lungs to your tissues; people who get blood transfusions often feel a surge of strength and vitality, whereas people with anemia feel weak. This could explain why trans women atheletes report a decrease in stamina and endurance.

Fat redistributes as well, giving trans women breasts and a slightly fleshier, curvier shape. 

The reverse transition of female to male (FTM) receives less of the athletic focus, but it's worth noting that, yes, trans men do typically feel the opposite effects, though a bit sooner because testosterone is so potent. ""It can take years to develop the body you want under normal circumstances, but testosterone makes it happen very quickly,"" Beil explains. ""It changes your strength and speed and ability to respond to exercise."" ",2016-11-01 18:10:19+00:00,d9h4zqp,,t1_d9h1iwr,3985.0,transgender

574,"Research proving that there is biological evidence for sexual orientation has been available since the 1980s. The links have been emphasized by new scientific research.

In 2014, researchers confirmed the association between same-sex orientation in men and a [specific chromosomal region](http://news.sciencemag.org/biology/2014/11/study-gay-brothers-may-confirm-x-chromosome-link-homosexuality). This is similar to findings originally published in the 1990s, which, at that time, gave rise to the idea that a “gay gene” must exist. But this argument has never been substantiated, despite the fact that studies have shown that homosexuality is a heritable trait.
Evidence points toward the existence of a complex interaction between genes and environment, which are responsible for the heritable nature of sexual orientation.

Although research has not yet found what the precise mechanisms are that determine sexual orientation—which may be heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual or asexual—the answers are likely to come to the fore through continued research. These findings will be important for the field of genetics and, more importantly, for those attracted to others of the same sex and society as a whole.

600,"People tend to define sex in a binary way — either wholly male or wholly female — based on physical appearance or by which sex chromosomes an individual carries. But while sex and gender may seem dichotomous, there are in reality many intermediates.

 Understanding this complexity is critical; misperceptions can affect the health and civil liberties of those who fall outside perceived societal norms. Society has categorical views on what should define sex and gender, but the biological reality is just not there to support that.

 

 

Even at the most basic physical level, there is a spectrum between male and female that often goes unrecognized and risks being obscured by stigma. 

A growing body of research is showing how biology influences gender expression, sexual orientation and gender identity — characteristics that can also fall outside of strict, socially defined categories. Toy-preference tests, a popular gauge of gender expression, have long shown that boys and girls will typically gravitate to toys that are stereotypically associated with their gender (cars and guns for boys, for instance, or plush toys for girls). While one might argue that this could be the by-product of a child’s environment — parental influence at play or an internalization of societal norms — Melissa Hines, a former UCLA researcher and current professor of psychology at the University of Cambridge, in England, has shown otherwise. In 2008, she demonstrated that monkeys showed the same sex-based toy preferences as humans — absent societal influence.

Sexual orientation (whether one tends to be attracted to men or women) has also been shown to have biological roots. Twin studies and genetic linkage studies have shown both hereditary patterns in homosexuality (attraction to one’s own sex), as well as genetic associations with specific parts of the genome. And while gender identity — the sense one has of oneself as being either male or female — has been harder to pinpoint from a biological standpoint, efforts to understand what role biology may play are ongoing.",2016-10-29 00:58:35+00:00,d9c81nf,8.0,t1_d9c7i0h,920.0,politics

616,"I mean, you're entitled to your opinion, wrong though it is. But science is fact based, and to deny it just speaks to your unwillingess to change your way of thinking. Biological phenomena don’t necessarily fit into human-ordained binary categories. So while humans insist that you’re either male or female – that you have either XY or XX sex chromosomes – biology begs to differ.

Divergence from the normal number of X and Y chromosomes, called sex chromosome aneuploidy (SCA), accounts for approximately half of all chromosomal anomalies in humans, with a total frequency of 1:400 (Passarge, 1995). Aneuploidy occurs in at least 5% of all pregnancies, which is a relatively high frequency, and is the most commonly recognized chromosome abnormality in humans (Hassold and Hunt, 2001). Below are some examples:

*Turner Syndrome*: This disorder, also referred to as monosomy X (45X), occurs only in girls and women when the X chromosome is totally or partially missing. Although 45X is a frequent chromosomal anomaly, Turner syndrome is rare, with a live-birth frequency of 1:3,000 (Hook and Warburton, 1983). Affected individuals experience abnormal growth patterns, heart defects, and certain learning disabilities; they are short in stature; generally lack prominent female secondary sexual characteristics; and are sterile—features that in some individuals lead to social adjustment problems (The Mayo Clinic, 2016c).

*XXX Females*: Women with three X chromosomes (47XXX), referred to as Triple X syndrome, or trisomy X, experience normal development of sexual traits and are fertile. Affected individuals are usually taller than average and have slender builds and no severe phenotype, but may have a slight learning disorder (The Mayo Clinic, 2016b, U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2016). The frequency of women obtaining an extra X chromosome is approximately 1:1,000.

*Klinefelter Syndrome*: Klinefelter syndrome (47XXY or XY/XXY mosaic) is the most pervasive sex chromosomal anomaly (Klinefelter et al., 1942), affecting approximately 1 in 600 males (Nielsen and Wohlert, 1990). Males with Klinefelter syndrome carry two or more X chromosomes resulting in abnormal development of the testis, leading to hypogonadism and infertility (Bojesen et al., 2004). Affected males have incompletely developed secondary male sex characteristics, are often tall, have reductions in muscle mass, and produce relatively small amounts of T (The Mayo Clinic, 2016a).

*XYY Males*: Men inheriting an additional Y chromosome have higher than average levels of T and are usually taller than average and are prone to acne. Affected males are typically fertile, and many are unaware that they have a chromosomal abnormality. The frequency of males born with an additional Y chromosome is approximately 1:1,000.",2016-10-28 22:17:50+00:00,d9c265c,4.0,t1_d9c1avx,1324.0,politics

Just because it's a marker, doesnt mean it will manifest as full blown gender dysphoria.

656,"Because ""partial-birth abortion"" is a political term that has no basis in medicine. In fact, the phrase was made up by the National Right to Life Committee in 1995, according to NPR. The NRLC is, of course, an anti-abortion group, and not a medical authority. The proper name for the procedure is ""late term abortion."" 

When a woman has an abortion after 20 weeks, it's because there's something gravely wrong with the pregnancy. These are often very much wanted pregnancies where it's been determined at the 20 week ultrasound that the fetus will not survive, or that the mother's life is at risk.

714,"Sure i can, the Kansas economy is a laughing stock. Here are some facts again.

Since it took effect in January 2013, total employment in Kansas has risen only 2.6 percent, compared to 6.5 percent nationally.  Private sector employment in Kansas has risen 3.5 percent, compared to 7.6 percent nationally.

The state’s economy has grown less than half as fast as the national economy; Kansas’ gross domestic product (GDP) grew 4.8 percent from the end of 2012 through the first quarter of 2016, while national GDP rose 11.9 percent.

Kansas’ share of newly opened business establishments in the United States has actually declined slightly rather than increased.
Moreover, the Kansas tax cut package has had a deleterious impact on the state’s financial stability and the provision of critical services.  For example:

Personal income tax revenues in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2016 (fiscal year 2016) were almost $700 million lower than those received in fiscal year 2013, when the tax cut first took effect, even though the economy nationally is stronger in 2016 than it was in 2013.  Receipts dropped immediately by slightly more than $700 million (24 percent), and the meager economic growth that occurred in Kansas from 2014 to 2016 boosted collections by only $30 million, or less than 2 percent.

Total General Fund revenues in 2016 were $570 million below 2013 levels, despite significant sales and cigarette tax increases enacted to partially offset the income tax losses.  The General Fund’s ending balance fell from $709 million in 2013 to $40 million in 2016 (just 0.7 percent of General Fund spending). That’s important because Kansas’ General Fund balance is its “rainy day fund.”  Should a recession hit and tax revenues shrink as household incomes and retail sales fall, the state will need to cut programs or enact tax increases almost immediately because it will have very little savings to tap. 

The General Fund’s depletion occurred even though the state transferred to the Fund substantial tax revenues that were collected to finance road maintenance and construction. The resulting reduction in infrastructure funding has forced the state to postpone numerous highway projects indefinitely.

Because the tax cuts leave less state revenue with which to repay people who lend the state money by buying its bonds, Kansas’ bond rating has been downgraded twice — in 2014, and most recently on July 26, 2016. Lower bond ratings mean that the state will likely have to pay a higher interest rate on future borrowings, raising the cost of infrastructure projects such as school construction and road building.

Nationally, total nonfarm employment since January 2013 has grown by 5.9 percent – far outpacing Kansas’ 3.3 percent growth rate. 

Looking at just private-sector jobs, the U.S. growth rate has been 6.9 percent – way above the 4.3 percent of the Sunflower State. 

High-tax California and New York have added employment much faster than Kansas.",2016-10-26 23:07:55+00:00,d997upg,16.0,t1_d997d2c,712.0,politics

Except for the fact that Blanchard meant AGP ONLY applied to men. Since it can be shown that women also show signs of AGP using Blachard's OWN criteria, we can clearly show that AGP is not the correct diagnosis. 

Similar to antiquated ideas suggesting that homosexuality is a deviant sex-drive, Blanchard proposed that transsexuality is a mis-directed form of either heterosexuality (named “autogynephilia”) or homosexuality. 

Rather than asking the scientifically neutral question, “What does it mean to be transgender?” Blanchard asks, ""What kind of defect in a male's capacity for sexual learning could produce autogynephilic  transvestitism?""

(1) have never been replicated

(2) failed to include control groups of typically-gendered women

(3) drew conclusions about causality from entirely observational data. 

(4) failed to covary the acknowledged age-differences from ANOVA (Analysis of variance, ANOVA is a collection of statistical models used to analyze the differences among group means and their associated procedures such as ""variation"" among and between groups, developed by statistician and evolutionary biologist Ronald Fisher.)

There was no single reason why women have abortions in the second trimester: respondents reported a whole variety of reasons that explained their delay in seeking and obtaining an abortion. 

This includes:-

* A major reason for delay in the pathway to abortion was women not realising that they were pregnant.

* Much of the delay occurs prior to women requesting an abortion: half the women questioned were more than 13 weeks pregnant by the time they requested an abortion.

* Women’s concerns about what is involved in having the abortion are also important in creating delay.

* Various aspects of relationships with their partners and/or parents played a role in delays in women’s decision-making about whether to have an abortion.",2016-10-22 23:18:48+00:00,d93l5yp,2.0,t1_d93kznp,267.0,TwoXChromosomes

No it's not, you see a life, I see a collection of cells. Both are valid. Therefore, what you choose to do with your body if you are pregnant is up to you.

Nope, like i said, you see it as moral, i see a pill that people can take to get rid of a collection of cells. I do not imbue those collection of cells with any sentience whatsoever.

&gt; This subreddit seems a dictatorship. Why anyone who states such a simple fact is banned and bullied?

Because your opinion is shitty and it's wrong, and it speaks to your own internalized transphobia. 

&gt;Acknowledging a problem is the first step towards a real solution.

Only if you insist on seeing it as a problem.

&gt; ""this is a man"" or ""this used to be a man""

Gender policing much?

&gt;So, the casual observer will clock you but will be unable to tell you why.

Wow, just wow. That's just so off base I dont even know where to begin. You want me to prove you wrong? The Pacific Islanders have an appreciation of third genders, the fa'afafine have been recognized for generations streching back into the dim mists of human history.

The indigenous Zapotec culture of Oaxaca is not divided by the usual dichotomies: gay or straight, male or female. There's a commonly accepted third category of mixed gender — people called muxes.

Native Americans acknowledge two-spirit people who were said to be blessed from the touch of the gods. 

When you bring up crap like that, you're specifically referring to Western Judeo-Christian perceptions.

**This entire post is bullshit and biased, and I will advise everyone reading this to treat it like the piece of garbage that it is.**

876,"One more time, ""Autogynephilia"" is a sex-fueled mental illness made up by  Blanchard. He defines it as ""**a man's** paraphilic tendency to be sexually aroused by the thought or image of himself as a woman."" 

Blanchard first proposed the theory of autogynephilia in the late 1980's - it asserts that there are two fundamentally different types of trans women, and that only one of these groups (the so-called ""autogynephiles"") not only experience sexual arousal or fantasies involving the “thought or image of oneself as a woman"", but that those thoughts and fantasies are the cause of any gender dysphoria &amp; desire to transition that those individuals experience.

But the problem is that in *every single one* of Blanchard's research studies on the matter, he found a significant number of subjects who defied his two-subtype model and his assumption of causality (i.e., that their thoughts and fantasies are the supposed cause of transsexuality in those who experience them). Rather than question his model, Blanchard dismissed these many exceptions by accusing those research subjects of ""misreporting"" their experiences

To believe that Blanchard's autogynephilia theory is correct, you need to either 1) transport yourself back in time to around 2005, when the only scientific literature on this topic had been published by Ray Blanchard and his two biggest fans Anne Lawrence &amp; J. Michael Bailey, or 2) purposefully ignore all of the scientific/sexology literature that has been published since.",2016-10-21 17:00:07+00:00,d91ywr7,5.0,t1_d91szgb,7546.0,asktransgender

888,"Similar to antiquated ideas suggesting that homosexuality is a deviant sex-drive, Blanchard proposed that transsexuality is a mis-directed form of either heterosexuality (named “autogynephilia”) or homosexuality. 

Rather than asking the scientifically neutral question, “What does it mean to be transgender?” Blanchard asks, ""What kind of defect in a male's capacity for sexual learning could produce autogynephilic  transvestitism?""  
 
A balanced portrait of Blanchard’s key empirical findings would reveal that they: 

(1) have never been replicated

(2) failed to include control groups of typically-gendered women

(3) drew conclusions about causality from entirely observational data. 

(4) failed to covary the acknowledged age-differences from ANOVA (Analysis of variance, ANOVA is a collection of statistical models used to analyze the differences among group means and their associated procedures such as ""variation"" among and between groups, developed by statistician and evolutionary biologist Ronald Fisher.) 

Autogynephilia theory has been scientifically disproven, a small handful of somewhat prominent people in the field of sexology (most of whom have ties with one another: e.g., Ray Blanchard, J. Michael Bailey, Anne Lawrence, Alice Dreger, and James Cantor) continue to ignore the recent scientific record on this matter and present autogynephilia as though it were still a valid theory.

898,"Paraphrasing from ""A Cry For Help"" 

When somebody says to me, “I’m thinking about suicide, I have a plan.”  I hear someone who just needs a reason not to do it.

I think: Your depression has been beating you up for years. It’s called you ugly, and stupid, and pathetic, and a failure, for so long that you’ve forgotten that it’s wrong. You don’t see good in yourself, and you don’t have any hope.

But still, here you are; you’ve come over to me, banged on my door, and said, “HEY! Staying alive is REALLY HARD right now! Just give me something to fight with! I don’t care if it’s a stick! Give me a stick and I can stay alive!”

I think that’s incredible. You’re like a marine: Trapped for years behind enemy lines, your gun has been taken away, you’re out of ammo, you’re malnourished, and you’ve probably caught some kind of jungle virus that’s making you hallucinate giant spiders.

And you’re still just going “Give me a stick! I’m not dying out here!”

You don’t need my pity. This isn’t pathetic. This is the will to survive. This is how humans lived long enough to become the dominant species.

With NO hope, running on NOTHING, you’re ready to cut through a hundred miles of hostile jungle with nothing but a stick, if that’s what it takes to get to safety.

All I’m doing is handing out sticks.

You’re the one staying alive.

937,"If you want to get in the weeds, biological phenomena don’t necessarily fit into human-ordained binary categories. So while humans insist that you’re either male or female – that you have either XY or XX sex chromosomes – biology begs to differ.

Divergence from the normal number of X and Y chromosomes, called sex chromosome aneuploidy (SCA), accounts for approximately half of all chromosomal anomalies in humans, with a total frequency of 1:400 (Passarge, 1995). Aneuploidy occurs in at least 5% of all pregnancies, which is a relatively high frequency, and is the most commonly recognized chromosome abnormality in humans (Hassold and Hunt, 2001). Below are some examples:

*Turner Syndrome*: This disorder, also referred to as monosomy X (45X), occurs only in girls and women when the X chromosome is totally or partially missing. Although 45X is a frequent chromosomal anomaly, Turner syndrome is rare, with a live-birth frequency of 1:3,000 (Hook and Warburton, 1983). Affected individuals experience abnormal growth patterns, heart defects, and certain learning disabilities; they are short in stature; generally lack prominent female secondary sexual characteristics; and are sterile—features that in some individuals lead to social adjustment problems (The Mayo Clinic, 2016c).

*XXX Females*: Women with three X chromosomes (47XXX), referred to as Triple X syndrome, or trisomy X, experience normal development of sexual traits and are fertile. Affected individuals are usually taller than average and have slender builds and no severe phenotype, but may have a slight learning disorder (The Mayo Clinic, 2016b, U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2016). The frequency of women obtaining an extra X chromosome is approximately 1:1,000.

*Klinefelter Syndrome*: Klinefelter syndrome (47XXY or XY/XXY mosaic) is the most pervasive sex chromosomal anomaly (Klinefelter et al., 1942), affecting approximately 1 in 600 males (Nielsen and Wohlert, 1990). Males with Klinefelter syndrome carry two or more X chromosomes resulting in abnormal development of the testis, leading to hypogonadism and infertility (Bojesen et al., 2004). Affected males have incompletely developed secondary male sex characteristics, are often tall, have reductions in muscle mass, and produce relatively small amounts of T (The Mayo Clinic, 2016a).

*XYY Males*: Men inheriting an additional Y chromosome have higher than average levels of T and are usually taller than average and are prone to acne. Affected males are typically fertile, and many are unaware that they have a chromosomal abnormality. The frequency of males born with an additional Y chromosome is approximately 1:1,000.

A psychological state is considered a mental disorder only if it causes significant distress or disability. Many transgender people do not experience their gender as distressing or disabling, which implies that **identifying as transgender does not constitute a mental disorder**. 

we are not disordered, for three primary reasons: one, we show some basis in fact for our identification; two, unlike true delusional or somatoform disorders (which seem the most obvious comparison), psychiatric medication does not affect our feelings; and three, unlike true delusional/somatoform disorders, allowing us to pursue our feelings is far from destructive and in fact has exceptionally well-demonstrated positive results.
As best we can tell, gender identity is at least partially determined by brain structure formed very early in fetal development. A few studies show patterns typical of our identified gender and not of our birth sex.
Moreover, transgenderism correlates strongly with endocrine conditions - if we look at people born with externally female bodies, those with PCOS (which raises testosterone) are much more likely to ultimately identify as men; those with CAIS (which makes their bodies incapable of responding to testosterone) almost never do, to the point that single cases merit publication in their own right. On top of that, digit ratio (a marker of prenatal testosterone exposure) displays markedly low T exposure on average in trans women and high T exposure in trans men.
There's even some experimental evidence that, when cis (=not trans) people are categorized contrary to their birth sex, they experience the same distress that trans people do. Under the assumption that gender is malleable to social expectations, David Reimer was raised as a girl after a botched circumcision. He found himself uncomfortable with the female role, displayed symptoms typical of what would be expected of a trans man (that's FTM, to be clear), and ultimately transitioned to living as a man as soon as he became aware of his status in his early teens. And on the flip side, an author named Norah Vincent spent a year living as a man for the purposes of writing a book. By the end of that time, she was so depressed she checked herself into a mental institution because she was worried she might harm herself.
Additionally, trans feelings simply don't respond to psychiatric medication designed to 'cure' them. No professional organization in the world - even those that do classify us as a mental illness for (I feel) mostly historical/political reasons - recommends just giving us SSRIs or the like and sending us away. Traditional therapies simply do not work.
Compare this with Body Dysmorphic Disorder, a disorder that could be seen as an analog to trans people. BDD sufferers fixate on a small (e.g., a mole) or nonexistent part of their bodies, which they believe makes them hideous and unlovable. Some seek out treatment to remove the offending part. But BDD, unlike trans people, responds well to both therapy and SSRIs and does not respond to their desired interventions.",2016-10-17 18:51:59+00:00,d8w373r,10.0,t1_d8w2ndi,652.0,atheism

1000,"So lemme break down that transphobic bullshit. Do you even science? Biology doesn’t work that way. Biological phenomena don’t necessarily fit into human-ordained binary categories. So while humans insist that you’re either male or female – that you have either XY or XX sex chromosomes – biology begs to differ.

Divergence from the normal number of X and Y chromosomes, called sex chromosome aneuploidy (SCA), accounts for approximately half of all chromosomal anomalies in humans, with a total frequency of 1:400 (Passarge, 1995). Aneuploidy occurs in at least 5% of all pregnancies, which is a relatively high frequency, and is the most commonly recognized chromosome abnormality in humans (Hassold and Hunt, 2001). Below are some examples:

*Turner Syndrome*: This disorder, also referred to as monosomy X (45X), occurs only in girls and women when the X chromosome is totally or partially missing. Although 45X is a frequent chromosomal anomaly, Turner syndrome is rare, with a live-birth frequency of 1:3,000 (Hook and Warburton, 1983). Affected individuals experience abnormal growth patterns, heart defects, and certain learning disabilities; they are short in stature; generally lack prominent female secondary sexual characteristics; and are sterile—features that in some individuals lead to social adjustment problems (The Mayo Clinic, 2016c).

*XXX Females*: Women with three X chromosomes (47XXX), referred to as Triple X syndrome, or trisomy X, experience normal development of sexual traits and are fertile. Affected individuals are usually taller than average and have slender builds and no severe phenotype, but may have a slight learning disorder (The Mayo Clinic, 2016b, U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2016). The frequency of women obtaining an extra X chromosome is approximately 1:1,000.

*Klinefelter Syndrome*: Klinefelter syndrome (47XXY or XY/XXY mosaic) is the most pervasive sex chromosomal anomaly (Klinefelter et al., 1942), affecting approximately 1 in 600 males (Nielsen and Wohlert, 1990). Males with Klinefelter syndrome carry two or more X chromosomes resulting in abnormal development of the testis, leading to hypogonadism and infertility (Bojesen et al., 2004). Affected males have incompletely developed secondary male sex characteristics, are often tall, have reductions in muscle mass, and produce relatively small amounts of T (The Mayo Clinic, 2016a).

*XYY Males*: Men inheriting an additional Y chromosome have higher than average levels of T and are usually taller than average and are prone to acne. Affected males are typically fertile, and many are unaware that they have a chromosomal abnormality. The frequency of males born with an additional Y chromosome is approximately 1:1,000.

And as for pronouns, You will refer to her using female pronouns because that's what it says on her documentation. But even if her documents didnt reflect her proper gender, the fact that you cannot even do her the common courtesy of addressing her with the proper pronouns speaks volumes about your bigotry.

&gt;If the science is against me on this topic then please show me a single study where specifically trans people are shown to not have any mental problems. 

you want to quote studies??? There are far more studies that show that transitioning alleviates dysphoria.

[ After gender reassignment, in young adulthood, the GD was alleviated and psychological functioning had steadily improved. ](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958.abstract)

[Allowing Transgender Youth To Transition Improves Their Mental Health, Study Finds](http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2015/03/10/3631788/letting-transgender-kids-transition-is-for-their-own-good/)

[Heylans et al., 2014](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12363/abstract): ""A difference in SCL-90 [a test of distress, anxiety, and hostility] overall psychoneurotic distress was observed at the different points of assessments (P = 0.003), with the most prominent decrease occurring after the initiation of hormone therapy (P &lt; 0.001)...Furthermore, the SCL-90 scores resembled those of a general population after hormone therapy was initiated.""

[Colizzi et al., 2013](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12155/abstract): ""At enrollment, transsexuals reported elevated CAR ['cortisol awakening response', a physiological measure of stress]; their values were out of normal. They expressed higher perceived stress and more attachment insecurity, with respect to normative sample data. When treated with hormone therapy [at followup, 1 year after beginning HRT], transsexuals reported significantly lower CAR (P &lt; 0.001), falling within the normal range for cortisol levels. Treated transsexuals showed also lower perceived stress (P &lt; 0.001), with levels similar to normative samples.""

[Gomez-Gil et al., 2012](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21937168): ""SADS, HAD-A, and HAD-Depression (HAD-D) mean scores [these are tests of depression and anxiety] were significantly higher among patients who had not begun cross-sex hormonal treatment compared with patients in hormonal treatment (F=4.362, p=.038; F=14.589, p=.001; F=9.523, p=.002 respectively). Similarly, current symptoms of anxiety and depression were present in a significantly higher percentage of untreated patients than in treated patients (61% vs. 33% and 31% vs. 8% respectively).""

de Vries, et al., 2014 studied 55 trans teens from the onset of treatment in their early teenage years through a follow-up an average of 7 years later. They found no negative outcomes, no regrets, and in fact their group was slightly mentally healthier than non-trans controls.

[Lawrence, 2003](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1024086814364) surveyed post-op trans folk: ""Participants reported overwhelmingly that they were happy with their SRS results and that SRS had greatly improved the quality of their lives. None reported outright regret and only a few expressed even occasional regret.""

Yes, and thankfully, medical science disagrees with you. When doctors diagnose gender dysphoria, especially at her age, it's not just ""for a couple of years"".

First off, it's not a phase, secondly, she's had all her documentation changed, so please address her using female pronouns. Third, it's not like a tattoo, gender identity if a fundamental part of who we are. We dont do this for the shits and gigglies, do you think we WANT to be trans? Do you know how much crap we have to take on a daily basis? The side eye, the snickers, the finger pointing.... I wouldnt wish this on my worst enemy.

1008,"gender dysphoria isnt the same as body dysmorphia.

Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), or body dysmorphia, is an anxiety disorder that causes sufferers to spend a lot of time worrying about their appearance and to have a distorted view of how they look.

Gender dysphoria is a condition where a person experiences discomfort or distress because there is a mismatch between their biological sex and gender identity...This mismatch between sex and gender identity can lead to distressing and uncomfortable feelings that are called gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is a recognised medical condition, for which treatment is sometimes appropriate. It is not a mental illness.

Those who suffer from body dysmorphia have a disconnection between the reality they are perceiving and how that perception is recognised in their brains. They look in an ordinary mirror, but for them, the result is something like we might imagine a funhouse mirror to look.

Body dysmorphia does not appear to have a specific medical treatment, although counseling and antidepressant medications are recommended. Surgery is NOT a treatment.

 It is substantially different in that one of the strongest aspects of gender dysphoria for many (but not all!) individuals who have those feelings is an acute awareness of what their physical features actually are and why those features do not match up with the gender presentation expected of the gender with which they identify.

And if acute awareness of physicality is an aspect of gender dysphoria which is precisely opposite of the defining aspect of body dysmorphia, it should follow that physical changes as the result of medical intervention would generally lead to solving feelings of dysphoria (unlike surgery for those with body dysmorphia which actually can cause more harm). And indeed, that has repeatedly been shown to be the case in [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12856892), after [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17075731), after [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19619147), after [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21699661), even with the potential for complications and need for future medical intervention post-operation for both trans women and trans men.

The current Board of Directors of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) expresses its conviction that sex (gender) reassignment, properly indicated and performed as provided by the Standards of Care, has proven to be beneficial and effective in the treatment of individuals with transsexualism, gender identity disorder, and/or gender dysphoria. Sex reassignment plays an undisputed role in contributing toward favorable outcomes, and comprises Real Life Experience, legal name and sex change on identity documents, as well as medically necessary hormone treatment, counseling, psychotherapy, and other medical procedures. 

Medically necessary sex reassignment procedures also include complete hysterectomy, bilateral mastectomy, chest reconstruction or augmentation as appropriate to each patient (including breast prostheses if necessary), genital reconstruction (by various techniques which must be appropriate to each patient, including, for example, skin flap hair removal, penile and testicular prostheses, as necessary), facial hair removal, and certain facial plastic reconstruction as appropriate to the patient.

""Non-genital surgical procedures are routinely performed... notably, subcutaneous mastectomy in female-to-male transsexuals, and facial feminization surgery, and/or breast augmentation in male-to-female transsexuals. These surgical interventions are often of greater practical significance in the patient's daily life than reconstruction of the genitals.""  


Furthermore, not every patient will have a medical need for identical procedures; clinically appropriate treatments must be determined on an individualized basis with the patient's physician.

 

The medical procedures attendant to sex reassignment are not ""cosmetic"" or ""elective"" or for the mere convenience of the patient. These reconstructive procedures are not optional in any meaningful sense, but are understood to be medically necessary for the treatment of the diagnosed condition.

1055,"Actually, yes you're ignorant and your opinion isnt based on scientific fact. The idea of two sexes is simplistic. Biologists now think there is a wider spectrum than that. But doctors have long known that some people straddle the boundary — their sex chromosomes say one thing, but their gonads (ovaries or testes) or sexual anatomy say another. When genetics is taken into consideration, the boundary between the sexes becomes even blurrier. What's more, new technologies in DNA sequencing and cell biology are revealing that almost everyone is, to varying degrees, a patchwork of genetically distinct cells, some with a sex that might not match that of the rest of their body. Biologists may have been building a more nuanced view of sex, but society has yet to catch up. 

The following are scientific studies that show that both sex and gender lie on a spectrum.

**Genetics**  
The androgen receptor (AR), also known as NR3C4, is activated by the binding of testosterone or dihydrotestosterone, where it plays a critical role in the forming of primary and secondary male sex characteristics. Hare et al. found that male-to-female transsexuals were found to have longer repetitions of the gene, which reduced its effectiveness at binding testosterone.

A variant genotype for a gene called CYP17, which acts on the sex hormones pregnenolone and progesterone, has been found to be linked to female-to-male transsexualism but not MTF transsexualism. Most notably, the FTM subjects not only had the variant genotype more frequently, but had an allele distribution equivalent to male controls, unlike the female controls. The paper concluded that the loss of a female-specific CYP17 T -34C allele distribution pattern is associated with FtM transsexualism.

**Brain structure**  
In a first-of-its-kind study, Zhou et al. (1995) found that in a region of the brain called the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTc), a region known for sex and anxiety responses, MTF transsexuals have a female-normal size while FTM transsexuals have a male-normal size. While the transsexuals studied had taken hormones, this was accounted for by including non-transsexual male and female controls who, for a variety of medical reasons, had experienced hormone reversal. The controls still retained sizes typical for their gender. No relationship to sexual orientation was found.

In a follow-up study, Kruijver et al. (2000) looked at the number of neurons in BSTc instead of volumes. They found the same results as Zhou et al. (1995), but with even more dramatic differences. One MTF subject who had never gone on hormones was also included, and who matched up with the female neuron counts nonetheless.

In 2002, a follow-up study by Chung et al. found that significant sexual dimorphism (variation between sexes) in BSTc did not become established until adulthood. Chung et al. theorized that either changes in fetal hormone levels produce changes in BSTc synaptic density, neuronal activity, or neurochemical content which later lead to size and neuron count changes in BSTc, or that the size of BSTc is affected by the failure to generate a gender identity consistent with one's anatomic sex.

In a review of the evidence in 2006, Gooren confirms the earlier research as supporting the concept that transsexualism is a sexual differentiation disorder of the sex dimorphic brain. Dick Swaab (2004) concurs.

In 2008, a new region with properties similar to that of BSTc in regards to transsexualism was found by Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab: the interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH3), part of the hypothalamic uncinate nucleus. The same method of controlling for hormone usage was used as in Zhou et al. (1995) and Kruijver et al. (2000). The differences were even more pronounced than with BSTc; control males averaged 1.9 times the volume and 2.3 times the neurons as control females, yet once again, regardless of hormone exposure, MTF transsexuals lay within the female range and the FTM transsexual within the male range.

While the resolution of MRI tomographs in general can be fine enough, independent nuclei are not visible due to lack of contrast between different neurological tissue types. Therefore, such images do not show detailed structures such as BSTc and INAH3, and studies on BSTC were done by bisecting brains postmortem.

However, MRI does much more easily allow the study of larger brain structures. In Luders et al. (2009), 24 MTF transsexuals not-yet treated with cross-sex hormones were studied via MRI. While regional gray matter concentrations were more similar to men than women, there was a significantly larger volume of gray matter in the right putamen compared to men. As with many earlier studies, they concluded that transsexualism is associated with a distinct cerebral pattern.

An additional feature was studied in a group of FTM transsexuals who had not yet received cross-sex hormones: fractional anisotropy values for white matter in the medial and posterior parts of the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), the forceps minor, and the corticospinal tract. Rametti et al. (2010) discovered that, ""Compared to control females, FtM showed higher FA values in posterior part of the right SLF, the forceps minor and corticospinal tract. Compared to control males, FtM showed only lower FA values in the corticospinal tract.""

Hulshoff Pol et al. (2006), studied the gross brain volume of subjects undergoing hormone treatment. They discovered that whole brain volume for subjects changes toward the size of the opposite sex during hormone treatment. The conclusion of the study was, ""The findings suggest that, throughout life, gonadal hormones remain essential for maintaining aspects of sex-specific differences in the human brain.""

**Brain plasticity**  
Brain structure differences associated with transsexualism do not exist in isolation. Similar brain structure differences have been noted between gay and heterosexual men, and between lesbian and heterosexual women.

More recent studies have found that circumstance and repeated activities such as meditation modify brain structures in a process called brain plasticity or neuroplasticity. In May 2014, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reported that parenting ""rewires the male brain"" for fathers.

**Brain function**  
Phantom limb syndrome is a common, often painful experience after the loss of an external organ. Ramachandran (2008) found that while nearly two thirds of non-transsexual males who have a penis surgically removed experience the sensation of a phantom penis, only one third of MTF transsexuals do so after sex reassignment surgery. This study, however, overlooks the differences between an amputation, where the nerves connecting the penis and the brain are severed, and male-to-female gender reassignment surgery, where some of the penis and scrotum may be reused to create a vaginal canal, labia and a clitoris. In this case, some of the nerves connecting the new genitalia to the brain remain largely intact. Also, two-thirds of FTM transsexuals reported the sensation of a phantom penis from childhood onwards, complete with phantom erections and other phenomena.

Berglund et al. (2008) tested the response of gynephilic MTF transsexuals to two sex pheromones: the progestin-like 4,16-androstadien-3-one (AND) and the estrogen-like 1,3,5(10),16-tetraen-3-ol (EST). Despite the difference in sexuality, the MTFs' hypothalamic networks activated in response to AND, like the androphilic female control groups. Both groups experienced amygdala activation in response to EST. Male control groups (gynephilic) experienced hypothalamic activation in response to EST. However, the MTF subjects also experienced limited hypothalamic activation to EST as well. The researchers' conclusion was, that in terms of pheromone activation, MTF's occupy an intermediate position with predominantly female features.[17] The MTF transsexual subjects had not undergone any hormonal treatment at the time of the study, according to their own declaration beforehand, and confirmed by repeated tests of hormonal levels.

**Transsexuality among twins**  
In a 2013 study based on previously published research and conducted surveys it was found that in 39 coming from a single fertilized egg, monozygotic twin male pairs, 13 (33%) identified both of themselves as transsexual. This was found in 8 of 25 (22.5%) female pairs. Alternatively only 1 out of 38 (2.6%) coming from different fertilized eggs, dizygotic male and female pairs identified themselves as transsexual. The significant percentage of transsexual identification in both of the identical twins, and the virtual absence of this correspondence in dizygotic twins raised in the same family at the same time, supports the argument that one's transsexual identity is significantly influenced by genetics.

**Prenatal androgen exposure**  
Prenatal androgen exposure, the lack thereof, or poor sensitivity to prenatal androgens are commonly cited mechanisms to explain the above discoveries. Schneider, Pickel, and Stalla (2006) found a correlation between digit ratio (a generally accepted marker for prenatal androgen exposure) and male to female transsexualism. MTF transsexuals were found to have a higher digit ratio than control males, but one that was comparable to control females.",2016-10-17 02:31:11+00:00,d8v7157,6.0,t1_d8v6go0,788.0,atheism

Biological phenomena don’t necessarily fit into human-ordained binary categories. So while humans insist that you’re either male or female – that you have either XY or XX sex chromosomes – biology begs to differ.

Divergence from the normal number of X and Y chromosomes, called sex chromosome aneuploidy (SCA), accounts for approximately half of all chromosomal anomalies in humans, with a total frequency of 1:400 (Passarge, 1995). Aneuploidy occurs in at least 5% of all pregnancies, which is a relatively high frequency, and is the most commonly recognized chromosome abnormality in humans (Hassold and Hunt, 2001). Below are some examples:

*Turner Syndrome*: This disorder, also referred to as monosomy X (45X), occurs only in girls and women when the X chromosome is totally or partially missing. Although 45X is a frequent chromosomal anomaly, Turner syndrome is rare, with a live-birth frequency of 1:3,000 (Hook and Warburton, 1983). Affected individuals experience abnormal growth patterns, heart defects, and certain learning disabilities; they are short in stature; generally lack prominent female secondary sexual characteristics; and are sterile—features that in some individuals lead to social adjustment problems (The Mayo Clinic, 2016c).

*XXX Females*: Women with three X chromosomes (47XXX), referred to as Triple X syndrome, or trisomy X, experience normal development of sexual traits and are fertile. Affected individuals are usually taller than average and have slender builds and no severe phenotype, but may have a slight learning disorder (The Mayo Clinic, 2016b, U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2016). The frequency of women obtaining an extra X chromosome is approximately 1:1,000.

*Klinefelter Syndrome*: Klinefelter syndrome (47XXY or XY/XXY mosaic) is the most pervasive sex chromosomal anomaly (Klinefelter et al., 1942), affecting approximately 1 in 600 males (Nielsen and Wohlert, 1990). Males with Klinefelter syndrome carry two or more X chromosomes resulting in abnormal development of the testis, leading to hypogonadism and infertility (Bojesen et al., 2004). Affected males have incompletely developed secondary male sex characteristics, are often tall, have reductions in muscle mass, and produce relatively small amounts of T (The Mayo Clinic, 2016a).

*XYY Males*: Men inheriting an additional Y chromosome have higher than average levels of T and are usually taller than average and are prone to acne. Affected males are typically fertile, and many are unaware that they have a chromosomal abnormality. The frequency of males born with an additional Y chromosome is approximately 1:1,000.",2016-10-17 01:39:26+00:00,d8v4twd,4.0,t1_d8v4oma,212.0,atheism

You can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapours; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a miniraft down the slow heavy River Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a mind-bogglingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't see you — daft as a brush, but very very ravenous); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course you can dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough.

More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value. For some reason, if a strag (strag: nonhitchhiker) discovers that a hitchhiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush, washcloth, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet-weather gear, space suit etc., etc. Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitchhiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitchhiker might accidentally have ""lost.""

I'm talking about the ones with insistent, consistent, and persistent gender dysphoria. Our gender identity is set by the 6th month of gestation, asking a transgender 12 year old to wait until they are 16 before starting hormones does more harm than good.

Zucker did that study, and I trust him as far as I can throw him Perhaps the clearest evidence that most children in these samples were never transgender to begin with is that, when they were directly asked “are you a boy or a girl” as part of a battery of intake questions, an overwhelming percentage (more than 90 percent) of children in these clinics provided the answer that aligned with their natal sex. Is it so surprising that the majority of boys who in childhood believed themselves to be boys in adulthood believed themselves to be men? As one research team based in Amsterdam concluded: “[E]xplicitly asking children with GD [gender dysphoria] with which sex they identify seems to be of great value in predicting future outcomes for both boys and girls with GD.” That is, even within samples of gender nonconforming children, the ones who say they are the other gender are the ones who are most likely to say the same thing later in life.

Gender is set by the 6th month of gestation, one's gender doesnt change. Children are aware of their gender at 18 months.

So again, there is no issue with starting them on hrt so that they can go through puberty along with their peers. 

Now with those who arent sure, then they should be administered with hormone blockers to delay puberty and give them more time.

But it should be left up to the medical professional who is overseeing the child's care.

Furthermore, [a study with 32 transgender children, ages 5 to 12, indicates that the gender identity of these children is deeply held and is not the result of confusion about gender identity or pretense. ](http://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-01-transgender-kids-gender-identity.html) The study is one of the first to explore gender identity in transgender children using implicit measures that operate outside conscious awareness and are, therefore, less susceptible to modification than self-report measures.


[ Socially transitioned transgender children who are supported in their gender identity have developmentally normative levels of depression and only minimal elevations in anxiety, suggesting that psychopathology is not inevitable within this group. Especially striking is the comparison with reports of children with GID; socially transitioned transgender children have notably lower rates of internalizing psychopathology than previously reported among children with GID living as their natal sex.](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2016/02/24/peds.2015-3223)

We will soon have more data as [the largest ever study of transgender teenagers is set to kick off.](http://www.nature.com/news/largest-ever-study-of-transgender-teenagers-set-to-kick-off-1.19637)",2016-10-11 17:11:50+00:00,d8njxrb,4.0,t1_d8n5tjk,22114.0,TransSpace
1154,"For starters, the most cited study ([Steensma](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21216800)) which alleges a 84 percent desistance rate, did not actually differentiate between children with consistent, persistent and insistent gender dysphoria, kids who socially transitioned, and kids who just acted more masculine or feminine than their birth sex and culture allowed for. 

In other words, it treated gender non-conformance the same as gender dysphoria. Worse, the study could not locate 45.3 percent of the children for follow up, and made the assumption that all of them were desisters. Indeed, other studies used to support this also suffered from similar methodological flaws.

As a result, the 84 percent desistance figure is meaningless, since both the numerator and denominator are unknown, because you have no idea how many of the kids ended up transitioning (numerator), and no idea how many of them were actually gender dysphoric to begin with (denominator). When Dr. Steensma [went back in 2013](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23702447)  and looked at the intensity of dysphoria these children felt as a factor in persistence, it turned out that it was actually a very good predictor of which children would transition.

In other words, the children who actually met the clinical guidelines for gender dysphoria as children generally ended up as transgender adults. [Further research has shown](http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/03/05/0956797614568156) that children who meet the clinical guidelines for gender dysphoria are as consistent in their gender identity as the general population.",2016-10-11 17:07:06+00:00,d8njp9h,8.0,t1_d8nhuvr,2202.0,TransSpace

what's false the the fucking claim.

&gt;CLAIM: Police shootings kill more white Americans than black Americans.

Read ALL the words

&gt;According to Fatal Encounters, the database created by former Reno News &amp; Review editor and journalism instructor Burghart (which tracks all deaths resulting from interactions with police), a total of 1,388 people were killed by police in 2015, 318 (23%) of them black, and 560 (40%) of them white. So roughly 23 percent of those killed by any police interaction in 2015 were black and just over 40 percent were white. According to those statistics (adjusted for racial demographics), blacks had a 2.7 higher likelihood of being killed by police than whites.

&gt;The grim trend has carried over into 2016. Of the 1,034 people killed and tracked by Burghart's Fatal Encounters database so far this year, 215 were black while 338 were white, so thus far in 2016 black Americans have been three times more likely than whites to die in interactions with police.

Comparing how many or how often white people are killed by police to how many or how often black people are killed by the police is statistically dubious unless you first adjust for population.

According to the most recent census data, there are nearly 160 million more white people in America than there are black people. White people make up roughly 62 percent of the U.S. population but only about 49 percent of those who are killed by police officers. African Americans, however, account for 24 percent of those fatally shot and killed by the police despite being just 13 percent of the U.S. population. 

**That means black Americans are 2.5 times as likely as white Americans to be shot and killed by police officers.**

""These loans breached insurance regulations and as a result of this the Financial Regulator has sanctioned Quinn Insurance and myself.

What’s more, given the size of that original fortune, Trump has actually underperformed both the stock market as well as the real estate market.

Had Trump taken his share of what would become his father’s inheritance and put it into an index fund matching the S&amp;P 500 back in 1974, it would have been worth $3 billion today. Had he put the $200 million that Fortune magazine determined he was worth in 1982 into that same index fund, he would be worth more than $8 billion today.

[Polling from the 1960s reveals that the Civil Rights Movement was overwhelmingly less popular than Black Lives Matter is today.  ](http://www.crmvet.org/docs/60s_crm_public-opinion.pdf)

 Decades of police brutality, capped off by several incidents in the summer of 1964 led to a series of racially-motivated riots in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Jersey City.

When police shot an unarmed black teenager in Harlem in July 1964, tensions escalated out of control. Residents were frustrated with racial inequalities. Rioting broke out, and Bedford-Stuyvesant, a major black neighborhood in Brooklyn erupted next. That summer, rioting also broke out in Philadelphia, for similar reasons. The riots were on a much smaller scale than what would occur in 1965 and later.

Riots among blacks protesting against police brutality occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as Atlanta, San Francisco, Oakland, Baltimore, Seattle, Tacoma, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Columbus, Newark, Chicago, New York City (specifically in Brooklyn, Harlem and the Bronx), and worst of all in Detroit.

In addition to Detroit, over 100 US cities experienced riots in 1967, including Newark, Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Washington D.C.

 President Johnson created the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders in 1967. The commission's final report called for major reforms in employment and public assistance for black communities. It warned that the United States was moving toward separate white and black societies.

In April 1968 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in Memphis, Tennessee, rioting broke out in cities across the country from frustration and despair. These included Cleveland, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Chicago, New York City and Louisville, Kentucky. As in previous riots, most of the damage was done in black neighborhoods. In some cities, it has taken more than a quarter of a century for these areas to recover from the damage of the riots; in others, little recovery has been achieved.

1343,"Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), or body dysmorphia, is an anxiety disorder that causes sufferers to spend a lot of time worrying about their appearance and to have a distorted view of how they look.

Gender dysphoria is a condition where a person experiences discomfort or distress because there is a mismatch between their biological sex and gender identity...This mismatch between sex and gender identity can lead to distressing and uncomfortable feelings that are called gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is a recognised medical condition, for which treatment is sometimes appropriate.

Those who suffer from body dysmorphia have a disconnection between the reality they are perceiving and how that perception is recognised in their brains. They look in an ordinary mirror, but for them, the result is something like we might imagine a funhouse mirror to look.

Body dysmorphia does not appear to have a specific medical treatment, although counseling and antidepressant medications are recommended. Surgery is NOT a treatment.

 It is substantially different in that one of the strongest aspects of gender dysphoria for many (but not all!) individuals who have those feelings is an acute awareness of what their physical features actually are and why those features do not match up with the gender presentation expected of the gender with which they identify.

And if acute awareness of physicality is an aspect of gender dysphoria which is precisely opposite of the defining aspect of body dysmorphia, it should follow that physical changes as the result of medical intervention would generally lead to solving feelings of dysphoria (unlike surgery for those with body dysmorphia which actually can cause more harm).

1439,"Paraphrasing from ""A Cry For Help"" 

When somebody says to me, “I’m thinking about suicide, I have a plan.”  I hear someone who just needs a reason not to do it.

I think: Your depression has been beating you up for years. It’s called you ugly, and stupid, and pathetic, and a failure, for so long that you’ve forgotten that it’s wrong. You don’t see good in yourself, and you don’t have any hope.

But still, here you are; you’ve come over to me, banged on my door, and said, “HEY! Staying alive is REALLY HARD right now! Just give me something to fight with! I don’t care if it’s a stick! Give me a stick and I can stay alive!”

I think that’s incredible. You’re like a marine: Trapped for years behind enemy lines, your gun has been taken away, you’re out of ammo, you’re malnourished, and you’ve probably caught some kind of jungle virus that’s making you hallucinate giant spiders.

And you’re still just going “Give me a stick! I’m not dying out here!”

You don’t need my pity. This isn’t pathetic. This is the will to survive. This is how humans lived long enough to become the dominant species.

With NO hope, running on NOTHING, you’re ready to cut through a hundred miles of hostile jungle with nothing but a stick, if that’s what it takes to get to safety.

All I’m doing is handing out sticks.

You’re the one staying alive.

You're not fake. You are not a crude imitation of a woman. You can do this. ",2016-09-27 19:37:21+00:00,d84ippf,1.0,t3_54rfes,11034.0,asktransgender

1457,"Well, that's a lot to unpack, but allow me to mount a defense. (I'm pulling info from various sources)

&gt;She's a liar

Politifact determined that Hillary was actually the most truthful candidate (of either Party) in the 2016 election season. And in general Politifact has determined that Hillary is more honest than most (but not all) politicians they have tracked over the years.

Jill Abramson, a former reporter for the Wall Street Journal as well as former Executive Editor of the New York Times, had this to say about Hillary’s honesty: “As an editor I’ve launched investigations into her business dealings, her fundraising, her foundation and her marriage. As a reporter my stories stretch back to Whitewater. I’m not a favorite in Hillaryland. That makes what I want to say next surprising. Hillary Clinton is fundamentally honest and trustworthy.”

&gt;a criminal

Multiple investigations often undertaken by people who were LOOKING for anything to incriminate her have so far come up with nothing, and this dates back to her time as First Lady.

&gt;Whitewater

Every single accusation against her was proven wrong.

&gt;email server

Here's how that convo went,

Hillary: ""If i move the server off site, will it still be secure?""

IT team: ""Yes, ma'am.""

Hillary: ""Make it so.""

Now even if she was a sys admin, she'd have been far too busy as Secretary of State to go over all the security protocls to properly secure her server. And here's a little inside info, emails at State are a living nightmare, my friends who work there regal me to no end about how convoluted the rules are regarding the looging of emails, which include making a hardcopy of ALL the incoming AND outgoing emails. Here's another inside story, her initial IT team secured that server seven ways from sunday. The team that took over for them? Well, let's just say that one of them went on Reddit to ask a question about email server configurations.

&gt;about how she gave Debbie Schultz a place on her campaign

It's an honorary position with no power or authority whatsoever, it's a title because of the way she got kicked out. It's Hillary's way of thanking her for the years of service. 

When she declared she was going to run for the Senate, you know what happened? She was at one of the most popular periods of her life, but as soon as she declared a run for the Senate her favorables plummeted while her unfavorables rose sharply. Then once she was elected, her scores stabilized and even improved. 

Nearly exactly at the same time she withdrew from the Presidential race her favorables took off again, rising to levels that many considered remarkable. (Or are we pretending not to remember that until very recently Hillary was one of the most popular politicians in the country?) 

Her polling stayed high right up until she decided to run for President again. I think we all know what happened to her favorables.

What I see is that the public view of Hillary Clinton does not seem to be correlated to “scandals” or issues of character or whether she murdered Vince Foster. No, the one thing that seems to most negatively and consistently affect public perception of Hillary is any attempt by her to seek power. Once she actually has that power her polls go up again. But whenever she asks for it her numbers drop like a manhole cover.

Scandals — Webster’s dictionary defines a scandal as, “an occurrence in which people are shocked and upset because of behavior that is morally or legally wrong.” But here’s a question: Are scandals still scandals if nobody actually did anything wrong? And I think that’s a fair question, because Hillary’s political foes love to point out all the times she has been implicated (directly or indirectly) in scandals. Not surprisingly, however, they fail to point out that she has always been cleared of any wrongdoing.

And let’s talk about the more cerebral cousin of the appearance agreement, which is the speaking engagement. Is $200k really that unusual? In fact “All American Speakers”, the agency that represents Clinton, currently represents 135 people whose MINIMUM speaking fee is $200,000. Some of the luminaries that get paid this much include: Guy Fieri, Ang Lee, Carla Delevingne, Chelsea Handler, Elon Musk, Mehmet Oz, Michael Phelps, Nate Berkus, and “Larry the Cable Guy”. And no that last one is not a joke. And if you drop the speaking fee to $100k, the number of people they represent jumps to over 500. At $50,000 the number jumps to over 1,200. And All American Speakers are obviously not the only agency that represents speakers. So there are in fact thousands of people getting paid this kind of money to give a speech.

Wall Street — First things first. No, the majority of the money Clinton has made from speaking fees did not come from Wall Street. In fact it’s not even close. She has given nearly 100 paid speeches since leaving the State Dept., and only 8 were to “Wall Street” banks. Nearly all of her speeches were to organizations like American Camping Association, Ebay, Cisco, Xerox, Cardiovascular Research Foundation, United Fresh Produce Association, International Deli-Dairy-Bakery Association, California Medial Association, A&amp;E Television Networks, Massachusetts Conference for Women, U.S. Green Building Council, National Association of Realtors, American Society of Travel Agents, Gap, National Association of Convenience Stores, the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, etc.

She is one of the most qualified people to ever run for office, I am quite confident that she will make a great president.",2016-09-26 00:38:47+00:00,d820yrv,4.0,t1_d81k2u1,23079.0,politics

[Ky Peterson](http://www.advocate.com/politics/transgender/2015/04/08/black-trans-man-prison-killing-his-rapist) being one of the cases of a trans man I remember the most vividly.

How about, ""Trans people who are incarcerated are at the mercy of the court system as far as which gender they are perceived as."" (I'd like the girls to chime in too)

Then you can put in the rest of your opinion:-

""Trans men may not have male privilege as far as the institutionalized benefits men receive that women do not.

No, you do not have male privilege because people respect you more now, or because you are taken more seriously. That is not an institutionalized privilege.

If you are arrested, you might be put in solitary confinement within a female prison. If you get sick, you might be considered female by your doctors. You will be completely at their mercy, and they may even hurt you. You may not, however, be treated with the assumption of helplessness that females are treated with, and you may not be considered as delicate or as incapable of doing harm.
This is institutionalized discrimination. We can't fight it if we keep lying to ourselves.

(I just read another dumb article written by a cis woman about male privilege. Yes, she wrote it as if she were a trans man, and pretended to be a trans man in the article. I read these all the time but I'm still pissed)""

The racial policy of Nazi Germany included policies and laws implemented in Nazi Germany (1933–45) based on a specific racist doctrine asserting the superiority of the Aryan race, which claimed scientific legitimacy. This was combined with a eugenics programme that aimed for racial hygiene by compulsory sterilization and extermination of the Untermenschen (""sub-humans""), which eventually culminated in the Holocaust. Nazi policies labeled Jews, Romani people, Slavs (Poles, Serbs etc.) and persons of color as inferior non-Aryan subhumans in a racial hierarchy that placed the Herrenvolk (""master race"") of the Volksgemeinschaft (""people's community"") at the top.

Biological phenomena don’t necessarily fit into human-ordained binary categories. So while humans insist that you’re either male or female – that you have either XY or XX sex chromosomes – biology begs to differ.

Divergence from the normal number of X and Y chromosomes, called sex chromosome aneuploidy (SCA), accounts for approximately half of all chromosomal anomalies in humans, with a total frequency of 1:400 (Passarge, 1995). Aneuploidy occurs in at least 5% of all pregnancies, which is a relatively high frequency, and is the most commonly recognized chromosome abnormality in humans (Hassold and Hunt, 2001). Below are some examples:

*Turner Syndrome*: This disorder, also referred to as monosomy X (45X), occurs only in girls and women when the X chromosome is totally or partially missing. Although 45X is a frequent chromosomal anomaly, Turner syndrome is rare, with a live-birth frequency of 1:3,000 (Hook and Warburton, 1983). Affected individuals experience abnormal growth patterns, heart defects, and certain learning disabilities; they are short in stature; generally lack prominent female secondary sexual characteristics; and are sterile—features that in some individuals lead to social adjustment problems (The Mayo Clinic, 2016c).

*XXX Females*: Women with three X chromosomes (47XXX), referred to as Triple X syndrome, or trisomy X, experience normal development of sexual traits and are fertile. Affected individuals are usually taller than average and have slender builds and no severe phenotype, but may have a slight learning disorder (The Mayo Clinic, 2016b, U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2016). The frequency of women obtaining an extra X chromosome is approximately 1:1,000.

*Klinefelter Syndrome*: Klinefelter syndrome (47XXY or XY/XXY mosaic) is the most pervasive sex chromosomal anomaly (Klinefelter et al., 1942), affecting approximately 1 in 600 males (Nielsen and Wohlert, 1990). Males with Klinefelter syndrome carry two or more X chromosomes resulting in abnormal development of the testis, leading to hypogonadism and infertility (Bojesen et al., 2004). Affected males have incompletely developed secondary male sex characteristics, are often tall, have reductions in muscle mass, and produce relatively small amounts of T (The Mayo Clinic, 2016a).

*XYY Males*: Men inheriting an additional Y chromosome have higher than average levels of T and are usually taller than average and are prone to acne. Affected males are typically fertile, and many are unaware that they have a chromosomal abnormality. The frequency of males born with an additional Y chromosome is approximately 1:1,000.",2016-09-17 00:11:57+00:00,d7pzcun,1.0,t3_534t35,1720.0,atheism

Phyllis Schlafly is the person directly responsible for killing the Equal Rights Amendment with tropes such as ""men in women's bathrooms."" Basically her only argument was in the defense of traditional gender roles.

She stood for military escalation during the cold war, opposing any kind of arms control negotiations.

She was a xenophobe of the highest order, with comments like ""The people the Republicans should reach out to are the white votes, the white voters who didn’t vote in the last election. The propagandists are leading us down the wrong path,"" she said. ""There’s not any evidence at all that these Hispanics coming in from Mexico will vote Republican.""

Not to mention her opinions on the right to marriage equality with comments like ""The gay marriage goal is to wipe out the Christian religion."" By the way, her son is gay...which she thought was a direct attack on her.

Her rhetoric directly contributed to protestors harassing women outside of Planned Parenthood, and some would say she is even indirectly responsible for abortion clinic bombings. Her other opinions on feminism... well, how about I just copy and paste some quotes:

Schlafly told Time magazine in 1978, ""I have cancelled speeches whenever my husband thought that I had been away from home too much.""

In March 2007, Schlafly said in a speech at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, ""By getting married, the woman has consented to sex, and I don't think you can call it rape.""

In a March 30, 2006, interview, Schlafly attributed improvement in women's lives during the last decades of the 20th century to labor-saving devices such as the indoor clothes dryer and disposable diapers.

She called Roe v. Wade ""the worst decision in the history of the U.S. Supreme Court"" and said that it ""is responsible for the killing of millions of unborn babies"".

In 2007, while working to defeat a new version of the Equal Rights Amendment, she warned it would force courts to approve same-sex marriages and deny Social Security benefits for housewives and widows.

1881,"As best we can tell, gender identity is at least partially determined by brain structure formed very early in fetal development. A few studies show patterns typical of our identified gender and not of our birth sex.

Moreover, gender dysphoria correlates strongly with endocrine conditions - if we look at people born with externally female bodies, those with PCOS (which raises testosterone) are much more likely to ultimately identify as men; those with CAIS (which makes their bodies incapable of responding to testosterone) almost never do, to the point that single cases merit publication in their own right. On top of that, digit ratio (a marker of prenatal testosterone exposure) displays markedly low T exposure on average in trans women and high T exposure in trans men.

There's even some experimental evidence that, when cis (=not trans) people are categorized contrary to their birth sex, they experience the same distress that trans people do. Under the assumption that gender is malleable to social expectations, David Reimer was raised as a girl after a botched circumcision. He found himself uncomfortable with the female role, displayed symptoms typical of what would be expected of a trans man (that's FTM, to be clear), and ultimately transitioned to living as a man as soon as he became aware of his status in his early teens. And on the flip side, an author named Norah Vincent spent a year living as a man for the purposes of writing a book. By the end of that time, she was so depressed she checked herself into a mental institution because she was worried she might harm herself.

Additionally, trans feelings simply don't respond to psychiatric medication designed to 'cure' them. No professional organization in the world - even those that do classify us as a mental illness for (I feel) mostly historical/political reasons - recommends just giving us SSRIs or the like and sending us away. Traditional therapies simply do not work.

Compare this with Body Dysmorphic Disorder, a disorder that could be seen as an analog to trans people. BDD sufferers fixate on a small (e.g., a mole) or nonexistent part of their bodies, which they believe makes them hideous and unlovable. Some seek out treatment to remove the offending part. But BDD, unlike trans people, responds well to both therapy and SSRIs and does not respond to their desired interventions.",2016-09-02 16:12:48+00:00,d76wkce,5.0,t1_d76o7pn,12511.0,atheism

1887,"&gt; I hate myself for not realizing I was trans sooner

Join the club, I pushed it for as long as I could, which in my case was til I was 39. And that's more than twice yer age, young'un. The best time to come out is before puberty, the second best time to come out is right now. It's never to late!

&gt;I hate myself for being trans

If you play it right, it's a friggin blast!

&gt;I hate myself for bothering my cousins so much to talk to them when they're busy

So bother us, we'll always be here for you!

&gt;I hate myself for being shit at my job. I scrutinize every minor mistake I ever make.

Then get better. When you fuck up, take note of what went wrong, and dont repeat it. If you do, it's ok, try something else until you dont. 'twas always thus and always thus shall be.

&gt;my emotions whirlwind from being perfectly fine to sad to depression to anger to despair to desperately wishing I was dead

Now this, you have to take the time to catch your breath. That downward spiral is a bitch. Just take a deep breath, settle yourself, and then move on.

1942,"Historically, we were indeed considered mentally ill. The DSM (used in the US) recently declassified us as a 'disorder', but the ICD (used in much of the rest of the world) continues to classify us as a paraphilic disorder (essentially, a fetish). It's worth pointing out, however, that the ICD didn't declassify homosexuality as a disorder until the 90s (in fact, they did so in the current version of the ICD), two decades after the DSM declassified it. It also classifies the vast majority of the population as sex disordered, since things like enjoying kinky sex are disordered by the ICD's standards. The current draft of the upcoming new ICD edition also declassifies us as mentally ill, following the DSM's example.

But I would say we are not disordered, for three primary reasons: one, we show some basis in fact for our identification; two, unlike true delusional or somatoform disorders (which seem the most obvious comparison), psychiatric medication does not affect our feelings; and three, unlike true delusional/somatoform disorders, allowing us to pursue our feelings is far from destructive and in fact has exceptionally well-demonstrated positive results.

As best we can tell, gender identity is at least partially determined by brain structure formed very early in fetal development. A few studies show patterns typical of our identified gender and not of our birth sex.

Moreover, transgenderism correlates strongly with endocrine conditions - if we look at people born with externally female bodies, those with PCOS (which raises testosterone) are much more likely to ultimately identify as men; those with CAIS (which makes their bodies incapable of responding to testosterone) almost never do, to the point that single cases merit publication in their own right. On top of that, digit ratio (a marker of prenatal testosterone exposure) displays markedly low T exposure on average in trans women and high T exposure in trans men.

There's even some experimental evidence that, when cis (=not trans) people are categorized contrary to their birth sex, they experience the same distress that trans people do. Under the assumption that gender is malleable to social expectations, David Reimer was raised as a girl after a botched circumcision. He found himself uncomfortable with the female role, displayed symptoms typical of what would be expected of a trans man (that's FTM, to be clear), and ultimately transitioned to living as a man as soon as he became aware of his status in his early teens. And on the flip side, an author named Norah Vincent spent a year living as a man for the purposes of writing a book. By the end of that time, she was so depressed she checked herself into a mental institution because she was worried she might harm herself.

Additionally, trans feelings simply don't respond to psychiatric medication designed to 'cure' them. No professional organization in the world - even those that do classify us as a mental illness for (I feel) mostly historical/political reasons - recommends just giving us SSRIs or the like and sending us away. Traditional therapies simply do not work.

Compare this with Body Dysmorphic Disorder, a disorder that could be seen as an analog to trans people. BDD sufferers fixate on a small (e.g., a mole) or nonexistent part of their bodies, which they believe makes them hideous and unlovable. Some seek out treatment to remove the offending part. But BDD, unlike trans people, responds well to both therapy and SSRIs and does not respond to their desired interventions.",2016-08-28 23:49:31+00:00,d70k4qy,1.0,t3_4zytqb,49596.0,asktransgender

2056,"&gt;Your answer basically amounts to ""I know I'm trans because I know I'm trans,"" which is circular reasoning.

Well, when did you realize what gender you were?

&gt; Given that human beings are a sexually dimorphic species

Biology doesn’t work that way. Biological phenomena don’t necessarily fit into human-ordained binary categories. So while humans insist that you’re either male or female – that you have either XY or XX sex chromosomes – biology begs to differ.

Divergence from the normal number of X and Y chromosomes, called sex chromosome aneuploidy (SCA), accounts for approximately half of all chromosomal anomalies in humans, with a total frequency of 1:400 (Passarge, 1995). Aneuploidy occurs in at least 5% of all pregnancies, which is a relatively high frequency, and is the most commonly recognized chromosome abnormality in humans (Hassold and Hunt, 2001). Below are some examples:

*Turner Syndrome*: This disorder, also referred to as monosomy X (45X), occurs only in girls and women when the X chromosome is totally or partially missing. Although 45X is a frequent chromosomal anomaly, Turner syndrome is rare, with a live-birth frequency of 1:3,000 (Hook and Warburton, 1983). Affected individuals experience abnormal growth patterns, heart defects, and certain learning disabilities; they are short in stature; generally lack prominent female secondary sexual characteristics; and are sterile—features that in some individuals lead to social adjustment problems (The Mayo Clinic, 2016c).

*XXX Females*: Women with three X chromosomes (47XXX), referred to as Triple X syndrome, or trisomy X, experience normal development of sexual traits and are fertile. Affected individuals are usually taller than average and have slender builds and no severe phenotype, but may have a slight learning disorder (The Mayo Clinic, 2016b, U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2016). The frequency of women obtaining an extra X chromosome is approximately 1:1,000.

*Klinefelter Syndrome*: Klinefelter syndrome (47XXY or XY/XXY mosaic) is the most pervasive sex chromosomal anomaly (Klinefelter et al., 1942), affecting approximately 1 in 600 males (Nielsen and Wohlert, 1990). Males with Klinefelter syndrome carry two or more X chromosomes resulting in abnormal development of the testis, leading to hypogonadism and infertility (Bojesen et al., 2004). Affected males have incompletely developed secondary male sex characteristics, are often tall, have reductions in muscle mass, and produce relatively small amounts of T (The Mayo Clinic, 2016a).

*XYY Males*: Men inheriting an additional Y chromosome have higher than average levels of T and are usually taller than average and are prone to acne. Affected males are typically fertile, and many are unaware that they have a chromosomal abnormality. The frequency of males born with an additional Y chromosome is approximately 1:1,000.",2016-08-21 23:49:17+00:00,d6r7066,6.0,t1_d6r6umz,239.0,politics

2113,"&gt;Gender dysphoria is literally a delusion similar to ones found in eating disorders

gender dysphoria isnt the same as body dysmorphia.

Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), or body dysmorphia, is an anxiety disorder that causes sufferers to spend a lot of time worrying about their appearance and to have a distorted view of how they look.

Gender dysphoria is a condition where a person experiences discomfort or distress because there is a mismatch between their biological sex and gender identity...This mismatch between sex and gender identity can lead to distressing and uncomfortable feelings that are called gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is a recognised medical condition, for which treatment is sometimes appropriate. It is not a mental illness.

Those who suffer from body dysmorphia have a disconnection between the reality they are perceiving and how that perception is recognised in their brains. They look in an ordinary mirror, but for them, the result is something like we might imagine a funhouse mirror to look.

Body dysmorphia does not appear to have a specific medical treatment, although counseling and antidepressant medications are recommended. Surgery is NOT a treatment.

 It is substantially different in that one of the strongest aspects of gender dysphoria for many (but not all!) individuals who have those feelings is an acute awareness of what their physical features actually are and why those features do not match up with the gender presentation expected of the gender with which they identify.

And if acute awareness of physicality is an aspect of gender dysphoria which is precisely opposite of the defining aspect of body dysmorphia, it should follow that physical changes as the result of medical intervention would generally lead to solving feelings of dysphoria (unlike surgery for those with body dysmorphia which actually can cause more harm). And indeed, that has repeatedly been shown to be the case in [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12856892), after [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17075731), after [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19619147), after [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21699661), even with the potential for complications and need for future medical intervention post-operation for both trans women and trans men.

Traditional therapies simply do not work.

Compare this with Body Dysmorphic Disorder, a disorder that could be seen as an analog to trans people. BDD sufferers fixate on a small (e.g., a mole) or nonexistent part of their bodies, which they believe makes them hideous and unlovable. Some seek out treatment to remove the offending part.

2133,"&gt;  It means you're a deformed example of your gender.

I see somebody doesnt science. But I would say we are not disordered, for three primary reasons: one, we show some basis in fact for our identification; two, unlike true delusional or somatoform disorders (which seem the most obvious comparison), psychiatric medication does not affect our feelings; and three, unlike true delusional/somatoform disorders, allowing us to pursue our feelings is far from destructive and in fact has exceptionally well-demonstrated positive results.

As best we can tell, gender identity is at least partially determined by brain structure formed very early in fetal development. A few studies show patterns typical of our identified gender and not of our birth sex.

Moreover, transgenderism correlates strongly with endocrine conditions - if we look at people born with externally female bodies, those with PCOS (which raises testosterone) are much more likely to ultimately identify as men; those with CAIS (which makes their bodies incapable of responding to testosterone) almost never do, to the point that single cases merit publication in their own right. On top of that, digit ratio (a marker of prenatal testosterone exposure) displays markedly low T exposure on average in trans women and high T exposure in trans men.

There's even some experimental evidence that, when cis (=not trans) people are categorized contrary to their birth sex, they experience the same distress that trans people do. Under the assumption that gender is malleable to social expectations, David Reimer was raised as a girl after a botched circumcision. He found himself uncomfortable with the female role, displayed symptoms typical of what would be expected of a trans man (that's FTM, to be clear), and ultimately transitioned to living as a man as soon as he became aware of his status in his early teens. And on the flip side, an author named Norah Vincent spent a year living as a man for the purposes of writing a book. By the end of that time, she was so depressed she checked herself into a mental institution because she was worried she might harm herself.

Additionally, trans feelings simply don't respond to psychiatric medication designed to 'cure' them. No professional organization in the world - even those that do classify us as a mental illness for (I feel) mostly historical/political reasons - recommends just giving us SSRIs or the like and sending us away. Traditional therapies simply do not work.

2134,"Research proving that there is biological evidence for sexual orientation has been available since the 1980s. The links have been emphasized by new scientific research.

In 2014, researchers confirmed the association between same-sex orientation in men and a [specific chromosomal region](http://news.sciencemag.org/biology/2014/11/study-gay-brothers-may-confirm-x-chromosome-link-homosexuality). This is similar to findings originally published in the 1990s, which, at that time, gave rise to the idea that a “gay gene” must exist. But this argument has never been substantiated, despite the fact that studies have shown that homosexuality is a heritable trait.
Evidence points toward the existence of a complex interaction between genes and environment, which are responsible for the heritable nature of sexual orientation.

Although research has not yet found what the precise mechanisms are that determine sexual orientation—which may be heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual or asexual—the answers are likely to come to the fore through continued research. These findings will be important for the field of genetics and, more importantly, for those attracted to others of the same sex and society as a whole.

The first citation, “Tomeo, Templer, Anderson and Kotler” indicates a study that is presented as concluding there is a correlation between being abused as a child and being gay; the citation fails to note several highly relevant factors: primarily that it was a non-clinical study. The data concerning homosexuals was gathered by setting up an interview booth at a “Gay Pride” parade

Another interesting aspect of this study is the use of the word “molestation.” In the questionnaire given to participants, the word “molestation” is never used; “sexual contact” is used. What does this phrase mean to the various participants? Does it mean
one thing to those participating in a festive Gay Pride Parade and something quite different to a student at a perhaps more subdued or introspective University setting?

Since 84% of gay men and 95% of women considered themselves gay before the “sexual contact” according to the study, could it be something less nefarious than, for example, forcible rape they were recounting? 

Instead of continuing to use the phrase “sexual contact” in their closing discussions, the authors of the study switch to “molestation” in their analysis of the data.

Divergence from the normal number of X and Y chromosomes, called sex chromosome aneuploidy (SCA), accounts for approximately half of all chromosomal anomalies in humans, with a total frequency of 1:400 (Passarge, 1995). Aneuploidy occurs in at least 5% of all pregnancies, which is a relatively high frequency, and is the most commonly recognized chromosome abnormality in humans (Hassold and Hunt, 2001). Below are some examples:

Although 45X is a frequent chromosomal anomaly, Turner syndrome is rare, with a live-birth frequency of 1:3,000 (Hook and Warburton, 1983). Affected individuals experience abnormal growth patterns, heart defects, and certain learning disabilities; they are short in stature; generally lack prominent female secondary sexual characteristics; and are sterile—features that in some individuals lead to social adjustment problems (The Mayo Clinic, 2016c).

*XXX Females*: Women with three X chromosomes (47XXX), referred to as Triple X syndrome, or trisomy X, experience normal development of sexual traits and are fertile. Affected individuals are usually taller than average and have slender builds and no severe phenotype, but may have a slight learning disorder (The Mayo Clinic, 2016b, U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2016). The frequency of women obtaining an extra X chromosome is approximately 1:1,000.

*Klinefelter Syndrome*: Klinefelter syndrome (47XXY or XY/XXY mosaic) is the most pervasive sex chromosomal anomaly (Klinefelter et al., 1942), affecting approximately 1 in 600 males (Nielsen and Wohlert, 1990). Males with Klinefelter syndrome carry two or more X chromosomes resulting in abnormal development of the testis, leading to hypogonadism and infertility (Bojesen et al., 2004). Affected males have incompletely developed secondary male sex characteristics, are often tall, have reductions in muscle mass, and produce relatively small amounts of T (The Mayo Clinic, 2016a).

*XYY Males*: Men inheriting an additional Y chromosome have higher than average levels of T and are usually taller than average and are prone to acne. Affected males are typically fertile, and many are unaware that they have a chromosomal abnormality. The frequency of males born with an additional Y chromosome is approximately 1:1,000.",2016-08-20 01:11:16+00:00,d6oudyz,2.0,t1_d6ouagz,156.0,politics
2139,"Science says that both sex and gender lie on a spectrum, not a binary. People tend to define sex in a binary way — either wholly male or wholly female — based on physical appearance or by which sex chromosomes an individual carries. But while sex and gender may seem dichotomous, there are in reality many intermediates.

 Understanding this complexity is critical; misperceptions can affect the health and civil liberties of those who fall outside perceived societal norms. Society has categorical views on what should define sex and gender, but the biological reality is just not there to support that.

Even at the most basic physical level, there is a spectrum between male and female that often goes unrecognized and risks being obscured by stigma. 

A growing body of research is showing how biology influences gender expression, sexual orientation and gender identity — characteristics that can also fall outside of strict, socially defined categories. Toy-preference tests, a popular gauge of gender expression, have long shown that boys and girls will typically gravitate to toys that are stereotypically associated with their gender (cars and guns for boys, for instance, or plush toys for girls). While one might argue that this could be the by-product of a child’s environment — parental influence at play or an internalization of societal norms — Melissa Hines, a former UCLA researcher and current professor of psychology at the University of Cambridge, in England, has shown otherwise. In 2008, she demonstrated that monkeys showed the same sex-based toy preferences as humans — absent societal influence.

Sexual orientation (whether one tends to be attracted to men or women) has also been shown to have biological roots. Twin studies and genetic linkage studies have shown both hereditary patterns in homosexuality (attraction to one’s own sex), as well as genetic associations with specific parts of the genome. And while gender identity — the sense one has of oneself as being either male or female — has been harder to pinpoint from a biological standpoint, efforts to understand what role biology may play are ongoing.",2016-08-20 01:10:04+00:00,d6oucc2,4.0,t1_d6otjz3,1244.0,politics

You allow them to socially transition and live as their true gender.  The Endocrine Society has protocols in place for minors who exhibit gender dysphoria, they do not recommend starting hormone replacement therapy for minors under 16. 

The American Psychiatric Association, publisher of the DSM-5, states that ""gender nonconformity is not in itself a mental disorder. The critical element of gender dysphoria is the presence of clinically significant distress associated with the condition.""

Let's see what Science has to say about it.

[When Transgender Kids Transition, Medical Risks are Both Known and Unknown](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/when-transgender-kids-transition-medical-risks-are-both-known-and-unknown/)

Furthermore, [a study with 32 transgender children, ages 5 to 12, indicates that the gender identity of these children is deeply held and is not the result of confusion about gender identity or pretense. ](http://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-01-transgender-kids-gender-identity.html) The study is one of the first to explore gender identity in transgender children using implicit measures that operate outside conscious awareness and are, therefore, less susceptible to modification than self-report measures.

[Pausing Puberty with Hormone Blockers May Help Transgender Kids](http://www.livescience.com/50755-transgender-kids-hormone-blocker-puberty.html)

[ Socially transitioned transgender children who are supported in their gender identity have developmentally normative levels of depression and only minimal elevations in anxiety, suggesting that psychopathology is not inevitable within this group. Especially striking is the comparison with reports of children with GID; socially transitioned transgender children have notably lower rates of internalizing psychopathology than previously reported among children with GID living as their natal sex.](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2016/02/24/peds.2015-3223)

2220,"Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), or body dysmorphia, is an anxiety disorder that causes sufferers to spend a lot of time worrying about their appearance and to have a distorted view of how they look.

Gender dysphoria is a condition where a person experiences discomfort or distress because there is a mismatch between their biological sex and gender identity...This mismatch between sex and gender identity can lead to distressing and uncomfortable feelings that are called gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is a recognised medical condition, for which treatment is sometimes appropriate. It is not a mental illness.

Those who suffer from body dysmorphia have a disconnection between the reality they are perceiving and how that perception is recognised in their brains. They look in an ordinary mirror, but for them, the result is something like we might imagine a funhouse mirror to look.

Body dysmorphia does not appear to have a specific medical treatment, although counseling and antidepressant medications are recommended. Surgery is NOT a treatment.

 It is substantially different in that one of the strongest aspects of gender dysphoria for many (but not all!) individuals who have those feelings is an acute awareness of what their physical features actually are and why those features do not match up with the gender presentation expected of the gender with which they identify.

And if acute awareness of physicality is an aspect of gender dysphoria which is precisely opposite of the defining aspect of body dysmorphia, it should follow that physical changes as the result of medical intervention would generally lead to solving feelings of dysphoria (unlike surgery for those with body dysmorphia which actually can cause more harm). And indeed, that has repeatedly been shown to be the case in [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12856892), after [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17075731), after [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19619147), after [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21699661), even with the potential for complications and need for future medical intervention post-operation for both trans women and trans men.

2250,"Do you even science? Biology doesn’t work that way. Biological phenomena don’t necessarily fit into human-ordained binary categories. So while humans insist that you’re either male or female – that you have either XY or XX sex chromosomes – biology begs to differ.

Divergence from the normal number of X and Y chromosomes, called sex chromosome aneuploidy (SCA), accounts for approximately half of all chromosomal anomalies in humans, with a total frequency of 1:400 (Passarge, 1995). Aneuploidy occurs in at least 5% of all pregnancies, which is a relatively high frequency, and is the most commonly recognized chromosome abnormality in humans (Hassold and Hunt, 2001). Below are some examples:

*Turner Syndrome*: This disorder, also referred to as monosomy X (45X), occurs only in girls and women when the X chromosome is totally or partially missing. Although 45X is a frequent chromosomal anomaly, Turner syndrome is rare, with a live-birth frequency of 1:3,000 (Hook and Warburton, 1983). Affected individuals experience abnormal growth patterns, heart defects, and certain learning disabilities; they are short in stature; generally lack prominent female secondary sexual characteristics; and are sterile—features that in some individuals lead to social adjustment problems (The Mayo Clinic, 2016c).

*XXX Females*: Women with three X chromosomes (47XXX), referred to as Triple X syndrome, or trisomy X, experience normal development of sexual traits and are fertile. Affected individuals are usually taller than average and have slender builds and no severe phenotype, but may have a slight learning disorder (The Mayo Clinic, 2016b, U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2016). The frequency of women obtaining an extra X chromosome is approximately 1:1,000.

*Klinefelter Syndrome*: Klinefelter syndrome (47XXY or XY/XXY mosaic) is the most pervasive sex chromosomal anomaly (Klinefelter et al., 1942), affecting approximately 1 in 600 males (Nielsen and Wohlert, 1990). Males with Klinefelter syndrome carry two or more X chromosomes resulting in abnormal development of the testis, leading to hypogonadism and infertility (Bojesen et al., 2004). Affected males have incompletely developed secondary male sex characteristics, are often tall, have reductions in muscle mass, and produce relatively small amounts of T (The Mayo Clinic, 2016a).

*XYY Males*: Men inheriting an additional Y chromosome have higher than average levels of T and are usually taller than average and are prone to acne. Affected males are typically fertile, and many are unaware that they have a chromosomal abnormality. The frequency of males born with an additional Y chromosome is approximately 1:1,000.",2016-08-13 21:00:47+00:00,d6gae3z,4.0,t1_d6g30f2,11750.0,TwoXChromosomes

First off, let's make one thing clear, it is not a ""trend"", it is how we experience gender, and it is different for everyone, it doesnt exist on a binary. Some of us exist at definite points on the gender spectrum, exclusively male, or exclusively female. There are some of us who are transgender, but also exclusively male or female, that is, we transition from male to high femme female, or vice versa, from female to manly man. There there are those of us who exist in the middle, neither male nor female. I myself am high femme in presentation, but mentally? I am somewhere inbetweeny male and female. Then there are those of us for who gender is a nebulous thing, we are sometimes male, and sometimes female. All of these are valid identities.

Now as for kids, there are more and more who have the freedom to explore their gender. Not all of them will be transgender, but there is no harm in letting them socially transition, or even for them to go on hormone blockers to delay puberty while they sort things out. 

Being trans or genderqueer is not some ""fashion"" it is a sincere expression of how we perceive our gender, and it is unique to everyone. The gender binary now exists as a relic of the past, there is no going back. The children of today will see to that.

&gt;Made up pronouns are dumb.

Some people are not comfortable with binary pronouns, they prefer gender neutral pronouns. Nothing wrong with acknowledging that.

&gt;You can't call yourself a biological woman if you have a penis.

Biology doesn’t work that way. Biological phenomena don’t necessarily fit into human-ordained binary categories. So while humans insist that you’re either male or female – that you have either XY or XX sex chromosomes – biology begs to differ.

For example, genetic men with Klinefelter syndrome possess an extra X chromosome (XXY) or more rarely, two or three extra Xs (XXXY, XXXXY); they typically produce low levels of testosterone, leading to less-developed masculine sexual characteristics and more-developed feminine characteristics than other men. In contrast, some men receive an extra Y chromosome (XYY) in the genetic lottery, and while they have been referred to as “supermales” that is more sensationalism than science.

Genetic women with Turner syndrome have only one X chromosome; they often display less-developed female sexual characteristics than other women. And people with a genetic mosaic possess XX chromosomes in some cells and XY in others. So how do we determine if they’re male or female? Hint: Don’t say that it depends on the chromosomal makeup of the majority of their cells, since women with more than 90 per cent XY genetic material have given birth.

Even if you get the “right” combination of sex chromosomes, it’s no guarantee that you’ll fit into the carefully circumscribed human definitions of male and female.

For example, genetic women (XX) with congenital adrenal hyperplasia produced unusually high levels of virilizing hormones in utero and develop stereotypically masculine sexual characteristics, including masculinized genitals.

Similarly, genetic men (XY) with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome don’t respond to male hormones and fail to develop masculine sexual characteristics. Most live their lives as women. Some historians suggest that Joan of Arc, Elizabeth I and Wallis Simpson all suffered from this syndrome.

So what’s the answer? There isn’t one, at least if we’re looking for the answer in biology. We must not fall back on biology. Rather, we must always remember that it is we, not biology, who decide who counts as male or female. And it is we who must take responsibility for our decisions.",2016-08-06 18:43:20+00:00,d66xbsv,10.0,t1_d66j13q,32040.0,asktransgender

2326,"&gt; wearing a dress, changing your name, and displaying the trappings of the opposite sex because it makes you feel better.

I find it interesting that the example you use involves trans women. Trans men also exist. Gender dysphoria is not a psychoses. And it's not simply a matter of ""putting on a dress"" as you put it. 

Psychosis is characterized by an impaired relationship with reality. And it is a symptom of serious mental disorders. People who are psychotic may have either hallucinations or delusions.

Gender dysphoria is the incongruity between what the brain expects the body to be versus how the body is actually configured.

Unlike true delusional or somatoform disorders (which seem the most obvious comparison), psychiatric medication does not affect our feelings. Trans feelings simply don't respond to psychiatric medication designed to 'cure' them. No professional organization in the world  recommends just giving us SSRIs or the like and sending us away. Traditional therapies simply do not work.

Moreover, transgenderism correlates strongly with endocrine conditions - if we look at people born with externally female bodies, those with PCOS (which raises testosterone) are much more likely to ultimately identify as men; those with CAIS (which makes their bodies incapable of responding to testosterone) almost never do, to the point that single cases merit publication in their own right. On top of that, digit ratio (a marker of prenatal testosterone exposure) displays markedly low T exposure on average in trans women and high T exposure in trans men.

There's even some experimental evidence that, when cis (=not trans) people are categorized contrary to their birth sex, they experience the same distress that trans people do. Under the assumption that gender is malleable to social expectations, David Reimer was raised as a girl after a botched circumcision. He found himself uncomfortable with the female role, displayed symptoms typical of what would be expected of a trans man (that's FTM, to be clear), and ultimately transitioned to living as a man as soon as he became aware of his status in his early teens. And on the flip side, an author named Norah Vincent spent a year living as a man for the purposes of writing a book. By the end of that time, she was so depressed she checked herself into a mental institution because she was worried she might harm herself.",2016-08-05 19:09:01+00:00,d65qxpw,4.0,t1_d65n556,4808.0,science
2327,"Not all of us go for surgery, and gender dysphoria is more than just the sum of our surgeries. It's about the sense of self, and that exists despite the gender we were assigned at birth.

2328,"The American Psychiatric Association, publisher of the DSM-5, states that ""gender nonconformity is not in itself a mental disorder. The critical element of gender dysphoria is the presence of clinically significant distress associated with the condition.""

And then there are those in the middle of the bell curve who are pan or bisexual. 

Now as for trans people, when they transition, they sometimes end up finding out that they are not attracted to the gender of the people they dated before hand. It's not uncommon in our community.

That just means that they've allowed themselves to explore their own sexuality. Now may that change somewhere else down the line? Sure. But you cannot influence that by ending someone to  conversion therapy. It has to come from that person him or herself.

* [Colizzi et al., 2013](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12155/abstract): ""At enrollment, transsexuals reported elevated CAR ['cortisol awakening response', a physiological measure of stress]; their values were out of normal.

When treated with hormone therapy [at followup, 1 year after beginning HRT], transsexuals reported significantly lower CAR (P &lt; 0.001), falling within the normal range for cortisol levels. Treated transsexuals showed also lower perceived stress (P &lt; 0.001), with levels similar to normative samples.""

Apparently not if you're bringing it up in a comment reply trying to make a point about gender dysphoria.

&gt;Maybe they are just a transvestite and also suffer from extreme anxiety or depression. 

That would make the child gender diverse, and they will hopefully go and live a wonderful gender creative cis life. Mazel tov.

&gt;If a young child says they are trans it is definitely going to be a long conversation

And they are monitored by a doctor to ensure that the signs of gender dysphoria are persistent, insistent, and consistent. They dont just put you on blockers right away.

&gt;and interfering with their puberty (which often triggers them back into CIS gender)

Again, a factually untrue medical statement with no basis in science or reality.

&gt;could actually do much more harm than good

Studies have shown that allowing a child to explore their gender only helps them, not hurts.

**American Psychiatric Association**  
Position Statement on Access to Care for Transgender and Gender Variant Individuals (2012)  
 The American Psychiatric Association:  
1. Recognizes that appropriately evaluated transgender and gender variant individuals can benefit greatly from medical and surgical gender transition treatments.  
2. Advocates for removal of barriers to care and supports both public and private health insurance coverage for gender transition treatment.  
3. Opposes categorical exclusions of coverage for such medically necessary treatment when prescribed by a physician.

Position Statement on Discrimination Against Transgender and Gender Variant Individuals
(2012)  
 Being transgender gender or variant implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities; however, these individuals often experience discrimination due to a lack of civil rights protections for their gender identity or expression… Thus, this position statement is relevant to the APA because discrimination and lack of equal civil rights is damaging to the mental health of  transgender and gender variant individuals.  

**The American Psychiatric Association:**  
1. Supports laws that protect the civil rights of transgender and gender variant individuals.  
2. Urges the repeal of laws and policies that discriminate against transgender and gender variant individuals.  
3. Opposes all public and private discrimination against transgender and gender variant individuals in such areas as health care, employment, housing, public accommodation, education, and licensing.  
4. Declares that no burden of proof of such judgment, capacity, or reliability shall be placed upon these individuals greater than that imposed on any other persons.

American Psychological Association
Policy on Transgender, Gender Identity &amp; Gender Expression Non-Discrimination (2008)
As stated in the Policy on Transgender, Gender Identity &amp; Gender Expression NonDiscrimination,
the APA “opposes all public and private discrimination on the basis of actual or perceived gender identity and expression and urges the repeal of discriminatory laws and policies” and “calls upon psychologists in their professional roles to provide appropriate, nondiscriminatory treatment to transgender and gender variant individuals and encourages psychologists to take a leadership role in working against discrimination towards transgender and gender variant individuals.” 

The “APA recognizes the efficacy, benefit and medical necessity of gender transition treatments for appropriately evaluated individuals and calls upon public and private insurers to cover these medically necessary treatments.”

**American Academy of Family Physicians**  
Resolution No. 1004 (2012)
In 2007, an AAFP Commission declared that the association has a policy opposing any
form of patient discrimination and stated its opposition to the exclusion of transgender
health care. In 2012, the organization released a new resolution: “RESOLVED, That the
American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) support efforts to require insurers to
provide coverage for comprehensive care of [transgender] individuals including medical
care, screening tests based on medical need rather than gender, mental health care, and,
when medically necessary, gender reassignment surgery.”

**World Professional Association for Transgender Health**  
Clarification on Medical Necessity of Treatment, Sex Reassignment, and Insurance Coverage in the U.S.A. (2008)  
WPATH found that decades of experience with the Standards of Care show gender transitions and related care to be accepted, good medical practice and effective treatment.  
In a 2008 clarification, WPATH stated:

[S]ex reassignment, properly indicated and performed as provided by the Standards of Care, has proven to be beneficial and effective in the treatment of individuals with transsexualism, gender identity disorder, and/or gender dysphoria. Sex reassignment plays an undisputed role in contributing toward favorable outcomes, and comprises Real Life Experience, legal name and sex change on identity documents, as well as medically necessary hormone treatment, counseling, psychotherapy, and other medical procedures...


The medical procedures attendant to sex reassignment are not ‘cosmetic’ or ‘elective’ or for the mere convenience of the patient. These reconstructive procedures are not optional in any meaningful sense, but are understood to be medically necessary for the treatment of the diagnosed condition.

From the APA:-

&gt; Lesbian, gay and bisexual orientations are not disorders. Research has found no inherent association between any of these sexual orientations and psychopathology. Both heterosexual behavior and homosexual behavior are normal aspects of human sexuality. Both have been documented in many different cultures and historical eras. Despite the persistence of stereotypes that portray lesbian, gay and bisexual people as disturbed, several decades of research and clinical experience have led all mainstream medical and mental health organizations in this country to conclude that these orientations represent normal forms of human experience. Lesbian, gay and bisexual relationships are normal forms of human bonding.

2412,"&gt; Yes there is data that supports the medications.

[citation needed]

&gt;Plenty of transsexuals still have identity issues and depression after their surgical procedures and hormonal therapies. 

That are unrelated to their gender dysphoria.

&gt;I'm on my phone right now and can get some pub med articles on it later.

I'd LOVE to see them, because i have several studies that say otherwise.

&gt;I sat in on a rhinoplasty that was done on a girl with body dismorphic disorder.

Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), or body dysmorphia, is an anxiety disorder that causes sufferers to spend a lot of time worrying about their appearance and to have a distorted view of how they look.

Gender dysphoria is a condition where a person experiences discomfort or distress because there is a mismatch between their biological sex and gender identity...This mismatch between sex and gender identity can lead to distressing and uncomfortable feelings that are called gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is a recognised medical condition, for which treatment is sometimes appropriate. A medical professional would know the difference.

Those who suffer from body dysmorphia have a disconnection between the reality they are perceiving and how that perception is recognised in their brains. They look in an ordinary mirror, but for them, the result is something like we might imagine a funhouse mirror to look.

Body dysmorphia does not appear to have a specific medical treatment, although counseling and antidepressant medications are recommended. Surgery is NOT a treatment.

 It is substantially different in that one of the strongest aspects of gender dysphoria for many (but not all!) individuals who have those feelings is an acute awareness of what their physical features actually are and why those features do not match up with the gender presentation expected of the gender with which they identify.

And if acute awareness of physicality is an aspect of gender dysphoria which is precisely opposite of the defining aspect of body dysmorphia, it should follow that physical changes as the result of medical intervention would generally lead to solving feelings of dysphoria (unlike surgery for those with body dysmorphia which actually can cause more harm). And indeed, that has repeatedly been shown to be the case in [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12856892), after [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17075731), after [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19619147), after [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21699661), even with the potential for complications and need for future medical intervention post-operation for both trans women and trans men.

&gt;I simply expressed an opinion 

No, you stated an uninformed or willfully ignorant claim bereft of any evidence to back it up. ",2016-08-03 19:39:29+00:00,d62wjyw,6.0,t1_d62v8zz,1590.0,atheism
2413,"The 84 percent desistance figure is meaningless because when Dr. Steensma [went back in 2013](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23702447) and looked at the intensity of dysphoria these children felt as a factor in persistence, it turned out that it was actually a very good predictor of which children would transition.

In other words, the children who actually met the clinical guidelines for gender dysphoria as children generally ended up as transgender adults. Further research has shown that children who meet the clinical guidelines for gender dysphoria are as consistent in their gender identity as the general population.

&gt;Most trans people today self diagnose, and get their HRT off the street. 

That's just not true, self-medding is usually when the trans person cannot access legal HRT. 

&gt;There is much scientific literature to suggest that the overwhelming majority of them have some other underlying condition that they are misinterpreting as being trans

Again, that is simply not true at all. All the medical literature suggests that trans people are trans.

&gt;That is likely one of several reasons why the suicide rate among trans individuals is so high, most of them are avoiding care, and many are likely suffering from other conditions which make them prone to suicidal thoughts.

There is absolutely no scientific basis to any of these claims.

It was found that suicide attempts [were less common among transgender people who said their family ties had remained strong](http://articles.latimes.com/2014/jan/28/local/la-me-ln-suicide-attempts-alarming-transgender-20140127) after they came out.

Nope, gender variant children should be encourage to explore their gender to their fullest AND be supported. [It is far better for their mental health.](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2016/02/24/peds.2015-3223) 

&gt;Giving them HRT implies that their body is wrong and they need to fix it.

Again, hormone blockers are not hormone replacement therapy. The blockers are administered so that the child can take the time to figure out their gender. It is far more damaging for a trans child to go through the puberty of the gender they were assigned at birth

&gt;puts that child at a nearly 80% chance of committing suicide (it only goes down to about 60% in an accepting community).

The suicide rate is not due to the gender dysphoria, it arises from the treatment of that child in their community.

&gt;The very few doctors who are touting HRT are using it way off label and are nothing other than snake oil salesmen pandering to scared young families and trying to make a few bucks.

HRT is not ""off label"", it is the recommended treatment laid out by the Endocrine Society. And even then, they recommend only starting hrt after the individual has turned 16. 

&gt;There is no science to back up the use of HRT until much later in life

Wrong again.

National health organizations in the United States have announced that there has been no scientific demonstration of conversion therapy's efficacy in the last forty years. They find that conversion therapy is ineffective, risky and can be harmful. Anecdotal claims of cures are counterbalanced by assertions of harm, and the American Psychiatric Association, for example, cautions ethical practitioners under the Hippocratic oath to do no harm to refrain from attempts at conversion therapy.

Mainstream medical bodies state that conversion therapy can be harmful because it may exploit guilt and anxiety, thereby damaging self-esteem and leading to depression and even suicide. There is also concern in the mental health community that the advancement of conversion therapy can cause social harm by disseminating inaccurate views about sexual orientation and the ability of gay and bisexual people to lead happy, healthy lives.

Mainstream health organizations critical of conversion therapy include the American Medical Association, American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association, the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy, the American Counseling Association, the National Association of Social Workers, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Association of School Psychologists, and the American Academy of Physician Assistants.

The American Psychological Association undertook a study of the peer-reviewed literature in the area of sexual orientation change efforts (SOCE) and found a myriad of issues with the procedures used in conducting the research. The taskforce did find that that some participants experienced a lessening of same sex attraction and arousal, but that these instances were ""rare"" and ""uncommon."" The taskforce concluded that, ""given the limited amount of methodically sound research, claims that recent SOCE is effective are not supported. Two issues with SOCE claims are that conversion therapists falsely assume that homosexuality is a mental disorder and that their research focuses almost exclusively on gay men and rarely includes lesbians.

2693,"The earliest scientific studies of transgender issues began by asking the most fundamental questions:
how many people are transgender, and what is the ratio of transgender women (male to female) to
transgender men (female to male)? 

These studies are almost exclusively concerned with quantifying
the number of people who request or undergo SRS. Benjamin (1967), drawing on records from his
own practice, indicated that for every 8 male to female patients, he had one female to male patient,
and this basic relationship persists in subsequent studies. Using information on applications for SRS
in the late 1960s, Pauly (1968) estimated that 2,000 transgender women and 500 transgender men
were living in the United States (for a ratio of 4:1). The vast majority of these kinds of studies,
however, are based on European data. W˚alinder (1968) conducted a census of all psychiatric
practices in Sweden and found 1 in 54,000 individuals asked for or received SRS, and a much
lower ratio of 2.5:1 transgender women to men.

2864,"Gender dysphoria isnt the same as body dysmorphia.

Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), or body dysmorphia, is an anxiety disorder that causes sufferers to spend a lot of time worrying about their appearance and to have a distorted view of how they look.

Gender dysphoria is a condition where a person experiences discomfort or distress because there is a mismatch between their biological sex and gender identity...This mismatch between sex and gender identity can lead to distressing and uncomfortable feelings that are called gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is a recognised medical condition, for which treatment is sometimes appropriate. It is not a mental illness.

Those who suffer from body dysmorphia have a disconnection between the reality they are perceiving and how that perception is recognised in their brains. They look in an ordinary mirror, but for them, the result is something like we might imagine a funhouse mirror to look.

Body dysmorphia does not appear to have a specific medical treatment, although counseling and antidepressant medications are recommended. Surgery is NOT a treatment.

 It is substantially different in that one of the strongest aspects of gender dysphoria for many (but not all!) individuals who have those feelings is an acute awareness of what their physical features actually are and why those features do not match up with the gender presentation expected of the gender with which they identify.

And if acute awareness of physicality is an aspect of gender dysphoria which is precisely opposite of the defining aspect of body dysmorphia, it should follow that physical changes as the result of medical intervention would generally lead to solving feelings of dysphoria (unlike surgery for those with body dysmorphia which actually can cause more harm). And indeed, that has repeatedly been shown to be the case in [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12856892), after [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17075731), after [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19619147), after [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21699661), even with the potential for complications and need for future medical intervention post-operation for both trans women and trans men.

[Decrease in Eggshell Weight in Certain Birds of Prey](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v215/n5097/abs/215208a0.html)

Ratcliffe claimed that the incidence of broken eggs in nests of peregrine falcons, sparrowhawks, and golden eagles had increased considerably since 1950. He compared eggshells collected before 1946 with eggshells collected afterward, and found that post-1946 peregrine falcon eggshells weighed 19 percent less; sparrowhawks' weighed 24 percent less; and golden eagles' 8 percent less.

""For the species examined, frequency of egg-breakage, scale of decrease in eggshell weight, subsequent status of breeding population, and exposure to persistent organic pesticides are correlated""

[Chlorinated Hydrocarbons and Eggshell Changes in Raptorial and Fish-Eating Birds](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/162/3850/271)

 ""Catastrophic declines of three raptorial species in the United States have been accompanied by decreases in eggshell thickness that began in 1947, and have amounted to 19 percent or more, and were identical to phenomena found in Britain.""

The three species were peregrine falcons, bald eagles, and ospreys. They claimed that the eggshell thinning coincided with the introduction of chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides like DDT, and concluded that these compounds were harming certain species of birds at the tops of contaminated ecosystems.

[DDE-induced Eggshell Thinning in the American kestrel: A Comparison of the Field Situation and Laboratory Results.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2402090)

Captive kestrels were fed a DDE(a DDT metabolite)-laced diet and their eggs were then compared with those taken from the nests of wild kestrels. The study found that dietary levels of three, six, and 10 parts per million (ppm) of DDE resulted in eggshells that were 14 percent, 17.4 percent, and 21.7 percent thinner respectively. 

""Despite the recent controversy, there can be little doubt now as to the causal relationship between the global contaminant DDE and the observed eggshell thinning and the consequent population declines in several birds of prey,""

This sets it apart from many other disorders in the DSM, because if someone is depressed, for example, he or she is, almost by definition, distressed as part of depression. In contrast, the distress that accompanies gender dysphoria arises as a result of a culture that stigmatizes people who do not conform to gender norms.

There's a disconnect between our mind and body. You cannot change the mind (unlike body dysmorpia), so we (sometimes) have to change the body.

Yes you are. 

http://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/transgender.aspx

(spoiler alert, it's not a mental illness)

According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), disorders are thought of as “a clinically significant behavior, psychologically syndrome, or a pattern that occurs in an individual typically associated with distress, painful symptomology, disability or impairment.” 

Dysphoria, on the other hand, is a “psychological state that causes one to experience feelings of anxiety, restlessness and depression. It is not necessarily diagnosable, or something that would be identified in the DSM, but it is more a state of being, a feeling or unpleasantness or discomfort.”       

The previous diagnosis of GID implied that the problem lie within the client, further suggesting that the client needed to be cured or somehow mentally and emotionally fixed. The pending reclassification speaks to the mental state that accompanies being transgendered within this society. 

Rather than indicating that a person needs to be fixed, the diagnosis indicates that the issues that need to be addressed lie outside the individual. Kelly Winters, from the group GID Reform Advocates, believes that the change in diagnosis signifies that “the problem to be treated is not the person’s identity, but rather the distress that is often experienced by those who need access to medical transition care.”      

Although transgender individuals are still dependent upon these institutions, the removal of GID is compared to the organization’s declassification of homosexuality as a mental disorder in 1973. ",2016-07-11 18:24:42+00:00,d5863yj,21.0,t1_d584n99,1907.0,politics

3084,"Gender dysphoria isnt the same as body dysmorphia.

Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), or body dysmorphia, is an anxiety disorder that causes sufferers to spend a lot of time worrying about their appearance and to have a distorted view of how they look.

Gender dysphoria is a condition where a person experiences discomfort or distress because there is a mismatch between their biological sex and gender identity...This mismatch between sex and gender identity can lead to distressing and uncomfortable feelings that are called gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is a recognised medical condition, for which treatment is sometimes appropriate. It is not a mental illness.

Those who suffer from body dysmorphia have a disconnection between the reality they are perceiving and how that perception is recognised in their brains. They look in an ordinary mirror, but for them, the result is something like we might imagine a funhouse mirror to look.

Body dysmorphia does not appear to have a specific medical treatment, although counseling and antidepressant medications are recommended. Surgery is NOT a treatment.

 It is substantially different in that one of the strongest aspects of gender dysphoria for many (but not all!) individuals who have those feelings is an acute awareness of what their physical features actually are and why those features do not match up with the gender presentation expected of the gender with which they identify.

And if acute awareness of physicality is an aspect of gender dysphoria which is precisely opposite of the defining aspect of body dysmorphia, it should follow that physical changes as the result of medical intervention would generally lead to solving feelings of dysphoria (unlike surgery for those with body dysmorphia which actually can cause more harm). And indeed, that has repeatedly been shown to be the case in [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12856892), after [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17075731), after [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19619147), after [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21699661), even with the potential for complications and need for future medical intervention post-operation for both trans women and trans men.",2016-07-10 20:07:58+00:00,d570boz,8.0,t1_d56xl6e,4193.0,politics

&gt;Is being transgender a mental disorder?

&gt;A psychological state is considered a mental disorder only if it causes significant distress or disability. Many transgender people do not experience their gender as distressing or disabling, which implies that identifying as transgender does not constitute a mental disorder.

If you think that the genitals alone make up a person's gender, then I'm afraid you're sadly mistaken. A large proportion of trans trans are non-op. It's the hormones and the gender gender presentation we adopt that alleviate the gender dysphoria. Yes, for some the dysphoria persists until gential reassignment surgery is undertaken, but it is far from ""mutilation"" as you so eloquently put it.

No, I am not. 

&gt;Blanchard defined autogynephilia as ""a males propensity to be sexually aroused as the thought of himself as a women""

See, you said it yourself, the term DID NOT EXIST before Blanchard. He invented it. He came up with it. Ripped from the ether. Conjured out of thin air. Without Blanchard, AGP would be what it always was, a kink, just like any other kink. By Blanchard's definition, a woman cannot have AGP. So, absent the term of AGP, a woman would just be incredibly turned on by imagining herself as one sexy example of womanhood, something women have been doing since the dawn of time. Instead, we now have a definition of transvestic fetishism. (Thanks Ray, way to do the trans community a solid.) 

If Ray Blanchard had not been put on this earth, the term AGP would not haunt us now. There would be trans people, and there would be people who turn themselves on by think that they are one sexy bitch. And all would be well with the world. 

Instead, now we get into rambling conversations about theory vs definition.

Rather than asking the scientifically neutral question, “What does it mean to be transgender?” Blanchard asks, ""What kind of defect in a male's capacity for sexual learning could produce autogynephilic  transvestitism?""  
 
A balanced portrait of Blanchard’s key empirical findings would reveal that they: 

(1) have never been replicated

(2) failed to include control groups of typically-gendered women

(3) drew conclusions about causality from entirely observational data. 

(4) failed to covary the acknowledged age-differences from ANOVA (Analysis of variance, ANOVA is a collection of statistical models used to analyze the differences among group means and their associated procedures such as ""variation"" among and between groups, developed by statistician and evolutionary biologist Ronald Fisher.)

Pelosi’s congressional delegations do eat well and drink pricey alcohol. But the costs are not as high as critics claim, and they’re comparable to those of her Republican predecessor, Dennis Hastert.

 Judicial Watch overstated the amount of money spent on “in-flight expenses” for Pelosi’s congressional delegations, or CODELs. Furthermore, Judicial Watch, a watchdog group that describes itself as ""conservative,"" failed to compare Pelosi’s costs with those of the previous speaker, Republican Dennis Hastert, even though the Air Force handed over documents covering CODELs that he led, as well as those led by Pelosi. And the fact is that Hastert’s travel, as represented in Judicial Watch’s own documents, was comparable to Pelosi’s.

WorldNetDaily said that Pelosi spent more than $100,000 for ""food [and] booze."" That’s false. The total includes expenses other than ""food and booze,"" though it’s certainly true that international CODELs routinely show receipts for hundreds of dollars worth of top-shelf alcohol — brands like Maker’s Mark, Courvoisier, Grey Goose and Bombay Sapphire. Pelosi herself does not drink alcohol, her staff told us, but she’s not the only member of Congress on these trips. The ones who do drink are well-supplied.

The documents also show receipts for hundreds of dollars in food purchases, often from the bulk store Sam’s Club or from the Andrews Air Force Base commissary. (It’s worth noting that, according to Pelosi’s staff, food and beverages left over after a trip are stored for future travel.) Snack items usually include cereals, fruit, chips and candy. Most of the CODELs in Judicial Watch’s sheaf of documents do not provide itemized receipts for the food used to make in-flight meals, but the one that does (a Pelosi CODEL from February 2009) lists provisions including tilapia, lasagna and fancy cakes.

Judicial Watch calculated that Pelosi’s CODELs spent precisely $101,429.14 over two years for what it calls “in-flight expenses."" Judicial Watch has a spreadsheet that covered three of the nine Pelosi CODELs represented in its documents, plus 47 speaker shuttles to and from Pelosi’s home district. From the three CODELs it covers, it’s clear that Judicial Watch is counting as “in-flight expenses” any non-reimbursable Air Force expenditure besides transportation costs. That category actually includes all non-plane costs of the trip, including baggage fees, meeting room rentals and refreshments, and, frequently, good-will lapel pins — as well as meals, ground transportation and lodging in U.S. territory.

3222,"Ok, let's see, forced fem, sissification, and bimbofication are all submission fantasies. And it's a kink that lots of people share. 

Reducing a person to their sexual bodies or behaviors sexualizes them. And in our culture, sexualizing someone (i.e., reducing them to their sexuality, rather than seeing them as a whole person) is one of the most effective ways of invalidating a person.

From [The Case Against Autogynephlia](http://www.juliaserano.com/av/Serano-CaseAgainstAutogynephilia.pdf)

&gt;Many [nontransgender] women have rape fantasies. It is one thing to respectfully attempt to explore and understand such fantasies. It is an entirely different thing to insist that there are two subtypes of women — those who have rape fantasies and those who do not; to use the label “autoraptophiles” when describing women who have such fantasies and to insist that they are primarily motivated by their desire to be raped; to include “autoraptophilia” as a modifier in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; and to encourage the lay public to actively distinguish between those women who are “autoraptophiles” and those who are not. Such actions would undoubtedly have a severe, negative impact on women (who are already routinely sexualized and marginalized in our culture). Yet, proponents of autogynephilia have argued that transsexual women should be viewed and treated in an analogous manner.

3288,"People tend to define sex in a binary way — either wholly male or wholly female — based on physical appearance or by which sex chromosomes an individual carries. But while sex and gender may seem dichotomous, there are in reality many intermediates.

 Understanding this complexity is critical; misperceptions can affect the health and civil liberties of those who fall outside perceived societal norms. Society has categorical views on what should define sex and gender, but the biological reality is just not there to support that.

 

 

Even at the most basic physical level, there is a spectrum between male and female that often goes unrecognized and risks being obscured by stigma. 

A growing body of research is showing how biology influences gender expression, sexual orientation and gender identity — characteristics that can also fall outside of strict, socially defined categories. Toy-preference tests, a popular gauge of gender expression, have long shown that boys and girls will typically gravitate to toys that are stereotypically associated with their gender (cars and guns for boys, for instance, or plush toys for girls). While one might argue that this could be the by-product of a child’s environment — parental influence at play or an internalization of societal norms — Melissa Hines, a former UCLA researcher and current professor of psychology at the University of Cambridge, in England, has shown otherwise. In 2008, she demonstrated that monkeys showed the same sex-based toy preferences as humans — absent societal influence.",2016-07-01 08:07:18+00:00,d4v3q04,10.0,t1_d4v3opx,115.0,nba

3305,"The DSMV diagnostic component of **distress is not inherent in the cross-gender identity**; rather, **it is related to social rejection and discrimination suffered by the individual**. 

I'll quote, FROM THE APA,

&gt;Is being transgender a mental disorder?  
A psychological state is considered a mental disorder only if it causes significant distress or disability. Many transgender people do not experience their gender as distressing or disabling, **which implies that identifying as transgender does not constitute a mental disorder**. For these individuals, the significant problem is finding affordable resources, such as counseling, hormone therapy, medical procedures and the social support necessary to freely express their gender identity and minimize discrimination. Many other obstacles may lead to distress, including a lack of acceptance within society, direct or indirect experiences with discrimination, or assault. These experiences may lead many transgender people to suffer with anxiety, depression or related disorders at higher rates than nontransgender persons.

We are not disordered, for three primary reasons: one, we show some basis in fact for our identification; two, unlike true delusional or somatoform disorders (which seem the most obvious comparison), psychiatric medication does not affect our feelings; and three, unlike true delusional/somatoform disorders, allowing us to pursue our feelings is far from destructive and in fact has exceptionally well-demonstrated positive results.

I'll leave you with the rather apropos quote from Billy Madison.

“What you’ve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it.

transsexual = old term that's no longer in common usage.

gender dysphoria = the condition of feeling one's emotional and psychological identity to be opposite of the gender assigned at birth.

The distress felt by people who suffer from gender dysphoria doesn’t emerge inherently from being trans but comes from the social rejection that can sometimes accompany the identity, potentially layering anguish on top of that temporary hunger for gender congruity.

trans people arent mentally ill.

Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place,  and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace.

Um, have you not read the news? Zika in PREGNANT women leads to a higher incidents of babies being born with microcephaly. See if you can follow me here

In April, the FDA approved the first commercial test, which can be administered outside government labs and hospitals. HEY! Which means Planned Parenthood can administer more test IF THEY HAD THE FUNDING.

And we can test urine now, too, which is both easier and more accurate than testing blood, which was how most Zika tests have been conducted. Which means Planned Parenthood can administer more tests IF THEY HAD THE FUNDING.

Administering an amniocentesis check, a medical procedure used in prenatal diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities and fetal infections, could confirm if the fetus has Zika. Which Planned Parenthood could administer more of IF THEY HAD THE FUNDING.

If the test is inconclusive, administration of ultrasounds every three to four weeks for the duration of the pregnancy would scan for signs of microcephaly and unusual calcium deposits in the skull. Which means Planned Parenthood can administer more tests IF THEY HAD THE FUNDING.

Republicans arent interested in anything more than demonizing Planned Parenthood and withholding funds from organizations that can actually DO something against the virus. ",2016-06-25 06:00:08+00:00,d4n94b8,10.0,t1_d4n8lpm,1380.0,politics

Once again, just because YOU havent experienced it, doesnt make it any less real. Especially when case after case has shown the same behavior. To deny that it exists despite proof shows your own willful ignorance, bigotry, and arrogance to state that YOUR opinion carries more weight than medical professionals who treat gender dysphoric children.

 &gt;Chopping off your dick, getting fake tits, taking hormones that change your body and mind, and then demanding the government get involved to force other people to put up with you... looks like fucking nutters.

Not all of us get surgery, and trans men also exist, you seem to fixate soley on trans women, showing yet again your deepset bigotry and the assumption that all trans people are just men in dresses. And as for the government  ""forcing"" people to deal with it, they were just clarifying the policies that have already been in place. 

Your last paragraph is extremely sexist. There's no one way to be a man or a woman, or even someone inbetween who doesnt identify as either.

3486,"Just because you have no concept of it, doesnt mean that it doesnt happen to other people, which it does. In gender dysphoric children, you see them gravitate towards toys and clothes, and desire to join in gender specific activities of the opposite sex. 

And thinking you're a dwarf is quite different from constant claims to be the other gender. There is no conceivable development path to literally have the mind of a dwarf from middle earth, just like there is no development path for someone to literally be Napoleon or Lincoln. Believe in reincarnation if you want, but those things are spiritual/religious and not really a matter of science and medicine.

It's fine if you ""identify"" as a dwarf, as in you feel some sort of inspiration or connection with them. That's harmless. But if you feel you're a dwarf and start wandering around with a battle axe looking for orcs to kill, it's no longer harmless and you've entered the realm of a dangerous delusion.

The primary explanation for trans people relates to how the brain develops. Depending on hormones and genetics in utero, the brain either develops along a masculine or feminine track. Nothing in biology is neat and clean. It's easy to understand that in some cases, things get mixed up a bit and you end up with a brain that is feminized in a masculine body, or a feminized brain in a masculine body. There is not, however, any development path that could somehow give them the same structure that a male sheep would have.

This is biology, not metaphysics. There's actual, real science behind this.

Besides, there's absolutely no drawback to letting the child transition socially.

3504,"Look, As best we can tell, gender identity is at least partially determined by brain structure formed very early in fetal development. A few studies show patterns typical of our identified gender and not of our birth sex.

Moreover, gender dysphoria correlates strongly with endocrine conditions - if we look at people born with externally female bodies, those with PCOS (which raises testosterone) are much more likely to ultimately identify as men; those with CAIS (which makes their bodies incapable of responding to testosterone) almost never do, to the point that single cases merit publication in their own right. On top of that, digit ratio (a marker of prenatal testosterone exposure) displays markedly low T exposure on average in trans women and high T exposure in trans men.

There's even some experimental evidence that, when cis (=not trans) people are categorized contrary to their birth sex, they experience the same distress that trans people do. Under the assumption that gender is malleable to social expectations, David Reimer was raised as a girl after a botched circumcision. He found himself uncomfortable with the female role, displayed symptoms typical of what would be expected of a trans man (that's FTM, to be clear), and ultimately transitioned to living as a man as soon as he became aware of his status in his early teens. And on the flip side, an author named Norah Vincent spent a year living as a man for the purposes of writing a book. By the end of that time, she was so depressed she checked herself into a mental institution because she was worried she might harm herself.

Additionally, trans feelings simply don't respond to psychiatric medication designed to 'cure' them. No professional organization in the world - even those that do classify us as a mental illness for (I feel) mostly historical/political reasons - recommends just giving us SSRIs or the like and sending us away. Traditional therapies simply do not work.

Compare this with Body Dysmorphic Disorder, a disorder that could be seen as an analog to trans people. BDD sufferers fixate on a small (e.g., a mole) or nonexistent part of their bodies, which they believe makes them hideous and unlovable. Some seek out treatment to remove the offending part. But BDD, unlike trans people, responds well to both therapy and SSRIs and does not respond to their desired interventions.",2016-06-19 01:02:21+00:00,d4evs3b,10.0,t1_d4evmn6,294.0,atheism

&gt;In terms of gender identity there are quite a few mental health professionals and scientists who believe that transgenderism is akin to something like an eating disorder or a delusion like believing that your hand doesn't belong to your body.

Um, again, no, gender dysphoria isnt the same as body dysmorphia.

Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), or body dysmorphia, is an anxiety disorder that causes sufferers to spend a lot of time worrying about their appearance and to have a distorted view of how they look.

Gender dysphoria is a condition where a person experiences discomfort or distress because there is a mismatch between their biological sex and gender identity...This mismatch between sex and gender identity can lead to distressing and uncomfortable feelings that are called gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is a recognised medical condition, for which treatment is sometimes appropriate. It is not a mental illness.

Those who suffer from body dysmorphia have a disconnection between the reality they are perceiving and how that perception is recognised in their brains. They look in an ordinary mirror, but for them, the result is something like we might imagine a funhouse mirror to look.

Body dysmorphia does not appear to have a specific medical treatment, although counseling and antidepressant medications are recommended. Surgery is NOT a treatment.

 It is substantially different in that one of the strongest aspects of gender dysphoria for many (but not all!) individuals who have those feelings is an acute awareness of what their physical features actually are and why those features do not match up with the gender presentation expected of the gender with which they identify.

And if acute awareness of physicality is an aspect of gender dysphoria which is precisely opposite of the defining aspect of body dysmorphia, it should follow that physical changes as the result of medical intervention would generally lead to solving feelings of dysphoria (unlike surgery for those with body dysmorphia which actually can cause more harm). And indeed, that has repeatedly been shown to be the case in [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12856892), after [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17075731), after [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19619147), after [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21699661), even with the potential for complications and need for future medical intervention post-operation for both trans women and trans men.

3590,"People tend to define sex in a binary way — either wholly male or wholly female — based on physical appearance or by which sex chromosomes an individual carries. But while sex and gender may seem dichotomous, there are in reality many intermediates.

 Understanding this complexity is critical; misperceptions can affect the health and civil liberties of those who fall outside perceived societal norms. Society has categorical views on what should define sex and gender, but the biological reality is just not there to support that.

 

 

Even at the most basic physical level, there is a spectrum between male and female that often goes unrecognized and risks being obscured by stigma. 

A growing body of research is showing how biology influences gender expression, sexual orientation and gender identity — characteristics that can also fall outside of strict, socially defined categories. Toy-preference tests, a popular gauge of gender expression, have long shown that boys and girls will typically gravitate to toys that are stereotypically associated with their gender (cars and guns for boys, for instance, or plush toys for girls). While one might argue that this could be the by-product of a child’s environment — parental influence at play or an internalization of societal norms — Melissa Hines, a former UCLA researcher and current professor of psychology at the University of Cambridge, in England, has shown otherwise. In 2008, she demonstrated that monkeys showed the same sex-based toy preferences as humans — absent societal influence.

There's a VERY wide spectrum, to reduce it to a simple binary does biology a disservice. ",2016-06-14 18:08:00+00:00,d49219p,5.0,t1_d490ff8,1919.0,atheism
3591,"Biology doesn’t work that way. Biological phenomena don’t necessarily fit into human-ordained binary categories. So while humans insist that you’re either male or female – that you have either XY or XX sex chromosomes – biology begs to differ.

For example, genetic men with Klinefelter syndrome possess an extra X chromosome (XXY) or more rarely, two or three extra Xs (XXXY, XXXXY); they typically produce low levels of testosterone, leading to less-developed masculine sexual characteristics and more-developed feminine characteristics than other men. In contrast, some men receive an extra Y chromosome (XYY) in the genetic lottery, and while they have been referred to as “supermales” that is more sensationalism than science.

Genetic women with Turner syndrome have only one X chromosome; they often display less-developed female sexual characteristics than other women. And people with a genetic mosaic possess XX chromosomes in some cells and XY in others. So how do we determine if they’re male or female? Hint: Don’t say that it depends on the chromosomal makeup of the majority of their cells, since women with more than 90 per cent XY genetic material have given birth.

Even if you get the “right” combination of sex chromosomes, it’s no guarantee that you’ll fit into the carefully circumscribed human definitions of male and female.

For example, genetic women (XX) with congenital adrenal hyperplasia produced unusually high levels of virilizing hormones in utero and develop stereotypically masculine sexual characteristics, including masculinized genitals.

Similarly, genetic men (XY) with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome don’t respond to male hormones and fail to develop masculine sexual characteristics. Most live their lives as women. Some historians suggest that Joan of Arc, Elizabeth I and Wallis Simpson all suffered from this syndrome.

So what’s the answer? There isn’t one, at least if we’re looking for the answer in biology. We must not fall back on biology. Rather, we must always remember that it is we, not biology, who decide who counts as male or female. And it is we who must take responsibility for our decisions.",2016-06-14 17:11:28+00:00,d48z72i,3.0,t1_d48trlw,6713.0,atheism

3665,"[Body Dysmorphic Disorder, or BDD](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/body-dysmorphic-disorder/basics/definition/con-20029953), is **a disorder in which your perception of your body does not align with reality**. People with BDD are caught up in a cycle of obsessive thoughts about one or more parts of their body which they believe to be noticeably flawed--the word ""dysmorphia"" itself means ""malformation."" Eating disorders fall under the BDD umbrella. Someone with an eating disorder, then, perceives a part or parts of their body to be overweight, and the obsession over that fact pushes them into a disordered relationship with food.

Transgender people, on the other hand, are diagnosed by the most recent Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM V) with [gender dysphoria](http://austenhartke.com/blog-1/2015/5/19/o08szlrrhc8jaasya9s285qenydpy6). **Gender dysphoria is not a disorder**, and is now recognized not as a condition, but as a symptom. The word **""dysphoria"" means a sense of restlessness, anxiety, dissonance, or distress**, and is the linguistic opposite of a sense of euphoria. Trans people experience this sense of distress when they contemplate the difference between the reality of their body, and the way they believe their body should be in order to align with their sense of self.

So, to sum up, body dysmorphia causes someone to believe their body is a certain way, while gender dysphoria is a sense that the body should be a different way. People with BDD are not able to see the difference between the way their body is and the way other people see their body; transgender folks are uncomfortably able to see the way their body really is, and the way that reality conflicts with their internal experience of their gender.

That's the interesting thing--one of the reasons gender dysphoria has been declassified as a disorder is because of the way treatment works. In the case of a mental disorder, psychotherapy and medication are generally shown to be helpful, and this is the case for body dysmorphia. People who suffer from eating disorders benefit greatly by cognative and behavior therapy, and by the use of anti-anxiety and depression medications, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). People dealing with gender dysphoria, on the other hand, do not experience relief from the sense of dissonance when put on medication, and though therapy is often helpful, it does not cause the dysphoria to subside.",2016-06-10 00:48:33+00:00,d4325lf,8.0,t1_d42zm6f,4121.0,atheism

&gt; Abstract: Moral perceptions of harm and fairness are instrumental in guiding how an individual navigates moral challenges. Classic research documents that the gender of a target can affect how people deploy these perceptions of harm and fairness. Across multiple studies, we explore the effect of an individual’s moral orientations (their considerations of harm and justice) and a target’s gender on altruistic behavior. Results reveal that a target’s gender can bias one’s readiness to engage in harmful actions and that a decider’s considerations of harm—but not fairness concerns—modulate costly altruism. Together, these data illustrate that moral choices are conditional on the social nature of the moral dyad: Even under the same moral constraints, a target’s gender and a decider’s gender can shift an individual’s choice to be more or less altruistic, suggesting that gender bias and harm considerations play a significant role in moral cognition.",2016-06-10 00:40:13+00:00,d431upv,2.0,t1_d430ms3,1965.0,TwoXChromosomes

3672,"Historically, we were indeed considered mentally ill. The DSM (used in the US) recently declassified us as a 'disorder', but the ICD (used in much of the rest of the world) continues to classify us as a paraphilic disorder (essentially, a fetish). It's worth pointing out, however, that the ICD didn't declassify homosexuality as a disorder until the 90s (in fact, they did so in the current version of the ICD), two decades after the DSM declassified it. It also classifies the vast majority of the population as sex disordered, since things like enjoying kinky sex are disordered by the ICD's standards. The current draft of the upcoming new ICD edition also declassifies us as mentally ill, following the DSM's example.

But I would say we are not disordered, for three primary reasons: one, we show some basis in fact for our identification; two, unlike true delusional or somatoform disorders (which seem the most obvious comparison), psychiatric medication does not affect our feelings; and three, unlike true delusional/somatoform disorders, allowing us to pursue our feelings is far from destructive and in fact has exceptionally well-demonstrated positive results.

As best we can tell, gender identity is at least partially determined by brain structure formed very early in fetal development. A few studies show patterns typical of our identified gender and not of our birth sex.

Moreover, transgenderism correlates strongly with endocrine conditions - if we look at people born with externally female bodies, those with PCOS (which raises testosterone) are much more likely to ultimately identify as men; those with CAIS (which makes their bodies incapable of responding to testosterone) almost never do, to the point that single cases merit publication in their own right. On top of that, digit ratio (a marker of prenatal testosterone exposure) displays markedly low T exposure on average in trans women and high T exposure in trans men.

There's even some experimental evidence that, when cis (=not trans) people are categorized contrary to their birth sex, they experience the same distress that trans people do. Under the assumption that gender is malleable to social expectations, David Reimer was raised as a girl after a botched circumcision. He found himself uncomfortable with the female role, displayed symptoms typical of what would be expected of a trans man (that's FTM, to be clear), and ultimately transitioned to living as a man as soon as he became aware of his status in his early teens. And on the flip side, an author named Norah Vincent spent a year living as a man for the purposes of writing a book. By the end of that time, she was so depressed she checked herself into a mental institution because she was worried she might harm herself.

Additionally, trans feelings simply don't respond to psychiatric medication designed to 'cure' them. No professional organization in the world - even those that do classify us as a mental illness for (I feel) mostly historical/political reasons - recommends just giving us SSRIs or the like and sending us away. Traditional therapies simply do not work.

Compare this with Body Dysmorphic Disorder, a disorder that could be seen as an analog to trans people. BDD sufferers fixate on a small (e.g., a mole) or nonexistent part of their bodies, which they believe makes them hideous and unlovable. Some seek out treatment to remove the offending part. But BDD, unlike trans people, responds well to both therapy and SSRIs and does not respond to their desired interventions.",2016-06-09 23:21:00+00:00,d42ywg7,6.0,t1_d42ydbl,852.0,atheism

3712,"But I would say we are not disordered, for three primary reasons: one, we show some basis in fact for our identification; two, unlike true delusional or somatoform disorders (which seem the most obvious comparison), psychiatric medication does not affect our feelings; and three, unlike true delusional/somatoform disorders, allowing us to pursue our feelings is far from destructive and in fact has exceptionally well-demonstrated positive results.

As best we can tell, gender identity is at least partially determined by brain structure formed very early in fetal development. A few studies show patterns typical of our identified gender and not of our birth sex.

Moreover, transgenderism correlates strongly with endocrine conditions - if we look at people born with externally female bodies, those with PCOS (which raises testosterone) are much more likely to ultimately identify as men; those with CAIS (which makes their bodies incapable of responding to testosterone) almost never do, to the point that single cases merit publication in their own right. On top of that, digit ratio (a marker of prenatal testosterone exposure) displays markedly low T exposure on average in trans women and high T exposure in trans men.

There's even some experimental evidence that, when cis (=not trans) people are categorized contrary to their birth sex, they experience the same distress that trans people do. Under the assumption that gender is malleable to social expectations, David Reimer was raised as a girl after a botched circumcision. He found himself uncomfortable with the female role, displayed symptoms typical of what would be expected of a trans man (that's FTM, to be clear), and ultimately transitioned to living as a man as soon as he became aware of his status in his early teens. And on the flip side, an author named Norah Vincent spent a year living as a man for the purposes of writing a book. By the end of that time, she was so depressed she checked herself into a mental institution because she was worried she might harm herself.

Additionally, trans feelings simply don't respond to psychiatric medication designed to 'cure' them. No professional organization in the world - even those that do classify us as a mental illness for (I feel) mostly historical/political reasons - recommends just giving us SSRIs or the like and sending us away. Traditional therapies simply do not work.

Compare this with Body Dysmorphic Disorder, a disorder that could be seen as an analog to trans people. BDD sufferers fixate on a small (e.g., a mole) or nonexistent part of their bodies, which they believe makes them hideous and unlovable. Some seek out treatment to remove the offending part. But BDD, unlike trans people, responds well to both therapy and SSRIs and does not respond to their desired interventions.

Historically, we were indeed considered mentally ill. The DSM (used in the US) recently declassified us as a 'disorder', but the ICD (used in much of the rest of the world) continues to classify us as a paraphilic disorder (essentially, a fetish). It's worth pointing out, however, that the ICD didn't declassify homosexuality as a disorder until the 90s (in fact, they did so in the current version of the ICD), two decades after the DSM declassified it. It also classifies the vast majority of the population as sex disordered, since things like enjoying kinky sex are disordered by the ICD's standards. The current draft of the upcoming new ICD edition also declassifies us as mentally ill, following the DSM's example.

How about we tone down the rhetoric, Obama's not ruling by fiat, we're not living in a dictatorship. 

Here’s why the U.S. Attorney General said Vanita Gupta’s division was filing suit against North Carolina:

""With respect to federal funding, the statutes we brought this lawsuit under do provide the opportunity to curtail federal funding under Title IX in the Violence Against Women Act.""
""The Violence Against Women Act specifically targets gender identity. The law and the case law around Title VII, Title IX, and the Violence Against Women Act clearly indicates HB2 is in violation of federal law.""

North Carolina is being sued by the Dept. of Justice because North Carolina willingly signed a contract with the federal government agreeing to not discriminate on the basis of gender identity and then announced that they were going to discriminate on the basis of gender identity.

Let me address the daily wire article. It's a rightwing mouthpiece, so it's uber biased. 

1) The Seattle guy wasnt trans, and was being as asshole. Trans protections laws do not allow a man to go into the ladies restroom. There are still laws against trespassing, invasion of privacy, causing a disturbance, and sexual assault.

2) This is THE only case in all of North America that someone has tried to take advantage of trans protections. However, he was caught, charged, and convicted. His claim of being trans was not a viable defense. 

3) The Virginia man wasnt trans, didnt claim to be trans

4) Again, not trans, didnt claim to be trans

5) Neither of the two guys were trans, and like i said, invasion of privacy is still a crime.

So now that we have that out of the way, let's look at the places where trans protections have been in place, shall we? (i like this part) Here's the TL;DR - There have been ZERO incidents

SEVENTEEN School Districts, from the 12 States with gender identity protections, covering 600,000 students, experienced NO problems after implementing transgender protections.

**California**

State Law Has Prohibited Discrimination In Public Schools Since 2014. On January 1, 2014, California's School Success and Opportunity Act went into effect, prohibiting discrimination against transgender students and requiring public schools to allow trans students to have access to facilities and extracurricular activities that correspond to their gender identity. [Transgender Law Center, accessed 5/29/15]

Six California School Districts Reported No Incidences Of Harassment Or Inappropriate Behavior. One month after California's law went into place, Media Matters contacted officials at the largest school districts in California to determine whether the right-wing horror stories about transgender students had come true. None of the six school districts reported incidents of harassment or inappropriate behavior, and several pledged to continue accommodating transgender students even if the law were to be repealed in a referendum. 

School Districts Had Similar Policies In Place For Years, Without Incident. Several California school districts had policies to protect transgender students long before the 2014 law came into effect, and none had any problems. The Los Angeles School District, which educates more than one in 10 of all the students enrolled in California public schools, had protections in place for nearly a decade before the law, and recorded no incidents of inappropriate behavior as a result. [Media Matters, 2/11/14]

As for your other points, you say that a medical professional should diagnose gender dysphoria, yet you spend the next few sentences diagnosing any child that shows any inkling of gender variance of NOT have gender dysphoria. Hypocrisy much? 

Let's break that down a second, if a child shows gender variance, roll with it, not every boy who wants to wear a tutu, or pink, or glitter, is going to grow up to be gay or trans. Gender dysphoria does not work like that. Likewise, a girl who likes to run and jump and tumble with the boys isnt automatically going to be a lesbian or trans.

There have been cases of children as young as 18 months who display signs of gender dysphoria. You know what ACTUAL medical professionals would do? Observation, which, if you had bothered to do a simple google search, would have told you was the recommended course of treatment. You know WHY they observe first? Because in order to get a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, the child must show consistent, insistent, and persistent sign of discomfort with their assigned gender. So if it persists, then social transition is the next step, allowing the child to change their gender presentation. Once they are close to puberty, hormone blockers are administered too delay the onset. Then, depending on the primary care physician, they will continue to monitor the child and decide when or if cross-hormone replacement therapy should be started. It's a long drawn out process, and not something that is done on a whim.

There is nothing political about it. You're the one making a link where there is none. It's based on medical research, and builds on the findings of hundreds and thousands of prior cases of gender dysphoria. 

The suicide rate comes from people like you insisting that gender dysphoria is not real, but a fantasy drummed up in the minds of liberals. Tansitioning with the support of friends and family eases the distress, that too is well documented. Again, any simple google search would have turned it up.

&gt; Is being transgender a mental disorder?

&gt;A psychological state is considered a mental disorder only if it causes significant distress or disability. Many transgender people do not experience their gender as distressing or disabling, which implies that identifying as transgender does not constitute a mental disorder. For these individuals, the significant problem is finding affordable resources, such as counseling, hormone therapy, medical procedures and the social support necessary to freely express their gender identity and minimize discrimination. Many other obstacles may lead to distress, including a lack of acceptance within society, direct or indirect experiences with discrimination, or assault. These experiences may lead many transgender people to suffer with anxiety, depression or related disorders at higher rates than nontransgender persons.

&gt;According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), people who experience intense, persistent gender incongruence can be given the diagnosis of ""gender dysphoria."" Some contend that the diagnosis inappropriately pathologizes gender noncongruence and should be eliminated. Others argue that it is essential to retain the diagnosis to ensure access to care. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is under revision and there may be changes to its current classification of intense persistent gender incongruence as ""gender identity disorder.""",2016-06-04 08:40:41+00:00,d3vk0gz,3.0,t1_d3v3f5x,35450.0,nba

3798,"Like i said in the post you neglected to read, biology isnt as simple as that, any biologist will tell you that.

And being trans is not a mental illness,  the American Psychiatric Association has this to say.

&gt; Is being transgender a mental disorder?

&gt;A psychological state is considered a mental disorder only if it causes significant distress or disability. Many transgender people do not experience their gender as distressing or disabling, which implies that identifying as transgender does not constitute a mental disorder. For these individuals, the significant problem is finding affordable resources, such as counseling, hormone therapy, medical procedures and the social support necessary to freely express their gender identity and minimize discrimination. Many other obstacles may lead to distress, including a lack of acceptance within society, direct or indirect experiences with discrimination, or assault. These experiences may lead many transgender people to suffer with anxiety, depression or related disorders at higher rates than nontransgender persons.

&gt;According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), people who experience intense, persistent gender incongruence can be given the diagnosis of ""gender dysphoria."" Some contend that the diagnosis inappropriately pathologizes gender noncongruence and should be eliminated. Others argue that it is essential to retain the diagnosis to ensure access to care. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is under revision and there may be changes to its current classification of intense persistent gender incongruence as ""gender identity disorder.""",2016-06-03 22:47:25+00:00,d3v3c39,8.0,t1_d3v33xa,383.0,nba

3805,"Biology doesn’t work that way. Biological phenomena don’t necessarily fit into human-ordained binary categories. So while humans insist that you’re either male or female – that you have either XY or XX sex chromosomes – biology begs to differ.

For example, genetic men with Klinefelter syndrome possess an extra X chromosome (XXY) or more rarely, two or three extra Xs (XXXY, XXXXY); they typically produce low levels of testosterone, leading to less-developed masculine sexual characteristics and more-developed feminine characteristics than other men. In contrast, some men receive an extra Y chromosome (XYY) in the genetic lottery, and while they have been referred to as “supermales” that is more sensationalism than science.

Genetic women with Turner syndrome have only one X chromosome; they often display less-developed female sexual characteristics than other women. And people with a genetic mosaic possess XX chromosomes in some cells and XY in others. So how do we determine if they’re male or female? Hint: Don’t say that it depends on the chromosomal makeup of the majority of their cells, since women with more than 90 per cent XY genetic material have given birth.

Even if you get the “right” combination of sex chromosomes, it’s no guarantee that you’ll fit into the carefully circumscribed human definitions of male and female.

For example, genetic women (XX) with congenital adrenal hyperplasia produced unusually high levels of virilizing hormones in utero and develop stereotypically masculine sexual characteristics, including masculinized genitals.

Similarly, genetic men (XY) with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome don’t respond to male hormones and fail to develop masculine sexual characteristics. Most live their lives as women. Some historians suggest that Joan of Arc, Elizabeth I and Wallis Simpson all suffered from this syndrome.

So what’s the answer? There isn’t one, at least if we’re looking for the answer in biology. We must not fall back on biology. Rather, we must always remember that it is we, not biology, who decide who counts as male or female. And it is we who must take responsibility for our decisions.",2016-06-03 22:02:39+00:00,d3v1p2k,4.0,t1_d3v09iv,2192.0,nba

With regard to Title IX, when the University of North Carolina took Title IX funding, they signed a contract stating that they wouldn’t discriminate based upon gender identity. In keeping with Title IX policy, the University of North Carolina has a Title IX coordinator. Her name is Elizabeth Hall. Here’s what the Department of Education’s 2015  Title IX Resource Guide for Title IX coordinators states:

&gt;Title IX protects students, employees, applicants for admission and employment, and other persons from all forms of sex discrimination, including discrimination based on gender identity or failure to conform to stereotypical notions of masculinity or femininity. All students (as well as other persons) at recipient institutions are protected by Title IX—regardless of their sex, sexual orientation, **gender identity**, part- or full-time status, disability, race, or national origin—in all aspects of a recipient’s educational programs and activities. - Page 1

And

&gt;The Title IX coordinator should also help ensure that transgender students are treated consistent with their **gender identity** in the context of single-sex classes. - Page 22

Again, North Carolina knew exactly what it was agreeing to when it entered into a contract with the Department of Education to receive Title IX funding. The only actual story here is that North Carolina wants the special right to receive funding under federal contracts they’ve declared they’ve no intention of honoring.

3853,"Here’s why the U.S. Attorney General said Vanita Gupta’s division was filing suit against North Carolina:

""With respect to federal funding, the statutes we brought this lawsuit under do provide the opportunity to curtail federal funding under Title IX in the Violence Against Women Act.""

""The Violence Against Women Act specifically targets gender identity. The law and the case law around Title VII, Title IX, and the Violence Against Women Act clearly indicates HB2 is in violation of federal law.""

North Carolina is being sued by the Dept. of Justice because North Carolina willingly signed a contract with the federal government agreeing to not discriminate on the basis of gender identity and then announced that they were going to discriminate on the basis of gender identity.

Even though VAWA and Title IX funding comes with explicit prohibitions regarding discrimination on the basis of gender identity, McCrory has claimed numerous times that Congress needs to figure out what gender identity means since they’ve not addressed it. Apparently he doesn’t know that in the very Congressional Act he took money from --the VAWA-- the act spells all of this out.

By the way, it was a Republican Congress that passed the following language and furthermore, a Republican Congress that explicitly approved banning discrimination on the basis of gender identity:

&gt;No person in the United States shall, on the basis of actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, sex, **gender identity (as defined in paragraph 249(c)(4) of title 18, United States Code)**, sexual orientation, or disability, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity funded in whole or in part with funds made available under the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (title IV of Public Law 103–322 ; 108 Stat. 1902), the Violence Against Women Act of 2000 (division B of Public Law 106–386; 114 Stat. 1491), the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 (title IX of Public Law 109–162 ; 119 Stat. 3080), the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 , and any other program or activity funded in whole or in part with funds appropriated for grants, cooperative agreements, and other assistance administered by the Office on Violence Against Women.

3877,"I know it may seem strange that i keep harping on it, but semantics are very important. 

From the APA:- 

Is being transgender a mental disorder?

A psychological state is considered a mental disorder only if it causes significant distress or disability. Many transgender people do not experience their gender as distressing or disabling, which implies that identifying as transgender does not constitute a mental disorder. For these individuals, the significant problem is finding affordable resources, such as counseling, hormone therapy, medical procedures and the social support necessary to freely express their gender identity and minimize discrimination. Many other obstacles may lead to distress, including a lack of acceptance within society, direct or indirect experiences with discrimination, or assault. These experiences may lead many transgender people to suffer with anxiety, depression or related disorders at higher rates than nontransgender persons.
According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), people who experience intense, persistent gender incongruence can be given the diagnosis of ""gender dysphoria."" Some contend that the diagnosis inappropriately pathologizes gender noncongruence and should be eliminated. Others argue that it is essential to retain the diagnosis to ensure access to care. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is under revision and there may be changes to its current classification of intense persistent gender incongruence as ""gender identity disorder.""

But i agree with you that it SHOULDNT be a national problem.",2016-06-01 23:27:46+00:00,d3sesmh,15.0,t1_d3se9j0,819.0,politics

3885,"Biology doesn’t work that way. Biological phenomena don’t necessarily fit into human-ordained binary categories. So while humans insist that you’re either male or female – that you have either XY or XX sex chromosomes – biology begs to differ.

For example, genetic men with Klinefelter syndrome possess an extra X chromosome (XXY) or more rarely, two or three extra Xs (XXXY, XXXXY); they typically produce low levels of testosterone, leading to less-developed masculine sexual characteristics and more-developed feminine characteristics than other men. In contrast, some men receive an extra Y chromosome (XYY) in the genetic lottery, and while they have been referred to as “supermales” that is more sensationalism than science.

Genetic women with Turner syndrome have only one X chromosome; they often display less-developed female sexual characteristics than other women. And people with a genetic mosaic possess XX chromosomes in some cells and XY in others. So how do we determine if they’re male or female? Hint: Don’t say that it depends on the chromosomal makeup of the majority of their cells, since women with more than 90 per cent XY genetic material have given birth.

Even if you get the “right” combination of sex chromosomes, it’s no guarantee that you’ll fit into the carefully circumscribed human definitions of male and female.

For example, genetic women (XX) with congenital adrenal hyperplasia produced unusually high levels of virilizing hormones in utero and develop stereotypically masculine sexual characteristics, including masculinized genitals.

Similarly, genetic men (XY) with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome don’t respond to male hormones and fail to develop masculine sexual characteristics. Most live their lives as women. Some historians suggest that Joan of Arc, Elizabeth I and Wallis Simpson all suffered from this syndrome.

So what’s the answer? There isn’t one, at least if we’re looking for the answer in biology. We must not fall back on biology. Rather, we must always remember that it is we, not biology, who decide who counts as male or female. And it is we who must take responsibility for our decisions.",2016-06-01 21:18:37+00:00,d3s9joy,9.0,t1_d3s7v1a,2257.0,politics

It's like looking at yourself and a part of you that you KNOW is supposed to be there isnt. This is different than Body Dysmorphic Disorder, a disorder that could be seen as an analog to trans people. BDD sufferers fixate on a small (e.g., a mole) or nonexistent part of their bodies, which they believe makes them hideous and unlovable. Some seek out treatment to remove the offending part. But BDD, unlike gender dysphoria, responds well to both therapy and SSRIs and does not respond to their desired interventions.

3894,"But I would say we are not mentally ill, for three primary reasons: one, we show some basis in fact for our identification; two, unlike true delusional or somatoform disorders (which seem the most obvious comparison), psychiatric medication does not affect our feelings; and three, unlike true delusional/somatoform disorders, allowing us to pursue our feelings is far from destructive and in fact has exceptionally well-demonstrated positive results.

As best we can tell, gender identity is at least partially determined by brain structure formed very early in fetal development. A few studies show patterns typical of our identified gender and not of our birth sex.

Moreover, transgenderism correlates strongly with endocrine conditions - if we look at people born with externally female bodies, those with PCOS (which raises testosterone) are much more likely to ultimately identify as men; those with CAIS (which makes their bodies incapable of responding to testosterone) almost never do, to the point that single cases merit publication in their own right. On top of that, digit ratio (a marker of prenatal testosterone exposure) displays markedly low T exposure on average in trans women and high T exposure in trans men.

There's even some experimental evidence that, when cis (=not trans) people are categorized contrary to their birth sex, they experience the same distress that trans people do. Under the assumption that gender is malleable to social expectations, David Reimer was raised as a girl after a botched circumcision. He found himself uncomfortable with the female role, displayed symptoms typical of what would be expected of a trans man (that's FTM, to be clear), and ultimately transitioned to living as a man as soon as he became aware of his status in his early teens. And on the flip side, an author named Norah Vincent spent a year living as a man for the purposes of writing a book. By the end of that time, she was so depressed she checked herself into a mental institution because she was worried she might harm herself.

Additionally, trans feelings simply don't respond to psychiatric medication designed to 'cure' them. No professional organization in the world - even those that do classify us as a mental illness for (I feel) mostly historical/political reasons - recommends just giving us SSRIs or the like and sending us away. Traditional therapies simply do not work.

Historically, we were indeed considered mentally ill. The DSM (used in the US) recently declassified us as a 'disorder', but the ICD (used in much of the rest of the world) continues to classify us as a paraphilic disorder (essentially, a fetish). It's worth pointing out, however, that the ICD didn't declassify homosexuality as a disorder until the 90s (in fact, they did so in the current version of the ICD), two decades after the DSM declassified it. It also classifies the vast majority of the population as sex disordered, since things like enjoying kinky sex are disordered by the ICD's standards.

3896,"G.G. ex rel. Grimm v. Gloucester Cty. Sch. Bd., __ F.3d __, 2016 WL 1567467 (4th Cir. Apr. 19, 2016). The district court dismissed a Title IX sex discrimination claim brought by a transgender boy high school student who was denied access to the boys' restroom. Reversing and remanding the case for further proceedings, the Court of Appeals held: ""At the heart of this appeal is whether Title IX requires schools to provide transgender students access to restrooms congruent with their gender identity,"" and the district court failed to give appropriate deference to the U.S. Department of Education's interpretation of how its own sex discrimination regulation should apply to transgender students. That interpretation was set forth in a January 15, 2015 letter from the Department's Office for Civil Rights, which advised: ""When a school elects to separate or treat students differently on the basis of sex . . . a school generally must treat transgender students consistent with their gender identity.""

Smith v. City of Salem, 378 F.3d 566 (6th Cir. 2004).  The plaintiff alleged that he was suspended based on sex after he began to express a more feminine appearance and notified his employer that he would eventually undergo a complete physical transformation from male to female.  The court held that Title VII prohibits discrimination against transgender individuals based on gender stereotyping.  The court determined that discrimination against an individual for gender-nonconforming behavior violates Title VII irrespective of the cause of the behavior.  The court reasoned that the ""narrow view"" of the term ""sex"" in prior case law denying Title VII protection to transgender employees was ""eviscerated"" by Price Waterhouse, in which the Supreme Court held that Title VII protected a woman who failed to conform to social expectations about how women should look and behave. 

Finkle v. Howard Cnty., Md., 122 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 861, 2014 WL 1396386 (D. Md. Apr. 10, 2014).  Denying the county's motion to dismiss or for summary judgment on a Title VII claim brought by a volunteer auxiliary police officer, the court ruled that the officer was an ""employee"" for Title VII purposes, and that her claim that she was discriminated against ""because of her obvious transgendered status"" raised a cognizable claim of sex discrimination.  The court reasoned:  ""[I]t would seem that any discrimination against transsexuals (as transsexuals) - individuals who, by definition, do not conform to gender stereotypes - is proscribed by Title VII's proscription of discrimination on the basis of sex as interpreted by Price Waterhouse.  As Judge Robertson offered in Schroer[ v. Billington, 577 F. Supp. 2d 293 (D.D.C. 2008)], '[u]ltimately I do not think it matters for purposes of Title VII liability whether the Library withdrew its offer of employment because it perceived Schroer to be an insufficiently masculine man, an insufficiently feminine woman, or an inherently gender-nonconforming transsexual.'""

Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228 (1989).  The Supreme Court recognized that employment discrimination based on sex stereotypes (e.g., assumptions and/or expectations about how persons of a certain sex should dress, behave, etc.) is unlawful sex discrimination under Title VII.  Price Waterhouse had denied Ann Hopkins a promotion in part because other partners at the firm felt that she did not act as woman should act.  She was told, among other things, that she needed to ""walk more femininely, talk more femininely, [and] dress more femininely"" in order to secure a partnership. Id. at 230-31, 235.  The Court found that this constituted evidence of sex discrimination as ""[i]n the . . . context of sex stereotyping, an employer who acts on the basis of a belief that a woman cannot be aggressive, or that she must not be, has acted on the basis of gender."" Id. at 250.   The Court further explained that Title VII's ""because of sex"" provision strikes at the ""entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women resulting from sex stereotypes."" Id.

Now with that out of the way, I'll tell you what it means to me personally. Even if my brain scans came back and they were no different than a cis person's...... I would STILL be female. This is something I KNOW, it's something I've known since I was 7. 

My parents asked me how I could be so sure, and I couldnt really answer. I know, I cant tell you how I know, I just do. To the very core of my being I know I'm female.

That's not to say I'm cis tho, I will never be wholly female or wholly male. I'm a trans female. I'm somewhere inbetweeny.

Arent labels funny? Growing up in Asia, I was always ""that half white kid"", when I came over to the States, I was ""that half asian dude"". Now I'm ""that atheist mixed race transgender polyamorous lesbian.""

4005,"Transgender, as a word, describes folks who were assigned a sex or gender at birth incongruent with their actual sex or gender. Transgender is an adjective – it cannot stand on its own, but must be attached to a noun. Like other adjectives, transgender exists to modify and clarify some aspect of the noun at hand.

It is not a noun. Or verb. It describes an aspect of a noun. But like other adjectives in formal language– green, strong, female, etc. – it describes the type of noun in question, and explains something about a noun that’s relevant to the context.

Transgender is not a noun. It is an adjective, and reducing people to just one of their qualities is necessarily reductive and denies their gender and their humanity.

Using transgender as a noun is occasionally an ignorant, symptomatic mistake made by a careless writer. But more often, it’s an indicator of more issues: transgender or cross-dressing male to describe trans women, a she where a he is needed. It is indicative of a pattern of dehumanization, of degendering. 

Transgender is also not a verb because gender is not a verb. I do not cisgender every day when I put on a skirt or wash my genitals. I do not gender when I do anything, because gender is not a verb. Using transgender as such reflects a lack of understanding and avoidance of research on the part of the writer.

Transgender can modify “woman” in the case that the woman in question was assigned male at birth. Transgender can modify “man” in the case that the man in question was assigned female at birth. Transgender can modify “person” when talking about (particularly though not exclusively) nonbinary folks on the trans spectrum. Transgender can modify “people” when talking about a community, and “issues” when talking about issues of concern to the trans community. Transgender can modify whatever nouns can be used to describe a trans person. Trans mother, trans father, trans political candidate, trans writer, trans blogger, trans journalist, trans veteran, trans student.

Transgender even as an adjective is not always necessary. Woman and man describe trans woman and trans man just fine, and in fact, that’s probably better unless the story is somehow about them being trans. And it almost always is about the person in question’s trans status, because that is what folks without cis privilege are reduced to.

Describing a person as ""a transgender"", article and all, is dehumanizing because it makes the person in question less than a noun: it defines them as not a person; they are not even a thing, a place, or an idea. They are an adjective: one aspect of their life that has been pulled out of context of their humanity to mock and to shock.

These words as a word doesn’t exist on its own. It is an adjective, a word used to further describe a person, a noun. Transgender is a quality, not an entity.",2016-05-26 20:39:12+00:00,d3kx7yx,10.0,t1_d3kwyio,343.0,politics

4015,"You DO realize that what you're quoting comes from McHugh's article in the Wall Street Journal? His biased and dangerous misrepresentation of evidence on transgender people was called out by prominent members of the American Psychiatric Association in a rebuttal letter to the Journal, as was his flagrant misuse of a 2011 study on outcomes for post-operative transgender people by Dr. Celia Dhejne. His deliberate misinterpretation of the 2011 study led Dr. Dhejne to publicly denounce McHugh’s actions as “unethical.”

John Hopkins University’s Dr. Cynthia Osborne has been a witness in at least three cases in which transgender people were seeking health care. She says prisoners should never receive gender-confirmation surgery. As a result of her testimony, all three inmates lost their cases, and two of them resorted to self-castration out of desperation.

The university’s Dr. Chester Schmidt has also been a star for defendants who wish to ignore standards of care. Schmidt testified that he has never recommended transgender surgery out of the 300 transgender patients he's had. During his testimony, Schmidt stated (against WPATH standards of care) that the correct course of treatment for gender dysphoria is, in his opinion, “psychotherapy and medication.” Schmidt has availed himself of right-wing news outlets to make a case that transgender people should not be given affirming care.

The study McHugh ran in the late 1970s was deeply flawed and biased, having been designed to get a particular answer. As a result, the psychiatric community no longer considers this study persuasive or credible. Fellow psychiatry staff member Dr. Thomas Wise has also espoused similarly outdated, offensive views on transgender people, including a belief that transgender people need reparative therapy, and not affirming medical care.  

And you want to quote studies??? There are far more studies that show that transitioning alleviates dysphoria.

[ After gender reassignment, in young adulthood, the GD was alleviated and psychological functioning had steadily improved. ](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958.abstract)

[Heylans et al., 2014](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12363/abstract): ""A difference in SCL-90 [a test of distress, anxiety, and hostility] overall psychoneurotic distress was observed at the different points of assessments (P = 0.003), with the most prominent decrease occurring after the initiation of hormone therapy (P &lt; 0.001)...Furthermore, the SCL-90 scores resembled those of a general population after hormone therapy was initiated.""

[Colizzi et al., 2013](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12155/abstract): ""At enrollment, transsexuals reported elevated CAR ['cortisol awakening response', a physiological measure of stress]; their values were out of normal. They expressed higher perceived stress and more attachment insecurity, with respect to normative sample data. When treated with hormone therapy [at followup, 1 year after beginning HRT], transsexuals reported significantly lower CAR (P &lt; 0.001), falling within the normal range for cortisol levels. Treated transsexuals showed also lower perceived stress (P &lt; 0.001), with levels similar to normative samples.""

[Gomez-Gil et al., 2012](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21937168): ""SADS, HAD-A, and HAD-Depression (HAD-D) mean scores [these are tests of depression and anxiety] were significantly higher among patients who had not begun cross-sex hormonal treatment compared with patients in hormonal treatment (F=4.362, p=.038; F=14.589, p=.001; F=9.523, p=.002 respectively). Similarly, current symptoms of anxiety and depression were present in a significantly higher percentage of untreated patients than in treated patients (61% vs. 33% and 31% vs. 8% respectively).""

4016,"I said this in an earlier thread, biology doesn’t work that way. Biological phenomena don’t necessarily fit into human-ordained binary categories. So while humans insist that you’re either male or female – that you have either XY or XX sex chromosomes – biology begs to differ.

For example, genetic men with Klinefelter syndrome possess an extra X chromosome (XXY) or more rarely, two or three extra Xs (XXXY, XXXXY); they typically produce low levels of testosterone, leading to less-developed masculine sexual characteristics and more-developed feminine characteristics than other men. In contrast, some men receive an extra Y chromosome (XYY) in the genetic lottery, and while they have been referred to as “supermales” that is more sensationalism than science.

Genetic women with Turner syndrome have only one X chromosome; they often display less-developed female sexual characteristics than other women. And people with a genetic mosaic possess XX chromosomes in some cells and XY in others. So how do we determine if they’re male or female? Hint: Don’t say that it depends on the chromosomal makeup of the majority of their cells, since women with more than 90 per cent XY genetic material have given birth.

Even if you get the “right” combination of sex chromosomes, it’s no guarantee that you’ll fit into the carefully circumscribed human definitions of male and female.

For example, genetic women (XX) with congenital adrenal hyperplasia produced unusually high levels of virilizing hormones in utero and develop stereotypically masculine sexual characteristics, including masculinized genitals.

Similarly, genetic men (XY) with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome don’t respond to male hormones and fail to develop masculine sexual characteristics. Most live their lives as women. Some historians suggest that Joan of Arc, Elizabeth I and Wallis Simpson all suffered from this syndrome.

A growing body of research is showing how biology influences gender expression, sexual orientation and gender identity — characteristics that can also fall outside of strict, socially defined categories. Toy-preference tests, a popular gauge of gender expression, have long shown that boys and girls will typically gravitate to toys that are stereotypically associated with their gender (cars and guns for boys, for instance, or plush toys for girls). While one might argue that this could be the by-product of a child’s environment — parental influence at play or an internalization of societal norms — Melissa Hines, a former UCLA researcher and current professor of psychology at the University of Cambridge, in England, has shown otherwise. In 2008, she demonstrated that monkeys showed the same sex-based toy preferences as humans — absent societal influence.

So what’s the answer? There isn’t one, at least if we’re looking for the answer in biology. We must not fall back on biology. Rather, we must always remember that it is we, not biology, who decide who counts as male or female. And it is we who must take responsibility for our decisions.

4034,"Doctors say the benefit of using puberty blockers is that they block hormone-induced biological changes, such as vocal chord changes, the development of breast tissue or changes in facial structure, that are irreversible and can be especially distressing to children who are gender-non conforming or transgender.

The use of puberty blockers to treat transgender children is what’s considered an “off label” use of the medication — something that hasn’t been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. And doctors say their biggest concern is about how long children stay on the medication, because there isn’t enough research into the effects of stalling puberty at the age when children normally go through it.

The stakes are higher for children who want to continue physically transitioning by taking the hormones of their desired gender. Doctors grapple with when to start cross-sex hormones, and they say it really depends on the child’s readiness and stability in their gender identity.

While the Endocrine Society’s guidelines suggest 16, more and more children are starting hormones at 13 or 14 once their doctors, therapists and families have agreed that they are mentally and emotionally prepared. The shift is because of the concerns over the impact that delaying puberty for too long can have on development, physically, emotionally and socially.

The physical changes that hormones bring about are irreversible, making the decision more weighty than taking puberty blockers. Some of the known side effects of hormones include things that might sound familiar: acne and changes in mood. Patients are also warned that they may be at higher risk for heart disease or diabetes later in life. The risk of blood clots increases for those who start estrogen. And the risk for cancer is an unknown, but it is included in the warnings doctors give their patients.

Another potential dilemma facing transgender children, their families and their doctors is this: Taking cross hormones can reduce fertility. And there isn’t enough research to find out of it is reversible or not. So when children make the decision to start taking hormones, they have to consider whether they ever want to have biological children.

Here's a study about it:-

and

The stress comes as we try to deny it, that's why so many of us join the army, both men and women, and for the same reason, to ""man"" up. The stress comes from the stigma attached to the condition. Growing up, i saw how society treated queer people, and trans people in particular were always labeled as freaks. 

The suicide rate in our community is ridiculously high, hovering at about 40%. In comparison, the suicide rate in the United States in 2014 was 13 per 100,000 people, the highest recorded rate in 28 years. The only other group that comes close to matching the trans community's suicide rate are veterans with PTSD. A recent analysis found a suicide rate among veterans of about 30 per 100,000 population per year.

And then there's the harassment the trans people endure on a daily basis, in employment, in their social life, in their family life. There's enormous pressure from some areas that would depress even the strongest person.

4055,"And if you want to get complicated, biological phenomena don’t necessarily fit into human-ordained binary categories. So while humans insist that you’re either male or female – that you have either XY or XX sex chromosomes – biology begs to differ.

For example, genetic men with Klinefelter syndrome possess an extra X chromosome (XXY) or more rarely, two or three extra Xs (XXXY, XXXXY); they typically produce low levels of testosterone, leading to less-developed masculine sexual characteristics and more-developed feminine characteristics than other men. In contrast, some men receive an extra Y chromosome (XYY) in the genetic lottery, and while they have been referred to as “supermales” that is more sensationalism than science.

Genetic women with Turner syndrome have only one X chromosome; they often display less-developed female sexual characteristics than other women. And people with a genetic mosaic possess XX chromosomes in some cells and XY in others. So how do we determine if they’re male or female? Hint: Don’t say that it depends on the chromosomal makeup of the majority of their cells, since women with more than 90 per cent XY genetic material have given birth.

Even if you get the “right” combination of sex chromosomes, it’s no guarantee that you’ll fit into the carefully circumscribed human definitions of male and female.

For example, genetic women (XX) with congenital adrenal hyperplasia produced unusually high levels of virilizing hormones in utero and develop stereotypically masculine sexual characteristics, including masculinized genitals.

Similarly, genetic men (XY) with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome don’t respond to male hormones and fail to develop masculine sexual characteristics. Most live their lives as women. Some historians suggest that Joan of Arc, Elizabeth I and Wallis Simpson all suffered from this syndrome.

So what’s the answer? There isn’t one, at least if we’re looking for the answer in biology. We must not fall back on biology. Rather, we must always remember that it is we, not biology, who decide who counts as male or female. And it is we who must take responsibility for our decisions.",2016-05-26 04:27:23+00:00,d3k1ung,5.0,t1_d3k1n5l,412.0,science

In Gates' report, he looked at a Massachusetts survey conducted between 2007 and 2009, which found that 0.5 percent of adults between the ages of 18 and 64 identified themselves as being transgender.

Gates also examined data from a 2003 survey in California, which found that 3.2 percent of LGBT individuals identified themselves as transgender. Combined with surveys of the number of lesbian, gay or bisexual adults in California, this finding translates to about 0.1 percent of California adults being transgender, Gates wrote.

All the surveys are from a time before time, before the Great Transgender Tipping Point^^TM of 2012. So you can bet your bottom dollar that the figure is woefully underestimated.",2016-05-23 02:24:44+00:00,d3fwfl1,2.0,t1_d3fvm1v,1154.0,TransSpace

In other words, if your 4-year-old son wants to wear a dress or says he wants to be a girl once or twice, he probably is not transgender; but if your child who was assigned male at birth repeatedly insists over the course of several months that she is a girl, then she is probably transgender.

For example, genetic men with Klinefelter syndrome possess an extra X chromosome (XXY) or more rarely, two or three extra Xs (XXXY, XXXXY); they typically produce low levels of testosterone, leading to less-developed masculine sexual characteristics and more-developed feminine characteristics than other men. In contrast, some men receive an extra Y chromosome (XYY) in the genetic lottery, and while they have been referred to as “supermales” that is more sensationalism than science.

Genetic women with Turner syndrome have only one X chromosome; they often display less-developed female sexual characteristics than other women. And people with a genetic mosaic possess XX chromosomes in some cells and XY in others. So how do we determine if they’re male or female? Hint: Don’t say that it depends on the chromosomal makeup of the majority of their cells, since women with more than 90 per cent XY genetic material have given birth.

Even if you get the “right” combination of sex chromosomes, it’s no guarantee that you’ll fit into the carefully circumscribed human definitions of male and female.

For example, genetic women (XX) with congenital adrenal hyperplasia produced unusually high levels of virilizing hormones in utero and develop stereotypically masculine sexual characteristics, including masculinized genitals.

Similarly, genetic men (XY) with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome don’t respond to male hormones and fail to develop masculine sexual characteristics. Most live their lives as women. Some historians suggest that Joan of Arc, Elizabeth I and Wallis Simpson all suffered from this syndrome.

So what’s the answer? There isn’t one, at least if we’re looking for the answer in biology. We must not fall back on biology. Rather, we must always remember that it is we, not biology, who decide who counts as male or female. And it is we who must take responsibility for our decisions.",2016-05-20 23:53:47+00:00,d3dkz87,6.0,t1_d3dko18,554.0,politics

1961 - A report that the Louisiana State Advisory Committee issued to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. It details the chaos of desegregation in the state, and highlights what critics at the time were saying about what it meant for the parents of white girls. “Don’t wait for your daughters to be raped by these Congolese,” Leander Perez, a leader of the White Citizens’ Council of Louisiana, told a crowd of 5,000 gathered at a meeting in New Orleans. “Do something about it now.”

Usually, the process in schools is that you have to provide a therapist's letter. And if you think that kids would declare that they're transgender on a whim, then you dont remember how it was in school. You usually DONT want to stand out.

&gt;You're assuming every trans person is going through hormonal therapy. 

No, what i was saying is that if you wished to play on a sports team in college, you need to have completed at least one year on hormone replacement therapy. If you're in highschool, state policies vary, a transgender student’s opportunity to participate on high school athletic teams is determined by the state in which they live.

Yeah, but what the hell does that have to do with trasn people. Trans women are women, trans men are men.

&gt;But now all it takes is for that man to say that he is a woman and now he can have the legal protection to use the woman's bathroom.

*sigh* it doesnt work that way.

&gt;This isn't about segregation.

Yes, yes it is. That's the only word to use if you want to deny the right of trans people to use the restrooms of the gender they identify with. 

&gt;And you know how we sepearate school sport teams based on sex, even through title 9?

Since you brought it up. Specifically, the guidance states that “Title IX’s sex discrimination prohibition extends to claims of discrimination based on gender identity or failure to conform to stereotypical notions of masculinity or femininity and OCR accepts such complaints for investigation.”

&gt;That means that a trans women with the body or a man has the right to go out for the women's volleyball team. 

Actually, both the NCAA as well as the IOC has guidelines for athletes who wish to compete in sports of the gender they are transitioning to. Both require at least a year on hormone replacement therapy before being allowed to compete.  

Also, there is no effective competitive advantage in being a transgender woman. Most measures of physical strength minimize, muscle mass decreases, bone density decreases, and they become fairly comparable to women in their musculature. After enough ti,e has passed, if tested, they would probably end up in the same muscle mass category as her cisgender female counterpart. 

Full disclosure: I know several trans girls who are currently competing on volleyball teams in their schools.

That's the problem when people pull a convo out of context. That thread was pulled from a trans support sub that i mod. On that sub, every trans person there knows the procedure for Hormone Replacement Therapy. And the regimen for pretty much everyone under 16 is the administration of hormone blockers. While there are always exceptions, you dont usually start a minor off on hormones. So for anyone suggesting that they come on over so i can stab them in the ass with unprescribed hormones is the trans equivalent of saying, ""Hey kid, here the keys, why dont you run on down to the store and buy me some smokes and alcohol."" 

But the transphobes who trawl through the sub love pulling threads and making them into something that they're not. That particular gem was posted on a transphobic website that constantly misgenders and demonizes transpeople.

4271,"[From the Intersex Society of America](http://www.isna.org/faq/y_chromosome):-

...more than the SRY is needed for sex determination and differentiation; for example, women with CAIS have the SRY gene but lack androgen receptors. In terms of hormone effects on their bodies (including their brains), women with CAIS have had much less “masculinization” than the average 46,XX woman because their cells do not respond to androgens.

Moreover, the SRY gene can be translocated onto an X chromosome (so that a 46,XX person may develop along a typical masculine pathway), and there are dozens of genes on chromosomes other than the X and the Y that contribute to sexual differentiation. And beyond the genes, a person’s sex development can be significantly influenced by environmental factors (including the maternal uterine environment in which the fetus developed).

So it is simply incorrect to think that you can tell a person’s sex just looking at whether he or she has a Y chromosome.

Developed countries on the other hand, tend to have a lower fertility rate due to lifestyle choices associated with economic affluence where mortality rates are low, birth control is easily accessible and children often can become an economic drain caused by housing, education cost and other cost involved in bringing up children.

4311,"You  fail to grasp the historic complexities of Title VII’s sex provision. The provision has always been contested, it was largely up to courts to interpret the ""sex"" part of the provision.

Over the years, the courts deepened and broadened their interpretation of sex discrimination. In the Supreme Court’s first Title VII case, in 1971, the justices unanimously ruled against a defense contractor that refused to hire mothers of small children, but not fathers, because it considered them less committed to the job. In 1977, it rejected Alabama’s height and weight requirements for prison guard applicants, a policy that screened out most women. The next year, the court ruled against the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which required female workers to pay nearly 15 percent more of their paychecks into an employee-funded pension plan, because women, as a group, outlived men. 

Sexual harassment, a concept that didn’t even have a name in 1964, was finally acknowledged by the court in a unanimous 1986 decision to be discrimination because of sex. About a decade later, the court expanded Title VII’s coverage of sexual harassment by outlawing same-sex harassment, too.

Even Scalia, when he weighed in said that legal protections offered by Title VII “often go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably comparable evils,” and what matters is the law itself, “rather than the principal concerns of our legislators.”

Ann Hopkins’s successful lawsuit against Price Waterhouse in 1989 became the template on which later gender identity (not to mention sexual orientation) lawsuits have been based. The court ruled, in effect, that punishing a woman for failing to conform to her employer’s notion of “womanhood” was just as discriminatory as treating her poorly because she was a woman.

This is about more than bathrooms. It’s about guaranteeing civil rights and encouraging acceptance for yet another group of Americans that has waited far too long for both.

Girls play on boys’ teams in Little League baseball, and there have even been female place kickers in college football. So why can’t women be kickers in professional football — as long as they can take the hits? What about sports like gymnastics and figure skating, where the judging is based on supposed sexual differences: strength for men, grace for women? Is this another outmoded gender distinction? 

&gt;But sex and gender are two different things.

Now who's being disingenuous? The whole point of the bathroom bills is to prevent trans people from using the bathroom of the gender they identify with; to make them use the bathrooms of the gender that they put down on their birth certificate. 

&gt;So what you're saying is transes should be allowed to go into the shower with females, 

All the gyms i have showered in have private stalls for showering, and i wrap the towel around me when i get out and i change on the benches in the center

&gt;That doesn't breakdown assaults on transes who went into their biologically matched bathrooms, locker rooms, or showers.

No, but it does show that trans people are targeted specifically because of their gender identity.

&gt;Again, since gender identity is only within the mind of the beholder, that essentially makes all facilities unisex.

Again, the solution is to have stand-alone facilities, then we can stop all this ridonkulous arguments and move on to something more substantial",2016-05-11 22:11:58+00:00,d31x14d,14.0,t1_d31u63y,3935.0,politics

4362,"&gt;  aren't then all sports equal opportunities for women and men to participate?

Title IX requires that women and men be provided equitable opportunities to participate in sports. Title IX does not require institutions to offer identical sports but an equal opportunity to play.

&gt;So is, apparently decades of Title IX application in college athletics.

See above

&gt;Privacy in restrooms is a strawman. There already is low-privacy risk in bathrooms. The concern for bathrooms is safety since trans-access laws would essentially make all bathrooms unisex.

Not true, the Department of Education’s regulations explicitly state that “separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex” are permissible. The DoJ is saying that you cant keep trans people out of the restrooms of the gender that they identify with.

&gt;If transgenders have a right to control which sex can see them naked, why don't others have that same right?

Trans people arent sexual deviants, they're not in the habit of stripping down and showing off their naughty bits. More often than not, they want to change in the privacy of their own stalls, and tend to skip taking showers if they're set up communally. And again, it's still illegal to trespass and assault. Also, why only focus on trans people? What about gay people? Following that logic, arent gay people more likely to assault members of their own sex if they find them attractive? 

&gt;Do you have stats on this violence?

Yup. The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs[ has a good breakdown](http://www.avp.org/storage/documents/ncavp_transhvfactsheet.pdf)

&gt;Charlotte passed their law first mandating all bathrooms in public and businesses be unisex.

False, here's the actual verbiage from Charlotte's amendment to the equal protection law:- 

&gt;A place of public accommodation may not refuse to provide the full and equal enjoyment of its facilities based on a protected characteristic, such as gender identity and gender expression. Restrooms, locker rooms, and other changing facilities are covered by the ordinance.  
The ordinance does NOT require the elimination of separate men’s and women’s facilities, and does not require a business to provide new or special restroom facilities. However, a business may not prohibit a transgender person from using the restroom or locker room consistent with the gender identified or expressed by that person.  
The ordinance does not require a business to modify or reconstruct existing men’s and women’s restroom or changing facilities, although it may choose to do so to accommodate the privacy of its
customers. Restroom facilities designated and signed for males or females are permissible and do not violate the ordinance.",2016-05-11 20:41:27+00:00,d31sz9f,12.0,t1_d31qwbw,2569.0,politics

4364,"Title IX states that: No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity **receiving Federal financial assistance**. 

That being said, i have the view that if you are male, you could argue that women's colleges are in violation of Title IX for not letting you apply. Segregation on the basis of sex is a product of an outdated age. 

And i take issue with ""biological sex"". A trans person who has had reassignment surgery and who has changed the gender marker on their drivers license and birth certificate, will be indistinguishable from a cisgender woman. But that discriminates against the trans people who havent had the surgery or dont want to have the surgery. 

To the topic of privacy,  as though female restrooms don't already afford privacy stalls. As though trans people haven't discreetly and without incident been using bathrooms and locker rooms corresponding to their non-birth gender identity for decades. As though those who have endured the alienating, socially disruptive and sometimes dangerous process of transitioning have done so merely to get furtive peeks at others' private parts.

When you start forcing transgender students to use a different bathroom, THEIR privacy gets violated. Transgender people will have to essentially out themselves by suddenly using a different bathroom. It would force them to share private medical information against their will and, perhaps more damaging, open themselves up to bullying and violence.

But for the non-binary trans people, they tend to stick out because they dont conform to the gender binary, and that tends to squick some people out.

Again, i agree with you on some points, there are gender fluid people.

&gt;How can you provide protections for something that no external observer can verify without them being open to literally everyone. 

[Slate had a good take on it.](http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2016/05/10/in_the_battle_over_bathroom_privacy_transgender_people_s_needs_matter_more.html) While the details of the purported privacy violations caused by the presence of transgender individuals are rarely spelled out completely, rely on innuendo, and inaccurately and hurtfully label transgender women as “men,” at base they seem predicated on worry that someone born with different genitalia than you may see your genitalia or that you may see genitalia different than your own. As a matter of logistics and logic, these concerns are, to borrow from Justice Antonin Scalia, applesauce.

First, bathrooms—particularly women’s bathrooms—are designed to maintain personal privacy regardless of who is in the neighboring stall. Even in men’s restrooms there are stalls available for those especially worried about privacy. In other words, if you have a concern about who sees your genitalia, or if you prefer not to see anyone else’s, just use a stall and avoid the urinals. And in the locker room context, practical solutions such as a privacy curtain can be easily and affordably installed to provide greater privacy to anyone who desires it.
Second, to the extent there is concern over someone’s prurient interest, those supporting bathroom bans completely overlook issues of sexual orientation. Transgender people—like cisgender people—can be straight, gay, or bi. That’s to say, a straight transgender woman is probably as uninterested in another woman’s groin as any other straight woman.",2016-05-11 17:49:26+00:00,d31kqg6,8.0,t1_d31jins,1516.0,politics

[Gender exists on a spectrum](http://www.medicaldaily.com/challenging-gender-identity-biologists-say-gender-expands-across-spectrum-rather-323956), and while there are genderfluid, there are also binary trans people.

&gt; Isn't transgender a status that has been classified as a mental illness?

The DSM-IV-TR diagnostic component of distress is not inherent in the cross-gender identity; rather, it is related to social rejection and discrimination suffered by the individual. Psychology professor Darryl Hill insists that gender dysphoria is not a mental disorder, but rather that the diagnostic criteria reflect psychological distress in children that occurs when parents and others have trouble relating to their child's gender variance. 

&gt;Why this great push for transgendered people now? 

Because gay people cant be demonized anymore, so social conservatives had to find another target, trans people happen to be the one they picked.

What research has since shown is that the children who assert that they are the other gender actually are and are not likely to change. By over-including all gender non-conforming children, those numbers actually communicate nothing about the outcomes of trans kids, but that hasn’t stopped Zucker from using the study to motivate families into thinking such behavior is just a phase and can be corrected.

The proper protocol for gender variant children up to the age of 18 is to put them on observation for persistent, consistent, and insistent signs of gender dysphoria. To this endo, the suggested course of treatment for them is the administration of hormone blockcers to delay puberty. It is then up to the discretion of the endocrinologist whether or not to start cross hormone treatments, or to stop the blockers and let puberty proceed according to the gender they were assign at birth.

Here are a few studies done that address that.

Yes, some of them grow out of it, and for those that do, they can detransition, and/or stop the treatment of hormone blockers and puberty of the gender they were assigned at birth is allowed to proceed.

Evidence suggests that people who identify with a gender different from the one they were assigned at birth may do so not just due to psychological or behavioral causes, but also biological ones related to their genetics, the makeup of their brains, or prenatal exposure to hormones.

The DSM-IV-TR diagnostic component of distress is not inherent in the cross-gender identity; rather, it is related to social rejection and discrimination suffered by the individual. Psychology professor Darryl Hill insists that gender dysphoria is not a mental disorder, but rather that the diagnostic criteria reflect psychological distress in children that occurs when parents and others have trouble relating to their child's gender variance.

For example, genetic men with Klinefelter syndrome possess an extra X chromosome (XXY) or more rarely, two or three extra Xs (XXXY, XXXXY); they typically produce low levels of testosterone, leading to less-developed masculine sexual characteristics and more-developed feminine characteristics than other men. In contrast, some men receive an extra Y chromosome (XYY) in the genetic lottery, and while they have been referred to as “supermales” that is more sensationalism than science.

Genetic women with Turner syndrome have only one X chromosome; they often display less-developed female sexual characteristics than other women. And people with a genetic mosaic possess XX chromosomes in some cells and XY in others. So how do we determine if they’re male or female? Hint: Don’t say that it depends on the chromosomal makeup of the majority of their cells, since women with more than 90 per cent XY genetic material have given birth.

Even if you get the “right” combination of sex chromosomes, it’s no guarantee that you’ll fit into the carefully circumscribed human definitions of male and female.

For example, genetic women (XX) with congenital adrenal hyperplasia produced unusually high levels of virilizing hormones in utero and develop stereotypically masculine sexual characteristics, including masculinized genitals.

Similarly, genetic men (XY) with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome don’t respond to male hormones and fail to develop masculine sexual characteristics. Most live their lives as women. Some historians suggest that Joan of Arc, Elizabeth I and Wallis Simpson all suffered from this syndrome.

So what’s the answer? There isn’t one, at least if we’re looking for the answer in biology. We must not fall back on biology. Rather, we must always remember that it is we, not biology, who decide who counts as male or female. And it is we who must take responsibility for our decisions.",2016-05-07 17:30:05+00:00,d2wj0d6,5.0,t1_d2vfv4g,83343.0,ainbow

Yes, trans people can be straight, gay, or bi. However, at no point does the transgender status disappear. We live in a complex world where people have overlapping identities. To say transgender status doesn’t matter when it comes to identity in the same way sexual orientation does, is like saying breathing has nothing to do with keeping you alive while the heart does everything. You simply cannot separate the two.

4529,"Historically, we were indeed considered mentally ill. The DSM (used in the US) recently declassified us as a 'disorder', but the ICD (used in much of the rest of the world) continues to classify us as a paraphilic disorder (essentially, a fetish). It's worth pointing out, however, that the ICD didn't declassify homosexuality as a disorder until the 90s (in fact, they did so in the current version of the ICD), two decades after the DSM declassified it. It also classifies the vast majority of the population as sex disordered, since things like enjoying kinky sex are disordered by the ICD's standards. The current draft of the upcoming new ICD edition also declassifies us as mentally ill, following the DSM's example.

But I would say we are not disordered, for three primary reasons: one, we show some basis in fact for our identification; two, unlike true delusional or somatoform disorders (which seem the most obvious comparison), psychiatric medication does not affect our feelings; and three, unlike true delusional/somatoform disorders, allowing us to pursue our feelings is far from destructive and in fact has exceptionally well-demonstrated positive results.

As best we can tell, gender identity is at least partially determined by brain structure formed very early in fetal development. A few studies show patterns typical of our identified gender and not of our birth sex.

Moreover, transgenderism correlates strongly with endocrine conditions - if we look at people born with externally female bodies, those with PCOS (which raises testosterone) are much more likely to ultimately identify as men; those with CAIS (which makes their bodies incapable of responding to testosterone) almost never do, to the point that single cases merit publication in their own right. On top of that, digit ratio (a marker of prenatal testosterone exposure) displays markedly low T exposure on average in trans women and high T exposure in trans men.

There's even some experimental evidence that, when cis (=not trans) people are categorized contrary to their birth sex, they experience the same distress that trans people do. Under the assumption that gender is malleable to social expectations, David Reimer was raised as a girl after a botched circumcision. He found himself uncomfortable with the female role, displayed symptoms typical of what would be expected of a trans man (that's FTM, to be clear), and ultimately transitioned to living as a man as soon as he became aware of his status in his early teens. And on the flip side, an author named Norah Vincent spent a year living as a man for the purposes of writing a book. By the end of that time, she was so depressed she checked herself into a mental institution because she was worried she might harm herself.

Additionally, trans feelings simply don't respond to psychiatric medication designed to 'cure' them. No professional organization in the world - even those that do classify us as a mental illness for (I feel) mostly historical/political reasons - recommends just giving us SSRIs or the like and sending us away. Traditional therapies simply do not work.

Compare this with Body Dysmorphic Disorder, a disorder that could be seen as an analog to trans people. BDD sufferers fixate on a small (e.g., a mole) or nonexistent part of their bodies, which they believe makes them hideous and unlovable. Some seek out treatment to remove the offending part. But BDD, unlike trans people, responds well to both therapy and SSRIs and does not respond to their desired interventions.",2016-05-07 16:29:16+00:00,d2wgx4g,3.0,t1_d2w8as5,20788.0,atheism
4530,"People tend to define sex in a binary way — either wholly male or wholly female — based on physical appearance or by which sex chromosomes an individual carries. But while sex and gender may seem dichotomous, there are in reality many intermediates.

 Understanding this complexity is critical; misperceptions can affect the health and civil liberties of those who fall outside perceived societal norms. Society has categorical views on what should define sex and gender, but the biological reality is just not there to support that.

 

 

Even at the most basic physical level, there is a spectrum between male and female that often goes unrecognized and risks being obscured by stigma. 

A growing body of research is showing how biology influences gender expression, sexual orientation and gender identity — characteristics that can also fall outside of strict, socially defined categories. Toy-preference tests, a popular gauge of gender expression, have long shown that boys and girls will typically gravitate to toys that are stereotypically associated with their gender (cars and guns for boys, for instance, or plush toys for girls). While one might argue that this could be the by-product of a child’s environment — parental influence at play or an internalization of societal norms — Melissa Hines, a former UCLA researcher and current professor of psychology at the University of Cambridge, in England, has shown otherwise. In 2008, she demonstrated that monkeys showed the same sex-based toy preferences as humans — absent societal influence.

Sexual orientation (whether one tends to be attracted to men or women) has also been shown to have biological roots. Twin studies and genetic linkage studies have shown both hereditary patterns in homosexuality (attraction to one’s own sex), as well as genetic associations with specific parts of the genome. And while gender identity — the sense one has of oneself as being either male or female — has been harder to pinpoint from a biological standpoint, efforts to understand what role biology may play are ongoing.",2016-05-07 16:28:41+00:00,d2wgwfj,3.0,t1_d2wamne,12992.0,atheism

[Transgender: Evidence on the biological nature of gender identity](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/02/150213112317.htm)

**Genetics**  
The androgen receptor (AR), also known as NR3C4, is activated by the binding of testosterone or dihydrotestosterone, where it plays a critical role in the forming of primary and secondary male sex characteristics. Hare et al. found that male-to-female transsexuals were found to have longer repetitions of the gene, which reduced its effectiveness at binding testosterone.

A variant genotype for a gene called CYP17, which acts on the sex hormones pregnenolone and progesterone, has been found to be linked to female-to-male transsexualism but not MTF transsexualism. Most notably, the FTM subjects not only had the variant genotype more frequently, but had an allele distribution equivalent to male controls, unlike the female controls. The paper concluded that the loss of a female-specific CYP17 T -34C allele distribution pattern is associated with FtM transsexualism.

**Brain structure**  
In a first-of-its-kind study, Zhou et al. (1995) found that in a region of the brain called the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTc), a region known for sex and anxiety responses, MTF transsexuals have a female-normal size while FTM transsexuals have a male-normal size. While the transsexuals studied had taken hormones, this was accounted for by including non-transsexual male and female controls who, for a variety of medical reasons, had experienced hormone reversal. The controls still retained sizes typical for their gender. No relationship to sexual orientation was found.

In a follow-up study, Kruijver et al. (2000) looked at the number of neurons in BSTc instead of volumes. They found the same results as Zhou et al. (1995), but with even more dramatic differences. One MTF subject who had never gone on hormones was also included, and who matched up with the female neuron counts nonetheless.

In 2002, a follow-up study by Chung et al. found that significant sexual dimorphism (variation between sexes) in BSTc did not become established until adulthood. Chung et al. theorized that either changes in fetal hormone levels produce changes in BSTc synaptic density, neuronal activity, or neurochemical content which later lead to size and neuron count changes in BSTc, or that the size of BSTc is affected by the failure to generate a gender identity consistent with one's anatomic sex.

In a review of the evidence in 2006, Gooren confirms the earlier research as supporting the concept that transsexualism is a sexual differentiation disorder of the sex dimorphic brain. Dick Swaab (2004) concurs.

In 2008, a new region with properties similar to that of BSTc in regards to transsexualism was found by Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab: the interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH3), part of the hypothalamic uncinate nucleus. The same method of controlling for hormone usage was used as in Zhou et al. (1995) and Kruijver et al. (2000). The differences were even more pronounced than with BSTc; control males averaged 1.9 times the volume and 2.3 times the neurons as control females, yet once again, regardless of hormone exposure, MTF transsexuals lay within the female range and the FTM transsexual within the male range.

While the resolution of MRI tomographs in general can be fine enough, independent nuclei are not visible due to lack of contrast between different neurological tissue types. Therefore, such images do not show detailed structures such as BSTc and INAH3, and studies on BSTC were done by bisecting brains postmortem.

However, MRI does much more easily allow the study of larger brain structures. In Luders et al. (2009), 24 MTF transsexuals not-yet treated with cross-sex hormones were studied via MRI. While regional gray matter concentrations were more similar to men than women, there was a significantly larger volume of gray matter in the right putamen compared to men. As with many earlier studies, they concluded that transsexualism is associated with a distinct cerebral pattern.

An additional feature was studied in a group of FTM transsexuals who had not yet received cross-sex hormones: fractional anisotropy values for white matter in the medial and posterior parts of the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), the forceps minor, and the corticospinal tract. Rametti et al. (2010) discovered that, ""Compared to control females, FtM showed higher FA values in posterior part of the right SLF, the forceps minor and corticospinal tract. Compared to control males, FtM showed only lower FA values in the corticospinal tract.""

Hulshoff Pol et al. (2006), studied the gross brain volume of subjects undergoing hormone treatment. They discovered that whole brain volume for subjects changes toward the size of the opposite sex during hormone treatment. The conclusion of the study was, ""The findings suggest that, throughout life, gonadal hormones remain essential for maintaining aspects of sex-specific differences in the human brain.""

**Brain plasticity**  
Brain structure differences associated with transsexualism do not exist in isolation. Similar brain structure differences have been noted between gay and heterosexual men, and between lesbian and heterosexual women.

More recent studies have found that circumstance and repeated activities such as meditation modify brain structures in a process called brain plasticity or neuroplasticity. In May 2014, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reported that parenting ""rewires the male brain"" for fathers.

**Brain function**  
Phantom limb syndrome is a common, often painful experience after the loss of an external organ. Ramachandran (2008) found that while nearly two thirds of non-transsexual males who have a penis surgically removed experience the sensation of a phantom penis, only one third of MTF transsexuals do so after sex reassignment surgery. This study, however, overlooks the differences between an amputation, where the nerves connecting the penis and the brain are severed, and male-to-female gender reassignment surgery, where some of the penis and scrotum may be reused to create a vaginal canal, labia and a clitoris. In this case, some of the nerves connecting the new genitalia to the brain remain largely intact. Also, two-thirds of FTM transsexuals reported the sensation of a phantom penis from childhood onwards, complete with phantom erections and other phenomena.

Berglund et al. (2008) tested the response of gynephilic MTF transsexuals to two sex pheromones: the progestin-like 4,16-androstadien-3-one (AND) and the estrogen-like 1,3,5(10),16-tetraen-3-ol (EST). Despite the difference in sexuality, the MTFs' hypothalamic networks activated in response to AND, like the androphilic female control groups. Both groups experienced amygdala activation in response to EST. Male control groups (gynephilic) experienced hypothalamic activation in response to EST. However, the MTF subjects also experienced limited hypothalamic activation to EST as well. The researchers' conclusion was, that in terms of pheromone activation, MTF's occupy an intermediate position with predominantly female features.[17] The MTF transsexual subjects had not undergone any hormonal treatment at the time of the study, according to their own declaration beforehand, and confirmed by repeated tests of hormonal levels.

**Transsexuality among twins**  
In a 2013 study based on previously published research and conducted surveys it was found that in 39 coming from a single fertilized egg, monozygotic twin male pairs, 13 (33%) identified both of themselves as transsexual. This was found in 8 of 25 (22.5%) female pairs. Alternatively only 1 out of 38 (2.6%) coming from different fertilized eggs, dizygotic male and female pairs identified themselves as transsexual. The significant percentage of transsexual identification in both of the identical twins, and the virtual absence of this correspondence in dizygotic twins raised in the same family at the same time, supports the argument that one's transsexual identity is significantly influenced by genetics.

**Prenatal androgen exposure**  
Prenatal androgen exposure, the lack thereof, or poor sensitivity to prenatal androgens are commonly cited mechanisms to explain the above discoveries. Schneider, Pickel, and Stalla (2006) found a correlation between digit ratio (a generally accepted marker for prenatal androgen exposure) and male to female transsexualism. MTF transsexuals were found to have a higher digit ratio than control males, but one that was comparable to control females.",2016-05-07 10:43:13+00:00,d2w8azq,2.0,t1_d2w848q,785.0,atheism

[ Socially transitioned transgender children who are supported in their gender identity have developmentally normative levels of depression and only minimal elevations in anxiety, suggesting that psychopathology is not inevitable within this group. Especially striking is the comparison with reports of children with GID; socially transitioned transgender children have notably lower rates of internalizing psychopathology than previously reported among children with GID living as their natal sex.](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2016/02/24/peds.2015-3223)

4552,"Biology doesn’t work that way. Biological phenomena don’t necessarily fit into human-ordained binary categories. So while humans insist that you’re either male or female – that you have either XY or XX sex chromosomes – biology begs to differ.

For example, genetic men with Klinefelter syndrome possess an extra X chromosome (XXY) or more rarely, two or three extra Xs (XXXY, XXXXY); they typically produce low levels of testosterone, leading to less-developed masculine sexual characteristics and more-developed feminine characteristics than other men. In contrast, some men receive an extra Y chromosome (XYY) in the genetic lottery, and while they have been referred to as “supermales” that is more sensationalism than science.

Genetic women with Turner syndrome have only one X chromosome; they often display less-developed female sexual characteristics than other women. And people with a genetic mosaic possess XX chromosomes in some cells and XY in others. So how do we determine if they’re male or female? Hint: Don’t say that it depends on the chromosomal makeup of the majority of their cells, since women with more than 90 per cent XY genetic material have given birth.

Even if you get the “right” combination of sex chromosomes, it’s no guarantee that you’ll fit into the carefully circumscribed human definitions of male and female.

For example, genetic women (XX) with congenital adrenal hyperplasia produced unusually high levels of virilizing hormones in utero and develop stereotypically masculine sexual characteristics, including masculinized genitals.

Similarly, genetic men (XY) with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome don’t respond to male hormones and fail to develop masculine sexual characteristics. Most live their lives as women. Some historians suggest that Joan of Arc, Elizabeth I and Wallis Simpson all suffered from this syndrome.

So what’s the answer? There isn’t one, at least if we’re looking for the answer in biology. We must not fall back on biology. Rather, we must always remember that it is we, not biology, who decide who counts as male or female. And it is we who must take responsibility for our decisions.",2016-05-07 00:33:33+00:00,d2vug7p,1.0,t3_4i7oxp,3821.0,asktransgender

4592,"[A national survey](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22609017) found that 52% of OB-GYNs at Catholic hospitals have clashed with those committees over the proper course of care, including the treatment of ectopic pregnancy and the provision of birth control.

In contrast to standard, secular medical ethics, which put the woman first, Catholic hospitals abide by the ethical directives handed down by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops for use in medical care. And they generally treat the fetus as a separate patient with equal standing. In emergency care, this can mean waiting until fetal death happens on its own, even if it puts the woman at greater risk of infection.

Sending patients elsewhere isn’t always possible, especially in rural areas or in a true emergency. In 2009, a woman with heart failure who was 11 weeks pregnant and had a “close to 100 percent” risk of mortality arrived at a Catholic hospital in Phoenix. The situation was too dire for her to be moved, and a nun agreed that the termination the patient wanted was necessary. That nun, Sister Margaret McBride; was excommunicated.

In 2007, Dr. Ramesh Raghavan wrote in the Journal of American Medicine about a case where a woman 21 weeks pregnant with twins learned they were nonviable and uterine infection was inevitable. The woman and her husband requested induction of labor, but the hospital refused on religious grounds; they were able to transfer to another hospital, where she gave birth to two stillborns.

4612,"California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia all have such laws. Their protections vary. For example, Nevada’s law bans discrimination in employment, housing, and public accommodations like restaurants, hospitals, and retail stores; Maine’s law covers those categories plus access to credit and education.

At least 200 cities and counties have banned gender identity discrimination, including Atlanta, Austin, Boise, Buffalo, Cincinnati, Dallas, El Paso, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Louisville, Milwaukee, New Orleans, New York City, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, and San Antonio, as well as many smaller towns.

The governors of Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, New York, and Pennsylvania have issued executive orders banning discrimination against transgender state workers. Some cities and counties have also protected their transgender public employees through local ordinances, charter provisions, or other means. People discriminated against by public entities on the basis of gender identity might also be able to argue that the government’s action was unconstitutional.

Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex (among other characteristics) by an employer with 15 or more employees. 

A few federal courts have ruled that the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection under the law bars the government from discriminating against people based on their transgender status or gender transition. For example, a federal appeals court in 2011 ruled in favor of a transgender woman whose boss fired her from her state government job because he was uncomfortable with her gender transition. The court ruled that “discrimination against a transgender individual because of her gender nonconformity is sex discrimination, whether it’s described as being on the basis of sex or gender.”

[Transgender: Evidence on the biological nature of gender identity](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/02/150213112317.htm)

**Genetics**  
The androgen receptor (AR), also known as NR3C4, is activated by the binding of testosterone or dihydrotestosterone, where it plays a critical role in the forming of primary and secondary male sex characteristics. Hare et al. found that male-to-female transsexuals were found to have longer repetitions of the gene, which reduced its effectiveness at binding testosterone.

A variant genotype for a gene called CYP17, which acts on the sex hormones pregnenolone and progesterone, has been found to be linked to female-to-male transsexualism but not MTF transsexualism. Most notably, the FTM subjects not only had the variant genotype more frequently, but had an allele distribution equivalent to male controls, unlike the female controls. The paper concluded that the loss of a female-specific CYP17 T -34C allele distribution pattern is associated with FtM transsexualism.

**Brain structure**  
In a first-of-its-kind study, Zhou et al. (1995) found that in a region of the brain called the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTc), a region known for sex and anxiety responses, MTF transsexuals have a female-normal size while FTM transsexuals have a male-normal size. While the transsexuals studied had taken hormones, this was accounted for by including non-transsexual male and female controls who, for a variety of medical reasons, had experienced hormone reversal. The controls still retained sizes typical for their gender. No relationship to sexual orientation was found.

In a follow-up study, Kruijver et al. (2000) looked at the number of neurons in BSTc instead of volumes. They found the same results as Zhou et al. (1995), but with even more dramatic differences. One MTF subject who had never gone on hormones was also included, and who matched up with the female neuron counts nonetheless.

In 2002, a follow-up study by Chung et al. found that significant sexual dimorphism (variation between sexes) in BSTc did not become established until adulthood. Chung et al. theorized that either changes in fetal hormone levels produce changes in BSTc synaptic density, neuronal activity, or neurochemical content which later lead to size and neuron count changes in BSTc, or that the size of BSTc is affected by the failure to generate a gender identity consistent with one's anatomic sex.

In a review of the evidence in 2006, Gooren confirms the earlier research as supporting the concept that transsexualism is a sexual differentiation disorder of the sex dimorphic brain. Dick Swaab (2004) concurs.

In 2008, a new region with properties similar to that of BSTc in regards to transsexualism was found by Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab: the interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH3), part of the hypothalamic uncinate nucleus. The same method of controlling for hormone usage was used as in Zhou et al. (1995) and Kruijver et al. (2000). The differences were even more pronounced than with BSTc; control males averaged 1.9 times the volume and 2.3 times the neurons as control females, yet once again, regardless of hormone exposure, MTF transsexuals lay within the female range and the FTM transsexual within the male range.

While the resolution of MRI tomographs in general can be fine enough, independent nuclei are not visible due to lack of contrast between different neurological tissue types. Therefore, such images do not show detailed structures such as BSTc and INAH3, and studies on BSTC were done by bisecting brains postmortem.

However, MRI does much more easily allow the study of larger brain structures. In Luders et al. (2009), 24 MTF transsexuals not-yet treated with cross-sex hormones were studied via MRI. While regional gray matter concentrations were more similar to men than women, there was a significantly larger volume of gray matter in the right putamen compared to men. As with many earlier studies, they concluded that transsexualism is associated with a distinct cerebral pattern.

An additional feature was studied in a group of FTM transsexuals who had not yet received cross-sex hormones: fractional anisotropy values for white matter in the medial and posterior parts of the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), the forceps minor, and the corticospinal tract. Rametti et al. (2010) discovered that, ""Compared to control females, FtM showed higher FA values in posterior part of the right SLF, the forceps minor and corticospinal tract. Compared to control males, FtM showed only lower FA values in the corticospinal tract.""

Hulshoff Pol et al. (2006), studied the gross brain volume of subjects undergoing hormone treatment. They discovered that whole brain volume for subjects changes toward the size of the opposite sex during hormone treatment. The conclusion of the study was, ""The findings suggest that, throughout life, gonadal hormones remain essential for maintaining aspects of sex-specific differences in the human brain.""

**Brain plasticity**  
Brain structure differences associated with transsexualism do not exist in isolation. Similar brain structure differences have been noted between gay and heterosexual men, and between lesbian and heterosexual women.

More recent studies have found that circumstance and repeated activities such as meditation modify brain structures in a process called brain plasticity or neuroplasticity. In May 2014, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reported that parenting ""rewires the male brain"" for fathers.

**Brain function**  
Phantom limb syndrome is a common, often painful experience after the loss of an external organ. Ramachandran (2008) found that while nearly two thirds of non-transsexual males who have a penis surgically removed experience the sensation of a phantom penis, only one third of MTF transsexuals do so after sex reassignment surgery. This study, however, overlooks the differences between an amputation, where the nerves connecting the penis and the brain are severed, and male-to-female gender reassignment surgery, where some of the penis and scrotum may be reused to create a vaginal canal, labia and a clitoris. In this case, some of the nerves connecting the new genitalia to the brain remain largely intact. Also, two-thirds of FTM transsexuals reported the sensation of a phantom penis from childhood onwards, complete with phantom erections and other phenomena.

Berglund et al. (2008) tested the response of gynephilic MTF transsexuals to two sex pheromones: the progestin-like 4,16-androstadien-3-one (AND) and the estrogen-like 1,3,5(10),16-tetraen-3-ol (EST). Despite the difference in sexuality, the MTFs' hypothalamic networks activated in response to AND, like the androphilic female control groups. Both groups experienced amygdala activation in response to EST. Male control groups (gynephilic) experienced hypothalamic activation in response to EST. However, the MTF subjects also experienced limited hypothalamic activation to EST as well. The researchers' conclusion was, that in terms of pheromone activation, MTF's occupy an intermediate position with predominantly female features.[17] The MTF transsexual subjects had not undergone any hormonal treatment at the time of the study, according to their own declaration beforehand, and confirmed by repeated tests of hormonal levels.

**Transsexuality among twins**  
In a 2013 study based on previously published research and conducted surveys it was found that in 39 coming from a single fertilized egg, monozygotic twin male pairs, 13 (33%) identified both of themselves as transsexual. This was found in 8 of 25 (22.5%) female pairs. Alternatively only 1 out of 38 (2.6%) coming from different fertilized eggs, dizygotic male and female pairs identified themselves as transsexual. The significant percentage of transsexual identification in both of the identical twins, and the virtual absence of this correspondence in dizygotic twins raised in the same family at the same time, supports the argument that one's transsexual identity is significantly influenced by genetics.

**Prenatal androgen exposure**  
Prenatal androgen exposure, the lack thereof, or poor sensitivity to prenatal androgens are commonly cited mechanisms to explain the above discoveries. Schneider, Pickel, and Stalla (2006) found a correlation between digit ratio (a generally accepted marker for prenatal androgen exposure) and male to female transsexualism. MTF transsexuals were found to have a higher digit ratio than control males, but one that was comparable to control females.",2016-05-04 15:12:19+00:00,d2shxat,2.0,t1_d2rnvav,58848.0,Christianity

4690,"Biology doesn’t work that way. Biological phenomena don’t necessarily fit into human-ordained binary categories. So while humans insist that you’re either male or female – that you have either XY or XX sex chromosomes – biology begs to differ.

For example, genetic men with Klinefelter syndrome possess an extra X chromosome (XXY) or more rarely, two or three extra Xs (XXXY, XXXXY); they typically produce low levels of testosterone, leading to less-developed masculine sexual characteristics and more-developed feminine characteristics than other men. In contrast, some men receive an extra Y chromosome (XYY) in the genetic lottery, and while they have been referred to as “supermales” that is more sensationalism than science.

Genetic women with Turner syndrome have only one X chromosome; they often display less-developed female sexual characteristics than other women. And people with a genetic mosaic possess XX chromosomes in some cells and XY in others. So how do we determine if they’re male or female? Hint: Don’t say that it depends on the chromosomal makeup of the majority of their cells, since women with more than 90 per cent XY genetic material have given birth.

Even if you get the “right” combination of sex chromosomes, it’s no guarantee that you’ll fit into the carefully circumscribed human definitions of male and female.

For example, genetic women (XX) with congenital adrenal hyperplasia produced unusually high levels of virilizing hormones in utero and develop stereotypically masculine sexual characteristics, including masculinized genitals.

Similarly, genetic men (XY) with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome don’t respond to male hormones and fail to develop masculine sexual characteristics. Most live their lives as women. Some historians suggest that Joan of Arc, Elizabeth I and Wallis Simpson all suffered from this syndrome.

So what’s the answer? There isn’t one, at least if we’re looking for the answer in biology. We must not fall back on biology. Rather, we must always remember that it is we, not biology, who decide who counts as male or female. And it is we who must take responsibility for our decisions.

As for the fetus, well, regardless of whether a fetus is a human being or has rights, women will have abortions anyway, even if it means breaking the law or risking their lives. Even women who believe that abortion is murder have chosen to get abortions, and will continue to do so. That's why we should leave the decision up to women’s moral conscience, and make sure that they are provided with safe, legal, accessible abortions. Because ultimately, the status of a fetus is a matter of subjective opinion, and the only opinion that counts is that of the pregnant woman. For example, a happily pregnant woman may feel love for her fetus as a special and unique human being, a welcome and highly anticipated member of her family. She names her fetus, refers to it as a baby, talks to it, and so on. But an unhappily pregnant woman may view her fetus with utter dismay, bordering on revulsion. She cannot bring herself to refer to it as anything other than ""it,"" much less a human being. She is desperate to get rid of this unwelcome invader, and when she does, she feels tremendous relief. Both of these reactions to a fetus, and all reactions in between, are perfectly valid and natural. Both may even occur in the same woman, years apart.",2016-05-01 19:06:29+00:00,d2opchb,10.0,t1_d2ooyjy,601.0,politics

4783,"I'm not sure what point you're trying to make. The DSM-III has recommendations of treatment of gender dysphoria that no longer apply, which is why they were updated to the current version of DSM-V. And the diagnosis of gender dysphoria in children just means that the recommended course of treatment is social transition(if they are more comfortable), regular monitoring, and the administering of hormone blockers if and when deemed necessary. 

One of your studies has Zucker as the main author. Zucker has been an adamant proponent of the myth that 80 percent of kids with cross-gender identification will eventually turn out to just be gay, not transgender. The study that produced this conclusion, however, relied on conflating all gender non-conforming behavior with actually asserting a different gender identity. What research has since shown is that the children who assert that they are the other gender actually are and are not likely to change. By over-including all gender non-conforming children, those numbers actually communicate nothing about the outcomes of trans kids, but that hasn’t stopped Zucker from using the study to motivate families into thinking such behavior is just a phase and can be corrected.

Yes, some of them grow out of it, and for those that do, they can detransition, and/or stop the treatment of hormone blockers and puberty of the gender they were assigned at birth is allowed to proceed.

Well, you're at the age where you start difuring out what you like sexually. It's not wrong, it's perfectly normal.

&gt;Well, I smile a lot, talk a lot, cry or get emotional really fast- a lot. Guys, doesn't like that in a guy looking friend. In my fucked up culture, these are considered as very feminine, and there is a general idea that keeps forcing males to be very serious or something like that, and I'm the opposite.

Yeesh, do i even dare ask where you live? Cuz all the guys i've made friends with all around the globe are nothing like that.

[Heylans et al., 2014](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12363/abstract): ""A difference in SCL-90 [a test of distress, anxiety, and hostility] overall psychoneurotic distress was observed at the different points of assessments (P = 0.003), with the most prominent decrease occurring after the initiation of hormone therapy (P &lt; 0.001)...Furthermore, the SCL-90 scores resembled those of a general population after hormone therapy was initiated.""

[Colizzi et al., 2013](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12155/abstract): ""At enrollment, transsexuals reported elevated CAR ['cortisol awakening response', a physiological measure of stress]; their values were out of normal. They expressed higher perceived stress and more attachment insecurity, with respect to normative sample data. When treated with hormone therapy [at followup, 1 year after beginning HRT], transsexuals reported significantly lower CAR (P &lt; 0.001), falling within the normal range for cortisol levels. Treated transsexuals showed also lower perceived stress (P &lt; 0.001), with levels similar to normative samples.""

[Gomez-Gil et al., 2012](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21937168): ""SADS, HAD-A, and HAD-Depression (HAD-D) mean scores [these are tests of depression and anxiety] were significantly higher among patients who had not begun cross-sex hormonal treatment compared with patients in hormonal treatment (F=4.362, p=.038; F=14.589, p=.001; F=9.523, p=.002 respectively). Similarly, current symptoms of anxiety and depression were present in a significantly higher percentage of untreated patients than in treated patients (61% vs. 33% and 31% vs. 8% respectively).""

de Vries, et al., 2014 studied 55 trans teens from the onset of treatment in their early teenage years through a follow-up an average of 7 years later. They found no negative outcomes, no regrets, and in fact their group was slightly mentally healthier than non-trans controls.

[Lawrence, 2003](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1024086814364) surveyed post-op trans folk: ""Participants reported overwhelmingly that they were happy with their SRS results and that SRS had greatly improved the quality of their lives. None reported outright regret and only a few expressed even occasional regret.""

&gt;Some background, 16, MtF. Fetishing and masturbating to the thought of being a woman since alive! 

Yeah, many of us obsess over trans porn before we come out. Hell, even after we come out, some of us obsess about finding that daddy to dominate us. To which i would say..... so? more power to you, whatever gets you off. I used to fap to trans porn all the time til i came out and started transitioning. Turns out for me, it was just some twisted version of what i thought my life would be like as a trans girl. It took lots of therapy for me to see that (Thank you Dr Milrod.) *caveat:- ymmv

&gt;Have a female mind, characteristics... Maybe that's why I don't have any male friends. Like the hate between dogs and cats. They just don't like me, but I guess they would like me, If I was ""fully"" female.

Err... what does being female have to do with being friends with guys? I hang out with guys all the time, heck, my bestie is a guy. Maybe try widening your circle? Sometimes it helps to explore new avenues. (God i sound like a fortune cookie.)

&gt; If I got an erection from a relationship with a girl I really like/maybe loved, doesn't that mean that I'm not transsexual?

Dont confuse sexual orientation with gender identity. The first is who you go to sleep **WITH**, the latter is who you go to sleep **AS**. There are plenty of transbians out there.... like a whole bunch of them..... a whole bunch of really, REALLY cute ones too..... who are really fun to cuddle with..... but i digress

&gt; I remember the first time, finding this term ""Transsexual"", I was like, ""Fuck, this is what I am.."".

Congrats, many of us struggle with that for a really long time before we accept it, if we ever do. I had that same moment of realization when i was 7, but i fought it for the next 32 years before i came out. Denial, not just a river in Egypt.

&gt;I want to be fully sure to start finding solutions.

Then i suggest getting a gender therapist.

&gt;Besides, I still can't take my eyes away when I see a very beatiful girl.

Congrats, you're a lesbian.

&gt; To be honest, I don't think, that I would like to have sex with a girl. I'm the girl I guess, when it comes to ""bed"".

So you're a submissive, join the club, so am i. Well, technically i'm a switch, so if my partner wanted to, i could be dom for that session.

&gt;I really can't think about marrying a dude. 

Ok, so marry a girl, i did.

&gt;Maybe, all those thoughts that are imposed upon me by the capitalist world, and my idiotic culture caused this. 

Or maybe you're just another one of the many of us who is currently struggling to make sense out of this crazy world. That's just life, we figure out problems one at a time, enjoy the time we have, and try to find some happiness along the way.

&gt;As you can see, I can't identify my ""gender"" somehow. Let's assume that I am %100 transsexual, and will never be regretfull about transitioning.

Actually, it seems that you have figured out your gender. It also seems that you're scared about transitioning. It's ok, many of us are, it's a big step. But trust me, we're all here for you.

&gt; This is the second part, now is where everything gets fucked up. I guess I'm around 5'9"", 180-179 cm. That is not a female high

Ha! I got an inch on you, I'm 5'10"", and [i rock 5 inch heels all the time](http://i.imgur.com/NiFCuQM.jpg) 

&gt;I have wide shoulders relatively to my hips....

many girls obsess over their body, it's not healthy, and THAT we can blame the media for, with all the photoshopped images of impossible beauty.

&gt;What about voice? I've searcing and find no fucking usefull stuff for a female voice, is there a surgery for that? I bet it is expensive... 

You can achieve a female voice, all you need to do it [practice, practice, practice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO41CpUW7IM). [And there is a surgery for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3ND6ZUB6_Y). And yes, many of us are saving up for it.

&gt;I wish I was born a female. 

You, me, and a lot of other trans girls wish the same. It was not to be, we have to play with the cards we were dealth with.

&gt; We don't have the fucking money to do it. 

HRT really isnt all that expensive. I'm on estrogen injections, and they run me $40 for a 5 month supply. My progesterone is covered under insurance, and i cycle them, so only 10 pills a month,

&gt; laser hair removal...

So shave. Your hair gets less coarse on hrt.

&gt;Well, shit. Even if we have the money, I would never come out to my dad ..

Yeah, my parents reacted the same way. But i didnt really have a choice. It was either come out or kill myself. Sooooooo..... I'm still working on my parents, i'm hoping one day they'll come around, they're family after all.

&gt;What to do to get rid of these terrible dilemmas, that depression?

Transitioning with help, but it really depends on your situation. If you do it now, you'll have to depend on your dad to support you. If you push it, you have to wait til you can support yourself.  It's a tough choice, and it's not fair to make you choose at your age, but there it is.

&gt;Ending it all, would be a lot easier. That really seems like a logical option to me. Think, imagine, jumping from a 20 floor high building, instant death...

No, it's really not the answer. Trust me, i tried twice, it's not something you'd want to do. Please, at least try transitioning. Is there an LGBT center you can go to or call?

[Transgender: Evidence on the biological nature of gender identity](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/02/150213112317.htm)

**Genetics**  
The androgen receptor (AR), also known as NR3C4, is activated by the binding of testosterone or dihydrotestosterone, where it plays a critical role in the forming of primary and secondary male sex characteristics. Hare et al. found that male-to-female transsexuals were found to have longer repetitions of the gene, which reduced its effectiveness at binding testosterone.

A variant genotype for a gene called CYP17, which acts on the sex hormones pregnenolone and progesterone, has been found to be linked to female-to-male transsexualism but not MTF transsexualism. Most notably, the FTM subjects not only had the variant genotype more frequently, but had an allele distribution equivalent to male controls, unlike the female controls. The paper concluded that the loss of a female-specific CYP17 T -34C allele distribution pattern is associated with FtM transsexualism.

**Brain structure**  
In a first-of-its-kind study, Zhou et al. (1995) found that in a region of the brain called the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTc), a region known for sex and anxiety responses, MTF transsexuals have a female-normal size while FTM transsexuals have a male-normal size. While the transsexuals studied had taken hormones, this was accounted for by including non-transsexual male and female controls who, for a variety of medical reasons, had experienced hormone reversal. The controls still retained sizes typical for their gender. No relationship to sexual orientation was found.

In a follow-up study, Kruijver et al. (2000) looked at the number of neurons in BSTc instead of volumes. They found the same results as Zhou et al. (1995), but with even more dramatic differences. One MTF subject who had never gone on hormones was also included, and who matched up with the female neuron counts nonetheless.

In 2002, a follow-up study by Chung et al. found that significant sexual dimorphism (variation between sexes) in BSTc did not become established until adulthood. Chung et al. theorized that either changes in fetal hormone levels produce changes in BSTc synaptic density, neuronal activity, or neurochemical content which later lead to size and neuron count changes in BSTc, or that the size of BSTc is affected by the failure to generate a gender identity consistent with one's anatomic sex.

In a review of the evidence in 2006, Gooren confirms the earlier research as supporting the concept that transsexualism is a sexual differentiation disorder of the sex dimorphic brain. Dick Swaab (2004) concurs.

In 2008, a new region with properties similar to that of BSTc in regards to transsexualism was found by Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab: the interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH3), part of the hypothalamic uncinate nucleus. The same method of controlling for hormone usage was used as in Zhou et al. (1995) and Kruijver et al. (2000). The differences were even more pronounced than with BSTc; control males averaged 1.9 times the volume and 2.3 times the neurons as control females, yet once again, regardless of hormone exposure, MTF transsexuals lay within the female range and the FTM transsexual within the male range.

While the resolution of MRI tomographs in general can be fine enough, independent nuclei are not visible due to lack of contrast between different neurological tissue types. Therefore, such images do not show detailed structures such as BSTc and INAH3, and studies on BSTC were done by bisecting brains postmortem.

However, MRI does much more easily allow the study of larger brain structures. In Luders et al. (2009), 24 MTF transsexuals not-yet treated with cross-sex hormones were studied via MRI. While regional gray matter concentrations were more similar to men than women, there was a significantly larger volume of gray matter in the right putamen compared to men. As with many earlier studies, they concluded that transsexualism is associated with a distinct cerebral pattern.

An additional feature was studied in a group of FTM transsexuals who had not yet received cross-sex hormones: fractional anisotropy values for white matter in the medial and posterior parts of the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), the forceps minor, and the corticospinal tract. Rametti et al. (2010) discovered that, ""Compared to control females, FtM showed higher FA values in posterior part of the right SLF, the forceps minor and corticospinal tract. Compared to control males, FtM showed only lower FA values in the corticospinal tract.""

Hulshoff Pol et al. (2006), studied the gross brain volume of subjects undergoing hormone treatment. They discovered that whole brain volume for subjects changes toward the size of the opposite sex during hormone treatment. The conclusion of the study was, ""The findings suggest that, throughout life, gonadal hormones remain essential for maintaining aspects of sex-specific differences in the human brain.""

**Brain plasticity**  
Brain structure differences associated with transsexualism do not exist in isolation. Similar brain structure differences have been noted between gay and heterosexual men, and between lesbian and heterosexual women.

More recent studies have found that circumstance and repeated activities such as meditation modify brain structures in a process called brain plasticity or neuroplasticity. In May 2014, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reported that parenting ""rewires the male brain"" for fathers.

**Brain function**  
Phantom limb syndrome is a common, often painful experience after the loss of an external organ. Ramachandran (2008) found that while nearly two thirds of non-transsexual males who have a penis surgically removed experience the sensation of a phantom penis, only one third of MTF transsexuals do so after sex reassignment surgery. This study, however, overlooks the differences between an amputation, where the nerves connecting the penis and the brain are severed, and male-to-female gender reassignment surgery, where some of the penis and scrotum may be reused to create a vaginal canal, labia and a clitoris. In this case, some of the nerves connecting the new genitalia to the brain remain largely intact. Also, two-thirds of FTM transsexuals reported the sensation of a phantom penis from childhood onwards, complete with phantom erections and other phenomena.

Berglund et al. (2008) tested the response of gynephilic MTF transsexuals to two sex pheromones: the progestin-like 4,16-androstadien-3-one (AND) and the estrogen-like 1,3,5(10),16-tetraen-3-ol (EST). Despite the difference in sexuality, the MTFs' hypothalamic networks activated in response to AND, like the androphilic female control groups. Both groups experienced amygdala activation in response to EST. Male control groups (gynephilic) experienced hypothalamic activation in response to EST. However, the MTF subjects also experienced limited hypothalamic activation to EST as well. The researchers' conclusion was, that in terms of pheromone activation, MTF's occupy an intermediate position with predominantly female features.[17] The MTF transsexual subjects had not undergone any hormonal treatment at the time of the study, according to their own declaration beforehand, and confirmed by repeated tests of hormonal levels.

**Transsexuality among twins**  
In a 2013 study based on previously published research and conducted surveys it was found that in 39 coming from a single fertilized egg, monozygotic twin male pairs, 13 (33%) identified both of themselves as transsexual. This was found in 8 of 25 (22.5%) female pairs. Alternatively only 1 out of 38 (2.6%) coming from different fertilized eggs, dizygotic male and female pairs identified themselves as transsexual. The significant percentage of transsexual identification in both of the identical twins, and the virtual absence of this correspondence in dizygotic twins raised in the same family at the same time, supports the argument that one's transsexual identity is significantly influenced by genetics.

**Prenatal androgen exposure**  
Prenatal androgen exposure, the lack thereof, or poor sensitivity to prenatal androgens are commonly cited mechanisms to explain the above discoveries. Schneider, Pickel, and Stalla (2006) found a correlation between digit ratio (a generally accepted marker for prenatal androgen exposure) and male to female transsexualism. MTF transsexuals were found to have a higher digit ratio than control males, but one that was comparable to control females.",2016-04-25 20:15:05+00:00,d2gzr9c,10.0,t1_d2gzcqe,513.0,politics

4869,"Biology doesn’t work that way. Biological phenomena don’t necessarily fit into human-ordained binary categories. So while humans insist that you’re either male or female – that you have either XY or XX sex chromosomes – biology begs to differ.

For example, genetic men with Klinefelter syndrome possess an extra X chromosome (XXY) or more rarely, two or three extra Xs (XXXY, XXXXY); they typically produce low levels of testosterone, leading to less-developed masculine sexual characteristics and more-developed feminine characteristics than other men. In contrast, some men receive an extra Y chromosome (XYY) in the genetic lottery, and while they have been referred to as “supermales” that is more sensationalism than science.

Genetic women with Turner syndrome have only one X chromosome; they often display less-developed female sexual characteristics than other women. And people with a genetic mosaic possess XX chromosomes in some cells and XY in others. So how do we determine if they’re male or female? Hint: Don’t say that it depends on the chromosomal makeup of the majority of their cells, since women with more than 90 per cent XY genetic material have given birth.

Even if you get the “right” combination of sex chromosomes, it’s no guarantee that you’ll fit into the carefully circumscribed human definitions of male and female.

For example, genetic women (XX) with congenital adrenal hyperplasia produced unusually high levels of virilizing hormones in utero and develop stereotypically masculine sexual characteristics, including masculinized genitals.

Similarly, genetic men (XY) with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome don’t respond to male hormones and fail to develop masculine sexual characteristics. Most live their lives as women. Some historians suggest that Joan of Arc, Elizabeth I and Wallis Simpson all suffered from this syndrome.

So what’s the answer? There isn’t one, at least if we’re looking for the answer in biology. We must not fall back on biology. Rather, we must always remember that it is we, not biology, who decide who counts as male or female.

4879,"I would say we are not disordered, for three primary reasons: one, we show some basis in fact for our identification; two, unlike true delusional or somatoform disorders (which seem the most obvious comparison), psychiatric medication does not affect our feelings; and three, unlike true delusional/somatoform disorders, allowing us to pursue our feelings is far from destructive and in fact has exceptionally well-demonstrated positive results.

As best we can tell, gender identity is at least partially determined by brain structure formed very early in fetal development. A few studies show patterns typical of our identified gender and not of our birth sex.

Moreover, transgenderism correlates strongly with endocrine conditions - if we look at people born with externally female bodies, those with PCOS (which raises testosterone) are much more likely to ultimately identify as men; those with CAIS (which makes their bodies incapable of responding to testosterone) almost never do, to the point that single cases merit publication in their own right. On top of that, digit ratio (a marker of prenatal testosterone exposure) displays markedly low T exposure on average in trans women and high T exposure in trans men.

There's even some experimental evidence that, when cis (=not trans) people are categorized contrary to their birth sex, they experience the same distress that trans people do. Under the assumption that gender is malleable to social expectations, David Reimer was raised as a girl after a botched circumcision. He found himself uncomfortable with the female role, displayed symptoms typical of what would be expected of a trans man (that's FTM, to be clear), and ultimately transitioned to living as a man as soon as he became aware of his status in his early teens. And on the flip side, an author named Norah Vincent spent a year living as a man for the purposes of writing a book. By the end of that time, she was so depressed she checked herself into a mental institution because she was worried she might harm herself.

Additionally, trans feelings simply don't respond to psychiatric medication designed to 'cure' them. No professional organization in the world - even those that do classify us as a mental illness for (I feel) mostly historical/political reasons - recommends just giving us SSRIs or the like and sending us away. Traditional therapies simply do not work.

Compare this with Body Dysmorphic Disorder, a disorder that could be seen as an analog to trans people. BDD sufferers fixate on a small (e.g., a mole) or nonexistent part of their bodies, which they believe makes them hideous and unlovable. Some seek out treatment to remove the offending part. But BDD, unlike trans people, responds well to both therapy and SSRIs and does not respond to their desired interventions.",2016-04-23 21:25:31+00:00,d2eoa24,2.0,t1_d2enj0r,1325.0,politics

Science disagrees with you. Gender dysphoria or gender identity disorder (GID) is the formal diagnosis used by psychologists and physicians to describe people who experience significant dysphoria (distress) with the sex and gender they were assigned at birth. Evidence suggests that people who identify with a gender different from the one they were assigned at birth may do so not just due to psychological or behavioral causes, but also biological ones related to their genetics, the makeup of their brains, or prenatal exposure to hormones.

The DSM-IV-TR diagnostic component of distress is not inherent in the cross-gender identity; rather, it is related to social rejection and discrimination suffered by the individual. Psychology professor Darryl Hill insists that gender dysphoria is not a mental disorder, but rather that the diagnostic criteria reflect psychological distress in children that occurs when parents and others have trouble relating to their child's gender variance. Transgender people have often been harassed, socially excluded, and subjected to discrimination, abuse and violence, including murder.

4910,"Biology doesn’t work that way. Biological phenomena don’t necessarily fit into human-ordained binary categories. So while humans insist that you’re either male or female – that you have either XY or XX sex chromosomes – biology begs to differ.

For example, genetic men with Klinefelter syndrome possess an extra X chromosome (XXY) or more rarely, two or three extra Xs (XXXY, XXXXY); they typically produce low levels of testosterone, leading to less-developed masculine sexual characteristics and more-developed feminine characteristics than other men. In contrast, some men receive an extra Y chromosome (XYY) in the genetic lottery, and while they have been referred to as “supermales” that is more sensationalism than science.

Genetic women with Turner syndrome have only one X chromosome; they often display less-developed female sexual characteristics than other women. And people with a genetic mosaic possess XX chromosomes in some cells and XY in others. So how do we determine if they’re male or female? Hint: Don’t say that it depends on the chromosomal makeup of the majority of their cells, since women with more than 90 per cent XY genetic material have given birth.

Even if you get the “right” combination of sex chromosomes, it’s no guarantee that you’ll fit into the carefully circumscribed human definitions of male and female.

For example, genetic women (XX) with congenital adrenal hyperplasia produced unusually high levels of virilizing hormones in utero and develop stereotypically masculine sexual characteristics, including masculinized genitals.

Similarly, genetic men (XY) with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome don’t respond to male hormones and fail to develop masculine sexual characteristics. Most live their lives as women. Some historians suggest that Joan of Arc, Elizabeth I and Wallis Simpson all suffered from this syndrome.

So what’s the answer? There isn’t one, at least if we’re looking for the answer in biology. We must not fall back on biology. Rather, we must always remember that it is we, not biology, who decide who counts as male or female. And it is we who must take responsibility for our decisions.",2016-04-21 21:16:55+00:00,d2c8bk3,6.0,t1_d2c8abg,49.0,politics

White women also emphasized that contact with black women in bathrooms would infect them with venereal diseases. White women refused to share bathrooms with black women throughout the South. People even claimed that racial integration with blacks would cause them to catch syphilis from shared toilet seats and towels in public restrooms. Conflicts over bathrooms were rooted in beliefs about the vulnerability of southern womanhood to blackness, which by its mere presence had the power to contaminate, symbolizing a sexual threat regardless of gender.

5099,"I came out to my inner circle first, because without them, i dont know if i could have done it. And i told a few others after that, just to practice coming out. I blasted it out on facebook because i didnt want to give myself an escape route. There was no hiding after that. And the response i got was overwhelming, i lost one or two friends, but then, they werent really friends if they couldnt accept it. The rest of my friends made me cry, they were SO supportive and nice.

I'm a lot calmer now, it's probably a combination of hormones and the fact that i dont have to hide anymore. I'm not angry all the time either. Before i came out, i was an asshole, a real chauvinistic pig. All my girlfriends took great pleasure in repating all the mean things i had said about women over the years, and i totally deserved that.

As for second puberty?? Oy, where do i start. My emotions were all over the place. There was once where i had to pull over and cry, for no reason at all. I think i went thru about a three month PMS. it was NOT fun.

And shopping? Holyshitballs, the first time out for me was fucking stressful. I had to get my girlfriends to grab a few items, and sneak them into the changing room. 

Here's a weird thing tho, i know with my voice, i stopped resonating, but i thought i had to practice to get a higher pitch, so i was shocked when i started getting ""ma'am'ed"" over the phone. It still makes me smile whenever somebody says that. It's th eli'l things. ;-)

 There were all these questions running thru my head. 

Will i be pretty?  
If i'm not pretty, can i at least be passable?  
What if all my friends stop being my friends?  
What are my parents going to say?

And about a million other questions all buzzing around in my head at once. But the whole reason i blasted it out on facebook was to make sure that i couldnt go back. That bridge was burned, and i couldnt go back into the closet again because everyone knew.

Those thoughts lasted till my first shot of estrogen six months later. I drew it out for as long as i could, i had the script in my hands for two months before i made an appointment with the endo. But after that first shot? That was another bridge burned, and it was for real, there was no going backsies. And it was like a weight had been removed, just like when i first came out. I knew it was the right thing for me.

I think i've always known, and my subconscious wouldnt let me go back, the girl would not be denied.

Your mileage may vary, of course.

But I've known since I was 7 years old, but I also knew what the people around me thought about queer people, so I buried those feelings so deep into the closet that I was muff diving in Narnia. So over the years i let the girl out when nobody else was home, and i was happy, and it was enough, until it wasnt. And i'll skip over the substance abuse, the failed marriage, and the suicide attempts. 

And then I came out and everything changed. I felt better on female hormones, I liked the way I look, I liked that I could wear all the cute things. I could think straight, and i wasnt fighting to keep a secret, i could just relax and be me, i didnt have to pretend to be a boy anymore.

All my girlfriends knew I was hiding something, so did the ex-wife. And when you're that intimate with someone, they KNOW when you're hiding something. And hiding something as big as ""Hey I'm trans!"" takes an enormous toll on any relationship. They all thought I was gay, so when I came out, they all told me that it made WAY more sense to them now.

5124,"People tend to define sex in a binary way — either wholly male or wholly female — based on physical appearance or by which sex chromosomes an individual carries. But while sex and gender may seem dichotomous, there are in reality many intermediates.

 Understanding this complexity is critical; misperceptions can affect the health and civil liberties of those who fall outside perceived societal norms. Society has categorical views on what should define sex and gender, but the biological reality is just not there to support that.

 

 

Even at the most basic physical level, there is a spectrum between male and female that often goes unrecognized and risks being obscured by stigma. 

A growing body of research is showing how biology influences gender expression, sexual orientation and gender identity — characteristics that can also fall outside of strict, socially defined categories. Toy-preference tests, a popular gauge of gender expression, have long shown that boys and girls will typically gravitate to toys that are stereotypically associated with their gender (cars and guns for boys, for instance, or plush toys for girls). While one might argue that this could be the by-product of a child’s environment — parental influence at play or an internalization of societal norms — Melissa Hines, a former UCLA researcher and current professor of psychology at the University of Cambridge, in England, has shown otherwise. In 2008, she demonstrated that monkeys showed the same sex-based toy preferences as humans — absent societal influence.

Sexual orientation (whether one tends to be attracted to men or women) has also been shown to have biological roots. Twin studies and genetic linkage studies have shown both hereditary patterns in homosexuality (attraction to one’s own sex), as well as genetic associations with specific parts of the genome. And while gender identity — the sense one has of oneself as being either male or female — has been harder to pinpoint from a biological standpoint, efforts to understand what role biology may play are ongoing.",2016-04-09 15:57:27+00:00,d1w8izq,6.0,t1_d1w6fqu,3855.0,AskReddit

5135,"Biology doesn’t work that way. Biological phenomena don’t necessarily fit into human-ordained binary categories. So while humans insist that you’re either male or female – that you have either XY or XX sex chromosomes – biology begs to differ.

For example, genetic men with Klinefelter syndrome possess an extra X chromosome (XXY) or more rarely, two or three extra Xs (XXXY, XXXXY); they typically produce low levels of testosterone, leading to less-developed masculine sexual characteristics and more-developed feminine characteristics than other men. In contrast, some men receive an extra Y chromosome (XYY) in the genetic lottery, and while they have been referred to as “supermales” that is more sensationalism than science.

Genetic women with Turner syndrome have only one X chromosome; they often display less-developed female sexual characteristics than other women. And people with a genetic mosaic possess XX chromosomes in some cells and XY in others. So how do we determine if they’re male or female? Hint: Don’t say that it depends on the chromosomal makeup of the majority of their cells, since women with more than 90 per cent XY genetic material have given birth.

Even if you get the “right” combination of sex chromosomes, it’s no guarantee that you’ll fit into the carefully circumscribed human definitions of male and female.

For example, genetic women (XX) with congenital adrenal hyperplasia produced unusually high levels of virilizing hormones in utero and develop stereotypically masculine sexual characteristics, including masculinized genitals.

Similarly, genetic men (XY) with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome don’t respond to male hormones and fail to develop masculine sexual characteristics. Most live their lives as women. Some historians suggest that Joan of Arc, Elizabeth I and Wallis Simpson all suffered from this syndrome.

1) best time you can come out is before puberty, the second best time to come out is when you did it ;-)

2) stop beating yourself up, there is nothing wrong with you. It is what it is.

3) keep seeing that gender therapist.  some might dismiss it, but my therapist kept me sane when i was hanging on to sanity with my fingernails.

4) you cant change the past, focus in the future

5) breathe, it's overwhelming when you first come out, breathe, it's ok, it's normal, you just made a major life decision, you're supposed to be overwhelmed. take a deep breath, it will pass.

6) parents? oy. my bible thumper parents busted out the x-men line, ""have you tried NOT being trans."" It didnt change how i felt about the fam fam, i will try to their dying day to change their minds, because they are family.

7) buckle up, it gets even crazier. whatever you THINK it is going to be, there is no way you can prepare for what's coming. I just gave up and rode the wave of crazy till it passed. (oh the stories i could tell)

&gt;But I can't go back.

5157,"well, let's break that BS down, shall we? Biology doesn’t work that way. Biological phenomena don’t necessarily fit into human-ordained binary categories. So while humans insist that you’re either male or female – that you have either XY or XX sex chromosomes – biology begs to differ.

For example, genetic men with Klinefelter syndrome possess an extra X chromosome (XXY) or more rarely, two or three extra Xs (XXXY, XXXXY); they typically produce low levels of testosterone, leading to less-developed masculine sexual characteristics and more-developed feminine characteristics than other men. In contrast, some men receive an extra Y chromosome (XYY) in the genetic lottery, and while they have been referred to as “supermales” that is more sensationalism than science.

Genetic women with Turner syndrome have only one X chromosome; they often display less-developed female sexual characteristics than other women. And people with a genetic mosaic possess XX chromosomes in some cells and XY in others. So how do we determine if they’re male or female? Hint: Don’t say that it depends on the chromosomal makeup of the majority of their cells, since women with more than 90 per cent XY genetic material have given birth.

Even if you get the “right” combination of sex chromosomes, it’s no guarantee that you’ll fit into the carefully circumscribed human definitions of male and female.

For example, genetic women (XX) with congenital adrenal hyperplasia produced unusually high levels of virilizing hormones in utero and develop stereotypically masculine sexual characteristics, including masculinized genitals.

Similarly, genetic men (XY) with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome don’t respond to male hormones and fail to develop masculine sexual characteristics. Most live their lives as women. Some historians suggest that Joan of Arc, Elizabeth I and Wallis Simpson all suffered from this syndrome.",2016-04-08 22:08:57+00:00,d1vi5fs,3.0,t1_d1v608l,16644.0,asktransgender

[Journal Article](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.5b05088)

Please read at least the journal article's abstract before drawing any conclusions from the news source. News often misses important or interesting points and to really understand what the researchers were getting at it's important to understand the journal article.

Abstract:
&gt;Avoiding food loss and waste may counteract the increasing food demand and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the agricultural sector. This is crucial because of limited options available to increase food production. In the year 2010, food availability was 20% higher than was required on a global scale. Thus, a more sustainable food production and adjusted consumption would have positive environmental effects. This study provides a systematic approach to estimate consumer level food waste on a country scale and globally, based on food availability and requirements. The food requirement estimation considers demographic development, body weights, and physical activity levels. Surplus between food availability and requirements of a given country is considered as food waste. The global food requirement changed from 2,300 kcal/cap/day to 2,400 kcal/cap/day during the last 50 years, while food surplus grew from 310 kcal/cap/day to 510 kcal/cap/day. Similarly, GHG emissions related to the food surplus increased from 130 Mt CO2eq/yr to 530 Mt CO2eq/yr, an increase of more than 300%. Moreover, the global food surplus may increase up to 850 kcal/cap/day, while the total food requirement will increase only by 2%–20% by 2050. Consequently, GHG emissions associated with the food waste may also increase tremendously to 1.9–2.5 Gt CO2eq/yr.",2016-04-08 21:05:38+00:00,d1vfn1c,1.0,t3_4dw47t,31570.0,science

5209,"No it is NOT an argument about when life begins. That is an OPINION, and on that, we may differ. The majority of  fetuses cannot survive outside the womb until the third trimester, so until then, the decision of what to do with said fetus lies solely with the mother. 

If you believe that life begins at conception, good for you, take the baby to term. If however, you dont believe it, and circumstances dictate that it would better for you to end the pregnancy, then good for you too. That's choice.

And everyone does NOT lose, all the violence has been perpetrated by the anti-abortion people. Anti-abortion extremists are considered a current domestic terrorist threat by the US Department of Justice. Most documented incidents have occurred in the United States, though it has also occurred in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. G. Davidson Smith of Canadian Security Intelligence Service defined anti-abortion violence as ""single issue terrorism"". A study of 1982–87 violence considered the incidents ""limited political"" or ""subrevolutionary"" terrorism.
At least eleven murders occurred in the United States since 1990, as well as 41 bombings and 173 arsons at clinics since 1977. At least one murder occurred in Australia, as well several attempted murders in Canada. There were 1,793 abortion providers in the United States in 2008, as well as 197 abortion providers in Canada in 2001. The National Abortion Federation reported between 1,356 and 13,415 incidents of picketing at United States providers each year from 1995 to 2014.

5234,"yeah, i said those things too. finally had to do it at 39, didnt really have a choice. therapy + hrt + lots of support has made me a lot happier. 

&gt; I don't accept that I am female, since I am anatomically male and have had male socialisation.

A girl's a girl, no matter how she grew up. All that male socialization left its mark, that's for sure. Even tho my presentation is decidedly high femme, mentally, i'm definitely genderqueer AF, neither male, nor female, but somewhere inbetweeny. And i think that's great.

&gt;I consider this to be a mental handicap/illness, and that I should better find ways to manage it within my male body. I hope that science will, within my lifetime, be able to fix this from the mental side, rather than needing to alter the body. Or, you know, there's always Oculus Rift.

They've tried to change the mind to fit the body, it doesnt work. The head, and heart, know what they are. 

&gt;I have built a protective web of low-level addictions, such as pornography, alcohol, caffeine, that mitigates the effect of dysphoria. If I gave them all up, I might have more desire to transition. But for that reason, I can never find the willingness to give them up.

Oh god, the porn. I could tell you stories of the marathon fap session i would engage in, with lots of drugs and alcohol. That need went away on hrt for me. 

&gt;I think life would be objectively worse trying to be a non-passing transperson in a large city. I am used to people responding well to me. I would hate for that to change; daily life from the Post Office queue to the bus into town would become hellish and unbearable.
I have no desire to attract the attention of men, which I might as visibly trans.

aaaaaaaaaaaand even if you DO pass, you get hassled by guys. that's the price you pay for giving up male privilege. You're damned if you do and damned if you dont, but all things being equal, i know i'm a girl.

&gt;I have no desire to give up my male strength.

honestly, it's not that bad

&gt;I have more chance of finding a female partner as a handsome male with a feminine side, than as a terrible-looking female.
I have no qualms about seeing fetish escorts or getting my sexual kicks online, so I can still have 'transex' whenever I like. I don't want to give up my male libido.

yeeesh, going by my facebook feed, all my trans lesbians are having the time of their lives with their partners. I've got a wife and girlfriend, and i'm as happy as a clam.

&gt;Transition feels like it would be trying to create a false me - fake voice, fake mannerisms - and actually would take me further away from the truth, which is that this combination of male and female is the real and genuine me.

Well, the voice you do have to work on, the mannerisms?? just be you, it's amazing what happens when you dont have to pretend to be a boy anymore.

&gt;I regret not being fully male, as much as not being female. I have equal regret at not being either gender.

why not? I mod /r/genderqueer, and there are plenty of us who exist between the binary, and we do fine.

Look, it sounds like you need to talk to a therapist, would you at least try to make an appointment and bring this up with them? If nothing else, you get to unload this to another person face to face, and you'd be surprised at how cathartic it can be.

At least eleven murders occurred in the United States since 1990, as well as 41 bombings and 173 arsons at clinics since 1977. At least one murder occurred in Australia, as well several attempted murders in Canada. There were 1,793 abortion providers in the United States in 2008, as well as 197 abortion providers in Canada in 2001. The National Abortion Federation reported between 1,356 and 13,415 incidents of picketing at United States providers each year from 1995 to 2014.",2016-04-03 20:03:18+00:00,d1offsq,30.0,t1_d1ofdy8,79.0,politics

5313,"People tend to define sex in a binary way — either wholly male or wholly female — based on physical appearance or by which sex chromosomes an individual carries. But while sex and gender may seem dichotomous, there are in reality many intermediates.

 Understanding this complexity is critical; misperceptions can affect the health and civil liberties of those who fall outside perceived societal norms. Society has categorical views on what should define sex and gender, but the biological reality is just not there to support that.

 

 

Even at the most basic physical level, there is a spectrum between male and female that often goes unrecognized and risks being obscured by stigma. 

A growing body of research is showing how biology influences gender expression, sexual orientation and gender identity — characteristics that can also fall outside of strict, socially defined categories. Toy-preference tests, a popular gauge of gender expression, have long shown that boys and girls will typically gravitate to toys that are stereotypically associated with their gender (cars and guns for boys, for instance, or plush toys for girls). While one might argue that this could be the by-product of a child’s environment — parental influence at play or an internalization of societal norms — Melissa Hines, a former UCLA researcher and current professor of psychology at the University of Cambridge, in England, has shown otherwise. In 2008, she demonstrated that monkeys showed the same sex-based toy preferences as humans — absent societal influence.",2016-03-29 22:58:37+00:00,d1icbxd,12.0,t1_d1ibike,1198.0,politics
5314,"oh, you're one of THOSE bigots. i see.

Well, let's break that bullshit down, shall we?

Biology doesn’t work that way. Biological phenomena don’t necessarily fit into human-ordained binary categories. So while humans insist that you’re either male or female – that you have either XY or XX sex chromosomes – biology begs to differ.

For example, genetic men with Klinefelter syndrome possess an extra X chromosome (XXY) or more rarely, two or three extra Xs (XXXY, XXXXY); they typically produce low levels of testosterone, leading to less-developed masculine sexual characteristics and more-developed feminine characteristics than other men. In contrast, some men receive an extra Y chromosome (XYY) in the genetic lottery, and while they have been referred to as “supermales” that is more sensationalism than science.

Genetic women with Turner syndrome have only one X chromosome; they often display less-developed female sexual characteristics than other women. And people with a genetic mosaic possess XX chromosomes in some cells and XY in others. So how do we determine if they’re male or female? Hint: Don’t say that it depends on the chromosomal makeup of the majority of their cells, since women with more than 90 per cent XY genetic material have given birth.

Even if you get the “right” combination of sex chromosomes, it’s no guarantee that you’ll fit into the carefully circumscribed human definitions of male and female.

For example, genetic women (XX) with congenital adrenal hyperplasia produced unusually high levels of virilizing hormones in utero and develop stereotypically masculine sexual characteristics, including masculinized genitals.

Similarly, genetic men (XY) with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome don’t respond to male hormones and fail to develop masculine sexual characteristics. Most live their lives as women. Some historians suggest that Joan of Arc, Elizabeth I and Wallis Simpson all suffered from this syndrome.

So what’s the answer? There isn’t one, at least if we’re looking for the answer in biology. We must not fall back on biology. Rather, we must always remember that it is we, not biology, who decide who counts as male or female. And it is we who must take responsibility for our decisions.",2016-03-29 22:35:55+00:00,d1ibeio,10.0,t1_d1iallh,1161.0,politics

**American Medical Association**  
Resolution: Removing Financial Barriers to Care for Transgender Patients (2008)  
An established body of medical research demonstrates the effectiveness and medical necessity of mental health care, hormone therapy and sex reassignment surgery as forms of therapeutic treatment for many people diagnosed with GID… Therefore, be it
RESOLVED, that the AMA supports public and private health insurance coverage for  treatment of gender identity disorder.
http://www.tgender.net/taw/ama_resolutions.pdf  
Resolution H-185.950: Removing Financial Barriers to Care for Transgender Patients (2008)  
Our AMA supports public and private health insurance coverage for treatment of gender identity disorder as recommended by the patient’s physician. (Res. 122; A-08)  
http://www.ama-assn.org/resources/doc/PolicyFinder/policyfiles/HnE/H-185.950.HTM

**American Psychiatric Association**  
Position Statement on Access to Care for Transgender and Gender Variant Individuals (2012)  
 The American Psychiatric Association:  
1. Recognizes that appropriately evaluated transgender and gender variant individuals can benefit greatly from medical and surgical gender transition treatments.  
2. Advocates for removal of barriers to care and supports both public and private health insurance coverage for gender transition treatment.  
3. Opposes categorical exclusions of coverage for such medically necessary treatment when prescribed by a physician.

Position Statement on Discrimination Against Transgender and Gender Variant Individuals
(2012)  
 Being transgender gender or variant implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities; however, these individuals often experience discrimination due to a lack of civil rights protections for their gender identity or expression… Thus, this position statement is relevant to the APA because discrimination and lack of equal civil rights is damaging to the mental health of  transgender and gender variant individuals.  

**The American Psychiatric Association:**  
1. Supports laws that protect the civil rights of transgender and gender variant individuals.  
2. Urges the repeal of laws and policies that discriminate against transgender and gender variant individuals.  
3. Opposes all public and private discrimination against transgender and gender variant individuals in such areas as health care, employment, housing, public accommodation, education, and licensing.  
4. Declares that no burden of proof of such judgment, capacity, or reliability shall be placed upon these individuals greater than that imposed on any other persons.

American Psychological Association
Policy on Transgender, Gender Identity &amp; Gender Expression Non-Discrimination (2008)
As stated in the Policy on Transgender, Gender Identity &amp; Gender Expression NonDiscrimination,
the APA “opposes all public and private discrimination on the basis of actual or perceived gender identity and expression and urges the repeal of discriminatory laws and policies” and “calls upon psychologists in their professional roles to provide appropriate, nondiscriminatory treatment to transgender and gender variant individuals and encourages psychologists to take a leadership role in working against discrimination towards transgender and gender variant individuals.” 

The “APA recognizes the efficacy, benefit and medical necessity of gender transition treatments for appropriately evaluated individuals and calls upon public and private insurers to cover these medically necessary treatments.”  
http://www.apa.org/about/policy/transgender.aspx

**American Academy of Family Physicians**  
Resolution No. 1004 (2012)
In 2007, an AAFP Commission declared that the association has a policy opposing any
form of patient discrimination and stated its opposition to the exclusion of transgender
health care. In 2012, the organization released a new resolution: “RESOLVED, That the
American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) support efforts to require insurers to
provide coverage for comprehensive care of [transgender] individuals including medical
care, screening tests based on medical need rather than gender, mental health care, and,
when medically necessary, gender reassignment surgery.”
http://www.aafp.org/dam/AAFP/documents/about_us/special_constituencies/2012RCAR_Advocacy.pdf

**American Academy of Physician Assistants**  
Non-Discrimination Statement  (Adopted 2000; amended 2004, 2006, 2007 and 2008)
“Physician assistants should not discriminate against classes or categories of patients in the delivery of needed health care. Such classes and categories include…gender identity.”

**American College of Nurse Midwives**  
Transgender/Transsexual/Gender Variant Health Care (2012)
The American College of Nurse-Midwives (ACNM) supports efforts to provide transgender, transsexual, and gender variant individuals with access to safe, comprehensive, culturally competent health care and therefore endorses the 2011 World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) Standards of Care

Please see “Ethical Conduct for the Physician Assistant Profession” (Adopted 2000, amended 2004, 2006, 2007, and 2008) and “Comprehensive Health Care Reform” (Adopted 2005 and amended 2010). 

**National Association of Social Workers**  
Transgender and Gender Identity Issues Policy Statement (2008)
 NASW supports the rights of all individuals to receive health insurance and other health coverage without discrimination on the basis of gender identity, and specifically without exclusion of services related to transgender or transsexual transition…in order to receive medical and mental health services through their primary care physician and the appropriate referrals to medical specialists, which may include hormone replacement therapy, surgical interventions, prosthetic devices, and other medical procedures.

**World Professional Association for Transgender Health**  
Clarification on Medical Necessity of Treatment, Sex Reassignment, and Insurance Coverage in the U.S.A. (2008)  
WPATH found that decades of experience with the Standards of Care show gender transitions and related care to be accepted, good medical practice and effective treatment.  
In a 2008 clarification, WPATH stated:

[S]ex reassignment, properly indicated and performed as provided by the Standards of Care, has proven to be beneficial and effective in the treatment of individuals with transsexualism, gender identity disorder, and/or gender dysphoria. Sex reassignment plays an undisputed role in contributing toward favorable outcomes, and comprises Real Life Experience, legal name and sex change on identity documents, as well as medically necessary hormone treatment, counseling, psychotherapy, and other medical procedures...


The medical procedures attendant to sex reassignment are not ‘cosmetic’ or ‘elective’ or for the mere convenience of the patient. These reconstructive procedures are not optional in any meaningful sense, but are understood to be medically necessary for the treatment of the diagnosed condition.

**National Commission on Correctional Health Care**


Position Statement: Transgender Health Care in Correctional Settings (2009) 

The health risks of overlooking the particular needs of transgender inmates are so severe that acknowledgment of the problem and policies that assure appropriate and responsible provision of health care are needed….  
Because prisons, jails, and juvenile justice facilities have a responsibility to ensure the physical and mental health and well-being of transgender people in their custody, correctional health staff should manage these inmates in a manner that respects the
biomedical and psychological aspects of a gender identity disorder (GID) diagnosis.

Who else is picking up on Blanchard's theories? NARTH, for one, whose anti-transgender manifesto is mostly based on his writings. It's also used in the right-wing, anti-transgender campaigns being waged by the Pacific Justice Institute and the like. 
Hey, how about the Family Research Council and the American Family Association? They both cite his theory as a reason that transgender people are sick and should be institutionalized rather than protected. 

Anti-trans pundits like Dr. Keith Ablow rely on Blanchard's typology to deny that transgender people even exist.

Blanchard is cited frequently by other anti-LGBT groups, including Courage (the group Antonin Scalia's son belongs to) and Catholic World Report. And why not? Blanchard was raised Catholic, and he holds the very traditionalist Catholic view that any non-penis-in-vagina sex act is abnormal and should be pathologized. ""Normal sexuality is whatever is related to reproduction,"" Blanchard says.

This kind of “gender policing” is harmful to everyone, whether a transgender person, a butch woman, an effeminate man or anyone dressed or groomed in a way that doesn’t conform to someone else’s gender standards. Moreover, courts have increasingly found that discrimination against transgender people is sex discrimination.

For instance, in Mathis v. Fountain-Fort Carson School District 8, Colorado’s Division of Civil Rights found that denying a transgender girl access to the women’s restroom at school was discrimination. They reasoned, “By not permitting the [student] to use the restroom with which she identities, as non-transgender students are permitted to do, the [school] treated the [student] less favorably than other students seeking the same service.” Furthermore, the court rejected the school’s defense—that the discriminatory policy was implemented to protect the transgender student from harassment—and observed that transgender students are in fact safest when a school does not single them out as different. Based on this finding, it is no longer acceptable to institute different kinds of bathroom rules for transgender and cisgender people.",2016-03-26 18:40:24+00:00,d1eefcu,10.0,t1_d1ee7vd,375.0,atheism

Biology doesn’t work that way. Biological phenomena don’t necessarily fit into human-ordained binary categories. So while humans insist that you’re either male or female – that you have either XY or XX sex chromosomes – biology begs to differ.

For example, genetic men with Klinefelter syndrome possess an extra X chromosome (XXY) or more rarely, two or three extra Xs (XXXY, XXXXY); they typically produce low levels of testosterone, leading to less-developed masculine sexual characteristics and more-developed feminine characteristics than other men. In contrast, some men receive an extra Y chromosome (XYY) in the genetic lottery, and while they have been referred to as “supermales” that is more sensationalism than science.

Genetic women with Turner syndrome have only one X chromosome; they often display less-developed female sexual characteristics than other women. And people with a genetic mosaic possess XX chromosomes in some cells and XY in others. So how do we determine if they’re male or female? Hint: Don’t say that it depends on the chromosomal makeup of the majority of their cells, since women with more than 90 per cent XY genetic material have given birth.

Even if you get the “right” combination of sex chromosomes, it’s no guarantee that you’ll fit into the carefully circumscribed human definitions of male and female.

For example, genetic women (XX) with congenital adrenal hyperplasia produced unusually high levels of virilizing hormones in utero and develop stereotypically masculine sexual characteristics, including masculinized genitals.

Similarly, genetic men (XY) with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome don’t respond to male hormones and fail to develop masculine sexual characteristics. Most live their lives as women. Some historians suggest that Joan of Arc, Elizabeth I and Wallis Simpson all suffered from this syndrome.

So what’s the answer? There isn’t one, at least if we’re looking for the answer in biology. We must not fall back on biology. Rather, we must always remember that it is we, not biology, who decide who counts as male or female. And it is we who must take responsibility for our decisions.",2016-03-26 18:15:02+00:00,d1edkkv,2.0,t1_d1ect5x,1364.0,atheism

There is no rule that a person must look a certain way to use a certain restroom. This kind of “gender policing” is harmful to everyone, whether a transgender person, a butch woman, an effeminate man or anyone dressed or groomed in a way that doesn’t conform to someone else’s gender standards. Moreover, courts have increasingly found that discrimination against transgender people is sex discrimination.

For instance, in Mathis v. Fountain-Fort Carson School District 8, Colorado’s Division of Civil Rights found that denying a transgender girl access to the women’s restroom at school was discrimination. They reasoned, “By not permitting the [student] to use the restroom with which she identities, as non-transgender students are permitted to do, the [school] treated the [student] less favorably than other students seeking the same service.” Furthermore, the court rejected the school’s defense—that the discriminatory policy was implemented to protect the transgender student from harassment—and observed that transgender students are in fact safest when a school does not single them out as different. Based on this finding, it is no longer acceptable to institute different kinds of bathroom rules for transgender and cisgender people.

So, if the bathroom laws pass, students who do not comply will face more than just harassment and bullying from fellow classmates. The real goal of these types of bills is to make it nearly impossible to identify as transgender, whether as a young person or as an adult, or — if someone is able to defy the odds and to come out as trans — these bills will make simply identifying as transgender a crime. In the specific case of the anti-trans bathroom bills that we saw arise last year and multiply this year, the consequences for children who refuse to lie about or deny who they are could be suspension or expulsion

Just as the so-called religious freedom bills are about more than just the right to refuse service because of a “genuinely held religious belief,” these anti-trans bathroom bills are about much more than keeping bathrooms binary. These bills are about policing the life, love, and identity of our community and further criminalizing any life that falls outside of white, cis, Christian heteronormativity.

Studies have shown that such ordinances do not enable predatory behavior, and that indeed, transgender people face danger if they have to use the wrong restroom for their lived gender.

And the Charlotte ordinance only added sexual orientation and gender identity to the city’s antidiscrimination law, but it does not affect employment, only public accommodations. It applies to shops, restaurants, taxi and limousine services, and other businesses that serve the general public. Businesses refusing to serve same-sex weddings or LGBT Pride events, for instance, would be in violation of the ordinance.

5378,"Historically, we were indeed considered mentally ill. The DSM (used in the US) recently declassified us as a 'disorder', but the ICD (used in much of the rest of the world) continues to classify us as a paraphilic disorder (essentially, a fetish). It's worth pointing out, however, that the ICD didn't declassify homosexuality as a disorder until the 90s (in fact, they did so in the current version of the ICD), two decades after the DSM declassified it. It also classifies the vast majority of the population as sex disordered, since things like enjoying kinky sex are disordered by the ICD's standards. The current draft of the upcoming new ICD edition also declassifies us as mentally ill, following the DSM's example.

But I would say we are not disordered, for three primary reasons: one, we show some basis in fact for our identification; two, unlike true delusional or somatoform disorders (which seem the most obvious comparison), psychiatric medication does not affect our feelings; and three, unlike true delusional/somatoform disorders, allowing us to pursue our feelings is far from destructive and in fact has exceptionally well-demonstrated positive results.

As best we can tell, gender identity is at least partially determined by brain structure formed very early in fetal development. A few studies show patterns typical of our identified gender and not of our birth sex.

Moreover, transgenderism correlates strongly with endocrine conditions - if we look at people born with externally female bodies, those with PCOS (which raises testosterone) are much more likely to ultimately identify as men; those with CAIS (which makes their bodies incapable of responding to testosterone) almost never do, to the point that single cases merit publication in their own right. On top of that, digit ratio (a marker of prenatal testosterone exposure) displays markedly low T exposure on average in trans women and high T exposure in trans men.

There's even some experimental evidence that, when cis (=not trans) people are categorized contrary to their birth sex, they experience the same distress that trans people do. Under the assumption that gender is malleable to social expectations, David Reimer was raised as a girl after a botched circumcision. He found himself uncomfortable with the female role, displayed symptoms typical of what would be expected of a trans man (that's FTM, to be clear), and ultimately transitioned to living as a man as soon as he became aware of his status in his early teens. And on the flip side, an author named Norah Vincent spent a year living as a man for the purposes of writing a book. By the end of that time, she was so depressed she checked herself into a mental institution because she was worried she might harm herself.

Additionally, trans feelings simply don't respond to psychiatric medication designed to 'cure' them. No professional organization in the world - even those that do classify us as a mental illness for (I feel) mostly historical/political reasons - recommends just giving us SSRIs or the like and sending us away. Traditional therapies simply do not work.

Compare this with Body Dysmorphic Disorder, a disorder that could be seen as an analog to trans people. BDD sufferers fixate on a small (e.g., a mole) or nonexistent part of their bodies, which they believe makes them hideous and unlovable. Some seek out treatment to remove the offending part. But BDD, unlike trans people, responds well to both therapy and SSRIs and does not respond to their desired interventions.",2016-03-25 15:35:30+00:00,d1d3ebb,2.0,t1_d1d33zj,428.0,politics
5379,"Biology doesn’t work that way. Biological phenomena don’t necessarily fit into human-ordained binary categories. So while humans insist that you’re either male or female – that you have either XY or XX sex chromosomes – biology begs to differ.

For example, genetic men with Klinefelter syndrome possess an extra X chromosome (XXY) or more rarely, two or three extra Xs (XXXY, XXXXY); they typically produce low levels of testosterone, leading to less-developed masculine sexual characteristics and more-developed feminine characteristics than other men. In contrast, some men receive an extra Y chromosome (XYY) in the genetic lottery, and while they have been referred to as “supermales” that is more sensationalism than science.

Genetic women with Turner syndrome have only one X chromosome; they often display less-developed female sexual characteristics than other women. And people with a genetic mosaic possess XX chromosomes in some cells and XY in others. So how do we determine if they’re male or female? Hint: Don’t say that it depends on the chromosomal makeup of the majority of their cells, since women with more than 90 per cent XY genetic material have given birth.

Even if you get the “right” combination of sex chromosomes, it’s no guarantee that you’ll fit into the carefully circumscribed human definitions of male and female.

For example, genetic women (XX) with congenital adrenal hyperplasia produced unusually high levels of virilizing hormones in utero and develop stereotypically masculine sexual characteristics, including masculinized genitals.

Similarly, genetic men (XY) with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome don’t respond to male hormones and fail to develop masculine sexual characteristics. Most live their lives as women. Some historians suggest that Joan of Arc, Elizabeth I and Wallis Simpson all suffered from this syndrome.

So what’s the answer? There isn’t one, at least if we’re looking for the answer in biology. We must not fall back on biology. Rather, we must always remember that it is we, not biology, who decide who counts as male or female. And it is we who must take responsibility for our decisions.",2016-03-25 15:33:02+00:00,d1d3aqe,2.0,t1_d1d37pl,126.0,politics

5399,"Biology doesn’t work that way. Biological phenomena don’t necessarily fit into human-ordained binary categories. So while humans insist that you’re either male or female – that you have either XY or XX sex chromosomes – biology begs to differ.

For example, genetic men with Klinefelter syndrome possess an extra X chromosome (XXY) or more rarely, two or three extra Xs (XXXY, XXXXY); they typically produce low levels of testosterone, leading to less-developed masculine sexual characteristics and more-developed feminine characteristics than other men. In contrast, some men receive an extra Y chromosome (XYY) in the genetic lottery, and while they have been referred to as “supermales” that is more sensationalism than science.

Genetic women with Turner syndrome have only one X chromosome; they often display less-developed female sexual characteristics than other women. And people with a genetic mosaic possess XX chromosomes in some cells and XY in others. So how do we determine if they’re male or female? Hint: Don’t say that it depends on the chromosomal makeup of the majority of their cells, since women with more than 90 per cent XY genetic material have given birth.

Even if you get the “right” combination of sex chromosomes, it’s no guarantee that you’ll fit into the carefully circumscribed human definitions of male and female.

For example, genetic women (XX) with congenital adrenal hyperplasia produced unusually high levels of virilizing hormones in utero and develop stereotypically masculine sexual characteristics, including masculinized genitals.

Similarly, genetic men (XY) with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome don’t respond to male hormones and fail to develop masculine sexual characteristics. Most live their lives as women. Some historians suggest that Joan of Arc, Elizabeth I and Wallis Simpson all suffered from this syndrome.

So what’s the answer? There isn’t one, at least if we’re looking for the answer in biology. We must not fall back on biology. Rather, we must always remember that it is we, not biology, who decide who counts as male or female. And it is we who must take responsibility for our decisions.",2016-03-23 15:03:09+00:00,d1aiv66,2.0,t1_d1aiti4,67.0,politics

5409,"Biology doesn’t work that way. Biological phenomena don’t necessarily fit into human-ordained binary categories. So while humans insist that you’re either male or female – that you have either XY or XX sex chromosomes – biology begs to differ.

For example, genetic men with Klinefelter syndrome possess an extra X chromosome (XXY) or more rarely, two or three extra Xs (XXXY, XXXXY); they typically produce low levels of testosterone, leading to less-developed masculine sexual characteristics and more-developed feminine characteristics than other men. In contrast, some men receive an extra Y chromosome (XYY) in the genetic lottery, and while they have been referred to as “supermales” that is more sensationalism than science.

Genetic women with Turner syndrome have only one X chromosome; they often display less-developed female sexual characteristics than other women. And people with a genetic mosaic possess XX chromosomes in some cells and XY in others. So how do we determine if they’re male or female? Hint: Don’t say that it depends on the chromosomal makeup of the majority of their cells, since women with more than 90 per cent XY genetic material have given birth.

Even if you get the “right” combination of sex chromosomes, it’s no guarantee that you’ll fit into the carefully circumscribed human definitions of male and female.

For example, genetic women (XX) with congenital adrenal hyperplasia produced unusually high levels of virilizing hormones in utero and develop stereotypically masculine sexual characteristics, including masculinized genitals.

Similarly, genetic men (XY) with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome don’t respond to male hormones and fail to develop masculine sexual characteristics. Most live their lives as women. Some historians suggest that Joan of Arc, Elizabeth I and Wallis Simpson all suffered from this syndrome.

So what’s the answer? There isn’t one, at least if we’re looking for the answer in biology. We must not fall back on biology. Rather, we must always remember that it is we, not biology, who decide who counts as male or female. And it is we who must take responsibility for our decisions.",2016-03-23 01:01:27+00:00,d19wdt1,4.0,t1_d19rj27,7448.0,politics

The school argued that IRS’ regulations denying tax exemptions to racist institutions “cannot constitutionally be applied to schools that engage in racial discrimination on the basis of sincerely held religious beliefs.”

RESOLVED, that the AMA supports public and private health insurance coverage for  treatment of gender identity disorder.

**American Psychiatric Association**  
Position Statement on Access to Care for Transgender and Gender Variant Individuals (2012)  
 The American Psychiatric Association:  
1. Recognizes that appropriately evaluated transgender and gender variant individuals can benefit greatly from medical and surgical gender transition treatments.  
2. Advocates for removal of barriers to care and supports both public and private health insurance coverage for gender transition treatment.  
3. Opposes categorical exclusions of coverage for such medically necessary treatment when prescribed by a physician.

Position Statement on Discrimination Against Transgender and Gender Variant Individuals
(2012)  
 Being transgender gender or variant implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities; however, these individuals often experience discrimination due to a lack of civil rights protections for their gender identity or expression… Thus, this position statement is relevant to the APA because discrimination and lack of equal civil rights is damaging to the mental health of  transgender and gender variant individuals.  

**The American Psychiatric Association:**  
1. Supports laws that protect the civil rights of transgender and gender variant individuals.  
2. Urges the repeal of laws and policies that discriminate against transgender and gender variant individuals.  
3. Opposes all public and private discrimination against transgender and gender variant individuals in such areas as health care, employment, housing, public accommodation, education, and licensing.  
4. Declares that no burden of proof of such judgment, capacity, or reliability shall be placed upon these individuals greater than that imposed on any other persons.

American Psychological Association
Policy on Transgender, Gender Identity &amp; Gender Expression Non-Discrimination (2008)
As stated in the Policy on Transgender, Gender Identity &amp; Gender Expression NonDiscrimination,
the APA “opposes all public and private discrimination on the basis of actual or perceived gender identity and expression and urges the repeal of discriminatory laws and policies” and “calls upon psychologists in their professional roles to provide appropriate, nondiscriminatory treatment to transgender and gender variant individuals and encourages psychologists to take a leadership role in working against discrimination towards transgender and gender variant individuals.” 

The “APA recognizes the efficacy, benefit and medical necessity of gender transition treatments for appropriately evaluated individuals and calls upon public and private insurers to cover these medically necessary treatments.”

**American Academy of Family Physicians**  
Resolution No. 1004 (2012)
In 2007, an AAFP Commission declared that the association has a policy opposing any
form of patient discrimination and stated its opposition to the exclusion of transgender
health care. In 2012, the organization released a new resolution: “RESOLVED, That the
American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) support efforts to require insurers to
provide coverage for comprehensive care of [transgender] individuals including medical
care, screening tests based on medical need rather than gender, mental health care, and,
when medically necessary, gender reassignment surgery.”

**American Academy of Physician Assistants**  
Non-Discrimination Statement  (Adopted 2000; amended 2004, 2006, 2007 and 2008)
“Physician assistants should not discriminate against classes or categories of patients in the delivery of needed health care. Such classes and categories include…gender identity.”

**American College of Nurse Midwives**  
Transgender/Transsexual/Gender Variant Health Care (2012)
The American College of Nurse-Midwives (ACNM) supports efforts to provide transgender, transsexual, and gender variant individuals with access to safe, comprehensive, culturally competent health care and therefore endorses the 2011 World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) Standards of Care

Please see “Ethical Conduct for the Physician Assistant Profession” (Adopted 2000, amended 2004, 2006, 2007, and 2008) and “Comprehensive Health Care Reform” (Adopted 2005 and amended 2010). 

**National Association of Social Workers**  
Transgender and Gender Identity Issues Policy Statement (2008)
 NASW supports the rights of all individuals to receive health insurance and other health coverage without discrimination on the basis of gender identity, and specifically without exclusion of services related to transgender or transsexual transition…in order to receive medical and mental health services through their primary care physician and the appropriate referrals to medical specialists, which may include hormone replacement therapy, surgical interventions, prosthetic devices, and other medical procedures.

**World Professional Association for Transgender Health**  
Clarification on Medical Necessity of Treatment, Sex Reassignment, and Insurance Coverage in the U.S.A. (2008)  
WPATH found that decades of experience with the Standards of Care show gender transitions and related care to be accepted, good medical practice and effective treatment.  
In a 2008 clarification, WPATH stated:

[S]ex reassignment, properly indicated and performed as provided by the Standards of Care, has proven to be beneficial and effective in the treatment of individuals with transsexualism, gender identity disorder, and/or gender dysphoria. Sex reassignment plays an undisputed role in contributing toward favorable outcomes, and comprises Real Life Experience, legal name and sex change on identity documents, as well as medically necessary hormone treatment, counseling, psychotherapy, and other medical procedures...


The medical procedures attendant to sex reassignment are not ‘cosmetic’ or ‘elective’ or for the mere convenience of the patient. These reconstructive procedures are not optional in any meaningful sense, but are understood to be medically necessary for the treatment of the diagnosed condition.

**National Commission on Correctional Health Care**


Position Statement: Transgender Health Care in Correctional Settings (2009) 

The health risks of overlooking the particular needs of transgender inmates are so severe that acknowledgment of the problem and policies that assure appropriate and responsible provision of health care are needed….  
Because prisons, jails, and juvenile justice facilities have a responsibility to ensure the physical and mental health and well-being of transgender people in their custody, correctional health staff should manage these inmates in a manner that respects the
biomedical and psychological aspects of a gender identity disorder (GID) diagnosis.

Instead, societal ignorance, prejudice and pressure to conform to heterosexual desires are the real dangers to gay people's mental health, according to a 1997 statement on ""conversion"" or ""reparative"" therapy by the APA.

A 2009 APA task force found that conversion therapies, despite being touted by religious organizations, have little evidence to back them up. A review of studies from 1960 to 2007 found only 83 on the topic, the vast majority of which did not have the experimental muscle to show whether the therapies achieved their stated goals. (Many of the people studied in the early years were court-mandated to take the therapies, adding a coercive element to those outcomes.)

The best-quality studies were more recent and qualitative, the APA task force found, meaning they focused not on the statistical effectiveness of treatment, but of the subjective experience.

""These studies show that enduring change to an individual's sexual orientation is uncommon,"" the task force wrote in their 2009 report. The participants continued to report same-sex attractions after the conversion therapy, and were not significantly more attracted to the opposite gender.

These studies did find that conversion therapy could be harmful, however. Negative effects included ""loss of sexual feeling, depression, suicidality and anxiety.""

all the points in that article arent based on any  scientific fact. it's all conjecture with a little bit of conspiracy theorist thrown in for good measure. That's like saying ""if you masturbate too much, you'll get hairy palms, and the illuminati are seeding the water supply with sex pheromones to make you horny so you masturbate more""

now let’s look at what the science says. Hundreds of species engage in homosexual behavior—swans, elephants, bison, apes. For example, about 8 percent of rams exhibit sexual preference for males; researchers at the Oregon Health and Science University discovered a cell group called the ovine sexually dimorphic nucleus is twice as large in rams that prefer ewes compared with those that prefer other rams.

There are genetic differences between gay and straight people as well. The May 2015 issue of Psychological Medicine found significant linkage between gay sexual orientation and genes on the pericentromeric chromosome 8 and chromosome Xq28. Plenty of studies that have found other correlations.

and you're also conflating sexual orientation and gender identity. Hmm, maybe that's a question best left to psychologists, biologists, anthropologists, and sociologists. So with that in mind, perhaps you'd like to avail yourself of the latest scientific papers and findings.

AHBs also relatively resistant to other things that prey on commercial honeybees, including ""foulbrood"" bacteria, the ""chalkbrood"" fungal disease, a parasite called Nosema, and the Israeli acute paralysis virus. Mites do kill (killer bee colonies), but it takes two to three years, and by then, they've put off 15 to 20 new swarms (high reproduction rates is another trait they developed to withstand African predators). So mites don't really affect the population dynamics of the AHBs.

In a 2008 clarification, WPATH stated:  
[S]ex reassignment, properly indicated and performed as provided by the Standards of Care, has proven to be beneficial and effective in the treatment of individuals with transsexualism, gender identity disorder, and/or gender dysphoria. Sex reassignment plays an undisputed role in contributing toward favorable outcomes, and comprises Real Life Experience, legal name and sex change on identity documents, as well as medically necessary hormone treatment, counseling, psychotherapy, and other medical procedures...  

The medical procedures attendant to sex reassignment are not ‘cosmetic’ or ‘elective’ or for the mere convenience of the patient. These reconstructive procedures are not optional in any meaningful sense, but are understood to be medically necessary for the treatment of the diagnosed condition.

Because prisons, jails, and juvenile justice facilities have a responsibility to ensure the physical and mental health and well-being of transgender people in their custody, correctional health staff should manage these inmates in a manner that respects the biomedical and psychological aspects of a gender identity disorder (GID) diagnosis.

5687,"Unnatural sex or sodomy was not defined in the Indian Penal Code drafted by the British. Legal records show that Indian legislators in the 19th and early 20th centuries interpreted ""carnal intercourse against the order of nature"" between individuals (of all sexes - the law being non-gender specific with its use of the word ""whoever"") to include anal sex, bestiality and, often after much courtroom deliberation, oral sex as well, namely, any form of sexual intercourse which did not have the potential for procreation.

Therefore, both heterosexual and homosexual oral and anal sex were criminal offences. In this particular narrow sense, Section 377 did not discriminate against homosexuals. However, early cases tried in India mainly involved forced fellatio with unwilling male children and one unusual case of sexual intercourse with the nostril of a buffalo.

Theoretically, even lesbian sex which involved penetration, e.g. of a finger or sex toy into the vagina or anus, would be covered under the law, although there are no records of any judge in India or any other British colony interpreting the law to include sex between women.

In the Singaporean context, recent cases had established that heterosexual fellatio was exempted if indulged in as foreplay which eventually leads to coitus. The Singaporean margin note of the original Section 377 further explained that mere penetration of the penis into the anus or mouth even without orgasm would constitute the offence. The law applied regardless of the act being consensual between both parties and done in private.

Owing to overwhelming public support and the realisation by the politico-legal system that the statute was no longer relevant to contemporary society, Section 377 was repealed in October 2007. A new Section 377, which criminalises sex with dead bodies (""Sexual penetration of a corpse""), was substituted in its place.

**Section 377A**  
Section 377A was introduced into the Singapore Penal Code in 1938 to criminalise all other non-penetrative sexual acts between men. Research is currently underway, facilitated by the digitisation of local newspapers in 2008, to fathom the reasons why the colonial administration sought to enact such a law here when there were more pressing concerns in an era when civilised nations were on the brink of the second World War.

One hypothesis is that prostitution, including that by transvestites, was rife during the early decades of the 20th century. In endeavouring to curb it, the British must have found it difficult to use Section 377 to prosecute cross-dressers, who were legally men, for having sex with their male clients if prima facie evidence of anal or oral sex could not be found. In these cases, a new law such as Section 377A which was vague enough to convict any form of non-penetrative sexual activity between men, or more accurately, a cross-dressing man and his outwardly male partner, could be used as a backup. The fact that two ""men"" were found naked together in an enclosed space would be sufficient for a charge to be made against them.

**The Labouchere Amendment**  
The term ""gross indecency"" used in the statute was based on the wording of the Labouchere Amendment, also known as Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 of the UK. It was not a euphemism for buggery or sodomy, which was already a crime but rather, any other sexual activity between men.

It was worded as follows:

""Any male person who, in public or private, commits, or is a party to the commission of, or procures, or attempts to procure the commission by any male person of, any act of gross indecency shall be guilty of a misdemeanour, and being convicted shall be liable at the discretion of the Court to be imprisoned for any term not exceeding two years, with or without hard labour.""

The almost identical phrasing between the Labouchere Amendment and Section 377A is the best evidence that the latter was derived from the former.",2016-03-08 09:01:14+00:00,d0rvg81,8.0,t1_d0rvapr,590.0,singapore

5698,"&gt;""Sex is defined biologically.""

That is based on a misunderstanding of biology, social constructs, and anatomy. It is a simplistic and outdated understanding of biology to perpetuate some very dangerous ideas about trans people. You are just continuing to see them as something other than real men or women.

The thing people like you want to cling to the most is the idea that sex is an immutable, universal biological reality that is therefore easy to categorize. You argue that that sex is an unchanging biological fact, and that therefore their sex is still male or female.

“Biological sex” is actually a social construct, those who say that it is not often have to argue about what it entails. Some say it’s based on chromosomes (of which there are many non-XX/XY combinations, as well as diversity among people with XY chromosomes), others say it’s genitals or gonads (either at birth or at the moment you’re talking about), others say it’s hormone levels (which vary widely and can be manipulated), still others say it’s secondary sex characteristics like the appearance of breasts, body hair and muscle mass (which vary even more). Some say that it’s a combination of all of them. Now, this creates a huge problem, as sex organs, secondary sex characteristics and hormone levels aren’t anywhere close to being universal to all men or women, males or females.

Those who claim that sex is determined by chromosomes must not realize that sex is assigned at birth not by chromosomes, not even by gonads, but by genitals. In fact, the vast majority of us never learn what our sex chromosomes are. Sex isn’t something we’re actually born with, it’s something that doctors or our parents assign us at birth. So if sex is determined by genitals, they must be clearly binary and unchangable, right? Wrong. Genitals can be ambiguous at birth and many trans people get gender confirmation surgery to change them. Neither chromosomes nor genitals are binary in the way that “biological sex” defenders claim they are, and the vast majority of measures by which we judge sex are very much changable.

While it is true that gender and sex are different things, and that gender is indeed a social construct, sex isn’t the Ultimate Biological Reality that transphobes make it out to be. There’s nothing intrinsically male about XY chromosomes, testosterone, body hair, muscle mass or penises. If an alien civilization found earth, they wouldn’t look at a person with a penis and say “Oh, that must be a male, sex based on genitalia is the One Universal Constant.” Sex, like gender, is indeed socially constructed and can be changed.

If sex isn’t the All Mighty Binary Universal Constant that some people think it is, why do they place so much importance on it? The easy answer is that it gives them an excuse to misgender and exclude trans people, and specifically trans women. They can pretend they’re just standing up for science, but they’re really just saying that trans women aren’t fully women and that trans men aren’t fully men. People need to start learning about what sex really is and what social constructs really are. ",2016-03-08 07:39:58+00:00,d0ru2et,6.0,t1_d0ru09m,186.0,LGBTnews

MAO-B preferentially deaminates phenethylamine and certain other trace amines; in contrast, MAO-A preferentially deaminates other trace amines, like tyramine, whereas dopamine is equally deaminated by both types.",2016-03-08 06:38:33+00:00,d0rsu0u,4.0,t1_d0rsqws,231.0,science
5701,"Biology doesn’t work that way. Biological phenomena don’t necessarily fit into human-ordained binary categories. So while humans insist that you’re either male or female – that you have either XY or XX sex chromosomes – biology begs to differ.

For example, genetic men with Klinefelter syndrome possess an extra X chromosome (XXY) or more rarely, two or three extra Xs (XXXY, XXXXY); they typically produce low levels of testosterone, leading to less-developed masculine sexual characteristics and more-developed feminine characteristics than other men. In contrast, some men receive an extra Y chromosome (XYY) in the genetic lottery, and while they have been referred to as “supermales” that is more sensationalism than science.

Genetic women with Turner syndrome have only one X chromosome; they often display less-developed female sexual characteristics than other women. And people with a genetic mosaic possess XX chromosomes in some cells and XY in others. So how do we determine if they’re male or female? Hint: Don’t say that it depends on the chromosomal makeup of the majority of their cells, since women with more than 90 per cent XY genetic material have given birth.

Even if you get the “right” combination of sex chromosomes, it’s no guarantee that you’ll fit into the carefully circumscribed human definitions of male and female.

For example, genetic women (XX) with congenital adrenal hyperplasia produced unusually high levels of virilizing hormones in utero and develop stereotypically masculine sexual characteristics, including masculinized genitals.

Similarly, genetic men (XY) with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome don’t respond to male hormones and fail to develop masculine sexual characteristics. Most live their lives as women. Some historians suggest that Joan of Arc, Elizabeth I and Wallis Simpson all suffered from this syndrome.

So what’s the answer? There isn’t one, at least if we’re looking for the answer in biology. We must not fall back on biology. Rather, we must always remember that it is we, not biology, who decide who counts as male or female. And it is we who must take responsibility for our decisions.",2016-03-08 06:34:04+00:00,d0rsqeb,4.0,t1_d0rmq2b,11366.0,LGBTnews

5717,"Some animals behave as if they were the opposite sex; others can even change their sex — and still produce offspring. 

Outside of perhaps the great apes, there’s very little evidence of a concept of “self” in animals. This means animals don’t have a sense that they are acting male or female. They merely express behaviors that are typical — and sometimes not typical — of the sex they belong to. Despite that, there are many examples of intersex conditions within the animal kingdom. Such signs of both sexes can show up both in behaviors and in physical traits.

For instance, the 1999 book Biological Exuberance points out that more than 50 species of coral-reef fish possess the ability to reverse their sex organs (egg-making ovaries and sperm-making testes). This is called  trans-sexuality. It can affect wrasses, groupers, parrotfish, angelfish and more. The fish that begin life as females, with fully functioning ovaries, can undergo a dramatic change. Voilà, they now have a fully functioning male reproductive anatomy. Even after their sex-change, both males and females can reproduce.

Several types of birds, such as warblers and ostriches, also can exhibit a mosaic of male and female characteristics. The color patterns, plumage, singing and other characteristics of one sex may show up in some members of the opposite sex. 

Researchers have documented intersex conditions in grizzly, black and polar bears. In certain populations, a small percentage of female bears possess genitalia that resemble those of male bears. Some of these sows give birth to cubs, despite looking like a boar (a male bear). Intersexuality also has shown up in baboons, deer, moose, buffalo and kangaroos. No one is sure why. But in at least some instances, water pollutants — such as pesticides — have led to clearly abnormal conditions. For instance, biologists have found eggs in the testes of some male alligators and fish that had been exposed to certain pesticides.

In some experiments, pesticide exposures even turned genetically male frogs into what appeared to be females. These Mr. Moms could bear healthy offspring — although they were always male (as each of their parents had been). In other instances, intersex conditions have arisen in completely natural settings.

But perhaps one of the best examples of sex plasticity comes from a new study in European frogs. A single species — Rana temporaria — lives in woodlands from Spain to Norway. Roughly equal numbers of males and females develop from tadpoles in the northern “race” of these frogs. But in the southern region, another race of the species produces females only. They are complete with ovaries, the organ to make eggs. Yet all of the frogs don’t stay female. About half will eventually lose their ovaries and develop testes. They are now males and able to reproduce.",2016-03-07 22:39:56+00:00,d0rbk3m,8.0,t1_d0r5myb,8162.0,politics

5720,"&gt;""Sex is defined biologically.""

That is based on a misunderstanding of biology, social constructs, and anatomy. It is a simplistic and outdated understanding of biology to perpetuate some very dangerous ideas about trans people. You are just continuing to see them as something other than real men or women.

The thing people like you want to cling to the most is the idea that sex is an immutable, universal biological reality that is therefore easy to categorize. You argue that that sex is an unchanging biological fact, and that therefore their sex is still male or female.

“Biological sex” is actually a social construct, those who say that it is not often have to argue about what it entails. Some say it’s based on chromosomes (of which there are many non-XX/XY combinations, as well as diversity among people with XY chromosomes), others say it’s genitals or gonads (either at birth or at the moment you’re talking about), others say it’s hormone levels (which vary widely and can be manipulated), still others say it’s secondary sex characteristics like the appearance of breasts, body hair and muscle mass (which vary even more). Some say that it’s a combination of all of them. Now, this creates a huge problem, as sex organs, secondary sex characteristics and hormone levels aren’t anywhere close to being universal to all men or women, males or females.

Those who claim that sex is determined by chromosomes must not realize that sex is assigned at birth not by chromosomes, not even by gonads, but by genitals. In fact, the vast majority of us never learn what our sex chromosomes are. Sex isn’t something we’re actually born with, it’s something that doctors or our parents assign us at birth. So if sex is determined by genitals, they must be clearly binary and unchangable, right? Wrong. Genitals can be ambiguous at birth and many trans people get gender confirmation surgery to change them. Neither chromosomes nor genitals are binary in the way that “biological sex” defenders claim they are, and the vast majority of measures by which we judge sex are very much changable.

While it is true that gender and sex are different things, and that gender is indeed a social construct, sex isn’t the Ultimate Biological Reality that transphobes make it out to be. There’s nothing intrinsically male about XY chromosomes, testosterone, body hair, muscle mass or penises. If an alien civilization found earth, they wouldn’t look at a person with a penis and say “Oh, that must be a male, sex based on genitalia is the One Universal Constant.” Sex, like gender, is indeed socially constructed and can be changed.

If sex isn’t the All Mighty Binary Universal Constant that some people think it is, why do they place so much importance on it? The easy answer is that it gives them an excuse to misgender and exclude trans people, and specifically trans women. They can pretend they’re just standing up for science, but they’re really just saying that trans women aren’t fully women and that trans men aren’t fully men. People need to start learning about what sex really is and what social constructs really are. ",2016-03-07 20:18:33+00:00,d0r5ee1,6.0,t1_d0r4e8u,1361.0,politics
5721,"People tend to define sex in a binary way — either wholly male or wholly female — based on physical appearance or by which sex chromosomes an individual carries. But while sex and gender may seem dichotomous, there are in reality many intermediates.

 Understanding this complexity is critical; misperceptions can affect the health and civil liberties of those who fall outside perceived societal norms. Society has categorical views on what should define sex and gender, but the biological reality is just not there to support that.

 

 

Even at the most basic physical level, there is a spectrum between male and female that often goes unrecognized and risks being obscured by stigma. 

A growing body of research is showing how biology influences gender expression, sexual orientation and gender identity — characteristics that can also fall outside of strict, socially defined categories. Toy-preference tests, a popular gauge of gender expression, have long shown that boys and girls will typically gravitate to toys that are stereotypically associated with their gender (cars and guns for boys, for instance, or plush toys for girls). While one might argue that this could be the by-product of a child’s environment — parental influence at play or an internalization of societal norms — Melissa Hines, a former UCLA researcher and current professor of psychology at the University of Cambridge, in England, has shown otherwise. In 2008, she demonstrated that monkeys showed the same sex-based toy preferences as humans — absent societal influence.

Sexual orientation (whether one tends to be attracted to men or women) has also been shown to have biological roots. Twin studies and genetic linkage studies have shown both hereditary patterns in homosexuality (attraction to one’s own sex), as well as genetic associations with specific parts of the genome. And while gender identity — the sense one has of oneself as being either male or female — has been harder to pinpoint from a biological standpoint, efforts to understand what role biology may play are ongoing.",2016-03-07 19:42:37+00:00,d0r3t5y,4.0,t1_d0r3nxy,202.0,politics

5723,"Biology doesn’t work that way. Biological phenomena don’t necessarily fit into human-ordained binary categories. So while humans insist that you’re either male or female – that you have either XY or XX sex chromosomes – biology begs to differ.

For example, genetic men with Klinefelter syndrome possess an extra X chromosome (XXY) or more rarely, two or three extra Xs (XXXY, XXXXY); they typically produce low levels of testosterone, leading to less-developed masculine sexual characteristics and more-developed feminine characteristics than other men. In contrast, some men receive an extra Y chromosome (XYY) in the genetic lottery, and while they have been referred to as “supermales” that is more sensationalism than science.

Genetic women with Turner syndrome have only one X chromosome; they often display less-developed female sexual characteristics than other women. And people with a genetic mosaic possess XX chromosomes in some cells and XY in others. So how do we determine if they’re male or female? Hint: Don’t say that it depends on the chromosomal makeup of the majority of their cells, since women with more than 90 per cent XY genetic material have given birth.

Even if you get the “right” combination of sex chromosomes, it’s no guarantee that you’ll fit into the carefully circumscribed human definitions of male and female.

For example, genetic women (XX) with congenital adrenal hyperplasia produced unusually high levels of virilizing hormones in utero and develop stereotypically masculine sexual characteristics, including masculinized genitals.

Similarly, genetic men (XY) with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome don’t respond to male hormones and fail to develop masculine sexual characteristics. Most live their lives as women. Some historians suggest that Joan of Arc, Elizabeth I and Wallis Simpson all suffered from this syndrome.

So what’s the answer? There isn’t one, at least if we’re looking for the answer in biology. We must not fall back on biology. Rather, we must always remember that it is we, not biology, who decide who counts as male or female. And it is we who must take responsibility for our decisions.",2016-03-07 19:16:14+00:00,d0r2nd0,2.0,t1_d0r2jok,137.0,politics

[Transgender: Evidence on the biological nature of gender identity](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/02/150213112317.htm)

**Genetics**  
The androgen receptor (AR), also known as NR3C4, is activated by the binding of testosterone or dihydrotestosterone, where it plays a critical role in the forming of primary and secondary male sex characteristics. Hare et al. found that male-to-female transsexuals were found to have longer repetitions of the gene, which reduced its effectiveness at binding testosterone.

A variant genotype for a gene called CYP17, which acts on the sex hormones pregnenolone and progesterone, has been found to be linked to female-to-male transsexualism but not MTF transsexualism. Most notably, the FTM subjects not only had the variant genotype more frequently, but had an allele distribution equivalent to male controls, unlike the female controls. The paper concluded that the loss of a female-specific CYP17 T -34C allele distribution pattern is associated with FtM transsexualism.

**Brain structure**  
In a first-of-its-kind study, Zhou et al. (1995) found that in a region of the brain called the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTc), a region known for sex and anxiety responses, MTF transsexuals have a female-normal size while FTM transsexuals have a male-normal size. While the transsexuals studied had taken hormones, this was accounted for by including non-transsexual male and female controls who, for a variety of medical reasons, had experienced hormone reversal. The controls still retained sizes typical for their gender. No relationship to sexual orientation was found.

In a follow-up study, Kruijver et al. (2000) looked at the number of neurons in BSTc instead of volumes. They found the same results as Zhou et al. (1995), but with even more dramatic differences. One MTF subject who had never gone on hormones was also included, and who matched up with the female neuron counts nonetheless.

In 2002, a follow-up study by Chung et al. found that significant sexual dimorphism (variation between sexes) in BSTc did not become established until adulthood. Chung et al. theorized that either changes in fetal hormone levels produce changes in BSTc synaptic density, neuronal activity, or neurochemical content which later lead to size and neuron count changes in BSTc, or that the size of BSTc is affected by the failure to generate a gender identity consistent with one's anatomic sex.

In a review of the evidence in 2006, Gooren confirms the earlier research as supporting the concept that transsexualism is a sexual differentiation disorder of the sex dimorphic brain. Dick Swaab (2004) concurs.

In 2008, a new region with properties similar to that of BSTc in regards to transsexualism was found by Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab: the interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH3), part of the hypothalamic uncinate nucleus. The same method of controlling for hormone usage was used as in Zhou et al. (1995) and Kruijver et al. (2000). The differences were even more pronounced than with BSTc; control males averaged 1.9 times the volume and 2.3 times the neurons as control females, yet once again, regardless of hormone exposure, MTF transsexuals lay within the female range and the FTM transsexual within the male range.

While the resolution of MRI tomographs in general can be fine enough, independent nuclei are not visible due to lack of contrast between different neurological tissue types. Therefore, such images do not show detailed structures such as BSTc and INAH3, and studies on BSTC were done by bisecting brains postmortem.

However, MRI does much more easily allow the study of larger brain structures. In Luders et al. (2009), 24 MTF transsexuals not-yet treated with cross-sex hormones were studied via MRI. While regional gray matter concentrations were more similar to men than women, there was a significantly larger volume of gray matter in the right putamen compared to men. As with many earlier studies, they concluded that transsexualism is associated with a distinct cerebral pattern.

An additional feature was studied in a group of FTM transsexuals who had not yet received cross-sex hormones: fractional anisotropy values for white matter in the medial and posterior parts of the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), the forceps minor, and the corticospinal tract. Rametti et al. (2010) discovered that, ""Compared to control females, FtM showed higher FA values in posterior part of the right SLF, the forceps minor and corticospinal tract. Compared to control males, FtM showed only lower FA values in the corticospinal tract.""

Hulshoff Pol et al. (2006), studied the gross brain volume of subjects undergoing hormone treatment. They discovered that whole brain volume for subjects changes toward the size of the opposite sex during hormone treatment. The conclusion of the study was, ""The findings suggest that, throughout life, gonadal hormones remain essential for maintaining aspects of sex-specific differences in the human brain.""

**Brain plasticity**  
Brain structure differences associated with transsexualism do not exist in isolation. Similar brain structure differences have been noted between gay and heterosexual men, and between lesbian and heterosexual women.

More recent studies have found that circumstance and repeated activities such as meditation modify brain structures in a process called brain plasticity or neuroplasticity. In May 2014, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reported that parenting ""rewires the male brain"" for fathers.

**Brain function**  
Phantom limb syndrome is a common, often painful experience after the loss of an external organ. Ramachandran (2008) found that while nearly two thirds of non-transsexual males who have a penis surgically removed experience the sensation of a phantom penis, only one third of MTF transsexuals do so after sex reassignment surgery. This study, however, overlooks the differences between an amputation, where the nerves connecting the penis and the brain are severed, and male-to-female gender reassignment surgery, where some of the penis and scrotum may be reused to create a vaginal canal, labia and a clitoris. In this case, some of the nerves connecting the new genitalia to the brain remain largely intact. Also, two-thirds of FTM transsexuals reported the sensation of a phantom penis from childhood onwards, complete with phantom erections and other phenomena.

Berglund et al. (2008) tested the response of gynephilic MTF transsexuals to two sex pheromones: the progestin-like 4,16-androstadien-3-one (AND) and the estrogen-like 1,3,5(10),16-tetraen-3-ol (EST). Despite the difference in sexuality, the MTFs' hypothalamic networks activated in response to AND, like the androphilic female control groups. Both groups experienced amygdala activation in response to EST. Male control groups (gynephilic) experienced hypothalamic activation in response to EST. However, the MTF subjects also experienced limited hypothalamic activation to EST as well. The researchers' conclusion was, that in terms of pheromone activation, MTF's occupy an intermediate position with predominantly female features.[17] The MTF transsexual subjects had not undergone any hormonal treatment at the time of the study, according to their own declaration beforehand, and confirmed by repeated tests of hormonal levels.

**Transsexuality among twins**  
In a 2013 study based on previously published research and conducted surveys it was found that in 39 coming from a single fertilized egg, monozygotic twin male pairs, 13 (33%) identified both of themselves as transsexual. This was found in 8 of 25 (22.5%) female pairs. Alternatively only 1 out of 38 (2.6%) coming from different fertilized eggs, dizygotic male and female pairs identified themselves as transsexual. The significant percentage of transsexual identification in both of the identical twins, and the virtual absence of this correspondence in dizygotic twins raised in the same family at the same time, supports the argument that one's transsexual identity is significantly influenced by genetics.

**Prenatal androgen exposure**  
Prenatal androgen exposure, the lack thereof, or poor sensitivity to prenatal androgens are commonly cited mechanisms to explain the above discoveries. Schneider, Pickel, and Stalla (2006) found a correlation between digit ratio (a generally accepted marker for prenatal androgen exposure) and male to female transsexualism. MTF transsexuals were found to have a higher digit ratio than control males, but one that was comparable to control females.",2016-03-01 22:46:37+00:00,d0jyde6,1.0,t3_48hs1g,16315.0,asktransgender

[Transgender: Evidence on the biological nature of gender identity](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/02/150213112317.htm)

Genetics  
The androgen receptor (AR), also known as NR3C4, is activated by the binding of testosterone or dihydrotestosterone, where it plays a critical role in the forming of primary and secondary male sex characteristics. Hare et al. found that male-to-female transsexuals were found to have longer repetitions of the gene, which reduced its effectiveness at binding testosterone.

A variant genotype for a gene called CYP17, which acts on the sex hormones pregnenolone and progesterone, has been found to be linked to female-to-male transsexualism but not MTF transsexualism. Most notably, the FTM subjects not only had the variant genotype more frequently, but had an allele distribution equivalent to male controls, unlike the female controls. The paper concluded that the loss of a female-specific CYP17 T -34C allele distribution pattern is associated with FtM transsexualism.

Brain structure  
In a first-of-its-kind study, Zhou et al. (1995) found that in a region of the brain called the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTc), a region known for sex and anxiety responses, MTF transsexuals have a female-normal size while FTM transsexuals have a male-normal size. While the transsexuals studied had taken hormones, this was accounted for by including non-transsexual male and female controls who, for a variety of medical reasons, had experienced hormone reversal. The controls still retained sizes typical for their gender. No relationship to sexual orientation was found.

In a follow-up study, Kruijver et al. (2000) looked at the number of neurons in BSTc instead of volumes. They found the same results as Zhou et al. (1995), but with even more dramatic differences. One MTF subject who had never gone on hormones was also included, and who matched up with the female neuron counts nonetheless.

In 2002, a follow-up study by Chung et al. found that significant sexual dimorphism (variation between sexes) in BSTc did not become established until adulthood. Chung et al. theorized that either changes in fetal hormone levels produce changes in BSTc synaptic density, neuronal activity, or neurochemical content which later lead to size and neuron count changes in BSTc, or that the size of BSTc is affected by the failure to generate a gender identity consistent with one's anatomic sex.

In a review of the evidence in 2006, Gooren confirms the earlier research as supporting the concept that transsexualism is a sexual differentiation disorder of the sex dimorphic brain. Dick Swaab (2004) concurs.

In 2008, a new region with properties similar to that of BSTc in regards to transsexualism was found by Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab: the interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH3), part of the hypothalamic uncinate nucleus. The same method of controlling for hormone usage was used as in Zhou et al. (1995) and Kruijver et al. (2000). The differences were even more pronounced than with BSTc; control males averaged 1.9 times the volume and 2.3 times the neurons as control females, yet once again, regardless of hormone exposure, MTF transsexuals lay within the female range and the FTM transsexual within the male range.

While the resolution of MRI tomographs in general can be fine enough, independent nuclei are not visible due to lack of contrast between different neurological tissue types. Therefore, such images do not show detailed structures such as BSTc and INAH3, and studies on BSTC were done by bisecting brains postmortem.

However, MRI does much more easily allow the study of larger brain structures. In Luders et al. (2009), 24 MTF transsexuals not-yet treated with cross-sex hormones were studied via MRI. While regional gray matter concentrations were more similar to men than women, there was a significantly larger volume of gray matter in the right putamen compared to men. As with many earlier studies, they concluded that transsexualism is associated with a distinct cerebral pattern.

An additional feature was studied in a group of FTM transsexuals who had not yet received cross-sex hormones: fractional anisotropy values for white matter in the medial and posterior parts of the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), the forceps minor, and the corticospinal tract. Rametti et al. (2010) discovered that, ""Compared to control females, FtM showed higher FA values in posterior part of the right SLF, the forceps minor and corticospinal tract. Compared to control males, FtM showed only lower FA values in the corticospinal tract.""

Hulshoff Pol et al. (2006), studied the gross brain volume of subjects undergoing hormone treatment. They discovered that whole brain volume for subjects changes toward the size of the opposite sex during hormone treatment. The conclusion of the study was, ""The findings suggest that, throughout life, gonadal hormones remain essential for maintaining aspects of sex-specific differences in the human brain.""

Brain plasticity  
Brain structure differences associated with transsexualism do not exist in isolation. Similar brain structure differences have been noted between gay and heterosexual men, and between lesbian and heterosexual women.

More recent studies have found that circumstance and repeated activities such as meditation modify brain structures in a process called brain plasticity or neuroplasticity. In May 2014, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reported that parenting ""rewires the male brain"" for fathers.

Brain function  
Phantom limb syndrome is a common, often painful experience after the loss of an external organ. Ramachandran (2008) found that while nearly two thirds of non-transsexual males who have a penis surgically removed experience the sensation of a phantom penis, only one third of MTF transsexuals do so after sex reassignment surgery. This study, however, overlooks the differences between an amputation, where the nerves connecting the penis and the brain are severed, and male-to-female gender reassignment surgery, where some of the penis and scrotum may be reused to create a vaginal canal, labia and a clitoris. In this case, some of the nerves connecting the new genitalia to the brain remain largely intact. Also, two-thirds of FTM transsexuals reported the sensation of a phantom penis from childhood onwards, complete with phantom erections and other phenomena.

Berglund et al. (2008) tested the response of gynephilic MTF transsexuals to two sex pheromones: the progestin-like 4,16-androstadien-3-one (AND) and the estrogen-like 1,3,5(10),16-tetraen-3-ol (EST). Despite the difference in sexuality, the MTFs' hypothalamic networks activated in response to AND, like the androphilic female control groups. Both groups experienced amygdala activation in response to EST. Male control groups (gynephilic) experienced hypothalamic activation in response to EST. However, the MTF subjects also experienced limited hypothalamic activation to EST as well. The researchers' conclusion was, that in terms of pheromone activation, MTF's occupy an intermediate position with predominantly female features.[17] The MTF transsexual subjects had not undergone any hormonal treatment at the time of the study, according to their own declaration beforehand, and confirmed by repeated tests of hormonal levels.

Transsexuality among twins  
In a 2013 study based on previously published research and conducted surveys it was found that in 39 coming from a single fertilized egg, monozygotic twin male pairs, 13 (33%) identified both of themselves as transsexual. This was found in 8 of 25 (22.5%) female pairs. Alternatively only 1 out of 38 (2.6%) coming from different fertilized eggs, dizygotic male and female pairs identified themselves as transsexual. The significant percentage of transsexual identification in both of the identical twins, and the virtual absence of this correspondence in dizygotic twins raised in the same family at the same time, supports the argument that one's transsexual identity is significantly influenced by genetics.

Prenatal androgen exposure  
Prenatal androgen exposure, the lack thereof, or poor sensitivity to prenatal androgens are commonly cited mechanisms to explain the above discoveries. Schneider, Pickel, and Stalla (2006) found a correlation between digit ratio (a generally accepted marker for prenatal androgen exposure) and male to female transsexualism. MTF transsexuals were found to have a higher digit ratio than control males, but one that was comparable to control females.",2016-02-27 22:53:36+00:00,d0g95c1,6.0,t1_d0g5jwg,6240.0,politics

Abortion is the ending of pregnancy by removing a fetus or embryo before it can survive outside the uterus. An abortion which occurs spontaneously is also known as a miscarriage. An abortion may be caused purposely and is then called an induced abortion, or less frequently, ""induced miscarriage"". The word abortion is often used to mean only induced abortions. A similar procedure after the fetus could potentially survive outside the womb is known as a ""late termination of pregnancy"".

5894,"You DO realize that what you're quoting comes from McHugh's article in the Wall Street Journal? His biased and dangerous misrepresentation of evidence on transgender people was called out by prominent members of the American Psychiatric Association in a rebuttal letter to the Journal, as was his flagrant misuse of a 2011 study on outcomes for post-operative transgender people by Dr. Celia Dhejne. His deliberate misinterpretation of the 2011 study led Dr. Dhejne to publicly denounce McHugh’s actions as “unethical.”

 JHU’s Dr. Cynthia Osborne has been a witness in at least three cases in which transgender people were seeking health care. She says prisoners should never receive gender-confirmation surgery. As a result of her testimony, all three inmates lost their cases, and two of them resorted to self-castration out of desperation.

The university’s Dr. Chester Schmidt has also been a star for defendants who wish to ignore standards of care. Schmidt testified that he has never recommended transgender surgery out of the 300 transgender patients he's had. During his testimony, Schmidt stated (against WPATH standards of care) that the correct course of treatment for gender dysphoria is, in his opinion, “psychotherapy and medication.” Schmidt has availed himself of right-wing news outlets to make a case that transgender people should not be given affirming care.

The study McHugh ran in the late 1970s was deeply flawed and biased, having been designed to get a particular answer. As a result, the psychiatric community no longer considers this study persuasive or credible. Fellow psychiatry staff member Dr. Thomas Wise has also espoused similarly outdated, offensive views on transgender people, including a belief that transgender people need reparative therapy, and not affirming medical care.  

And you want to quote studies??? There are far more studies that show that transitioning alleviates dysphoria.

[ After gender reassignment, in young adulthood, the GD was alleviated and psychological functioning had steadily improved. ](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958.abstract)

[Allowing Transgender Youth To Transition Improves Their Mental Health, Study Finds](http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2015/03/10/3631788/letting-transgender-kids-transition-is-for-their-own-good/)

[Heylans et al., 2014](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12363/abstract): ""A difference in SCL-90 [a test of distress, anxiety, and hostility] overall psychoneurotic distress was observed at the different points of assessments (P = 0.003), with the most prominent decrease occurring after the initiation of hormone therapy (P &lt; 0.001)...Furthermore, the SCL-90 scores resembled those of a general population after hormone therapy was initiated.""

[Colizzi et al., 2013](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12155/abstract): ""At enrollment, transsexuals reported elevated CAR ['cortisol awakening response', a physiological measure of stress]; their values were out of normal. They expressed higher perceived stress and more attachment insecurity, with respect to normative sample data. When treated with hormone therapy [at followup, 1 year after beginning HRT], transsexuals reported significantly lower CAR (P &lt; 0.001), falling within the normal range for cortisol levels. Treated transsexuals showed also lower perceived stress (P &lt; 0.001), with levels similar to normative samples.""

[Gomez-Gil et al., 2012](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21937168): ""SADS, HAD-A, and HAD-Depression (HAD-D) mean scores [these are tests of depression and anxiety] were significantly higher among patients who had not begun cross-sex hormonal treatment compared with patients in hormonal treatment (F=4.362, p=.038; F=14.589, p=.001; F=9.523, p=.002 respectively). Similarly, current symptoms of anxiety and depression were present in a significantly higher percentage of untreated patients than in treated patients (61% vs. 33% and 31% vs. 8% respectively).""

de Vries, et al., 2014 studied 55 trans teens from the onset of treatment in their early teenage years through a follow-up an average of 7 years later. They found no negative outcomes, no regrets, and in fact their group was slightly mentally healthier than non-trans controls.

[Lawrence, 2003](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1024086814364) surveyed post-op trans folk: ""Participants reported overwhelmingly that they were happy with their SRS results and that SRS had greatly improved the quality of their lives. None reported outright regret and only a few expressed even occasional regret.""

5956,"in 2014 ultraconservative Islamic groups railed against an international beauty contest until the government ordered it to be staged entirely on the Hindu resort island of Bali. In 2012, radical Islamic groups known for their violent tactics and religious conservatives raised enough of a fuss that Lady Gaga canceled a concert in the Indonesian capital. And hundreds of local governments in recent years have passed rules on morality and dress inspired by Shariah, or Islamic law, and instituted bans on alcohol.

according to a cross-national study on religious restrictions published by Pew in September 2012, Indonesia was actually one of the world’s most religiously restrictive states. Specifically, Indonesia was one of only five out of the 49 Muslim-majority countries in the world to register “very high” ratings in both metrics used in the study – government restrictions on religion and social hostilities involving religion. The other four countries were Afghanistan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Yemen – hardly good company in this respect.

*Sauce: http://www.pewforum.org/2012/09/20/rising-tide-of-restrictions-on-religion-findings/

Across Indonesia, religious minorities, including Christians and Shia Muslims, have increasingly been harassed, threatened and attacked by Sunni Islamist militant groups like the Islamic Defenders Front. Indonesia’s Setara Institute, which monitors religious freedom in the country, recorded 220 cases of violent attacks on religious minorities in 2013, an increase from 91 such cases in 2007. 

i've seen shit like this since the 70's, because i grew up in Singapore, and believe me, i read everything that went on there, and had many of my indonesian friends tell me about the goings on there.

[Transgender: Evidence on the biological nature of gender identity](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/02/150213112317.htm)

Genetics  
The androgen receptor (AR), also known as NR3C4, is activated by the binding of testosterone or dihydrotestosterone, where it plays a critical role in the forming of primary and secondary male sex characteristics. Hare et al. found that male-to-female transsexuals were found to have longer repetitions of the gene, which reduced its effectiveness at binding testosterone.

A variant genotype for a gene called CYP17, which acts on the sex hormones pregnenolone and progesterone, has been found to be linked to female-to-male transsexualism but not MTF transsexualism. Most notably, the FTM subjects not only had the variant genotype more frequently, but had an allele distribution equivalent to male controls, unlike the female controls. The paper concluded that the loss of a female-specific CYP17 T -34C allele distribution pattern is associated with FtM transsexualism.

Brain structure  
In a first-of-its-kind study, Zhou et al. (1995) found that in a region of the brain called the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTc), a region known for sex and anxiety responses, MTF transsexuals have a female-normal size while FTM transsexuals have a male-normal size. While the transsexuals studied had taken hormones, this was accounted for by including non-transsexual male and female controls who, for a variety of medical reasons, had experienced hormone reversal. The controls still retained sizes typical for their gender. No relationship to sexual orientation was found.

In a follow-up study, Kruijver et al. (2000) looked at the number of neurons in BSTc instead of volumes. They found the same results as Zhou et al. (1995), but with even more dramatic differences. One MTF subject who had never gone on hormones was also included, and who matched up with the female neuron counts nonetheless.

In 2002, a follow-up study by Chung et al. found that significant sexual dimorphism (variation between sexes) in BSTc did not become established until adulthood. Chung et al. theorized that either changes in fetal hormone levels produce changes in BSTc synaptic density, neuronal activity, or neurochemical content which later lead to size and neuron count changes in BSTc, or that the size of BSTc is affected by the failure to generate a gender identity consistent with one's anatomic sex.

In a review of the evidence in 2006, Gooren confirms the earlier research as supporting the concept that transsexualism is a sexual differentiation disorder of the sex dimorphic brain. Dick Swaab (2004) concurs.

In 2008, a new region with properties similar to that of BSTc in regards to transsexualism was found by Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab: the interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH3), part of the hypothalamic uncinate nucleus. The same method of controlling for hormone usage was used as in Zhou et al. (1995) and Kruijver et al. (2000). The differences were even more pronounced than with BSTc; control males averaged 1.9 times the volume and 2.3 times the neurons as control females, yet once again, regardless of hormone exposure, MTF transsexuals lay within the female range and the FTM transsexual within the male range.

While the resolution of MRI tomographs in general can be fine enough, independent nuclei are not visible due to lack of contrast between different neurological tissue types. Therefore, such images do not show detailed structures such as BSTc and INAH3, and studies on BSTC were done by bisecting brains postmortem.

However, MRI does much more easily allow the study of larger brain structures. In Luders et al. (2009), 24 MTF transsexuals not-yet treated with cross-sex hormones were studied via MRI. While regional gray matter concentrations were more similar to men than women, there was a significantly larger volume of gray matter in the right putamen compared to men. As with many earlier studies, they concluded that transsexualism is associated with a distinct cerebral pattern.

An additional feature was studied in a group of FTM transsexuals who had not yet received cross-sex hormones: fractional anisotropy values for white matter in the medial and posterior parts of the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), the forceps minor, and the corticospinal tract. Rametti et al. (2010) discovered that, ""Compared to control females, FtM showed higher FA values in posterior part of the right SLF, the forceps minor and corticospinal tract. Compared to control males, FtM showed only lower FA values in the corticospinal tract.""

Hulshoff Pol et al. (2006), studied the gross brain volume of subjects undergoing hormone treatment. They discovered that whole brain volume for subjects changes toward the size of the opposite sex during hormone treatment. The conclusion of the study was, ""The findings suggest that, throughout life, gonadal hormones remain essential for maintaining aspects of sex-specific differences in the human brain.""

Brain plasticity  
Brain structure differences associated with transsexualism do not exist in isolation. Similar brain structure differences have been noted between gay and heterosexual men, and between lesbian and heterosexual women.

More recent studies have found that circumstance and repeated activities such as meditation modify brain structures in a process called brain plasticity or neuroplasticity. In May 2014, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reported that parenting ""rewires the male brain"" for fathers.

Brain function  
Phantom limb syndrome is a common, often painful experience after the loss of an external organ. Ramachandran (2008) found that while nearly two thirds of non-transsexual males who have a penis surgically removed experience the sensation of a phantom penis, only one third of MTF transsexuals do so after sex reassignment surgery. This study, however, overlooks the differences between an amputation, where the nerves connecting the penis and the brain are severed, and male-to-female gender reassignment surgery, where some of the penis and scrotum may be reused to create a vaginal canal, labia and a clitoris. In this case, some of the nerves connecting the new genitalia to the brain remain largely intact. Also, two-thirds of FTM transsexuals reported the sensation of a phantom penis from childhood onwards, complete with phantom erections and other phenomena.

Berglund et al. (2008) tested the response of gynephilic MTF transsexuals to two sex pheromones: the progestin-like 4,16-androstadien-3-one (AND) and the estrogen-like 1,3,5(10),16-tetraen-3-ol (EST). Despite the difference in sexuality, the MTFs' hypothalamic networks activated in response to AND, like the androphilic female control groups. Both groups experienced amygdala activation in response to EST. Male control groups (gynephilic) experienced hypothalamic activation in response to EST. However, the MTF subjects also experienced limited hypothalamic activation to EST as well. The researchers' conclusion was, that in terms of pheromone activation, MTF's occupy an intermediate position with predominantly female features.[17] The MTF transsexual subjects had not undergone any hormonal treatment at the time of the study, according to their own declaration beforehand, and confirmed by repeated tests of hormonal levels.

Transsexuality among twins  
In a 2013 study based on previously published research and conducted surveys it was found that in 39 coming from a single fertilized egg, monozygotic twin male pairs, 13 (33%) identified both of themselves as transsexual. This was found in 8 of 25 (22.5%) female pairs. Alternatively only 1 out of 38 (2.6%) coming from different fertilized eggs, dizygotic male and female pairs identified themselves as transsexual. The significant percentage of transsexual identification in both of the identical twins, and the virtual absence of this correspondence in dizygotic twins raised in the same family at the same time, supports the argument that one's transsexual identity is significantly influenced by genetics.

Prenatal androgen exposure  
Prenatal androgen exposure, the lack thereof, or poor sensitivity to prenatal androgens are commonly cited mechanisms to explain the above discoveries. Schneider, Pickel, and Stalla (2006) found a correlation between digit ratio (a generally accepted marker for prenatal androgen exposure) and male to female transsexualism. MTF transsexuals were found to have a higher digit ratio than control males, but one that was comparable to control females.",2016-02-11 22:43:41+00:00,czwlfe2,6.0,t1_czwhqs3,4957.0,politics

6066,"you can watch this dynamic any weekend if you go to the stands of any university football game. Students prefer beer, but most college stadiums don't allow or sell any alcohol. It's a zone of prohibition. So what do the students do? They smuggle in hard liquor in flasks.

The technical term for this — coined by the advocate for drug reform Richard Cowan — is “the iron law of prohibition.” As crackdowns on a drug become more harsh, the milder forms of that drug disappear — and the most extreme strains become most widely available.

Most cannabis smokers don't want to get totally baked on super skunk, any more than most social drinkers want to get smashed on Smirnoff. But the milder stuff isn't available because the market is prohibited.

The iron law is playing out to devastating effect with opiates. People who become addicted to OxyContin or Percocet want to continue using those drugs. Doctors, however, are required by law to stop prescribing these opiates if they suspect the patient is feeding an addiction, not treating physical pain. Yet when an addict tries to find his drug on the illegal market, Oxy or Percs are almost impossible to get. What is widely available, and cheaper, is a much stronger and completely outlawed opiate: heroin.

[Transgender: Evidence on the biological nature of gender identity](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/02/150213112317.htm)

Genetics  
The androgen receptor (AR), also known as NR3C4, is activated by the binding of testosterone or dihydrotestosterone, where it plays a critical role in the forming of primary and secondary male sex characteristics. Hare et al. found that male-to-female transsexuals were found to have longer repetitions of the gene, which reduced its effectiveness at binding testosterone.

A variant genotype for a gene called CYP17, which acts on the sex hormones pregnenolone and progesterone, has been found to be linked to female-to-male transsexualism but not MTF transsexualism. Most notably, the FTM subjects not only had the variant genotype more frequently, but had an allele distribution equivalent to male controls, unlike the female controls. The paper concluded that the loss of a female-specific CYP17 T -34C allele distribution pattern is associated with FtM transsexualism.

Brain structure  
In a first-of-its-kind study, Zhou et al. (1995) found that in a region of the brain called the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTc), a region known for sex and anxiety responses, MTF transsexuals have a female-normal size while FTM transsexuals have a male-normal size. While the transsexuals studied had taken hormones, this was accounted for by including non-transsexual male and female controls who, for a variety of medical reasons, had experienced hormone reversal. The controls still retained sizes typical for their gender. No relationship to sexual orientation was found.

In a follow-up study, Kruijver et al. (2000) looked at the number of neurons in BSTc instead of volumes. They found the same results as Zhou et al. (1995), but with even more dramatic differences. One MTF subject who had never gone on hormones was also included, and who matched up with the female neuron counts nonetheless.

In 2002, a follow-up study by Chung et al. found that significant sexual dimorphism (variation between sexes) in BSTc did not become established until adulthood. Chung et al. theorized that either changes in fetal hormone levels produce changes in BSTc synaptic density, neuronal activity, or neurochemical content which later lead to size and neuron count changes in BSTc, or that the size of BSTc is affected by the failure to generate a gender identity consistent with one's anatomic sex.

In a review of the evidence in 2006, Gooren confirms the earlier research as supporting the concept that transsexualism is a sexual differentiation disorder of the sex dimorphic brain. Dick Swaab (2004) concurs.

In 2008, a new region with properties similar to that of BSTc in regards to transsexualism was found by Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab: the interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH3), part of the hypothalamic uncinate nucleus. The same method of controlling for hormone usage was used as in Zhou et al. (1995) and Kruijver et al. (2000). The differences were even more pronounced than with BSTc; control males averaged 1.9 times the volume and 2.3 times the neurons as control females, yet once again, regardless of hormone exposure, MTF transsexuals lay within the female range and the FTM transsexual within the male range.

While the resolution of MRI tomographs in general can be fine enough, independent nuclei are not visible due to lack of contrast between different neurological tissue types. Therefore, such images do not show detailed structures such as BSTc and INAH3, and studies on BSTC were done by bisecting brains postmortem.

However, MRI does much more easily allow the study of larger brain structures. In Luders et al. (2009), 24 MTF transsexuals not-yet treated with cross-sex hormones were studied via MRI. While regional gray matter concentrations were more similar to men than women, there was a significantly larger volume of gray matter in the right putamen compared to men. As with many earlier studies, they concluded that transsexualism is associated with a distinct cerebral pattern.

An additional feature was studied in a group of FTM transsexuals who had not yet received cross-sex hormones: fractional anisotropy values for white matter in the medial and posterior parts of the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), the forceps minor, and the corticospinal tract. Rametti et al. (2010) discovered that, ""Compared to control females, FtM showed higher FA values in posterior part of the right SLF, the forceps minor and corticospinal tract. Compared to control males, FtM showed only lower FA values in the corticospinal tract.""

Hulshoff Pol et al. (2006), studied the gross brain volume of subjects undergoing hormone treatment. They discovered that whole brain volume for subjects changes toward the size of the opposite sex during hormone treatment. The conclusion of the study was, ""The findings suggest that, throughout life, gonadal hormones remain essential for maintaining aspects of sex-specific differences in the human brain.""

Brain plasticity  
Brain structure differences associated with transsexualism do not exist in isolation. Similar brain structure differences have been noted between gay and heterosexual men, and between lesbian and heterosexual women.

More recent studies have found that circumstance and repeated activities such as meditation modify brain structures in a process called brain plasticity or neuroplasticity. In May 2014, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reported that parenting ""rewires the male brain"" for fathers.

Brain function  
Phantom limb syndrome is a common, often painful experience after the loss of an external organ. Ramachandran (2008) found that while nearly two thirds of non-transsexual males who have a penis surgically removed experience the sensation of a phantom penis, only one third of MTF transsexuals do so after sex reassignment surgery. This study, however, overlooks the differences between an amputation, where the nerves connecting the penis and the brain are severed, and male-to-female gender reassignment surgery, where some of the penis and scrotum may be reused to create a vaginal canal, labia and a clitoris. In this case, some of the nerves connecting the new genitalia to the brain remain largely intact. Also, two-thirds of FTM transsexuals reported the sensation of a phantom penis from childhood onwards, complete with phantom erections and other phenomena.

Berglund et al. (2008) tested the response of gynephilic MTF transsexuals to two sex pheromones: the progestin-like 4,16-androstadien-3-one (AND) and the estrogen-like 1,3,5(10),16-tetraen-3-ol (EST). Despite the difference in sexuality, the MTFs' hypothalamic networks activated in response to AND, like the androphilic female control groups. Both groups experienced amygdala activation in response to EST. Male control groups (gynephilic) experienced hypothalamic activation in response to EST. However, the MTF subjects also experienced limited hypothalamic activation to EST as well. The researchers' conclusion was, that in terms of pheromone activation, MTF's occupy an intermediate position with predominantly female features.[17] The MTF transsexual subjects had not undergone any hormonal treatment at the time of the study, according to their own declaration beforehand, and confirmed by repeated tests of hormonal levels.

Transsexuality among twins  
In a 2013 study based on previously published research and conducted surveys it was found that in 39 coming from a single fertilized egg, monozygotic twin male pairs, 13 (33%) identified both of themselves as transsexual. This was found in 8 of 25 (22.5%) female pairs. Alternatively only 1 out of 38 (2.6%) coming from different fertilized eggs, dizygotic male and female pairs identified themselves as transsexual. The significant percentage of transsexual identification in both of the identical twins, and the virtual absence of this correspondence in dizygotic twins raised in the same family at the same time, supports the argument that one's transsexual identity is significantly influenced by genetics.

Prenatal androgen exposure  
Prenatal androgen exposure, the lack thereof, or poor sensitivity to prenatal androgens are commonly cited mechanisms to explain the above discoveries. Schneider, Pickel, and Stalla (2006) found a correlation between digit ratio (a generally accepted marker for prenatal androgen exposure) and male to female transsexualism.

Evidence suggests that people who identify with a gender different from the one they were assigned at birth may do so not just due to psychological or behavioral causes, but also biological ones related to their genetics, the makeup of their brains, or prenatal exposure to hormones.

The DSM-IV-TR diagnostic component of distress is not inherent in the cross-gender identity; rather, it is related to social rejection and discrimination suffered by the individual. Psychology professor Darryl Hill insists that gender dysphoria is not a mental disorder, but rather that the diagnostic criteria reflect psychological distress in children that occurs when parents and others have trouble relating to their child's gender variance.

6303,"Historically, we were indeed considered mentally ill. The DSM (used in the US) recently declassified us as a 'disorder', but the ICD (used in much of the rest of the world) continues to classify us as a paraphilic disorder (essentially, a fetish). It's worth pointing out, however, that the ICD didn't declassify homosexuality as a disorder until the 90s (in fact, they did so in the current version of the ICD), two decades after the DSM declassified it. It also classifies the vast majority of the population as sex disordered, since things like enjoying kinky sex are disordered by the ICD's standards. The current draft of the upcoming new ICD edition also declassifies us as mentally ill, following the DSM's example.

But I would say we are not disordered, for three primary reasons: one, we show some basis in fact for our identification; two, unlike true delusional or somatoform disorders (which seem the most obvious comparison), psychiatric medication does not affect our feelings; and three, unlike true delusional/somatoform disorders, allowing us to pursue our feelings is far from destructive and in fact has exceptionally well-demonstrated positive results.

As best we can tell, gender identity is at least partially determined by brain structure formed very early in fetal development. A few studies show patterns typical of our identified gender and not of our birth sex.

Moreover, transgenderism correlates strongly with endocrine conditions - if we look at people born with externally female bodies, those with PCOS (which raises testosterone) are much more likely to ultimately identify as men; those with CAIS (which makes their bodies incapable of responding to testosterone) almost never do, to the point that single cases merit publication in their own right. On top of that, digit ratio (a marker of prenatal testosterone exposure) displays markedly low T exposure on average in trans women and high T exposure in trans men.

There's even some experimental evidence that, when cis (=not trans) people are categorized contrary to their birth sex, they experience the same distress that trans people do. Under the assumption that gender is malleable to social expectations, David Reimer was raised as a girl after a botched circumcision. He found himself uncomfortable with the female role, displayed symptoms typical of what would be expected of a trans man (that's FTM, to be clear), and ultimately transitioned to living as a man as soon as he became aware of his status in his early teens. And on the flip side, an author named Norah Vincent spent a year living as a man for the purposes of writing a book. By the end of that time, she was so depressed she checked herself into a mental institution because she was worried she might harm herself.

Additionally, trans feelings simply don't respond to psychiatric medication designed to 'cure' them. No professional organization in the world - even those that do classify us as a mental illness for (I feel) mostly historical/political reasons - recommends just giving us SSRIs or the like and sending us away. Traditional therapies simply do not work.

Compare this with Body Dysmorphic Disorder, a disorder that could be seen as an analog to trans people. BDD sufferers fixate on a small (e.g., a mole) or nonexistent part of their bodies, which they believe makes them hideous and unlovable. Some seek out treatment to remove the offending part. But BDD, unlike trans people, responds well to both therapy and SSRIs and does not respond to their desired interventions.",2016-01-30 20:16:30+00:00,czhuuum,4.0,t1_czhu5cp,1301.0,TwoXChromosomes

Position Statement on Access to Care for Transgender and Gender Variant Individuals (2012)  
 The American Psychiatric Association:  
1. Recognizes that appropriately evaluated transgender and gender variant individuals can benefit greatly from medical and surgical gender transition treatments.  
2. Advocates for removal of barriers to care and supports both public and private health insurance coverage for gender transition treatment.  
3. Opposes categorical exclusions of coverage for such medically necessary treatment when prescribed by a physician.

Position Statement on Discrimination Against Transgender and Gender Variant Individuals
(2012)  
 Being transgender gender or variant implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities; however, these individuals often experience discrimination due to a lack of civil rights protections for their gender identity or expression… Thus, this position statement is relevant to the APA because discrimination and lack of equal civil rights is damaging to the mental health of  transgender and gender variant individuals.  

**The American Psychiatric Association:**  
1. Supports laws that protect the civil rights of transgender and gender variant individuals.  
2. Urges the repeal of laws and policies that discriminate against transgender and gender variant individuals.  
3. Opposes all public and private discrimination against transgender and gender variant individuals in such areas as health care, employment, housing, public accommodation, education, and licensing.  
4. Declares that no burden of proof of such judgment, capacity, or reliability shall be placed upon these individuals greater than that imposed on any other persons.

Transgender and Gender Identity Issues Policy Statement (2008)
 NASW supports the rights of all individuals to receive health insurance and other health coverage without discrimination on the basis of gender identity, and specifically without exclusion of services related to transgender or transsexual transition…in order to receive medical and mental health services through their primary care physician and the appropriate referrals to medical specialists, which may include hormone replacement therapy, surgical interventions, prosthetic devices, and other medical procedures.

**World Professional Association for Transgender Health**  
Clarification on Medical Necessity of Treatment, Sex Reassignment, and Insurance Coverage in the U.S.A. (2008)  
WPATH found that decades of experience with the Standards of Care show gender transitions and related care to be accepted, good medical practice and effective treatment.  
In a 2008 clarification, WPATH stated:

[S]ex reassignment, properly indicated and performed as provided by the Standards of Care, has proven to be beneficial and effective in the treatment of individuals with transsexualism, gender identity disorder, and/or gender dysphoria. Sex reassignment plays an undisputed role in contributing toward favorable outcomes, and comprises Real Life Experience, legal name and sex change on identity documents, as well as medically necessary hormone treatment, counseling, psychotherapy, and other medical procedures...


The medical procedures attendant to sex reassignment are not ‘cosmetic’ or ‘elective’ or for the mere convenience of the patient. These reconstructive procedures are not optional in any meaningful sense, but are understood to be medically necessary for the treatment of the diagnosed condition.

**National Commission on Correctional Health Care**


Position Statement: Transgender Health Care in Correctional Settings (2009) 

The health risks of overlooking the particular needs of transgender inmates are so severe that acknowledgment of the problem and policies that assure appropriate and responsible provision of health care are needed….  
Because prisons, jails, and juvenile justice facilities have a responsibility to ensure the physical and mental health and well-being of transgender people in their custody, correctional health staff should manage these inmates in a manner that respects the
biomedical and psychological aspects of a gender identity disorder (GID) diagnosis.

6392,"According to Britain's National Health Service, the definition of Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD), or body dysmorphia, is an anxiety disorder that causes sufferers to spend a lot of time worrying about their appearance and to have a distorted view of how they look.

Their definition of Gender Dysphoria is ""a condition where a person experiences discomfort or distress because there is a mismatch between their biological sex and gender identity...This mismatch between sex and gender identity can lead to distressing and uncomfortable feelings that are called gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is a recognised medical condition, for which treatment is sometimes appropriate. **It is not a mental illness.**""

Those who suffer from body dysmorphia have a disconnection between the reality they are perceiving and how that perception is recognised in their brains. They look in an ordinary mirror, but for them, the result is something like we might imagine a funhouse mirror to look. There is an inability to recognise the body for what it is. Features seem distorted, and flaws (real or imagined) are perceived as much much worse than they are (if they even exist, and if they're even flaws in the first place). No one is really sure why this misperception develops.

A great many individuals with gender dysphoria are considered perfectly well-adjusted, the stressors of gender dysphoria being comparable to other stressors associated with any serious medical condition.

&gt;The correct answer to this is best summarized as 'sort of but not really'.
&gt;
Here's a direct quote from the DSM 5:
&gt;
DSM-5 aims to avoid stigma and ensure clinical care for individuals who see and feel themselves to be a different gender than their assigned gender. It replaces the diagnostic name “gender identity disorder” with “gender dysphoria,” as well as makes other important clarifications in the criteria. It is important to note that gender nonconformity is not in itself a mental disorder. The critical element of gender dysphoria is the presence of clinically significant distress associated with the condition

6407,"In 2013, Gender Dysphoria replaced the diagnosis of Gender Identity Disorder in the DSM. The APA explained that ""Replacing 'disorder' with 'dysphoria' in the diagnostic label is not only more appropriate and consistent with familiar clinical sexology terminology, it also removes the connotation that the patient is 'disordered.'"" The APA said it was concerned that completely 'removing the condition as a psychiatric diagnosis--as some had suggested--would jeopardize access to care... Many of the treatment options for this condition include counseling, cross-sex hormones, gender reassignment surgery, and social and legal transition to the desired gender. To get insurance coverage for the medical treatments, individuals need a diagnosis.""",2016-01-30 04:10:57+00:00,czh8vqi,2.0,t1_czh8ruo,236.0,TwoXChromosomes

many people choose to take at least some steps to bring their physical appearance in line with how they feel inside. They might change the way they dress or go by a different name. They may also take medicine or have surgery to change their appearance.

Puberty blockers -- A young person in early puberty with gender dysphoria might ask to be prescribed hormones (testosterone or estrogen) that would suppress physical changes. Before making that decision, the young person should talk with a pediatrician and sometimes a psychiatrist about the pros and cons of taking these hormones, especially at a young age.

Hormones – Teens or adults may take the hormones estrogen or testosterone to develop traits of the sex that they identify with.

That's not true, plenty of us know we're trans, and while counseling is always recommended, it isnt necessary. Which is why informed consent clinics like Planned Parenthood exist.

&gt;Unfortunately, males seeking hormones aren't interested in anybody's advice

Since you didnt know, trans men also exist.

&gt; As much as we all love instant gratification, changing your gender seems worthy of a little counseling, in my opinion.

Right, and you think doctors would risk their licenses to satisfy that need for instant gratification. When you go to an informed consent clinic like Planned Parenthood, the doctors fully brief you on the risks and side effects of hormones, and there are always followup visits.

(Adopted 1974; reviewed and reaffirmed 1980; revised 1986, 1993, 1999, 2002, 2008, 2014)

American School Counselor Association (ASCA) Position
School counselors recognize their primary obligation for confidentiality is to the student but balance that obligation
with an understanding of the family or guardians’ legal and inherent rights to be the guiding voice in their children’s
lives (ASCA Code of Ethics, 2010, A.2.d).

The Rationale  
ASCA members affirm their belief in the individual’s worth and dignity (ASCA, 2010, A.1.a). It is the school counselors’
responsibility to fully respect the right to privacy of those with whom they enter a counseling relationship and
to provide an atmosphere of trust and confidence (Glosoff &amp; Pate, 2002; Lazovsky, 2008; Welfel, 2002).

Confidentiality is an ethical term denoting a counseling practice relevant to privacy. A student who has a counseling
relationship with a school counselor has the right to privacy and the promise of confidentiality. Exceptions to confidentiality
exist, and students should be informed that situations arise in which school counselors must inform others
of information obtained in counseling relationships in order to protect students themselves or others. Privileged communication
between a school counselor and a student is a legal term granting privilege to a counseling relationship
only if said “privilege” is granted by federal or state statue. If “privilege” applies it can provide additional safeguards
to confidential information.",2016-01-29 05:30:10+00:00,czg36wm,26.0,t1_czg2wvk,601.0,politics

Gender dysphoria can be extremely uncomfortable to some children, and social transition is the fastest way to alleviate that discomfort. The suicide rate among trans people hovers at around 40%, which is almost ten times the national average.

It basically boils down to whether or not you want your child to survive long enough to get to puberty. Any parent who truly loves their child without condition would choose to let them transition.",2016-01-27 11:52:48+00:00,czdqk9q,2.0,t1_czdqgmw,375.0,politics

6567,"Heya fellow Singaporean! (you're like the fourth trans girl from Singapore that  i know)

And while i'm a lot older than you(43), i'm pretty sure my experiences are similar enough, Singapore really hasnt changed all that much :-p

My parents felt the same way yours did, and that's why i pushed it for as long as i did, i only came out at 39, because i refused to hit 40 as a boy. And my parents reacted as you would expect conservative, bible-thumpers would. They told me to go find a therapist to help me stay a boy. My sister couldnt accept it either, although she did tell my nephews something, so they dont use pronouns when they talk to me, which is a start, i guess?

Well, at 39 i could pretty much ignore that advice, especially since i had moved to the States and hadnt been back for 20 years. I keep sending them articles to read about transition, but they're not having it, they now deadname me even tho they used to call me Drewie all thru childhood.

NS was hard, i'm not going to lie, basic training was rough, officer cadet school was worse. You could try declaring that you're trans to the army doctors, and they'll downgrade you so you dont go thru regular basic training. I used to be an officer in BMT, and i regularly had batches of trans girls that we had to oversee who were separate from the ""regulars"". i THINK it's a PES F designation, but the rules might have changed since i was there.

As for your therapist, have you tried bringing up the WPATH standards of care? It lays out the recommended treatments for trans people, and there's a section on it for minors.

If you want to talk to someone who has been through it before, feel free to PM me.

6656,"In 2001, Portugal became the first European country to abolish all criminal penalties for personal drug possession. In addition, drug users were to be provided with therapy rather than prison sentences. Research commissioned by the Cato Institute and led by Glenn Greenwald found that in the five years after the start of decriminalisation, illegal drug use by teenagers had declined, the rate of HIV infections among drug users had dropped, deaths related to heroin and similar drugs had been cut by more than half, and the number of people seeking treatment for drug addiction had doubled.

&amp;nbsp;

(1997-1999) ""The figures for cannabis use among the general population reveal the same pictures. The Netherlands does not differ greatly from other European countries. In contrast, a comparison with the US shows a striking difference in this area: 32.9% of Americans aged 12 and above have experience with cannabis and 5.1% have used in the past month. These figures are twice as high as those in the Netherlands."" - See more at: http://www.drugwarfacts.org/cms/Netherlands_v_US#sthash.U4DK1Djv.dpuf

&amp;nbsp;

In 2009, Mexico took a similar step by decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of heroin, cocaine, marijuana, LSD, and methamphetamine.

&amp;nbsp;

 In the near future, Ireland will decriminalize marijuana, cocaine, and heroin possession. Medically-supervised injection rooms will also soon be available to drug users, in order to reduce the stigma of addiction.

&amp;nbsp;

In Colombia and Peru, cocaine possession and cultivation is legal. The drug is decriminalized in Switzerland and Germany. Both countries permit cocaine for medical use, as do the U.K, Hong Kong, and **Singapore**. Heroin is similarly permitted for medical purposes in Canada, Hong Kong, the Netherlands, and the U.K. Brazil could also decriminalize all drug possession in the near future.

I'll give you an example, i had the same performance issues, and with my girlfriends, i always ended up going down on them. Which considering i'm a lesbian, makes a whole lot of sense in retrospect.

And that thing with the porn? Yup, had that too. I used to get dressed up in slutty outfits and go on marathon wank sessions while watching porn. That's the testosterone talking.

And as for ""trying out"" hrt? I'll quote both my therapist and yoda, ""Do or do not, there is no try."" HRT for a monh isnt going to do squat. You need a few years for it to fully take effect. HRT is a commitment.

And the last part, if you ask me, a trans person, if i think you'e trans? Of course i do, because i see similarities in your life that mirror my experiences.

6790,"lol, never confuse fiction with real life, because real life is always way more complicated. The one thing i'll say is that the time Lili lived in didnt have any language for trans people, so she had to put it in terms that she thought of.

Like for me, there are distinct times in my life, when i was perceived as and treated like a male, the inbetweeny transition period, and now when i'm perceived as and treated like a female. If i didnt have language for it, i might call the inbetweeny part the ""war"" between my boy and girl sides. 

Again, transition is different for each of us, but for me, it was the relaxing of my mannerisms that might be described as ""feminine"". I guess you could say that the ""girl"" slowly took over from the ""boy"". 

But imagine Lili doing it on her own, who no guidance from those who had gone before. she could feel Einar slipping further and further away, it'd be really scary. Heck, it's terrifying for us and we HAVE resources and a history to reference about how it's going to go.

And a lightbulb went on in my head, and i thought, ""oh, i can switch to being a girl!"" Of course, that was immediately followed by ""But all the boys in school will make fun of me!"" So i stayed in the closet for the next 32 years.

Like you, i buried myself in work and i managed to push the girl away for periods, but she would always leak out. I used to crossdress all the time, that was my outlet. I also self-medicated for a long period of time with drugs and alcohol, battling with anxiety and depression. 

 And coming out was a freaking emotional rollercoaster, the pure joy and happiness of not having to hide anymore, the fear of what was to come next, the massive self-dohbt of whether i had done the right thing. But that first shot of estrogen after months and months of therapy? That was what did it for me. That was the point that i knew for sure, mostly because that represented the point of no return for me. And i havent looked back since.

But here's the thing about asking ""Am i trans?"" on a sub like this, you'll invariably see similarities in our experieces that could ""confirm"" your suspicion. That's why rule 1 around these parts is always ""Get thee to a gender therapist"" (if you can)

Cisgender (often abbreviated to simply cis) describes related types of gender identity perceptions, where individuals' experiences of their own gender agree with the sex they were assigned at birth.

and from the DSM V

In the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), people whose gender at birth is contrary to the one they identify with will be diagnosed with gender
dysphoria. This diagnosis is a revision of DSM-IV’s criteria for gender identity disorder and is intended to better characterize the experiences of affected children, adolescents, and adults.

7128,"&gt; So you're bringing a vastly disproportionate strength to a physically aggressive sport for women

The Women’s Flat Track Derby Association (WFTDA) unveiled a gender policy which aimed to improve upon the Stockholm Consensus. The Stockholm Consensus governs Olympic competition and requires that athletes have undergone hormone replacement therapy for at least two years, obtained legal recognition of a gender change, and went through sexual reassignment surgery. Under the WFTDA policy, players would only need to meet a hormone requirement. 

Surgeons and doctors have also argued that after two years of feminizing hormone treatment, the bodies of trans women do not confer a competitive advantage over cisgender (or non-trans) women.

and quoting from the link /u/Yveris posted to the thread /u/DGunner had the other day

&gt;""Treatment aimed at trying to change a person's gender identity and expression to become more congruent with sex assigned at birth has been attempted in the past without success (Gelder &amp; Marks, 1969; Greenson, 1964), particularly in the long term (Cohen-Kettenis &amp; Kuiper, 1984; Pauly, 1965).

7211,"&gt; Can someone please help me understand why gender dysphoria is treated with surgery rather than counseling? 

Gender dysphoria is treated with many things, counselling, hormones, and sometimes surgery are all a part of transition. But i assume your question falls more along the line of, ""why dont you get therapy to help you stay the gender you were assigned at birth?"" Well, they've tried, over many years, and with many different people, and it turns out you cant change the mind to suit the body, you can only change the body to suit the mind. 

One of the more famous cases is that of Bruce and Brian Reimer 

http://www.bbc.com/news/health-11814300http://www.bbc.com/news/health-11814300

They tried to raise Bruce as a girl, it didnt work. 

And as far as your previous posts about children undergoing transition, around two-years-old, children become conscious of the physical differences between boys and girls. Before their third birthday, most children are easily able to label themselves as either a boy or a girl. By age four, most children have a stable sense of their gender identity.

And the treatment for children with gender dysphoria is to be put on puberty suppressing hormones to delay the onset of puberty. There are always exceptions, because everybody's body is different. I know of some cases where the doctors have started children on hormone replacement therapy as early as 12.

7225,"Section 377 of the penal code in 42 former British colonies criminalizes anal sex between men and other homosexual acts. The provision was introduced by British colonial authorities in the British Raj as section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, and was used as the model for sodomy laws in many other British colonies, in many cases with the same section number.

In Singapore, it use to read as follows: ""Whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animals, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine.""

Section 377A was introduced into the Singapore Penal Code in 1938 to criminalise all other non-penetrative sexual acts between men.

it reads as follows: ""Any male person who, in public or private, commits, or abets the commission of, or procures or attempts to procure the commission by any male person of, any act of gross indecency with another male person, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years.""

Owing to overwhelming public support and the realisation by the politico-legal system that the statute was no longer relevant to contemporary society, Section 377 was repealed in October 2007...

Section 377A is still on the books.

anyways, as i was telling /u/monkeyswithgunsmum, i grew up in a strict methodist family, went to an all boys christian school, went to bible camp 10 summers straight. that christian upbringing made me stay so deep in the closet, i was going down on girls in Narnia. 

i didnt come out til i was 39, so you are way, WAY ahead of me. that being said, being out is one of the most freeing things that has ever happened to me.

In the U.S., there are two different categories of public accommodations:

Privately-owned/operated businesses and buildings
Government-owned/operated facilities and services. Government-owned facilities include courthouses, jails, hospitals, parks, and other places owned and operated by federal, state and local government. Government-operated services, programs, or activities provided by federal, state, or local governments include transportation systems and government benefits programs.

Privately-owned/operated businesses and buildings. Privately-owned businesses and facilities that offer certain goods or services to the public -- including food, lodging, gasoline, and entertainment -- are considered public accommodations for purposes of federal and state anti-discrimination laws. For purposes of disability discrimination, the definition of a ""public accommodation"" is even more broad, encompassing most businesses that are open to the public (regardless of type).

i might have to steal that one.

I'll add my two sents here, for what it's worth.

We discuss every controversial post and we dont remove threads, or ban people,  lightly. When we do, you can be sure that we've discussed it among ourselves before doing it. 

and yes, sometimes it comes down to a judgement call, and we usually err on the side of caution. now that may not sit well with some people, but like i said, we play it really safe.

there are always subs like /r/ainbow or /r/transspace if you want a REALLY open discussion. lord knows i've got into one or two of those in my time.

the reason we try to keep it as neutral as possible is because there are so many of us at VERY different points in our transition. not everyone has had time to thicken their skin to take the slings and arrows of outrageous bigotry and discrimination(apologies to the 'Bard for paraphrasing)

we only ask for a little understanding so that we can bring along the baby transies and give them a chance to grow.

that's not to say that the older transitioners cant get anything out of this sub, because they are free to ask questions too. And we can have a civil discussion even with the restrictions we place on ourselves. there's always a different way of phrasing things so that we dont end up attacking each other.

the community is small enough, we dont want us fighting with each other.

so again, all we ask is for a little patience and understanding",2015-10-14 04:03:05+00:00,cvz245q,8.0,t1_cvz135o,1908.0,asktransgender

Here are a few studies, although far from all that exist on the subject:

[Heylans et al., 2014](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12363/abstract): ""A difference in SCL-90 [a test of distress, anxiety, and hostility] overall psychoneurotic distress was observed at the different points of assessments (P = 0.003), with the most prominent decrease occurring after the initiation of hormone therapy (P &lt; 0.001)...Furthermore, the SCL-90 scores resembled those of a general population after hormone therapy was initiated.""

[Dhejne, et al.](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016885) is much-cited by those who like to say that we have elevated mortality post-transition, and it does in fact say this...for the cohort who transitioned before 1989, in a far more hostile world and with less effective treatments. However, there was not a significant elevation of suicide or of other mortality in the post-1989 cohort.

[Colizzi et al., 2013:](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12155/abstract) ""At enrollment, transsexuals reported elevated CAR ['cortisol awakening response', a physiological measure of stress]; their values were out of normal. They expressed higher perceived stress and more attachment insecurity, with respect to normative sample data. When treated with hormone therapy [at followup, 1 year after beginning HRT], transsexuals reported significantly lower CAR (P &lt; 0.001), falling within the normal range for cortisol levels. Treated transsexuals showed also lower perceived stress (P &lt; 0.001), with levels similar to normative samples.""

[Gomez-Gil et al., 2012](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21937168): ""SADS, HAD-A, and HAD-Depression (HAD-D) mean scores [these are tests of depression and anxiety] were significantly higher among patients who had not begun cross-sex hormonal treatment compared with patients in hormonal treatment (F=4.362, p=.038; F=14.589, p=.001; F=9.523, p=.002 respectively).

Unlike the previous links, it's not peer-reviewed, but the large sample size provides some corroboration of the above results. In particular, we have: (Page 15): ""Stage of transition had a substantial impact upon life satisfaction within the sample. 70% of the participants stated that they were more satisfied with their lives since transition, compared to 2% who were less satisfied (N=671)"" (Page 50): "" Most participants who had transitioned felt that their mental health was better after doing so (74%), compared to only 5% who felt it was worse (N=353)."" (Page 55): ""For participants who had transitioned, this had led to changes in their self-harming. 63% felt that they harmed themselves more before they transitioned, with only 3% harming themselves more after transition (N=206)."" (Page 59): ""Suicidal ideation and actual attempts reduced after transition, with 63% thinking about or attempting suicide more before they transitioned and only 3% thinking about or attempting suicide more post-transition. 7% found that this increased during transition, which has implications for the support provided to those undergoing these processes (N=316).""

[de Vries, et al., 2014](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958.abstract) studied 55 trans teens from the onset of treatment in their early teenage years through a follow-up an average of 7 years later. They found no negative outcomes, no regrets, and in fact their group was slightly mentally healthier than controls.

[Lawrence, 2003](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1024086814364) surveyed post-op trans folk: ""Participants reported overwhelmingly that they were happy with their SRS results and that SRS had greatly improved the quality of their lives.

7575,"You might want to check your sources.

Each U.S. state (and the District of Columbia) has its own age of consent. Currently state laws set the age of consent at 16, 17, or 18. The most common age is 16.

https://www.age-of-consent.info/

Anything under that age and the individual in question is not an adult and therefore cannot give consent.

In Europe, countries who have the age of consent set at 16 include Cyprus, Finland, Georgia, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, and Switzerland.

For Austria, Germany, Portugal and Italy it is 14, and in France, the Czech Republic, Denmark, and Greece it is 15.

Spain did have one of the lowest ages of consent on the continent at just 13, but recently agreed to raise this to 16.

Throughout the rest of the world, there are big variations.

In Bahrain, it is set at 21 for women who want to marry without their father's consent, while in nearby Saudi Arabia, all sex outside of marriage is illegal but there are no laws limiting the age at which you can get married.

In China, the age of consent is 14, in Iraq it is 18, while in Japan it is five years lower at 13.

The likes of Brazil, Peru, Paraguay, Ecuador and Colombia all have it set at 14.

And in some countries - such as Chile -  the minimum age of consent is 14, but there are legal restrictions on sexual activities up to the age of 18, and homosexual sex is illegal before that age.

Australia's age of consent varies between 16 and 17 depending on which territory you are in.

In Angola, the age of consent is just 12, but sex with someone between 12 and 17 can be prosecuted under sex abuse.

as for your scenario, it would depend on where the person is prosecuted. in that case, that age of consent for that particular state or country is used.",2015-10-08 20:36:07+00:00,cvswssr,8.0,t1_cvswavg,709.0,atheism

so let's try that again, shall we?

Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), or body dysmorphia, is an anxiety disorder that causes sufferers to spend a lot of time worrying about their appearance and to have a distorted view of how they look.

Gender dysphoria is a condition where a person experiences discomfort or distress because there is a mismatch between their biological sex and gender identity...This mismatch between sex and gender identity can lead to distressing and uncomfortable feelings that are called gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is a recognised medical condition, for which treatment is sometimes appropriate. **It is not a mental illness**.

7811,"&gt; It...is...a...dysmorphia.

no, it isnt Eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia are part of a condition called ""Body Dysmorphic Disorder."" In short, Body Dysmorphic Disorder, or BDD, is a disorder in which your perception of your body does not align with reality. People with BDD are caught up in a cycle of obsessive thoughts about one or more parts of their body which they believe to be noticeably flawed--the word ""dysmorphia"" itself means ""malformation."" Eating disorders fall under the BDD umbrella. Someone with an eating disorder, then, perceives a part or parts of their body to be overweight, and the obsession over that fact pushes them into a disordered relationship with food.

Transgender people, on the other hand, are diagnosed by the most recent Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM V) with gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is not a disorder, and is now recognized not as a condition, but as a symptom. The word ""dysphoria"" means a sense of restlessness, anxiety, dissonance, or distress, and is the linguistic opposite of a sense of euphoria. Trans people experience this sense of distress when they contemplate the difference between the reality of their body, and the way they believe their body should be in order to align with their sense of self.

So, to sum up, body dysmorphia causes someone to believe their body is a certain way, while gender dysphoria is a sense that the body should be a different way. People with BDD are not able to see the difference between the way their body is and the way other people see their body; transgender folks are uncomfortably able to see the way their body really is, and the way that reality conflicts with their internal experience of their gender.

&gt; The first link you cited states that the best course of action in treatment is changing their sex....okay? That doesn't mean we aren't treating a mental disorder with surgery.

if it was mental, they'd treat the mind, not the body

&gt; It literally validates the claim that the condition is a genetic disorder. It cites that transexuals have a gene mutation which causes a longer androgen receptor to form.

genetic, as in biological, as in NOT mental

&gt;Using your logic....Down Syndrome people are an ethnicity because they have a genetic condition....do you understand the disconnect in your logic?

There is increasing evidence of a biological basis for gender identity that may change physicians' perspective on transgender medicine and improve health care for these patients.

7941,"Scientists and Religion in America by Edward J. Larson and Larry Witham

Science and religion are engaging in moreactive dialogue and debate, but a survey suggests that scientists’ beliefs have changed little since the 1930s, and top scientists are more atheistic than ever before.

And what does the typical scientist hope and believe? An early pioneer who sought to answer that question was Bryn Mawr College psychologist James H. Leuba. In 1914 and again in 1933 Leuba surveyed American biological and physical scientists on their views regarding what he described as “the two central beliefs of the Christian religion...""

To see if scientists’ beliefs had changed since his day, in 1996 and in 1998 we again asked American scientists Leuba’s two questions

Do you believe in (1) “a God in intellectual and affective communication with man… to whom one may pray in expectation of receiving an answer” and (2) “personal immortality.” Yes, no, and don’t know or agnostic were the only options offered. Responses were strictly anonymous.
Four in 10 of Leuba’s scientists believed in God as defined in his survey. The same is true today. Somewhat more, about 50 percent, held to an afterlife in Leuba’s day, but now that figure is also 40 percent.

At the top is acute disbelief. Scientists in the middle are significantly less believing (by more than half) than citizens in general. The wide and heavy base is more firmly sunken into religious America—evidence suggests that there is more personal religion among physicians, engineers and members of other technological occupations that involve applied science.

This might be where the &gt;90% number comes from, refering to the top scientists in the US however, Paul Conkin made an interesting observation in his book.

“Today the higher the educational attainment, or the higher the scores earned on intelligence or achievement tests, the less likely are individuals to be Christians,” notes intellectual historian Paul K. Conkin. He could say the same of higher income, too.",2015-09-12 19:12:53+00:00,cuz8ro7,10.0,t1_cuz7eai,2368.0,news

Crime Follows Poverty Because: 

• Low-income and African American communities have a higher percentage of adult males behind bars (and many for drug or lesser crimes than whites). That means fewer fathers, grandfathers and mentors for young men to look up to. Without a stable father figure, young men are more likely to follow the paths of their father.

• The ""war on drugs"" has traditionally targeted low-income, minority communities where many street dealers live instead of the often white and well-to-do suppliers.

• A criminal record reduces one's opportunities for employment; thus, they are more likely to turn to crime again.

• A neighborhood's goals and values are reflected in the amount of crime that occurs. ""Neighborhoods and Violent Crime: A Multilevel Study of Collective Efficacy"" by Robert J. Sampson, Stephen W. Raudenbush and Felton Earls, published in Science magazine in 1997, found that the ability of communities to obtain resources and public services correlates with the signs of disorder. For example, the fewer resources a community has to invest into their homes, the more likely it is to find vacant houses, vandalism and burned-out buildings—conditions that breed crime.",2015-09-06 22:59:03+00:00,cuswlvv,4.0,t1_cuswjru,124.0,politics

Once you fall into that cycle, it's difficult to break out. When people get out of jail, they usually have no money or a stable home to return to. So right now, if you are African American, the chances that you will be incarcerated are even higher. Studies show that people resort to crime only if they determine that potential benefits outweigh the cost or consequences of committing that. Therefore, people living in poverty are more likely to commit burglary, larceny or theft.",2015-09-06 22:53:38+00:00,cuswg9n,6.0,t1_cusw7da,503.0,politics

The only jobs available were low end, blue collar work. (sound familiar yet?) 70% of servants in Boston were Irish immigrants.

* Bostonians believed that the Irish were a servant race.

* Bostonians called their Irish female servants the ""bridgets"" or ""biddys"" and the males ""paddys"". Many Irish named their children after the two popular Catholic saints, but the names at that time carried derisive connotations

* Bostonians derisively monikered potatoes ""murphies""

* Irish servants were noted to be full of melancholy and loneliness

* Irish women suffered from high levels of mental illness, as a result, by 1908, there were more Irish than there were any other nationality in a mental hospital

* Established working class America resented the Irish laborers who would work for anything

* Employers would place signs with NINA scrawled across the front. NINA spelled out is No Irish Need Apply, this would often be seen next to the No Dogs Allowed signs.

* In the 1870's &amp; 80's, Irishman were portrayed on stage and in caricatures as bumbling, idiots, erratic, pugnacious drunks

8165,"welp, i guess i'm up. my hrt consists only of estrogen, i WAS prescribed Dutastaride as an AA, but my T levels were basically non-existent to begin with, so i really didnt need it. the estrogen was enough to stop whatever t production i had. i like to joke that i was already halfway to bitch before hrt.

1. yes, but essentially, ymmv.

2. again, ymmv, my T actually spiked when i started, which, as my endo told me, meant that the testes took as a sign that they were failing, so for a brief shining moment, they kick into overdrive. but as time went on, the body adjusts to the new normal, and slowly shutdown down production. 

3. ymmv, depends on how much of a testosterone factory you are. that's why there's no ""one standard dose"" for hrt. every body is different. so you have to do blood tests to check on your levels. as far as sexy times? that too is a ymmv. i know some trans girls who have normal sexual function (usually because of the progesterone) but for me? i was already asexual, so my sex drive was nonexistent to begin with.

4. everyone has estrogen and testosterone in their body. 

but just a heads up, boobs are inevitable, even for a late transitioner like me, i still grew boobies. granted i'm at a tanner stage II size, but they're recognizable boobs. 

oh and the other side effect of shutting down T production? you get tired REAL fast. and you start losing muscle.

look, there's no one way to be trans.each person's journey is unique. when psychs ask questions like that, they're just trying to get an idea of what your journey has been, and how best to proceed. it's been said that we often find out who we are simply by talking about ourselves. there's something about verbalizing it that makes it real. like looking in the mirror one day and instead of saying ""i'm a girl, i'm a girl, i'm a girl"" to convince yourself, it becomes ""I'M A GIRL!"" in affirmation.

you be a girl however it is you want to be. nobody can take away who you are. all the transphobes in the world can point to me and call me a man, it will never be true. you go be you.

the diagnosis of dysphoria isnt just something that is done lightly. children have to show consistent, persistent, and insistent occurrences of gender dysphoria.

and the treatment for that is counselling, and hormone blockers given to delay puberty. 

to delay giving treatment WOULD be to do harm. there is nothing wrong with buying some time for people, kids, to figure things out. and there are some of us who DO know at a very early age.

it's not like a kid walks into a doctor's office, says that they're trans and the next moment they're on a gurney with an orderly pumping psychiatric meds thru an IV. first off, there's a lot of talking, like a whole boatload, and then puberty blockers when the time is right. and when the doctor can be sure that the patient can make a decision, then either they stop taking blockers and puberty happens naturally, or they go on HRT, that's pretty much it.

and what age were you when you started questioning your gender? i'm just trying for a baseline here.

&gt; diagnosed with mental illness at that age

usually it's a doctor that does that

&gt; it's not even really a medical issue.

well, thankfully, most medical professionals disagree with you

&gt; Gender is not like skin color that's so clear and objective.

and there are some who know, i did when i was 7, i knew i wasnt a boy, even tho everybody around me told me i was. i KNEW. and other do too. 

&gt;To already label a five-year-old as gender dysphoric is trouble.

no, no it isnt

&gt;We should stop medicalizing everything and give things time to develop and the person to mature enough before we jump in with solving problems that may not be problems in the first place

you DO realize that the treatment for gender dysphoria is counselling, yes? and hormone blockers specifically to give them more time

the first time i saw my therapist for dysphoria, one of the first things she told me when i told her all the things keeping me from transitioning was that i had ""Other People's Disease"" So she asked me, if i could do it all over, and none would be the wiser, which gender would i choose to do it in, and i chose female without any hesitation. and as soon as i heard myself say that, i knew i had to transition. it stooped being something i could push off. transition became a need

also, hi emma, i'm drewie. i'm a mod around here, which basically means i get to make sure that threads dont explode into massive flamewars with transies dueling at twenty paces with drawn needles. (note to self, file away for possible future reality tv show)

it's perfectly normal to be scared, i knew when i was 7, but i was so terrified that i pushed it away til i was 39. like many of us, i was in the army, tried to man up that way, (didnt work, couldja tell?) after i came out, i was scared to see my therapist. after i saw my therapist, i was scared to go see her in girlmode(that was one of the challenges she gave me), i was scared when i got my endo letter, took me 3 months before i made an appointment. if you're scared, it's ok, lots and lots of us were.

as for the lose-lose scenario? ehhhhhh.. not so much. you'll see that once you take steps to transition, you start chipping away at that big block of troubles that's been bugging you. if you look at the entirety of transition, of everything you have to do, of course it'll be overwhelming. you have to take it one step at a time. that's why this sub exists, because there are transies at every stage of transition who can help by sharing their experiences to people like you.

8452,"well, if you've lurked here for any amount of time, you'll know that the first piece of advice would be to make an appointment with a gender therapist. you see, we tend to carry a certain bias, being trans and all, so reading your post, we carry a ""Are They Trans?"" checklist that we mark off as we go, and we're pretty generous with those ""YES"" boxes.

have you answered the button test yet? if i gave you a button that if you pressed, would instantly make you female. *poof* and in the mind of your friends and family, you were born that way, so all their prior memories would be of you AS a female. would you press it? bearing in mind that this is a one way ticket. if you press it, there'd be no going back. would you?

if you, like the girls here, lunge at that button and mash it for all you're worth, then yeah, i'd say that you're probably trans. because, all things being equal, if you desire to be female that badly and the only thing that's holding you back is what other people would think of you? then you have your answer. because you'll find that what other people think doesnt matter as much as who you are. and if who you are is female, then yes, you should come out and transition. 

happiness will only come if we are true to ourselves.

i know it's hard, and some of us struggle with it for a loooooooooong time. hell, i pushed it til i was 39, and i've known since i was 7. denial, aint jes a river in egypt. but coming out was the best thing i did for my sanity, because lemme tell you, i was one depressed ass poodle. my problems didnt disappear overnight, and it took months of therapy, but i am way, WAY happier now than i ever was pre-transition.

i hope that helped, if in no other way than to share my own story of how it went for me. oh and that checklist? i had many of the same ones you do.

Hell, i pass for a tall cis girl, but for those at work who know i'm trans, i get the gendered comments like, ""you're pretty direct, totally like a boy"". jeez, i must have missed that meeting that everybody decided that girls could be direct.

a lot of the girls want to look like the models in the magazines, and on tv. not all of us will achieve that. not many cis girls do either. welcome to planet girl, where we fight impossible standards on a daily basis. we should get a dang cookie for putting up with that shit.

you're not doing this alone, we're ALL here for you. and dont you dare tell me that internet friend support doesnt count, some of my best friends came from reddit, hell, i met my partner on here and we're married now.(she's trans too, so's our other girlfriend who we also met on here)

i've been where you are, so i know exactly how you feel. i know how hard it is just to get out of bed, how hard it is to do ANYTHING. all i can say is that it does get better. not right away, but slowly. each day that went by made it a little easier to deal, each day brought a little glimmer of hope. and there are times when i regressed, and i'd see the worst case senario and fall into a really bad depression.

honeslty, even tho you said that you and your therapist figured out that transitioning wasnt for you, you could always go back to them and tell them that you're still questioning your gender and see what they say or suggest.

First off, your body is adjusting to running off new hormones, it's going to feel uncomfortable for a bit. and because everyone's body is different, we all adjust to it differently.

So here's what my endo told me about the first few doses, that your body will see the influx of estrogen as a sign that the testicles are failing, and it will signal your gonads to kick into overdrive, i.e. to produce MORE testosterone. after a few more shots, your body will interpret that as the new normal, and send a signal to shut down the production of T.

EVERYTHING was hard for me and i found myself questioning my sanity on a daily basis. but even then, i knew there was no going back for me. i tried being the boy everybody told me i was. but deep down inside, i knew i was a girl. and deep down inside, i think you know it too, i think a LOT of us know that. hang on, this will pass.

and one thing i know is that you are NOT alone, we're all here for you.",2015-06-21 18:56:48+00:00,cse0lyf,1.0,t3_3am6r5,9411.0,asktransgender
8691,"Well, seeing a therapist is always a good first step, that's the one thing we always stress in all the trans subs. we tend to have a certain bias toward that kind of question, one that almost invariably leads to a positive answer. 

that being said, certain aspects of your story are extremely similar to mine. growing up, i always used to sneak into my sister's room and try on her clothes. they just felt soooooooo good to try on, and it made me very happy.

of course that led to a looooooooooooong period of buying and purging women's clothes. even in the army, i always had an  item or two stashed away.

it was always JUST enough, to wear the clothes whenever i got those ""urges"". but eventually, the need to be a girl became too great. i had to face the fact that i wasnt, in fact, a crossdresser, that i was, in fact, just a girl.

that was kind of a hard fact to reconcile with myself, especially with me being 42. but, as with all things in life, facts have a funny way of being true, regardless of how you, or anyone else, feels about them. 

and the fact of the matter, was that i AM a girl. Nothing on god's green earth can change that.

go see your therapist, if nothing else, telling someone else and sharing that secret you've had for so long is extremely liberating. you'll feel a weight lift off, sounds hokey, i know, but when i told my therapist, it was SUCH a feeling of relief. a secret like that weighs you down, and it just gets heavier and heavier, but it does so gradually, so you dont really notice til it's lifted. 

see your therapist, i hope you find your answer there. and please, always feel free to come here to share. you might also want to post in /r/asktransgender, or go read thru the posts there. you'll find lots of stories similar to yours. you're not alone, there are plenty of us who share the same stories.",2015-06-21 15:56:53+00:00,csdv9sb,1.0,t3_3aljoq,14738.0,TransSpace

8700,"well, the first thing i'd say is for you to bring this up with a therapist. 

now that the disclaimer is out of the way...

that button test we all go on about, you know, the one where we press it and hey change-o presto, you get to wake up the next day and be a girl? guess what, you can press it at any time. just in your case, you wake up in a girl's body that's 6'3"" and 273 pounds. and in so doing, you get to join the party of trans girls, and girls in general, bemoaning the fact that we dont look like supermodels. congratulations! here's a cookie.

look, it's not easy for us, but we transition because we're trans, and we're NOT the gender we were assigned at birth. we dont transition to fit into society's assumption of some arbitrary standard of what constitutes a female. 

that fear of what other people will think holds so many of us back, and that fear is often what drives so many of us to attempt suicide, some of us, multiple times.

go make an appointment with a gender therapist, it'll help more than you think. and dont forget, we'll always be here for you.
