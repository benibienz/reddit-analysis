Then Two gunslingers with deadeye and celestial nighthawk shoot the tethered omnigul with GG and they should kill her. Run raze lighter/solar shotguns if GG doesn't finish her off.

23,"To be honest, I'm not too sure how it is going to increase the sound of the cars given they are already straight pipe exhaust systems, it does depend on how the cars have the exhaust/wastegate set up now, if it is a short pipe, that vents out of the body work before the rear of the car, that should provide an increase in volume, how much, I'm not too sure.

In terms of venting sounds, I do recall when I went to Australian GP in 2014 the Ferrari engine cars releasing all the turbo pressure and hearing that quite clearly. Where it went I don't know, but it wasn't an atmospherically vented sound. This being F1, exhaust gas and sounds are energy, and F1 teams want to harvest as much of that as they can. If teams are using the wastegates gasses now to reroute in the system, then yeah we are going to see a volume increase.

It shouldn't do at all. at least I dont think it will, given that the wastegate just controls boost pressure, where the MGU-H works of the turbocharger shaft which connects the two sides of it. Unless teams were using the excess exhaust gasses to supply to this unit, I don't think it will make a difference. ",2015-10-01 10:46:04+00:00,cvkcxtu,4,t1_cvkclzs,1389,formula1
24,"The wastegate is used to release extra boost in the exhaust system before it hits the turbine side of the turbo charger. In it's basic configuration, it remains closed until the pressure in the system reaches a certain point (usually the load rating of wastegate spring) and then it opens. They are used to control the boost level at a maximum point. I.E. if the spring is rated to 1 Bar of boost. they will open as soon as it goes to +1.0 Bar.   

In most commercial vehicles this is built into the turbochargers housing. Some performance or modified cars use an external wastegate, which is placed before the turbine. and the exit port of the wastegate is routed back into the exhaust system flowing out the back of the car.

Some cars however, run an external wastegate which vents to atmosphere. Essentially this is pressurised exhaust gasses venting straight to atmosphere with no muffler. The result is a stupidly loud pipe that only comes on song when the wastegate opens (when the turbo is on boost). This can be referred to as a 'screamer pipe'.

They're fundamental to any turbocharger system from my understanding, as there will be boost spikes resulting in damage to the ICE. ~~So I do imagine the F1 cars use this quite frequently in cohorts with an actual electronic boost controller. Probably even from low rpms, to make sure the boost comes on in a linear fashion to increase drivability~~

EDIT 2: The MGU-H does the equivalent of a wastegates job. And the teams just run wastegates as precautionary measure if the MGU-H fails. That makes this a stupid rule.

To the second part: Come off it. It's Red Bulls budget that makes them a threat, nothing to do with their drivers or their car.

Uncertainty over the future means that the heads at the drinks company will probably reduce expenses for RBR, that means less R&amp;D, less staff, less chassis upgrades etc.

43,"One of the fastest drivers on the grid, arguably the best over one lap. Watch his pole lap at Singapore in 2013 and you will see why. 

I think he was humbled by 2014, kind of brought him back down to Earth after the highs of 2010-2013. From youngest ever champion, and 4 of them in a row to not knowing if he'd see the chequered flag. Ricciardo coming in and laying down some impressive performances coupled by Vettel's poor reliability in the opening part of the calendar seemed to really disinterest him. I think he gave up on 2014 around Canada. 

Reinvigorated by his Ferrari move has breathed new life into him. He's developing into a character that is absolutely menacing when the helmet goes on.

3 drivers lead the rankings in terms of performance. Alonso, Hamilton and Vettel. And there is no set order among them. They could all out perform each other on their day.

If people think he is a poor driver after one bad season. I suspect they are just not fans of the sport. He is one of the greatest drivers of the modern era, his success only polarises people since it came so quickly in such large amounts where it seemed at times that the underdog (Alonso in 2012) arguably deserved it more.

At the end of the day. He still had to go out a put that car on pole 45 times, take 41 victories, 73 Podiums, 24 fastest laps in 150 Grand Prix. All at the age of 28.
