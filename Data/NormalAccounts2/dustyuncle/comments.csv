This article is a write up of the 60 Minutes special on last night. I definitely recommend everyone to watch the video in the article. It is disgusting. 

Essentially the day you become a congressman, the RNC tells you to spend 4 hours a day, 30 hours a week on raising campaign funds for all congressmen (they all have to do it). They must hit at least $18,000 a DAY or will get sanctions. 

Before the invention of Super PACs they only had to spend a few hours a week. But because these 100 million dollar + Super PACs are so prevalent, the only way to compete is to create a RNC of DNC war chest of their own.

1441,"I work in tech and hire software engineers.

1. It is really difficult to find coders who 1. have experience and 2. are willing to stick at the job, 3. work for a reasonable salary. (clarify, using h1-b to artificially decrease wages is WRONG)

2. When looking outside silicon valley, it is way way more difficult to find techs. So while it may be bad in CA, it is really hard to find them in TX.

3. We also graduate 5000?x the amount of Business Management majors every year than there are available management positions. Does this mean we should ban everyone who doesn't have that major or from any other country to be a manager? It's similar logic to H1-B but even more severe than that.

Trump is taking a reasonable position. Tech companies need skilled workers both inside and outside. Now he won't stand for corruption but he's willing to negotiate on H1-B. if he says no more H1-B's our tech industry will crumble because people in america just don't like working software engineer jobs. Sure we have tons of people studying it (i did) but I absolutely hate coding.

Also, if we don't allow H1-B, we'll just continue to hire those people outside the US, it's not going to solve the problem. But at least we can bring these bright people here. 

Overall, Trump is willing to negotiate, it's important. If we Trust Trump with other issues, then we can support him with this one as well. ",2016-03-04 04:20:07+00:00,d0mz39e,1.0,t3_48vro3,359.0,The_Donald

In 1980, the Economy was in shambles, Military was falling apart with 50 hostages in iran. That year Americans  had 2 choices for president.

The second alternative, was a twice-married Hollywood actor, who as Governor of California signed the most liberal abortion bill in California history and who's wife followed astrology and used it to influence him. His name was Ronald Regan. Guess who the Evangelicals went for? They went for Ronald Reagan, not because he was the most religious candidate but he had the quality that is most important, leadership.

2126,"I would take the Product Management job in a heart beat in your shoes. It's one of the top growing and satisfying jobs out there right now. I usually say it's like consulting without the need to travel (great for families). You will be in a rare field with limitless opportunity and only getting more important. 

I said in an earlier reply I spend about 25% of my day on PM work, 25% on customer communication, and 50% on projects I've come up with on my own or taken from others (to get visibility and get things done). Meetings will always be there because you are the middle manager that is making the day to day decision on strategic vision. Take pride in that, it's a lot of responsibility and has a large impact.

I think the position naturally goes into a COO type role and I think that's where I want to go. I have a fantastic CEO right now and I think when we grow 2-3x (in 2 years) I should have enough experience by doing what I do now (PM work, plus Project work, plus working with clients) that I should be able to get that kind of role.

Second, if you want to be a heavy lifter, then learn to code. But you won't be determining direction, which is where the true value of a PM is at.

I like PM a lot, I get to make the big design decisions, sit in the meetings with top brass, but at the same time can get in dirty with the devs and make sure they're doing what they're supposed to be doing.

I think in your case, you should look for a smaller company as you'll be able to be a product manager, a project manager, a support, a COO, and a bad DBA. It's fun and you should get stock as well. Just keep honing your skills for that opportunity.

Another comment, when I am doing my PM work, I maybe spend 25% my day on that work, the rest of the time I'm talking with customers directly in NIHITO visits (nothing important happens in the office). I spend the other 50% of the day taking on projects that are just sitting there or I create them myself with a ""let's just get it done"" attitude.

2138,"&gt; What products/type have you launched ?

Started in Travel and launched a few hotel related products, including the normal routine stuff as well as UX redesign, and expansions in our current product offering.  I was junior to a very experienced Director and VP of PM, so I just helped them and made sure things got done.

At my current place, I spent the first half a year becoming acquainted with the product and customers. Currently, I have just begun a 6 months project to launch our product into a new industry. I will have my own team and handle all the market and UX decisions for this new version of our product. It'll be an incredible experience.

&gt; Why did you leave the larger co?

IMO, the best place to learn PM is with experienced PMs who can help you learn the processes and rules to being a PM. Everyone says PM is like being a mini CEO and this is the best place to learn while not have too much freedom (which can cause problems). Once you have the fundamentals, I think finding a startup where the CEO wants to step back from being a PM and taking over their roles gives you great responsibility and great financial reward. This is where I am at now.
&gt; Biggest mistake as a PM?

Generally you don't get to be a PM by making big mistakes, you get it by being awesome and contributing to the team and being a rock-star when it comes to sound customer based decisions. Having said that, places where I feel big mistakes can come from are two parts:

1. Not focusing on the customer enough (or the converse, trying to make custom solutions for every customer)
2. Not defending your team from outsiders

The first one is first and foremost in every product decision. How can we solve the customers problem? Have to be careful here not to think every customer problem is unique, and to look at existing solutions first.
The second is a fine balancing act. You need to stick up for your team and yourself, especially when it comes to a new company. At the same time, you need to be the conduit between your team and development and everyone else. You take the blame, but you make sure your team doesn't make the same mistake again.

&gt; Did you do consulting before or after PM?

Because it's the most cost effective thing to do at the current moment. Say it takes 6 months for them to get another person at your productivity level.

Look at it this way. If you are the manager of some good employee who 6 months in gives his two weeks ( without him coming to you to talk about future, or promotion, or what other companies were offering) and all of the sudden you're out an employee and it's not even twoish years yet. Two weeks is shows that someone has already made a decision, now you're flip flopping. To me, you're a serious flight risk and not trust worthy to come talk to me about what happened one on one, there are just too many red flags here.

Immigration for one: It is bridges foreign, domestic, and natsec. I trust that he's strong enough to find a solution, and it doesn't have to be the ""ideal"" solution but any solution which isn't just kicking the puck down the road. But we know from his policies that it is american's first, then immigrants. Promoting the 'home of the free' without the 'just let everyone in all the time'. 

Second would be China. As someone with a lot of experience with China (both work and family), you have to be tough to play with China. And we know Trump is tough. Again, it isn't about getting the best conservative solution, but being strong both economically and militarily with China. You have to earn respect with them. They don't want a war but they idolize america in many ways. Us being weak with them kills that.

I didn't care what position to was for as long as it wasn't back office work or sales, I wanted to be in the core of the company so I interviewed for Texas companies while in China.

Once inside I learned what kind of paths there were in software companies and knew that project manager or product manager paths would be best.

I picked the lowest job in a tech company that was growing fast (customer support) and worked up from there. Now 2 years later, we have another child, i've more than tripled my income, great prospects and unlimited potential here. 

So in short, bite the bullet, pick the industry and type of job you want and go for it. Sure, knowing Chinese is great but your opportunities are EXTREMELY limited there and you will need great connections for it. Just come back, be an american, and use Chinese as a wow factor but it won't get you the job.

2571,"OK, so I just tried this build. Was great early on but I don't feel it scales well. First of all, where do you get the aghs. Since you got ATOS, you have to get another mana item at least like euls to then afford the mana for aghs. Problem is you also need BKB usually by that time. So by the time you start building aghs it's a 5th slot item, which you probably would have wanted hex by then. 

by getting atos you're focusing on your solo target damage when really you should be focusing on group damage. Thus, bloodstone to aghs to utility items is probably better in most cases. Sure I can take down that one target quickly with atos, but if i have the two chakrams, I only need half as much time to deal damage.

Plus I think you forget to mention that the key source of chakram damage is actually the initial and exiting hit of the chakram. by not getting aghs early, you're losing out on 50% damage",2015-06-27 13:09:58+00:00,cskg4ux,1.0,t3_3b91qd,49218.0,TrueDoTA2
