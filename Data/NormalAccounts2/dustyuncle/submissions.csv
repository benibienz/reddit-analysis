The biggest reason for the move for all parties are the tax savings advantages.

For the Cayman employees they will just directly pay through Cayman's CEC. What about me? My boss said if we can't figure it out we'll just 1099 and he will ask Deloitte if there are other possibilities, but I want to find out if there is another way more quickly so I don't have to wait around for deloitte (company comes first, with employees second)

So, should the company just send me my paycheck directly and I deal with it (like a 1099), or is there still a way to stay an employee even though they don't have an office in China. Now that I'm writing this, I see 1099 as the only way but hopefully you guys know some possibilities (maybe employ me in Cayman and pay me there, but there are fees for that)?

Hi All,

Selling my Gaming PC before I leave the country. It has the below parts. Building that PC today would cost 750, so I am selling it for 550. It's been used for 1.5 years and has been great for HD gaming. Comes with an i5, 23 inch dell IPS monitor, and a great case. 500 GB hard drive included

I'm in Dallas Texas.

**Have you read the sidebar and [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules)? (Please do)**

Yes

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

This is primarily a 4K gaming rig to get me through gaming for the next year before I make another trip back to the US. I play games like Witcher 3, Fallout 4, GTAV, Star Citizen and others. 

As you have noticed, I've put EVGA parts in here because of their support policy. They are the only manufacturer that will support me in China directly without me having to send it back to the US, so I would like to use their stuff where possible.

I currently have a 4k rig with a 980ti but will be selling it and buying top parts before I go. One requirement is that I need to buy the expensive parts before I go to China (this is why I have bought i7 5829k already and will buy the EVGA 980ti before I go). All other parts need to be popular/available on Newegg so I can buy them directly in China. 

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for?**

4K FPS

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

After Video Card, and i7 and PSU ~ 1000

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

China USA

**Post a draft of your potential build here (specific parts please). **
