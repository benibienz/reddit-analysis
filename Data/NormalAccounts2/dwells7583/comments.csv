14,"This morning at 9:45 a.m. Environmental Conservation Officer (ECO) Jeff Hull received a call reporting that a deer in Centereach NY (Suffolk County), had managed to get its head stuck inside a light globe and had been laying in the woods since the previous night. Upon arrival, ECO Hull spotted the deer about 20 yards from the road in a housing development. ECO Hull approached the deer, but on his first attempt, the wet globe slipped out of his hands and the deer ran into a nearby downed tree, causing it to fall.

On his second attempt, ECO Hull flung his coat over the globe, bear hugging it with both arms as the deer kicked and struggled to break free. The deer managed to slip out of the globe and ran off into the woods. ECO Hull was left with a good story and a few bruises but his integrity intact.",2016-05-04 00:31:24+00:00,d2rs2hp,1.0,t3_4hrwgh,10.0,pics

117,"There are a number of ways that whales can meet the end of their lives. So called natural deaths, due to old age, for example, are thought to occur but little is known about such events. Human activity-related causes of death like entanglement, ship strike, pollution, all pose very serious threats to cetaceans and combined cause hundreds of thousands of deaths per year.

There are also a number of infectious diseases that can have fatal effects on whales, as can bacterial, viral, and fungal infections. Non-infectious diseases such as arthritis have also been observed in whales and may eventually lead to death. In many cases, diseases can cause animals to become slow and weak, making them susceptible to predators or unable to properly feed before succumbing to disease.",2015-06-19 13:53:50+00:00,csbu6kk,2.0,t1_csbu1ny,277.0,videos
