7,"Of course we will continue embracing and fighting for those ideals because we firmly believe that equality and social justice are the right ideals to stand for.


Again, it's not that our ideals failed. It's that the leaders associated with those ideals failed to address the most pressing concerns such as the economy. We branded ourselves ""the left"" when our politicians continued to take favors from the elite and let the gap between the rich and the poor continue to grow. Our rhetoric was weak not because we had poor speech writers--it was because the politicians who delivered them came across as insincere and incompetent.


This is the only reason why the right wing seems so successful right now. Later on, when people experience their own brand of incompetence, it's gonna be their turn to taste a backlash. And my only hope is that by then, liberals would rally behind someone who truly stands for liberal ideals and who is brave and competent enough to deliver the goods.

8,"&gt; Don't get me wrong, right wing extremists do that too with the addition of hate+fire+brimstone. 


So why do people buy their ideas? Because they're soft and nice? No, it's because the atmosphere is ripe for their propaganda. 


Just take a look at Michael Moore. The guy ran an amazing campaign that's based on sympathy for Trump and Bernie supporters, convincing them that if they're just voting for Trump becuase they hate the corrupt establishment, they need to reconsider because Hillary can actually do so much better for their pockets. 


But what did those right-wing people do? They spliced his videos making it look like Moore's actually a Trump supporter. And of course we all know how his campaign made a lot of difference come election day.


At the end of the day, values and beliefs don't change overnight. For the most part, liberals are failing right now because people feel victimized by outgoing liberal leaders who failed to deliver the change they promised. We antagonized them even before we wrote those sarcastic essays. We alienated them when we prioritized and celebrated our first world concerns such as same sex marriage, when they still can't get a decent job. Not that I'm criticizing LGBT rights--I believe that's a step towards the right direction--but a conservative, jobless American wouldn't feel the same way about that.",2016-11-11 22:58:22+00:00,d9whifo,3.0,t1_d9vscne,34400.0,Philippines

Mas challenging na ang schoolwork at mas maaga silang naeexpose sa maraming distractions. Not to mention, kahit 50% ng genes nila galing sayo, ibang tao pa rin sila, at malaki pa rin ang chance na iba ang magiging response nila to the same type of upbringing. Kung ikaw okay lang na pinapalo noon yung mga anak mo hindi mo masasabi kung mag-develop sila ng anxiety or low self esteem paglaki nila.

So kahapon mga lunch time, kumakain kami, pumasok sya sa condo. Niyaya namin kumain pero naglunch na daw sya. Para may pagkaabalahan, binuksan ni SO yung PS4.


Nahirapan ata sa single player game so hindi nya tinantanan si SO. Maglaro na daw sila. It came to a point na ang mga sinasabi na nya ""Kuya ang bagal mo naman kumain!"" Tsaka ""Last na subo na yan ha maglalaro na tayo pagkatapos!"" Sabi sa kanya ni SO saglit lang pero hindi sya madaan sa pakiusap, gusto nung bata sya ang masunod.


Uminit ang ulo ko. Entitled amputa. May sinat pa si SO tas hindi makakain ng maayos. Feeling ko pa parang kaedaran lang tingin nya kay SO kaya wala syang galang so talagang nainis na ako. Nasigawan ko sya.

120,"&gt;the bible explicitly tells you work hard for God then you shall be blessed.

The Bible says many things, interpreted by people in many ways. You can't say that your interpretation of the Bible is the only one that's accurate unless you wrote it yourself. 


I know that because I was a Christian and during Bible study sessions/prayer meetings, we were encouraged to take Bible verses that helped us go through whatever we were struggling with for the past week. Those verses frequently came up, with those very interpretations. They are blessed because they are poor...Money can't buy salvation and happiness...They know that God weeps with them as they suffer...Their reward is in heaven. I know people my age who chose to volunteer full-time in church than pursue a paying career because Matt. 6:19-21.


At the end of the day, we choose the gods we worship--consciously or not. If you're rich, lucky, and opportunities come your way, it's easy to believe that God rewards your faithfulness and hardwork with material things. However, if life seems to be nothing but a series of struggles for you, it's not that hard to imagine that this lifetime is only a test, an you will be rewarded in the next.

The Christian faith is very poor-friendly. Those Bible verses were all direct quotes from Jesus, and it looks like he has a soft spot for those in need. So if you're poor but you believe that Jesus is God, all you need to do is read your Bible or pray and you'd feel better about yourself. Yes there may be social injustice around, but you believe that God is always just, and he'll reward us accordingly in eternity. Participating in a revolution to overthrow the rich--one that may be violent and could be against God's laws--just shows an utter lack of faith.

Those who are pure Chinese are especially stricter about preserving this part of their culture. 


I know this because I had 4 batchmates (2 pairs of pureChi x Fil) who had Mano Po love stories in college and now have broken up because the Chinese side doesn't approve.

I don't think my response to your previous comment solicits that kind of reaction. Read again, because in essence, I was agreeing with what you were saying, and I was just adding upon it. Kaya nga hindi ako nag-comment separately, because someone already said what I was about to say about carbs, etc. I just added a reference about satiety, and then gave OP advice about how he should eat. 


I'm sorry if you were offended by what I said, but you should have read that in the context of my entire post. Yung sakin lang naman, people tend to be more open to the ideas we share if we do so in a friendly tone. Lalo na kasi in the first place hindi naman yun yung subject ng post ni OP eh, nag-call out lang tayo kasi nasho-shock tayo sa carb intake nya.

[And to add, scientifically speaking, hindi carbs ang ""nakakabusog"" (i.e. promotes satiety), it's mainly protein and fiber (coz it holds water).](http://nutritiondata.self.com/topics/fullness-factor) See ""General Observations"" Section.


And I'll give unsolicited advice to OP: Don't wait for the ""busog"" feeling for you to stop eating. Our brains are maladapted to allow (encourage, even) us to overeat, thanks to our ancestors who had scarce food. While it's okay to binge sometimes, you should have an estimate of the portion size that's right for you based on RDA.

Hey, this is not a case of people clicking on spam. I personally thought it was a hoax at first too, but I called them, and they verified whatever info was announced. Also went to BPI earlier today and they were just giving out forms to whoever went there and asked for it. This is obviously a crazy case of BPI's indecision/miscommunication, and since a good chunk of our life savings is there, we have no choice but to comply with whatever they say. I don't know how it became another case of stupid millennials' fear mongering and overreacting to you.

265,"Hi Sir, I appreciate you sharing this--it's a bit comforting to know that I didn't miss much today--but I believe Marvel is really strict with confidentiality, and they have ways to track people who post spoilers online. (I think I've seen posts here about Marvel tracking extras/audiences down because they posted spoilers.) You signed an NDA with them and if I were in your place that's something I wouldn't  mess with, no matter how disappointed I am.


And even if they don't find exactly who you are from the 1,000 attendees today, I think you posting this will give Manila a bad reputation. Who knows if they stop showing exclusive stuff to the Philippines because they think Filipinos can't comply with their standards for confidentiality? Of course they don't stop showing stuff to SDCC even if people leak stuff there, because that's SDCC; but APCC is a pretty small convention (Heck, they don't even have a DCEU showcase to compete with here), and the Phils is a relatively small market--I don't think it will hurt their pockets if they don't showcase their exclusives here.

Didn't make it to Hall M this year (still had a blast at the convention though), so I only hope there will be a Marvel Showcase next year to look forward to.

Not safe, nor altruistic, but it can be viewed as practical. Filipino politicians ""give back"" generously to their hometowns and appoint people who come from the same province/region as they did.

Let me share what I heard from my dad and titos who are avid sports fans (basketball and boxing, at least). This is just their opinion but I think there's more insight to it too.

Back when the Azkals were having a streak, we watched their games on TV and one of my titos made a comment that football, unlike basketball, is ""nakakapagod panoorin"" (tiresome to watch). His brothers agreed. It takes a while before teams get to score, and the delicate footwork involved in ball handling looks less natural than the manly manner of dribbling and driving in basketball.

293,"Aside from the usual explanation that people are fed up or angry and see Duterte as the savior that would lift them from desperation--that explanation is very true, but I believe there's another aspect to it--there's also some sort of regionalistic pride at play in this situation. 


Duterte is the first president who is an outsider with respect to ""Imperial Manila"". He is a mayor from Mindanao, who speaks a widely-spoken Visayan language, even on speeches televised nationwide. *People who once saw the presidency as something so distant and irrelevant to their lives finally saw someone in that role who is relatable and appealing.* And I'm not just talking about people who actually live in the Visayas and Mindanao area, there are also people who live in Manila but still identify themselves as Cebuano or Davaoeño.


These people tend to think that Duterte represents the attitudes, values and aspirations of their region, so that results to a personal bias that's difficult to overcome. Think about it: If you had a favorite actor or athlete, and you've made this person your personal hero, it's pretty much the same thing. When rumor goes out that he's unprofessional, a druggie, or a wife-beater, you'd say anything to defend him because he's your hero--and you want to preserve that idealized version of him in your mind.



Of course I'm not saying that the only Duterte defenders are those from his region; neither am I saying that there are zero Visayans and Mindanaoans who criticize Duterte. I'm just explaining something I've observed so far--that most vocal supporters of Duterte in my social circle come from those regions--and their support for him sounds less of the support a politician should get (i.e., issue/policy-based), but more of that fit for an idealized hero (i.e., personality-based, ""he's a great strategist/visionary/leader"", ""we should trust in him"").",2016-08-26 02:49:48+00:00,d6x0m9k,1.0,t3_4zk5y4,28588.0,Philippines

If the police in your area are really serious about the campaign, he should have been on their watch list long before. If they're not, and you decide to take the extra mile of reporting them, you risk yourself and your whole family. Seems to be not worth the risk.


I also know someone in my family's community (I already moved out since last year) who is a drug pusher. Our home was robbed once and he was the primary suspect. The pusher also has this brother who seems to have lost his mind and would greet me in a creepy way every time he sees me on the street. He also throws rocks on the roof of some houses (including ours) on his bad days. The best we can do is just safeguard our house and ignore them. We try to act normal when they approach us, but we refuse any invitation (come up with excuses like someone is sick or we're going somewhere). 


Even with this all-out war on drugs, my family never considered getting into the mess of reporting them to the police, because it's an open secret that everyone in the community (including the police) already knows about their illegal activities.

365,"True story:

When I was still single, I gave 20k per month to my parents. I had a well-paying job but I lived in a crappy dorm (because malayo ang workplace sa bahay) and would find myself short a few days into payday. Of course, wala din akong ipon. My parents never supported my grandparents, sila pa nanghihingi noon kina Lolo and Lola, but they always assumed that it's easy to give away hard-earned money. Never kong narinig na ""anak ipunin mo muna yan"" or ""bili ka muna ng gusto mo"" kahit 1 payday or pamasko man lang sana. Yung bonus sana na iniipon ko, maalala ng tatay ko pag may bayarin yung kapatid ko sa school. ""Nakatanggap ka ng bonus last month di ba? Bigay mo muna sa mama mo."" And even with the money I give, puro pa din reklamo at parinig na ang daming utang or ang daming bayarin sa school. Sabi ko sa kanila noon bakit hindi sila mag-budget--ilista yung kinikita v. expenses--but they were offended. Bakit mas marunong pa daw ako.


A little more than two years into this, I fell into depression. After a few suicide attempts, I decided to move out of the toxic environment at home and live with my boyfriend. Life is so much better now. They hate me to their guts, and things won't be the same no matter how much effort I make to reach out. I treat them to dinner and movies sometimes and send a little money, pero hindi na enough. Even the siblings I once spoiled hate me now, nasulsulan na siguro. 


Hindi totoong hindi matitiis ng magulang ang anak. Depende rin sa expectations ng magulang yan.


I'm now 2 months pregnant, happy and hoping for the best. My fiance and I swear to work hard for our child, and we do our best to manage our finances. We'll break the cycle in our generation.


So I guess wag magpaka-martyr OP? Magbigay pero lagyan ng limit, kasi kahit gaano kalaki ibigay mo, if they don't manage finances well, it won't be enough. Siguro tama rin yung advice ng coworkers ko noon na dapat hindi nila alam how much you earn, kasi magkakaron ng expectation na ganito sobra sa kinikita mo, dapat ganito ang matitira sa amin.

LKY managed to change Singapore for the better by coupling his strongman leadership with the preexisting Confucian-Legalist principles that are heavily embedded in their culture.

Culture? Foreign relations? *Hindi tayo matatapos sa usapan kasi wala namang universal criteria/algorithm for identifying a good president.*

So I guess it's better to evaluate Digong based on how he performs on each aspect of his job. If he manages to solve our problems with economy, infrastructure, peace and order--then that's great. Give him a round of applause. Write books about him, and how he did it. Tell those stories to your children and grandchildren.

But, if he would simultaneously suppress our FoS, promote barbaric principles, and strain our foreign relations, those will also have serious implications and he has to be called out for that. We are not supposed to make excuses for those failures just because we benefit from some of his great achievements. Nothing personal, but he wanted that job--and it's a damn tough job.

Will he be ""good"" or ""bad"" in my book? It doesn't matter at all. I don't even think I have to decide on that. Will he be able to solve corruption, crime, poverty, political dynasties, extra-judicial killings, China dispute, etc.? Those are the questions that matter.

518,"Duterte is in no way like Binay, Estrada and Marcos, and as his supporter, you should already know that. Those people you keep mentioning are already known to be corrupt, so Duterte's issues would definitely pale in comparison to theirs. And that's also why Binay is not winning the elections. 

However, Duterte presents himself as the change candidate, and most people buy it and rally behind him. But I believe that a radical/transformational candidate who also happens to be corrupt is a hypocrite, which is even worse that a trapo--because he can fool people into believing that he is the real thing when he is not. This is why it's important to get to the bottom of this issue, if possible, before election day.

And coming from a 'naive' person like me, let me tell you that it's time you start taking a lawyer's statement with a grain of salt. He's being paid to defend his client, not to tell the truth, you know.

527,"Let me start by saying that our country has a weak political party system. The platforms of our candidates tend to belong to the same anti-poverty, anti-crime, pro-health, pro-education, pro-jobs and pro-infrastructure rhetoric--probably only varying in terms of emphasis and implementation plans. 

Having candidates that belong to a certain party with strong ideals and principles can be really helpful. This makes them quite predictable. For example, albeit controversial, Trump can be expected to make decisions that favor Republican ideals and principles, such as protecting investors, lowering taxes, supporting the military and preserving borders. That's one advantage that most countries have (and I assume your country has, too). 

But we have a political system based on personalities. Flipping sides among our politicians is very common, especially when power shifts from one side to another. This is how things get done in our country. Basically, if you get a corrupt person on top who is willing to offer bribes (which could be in the form of money or autonomy) just to get his way, he will get his way.

Duterte and his children did 20 years of service to a city in the southern part of the Philippines, Davao City. To their credit, Davao did become more peaceful and highly livable during his term. But there are allegations made by Human Rights groups linking him to the death quads that were said to do mass executions of suspected drug users and pushers. These allegations are not proven but he hasn't condemned the vigilantes either. He has made public statements that are sympathetic to communist groups. He has also not disclosed the identities of the donors that made his ubiquitous TV and Internet campaign ads possible. 

Recently, a Senator (who also runs for Vice-Pres) made allegations that he has undisclosed wealth (allegedly reaching about 200 billion pesos in total transactions) from his mandatory Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Instead of being the usually brave and straightforward guy that he is known to be, his camp now seems to be a bit more careful about this issue. For example, any bank account holder could easily request a bank for a detailed transaction history, and it would be easily prove that he has nothing to hide. Instead of doing so, his lawyer requested for the current balance (P17,000) and a statement from the bank as to whether the past transactions really reach up to the 200B. Predictably, bank said such statement would take time, and they can only release it past election day.

TL;DR: The guy is questionable, and we all tend to fear the unknown. And I mean not just 'crazy' and 'irrational' people like me, but foreign investors, allies and tourists as well.",2016-05-03 10:47:40+00:00,d2qurhk,1.0,t3_4hllih,23762.0,Philippines

At that time I may have caught Captain America's series on TV, which opened with a really cheesy theme, and I just thought that maybe that cartoon was as old as my grandparents.

But in terms of scale, choreography and synergy among characters in an ensemble, the 17-minute airport scene in Civil War will go down in history as the one ""fight scene to beat"" among superhero movies from now on.

582,"If you listen carefully to Duterte and Sanders, you'll know that there is a wide difference. 

Sanders does not remotely leverage on crime and war to inspire a violent revolution--instead, he looks at other democratic and progressive countries and asks questions like, ""if they can afford socialized healthcare, why can't we?"" Being an experienced legislator and staunch intellectual, his goal is to equalize wealth in America by raising taxes on large corporations and giving the returns to the poorest of the poor.

Duterte, on the other hand, has [professed sympathy for the NPA](http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/728472/duterte-to-npa-lets-prepare-for-a-peaceful-life-during-my-presidency) and disgust for the ruling elite. He emphasizes the urgency of the war on crime and drugs as if 'creating revolutionary waters so that the fish can swim' ala-Mao Zedong. He cites his 20-year rule in Davao as his template for a 3-6 month campaign, which of course any intelligent person would find dubious. He also calls for the necessity of violence to make necessary changes in our country, which we all know is a classic communist move. 

Duterte is either a closet communist or just a confused politician like Trump, but he is nowhere near a democratic socialist like Sanders.

With Miriam's health getting worse and Poe being drawn to the Danding issue, I wanna give Duterte a chance. But honestly, with the history of extra judicial killings and all, I want to be assured that if I surrender my freedom, I'll get something worthwhile in return. 


So can we really expect him to deliver the goods? Doesn't he have the tendency to become like Marcos, where if you spot and say anything against the government, you're dead, so naturally everyone in the news will just praise him? And is he really immune to corruption and private interest? How did you know that for sure?


Duterte supporters, I wanna hear you out. What exactly did he did he do to Davao that he can realistically do for the benefit of the whole country??",2016-03-22 03:36:38+00:00,d18qw4p,1.0,t3_4bff14,7030.0,Philippines

673,"Please don't apologize for ""hitting a nerve"". Don't assume that everyone argues out of emotion and not logic. This is an intellectual discussion where we try to weigh the merits of arguments against SSM. I believe that discussions about public policy should go beyond our personal biases. Law, above all else, must protect the right and dignity of each citizen, regardless of personal belief. 

This is not a personal issue to me. I am not a member of the LGBT community. I am a heterosexual female who is currently engaged in a happy relationship with a heterosexual male. I do not even remotely understand how it feels like to be lesbian, but I do not fear what I don't understand. In this issue, I fully support the LGBT community, because I think that they are being unfairly deprived of civil rights and are being discriminated just because people are highly prejudiced, thanks to their conservative personal beliefs.

I appreciate your courtesy, but no, you didn't hit a nerve. I can just be sarcastic and condescending sometimes.

I would like to state my argument again, which with all your nitpicking and sentence by sentence response, you still haven't addressed. Your argument is that you are against SSM because it goes against tradition. My argument is that SSM will not affect tradition, because it will not force any practicing Catholic/Christian/any other anti-SSM religion to do anything that will violate their beliefs.

And also, FYI, the use of the word ""reputedly"" in history, does not mean that there is no evidence to support it, as if it came out of my imagination or it's just another age-old myth. It just so happens that it's quite difficult for historians to establish findings from the pre-colonial era because very little evidence survives today. While there are evidence to support that there have been transsexual priests, it's just really tough to gather enough evidence on this matter, so the academe is still pretty divided to different schools of thought. For more on the Babaylan, [here you go](https://www.facebook.com/Letse2015Ka/photos/a.976117439146037.1073741841.770948089662974/976117489146032/?type=3&amp;theater).

You stated that we've always had the tradition of marrying male to female, when in fact, this is just your highly prejudiced assumption. It could have been male to many females, female to many males, male to male or female to female. You have no evidence that homosexuality did not exist before the pre-colonial era, and heterosexual monogamy is the only marriage tradition that we should always uphold.",2016-02-20 01:00:51+00:00,d06k8vu,8.0,t1_d05rawc,46133.0,Philippines

And actually, on your point that standard heterosexual marriages have always been part of tradition, I'd like to let you know that homosexual marriages have also been part of our pre-Hispanic tradition. Before the Spaniards came, we have a long history of honoring a Babaylan, a male or female who assumed the role of a priestess/leader, and who was allowed to take male consorts for husbands.

Legitimizing SSM will not force all of us to marry a person of the same sex, so if your tradition says that man is to woman then you can go on and keep that. If a person from your denomination would like to marry a person of the same sex but your tradition does not allow that, then your pastor/priest doesn't have to marry them. What this law will do is allow LGBTs to marry the person they choose in civil unions, and I don't think that should have any impact on your Christian/Catholic tradition.",2016-02-19 08:14:07+00:00,d05njul,4.0,t1_d05mm06,3069.0,Philippines

696,"&gt;this is not only in PH pati sa ibang bansa pag usapang same sex marriage nagagalit sila sa simbahan pero bakit di sila magalit sa muslim or orthodox or other religions na hindi pwede ang same sex marriage? bakit sa christianity lang?

I think it's an outrageous thing to wonder if LGBT rights groups are attacking Christianity for hatred's sake. Let's remember that they are the marginalized side in this case. The church holds the power to influence votes and excommunicate public figures, while gays are striving to attain equal rights in a way that clashes with religious doctrine. 

Imagine if bishops, priests and pastors just let lawmakers do their jobs by weighing the merits of same-sex marriage using secular viewpoint, without threatening to withdraw their church members' votes if they support same-sex marriage, would there be such as massive issue? If Imams and Buddhist monks also made trending remarks against gays, I'm pretty sure that they'd also go under fire for that. (Of course that's unless you're in country that doesn't give its people the right to free speech.)

697,"The thing is, ""natural law"" can be a fuzzy thing for logic. In this context, I don't think that it's defined in a way that encompasses religion and personal belief. 

If you say that ""natural"" is what exists in nature, we have gone a long way in defining what that means. Our ancestors had very little idea of how nature works, so they had mythology, religion and tradition to draw the line between what's natural and what's not. Now, we have science to prove that nature does not really comply with our preconceived notions of what is natural. For example, most animals practice polygamy, polyandry, serial monogamy, and some even engage in homosexual behavior and inter-species sex. 

Some would also say that ""natural"" is what nature or God intended us to be, based on observations of our biological structure, and are usually illustrated in a way that conveniently complies with social norms. But that assumes that there exists a universally-accepted, self-aware, supreme being that intends certain things to be. And apparently, most people agree to disagree that there is such.

In a nutshell, I dare say that anyone who judges the morality of a custom/behavior/law based on its being ""natural"", while we live in a time when we haven't completely uncovered all the mysteries of nature and the nature of nature itself, is in grave danger of prejudice.",2016-02-17 07:15:51+00:00,d02yrw5,2.0,t1_d01yo6m,56198.0,Philippines
