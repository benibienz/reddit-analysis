My SO pointed out that those who want to criticize the government and widen their influence should take it easy in pumping out think pieces, kasi hindi naman naa-appreciate ng masa--sila-sila lang rin na mga intelektwal ang nakaka-appreciate at naga-agree. 


Don't get me wrong, I like reading those essays. Their arguments are helpful in solidifying our stance on certain issues, and they should continue to flourish up to a certain extent. Pero oo nga naman, it can be alienating to those who can't appreciate arguments and lengthy essays (and not to be condescending or anything, but the reality is the greater part of our population are people like that). Kung meme-level lang ang kaya i-process ng tao, aanhin nya yung flawless na analysis mo. At kung hindi naman magre-reach out ang mga mas educated sa masa, mas lalaki lang ang divide at lagi lang tayong magdi-disagree sa isa't-isa.


So dapat, meme sa meme na ang labanan ngayon. Kung may mga Facebook page na nagpapakalat ng propaganda at misinformation, baka Facebook page din ang sagot para magising ang mga tao at maging mas kritikal na ang pag-iisip. With the same type of humor and simplicity used to spread facts instead of lies, a page like that could go far.


Example: a meme about some twisted lie on Marcos' greatness and heroism that sounds like a fact, tapos disclaimer in tiny font: ""At naniwala ka naman. Hindi lahat ng nasa Facebook ay totoo. Google-Google din pag may time.""


Posted this because I hope someone witty and good with that social media/graphic design thingy picks this up. Thanks.

You know, for the sake of informed decision-making as any wise voter should.

I've thought of a few arguments against her and provided my counter-arguments below:

a. Talong-talo sya sa survey: Ano ang eleksyon, sabong? Sayang ang pusta ko pag talo ang manok ko? Pag natalo si Miriam, sayang *siya*, pero hindi sayang ang boto ko sa kanya kasi alam kong deserving sya.

b. May sakit sya: ~~Eh kasi naman bakit hindi nyo binoto during her prime, nagpadala kayo sa mga chismis at pinili nyo pa si Erap instead.~~ She's a fighter and she's got the best treatment out there. Mukha ding hindi naman sya yung tipong madaling tumiklop sa sakit--lalo na dahil passion nya talaga ang leadership and public service. Kaya nga pinili nya tumakbo kaysa magpahinga di ba? 

c. Naki-tandem sya kay Bongbong: Eh di wag nyo iboto si BBM kung ayaw nyo sa running mate nya, as if naman nagsi-stick kayo sa mga tandem sa ibang partido. May separate VP debate din naman so that should help you choose kung sino ang best VP for her.

I always hear that ""no candidate is perfect"". I agree, but I think we drop that card too often. It's about time we apply that argument to the one candidate who unquestionably has both competence AND character.

Yes, she is not perfect--but hey, she *almost* is.

From the spirited and promising person that people knew me to be, I became lethargic, alcoholic and suicidal. I thought about taking my own life everyday, and I did attempt suicide thrice in different ways during that episode, the darkest of which lasted for about four months. 

I consulted a psychiatrist and took antidepressants for some time, but I found the whole treatment to be depressingly expensive, so once I felt emotionally stable (thanks to talk therapy and meds), I made a couple of changes in my life to help me cope easier. Now that I have a more supportive environment and a way to channel my emotions with my work, I've become a much happier person. May mood swings pa rin, and the tendency to overthink doesn't really go away (it could be my greatest strength too), but now that I am more aware of my tendencies, I can help myself better when a trigger comes.

My SO, family and the few friends left really love me and I appreciate them for that, but I think that they can only do so much. I couldn't blame them if I have behaviors and thought patterns that they won't understand. I also doesn't help that unlike other illnesses, I can't tell everyone about what I'm suffering from, because we all know how mental illnesses are stigmatized in our society. I also wonder how people with mood disorders, who happen to not afford even a single session with a psychiatrist, or don't have even a single friend who would care to listen to them, are coping. 

So, ayun lang. I'm hoping to find or start a free, organized group therapy for people with mood disorders. If meron na, I would like to join and help spread the word. Kung wala pa, let me know if you're interested and we'll start one. 

Thanks!
