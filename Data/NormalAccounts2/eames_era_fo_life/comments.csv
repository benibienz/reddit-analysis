147,Yeah personally as a guy I would never admit to a dry spell and here's why. I'm a firm believer the friend zone is create by a lack of urgency. If a woman knows you have been laid in a year  she knows that she can keep you around as that guys friend who is extra nice to her because he wants to get laid.  And if she want she can sleep with you any time she wants. But if she perceives you as a catch who has options then she feels that if she doesn't sleep with you someone else will. This is purely an observation in my personal life.,2016-06-28 20:30:59+00:00,d4ro9sl,3.0,t1_d4rjdgg,6399.0,AskReddit
148,It's because they have so many options. And so do the very attractive guys. Which creates what I like to call the tinder paradox. I'm going to use the 1-10 rating system I know it is shallow and objectifies people but tinder is shallow. Ok so basicly most women in the 5-7 range have quite a few matches with a variety of guys. A few of them are 10's who are likely out of there league and swiped right because of miss leading photos. These women then develop very high standards. But these guys are never going to message them because they have tons of matches because they are 10s. So guys who are 5-7 now look like butt ugly mutants and are ignored by the 5-7 women who they would be great with. ,2016-06-28 20:16:55+00:00,d4rnmj5,2.0,t1_d4racpd,17369.0,AskReddit

167,"I'm not going to analyze you relationship with your BF like the rest of the comments seem to be. I just going to give dirty talk advice from a XY perspective. For many guys porn is a regular part of their masturbation routine. Because of this we are often turned on by vocal women. I understand this is not the norm for most women. So at some level we are hoping for women to fake it or at least embellish it. If I were you I would take this opportunity to teach your BF about exactly what gets you off with vocal cues and instructions contrary to popular belief men don't mind being told what to do in bed. 
Now I understand you feel awkward about some elements of dirty talk that is normal and not a big deal. Just take your time don't over think it and throw your inhibitions to the wind your in a safe place and if you say something silly it's not the end of the world. Here are a few phrases to try out that I'm pretty sure every guy like to here. ""Fuck that feels good"" ""don't fucking stop"" ""omg you feel so big"" ""omg you're so deep""  ""do you like that?"" ""How do you wanna fuck me next?"" Or any combination of theses thing should be a turn on for him.

If I went to Pakistan I wouldn't expect them to start serving back bacon and beaver tales at the university cafe and I wouldn't expect people to be cool with me wearing my leafs jersey to a wedding. I know these are silly examples but there is a Canadian way of life that I have no expectation for other countries to accommodate when I travel. So it annoys me when new Canadians use our lack of a distinct culture and a free pass to complain about us not being accepting/accommodating enough. 

Examples include:
There's not enough halal/kosher options.
Why are all the signs in English? 
I should get holidays for my religious holiday. 
I'm offended that they say merry Christmas.

If I was in another country and they said a traditional holiday greeting. It would seem crazy that I was upset. I would not expect to get a day off for Canada day or Easter.

As a Canadian if I go to another country I would not expect them to change anything about their culture for me.  I know Canada is a country of immigrants but we still have a culture.

475,I also hate clubs but when I go I try to make the best of it especially post break up. Yes lots of girls are a tease at clubs but many of them go to clubs to get laid just like you. You shouldn't look for something serious at a club so go ahead and lower your standards after all your on a rebound. Remember to pre drink so you don't have to drink at that club. Bring a wing man or better yet wing woman or even better wing gay guy. As far as hitting on girls goes I'm a fan of finding one terrifying creepy dude lurking in the club trying to eye fuck every girl in the place or a crazy dancer. I point him out to the girl I'm interested in. This does 2 things makes her laugh and shows her you have the social skills to understand that guy is doing it wrong. So Superman next time your at a club you should drink less never talk about your ex and chat up some girls who are not as attractive as your ex about how it must be hard for a cute girls like her to ward off creepers. ,2016-02-23 16:51:43+00:00,d0aqq23,2.0,t1_d0anawh,4896.0,AskReddit
