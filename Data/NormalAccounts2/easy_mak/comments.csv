No. This is a useless exercise. There's no way to know what your CTR will be until you run the ad. Two ads on the same keyword could have entirely different CTRs based on bid, placement, ad copy, call to action, brand recognition, etc.

If you want to project something, I'd lean towards expected clicks based on a budget (budget / avg cpc via keyword planner): You have a budget of $1,000, Keyword Planner says this keyword is $5 CPC, so you can expect about 200 clicks.

Part of that was that I gave up my grandfathered plans to start a new contract due to stupid reasons like losing a phone and getting off my family plan when my mother's boyfriend tried to ""punish"" me by having her block my service when I was 20 years old. I just went and got a new plan in my name. :| Asshole. Anyway... lol.

165,"Haste &gt; Mastery are your top two stats. Enchant haste on neck/ring/back, spirit on weapon.

Demonic Phylactery and Unstable Felshadow Emulsion are your top two trinkets. Your class trinket is 3rd. UFE's leech won't show up on in-game meters (but there's skada addons that will capture it - no idea how accurate it actually is), but you'll be able to see the raid wide Leech on logs. Actually, depending on gear level of your raid, class trinket might be better than UFE to begin with? Maybe someone else can chime in on that... 

You want nearly 100% uptime on Harmony (increases your HoTs based on your Mastery), Lifebloom (on tanks - and you'll have 2 to use once you get your tier bonus), and your Wild Mushroom. I highly recommend WeakAura tracking for this.

Wild Growth is your most cost effective heal - given it doesn't over heal too much - so make sure you're timing it well.

Your almost guaranteed to have mana issues - resto druids are the most reliant healer class on mana. Stock up on Channeled Mana Pots and Regular Mana Pots. Learn the fights so you can find a free 8s to channel the mana pot to get the extra 15k-ish mana. You'll probably only want to resort to the regular mana pots if you're caught in a bind.

I personally prefer Nature's Vigil over Heart of the Wild, but if it's a 7min+ fight, HotW on pull + dps'ing then again near the end with some big heals / a tranq isn't too shabby, especially if you need a little extra dps to push first phase.

204,"First things first: TRACK EVERYTHING. Google Analytics on the website. I recommend CallRail for phone tracking. Make sure the top dogs are communicating how new business is coming in - small companies tend to hold information close to the chest, which I still don't get - but get what information you can, whether its just total parts sold / month or actual revenue / month.

If there's no PPC there, I'd start out with Bing Ads. Maybe like $500 / month, perhaps even less? B2B does decent there, and its cheaper than Adwords. Once you've learned your stuff and got stuff running smooth, copy/paste the campaign to Adwords. Adwords will probably cost 2-3x as much as Bing Ads, but will capture a much larger market. I would'nt worry about Social Media too much outside of keeping NAP consistency for SEO. LinkedIn is hit or miss. Check out ThomasNet. Maybe GlobalSpec360.

Optimize your website for basic SEO. Proper Titles, H1s, run it through the Google PageSpeed Tool, etc. Google some SEO analysis tools, run it through there. They'll all say some of the same things and have some differences.

Speaking of SEO, write blogs about the industry if you can. I know some manufacturing is boring as fuck, so blogs are basically just rehashing the same shit over and over.

Do you have a client list of e-mails? Could you have a newsletter? Check out MailChimp if you've got decent stuff to consistently share with your past/current customers. Do you have lots of potential repeat business? Use that e-mail list not only to send e-mails, but also to re-market (probably on GDN, not so much on Social, but could give it a shot).

A bit more salesy, but are leads being lost? Is there a CRM in place? A sales funnel? 

Then there's probably some traditional / print advertising they do? Like in some publications, magazines, who knows what. If you set up CallRail and want to continue with this stuff, set it up to use a new number so you can track those print leads. 

So yeah, that's a semi-drunk ramble. I basically did most of this at small engineering services company recently, so it's somewhat in the same vertical. Adwords, SEO, Bing Ads, ThomasNet were all the major difference makers - as long as they were executed properly.

Also... the people working there will know the ins and outs of the business and industry. But that doesn't mean they know how to market it. Use the data. Read the data. Love the data. Use it to make your case. For example, if the boss says they want to advertise in 10 states cuz those are the states that get all the business and don't want to miss out on a potential sale, ask for the breakdown. If its 90% in your state, stick to that one state, until you've dominated that market.

Google Grants gives non-profits $10,000 / month to spend. Hit up a non-profit that isn't actively utilizing it -- and if it's local, good luck spending anywhere near that limit. There's some limitations (max $2 CPC), no search partner networks, etc -- but it's a decent place to practice.

245,"Oh gosh, putting me on the spot. First, let me say - **I'm not an SEO expert** - but have a decent understanding of the basic stuff. Hopefully some one can chime in with a bit more in-depth answer (and maybe corrections?).

Before you make any changes, I'd use [Keyword Planner](https://adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner) to research variations of the topic the page is about. When it comes to semantics and synonyms, search engines sometimes know what is the same or different. Internet Marketing vs Digital Marketing (pretty sure Google counts this as the same term), Inspection vs Testing, Kitchen Remodeler vs. Kitchen Builder vs Kitchen Installer, Home Cleaning vs. Maid Cleaning, etc. 

Find which phrases work best for your biz/client - and keep track of them. Next, I would find out where you rank for the terms you want, with a tool like Moz or https://serps.com/tools/rank-checker/

And let me *very* clear... you **do not** want to be consistently rewriting static pages. SEO can take time and if you're constantly changing things, the ranking algorithm can never give your page credibility. But after an SEO audit, some sites might need their pages changed to reflect the current search queries users are using.

Remember those terms you researched? Use them in &lt;h1&gt; header tags on your website. Pretty much every page on your site should have an &lt;h1&gt; tag with specifically chosen text. You also want to make sure to use that phrase in your content.

These days, you simply can't ""keyword stuff"", but rather need quality content. Being informational, answer the ""question"" users are coming to your website for, etc. I try to answer questions like ""what is this?"" (define the service, set expectations, w/e), ""where is this?"" (are you a local biz? online?), ""how does it work?"", (features), ""how much does it cost"" (pricing), etc.

Title tags are the Page Title you see in your browser tab (in HTML: &lt;meta title=""content here""&gt;) -- is yours just ""Company XYZ"" for every page or is it ""Service #1 | Company XYZ"" for the Service #1 page, ""Service #2 | Company XYZ"" for the Service #2 page. Usually the first part of title and H1 are the same. If it's a local business, you probably want to include that in your title ""Service | Company XYZ | United States"" or ""Service in City, State | Company XYZ"", etc.

Are you using images on your page? Make sure the 'alt' tag in the &lt;img&gt; tag is used to define said image.

This all pretty basic level SEO stuff (keyword research, H1/Title Implementation, etc.). I'm sure things can get a more in-depth, but I'm not experienced in much beyond setting up the basics for the content writers to run away with.

Again, not an expert, but have some basic knowledge -- I don't think anything here is inaccurate, but take it with a grain of salt. Hope it helps! :)

If you want to focus on one thing, I'd personally avoid any business-related MS entirely. I'd be curious to see the courses for a Business Analytics masters and see how involved it really gets.

I'd just focus on actually doing that. Could start small with like ""Have you tested what time of day this account's audience responds the best?"" and keep upping the complexity of the questions until they can't answer -- then YOU find the answer.

Lastly, if none of that is feasible, you want to stay in marketing and be a specialist, I would either find a large enough agency that lets you do just one thing (SEO Specialist, PPC Specialist, E-Mail Marketing Specialist, etc.) or find a marketing job at a medium+ size corporation as a Marketing Analyst. Most small businesses have a team of like 0-2 marketing people -- who are jack of all trades and/or outsource most of the work.

On that same token, I'd try to build out a persona of who your customer is. IT managers at &lt;500 person companies? 5000+? Or are they software developers? With this information, you can definitely use some Facebook ads to target a pretty good audience! (And also utilize a tracking pixel to remarket to them.)

And Adwords is a great avenue for this market. Not sure what your competition will be like, but your customer is probably the type of person who googles things first.

355,"Hey /u/Phil_iONX,

I feel for you. I'm only a step ahead of you! I work in-house (PPC, SEO, Email, Social, etc) at a medium-sized business in greater Detroit - and am barely paid enough to live comfortably. It's been ~8 months.

So I started doing some freelancing like 4 months in to supplement my income (as well as forced an ""employee review"" so that I could ask for a raise - which I got! *yay* ), build my PPC skills, etc. while still searching for a better job. What I'm about to describe is in no way the only way to become a freelancer, but here's what I did - and had before I started.

I had dabbled in Adwords before for a small business I started and I was a part of a couple Facebook groups for entrepreneurs, small business owners, etc. 

This niche worked well, because it's a lot of doers - who don't need/want an agency to manage their campaign all the time, but wanted a more qualified eye to nudge them in the right direction. This way, I charge a flat rate for an audit, a 1 hour Q/A education skype call/screenshare, and am available for them to ask any more questions of the course the next few weeks. Haven't had anybody abuse it, I get to learn about different industries, practice my skills (PPC, but also sales/teaching/networking/scheduling), and don't have big 6 month-12 month contracts that I have to stick to in case I do get a better FT job that I need/want to dedicate to. 

In those FB groups, I was somewhat active in those communities and waited (but could have been more proactive and posted) until someone was looking for some assistance with their PPC campaign, and shot them a FB msg offering to review their campaign for free. After helping a few people, they'd recommend me to their friends / other groups, and it kind of just grew slowly from there. Word-of-mouth! I start charging quickly - nothing crazy at first, but could have probably charged more. As you grow in confidence, you can feel more comfortable increasing your rates - probably because you deserve it for the work you're doing!

It's really not a whole different from walking in small businesses and asking if they need some PPC help - but can be done from your chair at home after work.

I dunno, that's just kind of me rambling. I guess that's just a story and not really advice, but maybe you can gather some inspiration. Not only does it help you become better with your PPC game, but it makes you a few bucks, and is impressive in future interviews when you share the initiative you had to find new clients and do work!

Non-profits are a great start, since they get the free budget from Google - so there's little to no risk! Sounds like your pops can help you out - even if it's not that non-profit, I bet the folks on that board are on the board of other non-profits as well! Piggyback on that network if you can!

On Gorefiend, he appears to only be putting Mushroom down for feast, but as long as 3 people stand it in, it's good. So he should be dropping it outside of feast, for tanks+melee or for some ranged. Either works fine. 

He isn't using Healing Touch, but that's not really the end of the world. I mostly use it as a filler / Harmony / Lifebloom re-up on the tanks. He could use it to re-up Lifeblooms instead of re-casting LB - which would be more thruput.

He does have the very basic of basics down decently, so that's a start. But when you say he's not doing too bad on mana -- you have it backwards. Resto druids want to use up all their mana every fight. He should be spamming Rejuvs more than casting Moonfires/Wraths. Then when he's getting low on mana, use a Draenic Channeled Mana Potion (top off Harmony, Bloom, Mushroom), and keep on healing. Or if it's in a pinch, you can use a regular Mana Potion (less mana, but no 8s channel). And yeah, he's going to overheal a lot, that's what druids do. Part of that could also be because you're 4-healing stuff you could probably 3 heal. You're running 2/4/8 and 2/4/9.

He doesn't use Wild Growth much at all, and assuming it doesn't do too much overhealing, it's one of our most effective heals / mana. And considering he's got loads of mana lying around, he should use it a bit more.

Tier Bonuses will help him out. Maintaining Lifebloom on both tanks is great, and is more ticks to proc Clearcasting.

He's wasting Clearcasting procs (free Regrowths). He had CC 16 times on Council, casted 3 Regrowths. Kilrogg, 21 CC procs, 11 Regrowths. This is probably somewhat low priority since he's not using his entire mana pool yet anyway.",2016-01-22 17:02:25+00:00,cz7xar8,1.0,t3_425lbq,11606.0,CompetitiveWoW
389,"Why did you choose this lifestyle?
&gt; I went to college that required me to move every 3 months between school and internships. It started out with throwing out, losing, and giving away stuff so I could move easier. Eventually, I just pared my belongings down. Less stuff meant easier moves.

How do you incorporate minimalism in your daily life?
&gt; Limited + multi-purpose wardrobe, my home desk is a slab of wood with 4 legs w/ no drawers/shelfs for things to collect dust on,

Has being a minimalist improved your life in any way? How?
&gt; I have the comfort of knowing I can pack up and move anywhere in just a day or two. It's sort of freeing, even if I don't act on (have lived in the same place for ~3 years).

Where/how does being a minimalist conflict with what society (job, family, friends) wants of you?
&gt; Gifts used to be (somewhat still are) an issue. Luckily, my immediate family has all moved around the USA, so gift-giving is a huge hassle now. I usually get consumables for gifts now. At work, I have a desk with drawers, a cabinet full of stuff, paperwork, etc. all from previous people in my role. They still want to have this stuff around, ""just in case"" or whatever. I basically removed everything from my desk and put it out of sight. Out of sight = out of mind.

What are the difficulties of minimalism?
&gt; Throwing away, giving away, underselling, etc. things that I know hold monetary value. [[Stealing this from another post!]] Hobbies require gear! I'm an avid homebrewer, so I've got buckets, pots, lids, a second fridge, etc, etc. If I had the garage space, I'd probably be doing some woodworking, which would require a hefty amount of tools.

What is minimalism to you?
&gt; Making life more simple/manageable. My mind is clearer not having to worry about as many things if I weren't living this way.

(edited in) How long have you considered yourself a minimalist?
&gt; Maybe 5 years now? I'm not crazy serious about it and the minimalist culture. It's just who I am today.

(edit) Do you have any issues with sentimental items/gifts? What do you do with them?
&gt; Kind of sad sounding, lol, but I don't really receive many sentimental items. A few really specific things (a really nice card, wedding invite, etc.) get tossed in the fireproof safe. I think one day many years down the road, it will be nice to reflect on these items.",2016-01-20 17:28:58+00:00,cz5e82v,1.0,t3_41udkc,13630.0,minimalism

402,"A few people touched on the boomkin Natzukamu - and you mentioned he was MS Resto, so I'm going to review his logs on fights were they play Resto.

There's some major basic concerns here. I tell EVERY resto druid to do 3 things.

1.) As close to 100% uptime as possible on Lifebloom on your tank(s). It's your most cost effective heal and helps proc Clearcasting.

2.) As close to 100% uptime as possible for your Harmony buff. HT, Regrowth, and Swiftmend all re-up the Harmony Buff. Harmony increases the effectiveness of HoTs based on Mastery.

3.) As close to 100% uptime as possible for your Wild Mushroom (lasts 30s, so there should be 2x mushroom casts as many minutes there are in a fight, give or take (ie, if you get sent down for Gorefiend, subtract 1). For example, a 6 minute fight should have ~12 mushroom casts.

With that said, on Gorefiend:

1.) Natzukamu has a 30% uptime. THIRTY PERCENT. With 4pc, they should have nearly 100% on BOTH tanks, let alone 100% during the fight duration.

2.) Harmony uptime is 78.6%. That's not very good!

3.) TWO Wild Mushroom casts. On a 6:11 Gorefiend pull, I'd expect ~10. I know this fight isn't super intuitive (during non-feast) when it comes to placing your Mushroom, but it's generally agreed upon that if 3 folks are standing in your Mushroom, it's worth it to put it down. During feast, it's simple as it can get... Put it under the 20 raiders you're piled up with.

Furthermore, they're using Glyph of Rejuv (reduces cast time of Healing Touch when you have 3 Rejuvs out). Not only is this not recommended, but they're not even using Healing Touch! I commonly use Healing Touch as a filler on a tank / to re-up Lifebloom+Harmony, but still wouldn't use this glyph. Recommended Glyphs are usually Rebirth, Regrowth, Stampeding Roar.

Looking at Socrethar and Iskar, these appear to still be issues. Lifebloom uptime on Iskar was better, but aside from that, these are some major items that should be fixed.

So, how do you fix these issues? If you look through my post history, you'll see I basically make this same post like once a month. Setting up a few WeakAuras to track each of these spells is an immediate, simple, and straight forward way to re-inforce good practices. 

Here's the pastebin string for a basic WA tracking Lifebloom, Harmony, and Mushroom: http://pastebin.com/97sRm1tJ Currently, it doesn't track separate Lifebloom targets very well, but it would be a great next step for them.

I hope this helps! And feel free to ask any follow-up or have them add me on Bnet @ Mak#1504.

410,"TBH, I've healed most of this tier so I'm not really 100% sure on the specifics. 

With Iskar trash, its usually wait til a boomkin pulls an extra pack then pop hero. LOL. But yeah, you can pull double packs and hero, blow a healing CD or two and blow through some trash.

Socrethar, it's the big trash packs in the hallways, I think? 

It's not like on a boss when a poorly timed lust can cause a wipe. At the point you're at, I don't think it really matters so much when you're lusting on trash, but rather that you are. Basically, if you can make trash in between each boss last 2 minutes shorter, then you save like 15-20 minutes on the night (based on your flair) then the 10 seconds to reset each boss nets out to an improvement that adds up to a extra 2-4 pulls for the night. 

If you want to get silly, try incentivizing damage done for the entire night (including trash / trash only (you can check this on logs). You can seriously pad numbers on trash.

Multiple characters of the same spec (IE, two boomkins)? Not at all. In fact, it's probably more detrimental.

It's quite advantageous to have multiple classes/specs that you can play. Even if you're team doesn't doing split runs w/ funneling, you might find that you need a certain class to cheese a boss or cover for someone who is out, where having that second toon is very helpful.

Your Resto Druid (Freiyaa) looked OK on Assault, but not as much on IR. When I do a cursory resto druid analysis, I look for the same 3 things:

**Freiyaa on Iron Reaver:**

- 56.61% Lifebloom uptime -- should be 90%+

- 90.15% Harmony uptime -- that's good, should be 90%+ as well

- **ONE** Wild Mushroom -- in a 7.5 minute fight, there should ~15 of these! During PH1, Put that thing under melee! Ph2, I would just drop it in the middle of the room so folks can try to stand in it.

**Pretty much the same applies to Flaréon (who died, so data might be skewed):**

- Lifebloom uptime was like 80ish% when alive, so that's better. But still aim for 90%+.

- Harmony was 89% -- pretty decent, as well.

- Three mushrooms. Negligibly better. Like I said, there should be like 15 of these.

**General stuff**

90% sure Barrage only targets healers, so if you really want, you can have healers split and dps spread in between. With that said, everyone needs to be dodging barrage, even if it means stopping dps for 2-5s.

Make sure you have Pound CDs organized. Revival for Pound 1, Tranq for Pound 2, and so on. And also have folks try to step a bit closer to the boss for those cooldowns so they're in range. Mushrooms / Healing Tide / SLT are great for that phase. As a resto druid, I would run into melee 0-3s before Pound to get in my own mushroom and make sure Tranq reached as many as possible.",2015-12-17 15:21:08+00:00,cy29ou4,1.0,t3_3x7efq,12081.0,CompetitiveWoW

When I showed up, I spent 80% of my time fixing up the website / SEO. Then 80% of my time cleaning up a clusterfuck of an Adwords campaign (just started a new one based on data from the old one). Then 80% of my time making the sales funnel/process better for both parties (implemented CRM, automated e-mail, clean and consistent branding). Etc, etc. 

20% of the time was just for stuff that came up and needed to be handled.

I always like to recommend PPC, not only because it's one of the things I do, but because it provides immediate and measurable results/data. SEO takes time, print ads can be difficult to track, etc.

This is unbelievably specific (and bad) advice. Someone interested in marketing should not enroll into a CS program.

CS majors learn Basic OOP (Java, probably), Discrete Math, System Architecture, and so forth. 

And your advice is only somewhat relevant in technical fields, but even then, it's a stretch. If you're marketing a SaaS, you likely don't need to know what kind of backend it's built with... Or if you're marketing a physical automotive aftermarket product, you don't need a ME degree to learn the basics. You need a ME degree to design, test, or produce the part.

This is fairly common regardless of industry. Wholesalers want to see a Sales Tax ID, License, or some other document showing you are not using this for personal use.

""Generally, there is no sales tax on wholesale purchases of inventory. Wholesalers need evidence that you are not buying stuff for your personal use, and they are required to charge you sales tax unless you deliver a resale certificate to them""

Source: http://www.creators.com/lifestylefeatures/business-and-finance/succeeding-in-your-business/when-buying-from-wholesalers-watch-your-taxes.html

""Often a company that sells products at wholesale will not accept a purchase unless the buyer has a valid resale license. The license tells the wholesale business that you plan to resale the goods at retail, making a profit from the difference between the retail price and the wholesale cost. The wholesale company does not want to compete with its business customers, which are retail selling companies, by selling products to retail customers at prices that are too low. With your state resale license you can buy goods at wholesale to resell in your own business.""

1.) Your filler is now either Rejuv or Healing Touch (HT maintains your Harmony buff). HT and Nourish were quite similar, but Rejuv is your usually filler... but to be honest, you don't really have a filler. You're always doing something 80-90% of the time. I'll mention it in regard to point #3, as well. The way mana works now is fine w/o Innervate.

663,"I updated my original post with the same 3-4 things I tell every resto druid... some of which applies here. I'm looking just at your most recent logs (Oct 27th). After a cursory glance, it looks like you've made strong progress in the past few months.

I think your biggest spot for improvement comes down to **consistency of implementing the basics** (Harmony, Lifebloom, Mushroom). You clearly know what you should be doing, but seem to sometimes fall short on one item at a given time.

Your Harmony uptimes look decent overall averaging out to ~90%. I would try to consistently improve that by a few %.

Lifebloom uptimes are inconsistent! You had 91% on Assault and 87% on Gorefiend, but Reaver, Kormrok, Council, and Kilrogg were 37%, 55%, 77%, and 47% respectively. I know some fights make it hard to maintain it on a tank (Reaver, for example), but you already know that, so be sure to top it off before the tank runs out to drop the bomb.

Mushrooms! Also inconsistent. You did decent on Council (9 in a 5:30 fight) and Kilrogg (10 in a 4:55 fight), but fell short on most others. ONE on Iron Reaver?! Put that thing in melee/under the boss. Yeah, he moves around, but melee can stand in it still... especially for the ""pound"" things.

Skill choice: You're taking HotW, which I only recommend if you're going to use it twice a pull. So on fights that routinely last longer than 6 minutes, I would use it on opener to pull some Moonfire+Wrath DPS, then again later for intense healing, usually coupled with an epic tranq. It definitely can help with progression bosses where that extra opener dmg helps and that huge healing save makes the kill. With that said, I take Nature's Vigil 90% of the time. I can pop it for a couple 'Grabby Hands' on Kormrok, each Feast on Gorefiend, etc. I use it like 2-4 times a fight.

CPM + Mana: CPM is Casts Per Minute. I see you averaging in the low to mid 30s. I'm usually 35-40. Coupled with your mana, it looks like you have room to throw out some more heals! In a perfect world, you run OOM right as every fight finishes. It's kind of a weird way to look at it, but if you have 30k mana left at the end of the fight... why? You could have casted X number more Rejuvs. If you're idling standing around waiting for HP bars to drop (you should be pre-emptively healing to an extent, not just reactively), make sure you're tossing another Rejuv/Lifebloom on the tank, or re-upping harmony with a cheap Healing Touch (on the tank, usually). With regard to mana pots, I try to avoid dropping to OOM before potting, but it happens. I try to find a spot in the fight where I am both below 100k mana and I can find a safe spot for 8 seconds to drink up. 

The same thing I recommend to every resto druid is to get WeakAuras to track your Lifebloom, Harmony, and Mushroom. It made a huge difference for me.

664,"Hmm, this a qualitative question that's difficult to answer with specifics, but I'll try to give it a shot.

Gear and group healing does make it easier -- but one could also argue that it lets you hide your shortcomings. With that said, healing 5 mans should not be that difficult. It's important to maintain Harmony (the buff you get from casting HT, Regrowth, Swiftmend) which increases the effectiveness of your HoTs based on your mastery. I recommend a WeakAura to track your Harmony buff to all resto druids! Lifebloom should always be on the tank, as well.

The other piece of advice I'll throw out there is that you can pre-emptively heal as a resto druid. It's not totally reactive. Since our HoTs last a little while, you can toss them out on a relatively full HP target, knowing they're about to take damage. If you blanket your group with Rejuvs, then a big AoE dmg goes out, you can pop Genesis and top them all off. I only recommend using Genesis sparingly, but it's important to have HoTs up frequently. Furthermore, those ticks from your HoTs will help proc Clearcasting (free mana Regrowth!).",2015-11-04 15:29:23+00:00,cwo74xv,3.0,t1_cwo6dkv,1182.0,wow

3.) Wild Mushroom should be down for nearly 100% of the fight. It lasts 30s, so take the number of minutes a fight lasts, and multiply it by 2 -- and you should have an idea of how many you should have put down.

677,"If these are the right logs, here's some tips for your resto druids.

First off, Zelley is performing better than Bipolarbear, but they both have room for improvement. 

Basic 3 pieces of advice for ALL resto druids:

1.) Maintain 95-100% uptime on Harmony. (Zelley is at 80%, Bipolarbear at 68%)

2.) Maintain 90% uptime on Lifebloom. (Zelley is 78% on the night, Bipolarbear is 30% (!))

3.) Maintain 90% uptime on Wild Mushroom (Fight Length in seconds / 30 seconds) = ~# of Mushrooms you should have casted -- they're both somewhat decent on this.

I always recommend setting up WeakAuras for tracking Harmony, Lifebloom, and Mushroom. I can post mine when I get home tonight if you'd like.


Bipolarbear is one of your weakest players on this fight -- is this their off-spec?

Bipolarbear should be casting more rejuvs, **maintain Lifebloom**, and less genesis. Rejuvs and Lifebloom proc the Flourish trinket (Genesis does too, but see next point), and Genesis chews up mana.

Based on the CPM, you can see Bipolarbear isn't quite pulling their weight. They need to be spamming rejuvs all day. There's hardly any downtime on this fight. Rejuvs should be on tanks and anyone with the debuffs.

799,"Like the other comments mention, your site could still use some polishing and have a clearer USP (unique selling proposition). 

However, I'll try to answer your question - but I'd recommend listening to some of the advice here before moving forward with HEAVY traffic driving. But dabbling with some ideas won't hurt -- and will prepare you for when you are ready to consider larger ad spending.

Let me preface this: I haven't been a serious gamer in like a decade, so I don't know which avenue is best with the current gamer audience, but here's a few ideas, in no particular order.

1.) I think it's best to try a lot of the avenues. Adwords, Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, etc. Just a enough of time / ad spend to each and see what works. To be honest, I don't think adwords is a good bet unless you're super great at them and super focused on it like a full-time job. You'd probably start with a generic campaign for ""video game reviews"", but people are probably searching for something more like ""Call of Duty Black Ops 3 reviews"" - so you could set up ""micro campaigns"" for each game review that last for the first few weeks the game is out.

2.) I think Facebook will be a good bet for you. You can test out some targeting like this. Do a review of the new Halo game, make a FB post with a snippet / teaser of the review, then promote it (boosted post) to a few separate groups: Users that like 'Halo', Users that like 'XboxOne', Users that like '*Other FPS Here*, etc. and see what clicks. Probably want to focus all those groups with something like United States, English speaking, etc, of course. Would also probably test out targeting 13-17 year olds, 18-21 year olds, 22-29 year olds, etc. and see which age group you resonate with. Might also want to try tagging the games in your post.

3.) You can do a similar thing on Twitter, where you mention and hashtag the games you review. Instagram might be good, too - but I don't really know considering you can only put URLs in your page description, last I recall? But you could make a new post for each game review with the appropriate mentions and hashtags.",2015-09-24 14:57:07+00:00,cvclks5,1.0,t3_3m6wz3,8722.0,EntrepreneurRideAlong

For yeast... that's probably more difficult - there's tons of choices, but let's focus on the ""common"" yeasts. US-05 (American) is a clean, simple yeast that will let the malt and/or hop flavors shine more. US-04 (English) is similar but has slightly different taste (I can't speak to specifics).

True - most apple juices are 100% fermentable - but if you keep some for back-sweetening at bottling/kegging time, you can balance it out easily.

893,"Hey there pal!

Here's a few simple tips: 

If you're tanking with someone for the first time (or even if you're not), make sure you're on the same page. Tanks are 10% of the raid, but account for like 50% of the responsibility.

Calling out taunts is communication for both your co-tank **and healers**. Anytime a tank taunt happens, healers now know which tank to focus heals on.

Calling out movements/position adjustments helps dps. Specifically melee, since they need to be in the hitbox. Only really matters for ranged if you have to move boss out of range.

And lastly, I'd get an addon/weakaura that tracks healers' externals, so you can call for them (and get a WeakAura to track externals on yourself - like the one we used in main raid). In a coordinated group, most externals are planned, obviously, but in a pug, it's willy-nilly; so knowing what's available is particularly helpful.",2015-07-22 02:54:53+00:00,ctbow9k,2.0,t1_ctbdufw,18862.0,wow

899,"Assuming automatic, but most applies to stick as well. Shifting from 2H to 4H can be done ""seamlessly"" while in gear (D or even R) at speeds under 55mph. Personally, I avoid going over 45mph in 4H. 

Going from 4H to 4L requires you to be rolling (2-3 mph)/ (stopped can work), transmission in neutral, and make a firm pull (over then down). Same applies for going from 4L to 4H. Max speed in 4L is 15mph, but I'm usually only going 0-10 mph if in 4L. 

So the sequence of events is something like:
Put it in D
Let off brake / let it roll / give it (very little) gas
Put it in N. 
Over and down on the t-case from 4-Hi to 4-Lo. 
Put it back in D.

The 3.6L has more power, but is less proven to be reliable. JKs with the 3.6L also come with a better automatic transmission (5 speed).
