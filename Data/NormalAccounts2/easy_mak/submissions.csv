My agency has been began writing e-books for more clients - and we're creating landing pages, display ads, fb ads, etc. (targeting is done pretty well - PPC is my core skill set) to drive traffic to these pages - but they aren't converting as well as I'd like. These e-books are typically gated behind an e-mail form, maybe another question (which products are you interested in? Check all that apply.).

But my question is this -- have you seen quality success with e-books outside of the marketing/startup/business owner/mgr verticals? Especially in service-based / graying (40-60yo) industries?

I'm fairly confident the ads/copy/content is all pretty decent (there's always room for improvement), but conversions just aren't happening. 

I'm thinking of removing the e-mail gate and building a re-marketing audience with visitors to that page, instead of trying to build an e-mail list.

The other answer is that I/we suck at executing these kinds of campaigns... thoughts?",marketing,Success with E-Books in Non-Marketing and/or Graying Industries,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/53oaum/success_with_ebooks_in_nonmarketing_andor_graying/

I'm pretty sure I finally figured out why I couldn't get these QSs to where I wanted, but want to make to eliminate my confirmation bias. :P

I have a client that has seasonality to their business (peaks in fall/winter). I took over their account mid-summer and while they had a fair of high quality score keywords that were working well, their account structure was limiting the reach of their campaign and they hadn't really seen YoY growth - just the same results, albeit pretty decent.

I ended up building fresh campaigns, so that we had the previous structure in tact if we needed to revert (part of the client's request when we signed them), but a lot of the same keywords haven't reached the QS they had in the previous campaigns.

I am driving some of them to a different landing page (www.site.com/service vs www.site.com) - which I think would have helped, not hurt. But it wasn't until today that it dawned upon me...

Their CTR, conversions, CPC, etc. all noticeably improve during their peak season (CTRs are mid 4% during off-season, 7-8.5% during peak season) and their previous structure had 5 peak seasons worth of data and the new structure has a few months of off-season data...

Is it reasonable to assume that this coming winter season, I could potentially expect to see those Quality Scores return to where they were before?

I started up some paid social campaigns on Facebook and LinkedIn after the New Year. I work in b2b, and I wasn't expecting much from these avenues, but I'm seeing some inconsistencies between ad results and Google Analytics.

I'm pretty sure I have everything set up properly in GA. Registering 103% of clicks as sessions on Adwords, 85% on Bing Ads, 100% on Facebook Ads, but on LinkedIn...

**I'm seeing 5 sessions for 25 clicks -- 20%!**

Had half a dozen different audience builds with 10 variations of ad image/copy. My ads are set up to send users to the website, not the LI page.

Is this normal?

If anything, I maybe did some brand recognition marketing - had a lot of impressions - which I think were decently targeted... am I missing something or is it time to call it quits on paid LinkedIn efforts?

I'm 10/13M XP and the guild is on break for the holidays. Pretty flexible on times, since today's my last day of work before the holidays. Would be happy clearing 4/13M, and don't mind helping progression on Kilrogg / Gorefiend / etc.

I'm willing to be resto or boomkin (I'm better at resto). Looking to roll on Tier Helm, Tier Pants (nbd if we don't get to Gorefiend), and DSI (Caster trinket off Council). I'll be using coins, as well, so I might not even have to roll! :)

We're not sure if it's the holidays, the location (we meetup at a very new microbrewery whose beers are inconsistent so far), or the way our group operates.

So we got to thinking... what can we do better? What do other homebrew clubs do/have that we don't? How can we retain / attract more members? Why are you a part of a homebrew club? What keeps you going?

Edit: Somewhat re-assuring to hear that winter/holidays season are rough on attendance, but definitely got some great advice and thoughts here. Much appreciated!

I'm a pretty experienced and capable resto druid, but I've been asked to go boomkin by my guild and I'm down for a new challenge and doing what's necessary for the team. 

However, I don't know the finer details, nuances, etc. of playing Boomkin. I usually just used it for questing until HFC. Planning on running some heroic / LFR to just for practice, but if anyone would be willing to take a look at my logs and armory (working on replacing spirit neck and getting the entire trinket toolkit necessary) and provide some feedback, I'd be willing to review any of your resto's logs as a thank you!

I started at my current company as digital marketing specialist, but in reality, I'm the only marketing employee. This is my first full-time marketing job -- but I have the knowledge and skills to perform PPC, SEO, Social Media Marketing, E-mail Marketing, etc. And mostly with regard to B2C, not B2B.

I'm coming up on 6 months and in that time have whipped all of our digital efforts into shape. Optimized a massive, old Adwords campaigns that applied every google recommendation in the past 1-2 years, implemented Bing Ads, created professional social media pages, implemented a monthly client newsletter (as opposed to violating CAN-SPAM daily), implemented a CRM (where none existed before!), implemented Call Tracking, made SEO improvements, blog posts, and made industry listings more professional and optimized our ad listing spends.

And it's all been great. Total business is about 75% better -- and consistent, month over month (sans the holidays)! But here's the thing. This is nearly 100% inbound marketing --- And I know, it's the future, man.

But this company is a Midwest based engineering services/testing lab/company where I think some traditional outbound marketing tactics could be successful. With that said, I have literally ZERO experience with outbound marketing / sales / cold-calling.

Furthermore, while the boss appreciates what I've done (brought in a large variety of smaller customers), but would like to land some big $$ contracts and I'm looking for what direction to head. 

So far, a few of my working ideas are:

1.) Hire an experienced sales professional &amp; provide education, training and materials to be successful -- and hope their experience and skills to implement a routine, sales funnel, or something (?) pays off

2.) Send above sales person [or current employee(s)] to trade shows - leaning towards walking around networking and not paying for a booth.

3.) Print ads in Engineering / Quality / etc. relevant magazines -- I feel like this is a high cost to little return, but don't know for certain.

We also have piles of flyers, brochures, etc. that are all just a tad dated, and as far as I understand, were used in a direct mail campaign and were somewhat ineffective.

Anyway, I'm rambling on, so...

**TL;DR**: My first few months I was slammed cleaning up a mess of a digital marketing plan, but now all I do is tweak campaigns, write a few blog posts, and send out an e-mail blast. I don't know the next step(s).

I live 1000+ miles from my family and usually host a small 'Thanksgiving for Strays' meal and watch the game, but my usual fellow ""strays"" decided to visit family this time around.

Anyone in the area (I live in Warren) want to do a turkey-eating, beer-drinking, and football-watching meetup? Already have one other redditor down to hang out for the game and grub.

I'm down to host and provide turkey and a side or two. BYOB, but also have some homebrew on tap, but admittedly, it's an odd selection atm.

I'm a bit over my head here, as I've hardly ever touched CRMs - but the small business that I just joined has been tracking all their customers in Excel and hand-sending out e-mail templates to update them of the status of their order (we perform a service on a physical good). In a perfect world, it would be like a work order + CRM system, which I've set up to automatically send out an e-mail when someone updates the work order. But I'd be ok with a system that just requires a person to click ""Send 'Order Complete' E-mail"" or something. Do they all have this? Maybe I can set someone like this up with MailChimp integration?

I'm doing some research now after searching this sub-reddit, but figured I'd ask as well.

Thanks!
