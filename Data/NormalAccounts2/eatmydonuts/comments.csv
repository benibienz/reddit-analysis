3,"Objectively, I think Antichrist Superstar would be considered his ""best"" album. I think when most people (i.e., people who don't really know MM) think of Marilyn Manson, they think of his ACSS aesthetic. Plus ACSS has the band's most popular single (aside from Sweet Dreams). 

Having said that, though, I believe that Mechanical Animals was on track to be his best-selling, most popular album before he took most of the heat for Columbine. It's hard to compare MA with ACSS because they're two very different versions of the same band (dark, dirty, industrial-style metal vs. glitzy, disenchanted glam metal). But to the general public, I believe that the sound and atmosphere of MA would be much more attractive than those of ACSS.

Personally, though, I don't think he has a ""best"" album. I think each album represents a different aspect of Marilyn Manson as a character and as a person. For example, I love The High End of Low (and EMDM) because I like to see the softer, more vulnerable man behind the monster. I love Holy Wood because I like to see how Manson responds to the negative side effects of being the figure who he was. I like TGAoG because it's interesting to see how Manson returned to music after completing his triptych, at a time when I'm sure many people thought he was gonna fade away without much more than a couple of good singles. I love PoaAF because it's cool to think of Marilyn Manson as a band before they rose to infamy. I like TPE because to me, it's the album on which he finally found his stride as yesterday's terror without being today's washed up fat dude in leather pants. 

Before I keep going on and on, I think we can all agree on at least one thing: what may be objectively considered his ""best"" album has no bearing on how his fans react to his work. People will like what they like, and every individual will have their own reasons to prefer the albums that they prefer. ",2016-11-07 08:33:45+00:00,d9pc2a3,1.0,t3_5bj15i,30239.0,marilyn_manson

46,"*Edit: after thinking about it and looking into it some more, I'm going to need some scientific evidence to support your claims about ashwagandha. For all of the literature I've come across and the anecdotal reports, not once have I seen any mention of ashwagandha creating a ""hypoGABAergic"" situation with similar withdrawals to those of benzos. They do not work through the same mechanisms, and that makes a big difference in how chronic use affects your brain. Your one report of having ""withdrawals"" and rebound anxiety is not enough for me to consider stopping my daily use of ashwagandha. I have seen several mentions of tolerance building, but not one study or anecdote has made it seem as drastic as you did. If anything, ashwagandha seems like it could be the safest daily nootropic that exists, especially considering that it's been in use for thousands of years by millions of people and is one of the most well-studied herbal nootropics out there.* 

This is very good information to know. I guess I should consider cycling the ashwagandha. But in terms of the theanine, I don't think I could go without it anymore. My whole life my heartbeat has been strong to the point that I could feel it beating out of my chest, even when not taking stimulants or doing much activity. From my very first dose of theanine, that problem has virtually vanished, and I haven't had to increase my dosage. I've taken theanine daily for almost a year now and 200 mg still gives me the same calming, anxiolytic effects as it did the first time. Plus I've read research (and anecdotal reports) that theanine increases production of BDNF and improves male libido. I have definitely noticed an improvement in my sex drive since starting with theanine, and as someone with a naturally low libido, I rather enjoy that effect. I don't want to leave my girlfriend unsatisfied; this has been a problem for me in the past. ",2016-07-31 07:20:03+00:00,d5y3hrb,2.0,t1_d5xx9hs,14211.0,StackAdvice

And last night when I took the 15+ mg, I had drank about 1/3 of a beer about 2-2.5 hours before taking it; again, though, the booze (while not having much of an effect in the first place) would have worn off by then.

66,"Thanks for the answer! Those results are interesting, because if you ask any opioid user, they'll probably say that each one has a unique feeling. In my own narrow experience (with oxycodone and hydrocodone), hydro seems much less euphoric &amp; energetic than oxy, and a little more sedating initially. There are entire lists dedicated to the different feelings of different opes on /r/opiates. But I can't argue with scientific literature like that.

So if one opioid is essentially indistinguishable from any other, why have all of the different opioid drugs available? For example, why bother giving people oxycodone if one of the main metabolites is oxymorphone (Opana), which is a more potent drug with higher affinity for mu-opioid receptors? I guess these are questions for another thread.",2016-07-17 08:30:19+00:00,d5fgdp1,2.0,t1_d5f7tr5,21552.0,AskDrugNerds

69,"In addition to everything /u/FW900 said, most people find that Vyvanse is smoother from comeup to comedown. Speaking from personal experience, I tend to go through ups and downs much more frequently on Adderall; one minute I'll be euphoric and everything will be great, and the next I'll be dysphoric and irritable. Especially with instant release Adderall, the comeup will be quick and fairly noticeable, usually only taking 20-30 minutes to be fully in effect. Vyvanse necessarily takes a bit of time to work, since Vyvanse itself (lisdexamfetamine) needs to have that pesky lysine molecule cleaved off before it can become psychoactive (which is an intentional attempt at reducing abuse potential, since the preferred ROAs of abuse are ineffective with Vyvanse).

As an aside: if you don't have any existing cardiac issues and don't take insane amounts of amphetamine, you'll be fine taking either medication. If you have a heart problem or a good reason to believe that you may have one, then you're better off avoiding amphetamine altogether. There's a reason it's a controlled substance: while it's safe for most people, it carries risks which need to be considered by a doctor before it can be properly used.

71,"This was a great watch, thanks! Bo is so much more than a comedian, which is what I love about him. His material not only fits my sense of humor like no other's (John Mulaney comes close, but isn't quite there), but he does it in such a thought-provoking way that it's almost entrancing. I don't just watch Bo Burnham to laugh, I watch him because he speaks volumes of truth through his satirical songwriting and joke-telling. 

Although it's disappointingly rare to find other fans of his work, I can understand why he isn't more mainstream. His meta-satirical sense of humor is very unorthodox and I think a large portion of his material would go over the heads of a lot of people. Obviously people enjoy his performances; you can see the progression of venues that he manages to fill throughout his 3 specials. But I'm willing to bet that the ""messages"" he slides into his jokes and songs doesn't reach a fair portion of his audience.

Bo has a lot of lyrics that resonate with me, but this one in particular really gets me. I've had depression for about 10 years now (and am also a particularly skinny dude) and one of the ways I've found to cope with it is to turn the dark, sad parts of life into things to laugh about. I find that life is much easier to deal with if I can find the humor in the bad parts and share it with others, who can hopefully find the humor in it with me. He touches on this in ""Sad"" as well (""Goodbye sadness; hello jokes""), but I think ""Can't Handle This"" is a much clearer &amp; more serious expression of that sentiment. 

Even though Bo may be playing a character on stage, I have a *very* hard time believing that his lyrics don't reflect at least a little bit of who he actually is and how he feels as a comedian/performer.

73,"Literally. I can't think of a single thing that I wouldn't want to take with xanax.

Weed: xanax eliminates any anxiety/paranoia and adds to the chill factor. Probably my favorite two-drug combo. 

Stimulants: takes the edge off, eliminates anxiety/jitters, perfect for comedowns. 

Opiates: take less of both than I usually would, and I'm floating on a cloud of bliss. 

Alcohol: I can take one shot and feel like I took 2 or 3, without the shitty side effects of actually drinking; exception is if I'm trying to get drunk, in which case I avoid xanax cuz I don't want to black out or die. 

Hallucinogens/MDMA: the best I've ever felt in my life was when I took xanax on the back end of an acid trip. I took the xanax cuz I was ready to bring the trip to a gentle end, but what ended up happening was I got the xanax high with the visuals &amp; euphoria of LSD. I must have timed and dosed myself perfectly. (During the actual trip, though, I refrain from benzos so I can get the full experience.)

Dissociatives: to be honest, I've only done this once, and the xanax came about 3 hours before the MXE. Still made for a very nice night.

I remember learning once that the kidneys can recycle water back into the body to a certain extent, but I never heard of any such thing with the bladder. I always got the feeling that the bladder was no more than a holding unit for waste until the waste can be expelled. 

Plus, wouldn't the amphetamine have been broken down into less- or non-active metabolites by the time it got to the bladder, making this irrelevant anyway?

And does this also imply that my daily supplementation with magnesium bisglycinate (usually 200 mg doses, once during my first meal of the day and once towards the end of my day) up could potentially increase amphetamine's duration?

129,"As a 22-year-old who's spent the last 5 years smoking weed pretty much every day, I can vouch for this. I'm starting to see more and more how pot has affected my life in ways that I couldn't have foreseen. 

Neurologically speaking, I don't think we have enough evidence one way or the other to really say whether THC is truly neurotoxic. I can say that there are studies which indicate that it is; at the same time, many studies suggest that CBD is neuroprotective. One fMRI study from a few years ago (which I can source if you'd like) revealed that THC and CBD exert oppositional effects in certain regions of the brain. Based on research I did for my final project as a psych undergrad, I feel fairly confident in stating that THC is neurotoxic, but thanks to the dozens of other cannabiniods in the cannabis plant, getting high in general probably isn't terrible for the health of your neurons. 

Having said that, I can also say that you are *undoubtedly* affecting the development of your brain by smoking at that age. Like /u/tailsuser2 said, I hate to be that guy who tells you not to do the same exact thing that I did. But had I known more about drugs when I started doing them, I would have waited a little longer. Your brain develops until about age 25, and everything you do and experience affects its development. Especially chemicals which directly affect the functioning of that developing brain. 

One significant possibility is that cannabis can quicken the onset of psychosis. Schizophrenia usually emerges in the late teens or early 20s; if one is predisposed to schizophrenia, using cannabis can trigger its onset sooner than if left alone. I believe that there is also research which finds a causative relationship between cannabis use and development of anxiety disorders. That's less certain, scientifically speaking; from personal experience, though, I was never an anxious person before I started smoking weed. Now I take a literal handful of herbal &amp; nutrient supplements every day to try to combat my constant, low-key anxiety. They help, but it's still there. 

Basically, pot probably won't hurt you too bad. Just look at how many people have smoked it for years and were never worse off for it. The point of this spiel is just to make sure you hear about the potential problems while you're still pretty young. Remember, your brain is gonna keep developing for *8 more years.* Don't you want to give it a chance to develop properly? ",2016-06-17 10:23:46+00:00,d4cura2,,t1_d48jhfd,,AskDrugNerds

It is actually a gabapentinoid, mimicking GABA directly as well as having some slight effects on dopamine. It is the single best drug I have taken to facilitate social interaction--anxiety reduction with a pleasant, mildly euphoric stimulation. 

Valium is a nice, relaxing, long-lasting benzo that is best for just chillin. Somewhat less potent than most benzos, but still very potent compared with phenibut. Makes ya sleepy.

Klonopin is very similar to Xanax in potency, but is less euphoric/recreational and lasts about twice as long. 

Late edit: phenibut is best used once a week, twice a week at most, and not on consecutive days. Tolerance to phenibut builds stupid fast and it loses its ""magic"" faster than literally every other drug I've done.

145,"Just to throw some weed knowledge out there: as we all know, THC is the main psychoactive constituent of cannabis. On its own, it is more often anxiogenic, overwhelming, and generally uncomfortable. With CBD and the dozens of other cannabiniods in cannabis--most of which are non-psychoactive--those affects are attenuated; in fact, according to my research, CBD in particular is often found to work in the exact opposite ways to THC in various areas of the brain. Where THC makes you anxious and paranoid, CBD attenuates those factors. Where THC on its own may be neurotoxic (more research is needed here), CBD has shown to have neuroprotective effects (again, more research needed to conclude anything). These are the reasons why sativas--i.e, cannabis strains with higher ratios of THC to CBD--tend to be more intense, heady highs than can lead to discomfort, anxiety, or full-blown panic attacks. Indicas, which have lower THC to CBD ratios, are must calmer; these are the strains best used to treat anxiety and insomnia. 

The point of all this rambling is this: cannabis by itself (in any worthwhile dose) will not be nooptropic. Your memory will be affected and your thought processes, while different than usual, will not be any more fluid or even coherent. But finding incredibly strong indicas and taking low doses of those (maybe with some coffee) would be a good start. But CBD oil on its own relieves anxiety and other things without any sort of mental fog caused by the high of regular cannabis.

Opiates, on the other hand, are my absolute favorite drug (aside from LSD), which is why I can't do them anymore. The way they make me feel is just unmatched in terms of warm, blissful escape. Any problem in the world is easily ""solved"" (obviously not literally) with a decent dose of oxy or hydro. They don't fuck up your memory, so you get to remember how good it feels. They make everything *okay*, and they make the world a very *nice* place to be. But there's a reason they call it ""chasing the dragon,"" right? They don't fix anything, they just provide the illusion of ""okayness."" They're horribly addictive, the cost adds up FAST, and they're easily overdosed on, if you're not careful (although this is more of a problem with street dope that comes in varying potencies and purities). 

So really, I like them both about the same. Not just because of how they make you feel, but because of the differences in safety and utility. 

**Edit: I did not mean to imply that taking excessive amounts of any benzo is a good idea.

As someone who has taken xanax in the latter half of a trip, I just wanna say that if you *do* fuck with benzos, taking just enough to soften up a comedown without killing the trip is an absolutely amazing feeling. On the latter half of a trip, I took .5 mg of xanax and had a beer or two, expecting the trip to end... instead, the visuals continued (although somewhat diminished) and I didn't lose that beautiful, wonderful, ""everything is great"" feeling that acid gives me. But the comedown was ameliorated entirely and the underlying trip anxiety went away as well. Just a euphoric, wonderful fucking time.

You probably won't feel anywhere near the same on any other opiate/opioid as you do on tramadol, so keep that in mind. Also beware of seizures when taking tramadol in amounts of 400 mg or greater; tramadol lowers your seizure threshold and therefore is best used in low doses with other drugs that potentiate it. I love using tramadol with xanax; I know combining different downers is generally frowned upon, but they synergize nicely and the xanax brings your seizure threshold back up.

322,"To me, Manson's discography has 2 distinct branches: dark, heavy, &amp; industrial, versus Bowie-influenced glam. (His most recent work has started to take on a bluesy feel to it, which is the direction he seems to be interested in keeping.) Antichrist Superstar and Holy Wood would be examples of the former, whereas Mechanical Animals and Eat Me, Drink Me fall under the latter. This is only a rough generalization, of course, but depending on what style of music you're into, you're likely to prefer one half of his discography over the other. My suggestions are as follows:

If you want dark, heavy, ""creepy"" Manson:

*Antichrist Superstar

*Holy Wood

*Golden Age of Grotesque

And if you want the lighter, more glam-infused side:

*Mechanical Animals

*Eat Me, Drink Me

*Edit: sorry about the formatting, this shit is hard on mobile lol*

332,"Not sure if you're asking me, but I'm not necessarily the best person to ask about getting scrips easily. Only psychoactive scrip I was ever written was for Prozac, and considering the circumstances (and my background in psychology/pharmacology arming me with a bit more knowledge than my counselor wanted me to have), I elected to not take it. For the diagnosis of ""mild depression"" after 2 visits with the counselor and one with the psychiatrist, they threw drugs at me that I know have approximately a 30% success rate (and that's only after 6-8 weeks, during which the patient is likely to feel even worse and dangerously suicidal).

***But anyway,*** I know one thing is to do when talking to a doctor is do everything you can to avoid being labelled as a drug seeker, which is (as far as I know) a permanent mark that goes on your medical record which will make any future doctor hesitate to prescribe any psychoactive drugs, which is something you'll really regret after you have major surgery and all they give you is prescription strength ipubrofen rather than the proper Vicodin or Percocet. I know that when I had my impacted molar removed, when they asked me if I'd ever had a painkiller stronger than ipubrofen, of course I lied and said no. I got the whole spiel about how they're the ""heavy duty meds"" (I lol'd inside as I almost certain I was getting 5/325 Vics, which is a joke compared to the 30s of oxy that I used to use 2 or 3 of at a time). However, I feigned ignorance. I knew that what they prescribed me would only work for a day or two, due to my old tolerance spiking back up just like opiate tolerance is wont to do. But I played dumb, I let them tell me what was best for me, and I maintained my cool.

Don't go in there asking for xanax. Don't mention benzos. (Yes, I am about to take a bit of advice from a John Mulaney stand up special, but I still think it's a good idea.) Go see your doctor for a common, preferably *real* problem; maybe you've got a sore ankle you want looked at or you've been finding yourself sleeping less and less well. Something common and innocuous. If you work for a company that makes you fly a lot, then you've got it in the bag: tell your doctor that you fly a lot for your job, but that you get incredibly nervous during each flight. Don't be too specific; describe it like someone who has no idea what they're talking about, but specific enough that it keeps the conversation related to your nerves/anxiety. Worst case scenario, you get refered to a mental health doctor, which drags things out and gets more complicated (because they're usually trained to spot inconsistencies and liars, as well as the fact that CBT is generally the best treatment for most mental disorders). Middle case scenario, you get some beta blockers, which would be perfect for a nervous flier: calming of the physical symptoms of anxiety can allow for the rational mind and step in to remind yourself that you're fine. However, it may not, and it definitely should't to that doctor. See him again and tell him that while the beta blockers kind of helped, you were still panicking internally. Say something like ""my heart wasn't racing so bad and I wasn't hyperventilating, the 2 hour flight felt like 10 hours because there was nothing I could do about the nervousness in my head. Is there anything else we can do?"" Best case scenario, you walk out of there with a lovely little scrip for some alprazolam (or any benzo, because let's be honest, who among us wouldn't take any benzo prescription that we could get? Sheeeeit, write me up for 10 5mg Valium, and I ain't gonna complain; I'm gonna have me one good relaxing night with a couple of beers and well-packed bowl).

I will summarize with a TL;DR: **This was a hell of an adderall+xanax+weed induced rant, and it might go from place to place as you read it. All I wanted was to help you out and I may have just confused you more (or given you advice that will land you directly in jail.) Please if you really are trying to get a xanax scrip, talk to some people who've actually done it, and please be very very careful. The market for pharmaceutical opiates has been cracked down on with such severity, and for good reason; I would hate to see the same thing happen to benzos once the men in charge realize that abuse, addiction, dependence, and withdrawal are equally as severe (if not more so, if you count the potential for seizures and death) to those of opiates. Just be careful, man. Good luck.**

339,"I know I'm a bit late here, but I just wanted to add to the discussion. I tried fish oil (with the ""proper"" ratio of EPA to DHA, totaling 180 mg and 120 mg respectively) because I know that my diet is lacking in omega 3 fatty acids. After my first dose, I spent the entire day feeling lightheaded. I chalked that up to coincidence and dosed again the next day, with the same results. Lightheaded all day. I know it was the fish oil because I did nothing else different, and the following day when I skipped the fish oil, I felt perfectly fine again. Did some googling and figured out that lightheadedness is a fairly common side effect of taking fish oil. Since I'm prone to low blood pressure and lightheadedness already, these are two things I try to avoid; the lightheaded feeling made me anxious as well, for fear of passing out at work. 

So for me (and some others, if this is a semi-common side effect), fish oil is a no-go. Which was a shame because I had to give away my whole bottle that I had only taken 2 of. But the point is that some supplements just have different effects on different people, and it's probably not a great idea to suggest that everyone should be taking certain supps without considering side effects.

Having been taking it for about 70 days now, the lethargy has pretty much gone away. The anxiolysis isn't as strong either, but I also have definitely noticed a slight improvement in memory. It's not like I remember everything all the time, but small details (particularly combinations of numbers/letters) are recalled much more easily, even to the point of remembering something that I don't even remember thinking about before.

This is all purely anecdotal, but I figured I would offer my input since bacopa seems to elicit such a wide variety of responses of different people. 

Edit: also wanted to add that bacopa seems to help me deal with stressful situations more easily.

450,"I just have to make sure to wait for the theanine to kick in before I have any coffee. For me, caffeine + weed is usually a recipe for extra anxiety, and anxiety is the main reason I became interested in noots in the first place. But as long as I do wait (and don't have too much too quickly of either one), they all combine really nicely and leave me feeling quite focused, relatively clear-headed, and just plain *okay* with having to go to work or do whatever it is I have to do that day. 

Edit: I would also try substituting caffeine pills for coffee. Because it's consumed hot, you tend to drink it slowly, thus the caffeine comes up more gently. You may find the gentler comeup more suitable for combining with weed. Aside from that, there are a bunch of other chemicals in coffee that potentiate caffeine, giving it a slightly different overall feeling than pure caffeine. Caffeine content in coffee varies by kind of a lot depending on how it's made and what kind of coffee it is, but on average, 8 oz of coffee will have between 100 and 150 mg of caffeine. I prefer to take at least 300 mg of theanine per 8 oz of coffee; even if I slightly exceed the 2:1 theanine to caffeine ratio, that's better than not having enough.

454,"Quiet shout to /r/Nootropics.

L-theanine is an amino acid found in small amounts in green tea; however, you would need about 10 cups of green tea all at once to reach a worthwhile dose of theanine, so for the purposes of this post, I'll be referring to concentrated l-theanine pills. One thing that it does (I forget exactly how) is it increases the rate at which the body clears acetaldehyde, the most harmful byproduct of drinking created by the metabolism of ethanol. Acetaldehyde is actually the main cause of hangovers (I recently watched a BBC documentary that, in part, investigated what causes hangovers, and the conclusion was that acetaldehyde plays a *much* larger part in causing hangovers than dehydration; notice how hangovers get worse and last longer as you age? That's because your body gets slower at and less capable of removing acetaldehyde from your system when you get older.), so eliminating it more quickly will have you feeling better faster. Taking 100-200 mg at night after drinking (and as much in the morning if you still feel shitty) *will* remove the biochemical reason for your hangover. 

L-theanine is actually the closest thing to a miracle drug that I could think of. Its main purpose is to ameliorate the negative effects of caffeine (anxiety, jitters, etc.) while slightly boosting the positive ones (mood, focus, energy). It also reduces anxiety in general and relaxes the user without causing drowsiness. It has also been demonstrated (in a few select animal models) to increase BDNF, or brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which is one of the substances used by the brain in growing new neurons and synapses between neurons. There is no known amount that would cause overdose, it is not toxic in large doses even over long periods of time, and it has virtually no side effects. (Taking a lot at once, like 600 mg or more, may lead to a bit of sleepiness, but that's it.)

If you're interested in purchasing theanine, I will give this warning for the millionth time: *do not* buy dietary, vitamin, or mineral supplements from major retailers. Due to a lack of FDA regulation on supplements, often the chemicals in the bottle are not what they should be. Buying supplements from a trusted source--Swanson is always who I recommend--is a much safer bet, because many of their products are third-party tested for purity and potency. In terms of l-theanine, there is a particular maker of it (""Suntheanine"") who is reliable. Any bottle of l-theanine with Suntheanine's name on it is a safe bet, no matter where you get it. 

Minor edit for clarity",2015-12-18 19:47:52+00:00,cy3qbma,1.0,t3_3xcmty,17262.0,AskReddit
455,"First of all, everyone is different. People have different deficiencies or body chemistries that affect how it all will work. Best place to start would be to get some blood tests done to determine whether you really need to be supplementing with vitamins/minerals. 

Secondly, and I'm not able to post the source right now because I'm on mobile, but you need to ensure that you get your supplements from a reputable vendor. Most big companies--Walmart, Target, GNC, Walgreens, etc.-- do not put as much or *any* of what they say they do on the label. Supplements are not regulated by the FDA and therefore are not subjected to any sort of quality control. Purchasing from vendors (Swanson in particular) who do third party testing and will send reports of the exact content of their products are your safest bet. For example, for your l-theanine, did you get yours from a source that uses Suntheanine? That is a particular formulation of theanine which has guaranteed potency and purity. If you got yours from a major retailer, you're not likely to have gotten much theanine. 

Third of all, don't necessarily expect to *feel* nootropics work, especially not right off the bat. And don't expect them to turn you into a superior functioning individual right away. You gotta try a bunch to figure out what works for you. 

Fourth, even the particular type of supplement you use matters when it comes to achieving a certain goal. What type of magnesium did you use? Every different form of magnesium has a different bioavailability and works better in different areas of the body. Magnesium oxide, for example, is very poorly absorbed and often goes in and right back out (especially in the form of diarrhea). How much vitamin D did you take daily, and was it D2 or D3? Vitamin D3 is far, far better to supplement with than D2, which is more commonly available (IME) due to price. And there's new evidence to suggest that the current RDA of vitamin D (400 IU) should actually be about 10x higher than it currently is. 

And finally, the best nootropics are exercise, proper sleep and a good diet. All the supplements in the world won't help if you eat like shit, drink nothing but soda and don't get enough sleep. (To be clear, I'm just making an example. I'm not accusing you of any of this or assuming that you're unhealthy in any way).

Sorry about the rant, I just tend to get a little fired up when people dismiss supplementing just because one or two things that they tried didn't fix all their problems. If you think you'd like to try to learn more, visit /r/Nootropics. The guys in there are smart and very helpful if you ever have questions.

Essentially, it's magnesium glycinate, which is the most bioavailable form of magnesium that we are certain of. Magnesium l-threonate shows promise as being the most nootropic form of magnesium, but prelimary studies on its effectiveness are flawed and/or biased. For being so underresearched and costing about 3x as much as the glycinate, your best bet is something similar to what I linked earlier.

551,"I'm assuming you've discussed this with him; if you haven't, then I think you should bring up these exact points. Express that you understand why he's concerned, but try to convey that you are *not* trying to abuse them again. If it comes down to it, ask him which way he would rather have it: you take one dose of clonazolam per night to sleep through it and feel functional the next day, or you stay off the 'lam and experience troublesome sleep disturbances and have to sleep it off all day.

I also noticed that you said ""*undiagnosed* GAD."" I'll take this to mean that you're aware of the symptoms of GAD and experience them to some degree on a regular basis, but haven't seen a professional about it. If I'm wrong, then I apologize. But if you really think you do have GAD, then go see a professional. Getting a real diagnosis will go a long way in legitimizing your use of the drugs.

My last bit of advice, as someone who frequents /r/Nootropics, is to look into legal (i.e., OTC) alternatives for the treatment of anxiety. For example, l-theanine and ashwagandha are two naturally-derived and fully legal substances that are often effective at calming anxiety. My own levels of anxiety have noticeably decreased since starting l-theanine; while it's no Xanax, it certainly helps me calm down enough to feel normal. Many people scoff at the idea of supplements and herbs, and no, they don't work the same for everybody. But wouldn't you think it's worth a try?

607,"I wrote a literature review about cannabis and benzodiazepines at the end of my undergrad career, and this is actually a very interesting issue. Specifically, I investigated whether cannabis could reliably replace or supplement the treatment of anxiety with benzos. 

Short answer: probably not. People with a preexisting anxiety disorder are much more likely than their non-anxious peers to have an increase in anxiety from smoking, and are less likely to continue use due to this effect. This varies HUGELY between strains and individuals, and the reason has to do with the way CBD and other cannabinoids attenuate the anxiogenic effects of THC. This is why strains with higher CBD:THC ratios (often indicas) are better suited to treat anxiety.
