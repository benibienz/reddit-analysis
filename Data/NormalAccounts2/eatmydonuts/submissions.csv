I have less experience with MDMA than with pretty much any other kind of drug, so this is really my first roll. I know, the situation is a little weird (sitting in my room alone while my gf crashes next to me), but honestly I wanted to try it in a comfortable situation first. I snorted the cap that she had and now I am definitely feeling really good.

Well that's exactly how I feel; and it feels nice. I actually couldn't imagine wanting to be at a rave like this. 

My question, though, is whether or not it's common to experience an almost constant state of deja vu while rolling. Almost everything I do feels like I've done it before. It's not worrying me any, but I'm curious to see if anyone else experiences the same kind of thing.

Oddly enough, although I felt no difference in my physical energy, I noticed a positive change in my mood and motivation; it was the first time I truly noticed an effect from rhodiola, particularly the antidepressant effects it's capable of having. I will continue experimenting with higher doses to find out if it actually had an effect or I just fell victim to confirmation bias.

I also have no intention of doing any of what I'm about to discuss, so don't think I'm just looking to justify bad ideas, hah.*

This might be the dumbest question ever asked in here, but I need some clarification. I'll use the combination of coke + heroin to ask my question.

I know that combining uppers with downers is generally a bad idea. Using them in combination makes it seem like you can do a lot more of either one, easily causing an overdose. But that's the easy explanation as to why you shouldn't do it; I haven't tried to Google the answer to this question because I think this would be the entirety of the results. 

In terms of physical effects, for a long time, I was led to believe that speedballs are so dangerous because your heart gets thrown off by the various CNS effects, and essentially just freaks out and/or stops altogether. At the very least, I figured that repeated speedballing would cause cumulative cardiac damage (outside of cocaine's cardiotoxicity). However, the more I learn about drugs/neurology, it seems less likely to me that that's the whole picture.

To me, what seems more likely to be the reason is that heroin lasts much longer than cocaine does. If someone uses them simultaneously, they could do more dope than usual to compensate for the effects of the coke. When the coke wears off, the effects of the dope are able to come out more strongly, and the CNS depression causes an overdose as it usually would. 

I assume that the answer to my question really lies in some combination of everything I've proposed above, but this is a question that has bothered me for a few years now, so having a more concrete answer instead of just being *pretty sure about it* would be awesome. I also apologize if this post comes across as a little bit all over the place.

I was gonna post it on Facebook before I realized that no one would bother reading it, lol.*

So I started my interest in nootropic substances when I stumbled upon /r/Nootropics last summer. It started simple: the ""beginner stack"" of caffeine and l-theanine. All in nice, name brand packaging. ""Ooh,"" I thought probably aloud, ""this actually works! I wonder what else might be worth trying?"" So you go back searching, seeing what comes up often and what generally seems tried and true.

First it starts with a few other herbal extracts. ""Ashwagandha seems popular, I'll try that. And maybe a bit of bacopa."" But those are just for anxiety; they might make you a little too drowsy! ""I'll get some rhodiola too, to balance the others out. And maybe some l-tyrosine if I find my diet lacking in protein."" Then you realize that so many Americans are deficient in certain vitamins/minerals, that you probably are too! Gotta get some D3, some magnesium, little bit of vitamin K, maybe some B vitamins, and some choline just for good measure.

But wait, there's more! Turns out the Russians have been working on some pretty crazy cognitive enhancement drugs for about 50 years over there, and they're not terribly expensive, either! And they're LEGAL! I hear this Noopept stuff might make my head clear as day; can't hurt, right? Especially with all the literature I've read concerning its use in stroke recovery. Phenibut? You mean a mildly stimulating, socially-facilitating, anxiety-reducing drug that lasts all day and was/is used by Russian cosmonauts to calm their nerves before missions? Sign me up!

But man, buying all these brand-name, pre-capped supplements sure is adding up. What next? Man, the bulk powder sure is cheaper than buying it pre-capped... know what, I'll just splurge. I'll get the quick-capping tool, the veggie caps, and the scale so I can start buying in bulk! The caps to put the powder in, the quick-capper to speed it up, and the scale to properly dose. Cognitive enhancement is under MY control now!

Oh, those multiple ziploc bags with unmarked, unidentifiable powders in them? Don't worry about that suspicious-looking stuff. It's just the lamest looking bedside pharmacy ever.

And this is how, in the span of a year, I went from owning 1 overpriced bottle of l-theanine from GNC to now literally filling my nightstand with bottles, bags of capsules, a scale, and my quick-capper.

**The important part: supplements I am considering adding to my regimen**

* 100 mg luteolin complex; I've only recently learned about this flavonoid, and it seems like the preponderance of the evidence suggests that luteolin is hugely beneficial to brain health.
* 500 mg Chamomile flower extract, standardized to 1% apigenin; I love chamomile tea, and have read extensively about the potential benefits of consuming chamomile. I don't always have the time or the energy to brew a cup at night, but would like to reap chamomile's benefits daily.
* 50 mg apigenin (derived from grapefruit); based on the cursory research I've done via Examine.com and reading through a handful of studies found on Google Scholar, apigenin has potential to be hugely beneficial to overall health and is quite likely to be the main relaxing/anti-anxiety flavonoid within chamomile. If you didn't notice from my current daily stack, I aim to reduce the generalized anxiety that I experience day-to-day, and am willing to give damn near anything a try. Even though the above-mentioned chamomile extract is standardized to 1% apigenin, that is still only 5 mg per dose; I would like to experiment with doses in the 200-300 mg range to see if it could effectively relieve my anxiety without being overly-sedating.
* 820 mg of [Planetary Herbal's ""Stone Free.""](https://www.swansonvitamins.com/planetary-herbals-stone-free-820-mg-180-tabs?otherSize=PF081) I have never had a kidney stone and have no reason to believe that I am at any particular risk for it, but kidney stones are one of my worst bodily fears, and it can't hurt to support the health of my kidneys and gall bladder anyway (in the same vein of logic as to why I take milk thistle).

**The Real Question**

Is there any reason that I should not be combining any of these supplements, or taking any of them daily? My current daily stack is fairly common, I believe, and I haven't had a single problem taking that for months. In fact, I would never want to go back to *not* taking my daily stack, as it has noticeably improved my quality of life. Mostly, what I'm curious about is adding the 4 supplements at the bottom of the list. These 4 supplements are not often mentioned on here or /r/Nootropics, so I have almost nothing to go off of in terms of potential interactions or side effects from daily and/or long-term use.

Edit: if it matters, I'm a smoker (about a pack every day or two, depending on stress &amp; recreational drug use), I sometimes take half of a men's multivitamin on days when I know my diet is nutritionally lacking, and I'm getting ready to start a daily 10 mg dose of noopept to see how that affects me. My recreational drug use includes amphetamine and xanax (unprescribed) both recreationally and  for their intended purposes, oxycodone on very rare &amp; special occasions, infrequent social alcohol use (I pretty much left my binge drinking days behind when I graduated college), and up until recently, daily cannabis use. Currently I'm taking a break from cannabis because I've realized that I need to give my brain a break after 5 years of near-daily use, plus it most definitely sucks out all of my motivation (and dries up my wallet). I also try to have at least one cup of tea a day, which is usually either some variety of chamomile or green tea. I know that adding apigenin and chamomile extract to my list of supps may seem redundant if I often drink chamomile tea, but due to its laundry list of potential benefits, I see no harm in adding a little bit more every day or two.

I have a cup of it almost every night. As with most things I enjoy, I got bored one day and started doing research on how &amp; why it works, maybe hoping to find an extract or a certain isolated constituent that could give me a little more natural help (in addition to my daily anxiety stack of theanine, ashwagandha, vitamin D3, and magnesium). After doing hours of reading &amp; researching, it's become clear to me that apigenin is the main constituent of chamomile that exerts the relaxing &amp; anxiolytic effects. 

Now my next step is trying to find the best way to supplement apigenin. Chamomile itself only has around 1% apigenin on average, which I don't believe takes into account any amount that may be broken down during the brewing/steeping process. Chamomile tea itself has a wide range of potential health benefits, and I love the taste, so I'm not trying to replace the tea with a pill--I'm looking for something I can take during the day to reap the fullest benefits of apigenin's anxiolytic/relaxing properties. As I mentioned that chamomile has a very low concentration of apigenin, I don't just want to get a chamomile extract, either.

But this is my problem. Apigenin isn't terribly well-researched, and unregulated supplements (as we all know) don't have to be what the labels say they are. Labdoor.com and Examine.com had little to no information about apigenin or chamomile extracts in general. Primary research literature focuses on the general effectiveness of apigenin itself rather than which formulation or brand would work the best (which I believe is a good thing, but doesn't help my situation, lol). So how can I go about learning this kind of stuff? I've been over to /r/Nootropics asking for several days, with no help, so clearly it's time to find other avenues through which to educate myself. I was thinking maybe you folks could point me in a direction which would help me narrow down my potential options. Chamomile extracts contain most or all of the constituents in chamomile, which is great, but I'm looking more for an extract or supplement that is mostly or purely apigenin.

In short, how do you guys determine which brands and formulations to trust more than others when it comes to lesser-known, lesser-researched chemicals? I have a limited budget, like most people, so I can't just get every product out there to sift through the duds.

As I mentioned, I love chamomile tea; its taste, its relaxing &amp; anxiolytic properties, and its chemical constituents' potential to be anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and antioxidant (which are still claims being scientifically investigated, yet seem to be supported). Apigenin is a flavonoid found in chamomile which is of particular interest to me; the [Examine page](https://examine.com/supplements/apigenin/) on apigenin in particular seems to support its potential to reduce anxiety by binding to certain BZD receptors. This came as wonderful news to me, as I'm always looking for natural ways to combat anxiety and restlessness. 

Similarly, a [cursory search of ""apigenin anxiety"" on Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=apigenin+anxiety&amp;btnG=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C21) seems to largely support the notion that at high enough concentrations, apigenin (and other miscellaneous plant constituents, such as chrysin) are effective at reducing anxiety in controlled studies.

I know curcumin is relatively safe; it's mostly the piperine that worries me, since it seems that piperine inhibits certain hepatic activity that could affect excretion or metabolism of certain chemicals/drugs. My search of the literature turned up zero consistent results, and of course, I stressed to my friend how important it is to ask her prescribing doctor before taking the curcumin supplement. But as many of us know, not all doctors know everything, and I'm sure many doctors know very little about drugs outside of the pharmaceutical ones that they prescribe.

I was hoping that perhaps some of you could offer some insight here. The way I see it, one of 3 things could happen:

1. The prednisone and the curcumin complex work together to produce even better anti-inflammatory results. 
2. Either the curcumin or the piperine (or the combination thereof) could affect absorption, metabolism, or effectiveness of the prescribed drug, leading to either neutral or negative side effects. 
3. No relation whatsoever occurs, and she reaps the potential benefits of curcumin supplementation in other ways than just anti-inflammation. 

As a note: she does smoke tobacco daily,  and uses recreational drugs fairly often. Mostly she smokes weed and takes mdma when attending raves every month or so. (I'm still working on convincing her that overly-frequent mdma use is horrible for the brain, but that's a separate issue.)

I think it tastes great and I like the calming effects it has. My sleepytime teas (especially the sleepytime ""extra"" tea, with valerian and tilia) are a really nice way to wind down, if only for the soothing warmth and taste. The other potential effects, such as the anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenic, and antioxidant effects (citations needed) are also worth looking into. 

Based on my limited research (and what little is understood about chamomile's mechanism of action, which comes about through the dozens of flavonoids and other constituents therein), chamomile acts in a similar manner to benzos, agonizing the same BZD receptors that benzos do. Granted, I've also read research that purports that chamomile works in oppositional ways to caffeine on adenosine receptors, which accounts for its calming/sleep-inducing properties. 

As you can see, I personally (and the literature in general) seem to have reached no clear consensus on exactly how chamomile works. But I don't think anyone would deny that after a cup or two of chamomile tea, they find themselves relaxed and more easily able to fall asleep. 

Onto the point. I'm interested in seeing whether chamomile extracts would bring the same benefits as chamomile tea--mostly anxiolysis and mind/body relaxation--minus the process of brewing and drinking the actual tea. Has anyone in here had any experience with chamomile extracts, and found any positive results? I won't stop drinking my near-nightly cup of chamomile tea, but being able to take an extract alongside my existing anti-anxiety stack during the day (200-300 mg l-theanine, 250 mg KSM-66, and 200-300 mg magnesium glycinate) would only benefit me further, and give me more to cycle with rather than taking all of the same every day.

Shame, cuz I was really interested in the benefits of omega-3 supplementation... but this is a post about curcumin, not fish oil.

(Especially with my penchant for benzos/anticholinergic drugs that increase the long-term risk of dementia.) Currently, I take 300 mg every few days, or on particular days when I'm doing things that I need to learn or remember. I have not yet noticed any sort of depression associated with taking it like this; in fact, the depression I've struggled with for almost half my life has gotten better since I started taking supplements and nootropics, but I know that that's due to a combination of proper supplementation (thank you, vitamin D) and changes in my life outside of nutrition/supplementation. 

What I'm interested in knowing is whether I can take more choline--preferably, 150 mg 2x a day--without risking the depression that many people cite with its use. I'm at a point in my life now more than ever where I can not allow depression to get in the way, especially since it seems to finally be lifting after all this time. My questions, boiled down, are as follows: 

•If I haven't noticed depression with 300 mg several times a week, do I stand a decent chance of avoiding it if I take it every day? 

•If I'm going to supplement it every day, should I take a lower dose? I recently bought powdered alpha-GPC that I cap myself, so my dosages are more easily controllable than before. If taking a lower dose every day will lend me the same benefits with lower risk of associated depression, then I can easily do that. 

•As a 6-foot, ~130 lb male (yes, I'm skinny, I know), how much should I really be getting in a day? Do I even need to really change my dosing schedule from what it's been? It seems to me that taking lower daily doses would lend more consistent benefits than higher doses taken 2-3 days apart, but I got my B.A. in psychology, not biology, so I could be way off. 

•Is there any way to avoid the potential depression? Obviously diet &amp; other lifestyle factors play a huge role in depression, but if choline itself can cause it, then I have to wonder if there's anything in particular that would counteract it. 

•Are there any risks to choline supplementation aside from depression that I should be aware of? From what I've learned about it, choline supplementation is largely beneficial. I imagine if there were any significant side effects other than depression, I would have seen people in this sub and the nootropics sub discussing them.

My reasoning:

•First and foremost, his tunic. I don't think we've seen Link in his iconic green tunic yet; so far it's either a blue tunic or plate armor. Blue is a color commonly associated with and worn by the Sheikah. 

•Around 0:51 and 0:53 in the trailer, we see artifacts that resemble what we saw in TP (particularly like the head piece that Midna wore throughout the game). In BotW, we may see the events of the Interlopers occur and their subsequent casting into the twilight realm. The architecture and other features that we see in TP may be remnants of the Interlopers' society, which hadn't been condemned yet. 

•Link may use the Sheikah Slate to access places that are forbidden to non-Sheikah. Throughout the series, we see Link use other special items with ties to the Sheikah that allow him to do what most people can't; the ocarina which controls time or the lens through which the truth is revealed are two big ones. 

•The Sheikah clan were long the protectors of the Hylian Royal Family. Personally, I would love it if one of the earliest bearers of the Master Sword were a founding member of that clan.

But taken too many days in a row has led me feeling more depressed or lethargic than usual. Worth it in my opinion, for the benefits it carries. 

I've been using the Swanson Ultra Alpha-GPC, which is 300 mg of choline (from soy lecithin, if that matters) per tab. I don't know if the price has changed since I bought mine, but the current price on Swanson for 60 tablets is $19.99. I have noticed a difference when taking it, so it isn't like I'm looking for a ""better"" brand per se; I just want to get some feedback from y'all about whether there's a better bang for my buck elsewhere.

(To give a musical example, we have The Beatles: many people don't understand why the Beatles are legendary and don't find them very ""good"" in comparison to what came after.

I figured since I've seen people extol the virtues of yerba mate in tea form, I would offer my experience with taking a yerba mate extract. I originally started taking it because I wanted to see if I could use it for a small boost without experiencing the anxiety or physical discomfort of using caffeine; while I know that yerba mate contains caffeine, I thought that the dosage of the extract (combined with the other xanthines found in yerba mate) would help lightly stimulate me without overdoing it. 

[This](http://www.swansonvitamins.com/swanson-premium-yerba-mate-4-1-125-mg-120-caps) is the product I've been using. For those who don't want to follow a link, the caps each contain 125 mg of yerba mate extract. One ""serving"" is 2 caps; since this is a 4:1 extract, this 250 mg dose should be roughly equivalent to 1,000 mg of yerba mate leaf.

I take 1 capsule at a time when I feel mentally or physical tired/sleepy (in addition to my daily stack of theanine, ashwagandha, D3 and magnesium). What I've found is that it does almost exactly what I'd hoped: it gives me a slight boost without ramping up my anxiety to unmanageable levels. On an empty stomach and/or on a particularly anxious days, there is a slight boost in anxiety that occurs; however, this is not terribly significant and is much less than if I were to have coffee or another, more hefty amount of caffeine. 

I have not taken more than 1 at a time, nor have I combined it with any other stimulatory noots except for nicotine; however I have considered taking it with a rhodiola extract one day to see how they work together, because as it is I haven't noticed very much from rhodiola on its own. But even with the small amount of yerba mate that I *have* taken, I've had a net positive response from using it when fatigued, mentally and physically.

I obviously can't make any definitive statements on the product, as this is all anecdotal on my part, and my ""trials"" haven't exactly been scientific in nature. But as a nootropic enthusiast, I would recommend giving yerba mate extracts a try if you're looking for a way to give yourself a boost without giving yourself too much of one. And aside from the energy boost, yerba mate is full of polyphenols as well, so I believe it's a good choice all around!

**TL;DR: If you want a mild energy boost in pill form that doesn't crank you up like coffee or energy drinks, it may be worth trying a yerba mate extract.**",Nootropics,My experience with a yerba mate extract,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/4bghg7/my_experience_with_a_yerba_mate_extract/

My first few trips were on RCs, though I couldn't say which one(s), and I've taken shrooms once. And of course, I've taken true LSD, which quickly became my favorite drug/experience once I finally got ahold of it. Granted, I've only taken it a handful of times, and never in a huge dose. But I've taken it enough to know that I absolutely love it. 

My DXM experience was unpleasant and MXE can get uncomfortable very quickly if you aren't careful. RCs gave me an unpleasant body load and constant, low-grade anxiety. My one shroom experience was entirely unenjoyable, as certain circumstances led me to curling up under a blanket in the fetal position during the peak/plateau, with my only sure thought/feeling being that I *just wasn't sure.* But acid, though... LSD has only ever been good to me. 

You see, I'm an anxious person. I don't suffer tremendously from it and the worst it gets is when I have mild to moderate anxiety attacks. (To be clear: panic attacks are not necessarily the same as anxiety attacks. Rather than all of my anxiety building and collapsing in on me at once, I'll feel anxious at a mild grade for hours--lightheadedness, intermittent chest pains, racing thoughts, etc.) But it is real, and I do tend to worry more about *everything* than a non-anxious person. Particularly, I get anxious about my body. ""What was that strange feeling? Is there a reason for that that I know of, or is something wrong? Is it even real, or is it psychosomatic?"" Stuff like that. You get the point. 

The thing about acid is that, despite having the potential to elicit anxiety (especially in those prone to it), I never feel any anxiety when I take it. In fact, it seems to relieve my anxiety. I'm more sociable, happier, less worried. I feel at peace, even when everything I see and feel is chaos. Tripping is all about set and setting, right? Well even in less-than-desirable circumstances, I never get uncomfortable. I *embrace* my situation without undue worry, which is something I have a hard time doing even when I'm sober. Of course, with every hallucinogen there's a certain amount of body load and background anxiety. But on LSD, those things are easily dismissed. It's so odd to me how easy it is; when I smoke too much weed, those feelings overwhelm me. Not when I take LSD, though. 

Basically, the point of my rambling is this: LSD relieves me of my anxiety. For half a day or so, I'm free. I'm able to let go. I enjoy myself, the people around me, and the world I live in, without needlessly fretting about non-issues. **In a sense, LSD helps me to be who I wish I could be every day, and that's my favorite thing about it.**

I'm aware that after smoking cannabis, one may feel more energetic, or at least will find it hard to fall asleep right away. But this goes beyond that.

He happens to be my favorite horror punk artist; the snide, tongue-in-cheek delivery of most of his music is highly entertaining to me. And when he decides to be serious--especially when teaming up with other musicians (see Murderdolls and his last two solo albums)--he's capable of fronting some very good, creative bands that write interesting music. His endless references to pop horror culture are fun, too. But why do I rarely hear his name, and when I do, it seems to be followed by at least a few people saying how shit he is? 

To be fair, I'll concede that he is probably the biggest ""recycler"" of themes and ideas that I know of. The first Murderdolls album was largely remakes of songs that he wrote with the Frankenstein Drag Queens, and after listening to just a few albums fronted by Mr. 13, it gets pretty easy to predict his melodies or when he's gonna throw in one of his trademark ""wow""s. He's also been rehashing the same themes of murder, necrophilia, cross dressing, etc. since his Maniac Spider Trash days (although his newest solo album, Monsters of the Universe, definitely went in a new direction, lyrically and stylistically). So I can see why people may get bored or tired of him quickly. 

Having said that, I still don't understand why he gets almost no attention, and why what attention he does get is often negative. Even if he is rehashing the same themes, he does it in different ways, and his sound changes with almost every new release. For example, I really loved his glam-infused second solo album, Fang Bang. And on his third, Skeletons, he showed his fans s heavier side of himself that had never been seen. You can hear the evolution of his sound as you progress chronologically through his career. And for me, when it comes to horror punk, he delivers exactly what I want: obnoxiously over-the-top, tongue-in-cheek lyrics that are obviously made for shock value. Of course not everyone would want that, and it's not like I don't enjoy artists like Calabrese or late 90s AFI who put a more eloquent spin on things. In fact, it was AFI's horror punk phase that drew me into the genre to begin with. But I still don't see why more people can't enjoy him for what he is. He doesn't claim to be a poet, or to be writing revolutionary stuff. He might not even always fall strictly under the category of ""horror punk.""

This is important (and not necessarily a problem) for the purpose of this post.*

My girlfriend is awful at sleeping at decent times or enough at all. I want to give her some supplements to help her out with that. (Inb4 ""exercise is the best nootropic""; we're both going to start going to the gym soon.) First, of course, is my extra-strength sleepytime tea (loaded with chamomile, valerian, and tilia estrella). But other than (or in addition to) that, I have a few things that may or may not help as well.

+ **L-theanine.** Although commonly marketed as ""non-drowsy,"" taking higher doses (500-600 mg) seems to produce a state of mind much easier to fall asleep in. I find that even at regular 200-300 mg doses, while not making me drowsy, it is much easier to close my eyes and drift off to sleep. 

+ **Bacopa monnieri.** Many users of bacopa report varying degrees of lethargy;  some say it completely kills their motivation, some say the lethargy creeps in after extended use, and others (myself included) say that the lethargy tends to dissipate with chronic use. Others still say that bacopa makes their thoughts go very quickly, making it hard to sleep. 

+ **Ashwagandha.** As an anxiolytic, ashwagandha works for me to help me sleep a bit at night. However, most reports that I've read say that ashwagandha produces kind of a stimulating anxiolysis which can make it hard to sleep. 

+ **Magnesium bisglycinate.** Although the magnesium I have (133 mg, by Swanson Ultra) is buffered--the significance of which I didn't understand when I bought it--so it isn't pure bisglycinate. However, magnesium is associated with feelings of calm/relaxation, which may help with sleep. 

These aren't all the noots I have, but they're the ones most likely to be useful for sleep. The purpose of this post is basically to ask which nootropics have worked the best for you guys in the community, to see if I could get some sort of consensus.

Even if I was, I could never allow myself to go back to the way I was when they were running my life. So don't feel like you're encouraging an addict by giving suggestions.*

Unfortunately for me, one side effect of opiate use is the complete inability to urinate while high (and for some time afterward). Most people report that they have a harder time getting the flow going, but no problem urinating when they take opiates, so it must just be a peculiarity with me. (I almost never get nauseous on opiates, so I guess it's kind of a tradeoff, hah.) It's gotten so bad before that I've considered going to the ER so they could cath' me and just end the pain. 

I prefer to stay well hydrated in general, but when I know I'm gonna be taking oxies or some hydro, I'll often drink less fluid than I'd like. Even then, ya gotta pee sometimes no matter what. I don't want to try a diuretic because to my knowledge, diuretics increase the *production* of urine, but don't affect the ability to actually urinate. So are there any drugs that make it easier to pee without increasing the urine produced? 

Usually getting in the shower and standing/sitting under the warm, running water tends to help. If there's a non-drug alternative to this, that would be even better! 

Thank you for reading and for any suggestions!

^Edited ^for ^formatting

Edit 2: I've noticed that I can pee much more readily while on opiates if I combine it with an anxiolytic like xanax. (I'm well aware of the dangers of this combination, but I damn well make sure not to overdo either one when I combine them.) This leads me to believe my problem with urinating is at least partly psychosomatic, in relation to some sort of anxious self-fulfilling prophecy.

Now I'm well aware of placebo, and the millions of other confounding variables here; however, I hadn't done anything different that day that I don't normally do: intermittent doses of theanine throughout the day and my regular daily vitamin D and bacopa doses.

I was just doing a bit of research into milk thistle, which is an herbal supplement I've begun taking to support my liver health (and partly to help it recover from some of the abuse it's taken throughout my years of partying, haha). I decided to look up whether milk thistle affects the enzymatic action of anything, and lo and behold, I found [this study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11038151). I know this is only one study, but the results indicate that milk thistle significantly reduced the action of the CYP3A4 enzyme. I knew from recollection that this is a highly important enzyme for the metabolism of a range of drugs, so I decided to search for CYP3A4 substrates.

And I came up with [this](http://www.pharmacytimes.com/publications/issue/2008/2008-09/2008-09-8687). Xanax is near the top of the list, and I believe there are a few other benzos on there as well.

I've tried a lot of different things: caffeine + theanine, ashwagandha, bacopa, noopept, tianeptine, and various vitamin/mineral supplements that are related to feelings of anxiety. They've all worked to varying degrees, especially in terms of their other effects; however, none of what I've tried has worked fully to relieve my social anxiety. 

To my understanding, nootropics are considered as such because they are cognitively beneficial with little to no side effects. As I'm sure we all know, benzodiazepines like xanax carry a high risk of abuse, tolerance,  dependence, and withdrawal. And the long-term effects of chronic use are not all that encouraging either. But I believe that used responsibly, xanax could be considered one of the very best nootropics in terms of social anxiety. (And as a side note, other commonly accepted noots in this sub, like noopept and tianeptine, carry the potential for abuse and addiction as well, making xanax not too different in that regard.)

In low therapeutic doses of .25 mg, xanax erases my social anxiety. I've never felt so *okay* with my interactions with people. My thoughts flow more easily, I trip over my words less often, and I worry far less about whether or not a conversation that I just had with someone was weird or went poorly. The alleviation of social anxiety makes my job and my life much, much easier to deal with. 

In terms of side effects, at therapeutic doses, the worst I get is a bit of drowsiness, which is easily combated with caffeine. And just like with most nootropics, cycling the use of xanax can reduce or prevent the building of tolerance and dependence. I have never used phenibut, but I imagine the safety profile is at least somewhat similar, as I've heard that phenibut is easily abused as well. 

Certainly, if it were to be considered a nootropic, it would be labeled ""high risk."" And the legal status of benzos makes them slightly harder (and more risky) to attain. But for the above reasons, with moderation, I believe xanax should be considered a viable form of nootropic.

**Edit:** after reading the responses from you guys, I recognize that Xanax will never be truly considered a nootropic. The cognitive impairments that come even from low doses are directly *anti*-nootropic; I had only conisdered the drowsy aspect, but caffeine cannot overpower the other side effects, which I had not fully considered. I suppose that in the case of someone whose anxiety was so bad that they could barely function, Xanax could be a ""nootropic"" in the loosest of terms; but in those cases, I recognize that it is a more serious medical condition, and it's more of a medication than a nootropic at that point.

I know it's obnoxiously detailed and trivial, but I'm bored and stoned and got to thinking pretty hard. If this is the wrong place for this, please let me know ASAP and I'll get it moved.

I use my Wii U with a 2005 Sylvania model 6620LE. According to [this page](http://www.cnet.com/products/sylvania-6620le-20-lcd-tv/specs/ ) (which I googled because the TV's manual is long gone), the ""supported DTV resolutions"" are 480p and 1080i. 

Being 10 years old, my TV doesn't have an HDMI port, so I have to use an [HD component av cable](http://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/dce07b8c-9a1a/k2-_04b1f49b-e653-445c-9013-97b1328e7b70.v1.jpg) instead. I dunno if that makes any difference; I don't see why it should, but trust me, it would if I didn't bother to mention it.

From what I can tell from comparing each resolution side by side (using my phone's camera, which I know isn't the best measure here), 1080i is a little sharper and more vibrant, but the image is shortened by about an inch from the top and bottom. Not to say it cuts the image off, but it compresses it. 480p uses the whole screen (without any noticeable compression) but is a little less sharp and the colors are somewhat less distinct.

I know the ""p"" and the ""i"" refer to the ways in which the image is created on the screen, but I guess my questions really are:

1) why are my two options–480p and 1080i so different in pretty much every way, and 

2) which one is optimal for the TV &amp; console I'm using? Is there something about a 20"" LCD screen that is the basis for some kind of significant difference? (Unless it's just a matter of personal preference, in which case feel free to call me a slave to the hive mind.)

TL;DR I don't blame you, I would have skipped it too.

Luckily for my semi-gf, even though I'll never come when I'm high, I can fuck for hours. I dunno if this paradoxical boost in sexual appetite and stamina are a result of my opiate of choice being oxycodone, or if this is something that happens to a lot of people. So I figured I would come in here and ask y'all if you experience anything similar.

I always have been; as a child with video games, and now as an adult with basically any drug I can get my hands on. In general, I use cannabis daily, and I go through periods of opiate abuse as well. I know I need to cut these things out of my life, at least to an extent. Opiates for obvious reasons, and cannabis because it makes me a shitty person in general (when I get high all day rather than waiting until later at night).

My dad was an alcoholic for years, and had some other slight drug problems, but is now recovered and able to take his pain/insomnia medication responsibly. If I ever quit the drugs, will it be possible for me to get high on occasion? Will I ever be able to control myself and only get high on weekends or at night?. If I ever injure myself or have surgery, am I going to be able to take any opiates they give me?

What happens when you just don't care?

I'm sorry guys, I just needed to rant.... life has never been so shitty, despite how good it actually is, and all I want is to get high but I can't do that. Instead I'm laying awake at 6am with restless legs and a nauseous stomach like a junkie loser. Just like my brother used to be; just like I said I never would be.
