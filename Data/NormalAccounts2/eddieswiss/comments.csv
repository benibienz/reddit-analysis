I've written two full series already at this point with our own original Tenth Doctor. In this ""fan-series"" it's an alternate reality where the Shalka Doctor was the Ninth Doctor, and our series picks up after his regeneration in the opening episode. [The cover for the first series was pretty cool.](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/doctorwhorebirth/images/b/b3/Season_1_Box-Art.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20150310003724) Our Doctor is the chap with the checkerboard jacket, an outfit design I'm madly in love with.

Oh, and his first companion was an [Ood called Theta.](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/doctorwhorebirth/images/0/05/Ood_Theta.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20150310014943)

[His outfit also changed during Series 2.](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/doctorwhorebirth/images/f/ff/Ten2ndOutfit.png/revision/latest?cb=20151201040850)


I'm in the process of writing this Doctor's final series at the moment, but just haven't had much time finishing it due to time constraints, harddrive failures, the works. We had talked about our Eleventh Doctor being Alexander Siddig (in terms of likeness and what-not) but personally, I keep going back to [Mads Mikkelsen](http://static4.worldofwonder.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/mads-mikkelsen-photoshoot.jpeg) and this really cool outfit idea that someone drew up for me that I can't find for the life of me at the moment. It was a long red coat covered in various buckles and straps, brown steampunk-like pants covered in straps and buckles as well, with knee high black boots again, covered in buckles and straps. He had a grey undershirt beneath the coat with a black waistcoat and a red tie. It really jumped in terms of outfit design and I wish I could find the image.

265,"Already posted, but I've decided to do some Classic Series favourites as well running up to where I am currently in Classic Who having just finished The Ribos Operation. I bounce around a lot when I watch Classic, so bear with me.


**Season 1:** An Unearthly Child


**Season 2:** The Dalek Invasion of Earth


**Season 3:** The War Machines


**Season 4:** The Underwater Menace


**Season 5:** The Tomb of the Cybermen


**Season 6:** The War Games


**Season 7:** Spearhead From Space


**Season 8:** Terror of the Autons - This is a given.


**Season 9:** Day of the Daleks


**Season 10:** The Three Doctors


**Season 11:** Invasion of the Dinosaurs


**Season 12:** Genesis of the Daleks


**Season 13:** The Brain of Morbius


**Season 14:** The Talons of Weng-Chiang


**Season 15:** Horror of Fang Rock


And this is as far as I am in Classic Who sadly. Binging it is very difficult compared to the revived series.

368,"Sometimes, but super rare this gets good/hilarious results in those ""horror"" survival games. Played one called NMRIH (No More Room In Hell) I knew one of the developers, and it's a great free game on Steam.

Anyways! We were playing a super realistic modded mode/server of the game. Headshots only kill zombies, and you get infected/die in one hit. Well, we were all progressing through this building to an objective so we could call in an extraction, and one of the guys we played with daily for a few months at this point had stopped in a doorway and we couldn't sneak past him. 

We were spam-typing, and talking away on in-game chat wondering where he went. A few minutes later we could hear him snoring really loudly and low and behold the bastard fell asleep at this desk while blocking a door-way.

There was no alternate route to take and we were soon swarmed by zombies, and really fast, annoying child zombies. Thankfully about four or five of us died during the swarm by the sounds of all the commotion woke the guy up and those of us who had survived got to the evac zone later on in that session.

It was hilarious in the moment hearing people screaming trying to wake him up as they got felled by zombies, and their voice-chat cut out due to their in-game deaths.

401,"The cross I was nailed to was getting hotter and hotter with each passing moment as the flames slowly crawled up the wooden structure. I had traveled to the Earth as I had heard whisperings of a cult making sacrifices in my name, and that was something I couldn't stand for. I had taken a vessel of a young man named Edward Brown who had been killed in a automotive accident a few days prior, I wasn't the kind of God to possess the living.

I decided to take a late night walk during their camp and hopefully lure them out. I remember a man in his late 50s approaching me, he had a friendly demeanor but I saw straight through him, I saw the darkness that had touched his soul. He offered me food, and shelter to which I agreed, knowing this was the man I was looking for. 

He took me back to a run-down trailer that stunk of chemicals. As I walked through the door he hit me in the back of the head with a shovel, and I feigned passing out.

And here we are, nailed to this cross, the flames now crawling up my legs, the flesh burning away, but I felt no pain. The cult had now gathered and they all varied in age, gender, race, you name it. The leader had produced a large book bound with human skin and begun to spout nonsense from the book. 

*""We give you this offering in the hopes that you shall bless us with the desires of the flesh, and of the soul. Take this human into your dark arms, and show them your might. Dearest Salun!""* I laughed, causing the leader to stare at me with a vacant expression. He probably expressed me to scream, most of their offerings screamed bloody murder as they were burned alive, but not me. 

I pulled myself off of the cross, the nails sliding gruesomely through the holes in my hands and feet. I landed on the ground, and strolled through the flames, the flesh of my vessel falling to my feet, my disguise was burning away. I could taste their fear in the air, it gave me chills. I hadn't experienced this since the biblical times, I almost missed it.

As I finished my walk of fire, my true self was shown. I looked like I had been spawned from Hell itself. A massive skeletal, demonic frame with a long black cloak of darkness wrapped tightly around me. 

The Leader approached me, he seemed to be the only one without fear. He looked up into the hollow dark pits that were my eyes. He cleared his throat, and moved his hands in some intricate movement, possibly some ""salute"" he saw in that book of lies.

*""My lord, for what do we owe this pleasure?""* The rest of the cult seemed to relax seeing their leader approach me without fear. I let out a laugh, and I could sense the hairs of my ""faithful"" stand up, and they all seemed to shiver as if a cold wind had tore through the camp-site.

*""Oh believe me, the pleasure is mine.""* I spoke as I snapped the leader's neck with a flick of my hand. His lifeless body collapsed to the ground, and I picked his corpse up and swallowed it whole. His soul would not move on to the afterlife, his eternity would be spent with souls of the ones he had wronged in my name, a true hell.

The cult scrambled about seeing their leader felled by my hand. I walked calmly through the camp. One man shot at me with a shotgun, the shells bouncing pathetically off my head. I turned on the spot, and picked him up. He squirmed in my hand like some worm. His eyes begged for forgiveness, but I wasn't a forgiving God.

They had their fun, and it was time that I had mine.

464,"I remember when the trees first started moving. It was only gradual at first, no real inconvenience for anyone. Accidents were rare for the first few years and concern was at an all time low around the world. Of course, scientists, botanists, you name it were interested in the phenomenon and spent nearly a decade trying to figure out why these gentle, unmoving giants had begun to uproot themselves.

Climate change was the one of the more popular theories, and it had some good grounds, and the theory was really one of the only believable ones out there. The conspiracy theorist nuts all had their ideas out there too. *Oh, it's probably the chemtrails* all the way to *The government replaced them with weaponized trees controlled by the military to control the population*, which if you're a human being with any shred of intelligence you could most likely deduce that neither of those were true, or I hope you deduced that. There aren't many rational people left on this planet since this all began.

The last couple of years is when the real trouble began, and we learned something even more terrifying. We were used to trees, and all other forms of plant-life to have means of protecting themselves. Some were covered in thorns, some had poisonous bark, and some would even grow taller to avoid the reach of animals looking for food. However, we didn't expect this latest adaptation, nobody expected trees to actually uproot themselves, and move around. When it first started, they'd move only a few inches every couple of years and it just became more of us having to adapt to the change, nothing too serious. 

Then the trees seemed to become more aggressive, more dangerous, something inside their genetic make-up had changed, and they had suddenly become these beings who seemed to be capable of intellectual thought. They had become lightning quick, and would respond to even the slightest disturbance. People were being killed all over the world and the various governments and military outfits were doing their best to remedy the situation, but whatever they did the trees would adapt, and become increasingly more violent.

It was a losing battle, and were on the receiving end. It's been fifteen years since this whole ordeal began. I'm currently holed up in my family's old home here in Louisiana. My wife and children were killed a few months ago when an Oak tree tore through our living room and strangled my wife and kid with its roots. I had narrowly got away, and locked myself away in the basement writing days worth of content in this journal to occupy myself, and keep myself from going insane. 

I've got a few days worth of canned food down here, and I know someday soon I'll have to rise up from this basement and scavenge once more. I can hear gunshots ringing out in the distance, and the sound of the trees groaning as they move themselves constantly across the ground. I haven't seen a single person since someone tried breaking in through the window down here, but they were caught by one of the trees roaming around the house and torn to shreds. I hadn't dared to go clean the window and surrounding walls of the blood now painted on them.

It's been fifteen years since the trees started moving. Who knows how much longer this will last...

594,"Still thinking that this alternate time-line/world would be perfect to introduce Cobalt Blue as the main villain for the season. You don't have to 100% go down the ""Barry's twin adopted into the Thawne's at birth"" angle, but it would be a nice little thing. 

Instead of Cobalt Blue being Malcolm Thawne, they could make it out to be Eddie Thawne (since chances are he'll back for Season 3, and possibly with Iris) and gradually over the season leave hints that the two may have been brothers at some point, but not
exactly twins.

So in essence, here's my wish-list for Season 3.

* Cobalt Blue as the main villain. Due to Barry's altering of the time-line and creating this new world, they could try to due the whole Barry had a brother or something he didn't know about that was adopted into the Thawne family, and turns out to be Eddie/Malcolm and thus we get our Cobalt Blue story that would fit nicely into an alternate timeline story for the next season.


* Some stuff to do with that Black Flash reveal at the Season 2 finale. It'd be annoying if his addition at the end was merely a throw-away.

* Retcon the last two seasons of Arrow.

* Wally West is the Earth-1 Flash in this time-line, but still give Barry his powers eventually since he still has to go back in time and tell himself not to save his mother, considering that his actions are going to cause some major issues, and well...you know how Flashpoint goes.

* Harrison Wells from E-1, before he's killed by Reverse Flash since I imagine that Reverse Flash wouldn't need to kill, and take Harrison's likeness now in the new time-line. Or, hell bring back Harry from E-2. He's great, or even better...let Tom Cavanagh act as both of them in the next season, interacting with one another.

That's all I got right now.",2016-05-27 23:24:56+00:00,d3mdz8u,1.0,t3_4l1qdb,182957.0,FlashTV

Originally, Cobalt Blue is the twin of Barry Allen and is given to the Thawne family due to some poor handling by the doctor's at the hospital. The freaky-deaky timeline meddling from Barry could introduce this twin plotline into Season 3, and introduce Cobalt Blue as the main force of evil the team has to tackle, along with the totally screwed time-line.

Or, in this alternate time-line Eddie Thawne isn't deceased, and meaning he'd be showing up in some capacity, probably married to Iris. He could end up becoming Cobalt Blue which would be cool. And you could probably still play off the whole adoptive brother thing from Malcolm Thawne, and incorporate that into Eddie for the Season 3 Flashpoint stuff.

An episode where the Weeping Angels are a massive threat. They're a great creature, and I'm sure he'd want to make them a center theme for an episode before he bows out of Doctor Who, but again I'm sure Moffat will drop in once and a while under Chibnall's run to write a few episodes or so.

Moffat is most likely dropping out after the Christmas Special after Series 10, so let's make it a massive episode to commemorate his run, but not super masturbatory like RTD's final stuff was. Bring back his best creature creation, and have the Weeping Angels doing something with time and the episode takes place in the span of '12 minutes' to commemorate Peter Capaldi whom I assume might be bowing out the same time as well.

The Doctor can travel in time, but something done to his TARDIS only allows him to travel around within those twelve minutes. He can travel anywhere in time &amp; space as long as he stays within those established twelve minutes.

Personally, most of my scripts that I know are way too high budget for me to make would be great. Like the one I'm writing now which I'll lay out below.

**Sundown In The West**: So it takes place in the Wild West. Residents of a small town begin vanishing without a trace, and a small group of survivors hold up in the saloon and discover that the shadows are causing the residents to vanish. Think of the Vashta Nerada from Doctor Who thrust into a western-horror setting, cause we need more western themed horror films. Working on the second draft at the moment, so that's fun.

A handful of people fortified inside the saloon while the shadows are picking them off one by one, it's night outside so they can't brave the dark and their lights are slowly going out. It's tense, and it's been really fun to write. Plus, of course the people in the saloon start to turn on each other due to being confined and it's all good fun.

Her son has been known to kill hamsters and just abuses animals quite a lot actually. Shoves the hamsters down his pants and sits down. You'd think by now that his mother would stop buying him pets, but nooooooooope.

807,"* Well, when I first had the idea it was gonna be some type of organism that adapts to its environment, and thus evolves into some sort of shark/fish-like creature since it falls into the pool. It's still going down this route, but grows at an alarming rate much like the Xenomorphs from the Alien franchise. The swim-team thinks that it's restricted to the pool because it's fish-like in appearance, but again it adapts to its environment almost instantaneously.

* A swim-team just because I thought it would be fun to set a horror film entirely in a public pool where they can't leave or move around in the water because the creature is blind and only senses movement, sounds, etc no matter how it adapts it's always blind. The organism starts off pretty small moving through the drains at the community pool and starts growing, and growing. Still figuring out some things with this draft though.

* No leader, unless you count the swim-team's coach who doesn't really last all that long after the creature shows up. After he's picked off the swim-team falls into panicked disarray and just try to help each other with their goal of survival.

Now, I doubt he'd care but holy shit I was terrified of what he would have done/said to me.



* Every time my mom's boss/best-friend came over and my mum was out of the room or busy doing something her friend would hit on me and say really inappropriate things towards me that somewhat made me uncomfortable. Like, I came out trying on a new pair of jeans and they were kind of tight in the jimmyjohn region and her friend said ""You must have a big cock"" when my mother was in the bathroom.

922,"**Director:** Bring back Spielberg at least once before this new trilogy ends, or snag J.A Bayona before someone else does.

**Plot Synopsis:** We find out BioSyn had employed Henry Wu and Vic Hoskins as double-agents sometime before the events of Jurassic World and forced them to try and make some weaponized hybrids (Indominus Rex) using INGEN/Masrani's assets and somehow set-up the evens leading to the Indominus all but closing down Jurassic World and bankrupting Ingen and Masrani in the process, allowing Biosyn to swoop in and buy the remaining assets owned by the companies.

We fast forward a couple of years and Biosyn is running their own secret facility somewhere in Africa in an attempt to weaponize the animals more for financial gain for the military. However, nobody wants weaponized dinosaurs in the world (or fandom) so an inside person at Biosyn decides to throw together a task-force to destroy all of the research at said facility and somehow get these animals back to a safe-zone, now that Isla Sorna is a ""preserve"" for these animals.

This is how Pratt's character could get thrown back into the mix as the task force is assembled from people who have already dealt with dinosaurs and know how to survive against them.

That's my rough ideal plot that's been floating in my head since I saw Jurassic World. I'd love to work on it some more and maybe write a fan-script out of it at some point just for fun.


EDIT: Plus, Africa just seems like the perfect setting.",2016-01-16 00:27:23+00:00,cyzvh88,1.0,t3_415s4q,2670.0,JurassicPark

We learn that BioSyn has a secret facility in Africa and go from there. Of course, I don't want to see those awful hybrid/military dinosaurs from the Sayles JP4 script or weaponized dinosaurs at all, but I do want more Biosyn to some capacity and a setting in Africa.

Like, they could have enhanced certain features of the animals like  maybe better vision, smell, hearing, the works. Introduce a Tyrannosaurus who's vision isn't based on movement like how that point got changed during the second Jurassic novel. Don't turn them into absurd sci-fi creatures and keep them as animals with maybe some minor, realistic enhancements.

Someone learns of the goings-on at this Biosyn facility and a task force is assembled to somehow get these animals to a safe-haven (ship them off to Sorna or the totally decimated Nublar) and wipe out the facility in the process?

So, the following conversation happened.

*Me:* Hey, Cunt-Girl (this is her name for the story).

*Cuntgirl:* What the fuck do you want?

*Me:* Patrick Swayze died today. -insert my friend's and I dying of laughter.

*Cuntgirl:* No he didn't. -insert her friends confirming said fact, and her breaking down into tears and letting out the loudest wails of sadness you can imagine.

She was pretty upset for the next few days, and she had recently dated one of my buddies at the time and cheated on him, so being the person that I was I decided to escalate the Swayzeness and continue on with the chaos.

My buddy and I, let's call him Jacob. We drew a picture of a rather rotted and emaciated looking Patrick Swayze hanging from a tree and wrote a super awful joke, which is as follows:

""Why do they call it Dirty Dancing?""

""Because he's six feet under.""

And then we slipped the picture into her locker with our names scribbled into a giant heart carved into said tree. She saw it, got super angry and I guess had some kind of fit infront of her locker. She wasn't at school for like a week after that.

Yeah. I feel bad about that...somewhat.

I love talking about things, and can spend hours talking about anything and everything, but if my partner's go-to conversation every time we talk is complaining about their work, or celebrity gossip than I probably don't see myself being interested in them for long, this is just an example as it's what my ex was like.

And by intelligent I don't mean like talking about the fucking Pythagorean theorem.  Don't get me wrong, I love talking about all that kind of stuff (some of my favorite go to topics lean more towards science, space, and in-depth discussions on life, evolution, nature, dinosaurs if I find someone willing to talk about that stuff) but if we can even hold any conversation that requires some basic amount of thinking works for me.

Sure, everyone can complain about their work, and life and I'm glad to listen but when it's our only conversation that we have when seeing each other I'm going to lose my interest in them extremely quickly.

I fear this makes me sound like a douchebag, mainly due to my awful ability at explaining myself over the internet.

He steps away from the door frame and into the darkness. The sound of commotion, yelling, and gunfire approaching. Five Terrorists step through the door and the Nail Bomb explodes in slow-motion, as we see the Terrorists get riddled with nails and collapse to the floor, dead and severely bloodied.

Butcher strolls over from out of the shadows, takes a long drag on his cigar and looks down at his accomplishment.

*""I just needed to expand my horizons.""*

He tosses the cigar down on the chest of one of the Terrorists and steps through the ruined door frame.

Not every Doctor needs a speech though when regenerating. It worked for Matt's I feel because he was known for having some really, really grand and epic speeches. Peter's regeneration shouldn't be some grandiose affair with a long speech before he pops off into Idris Elba, Alexander Siddig or Mads Mikkelsen (my dream choices). Something that captures his personality as the beloved Time Lord, and poof. A rambling mad professor/rocker.

If they were to do a female Doctor, they'd have to do it really well, and hopefully they wouldn't do it because it's what people want, or because certain people are pressuring them into it with all the sexist nonsense floating about on the internet nowadays.

I just think it might be too much of a big chance for some viewers, and it might be a little jarring for some people. Sure, people are probably getting used to the notion because of Missy and how excellent Michelle Gomez is in the role. 

The Doctor has been a male role model character for 50 years, telling us we don't have to be strong, and use violence to solve problems but we can talk, and use our brain. That's awesome, and it's totally cool for little boys to have something like that to look up to. Sure, the same could be said for girls as well, but does his gender have to change to be a role model for either sex?

Of course not. 

I know it's the ""sexist"" opinion to not want a female Doctor, or at least in the internet's eyes it is. But, just because I don't think it would suit the theme of the show, and again I'd just rather see something fresh that multiple actresses can do for another 50 years in the show's lifespan.

1092,"I have a feeling Clara's death will be used a little more during these last two episodes, and quite possibly the Christmas Special. Basically, we still have yet to feel/see the full effects of it. The more I think about Clara and her death, the more I realize I actually liked her character after I declared not liking her for the entirety of Series 8.

* Clara is an extremely flawed human being in Series 8. She sort of doesn't treat Danny Pink all that great, and we can see the early seeds of her wanting to be more like The Doctor growing here. I think this is the main reason I didn't like her in last year's series, and it wasn't from a writing standpoint, or anything. I think it was just her as a person that got under my skin. 

* Then we get Clara post-Danny's death and she seems to be a better person in a way, but the seed I mentioned above has grown a little more, you could even say bloomed and she's sort of adapted more of The Doctor's way of life, and dealing with things. She herself acts like him, laughs in the face of death like we saw through-out Series 9 so far, where-as in Series 8 she was downright terrified facing against the Half-Face Man and his rubbish robots from the dawn of time. There was significant character development between these two series and I for one applaud it. Taking a character who's personality rubbed me the wrong way, and flipped it upside down and turned her into someone I liked.

* And now due to her change in personality, which I believe the key-point in this was Danny's death, she doesn't care about throwing herself into danger, and I imagine she felt safe around The Doctor because he generally always wins, always comes out on top, and almost never loses and this caused her to make that awful mistake with the Chronolock, and having Rigsy pass it on to her. That's why I think her death is so jarring, and uncomfortable. It's uncomfortable because it was such a stupid mistake, a mistake that didn't even need to happen, and most importantly there wasn't much to it. 

At the end of it all, even though we still have two more episodes to see how her death plays out, and truly effects The Doctor, I can safely and quite happily say that in the end Clara was a great companion, even though I couldn't stand her as a person in the previous series. I did enjoy her quite a lot in Series 7b!

And speaking of her death, I believe this is one of the few instances we've actually seen a full-blown companion die on screen. I'm not counting Rory's multiple deaths, nor am I counting the Amy/Rory sendoff in Series 7, as they still lived until their 80s but back in the past. The only two I can think of is Adric, and for some reason Peri keeps popping into my mind but I was sure she never died and her death got retconned somewhere in an audio drama. Someone could probably clarify this for me.

Anyways, I've rambled on enough for this post. I cannot wait to see what's in store for the next two episodes.

---

I sort of wrote a Doctor Who story about two years back with the Eleventh Doctor meeting The Master. This was right around the time when Day Of The Doctor came out (crazy to think that was almost two years ago this month). It was called **Ode To Sleep** and basically involved him falling into a severe hallucinogenic state due to a Bodach getting on-board the TARDIS, which makes him believe that Gallifrey is no longer gone, and the Time Lords are all alive. He has been given hope, and is even thrilled at the sight of The Master (Julian Richings, who is like my perfect idea for the Master). However, The Doctor's subconscious decides for some reason to use The Master as a way to try and reach out and tell The Doctor that none of this is real, and he's in a dream-state, and slowly dying. Basically, The Doctor takes on The Master/his own subconscious as his companion, and find a way to break the dream link.


Looking back it's not that great, but I still stand by my choice of [Julian Richings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiJ_FIOgd-w) (Death in Supernatural) for the uninitiated. He's British, but currently resides in Toronto, Canada.",2015-11-15 01:18:02+00:00,cx0gmrk,1.0,t3_3sse6z,34815.0,gallifrey

About the other finales though.

* **Pandorica Opens / Big Bang** - This is a really fun one. Matt was superb, and the bit about Amy remembering The Doctor during her wedding was pretty awesome. Not to mention we get to see Matt flex his acting chops with that whole speech at Stonehenge. So good.

* **The Wedding Of River Song** - Not a big fan of this episode. It feels kind of cluttered and I still feel like The Silence were never really utilized all that well.

* **The Name Of The Doctor** - I enjoyed it. Seeing all of the different incarnations in The Doctor's time-stream was cool. I thought we would have seen the Whispermen do more, and actually have some sort of higher purpose, but just like the Silence they felt kind of meh. Richard E Grant was fantastic, but the Paternoster Gang already lost their appeal at this point, and was mildly excited for the possibility of seeing one of them stay dead, but of course that didn't happen. The War Doctor reveal was a pretty cool thing too, but I'd still like to know how they got out of The Doctor's time stream.

* **The Time Of The Doctor** - Counting this one considering it was the finale of Matt's era. I actually really loved this episode. Not only did it serve as my first live regeneration story considering I started watching in 2011, and made me all emotional since Matt was my Doctor, and will always be my Doctor. Seeing all of these elements from Matt's era was fantastic, but the whole Crack In The Wall being what he saw behind his door in The God Complex was kind of...meh? It sort of felt like a last minute decision, would have been more excited to learn that The War Doctor was the one behind the door. Matt's speech while in the clocktower and yelling at the Daleks was fantastic. ""Regeneration number 13, we're breaking some serious science here boys!"" Or however that line went was awesome. Clara helping out the elderly Eleventh Doctor was touching and to see that moment mirrored in Last Christmas with the Twelfth Doctor helping the elderly Clara open the Christmas cracker made me tear up a bit.

But back on track to Time Of The Doctor. It's one of my favorite Christmas episodes of the show, and Matt actually made me feel emotional over a Cyberman's head. What a superb actor, and a brilliant Doctor.",2015-11-02 20:47:51+00:00,cwm0pht,1.0,t3_3r799b,31718.0,gallifrey

I just submitted my first ever script to Amazon Studios and would love some people to give it a read, and toss a rating over on the project page. If I get enough attention I have no doubt my dream will become a reality, and I can sit down and pursue a career in film due to Chris constantly telling us to do what we want to do, and just go out and make shit.

It's called Where We Dream and is about a young-boy who is diagnosed with end stage brain cancer, and creates a fantasy world with his friend to escape from his illness. It's my first foray into something dramatic, as I have more of a comfortable background writing horror, comedy, etc. Drama is a totally new thing for me. Tears will hopefully be shed.

He did this excuse for years and I have no idea how people believed him, or put up with his shit.

Came out of the bathroom and saw him doing said act. He ran off, and I asked for a bag from the lifeguards at the pool and shoved my pissy clothes inside and left the pool. I had to walk across town to get home in my piss soaked shoes.

He's menacing as all hell, the voice-work is astounding. Both Peter Serafinowicz and Corey Taylor did an amazing job with the voice of the Fisher King, and did I mention he's menacing? I'm a little bummed they didn't get to do more with him, and seeing him as some sort of major villain for the rest of Series 9 would be alright in my books, but I'm a little doubtful of that. I can dream though, can't I?

Loved the nod to Magpie Electrical with the guitar amp at the episode opener, and the short glimpse of the Clockwork Squirrel. 

I think it would save for me to assume that Series 9 may just be the best series of the NuWho next to Series 4, atleast so far. It could totally end up taking a turn for the worst, but I have a feeling we're going to get a solid run here.

Some people are like that, and not all Tivolians need to be like David Walliams character in The God Complex, characters do need different personalities after-all. Not all humans have the same basic personality, so I have to assume that aliens such as Tivolians don't as well.

And finally, I feel like they did exceptional work with Cass and the whole deaf character thing. It could have been a huge gimmick, but it didn't feel that way at all. Quite enjoyable too! I also think it's really cool that they actually went out and hired a deaf actress for the role. Very, very cool. ",2015-10-12 21:59:49+00:00,cvxfb9o,1.0,t3_3o9adv,177568.0,gallifrey

1401,"I've got a few. I was in Grade 8, so this was like twelve years ago. My teacher was a horrible human being. I was doing a speech about my grandfather who passed away back in '95 from colon cancer and got overly emotional, and couldn't do my speech, I was having troubles. He yelled at me relentlessly for ten minutes, told me to sit down and said ""If you want to get held back a year follow his example."" Safe to say my parents didn't take that too well and complained to the school board, low and behold nothing happened.


I sucked at math too, and he'd always make use do complex equations in front of the class. It was my turn one day and I was already worried because of his bouts of extreme yelling, and abusive behaviour. I was doing my equation, and was fucking up big time. Anyways, he kept shouting out ""Wrong"" when I'd do something, and he wouldn't tell me what was wrong.


Eventually, he'd give up shouting wrong and decided he'd stomp over to the chalkboard I was at, and grab the chalk from my hand and call me dumb, and an idiot and since this grade was the one before highschool he decided to say I wouldn't make it in highschool and probably drop out, and he decided it was best to say this in front of the whole class.


The end of the year I graduated for highschool, and he decided to try and be nice to me, and I didn't reciprocate nice feelings to him. Fast forward to 2012 and I learn he was in the end stages of colon cancer and I didn't give two fucks.

We heard someone knocking on our door, and we lived in an apartment complex and figured it was one of the neighbours, or our cousins who lived across the parking lot from us. My mother opened the door, and I went with her since the kitchen was beside the door to grab a snack.

We both instantly felt uncomfortable near the door, and I could see she was talking to a kid who couldn't have been any older than seven years old, and he was asking to come in because he couldn't find his mother. And, he was persistent on coming on. 

For some reason, my mother and I were like dead-set on refusing to let him in. So, she offered to hand him her phone. He nodded, and she went to grab her phone from her desk and when she came back he was gone. My mother was freaked the fuck out, and so was I. 


She told me the part that made her most uncomfortable was that his eyes were completely black, but she played it off as some trick of the light. Eventually, a few years later I was reading about urban legends, myths, and the supernatural and I came across something called [Black-Eyed Children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-eyed_children) and nearly shat myself.

I still stand by my opinion that the Series 6 episode, **God Complex** would have been a better exit for them.

The old age stuff wasn't only tender, but heart-breaking at the same time with the whole mirroring elements from **Time Of The Doctor**.

I prefer to write for my own incarnation because I just worry that I wouldn't be able to capture an existing incarnation well enough.

I know a ton of Xbox fans who are into the Souls games, myself being one of them. I wouldn't judge the E3 crowd to be the voice of the console, or gamers at all. People are saying that the FF7 remake is the best news out of this E3, but well know that the best news is Dark Souls III.
