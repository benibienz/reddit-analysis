One of the main appeals to buying Gears 4 for me was for the codes for Gears 3 Judgment, two of the games I never really got much time with.

Just looking for some spare codes since the games come with a brand new copy of Gears of War 4.

Gears of War is a franchise that holds a very close place to my heart as well. Back in highschool when the second game came out, my buddy Josh and I would play Horde Mode constantly. It was our nightly ritual after school, and would be a nightly ritual for months to come. However, later that year Josh was involved in a car accident due to distracted driving and was killed. I was in a really rough place and couldn't touch the franchise for a few years, it was too difficult and would constantly bring up memories of him and that day.

Eventually, Gears 3 came out and I played a few hours of it at a friend's house and fell in love with it, but never really had the chance to invest much time into the game due to moving to another city, and selling my Xbox 360 to afford some necessary living costs. Now that the codes are coming bundled with Gears of War 4, I find myself curious about diving in again and going back to a franchise that my buddy and I would play constantly when he was alive.

I'm not trying to run away from those memories much anymore, but I feel like he still want me to play one of our favourite games, and not let his death still bother me seven years later.


Much obliged if someone can help out.

**This week's discussion: The Eighth Doctor arrives onboard Cass' vessel in an attempt to save her from the crash-landing imminent on Karn. She discovers his identity as a Time Lord and refuses to travel with him because of the Time War and how she believes his race are no better than Daleks. She dead-lock seals herself away and the vessel crashes killing both The Doctor and Cass. Luckily, The Doctor is then revived by the Sisterhood and given the option to choose his next regeneration, and thus begins the War Doctor and his fight in the Time War.
However, what could have happened if The Doctor had persuaded Cass to go with him? Would it have affected the outcome of the Time War that we now know today? Would the War Doctor have ever been a thing?**

Throwing it around and hopefully getting someone interested, if not I'm gonna go the route of making it a web-series and reducing the episodes to twenty minutes for the web format, but I'd love to get about 45 minute long episodes.

Some details!

**Series Name:** Hallowsbrook

**Series Outline:** Hallowsbrook is an anthology horror series set with a constant Halloween theme. Each season would consist of five episodes telling different stories around Halloween time. This means most of the time there won't be any of the same characters crossing over into different stories. All-self contained for the most part.


The main source of inspiration is obviously Michael Dougherty's Trick r Treat, but not enough inspiration where it feels like a rip-off. It's my own little thing.


I'm showcasing the opening scene for the pilot script, titled ""Black Eyes"". The log-line for the opening scene is down below, as well as a link to said script. It's based on a short script I wrote, and decided to expand it into this anthology series/universe.


Would love some thoughts, and feedback and of course, I'd wanna know if this is something people would be into! It's a dream of mine, and if live-action can't happen, I'd happily tackle an animated route for this.


**S01E01 Title:** Black Eyes

**S01E01 Logline:** A group of high-school students are having a party of their own on Halloween night when they're visited by a child-like entity who throws them into a deadly game of cat &amp; mouse.

**Link:** - [Click Here](https://www.scribd.com/document/321977102/Black-Eyes-First-Draft)



So this is the opening scene. You don't see the high-school kids part as this is just to set up a kind of tone, and the basis for the story with what will be messing with the kids during the episode.

If enough interest is gathered, I'll toss up the full pilot script later on for you guys when I finish the third draft.",horror,"Opening Scene for series, ""Hallowsbrook""",https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/4zgoiy/opening_scene_for_series_hallowsbrook/

The idea for the 'cover-art' of the audio drama series is to have the two of them standing side by side or whatever you decide would be best with a dark background covered in blood splatters, and ritualistic runes.

This series is going to be the best one yet, and I've got some wonderful things planned for these scripts. First and foremost, I've got a really cool exit planned for the Tenth Doctor, so stay tuned for that.

We also introduce a new companion in this series, but we're going to be keeping that a surprise until the Christmas Episode/Script releases on Christmas.

The remainder of Series 3 will follow within the months after Christmas when all of the scripts come flying in. As it stands, the first two scripts of the third series have been finished. We have the Christmas special titled **The Winter Palace** which is the episode that will be introducing another companion for the Tenth Doctor.

It will follow the same format as the previous two series. For example:



**S03E00: The Winter Palace**

----

The designs and art-work for the Eleventh Doctor have been coming in, as well as the artwork for his own personal TARDIS interior, so we cannot wait to share those with the readers as well. The only hint you're getting is that we're basing his appearance on a very well established actor, who's excellent at portraying dark characters, but we wanted to bring this ""fan casting"" into the role, so we've done just that with Doctor Who Rebirth.


Aside from those updates, we're also looking for a guest writer for this series to pen the fourth story (S03E04) so, if you're somehow interested in being a part of that, please get in touch with me. It can be about whatever you so desire.

Originally, that story was going to be set in the Cretaceous Period with dinosaurs, but I couldn't figure out a decent enough story for that.
----
Alright, and down below is a rough synopsis for the Christmas Special that begins our adventure into Series 3.



**December 25th, 2015: S03E00 - The Winter Palace**
While investigating the disappearances of children from human colonies around Saturn, The Doctor discovers that an organization have been using the kids as test subjects for experiments, and that something sinister lurks beneath the floors of the Winter Palace.

----
So, how does that synopsis sound? Pretty gnarly, eh? I'm excited for you guys to read that one.

Finally, we're going to be rolling out some flair that people can use and have some fun with here on the subreddit. Enjoy, and thanks for reading the scripts.

**Round 1:** The Inquisitor stumbles across Solaire on the bridge preparing himself to fight the Inquisitor. The two of them engage in melee combat, this version of the Inquisitor is a Warrior. The Inquisitor is slightly tired from his journey, but Solaire is in peak condition.


**Round 2:** This time Solaire stumbles into the swamps of Ferelden while the dead are continuously rising, and he's ambushed by the Inquisitor who is now a Rogue. They're both worn down from the onslaught of undead, and the thick, swampy water and mud.

**Round 3:** Solaire brings in [Black Iron Tarkus](http://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Iron+Knight+Tarkus) to help him out in the final fight, and The Inquisitor has [Dorian](http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Dorian_Pavus) with him.

Doctor Who Rebirth takes place in an alternate universe where the Shalka Doctor was the Ninth Doctor.



The adventures are currently with our [Tenth Doctor](http://doctorwhorebirth.wikia.com/wiki/Tenth_Doctor). Also, here's a glimpse at his [Sonic Screwdriver](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/doctorwhorebirth/images/f/fd/Tenth_Doctor%27s_Sonic.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width/57?cb=20150310014433) and [TARDIS](http://doctorwhorebirth.wikia.com/wiki/Tenth_Doctor?file=TARDIS_Interior.png).



**S02E02 - The Night Stalker**
Arriving in Sleepy Hollow in the early 1800s, The Doctor and Gwen are immediately set on upon by a mob of townsfolk who have been terrorized by a string of murders and the bodies turning up headless. They learn that some sort of Headless entity has been roaming the village and killing anyone that crosses its path. This episode is a take on the famous story of Sleepy Hollow and features Washington Irving whom is the author of the famous tale.

Comments, criticisms, etc are welcomed! I have also snagged two writers from this wonderful subreddit to do guest episodes for the second series. If you'd like to write an episode for the third series (no more opening for the second series) please message me on here with your ideas and I'll explain the arc that we have for the next series, albeit hopefully not spoiling too much.


Now, if people think I should make my own subreddit for this fan-series please let me know. Again, I hope people aren't annoyed by me sharing this here. Don't really know where else to do it.

We started penning a fanfiction series about two years back about a scenario where the Shalka Doctor was the Ninth Doctor, and went from there with our own regeneration.

Also, we're currently penning the second series and looking for some guest writers, so if you're a good writer, and love Doctor Who then please be all means submit a story! We're just doing it for fun since we of course can't make any money from it.
