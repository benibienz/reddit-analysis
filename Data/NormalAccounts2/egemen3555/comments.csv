1,"I'm sorry if I made you think otherwise but I thought it was obvious that this was a fan-made 3D model. To be exact, this was for a job application. This amount of dirt and wear is too much for an in-game model in my opinion. My only reason was to prove my texturing and modelling skills to keenswh. Here, have some better  [pics](http://imgur.com/gallery/W6oIj) . I also do things like [this](https://futilityofexistence.wordpress.com/2016/04/05/mask-close-up/) and [that](https://futilityofexistence.wordpress.com/2016/04/08/horse-armor-pbr/) .

7,"I did that part a little bit more thicker just like you said, but my lighting and shadows and my bad camera angle skills made it very hard to see. I specifically thought about that part. But, bad news, I textured this again, so it'd look more realistic in the eyes of the people who don't know the reference in real life.

11,"Thank you.
It's a [Cuman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumans) mask, so I think culturally, it might be really close to Japanese war masks. Details are designed in Illustrator. Then, used as brushes in Photoshop. Then, normal maps created from the gray-scale 4K image. I didn't use the designs as alphas in Zbrush, because I didn't have much time. I didn't use Substance Designer to create bumps because it would take too much time to get the symmetry correctly. Overall, this is the fastest and the most reliable way to create these details. After all, this was just an hour-long journey. I can send you pm for all of your questions regarding how exactly I make things like this, if you want.",2016-04-06 00:02:52+00:00,d1rfy44,2,t1_d1r6aqr,13015,3Dmodeling

14,"Body is unimportant, just a dummy to hold the clothes and armor, chainmaille is ready to rig and animate real-time, that's why it looks a bit like it's stiff and hovering. I'll submit another project with an armored horse, this time the chainmaille will be in a pre-simulated shape. I also forgot to add to the title that this is one of my PBR works and it's rendered real-time with Marmoset Toolbag. Oh, about the head shape, this man has brachycephalic skull, just like a common Cuman or Kipchak male. So, it might seem different to a person from Europe or Africa. Only thing I played with is the detail on the ornaments on the mask. In fact real Cuman masks had very detailed ornaments and had a weird looking vibe to it, after all, these masks used to scare the enemies. I changed the facial structure to give it a little bit more realistic look without losing too much creepiness. ",2016-03-29 15:21:21+00:00,d1hr0ss,2,t1_d1gx2eq,61179,3Dmodeling
15,"I modelled that single boot from an old one that we actually keep as a family treasure because of its history. Real boot itself has the same amount of scratches in the same places, and it doesn't even have a single stitch line on the outside. They used some animal's hide(a horse or a boar probably) to stretch and fit on the inner layer and glued it with a fish glue to keep it in place. What I didn't get right is the stretched look on the front part of the boot. I tried to mess with brushes in substance painter but results were nothing like the original. Also the real boot has some holes and cuts but I felt like that needed much more attention and hard work than I could spend in a day's work. I'll make another boot and possibly a renaissance era shoe in my free time if I can get a good look on a pair of it. ",2016-03-05 18:04:36+00:00,d0opfg6,2,t1_d0oc9gn,37395,computergraphics

18,"I even tried older versions of blender, but still got different results. I always thought this is because of the openCL rendering mode. I knew HDR images don't work with openCL rendering mode, so I didn't use an environment image at all. But now, I'm really interested in this subject that I learned CUDA rendering mode also has this ""difference"". I'm looking forward to learn what is this about and what is causing it.",2015-12-07 01:15:05+00:00,cxpr2q5,2,t1_cxpmjc7,6830,3Dmodeling
