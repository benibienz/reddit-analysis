The asshole side of me wants to laugh and let you all wallow through what I did with no insurance and expensive as fuck treatment. But it's not your fault.

I've spent hours locked in my house due to hurricanes here in FL. They're exciting in the sense that you're trapped inside for hours and almost always lose power for a while.  You gotta figure out how you entertain yourself in the dark with no AC and how many beers you can power through before they get warm. Like a really shitty survival game. I personally slept through Matthew and woke up very confused as to why I had power and the outside looked normal. I can't even tell you how many people I've seen say they're disappointed by that one. Not on the Atlantic coast here, obviously. Being kinda scared is always a thrill. It's not often to find complete devastation here in FL thanks to a storm.

The paramedics got him with Narcan and he slowly came back having no clue what happened. At the hospital, he tested positive for meth as well. He doesn't do that at all so I assume it was cut. He's been doing this a few months now before it finally kicked his ass.

My husband went to the bank to see what they could do. The bank manager heard him say he lost his job and our situation with the holidays and our kids.

303,"It's cool. Credit is confusing af. I just got really serious about fixing mine (I'm in the same boat as you).

For example, your card that closed in 2009, when was it sent to collections? Usually once it hits collections, it takes 7 years to fall (varies by state). So if one of those collections from the card(s) in 2009 were to call you and you accepted a payment plan they offered, it would restart the debt to 2015. If you don't keep up with it, it will be another 7 years from then before it falls off your credit report. Since those are close to falling off, I would gloss over them. It will only impact your score in a good way very minimally if you pay them off.

As for the auto bill, I've never had one of those. Since it's relatively fresh in 2011, you can either wait (which can impact your credit) or call them up and try to settle. Make offers on monthly payments, a lump sum...whatever you think you can afford. Get these things in writing from the creditor. Communicating via mail is best and send it with receipt so you know they received it.

Hospitals are very good at helping. That is a relatively low amount. You could offer $100/mo until its paid in full (again, get it in writing) or whatever you can afford.

I would definitely work on the hospital first since it's the newest and most manageable. 
Second, work on the car. A repo is definitely a big hit on your credit.

In the mean time, a secured card is a good way to get started on rebuilding. It all depends on your budget. You may want to get the car and medical worked out before you start on that. Hope that helps!",2015-12-07 21:55:42+00:00,cxqrals,3.0,t1_cxqqemj,1260.0,Debt
