I was served maybe...5-6 years ago? and went to the mediation. They didn't do anything because my income was child support and I was in school.

We have one child and his daughter that visits every other weekend. There is so much more to budget than when I was poor and knew where my money was going. But I still feel poor! I bring in around $2300/mo after taxes and he at $2650. is I will try to break it down:

* Rent - $600/mo

* Electric - $160/mo

* Internet - $45/mo

* Car Payment - $289/mo; I want to say 13% APR for $12000 but I can't access the account ATM. We've been paying on this for 10 months now.

* Car Insurance - $220/mo

* Food - $250-300/mo

* Childcare - $80/mo

* Child support - $300/mo

* Entertainment for us &amp; kids - around $200-$300/mo

* Subscriptions like Spotify, Ipsy, Hulu...runs around $30/mo

Most of this goes to stupid credit cards. We both lost our jobs at different times last year. Living on credit was necessary since we had $0 savings. This is where we are fucking up and I don't know what to do. I feel like we throw money at them every month and nothing changes because neither of us know what we *should* pay. The amounts are just random numbers to me. 

We don't even use them now because we're trying to do a lot better. Do we close cards? And what do we close? The ones with higher interest or ones with higher balances? It's a black hole of CC debt. Most cards have both our names.

* Chase Bank - 88% usage $1760 balance, we pay about $150/mo; $2000 limit, currently at 0% APR but will go to 23% after the introductory rate ends

* Capital One - 92% usage $1380 balance, about $100/mo; $1500 limit, 23% APR

* Torrid - 80% usage $640 balance, $75/mo (we pay this down easily); $800 limit, 25% APR

* Walmart - 0% usage $0 balance, usually $30/mo when there is a balance; $150 limit, 23% APR

* Ashley Stewart - 22% usage $130 balance, $40/mo (paid down easily); $600 limit, 25% APR (also want to close since I rarely use it)

* TiresPlus - 59% usage $708 balance, $75/mo; $1200 limit, 22% APR

* Sunoco - This is currently at 100% ($300) but it normally sits at about 2/3 used and we pay it off each month which is $250; $300 limit, 25% APR

* Paypal - 80% usage $560 balance, $60/mo (usually paid by ebates.com refunds); $700 limit, I can't find an APR but the interest is usually $10/mo. I want to close this.

* Amazon (now closed) - 84% usage $840 balance, $100/mo; $1000 limit

* Wells Fargo (his) - 86% usage $860 balance, $90/mo; $1000 limit, 21% APR

* Credit One (mine...yeah I know) - 43% usage $270 balance, $60/mo; $600 limit, 24% APR and I don't touch this card.

So here's my story:

My husband lost his job on the 20th last month. We were finally on the verge of almost being middle class but our savings were nil. So...Christmas is not turning out so great. This was the first year I wasn't a poor single mom and I was really looking forward to this holiday. I managed to get enough together and get her a few really great gifts but it really is just a few. I don't have stocking stuffers or anything besides the few things I got her.

I put together a wishlist for her. She really loves art and books. She loves animals and Monster High.

I know there are a few things out of price range on her list but it helps give you a better idea of her likes.

Anything would really help at this point. Thanks reddit and /r/randomactsofchristmas :)

The most expensive thing I've bought is BareMinerals for around $25. I'm ready to move up! There isn't an Ulta or Sephora or anything near me so I'm hoping you all can help.

I have dry skin in the winter but normal/slightly oily all the other times. I have a moisturizer that I love from Olay. I've used Smashbox primer (the green one) but it doesn't seem to do much for my redness.

My biggest problem is texture. I have little pores in my t-zone, nose and chin that seem to get way more noticeable when I actually use make up. I've tried liquid and powder and it just looks atrocious to me. That's where I get lost! I don't know what I should be doing there. 

I also get hormonal acne that scabs up. I've gotten a little better at covering that without having my skin look gross. I've looked at a lot of tutorials on youtube and read from here quite a bit. My technique is improving but I think the products I choose are not quite right for me.

I currently use Maybelline Fitme Poreless in 115 and apply with a beauty blender. I've been trying some setting spray by NYX but it doesn't seem to last much longer than without it.

So now...I'm ready for the big girl leagues! I'm willing to pay around $40 or so for a nice foundation or anything you guys think may help me. I've read the lists from the sidebar but I feel really lost on my own!
