Anyone can explain me please how card Natural Philosophy works in Civ6?

http://civilization.wikia.com/wiki/Natural_Philosophy_(Civ6)

Description: 
Effect +100% Campus district adjacency bonuses.

But how this card actually works? When I have Campus near one mountain I get +1 Science. With this card I will receive + 2 Science from that mountain? Or it works different?

I'm playing Civ 6 now. But I haven’t played this game since Civ III. So I have questions... ;)

1. Where can I check my current warmonger status/points?

2. When can I check list of all my Luxury Resources and quantity of them?

3. Luxury Resources:
I have  1 x Furs + 2 x Cotton. When I start trading deal with another Civ like I give France (1 x Furs + 1 x Cotton), will my people lose any benefits from Furs (because I've given it away)?

4.  Luxury Resources:
When I have only 1 Luxury Resource in my Civ (1 x Cotton)  - it benefits all my cities or only few?

I want to buy GTX 1070. For me the most important thing (besides performance) is to have silent GPU.

I have my computer on my desk and I don’t use headset so it is important to have not so loud GPU. But it must be air cooled. 

So which model and brand do you recommend?

I’m thinking about:
Palit GTX 1070 JetStream 
or 
Zotac GeForce GTX 1070 AMP Extreme 8GB.

Which one is quieter? Or maybe I should buy something else?",nvidia,GTX 1070 Palit x Zotac or something else (quiet solution)?,https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/54yrkz/gtx_1070_palit_x_zotac_or_something_else_quiet/

I was playing a lot Civ III but I had 14 years break from this franchise. Now I'm so excited about Civ VI coming in October.

In Civ III I was playing on Monarch level. What do you think - what level of difficulty should I set when I start Civ VI for the first time? 

And to be clear: I'm sure I don't want to win in first game, but I don't want to be utterly crushed by AI also... It would be good to survive till the end and see all game mechanics.
