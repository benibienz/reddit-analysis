I ended up doing some googling on bots that did that and found the website IFTTT. In the middle of creating a bot that posted through tumblr, I also noticed a reddit option. I thought what a joke it would be to run a subreddit posting the time every so often. I made the tumblr bot, eventually got her attention and back in contact, and then changed the tumblr post option on them all to a reddit post.

#CRIMINAL

That I even thought of exacting a little revenge on a guy that threatened us with knives, almost had a fucking 10 year old arrested because he walked onto his yard to get a little ball and came from our house's direction, threw rocks at our windows, has cameras pointed in every window of our house facing his property, thrown a hammer at my dad almost hitting him square in the head and probably killing him, among other shit. Oh but that was all legal! The courts said nooo it was all in self defense, because he might have been hurt by us talking to him about what he wanted. He might've been injured if we had made a deal about doing construction on our property line, which we were 100% open to. He just didn't think so. Having a 10 year old threatened with being arrested and yelled at by cops, and throwing a hammer at us. If I had included that, would you be calling me a cunt now? What the did I do wrong? Asked a question here? Would people be sympathizing with me? Probably not, but would you call me a cunt?

I know that feeling of having seemingly nothing work and part of the reason I want to build this is to power through that. I may follow a design but I don't want to buy a premade one. Because of such I am also leaning towards the laser because it's simpler and I am not building it for the final product. Also, despite the price difference not being a whole lot, it's still a price difference, just adding to the personal benefit of building from scratch.

206,"A family friend of mine claims one of his best friends, with whom he is in a small band, was involved in the heist. Not sure if he meant directly or maybe some kind of planner. I've only met the guy a couple times but I know a few things. First, the family friend seemed pretty knowledgeable about the incident when he was talking about it and claimed he was told all the info by his friend. Secondly, the guy has been a painter and musician his whole life, yet he lives in a multi million dollar house with a Mercedes Benz that he loves to flaunt. Third, he also supplied every single instrument he uses in his band. A hefty feat because every time they play, even at the little local concerts I've been to, it seems like they all have a different instrument. New keyboards, various brass, a different guitar, very fancy equipment, and so on. And they all say he owns all of it. 

Now I'm just as skeptical as anyone reading this on reddit would be but I think it's a fun story to throw around because to me it's believable enough to remember and I couldn't name the guy if I tried without asking, so I have no actual info.

305,"I owned a go-kart when I was ~10. My cousin (15ish I think) and I were riding circles around a big truck used to haul apples at a small fruit storage facility in my neighboorhood. He was driving and I was the passenger. I decided for one circle I would take a break and let him really go because I wasn't comfortable with how fast he liked to take it. Just so happened that loop he ran straight into the truck's hanging back bumper thingy (seen [here](http://www.centralnewyorkinjurylawyer.com/files/2016/01/tractor-trailer-back.jpg)) at full speed. The corner of a big steel rod at 30+ mph with zero safety measures. He very narrowly made it without brain injury because he was tall enough for the bar to hit his chest and only touch his jaw, instead of the top of his head. He smashed his jaw, damaged his ribs and broke a few teeth. One of his lungs collapsed while at the hospital too. I found him with blood all over. After a few years he is 100% healed up with only scars on his chest but if I had been in there, definitely would have smashed my head straight in. Dead or serious brain damage.

These are the only two trains on the entire railway. I'll refer to the left train as train 1 and the right train as train 2. T2 is coming from the right and trying to go upward, but the signal stops it because T1 is coming downward at the same time. T1 pulls into the little junction and is stopped by the overhang of T2's third cart. However, T2's signal never turns green regardless of nothing blocking it anymore, making of course this total stopping point.

To further show what I mean, I removed T1's carts so there's no possibility it could be blocking T2.

In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies. We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-Madonnas, but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granite. So I ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there. Although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on your shoulder. In your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kids Nsync, and even though you are having a feel day with this I am here to bring you back into reality. I have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky, because I cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. I have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. You just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go. Make my words, when you get down to brass stacks it doesn't take rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once. It's clear who makes the pants in this relationship, and sometimes you just have to swallow your prize and accept the facts. You might have to come to this conclusion through denial and error but I swear on my mother's mating name that when you put the petal to the medal you will pass with flying carpets like it’s a peach of cake.

For number 1, I mean I would like to go to reddit.com/r/[subreddit]. I would not like to go to vumble.com/r/[subreddit], which is currently the default if I click a link within the vumble site that leads to another subreddit. It takes me off of the video I was watching and usually has no videos to display anyway, so it says ""Sorry there's nothing here"" or whatever the message is.

For number 4, luckily or unluckily, I cannot reproduce this. I have just noticed once or twice that I will type out a comment, click ""Save"" and then go back to reddit just to find that I never actually made that comment, nor did any other account. I did notice however that when I do successfully make a comment, it lists me as having 2 points to start, rather than 1. Maybe the vumble default is 1 and then you add 1 by auto upvoting?

Also, if you're going to represent everyone with mankind, yes the word man is in that. That's a problem from the contextual standpoint.

I bet you don't even have your desktop riced like mine, fucking newfag. just because I take pity on you, and only because I take pity in you, I'm going to tell you how to actually be a hacker. the first thing you have to do is download the torrent browser and start surfing the deep web. be careful down there &lt;thats another deep web joke, amature&gt;, you dont know what youre doing and you arent prepared for what you might see. the second thing you have to do, is to join an underground deepweb hacker collective, no lone wolf ever took down a sheep by its self. youre almost there. you should stop using apostrophes or proper punctuation because when youre constantly running and editing javascript scripts and uploading trojan viruses to scrubs harddrives, you dont have time to type like a new fag. if you don't follow that step youre going to be ripped apart in the seep web like a five dollar bill in a sinagog. next you have to install linux and change your display settings to high contrast number 2, nobosy will take you seriously otherwise. finally, and this is the most important, dont ever tell anyone you meet on the clearweb the things you have seen on the other side, we dont need that kind of publicity. if you want actual advice on hacking , you should go to 00101111 01110010 01110010 01100011 01100011 00110101 01110101 01110101 01110101 01100100 01101000 01101000 00110100 01101111 01111010 00110011 01100011 00101110 01101111 01101110 01101001 01101111 01101110 . if you dont know what any of those numbers mean, you dont have what it takes to be a hacker. sorry, but not everyone is cut out for it. thats just the way the game works.",2015-12-03 15:38:57+00:00,cxlpzzh,1.0,t3_3tdsl8,1254889.0,every15min

She had you, and then she thought you were gonna be a scientist or an astronaut or something grand, and then you became a NEET. A pathetic frogposter NEET. She probably cries herself to sleep everyday thinking about how bad it is and how she wishes she could just disappear. She can’t even try to talk with you because all you say is “I REALLY REALLY LIKE THIS PICTURE.” You’ve become a parody of your own self. And that’s all you are.

915,"Motherboard: Connects all the parts and allows them to communicate with each other directly. It also houses the BIOS and various necessary boot info.

The processor: It does math equations and essentially just processes stuff. It does all the computations of the computer.

The RAM: It is a small amount of storage that can be read and written at super fast speeds. It's basically sonic with a backpack. It's purpose is to hold data that is about to be used. When you load up a program for instance, all the buttons and their icons and stuff are loaded into the ram so they can be loaded onto the screen faster than you can see. If it were all loaded from the harddrive in real time every program would load much much slower.

The Graphics Card: It's basically just a little computer inside your bigger computer that is purposed to compute graphics. It has a processor, ram and motherboard and sometimes even a tiny tiny bit of storage for settings and drivers.

Watercooler vs fan: A fan is a fan. It moves air to help circulate the warm air out and the colder air into your computer. A watercooler is a system of tubing that carries water or other coolant with a pump to the parts of the computer that get quite hot such as the GPU or the CPU. The water/coolant also has a cool off point, usually grates or thin tubing with fans blowing through them to take the heat outside the computer.

Numbers: Google that shit in specific situations. Nobody really knows. CPU model numbers are weird.

Motherboard support: Google that shit in specific situations. It's also probably listed on the box and any website with information about the mobo.

2x gpu: I know very little about this but I believe you need similar or the same card to do more than 1. Similar meaning in the same generation and probably of the same company. 

Increase specs: This is entirely dependent on your computer. Most often the CPU and GPU. GPU does all the graphics stuff so if your computer simply isn't powerful enough to render a game then most likely that. CPU when your graphics card is capable but your CPU isn't.

1023,"Back when I was pretty young, maybe 6 to 9 years old, I was taking swimming lessons that were hosted by the high school in my home town. They were every day of the week except weekends for a few weeks in the summer, and a couple days of the week we'd go to the closest lake and swim at a little public beach there. One day, we were at that beach and I had cut my foot on a rock there and I was taken out of the water for the rest of the time. Over the course of a couple hours I was with the teachers out of the water, this strange looking man came back over and over and tried to get past the teachers who wouldn't let anyone into our little section of the beach that wasn't approved. He came once and left after asking why he couldn't swim there. He came back not long later with, I kid you not, a pair of fake Groucho Marx eyebrows and a big mustache and more forcefully tried to get past. The teachers obviously couldn't use force against him so he walked around them fast but they advised him to leave before the cops were called. The rest of the beach was quite open and there was no obvious reason for him to come to all the little kids. He left quickly but after another short amount of time returned again this time with glasses and no eyebrows. This time he just stood and watched. The teachers clearly watching him so he didn't make a move. He looked at me and smiled, and tried to do a little peekaboo thing with me to look friendly I assume. After this he bolted towards the water and got in very quickly. I was far back with the kids who were sitting out but I remember other teachers running to him. Another one near me pulled out her phone and called the cops I assume, as they showed up not long after. I never saw what the guy did, but here's the kicker; One of my now best friends happened to be at exact same place at the exact same time, taking swimming lessons there. I have told him this story and he mentioned that it was ironic, as he remembered a very similar situation with the same details, except he was in the water and the mysterious guy dove for him and grabbed him. Apparently tried to get out of the water with my friend but dropped him as he ran. Up until when I told my friend the story I hadn't really made the connection that that man was trying to kidnap us or something. Very scary thought to me now and crazy that my friend wasn't just there, he was almost the victim.
