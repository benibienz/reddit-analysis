Gosh where the idea of that nerf even comes from?  What are your thought about this?  This will surely keep me away from pugging anymore with my healer

Edit: Thanks to all of you answering with your feedback. We all know that when they change one skill its for a reason , rigth?  You guys have good ideas about why they are nerfing it and its probably mostly to balance with major mending buff now available trought cleansing ritual and rune focus. Sure it wont change a lot  of thing when doing dungeons with a good group, but it can affect the not so good random group you can fall on when pugging. Thats why my statement about pugging less with my healer. I like to read your thoughts guys because sometime we realise things we havent.
