6,"When I travel I do not have a crazy urge to see the stuff I see in every guide book and every post card.  The best example I can think of is I will probably never go see the leaning tower or Pisa because it isn't near anything else that I would be interested in seeing and very rarely does a tourist attraction like that fulfil anything in me that I couldn't get from seeing a picture of it.  

The most joy I get out of traveling is not having many plans, walking around new places, trying new food and experiencing a new culture.  In most places this leads you to see the majority of those attractions everyone recommends.  But the most memorable experiences come from meeting locals and experiencing a brief moment of what their life is like in that location.

I think your annoyance is that the people who ask questions with phrases like the ones you mention are the same kind of people who want to take the perspective photo with the leaning toward of pisa or a picture of themself with a lion, they ask this question so that they can then post on facebook that they are living like the locals.

85,"Further along I see that she addresses who is requesting a NET.  Employers and students.  She also states that a simple explanation to the students usually get them to understand why it doesn't matter. 

As for the employers, back to my original point.  If it is in an EFL setting, students want a mix of NET/NNET and the employers are specifically looking for NET positions in some cases.  In my experience in Korea it is like 5 to 1 with the former being NNET Korean teachers.  So, it is not fair if they won't employ a NNET from another first language other than Korean assuming they are highly qualified, however, it is a different problem than the NET/NNET one that is presented here.  The real problem is that in Korea they are looking for a NET over all else.  They often hire people with no experience based only only their native language.  That is backwards.  But the fact that students can get benefits from NET means that in some cases employers should be allowed to look specifically for a NET, however, they should also take into account training etc.

When I was very young traveling meant renting a house near a ski resort and snowboarding for a few days.

My first experience really traveling was when I was 12.  My grandmother bought an RV and drove me around the entire US.  I saw almost every site worth seeing and went to all the great amusement parks.  Looking back that was a crazy idea my grandmother had but I'll never forget it.

When I was 15 I went on a school trip to English.  Then 16 a school trip to France.  After that is when I started the ""I must figure out how I can pay for traveling myself,"" voyage that I have been on now for the past 10 years.

Also, go to places where you have friends you can stay with, then the cost of travel is reduced by a ton.

189,"I travel from the west coast to Asia often.  What I do is stay up all night the night before my flight.  Don't sleep.  Should be easy since you want to leave your house a little after 3 AM, just put on a movie with a friend who can easily stay up late and have them help you stay awake.  By the time you get on the flight in Vancouver you will be so tired that sleeping for the majority of the flight will be easy.  When you wake up it'll be Beijing's morning.  By the time you are tired again it will be early evening in Beijing, you shouldn't have an issue with jet lag.",2016-05-12 07:13:07+00:00,d32f51s,1,t3_4izer1,2139,travel
190,"I have had that happen.  My best advice is don't sleep the night before.  Show up super tired and ready to sleep for like 9 hours.  It makes the flight go by much faster, a glass of wine helps.  Bring a computer or a book for the rest of those hours.  Too late for that though and you say you didn't bring enough to fill the time.  Grab an airport book, you can probably finish it.",2016-05-12 06:57:26+00:00,d32eu6a,1,t3_4iyv6l,11334,travel
191,"I took a 100 hour course before getting my first job.  I remember it taking almost no time at all, very easy.  It helped in Korea, if your employer wants you to have it you might as well do it.  Edit:  I see you have experience, i'd still do it.

192,"Ok, good luck.  For more helpful feedback I think talking about your experience with soccer is perfect.  Also, if you have any experience learning languages that will be helpful.  The part about living in Spain for awhile is fine but they really don't care about your travel experiences, if anything it may make them think you are just going to use teaching as a means of traveling like every other person.  Try to put in any relevant language experience you may have instead.",2016-05-11 05:56:04+00:00,d30zty9,3,t1_d30dp8h,35148,TEFL
193,"That is about what my undergrad GPA was.  Like someone else said you won't be considered for Georgetown or Columbia, however, with my low GPA and 5 years of teaching experience I had my choice between two very good programs and got a small scholarship.  Do a good job on your letters and interview. ",2016-05-11 05:39:05+00:00,d30zg0z,1,t3_4irm0z,28613,TEFL
194,I'd imagine this letter will be just fine for a job opening that does not require any experience or certification.  If Japan is anything like Korea they will hire the first person that they like. ,2016-05-10 06:25:19+00:00,d2zmz6j,1,t3_4ilkno,35481,TEFL
