So I will have 16 hours in Chengdu between flights but it is from 5 PM till 10 AM.  Not the best time to do stuff.

So, my question is anyone who has spent time in chengdu what is your recommendation?  An area that's easy to get to from the airport and I can get a good meal and see something interesting.

EDIT BOT told me to say more about myself:  Now I'm 29 American, I have lived abroad and traveled extensively ever since graduating college in 2010.
