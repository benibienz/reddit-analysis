One good example of this is [Apple Magician Girl](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Card_Artworks:Apple_Magician_Girl). Sure the art has been changed, but not nearly as much as it would be in previous years (take Dark Magician Girl's earlier arts as the best example of this).

But, as I said in the post, Freight Car originally had a draw effect that was infinitely abusable with Machine Duplication (won't write the whole effect here, but let's just say you could discard 3 cards to draw 7), so it had to be changed.

And regarding consistency and destruction, I *had* to give them a lot of consistency because their raw power output is lacking, and they had to have field clearing for similar reasons.

In hindsight I may have made a couple of cards too OP, but it's always tricky regarding a brand new idea which hasn't been done before, which in this case is a Rank 1 Turbo archetype. It's a careful balance, and sometimes it goes wrong. I won't be balancing these cards because updating the script is not something I particularly want to do. However, I will take a closer look at the cards I make in the future just to make sure they don't have some really obvious broken interactions.

The archetype I posted here a few days ago was based on using their own Continuous Spells to Summon themselves, then make Rank 7 plays.

But I have gone far more gimmicky than that. For example: I've made an archetype that focuses on placing cards on the bottom of the Deck, then abusing that, and an archetype of slightly anti-meta Fish-Type Pendulum Gemini monsters.

But when I make cards they usually follow no strict pattern. I make whatever feels right to work with the gimmick they're focused on (in the aforementioned case, placing cards on the bottom of the Deck so you can get them later).

I do make sure the boss monsters always feel bossy, and have either some protection or a floating effect so you aren't completely screwed when investing resources into summoning them.",2016-07-03 16:46:57+00:00,d4xsp9x,1,t3_4r29jo,7393,yugioh

I took a slightly different approach, as I left everything untouched and just made 2 new cards that would hopefully help.

**Elemental HERO Masked Neos** (LV7/LIGHT/ATK: 2500/DEF: 2000)

[Warrior/Effect]

*You can Special Summon this card (from your hand) by sending 1 ""Neo-Spacian"" monster from your hand or Deck to the Graveyard. This card's name becomes ""Elemental HERO Neos"" while it is face-up on the field or in the Graveyard. When this card leaves the field: You can add 1 ""Neo Space"" card from your Deck to your hand.*

I'm bad with names

Anyways, the idea behind this is that it's an easily summonable Neos substitute that also searches Neo Space or Instant Neo Space as you will probably need those cards so that whatever you summoned doesn't go away instantly.

---

**Neo Space Barrier** (Spell Card/Continuous)

*All Fusion Monsters you control that list ""Elemental HERO Neos"" as a Fusion Material are unaffected by your opponent's card effects. Once per turn, when an ""Elemental HERO"" Fusion Monster that lists ""Elemental HERO Neos"" as a Fusion Material is shuffled into the Extra Deck: You can Special Summon 1 ""Elemental HERO Neos"" from your hand, Deck or Graveyard.*

This is supposed to give the Deck some recovery, by retrieving the most annoying monster to get, while having some protection for the Fusions you summoned, so if by some miracle they do manage to stay on the field, they don't just get blown up instantly.

Again, these are supposed to work in tandem with existing cards, and not really replace anything, nor would they make Neo-Spacians meta (nothing can really do that though). Any thoughts would be appreciated.",2016-06-21 10:48:54+00:00,d4htnot,1,t3_4p3qxg,5105,yugioh

Keep Twin Twisters - I prefer them over MST or any of its alternatives, because it triggers the effects of all the Super Quantums, as well as allowing you to pop 2 backrow. It also allows you to get rid of possibly dead Brilliant Fusions or Garnets, a situation which does happen.

Super Quantum Mech Sword - Magnaslayer - I don't know why you need this. I mean, it's alright but there's much better cards you could be running here.

3x - Jizukiru, the Star-Destroying Kaiju - probably the best Kaiju out there

3x - Dogoran, the Mad Flame Kaiju - pretty sweet beater, and the effect is alright if you ever bother using it

3x - Gamecial, the Sea Turtle Kaiju - nice monster to give to your opponent, but it also has a fantastic negation effect if you get it

2x - Thunder King, the Lightningstrike Kaiju - OTK enabler and what not, but ultimately a bit situational to run at 3

2x - Gadarla, the Mystery Dust Kaiju - I guess the effect's alright, but it's mostly at 2 so I have something to give my opponent if I like my Gameciels too much

2x - Radian, the Multidimensional Kaiju - Your field's going to be mostly empty with Kaijus, so he helps. A lot.

2x - Kumongous, the Sticky String Kaiju - Probably the weakest of the bunch, pretty much run him to give my opponent something mostly useless

1x - Neo-Spacian Grand Mole - Because getting your Kaijus back is fucking hilarious

1x - Silent Wobby - For the lols mostly, but the LP boost is quite nice, and I found the card you give your opponent to not be too important in the long run

---

3x - Kyoutou Waterfront - Insane Field Spell. Why would you not run 3?

3x - Interrupted Kaiju Slumber - Dark Hole on drugs.

2x - Terraforming - For consistency, though I sometimes draw it without any targets. 2 is probably still optimal though.

2x - Summoning Curse - Similar reasons to Grand Mole - Tributing your opponent's monster to give them a Kaiju, only to make them minus is pretty great. Hurts you, but Waterfront can get over it.

1x - Raigeki - No explanation needed here

1x - Trade-In - Found it to be better than Magic Planter personally, since the deck does like LV8s

1x - Upstart Goblin - Not entirely sure why, though draw cards are always nice.

---

3x - Kaiju Capture Mission - Draw power up the arse, and decent Counter storage (also enables some fun combos allowing you to circumvent once per turn clauses)

2x - Remove Brainwashing - Even if you already have a Kaiju out this is alright, because the one on your opponent's field just comes to you and blows up. Doesn't really hurt you, but hurts your opponent. Also Magic Planter target for when I actually ran it.

1x - Skill Drain - This replaced Soul Drain pretty recently. Allows you to go for Rank 8/9 or even Rank 10 plays. I don't run an Extra Deck (at the moment) but this is still a good card to have.

1x of each: Solemn Strike / Solemn Warning - Could probably run more Strikes, but I haven't found it necessary as of yet

Since CotH and Fiendish Chain can easily wind up dead after Xyz plays, and Sacred Tree can be useless when you have a well established field or multiple copies of it, Magic Planter is a nice bit of draw power. Might need a few more Continuous Traps to make it work really, could be an interesting card to side a second copy of maybe.

374,"Good idea. I also thought about culture after they showed the new culture map and came up with a system for (possibly) better cultural acceptance while falling asleep once, where countries would accept cultures as accepted by default after a certain amount of years have passed. I always thought this made sense, as cultures that have been part of your country for many years will generally grow accustomed to this rule, although there are obvious exceptions to this.

The amount of time would depend on:

* Development: each development point a province of that culture has would contribute 0.05% towards acceptance each year. When this percentage reaches a 100%, the culture would be accepted. For example, the three Sami provinces have a total of 9 development, so it would take a country about 222 years to accept them.

* Accepted Culture Threshold would get another use by increasing the percentage you get yearly towards cultural acceptance of a certain culture. So, if you took Humanist ideas, it's only take you about 148 years to accept Sami, as opposed to 222 previously (because it'd technically count the provinces as having 50% more development due to the modifier).

* There are a few other factors that could increase it (such as being in the same culture group) but these are the main ones I came up with.

As a result of these changes, culture conversion could probably be made a bit more expensive. The more provinces a culture has, the harder it will be to convert it (again, I think this makes sense from both a historical and gameplay standpoint, as you wouldn't go converting cultures that'll be accepted within 50 years). What may also probably be nerfed is the Accepted Culture Threshold modifier because of the additional function it serves. Either that, or assign the percentage growth to an entirely different modifier.

I'll work on this idea some more, but I personally think it makes sense (then again I did come up with it when I was almost asleep so it may be really stupid).",2016-01-30 14:50:08+00:00,czhkesr,1,t3_43e5ul,3044,eu4

* some modifiers are missing (such as Yearly Papal Influence iirc, these are rare though)
* ideas cannot repeat (take Muscovy as the prime example of this in the game, with their ridiculous manpower)
* cannot have multiple modifiers on one idea (this is seen all over the game)
* for some reason the hostile core-creation cost modifier increases by +15% which makes no god damn sense

I do think it's better to just play a historical nation, which is also the reason I don't really play with the RNW. Both the nation designer and the random new world are great features (especially as RNW got a revamp with 1.14.), but at the end of the day they just feel a bit gimmicky.

Overall, I think El Dorado is worth its sale price purely on the basis of the automatic exploration (which I despise but is a nice QoL improvement) and the hunt for the seven cities, and all its related events, which give colonizing a real fun feel that it was missing previously.

And the reason I think you're being downvoted is because of the implication that this needs to, or that it even can be fixed. The lack of women in the community *isn't* a problem. And even if it was, there's no good way to fix it without forcing women to be part of the community, which is stupid.

If more women wanted to be part of community, they would be. There is *nothing* stopping them.

Less stupid modifiers, which is nice. Alternatively:

&gt; There is now a -100 opinion modifier for having force vassalized or enforced a union upon a subject

May change playstyles a bit

*yes*

&gt; Integrating Lithuania via decision no longer possible if they have grown by over 10 provinces since 1444

&gt; Bukhara no longer releases Sibir when forming

I guess this was annoying, but with Uzbek having cores on all their land and not releasing Sibir, this is a big buff for them.

&gt; Ragusa now starts guaranteed by the Ottomans

Interesting

&gt; All crusader states now start with Western tech, instead of just The Knights

My Naxos dreams are finally coming true

&gt; Uzbeks now start with cores on all of their provinces in 1444

Uzbek OP plz nerf

&gt; Changing tags should no longer set all countries' attitudes towards you to Neutral

heh

-10% regiment cost gives them cheap regiments, which is always nice, and it also makes the cavalry *really* cheap to build.

+5% discipline is good and their final idea gives them +15% morale of armies, which is fantastic considering it's only bettered by France and Prussia.

I was one of the few major people in Europe who didn't join a league because frankly I tried my best to avoid Europe. So, because of everyone in the HRE having mutual hatred for each other, I was elected the Holy Roman Emperor because I was the person they *hated the least*.

Shortly after, the league war fired, and I had to defend the HRE after not caring about Europe for the past 150 years. France and Spain were on my side, while Austria and England joined the Protestants (it was a weird game). Spain and France could pretty much hold off all of the Catholic league by themselves, but the war lasted for a good 15 years and everyone was out of manpower and willpower by the end.

I may have a look at updating the track, but really the only change would be the pitlane entry so it allows for more runoff, T1 and (less likely) making T4 tighter.
