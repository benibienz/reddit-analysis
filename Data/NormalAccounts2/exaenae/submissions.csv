So I'll talk about the various things that happened through the day.

#**The pulls**

Holos:

*1x SPYRAL Super Agent*

*2x Triamid Sphinx*

*1x Magician's Rod*

*1x Metamorformation*

Safe to say I wasn't too pleased about my pulls. Only 1 Ultra Rare and no Secrets, and the Supers I got weren't too excellent. But overall not horrible.

Rares:

*1x SPYRAL GEAR Drone*

*1x SPYRAL GEAR Big Red*

*1x SPYRAL Quik-Fix*

*1x Illusion Magic*

*1x Acrobatic Magician*

The rares were okay. More Dark Magician support which was entirely pointless because this was a sneak peek. I got 1 of every single SPYRAL card though, and that comes into play.

---

#**Decklist**

Now obviously this won't mean much, since it is a sneak peek and not a particularly valid deck on its own, but I'll post it anyway.

* 3x Performapal Bubblebowwow

* 2x Performapal Inflater Tapir

* 1x Performapal Radish Horse

The Pals. I was actually quite satisfied with the ratios here. Bubblebowwow (which I actually pulled 4 of) served as a high scale and occasional beater, Inflater Tapir was excellent at extending the game until I draw into better cards, and Radish Horse was decent to decrease other monster's ATK, since big beaters weren't that prevalent.

* 2x - Blackwing - Gofu the Vague Shadow

* 2x - Dragodies, the Empowered Warrior

I was so pleased I pulled Gofu, as it served as a very good wall until I could draw into more cards. Dragodies was one of the MVPs, as it served as an excellent low scale, and with plenty of dead cards in hand due to the nature of the event, its effect got plenty of usage.

* 2x Metalfoes Silvird

* 1x Metalfoes Counter

The saddest Metalfoes engine in existence. Silvird served as an occasional beater and a good low scale, and Counter mostly saw play to get the second Silvird out of the deck, more than actually being a Metalfoe search target.

* 1x SPYRAL Super Agent

* 1x SPYRAL Quik-Fix

* 1x SPYRAL GEAR Drone

* 1x SPYRAL GEAR Big Red

The bread and butter of this build, these dudes saved me so many games. Using Drone's effect to make your opponent's topdecks bad, then Summoning Super Agent to pop a S/T then turn him into a beater. Just great.

* 1x Paleozoic Hallucigenia

* 1x Paleozoic Pikaia

Another sad engine. Most of the time I was hoping to draw into Pikaia first, discard Hallucigenia and draw 2, but in the end Hallucigenia just ended up being mostly used as Shrink.

* 1x Magical Something

Because I ran out of cards to put in.

#**Mini report**

My memory's not that great so I'll keep these short

**Round 1:**

My round 1 opponent was someone who just took the packs and left. Oh well, free win and 40 minutes of snooping around the tables to see what everyone else is playing.

**1-0**

**Round 2**

I actually got to play this time.

*Game 1*

I won easily because he didn't draw anything of any use. Most notable moment was when I used Radish Horse to increase the ATK of a Burges- Paleozoic (ugh) card and decrease the ATK of his monster so I could run it over, only for me to realize next turn that it's unaffected by monster effects and I rammed it into a stronger monster.

*Game 2*

This one was much more interesting. He never looked like winning, but he had an infinitely respawning wall of 3 Ankylos that I couldn't get around. It took me until I drew Super Agent, summoned him and popped one of his scales when I could really start pushing for game.

**2-0**

**Round 3**

*Game 1*

Dude pulled a shitload of Paleozoics, including the Xyz, so I stood very little chance as he just had removal options galore. He also played with Wrecker Panda which was funny.

*Game 2*

Similar to game 1. He summoned Anomalocaris, I could do very little about it.

**2-1**

**Round 4**

Last round (I wasn't in the top 4).

*Game 1*

This game had one of my most clutch victories ever. He kept stalling with Performapal Gumgumouton and a few other cards, and I was just waiting on Super Agent to make my plays. However, he was *the last card* in my deck, so I had to beat him *that turn*.

He had Bubblebowwow in attack, so that was my target. I summoned Drone, then summoned Super Agent, popped a scale (slight misplay), then tributed Drone, giving Super Agent a 3000 boost. **Then** I used Big Red to revive Drone, tribute it again, and get Super Agent up to 7900 ATK. It was glorious. Finally I used Hallucigenia to halve Bubblebowwow's ATK, and pushed for game.

One of my finest moments.

*Game 2*

Much more straightforward. I kept killing his things with Dragodies in the scale and placing beaters on the field until his LP hit 0.

**3-1**

---

#**Post tourney rewards**

The short story is: we opened up a bunch of packs (a total of 36ish), among which were OTS Pack 1 and 2 and TDIL. Then we placed all cards on the table (except the commons which were kept in a pile), then we went in the order we placed in the tournament and picked our cards out. I got:

2x Paleozoic Anomalocaris - really happy I got these, I want to build Burgers, if at least for fun

1x Anti-Spell Fragrance - would've loved to get more of these, but even one is nice

1x Super Quantum Blue Layer - don't actually need this but I love the art and it looks good in Super

1x Performapal Lizardraw - we were running out of things to take so I took this one for my friend who plays Dracopals

1x Triamid Master - really running out of things to take now

1x Michael, the Arch-Lightsworn - I already have 2 Ultras but I like the card anyway

1x Flying ""C"" - may as well

8x random commons

Finally, at the end of all this I traded all my Metalfoes (2 Silvird, 1 Counter and an Orichalc I got later on) as well as 1 Dark Contract card for this dude's Paleozoics, just so I have as many of them as possible, as I'd like to build them even if it is just for casual play.

Also a playmat was given away to 1st place, but there was also one given away at random. Unfortunately though, I didn't get it. Maybe some other time.

That's it, and that's very long. Nevertheless, I hope you enjoyed reading this.",yugioh,"My first sneak peek - a short report, pull list and more",https://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/4vdg3e/my_first_sneak_peek_a_short_report_pull_list_and/
1,2016-07-28 13:46:45+00:00,self.yugioh,https://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/4v0ruu/exas_custom_cards_iii_toy_trains_rank_1_trains/,False,"#Introduction

The last archetype that I made was absolutely massive, clocking in at 20 cards. This time I've toned it down a bit, and made a relatively small archetype consisting of 9 cards.

The cards are all based on existing Train cards, which we all know and love. Initialy the Toy Train effects were supposed to be similar to their Train counterparts, but this just made the two archetypes too similar, so I messed around with the effects a bit.

Without further ado, let's get into the cards. As always, all links are at the bottom if you want to skip all this reading.

---

**Toy Train Switchyard**

Spell Card / Field

*You can discard 1 card; add 1 Level 1 EARTH Machine-Type monster from your Deck to your hand. You can only use this effect of ""Toy Train Switchyard"" once per turn. If this card in the Field Zone is destroyed by a card effect: Add 1 ""Toy Train"" card from your Deck to your hand.*

Starting off with the Field Spell. This card is a bit less important to this deck than Revolving Switchyard is to Trains, but it definitely doesn't hurt to have it. During your turn, you can discard a card and fetch yourself any Toy Train you want from the Deck, and when it's destroyed, it performs an additional search, this time for *any* Toy Train card, Kozmotown-style, which means it can also search their Spells, including itself.

---

**Toy Train Express**

★

**EARTH**/Machine/Effect

*If this card is Normal Summoned: You can add 1 ""Toy Train"" monster from your Deck to your hand. All Level 1 monsters you control gain 800 ATK.*

A simple searcher, what more do you need. You can use it to search a card I will mention later that will allow you to instantly make a Rank 1 play, or you can search for any other Toy Train you need. On top of that, it provides your small monsters with a small boost.

ATK: 200 / DEF: 1000

---

**Toy Train Railcar**

★

**EARTH**/Machine/Effect

*If this card is Normal Summoned: You can add 1 ""Toy Train Switchyard"" from your Deck or Graveyard to your hand. You can inflict 500 damage to your opponent. You can only use this effect of ""Toy Train Railcar"" once per turn.*

ATK: 500 / DEF: 1800

Now, in case you didn't notice, Express doesn't search Spells, but that's what we have this guy for. Railcar is one of a few one card Xyz plays you can make in this Deck, just by allowing you to get the Field Spell (again, I'll get onto the monsters that allow these plays that in a moment). Much like Ruffian Railcar, he also allows you to burn your opponent for 500, however this little guy actually allows you to have a Battle Phase if you do, unlike his bigger counterpart.

---

**Toy Train Locomotive**

★

**EARTH**/Machine/Effect

*If you control a Level 1 EARTH Machine-Type monster, you can Special Summon this card (from your hand). If this card is detached from an Xyz Monster and sent to the Graveyard to activate that monster's effect: You can target 1 card your opponent controls; destroy it.*

ATK: 100 / DEF: 2000

Here is the monster I've been mentioning for a bit now. Locomotive can be Special Summoned from your hand if you control *any* Level 1 EARTH Machine-Type monster, not just Toy Trains, so it's a bit more splashable in that regard. This means you can, for example, summon Railcar, search the Field Spell, search this dude, and you have yourself a neat little Rank 1. Finally, it has Derricrane's effect, allowing you to pop a card when it's detached from an Xyz Monster.

---

**Toy Train Turbojet**

★

**EARTH**/Machine/Effect

*If this card is in your hand: You can target 1 Field Spell Card you control; destroy it, and if you do, Special Summon this card. If Summoned this way: You can target 1 monster your opponent controls; banish it.*

ATK: 500 / DEF: 500

Another easy Xyz Summon, you can use this guy to pop your own Switchyard, get rid of a pesky monster your opponent controls, *and* get a search off Switchyard all in one swift move.

---

**Toy Train Freight Car**

★

**EARTH**/Machine/Effect

*If this card is detached from an Xyz Monster and sent to the Graveyard to activate that monster's effect: You can Special Summon 1 ""Toy Train Freight Car"" from your hand or Deck.*

ATK: 0 / DEF: 0

This card originally had a completely different effect, allowing for draw power, before I realized it could be completely abused with Machine Duplication. Anyways, its new effect is nothing to scoff at - when it's detached from an Xyz Monster, it Special Summons another copy of itself to the field, allowing you to build up your defenses or make more Xyz plays.

---

**Toy Train Rail Cannon Model 0047**

☆

**EARTH**/Machine/Xyz/Effect

*2 Level 1 Machine-Type monsters*

*You can detach 1 Xyz Material from this card, then target 1 card your opponent controls; destroy it, and if you do, inflict 1500 damage to your opponent. You can only use this effect of ""Toy Train Rail Cannon Model 0047"" once per turn.*

ATK: 1500 / DEF: 2000

Here is Gustav's little brother. Now, the main problem with Rank 1 monsters is that they are inherently weak. Gustav Max has a whooping 3000 ATK, so his burn damage effect is the cherry on top. However, this guy is a bit weaker, so I gave him a pseudo-Volcasaurus effect - by detaching 1 Xyz Material, you can destroy any card on the field *and* burn your opponent for 1500. Combine this card with Locomotive and you've just cleared two cards!

---

**Toy Train Rail Cannon Model 0081**

☆

**EARTH**/Machine/Xyz/Effect

*2 Level 1 Machine-Type monsters*

*Once per turn, during either player's turn: You can detach 1 Xyz Material from this card, then target 1 Machine-Type monster you control; this turn, it is unaffected by other card effects, except its own. If this card is sent to the Graveyard: You can target 1 Level 1 ""Toy Train"" monster in your Graveyard; Special Summon it, and if you do, you can destroy 1 card your opponent controls.*

ATK: 600 / DEF: 2400

Toy Dora's effect is quite similar to the real thing, apart from a few minor differences. It only allows you to target your own monsters, which you mostly want to do anyways, and it can only target Machine-Types, which isn't that big of a deal. However, unlike Dora, this card also floats, Special Summoning any Toy Train (apart from the Xyz ones) from your Graveyard upon being sent to the Graveyard, and when the Train arrives, you can destroy a card on the field.

---

**Toy Train Station**

Spell/Quick-Play

*Target 1 Machine-Type monster in your Graveyard with 500 or less ATK; Special Summon it in face-up Defense Position. If you control no monsters: You can banish this card from your Graveyard, then target 1 ""Toy Train"" monster in your Graveyard; Special Summon it.*

Arriving at our final station (heh), we have Toy Train Station, a card which gives you two opportunities to recover your monsters. Using its on-field effect, you can revive any weak Machine from your Graveyard (which means you can also splash this card into Deskbots, if you're mad enough), and its second effect allows you to banish it and Special Summon any Toy Train from the Graveyard, as long as you have an empty field.

---

That's all from me now, feel free to leave any comments down below, and also report any possible bugs with the scripts.

---

**EDIT:** The two scripts have been updated. I did some further testing and noticed that 0081 could Special Summon itself, which was not intended. This has now been updated.",yugioh,Exa's Custom Cards III: Toy Trains - RANK 1 TRAINS (with YGOPro script),https://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/4v0ruu/exas_custom_cards_iii_toy_trains_rank_1_trains/
2,2016-07-14 21:13:32+00:00,self.yugioh,https://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/4svnmb/exas_custom_cards_ii_tenebrous_fusing_zombies/,False,"#Introduction

Exactly two weeks ago I posted my first custom archetype on here called [Ildyr](https://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/4qlcyp/exas_custom_cards_i_ildyr_with_ygopro_script/). I got OK reception, so I figured I'd continue since I have a lot of cards saved up.

So here's part 2: Tenebrous. I initially made these guys when I was sort of uninspired, which lead to an uninspired archetype, but when I started scripting it I revisited them and revamped the effects.

Their focus is on Fusion Summoning, with a slight focus on Synchro Summoning and banishing cards.

Just like last time, all relevant links are at the **bottom** of the post.

---

Last time, I posted a small-ish archetype consisting of 13 cards. This time I've made it **20**. Due to this increase in cards I won't feature all of them here, as that would create a massive post. Rather, I'm going to outline a few important cards, then link a Google Docs link at the bottom for those who want to read the entire thing (or you could skip that step and just download the YGOPro script)

#Main Deck Monsters

**Tenebrous Spectral Skeleton**

★★★

**DARK**/Zombie/Effect

*When this card is Normal or Special Summoned: You can add 1 ""Tenebrous"" monster from your Deck to your hand. If this card is sent to the Graveyard as a Fusion Material for a Fusion Summon: You can activate this effect; this turn, Fusion Monsters you control cannot be destroyed by battle or card effects.*
ATK: 1300 / DEF: 0

Now, Skeleton is the main searcher of the deck. Upon any Summon, he can search out any Tenebrous monster, which will allow you to fetch anything you may want for a Fusion Summon, or a Tuner you want to Synchro Summon with.

---

**Tenebrous Grim Ghost**

★★★

**DARK**/Zombie/Effect

*When this card is Normal Summoned: You can add 1 ""Tenebrous"" Spell/Trap Card from your Deck to your hand. During either player's turn, when a card or effect is activated that targets a Fusion Monster you control (except during the Damage Step): You can banish this card from your Graveyard; negate that effect.*

ATK: 1100 / DEF: 0

Another searcher, this time for Spells and Traps, and it only triggers on Normal Summon. There aren't many Spells and Traps in the archetype, but you will want them in your hand.

---

**Tenebrous Mist Mage**

★★★

**DARK**/Zombie/Effect

*When this card is Normal or Special Summoned: You can send 1 ""Tenebrous"" Spell/Trap Card from your Deck to the Graveyard; draw 1 card. You can only use this effect of ""Tenebrous Mist Mage"" once per turn. If this card is sent to the Graveyard as a Fusion Material for a Fusion Summon: You can target 1 Spell/Trap Card on the field; destroy it.*

ATK: 1600 / DEF: 0

Two out of three Spells/Traps in the archetype have an effect when they're sent to the Graveyard, and the last one can return itself from the Graveyard, so the Spell/Trap dump is a bonus to the already nice draw on Summon. And, when used for a Fusion Summon, you can destroy a Spell/Trap Card on the field so your monsters can breathe freely (unless, y'know, it's a Strike but what can you do).

---

**Tenebrous Sempiternal Spirit**

★★

**DARK**/Zombie/Tuner/Effect

*If you control no monsters, you can Special Summon this card (from your hand). When this card is Normal or Special Summoned: You can target 1 of your banished Level 4 or lower Zombie-Type monsters; Special Summon it. Cannot be used as a Synchro Material, except for the Synchro Summon of a Zombie-Type monster. If this card is sent to the Graveyard as a Synchro Material: You can target 1 ""Tenebrous"" card in your Graveyard, except ""Tenebrous Sempiternal Spirit""; add that target to your hand.*

ATK: 0 / DEF: 0

Our main Tuner, which can be Special Summoned any time whilst you have an empty field, and on Summon can Special Summon 1 of your banished Level 4 or lower Zombies. To prevent this from being thoroughly abused, it can only be used for Zombie Synchros. And when it's used for a Synchro Summon, it fetches a Tenebrous card back from the Graveyard, so you always have the resources you need.

---

**Tenebrous Stygian Sorcerer**

★★★★

**DARK**/Zombie/Effect

*During either player's turn: You can Tribute this card; Special Summon 1 ""Tenebrous"" monster from your hand or Deck, except ""Tenebrous Stygian Sorcerer"". If this card is sent to the Graveyard as a Fusion Material for a Fusion Summon: Draw 1 card. You can only use this effect of ""Tenebrous Stygian Sorcerer"" once per turn.*

ATK: 1700 / DEF: 0

The last Main Deck monster I'm going to show here (go read the document, there's way more there). You can Tribute it at any time, Kozmo pilot style, to Special Summon any Tenebrous monster from your hand or Deck, except another copy of itself. Also, when it's used for a Fusion Summon, you get to draw a card so you don't go into too much of a minus.

---

#Extra Deck Monsters

**Tenebrous Shadow Serpent**

★★★★★

**DARK**/Zombie/Synchro/Effect

*1 DARK Tuner + 1 or more non-Tuner monsters*

*Cannot be destroyed by battle. Once per turn, when this face-up card is targeted by an opponent's card effect: You can target 1 card on the field; destroy that target. If this card is in your Graveyard: You can banish 1 other Zombie-Type monster from your Graveyard; shuffle this card into the Extra Deck.*

ATK: 2050 / DEF: 0

One of the more interesting cards I came up while making this archetype. Initially all Extra Deck monsters had battle protection, but I decided that was stupid and reduced it to a select few.

Each time this bad boy is targeted, you get to pop a card on the field. Might not prove too useful in the long run, as non-targeting destruction is ever present, but it can serve as an annoyance anyways.

---

**Tenebrous Diabolic Doll**

★★

**DARK**/Zombie/Fusion/Tuner/Effect

*1 ""Tenebrous"" monster + 1 DARK monster*

*Must first be Fusion Summoned with the above Fusion Material Monsters. Cannot be destroyed by battle. If this card is sent to the Graveyard as a Synchro Material: Draw 1 card. You can only use this effect of ""Tenebrous Diabolic Doll"" once per turn.*

ATK: 1400 / DEF: 0

Another interesting idea I had was to make a Fusion Tuner. So I did. This can help you make Synchro plays if you don't have a Tuner in hand, and you get to draw a card when you Synchro Summon with it.

You can't Summon it with Instant Fusion though, so don't even think about it.

---

**Tenebrous Arcane Artist**

★★★★★★★

**DARK**/Zombie/Fusion/Effect

*1 ""Tenebrous"" monster + 1 DARK monster*

*Once per turn, when a card or effect is activated that targets a card(s) in the Graveyard: You can banish 1 card from either player's Graveyard. If this card is sent to the Graveyard: You can target 1 Level 4 or lower Zombie-Type monster in your Graveyard; Special Summon that target. You can only use this effect of ""Tenebrous Arcane Artist"" once per turn.*

ATK: 2550 / DEF: 0

Onto the standard Fusions, Arcane Artist allows you to banish a card from either Graveyard when a card in the Graveyard is targeted, allowing you to endlessly annoy players that like using their Graveyard. And when it's sent to the Graveyard, you can Special Summon a Level 4 or lower Zombie from your Graveyard.

---

**Tenebrous Eternity**

★★★★★★★★★★

**DARK**/Zombie/Fusion/Effect

*1 ""Tenebrous"" Synchro or Fusion Monster + 2 ""Tenebrous"" monsters*

*Must be Fusion Summoned with the above Fusion Materials and cannot be Special Summoned by other ways. Cannot be targeted by an opponent's card effects. During either player's turn: You can target 1 card in either Graveyard; banish it, and if you do, shuffle 1 card from your opponent's hand (at random) or their side of the field into the Deck. If this card is sent from the field to the Graveyard: You can Special Summon 1 ""Tenebrous"" monster from your Extra Deck, except ""Tenebrous Eternity"", ignoring its Summoning conditions. You can only use each effect of ""Tenebrous Eternity"" once per turn.*

ATK: 3600 / DEF: 0

The big bad boss. First of all, it requires 3 materials to Summon, and its effect has been toned down from its original effect, because that was too powerful even for 3 Fusion Materials.

Anyways, this massive Zombie is untargetable by card effects (couldn't resist), and allows you to essentially shuffle 1 card from your opponent's hand or field into the Deck once per turn, as long as you have cards to banish.

**NOTE:** I'm considering toning this guy down. I haven't had time to fully playtest this deck, so I don't know if this guy's OP. Leave suggestions in comments

---

#Spells/Traps

**Tenebrous Fusion**

Spell Card / Normal

*Fusion Summon 1 Zombie-Type Fusion Monster from your Extra Deck, using monsters from your hand or your side of the field as Fusion Materials. If this card is in your Graveyard: You can banish 1 Zombie-Type monster from your Graveyard; add this card to your hand.*

The main card of the Deck. It essentially does the same thing as Polymerization, but it allows you to banish a Zombie from the Graveyard to return it back to your hand, to make more Fusion plays!

---

**Tenebrous Corrupted Core**

Trap Card / Continuous

*Special Summon this card as a Normal Monster (Zombie-Type/Tuner/DARK/Level 2/ATK 0/DEF 1900). (This card is also still a Trap Card.) If this card is sent to the Graveyard: You can target 1 ""Tenebrous"" monster you control; this turn, it is unaffected by other card effects, except its own.*

A Level 2 Trap Tuner, if you ever need one, which also protects your Tenebrous monsters when sent to the Graveyard (in any way, so even using it for a Synchro Summon will get the effect off).

---

#Links and stuff

Phew, that's it. Except it's not. As I said, there's a total of 20 cards in the archetype, and I've only posted 11 here.

EDIT: Oh yeah, don't forget to backup your cards.cdb file, since you can't play multiplayer with custom cards (unless you both are playing with them). Name it something like cards_backup.cdb and just switch between it and this one whenever you want.

---

Anyways, any and all feedback is appreciated, as well as any possible bug reports if I fucked up one of the scripts. I have a feeling this archetype might be a bit too strong, but then again I might be completely off-base, so comments are appreciated.",yugioh,Exa's Custom Cards II: Tenebrous - Fusing Zombies (with YGOPro script),https://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/4svnmb/exas_custom_cards_ii_tenebrous_fusing_zombies/
3,2016-06-30 12:21:19+00:00,self.yugioh,https://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/4qlcyp/exas_custom_cards_i_ildyr_with_ygopro_script/,False,"#Introduction

I wanted to start posting my custom cards here, since I have way too many already made in Magic Set Editor.

However, I don't have artworks for my cards, because I always have an idea of what the cards want to look like, so I don't just want to take something I found on the internet.

This is why I thought I'd do something extra. On the subreddit I'd post written cards, but for the people who might not want to spend a long time reading, I'd make a YGOPro script, so you can actually try them out against the AI (or actual people, if you can get them to use the script too).

I plan to make these as often as I can, but scripting in lua is a bit of a bitch.

---

And here is my first complete archetype: Ildyr. The idea for these came because I wanted there to be an archetype that focuses on Summoning every rank of Xyz in the game (well, every reasonable one). Burgesstoma go for Rank 2, BA/PK go for Rank 3, absolutely everything Summons Rank 4, Artifacts focus on Rank 5, etc.

The only Ranks I didn't really see represented that well are 1 and 7. Sure, you can make decks that can make those, but I wanted something with a bit more focus, so I made Ildyr, who would hopefully focus on Summoning Rank 7 monsters. The name Ildyr comes from two Norwegian words: ""Ild"", which translates to ""fire"", and ""dyr"", which translates to ""animal"" (if the translation here is wrong, blame Google Translate, I did my best here), and all monsters are named after Greek mythological creatures.

The archetype is composed of two parts: the Ildyr monsters, all Level 7, that make use of their specific sub-archetype of Continuous Spell Cards, Ildyrune, to Special Summon themselves from the hand.

So after typing this much already, let's finally get into it (YGOPro package is at the bottom if you can't be bothered to read).

---

#Effect Monsters

**Ildyr Myrmidon**

★★★★★★★

#YGOPro Script

**You can download it by clicking [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BywA-XUcDol0LUU3Q3g0dmdsMjA/view?pref=2&amp;pli=1).**

You install it by just unzipping it, then copying the contents of the folder to the YGOPro folder. Make sure you backup your cards.cdb database file though, since this will overwrite it. The folder also includes some placeholder images, so you don't have to stare at nothing the entire time.

Also make sure you message me if you find that one of the cards isn't working or there's some sort of bug. As I said, lua is a bit bitchy, so a few things might have slipped.

Would there be any sort of interest in a weekly (or however often I can find time) series where I post some custom cards I've made. I have tens upon hundreds of cards in Magic Set Editor, and while I'm content just keeping them there because I've made them for my personal enjoyment, I was wondering if anyone else would like to see them.

I've got several archetypes made, as well a lot of just generic cards, and if nothing else, I'd like to see if people think they're overpowered or just horrible.

Also I was thinking on making a YGOPro script for each set of cards I would post, and I have currently managed to make two cards, but YGOPro scripting is such a pain I don't know if I'd manage to make many more.

Also, additional note: None of these have images, because I don't like using generic image search results in cards, so I leave them blank. This means there would be a lot of reading.

Anyways, thoughts?

I ordered a Japanese Templar and everything else was fairly cheap. Running the standard 4-5-6 Igknight setup with a decent amount of Xyz monsters here, and I may build on it later (currently liking the Fusion-focused build) when I find more money.

So now that I bought the cards, I went through my card collection, and found some cards that I'm considering splashing in, and I'd just like to get some opinions in (keep in mind this is mostly casual stuff).

---

1) **Freed the Matchless General** - the one I'm pretty sure I'm not going to put in, but put it here for the sake of completion. It's easy to get out and has decent search abilities, but I can't help but feel it's unnecessary.

2) **The Warrior Returning Alive** - another one I'm iffy on, but I'm considering it since I prefer to search Igknights from the Deck with their searches, instead of from the Graveyard, so it might be a decent way to get a scale, but I'm torn on it.

Onto the slightly more interesting stuff:

3) **Heat Wave** - disables pretty much every meta deck. Hurts me a bit too, but I can get a decent field established with its effect active, while my opponents are left powerless. Slightly considering it.

4) **Powersink Stone** - I got this from STBL a long time ago. I'm too cheap to buy Skill Drain so I'm considering running this instead.

5) **Tyrant's Tirade** - See Powersink Stone. Needs 2 Tributes which is easy enough to get, and shuts down a lot of monsters. Also I don't have money for Tyrant's Throes, so this will have to do.

6) **Chain Whirlwind** - I didn't even know I had this one until a couple of days ago. Igknights like to blow themselves up, so I consider this decent S/T removal, but I still prefer MST for obvious reasons.

Fast forward 40 or so years, and I have barely expanded. This was in part because of my weakness, my incompetence, France's unwillingness to help, and that fucking 13-year regency council.

So, my Queen is finally of age, and I start thinking of attacking Castile, upon which the Iberian Wedding fires. ""Well that plan went to shit"" - I think to myself and focus on colonizing the Carribean instead. In the meantime I get an alliance with Portugal to secure myself if Castile decides to attack me.

And then Castile decided to attack me. ""This probably won't be too bad"" - I think and immediately come to realize that's not true. France, Portugal and myself had plenty of soldiers to take Castile and Aragon on (Naples broke free at one point), but there was one tiny problem: Austria was in this war. This caused France to almost completely focus on Austria, and left me and Portugal to be destroyed by Castile and Aragon.

And now we come to the point of this rant: how in the hell are distant wars calculated? Because I remember not being able to call France to war against Portugal (which ended up not happening because I'm weak) because of the distant war modifier, and that's one military access away. But Castile, in an offensive war no less, manages to call Austria into a war that's happening *half a continent away* without any problems (I realize half a continent is an exaggeration but it's still a large distance).

Now I don't really have an issue with the Distant War modifier, except for the fact that it's so fucking inconsistent.

There's also three entire events and I've changed a few things around and buffed Naples' ideas (as if they needed a buff, they're too OP anyways).

Now I'd like suggestions on which countries to cover next, either by giving them unique ideas, or suggestions on flavor events. Finally, suggestions on the balance of all the ideas would be appreciated. I'll also post this on the Paradox forums within the next few days.

Thanks for any suggestions.

Now I've updated it with 5 new idea sets and a couple of flavor events, so I'm posting again.

I don't really like advertising but I'd appreciate feedback on the general balance of the ideas, which is why I'm posting here. Thanks in advance for any feedback (you can also suggest changes for idea names/descriptions or suggest completely new idea sets, I'm not fussy).

Then I realized that adding ideas is actually fairly easy, so I went and did it. I know there's quite a few mods that add ideas but this one's mine. Plus, it gives me something to do.

Now, I can't really test all these (I only have so much time in the day), so if you can play a game with these or just have a look and judge the general balance of the ideas, it'd be much appreciated.

Also if you have an idea on what ideas/descriptions would need updating (some of them are pretty bare bones or just plain wrong because I couldn't find much on the country), then that'd be much appreciated too.

You can see the list of ideas on the Steam download page. It's rather small now but I plan on expanding the amount of ideas. I also added a few miscellaneous things.

**Note**: I tried to make Uzbek's ideas change when they form Bukhara but it doesn't work for some reason so if you can help with that, I wouldn't mind.

tl;dr: I made some ideas and I'd appreciate if you checked them out. Thanks.",eu4,In my boredom I came up with a few national idea sets and made a small mod to add them in,http://www.reddit.com/r/eu4/comments/3f5kyz/in_my_boredom_i_came_up_with_a_few_national_idea/
