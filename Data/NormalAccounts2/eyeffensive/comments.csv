The problem with trying to make this sword into a blunt is that even if you file or grind down the edge and tip, the blade will still be very *thin*. That thinness still gives it somewhat of an edge, so in reenactment it still might do some damage. The tip will also still deliver a nasty thrust even if blunted down quite a bit. 

That is also a nice sword that was made to be sharp. If anything you should sharpen it more and use it for cutting practice, to verify your edge alignment and technique. ",2016-11-12 17:59:25+00:00,d9xdssf,1.0,t3_5cbpu0,146491.0,SWORDS

31,"It seems that your story is pretty fantasy based, especially if your protagonist is using this kind of fantasy bladed gauntlet. Given that setting, you can just make her really fast and agile and she won't have any problems. To answer the questions inline: 

* The protagonist will be blocking with their arms, so they can cover their head and torso easily enough, but how does she block low blows to the legs? Maybe by sweeping the elbow blades you mentioned downwards? 
* Your second questions is actually related to your first question. Blocking and catching here are basically the same thing, she's putting her arms in the way of an incoming weapon. Whether or not that breaks her arms is up to you. In real life? That would definitely hurt and start to wear on her arms. In your fantasy setting? Completely up to you, maybe the gauntlets are magic and can absorb energy somehow, maybe she's got padding under them that absorbs impact. Catching a sword presents challenges as well. She doesn't have a hilt to catch the sword on, so if she catches the hilt with her hands or arms, that puts the blade somewhere...inside of her head. That's no good, so she has to catch the sword on the blade. Can she do this safely? Do her gauntlets have a way of catching a blade, is she doing it with her hands, are hands protected? 
* Again, because this is fantasy this is up to you. Because these are gauntlets, she is essentially fighting hand-to-hand, or weaponless. She has no reach beyond her arms, so she's at an immediate reach advantage. If she ISN'T fantastically fast/agile, then a longsword or spear or lance is going to present a significant problem, she will have to maneuver and feint a lot to get past any weapon with any kind of reach. 

Pros: 

* They protect the arms, and sound like they would be good for fighting unarmed opponents, or opponents armed with knives or similar gauntlets

Cons: 

* If these gauntlets have the massive elbow blades, how is she protected from cutting or stabbing herself accidentally? 
* Does the ""glove"" part of these gauntlets compromise her grip?
* Her reach is equal to an unarmed person, IE she has no reach
* If these are her only protection, then she does not have armor coverage anywhere else on her body, so she's completely reliant on these for her protection. HOWEVER, they are also her offensive weapon...so she is compromised, if she uses them for defense she can not present an offense. If she is using the gauntlets offensively, she cannot present a defense.  If the gauntlets break or are compromised, she has no defense OR offense. 

Overall, there is a reason we don't see clawed, elbow bladed gauntlets as offensive weapons in real life, there are lots of impractical and compromising issues with them. HOWEVER, because you are writing fantasy, then you can make them work in your world. Make her faster, make the gauntlets able to take a lot of abuse, make her able to present an offense with one gauntlet and defense with the other maybe, make her inhumanly agile to get past reach issues, etc. You can make any weird/abnormal weapon or armor work in a fantasy setting.

This definitely makes it more flashy than a scored match would be, but I don't think it makes it any less realistic, the techniques they are using are all actual techniques. ",2016-10-13 21:44:37+00:00,d8quw87,2.0,t1_d8qpty6,6425.0,SWORDS

I'm a pretty positive person, so I just kept a smile on my face and remembered that we are there to make people happy and hopefully bring a smile to their faces as well. Having a helmet on certainly helps, as it conceals your face if you frown or something makes you feel sad. 

Really, the best thing you can do is treat the children there like normal children, which they are, with some exceptions. Don't ask how they're doing, don't say things like ""get well soon"", basically don't call any attention to their health. Ask their name, where they are from, what their favorite star wars movie is, their favorite star wars character, ask them if they want to join the Empire or the Rebels, things like that. Ask about their favorite sports team, if they're reading a book ask about it, if they're watching a show remark that you like the show. I also made up stuff about how we were on a peacekeeping mission and thus were not allowed to carry blasters, made remarks about what a nice ""space ship"" they were living in and things of that nature. Overall, keep it light, keep your mood and energy positive. 

If you feel that you are going to be greatly impacted emotionally, I would suggest not doing the troop. It can definitely be intense and emotionally hard hitting. Do some lighter troops and interact with children on a normal basis, get some more insight on hospital troops, basically get prepped emotionally before you do a hospital troop.

The blade isn't as wide as the Crecy, which is an excellent cutter, so it might not cut quite as well as the Crecy, but still has a good shape for cutting. I can't see it having any issues with cutting, unless the edge that it is shipped with needs work, which is the case with a lot of sword makers.

53,"&gt; western swordplay is all about thrusting and hammering

False, longswords and other european swords from the period do cuts perfectly well, and we have many sources that contain lots of cuts as the primary attacks with the sword. Thrusting is more commonly practiced than in japanese swordplay, but ""hammering"" is not, unless you mean using the pommel to strike, which is done. 

&gt; whereas we europeans used the flat of the blade

False, the flat of the blade is weak and should not be used for binding or parrying. The ""flat of my strong"" view has been thoroughly debunked, use of the flat in general is overwhelmingly discouraged in HEMA circles. ",2016-10-11 19:55:53+00:00,d8ns1sc,,t1_d83lv6s,,SWORDS

This bit of information right here tells you a lot. $10 sword and $10 dagger. These are not valuable antiques.

It was made in the last 1-10 years or so, to sell for a profit. 

&gt; what was it purpose?

To make the creator a quick buck and to hang on the buyers wall, never to be used. 

&gt; Was it used for battle since the blade were sharp like a scalpel.

Highly doubt the blades on these are ""razor sharp"", please post video evidence if this is not the case. These were not used for ""battle"", otherwise they would have evidence of wear and usage, but that doesn't really matter because these swords weren't made during any period that such a ""battle"" would have taken place. 

These are stainless steel Pakistan made ""wall hangers"". These are purely decorative, non-functional sword-like-objects. You should not try to cut things with these, or even swing them around to hard, they will likely break and break dangerously.

If there's a longsword group nearby, I would totally join if I were you. For one, I think scottish Claymores are closer to longsword than a Montante. If you look at the [Chieftan](http://roninkatana.com/ronin-katana-two-handed-long-sword-7/) and [Ringeck](http://albion-swords.com/swords/albion/nextgen/sword-medieval-ringeck-xva.htm) swords by Albion, the difference is only about 10oz and a few centimeters. Conceivably, you could learn some longsword and that would help you use that kind of claymore. Once you get into larger swords, like the [Landesknecht](http://albion-swords.com/swords/albion/nextgen/sword-landesknecht-tyrolean.htm) though, then the technique becomes very different.

154,"I think these are both custom pieces, so sheaths might be tricky to find. You could definitely commission custom scabbards from a leather worker if you provide them the blade dimensions though. In my opinion, I'd display these as is. The patina on the metal is nice, and scabbards can sometimes introduce moisture issues, especially leather ones. I would run an oily cloth over these just to leave a light coating of protective oil and then display them as is! Don't clean them too much, as the patina actually helps dating and pricing for these kinds of antiques!  

I think these are custom for a few reasons. The 1832 Artillery style sword is absolutely supposed to be a short sword. With a blade that long, I think it was either commissioned that way OR purchased as a normal short sword then they had the blade changed out. 

The cruciform small sword has a custom hilt and possibly a custom blade. The hilt is certainly not like any of the examples I've seen in google searches, due to that horn grip and lack of a knight's head pommel. The knights head shows up in the crossguard instead, which is seen on some hilts I've found, along with the customary KP and FCB markings. The blade might be custom as well, owing to that engraving that I can't really make out, but again all the examples I've found in my searches so far have different blades and blade decoration choices. 

Overall, these aren't just your standard fraternal order swords, which is pretty neat! They appear to be custom jobs, certainly interesting finds! :)",2016-06-07 19:13:10+00:00,d3ztsbg,5.0,t1_d3zt6hu,766.0,SWORDS

161,"I train Fiore, and this is an easier move to pull off than you'd think, when you're in the right position. We mostly see this move when someone throws a thrust at you, but the thrust is coming too fast or too close to ""Exchange the Thrust."" (Where we parry and deliver our own thrust in one motion) In this situation, because of the immediate danger, we must ""Break the thrust"", which involves very quickly and strongly driving the opponent's sword to the ground with yours. 

You end up in a position where you are fairly close and can easily hit your opponent with a rising cut. But if you do that right away, you also free their sword from under yours. The solution? Trap the blade with your foot, then cut them with a rising cut. There is very little risk of your foot being cut, because the blade you are stepping on is trapped by your own blade, you can easily target the flat OR *place* your foot on the edge *then* force the blade down into the ground. It's viable and doable! :)

Lifting your foot should not compromise your balance when fighting, kicking is very useful when you get in these exchanges, especially if you get close in. In this same example, you could absolutely kick your opponents in the balls rather than step on their blade, it might even be more effective!

This is a pretty ballsy plan, but it's also terrible no matter what city you're in. Would that have worked in NYC? Definitely not. People on the street in any city aren't looking to meet random people and become friends, that isn't how it works. If someone came up to you on the street and just tried to have a conversation, wouldn't that feel incredibly strange? It would to me. I wouldn't beat myself up over it either, there's no way that was going to go well. 

Someone else already posted on here saying you need to go to meetups for your hobbies, that's definitely the way to go. The easiest way to meet people who you will get along with is to hang out in groups of people with interests similar to yours. Seattle has a ton of friendly nerds into all sorts of things. What do you like to do? Hiking or rock climbing? There are meetups for that, gyms and group hikes for that. Tabletop or board gaming? There are many gaming cafes and lounges where you can go play casually or sign up for a tournament. Martial arts? There are clubs for just about every martial art under the sun, I myself do HEMA (longsword fighting) and it's a blast. Whatever you like to do, I absolutely guarantee there's a group interested in it. 

There's also this Facebook group, Reddit Seattle: https://www.facebook.com/groups/rseattle12xy345/ , that I would totally join. It's a mix of trolling, genuine advice/ask/respond type posts, and then posts about meeting up for stuff. The group is a lot of fun, but if people start trolling you on there, **know that they are trying to make you feel welcome**. Trolling on that Facebook page is our sign of comradery. I'd be more worried if someone **didn't** poke fun at something I said, it's just the culture of the group. In person, everyone is super friendly, and I met my fiance at one of the meetups that was posted on that group! 

To echo some other good advice: Get out of your apartment, get out of downtown/cap hill. Check out Ballard, Fremont, the U-District, Lower Queen Anne, and Georgetown. Lower your expectations as well, that will lead to much less disappointment down the line. You may not meet anyone during a night out, but if your expectation was just to go to a new place and try a new beer, then you're golden.

192,"Looking at the 7 and 8 cross sections, it looks like the main reason that the fuller tips are more pronounced on the 8 is because of the concave shape of the blade. The sword in 7 has a more convex shape, so there's less material taken off where the fuller meets the rest of the blade. 

If you simply grind down the fuller tips on the blade seen in 8, your blade will lose a lot of strength, rigidity, and some critical thickness. I think it would be a huge pain, and you would gain very little. If you want a blade that's more like 7, you should get a new blade. As others have said, you can go from 7 to 8 by hollow grinding, but going from 8 to 7 isn't feasible. ",2016-03-21 18:51:11+00:00,d185th9,1.0,t3_4bc2gy,22600.0,SWORDS

Your wife has been planning this for a month and you knew about it before the tournament. Drop the tournament, spend time with the wife. Go to a tournament when you can dedicate the entire day/night to the event.

* They respond, my armor is not approvable. However, one of them puts me in touch with someone local selling a set of unassembled ATA armor. I buy said armor. 
* I sit on the ATA kit for over a year. Finally get the gumption to build the kit in October 2015. Build entire kit, following guides online

&gt;my first sword

Terrible. Idea. 

gabedamien already posted an excellent rundown, but I want to expand on why those two things above are a bad combination. As you can see from gabedamien's break down, authentic (authentic to me meaning Japanese Made) katana are either antiques or very expensive. That makes them a terrible choice for someone just starting out. Either you'll be paying a monstrous sum and wait a long time for a modern custom katana, or you'll end up with an antique that you can't use and shouldn't use, a collectors piece. In both cases you will be paying too much for an item that you do not know how to care for, use, or appreciate. I don't mean any offense here, it's just that if this is really your first sword, there's no way you have the level of appreciation and knowledge of care that's needed for a truly authentic, high end katana. The knowledge will come with experience! 

What I would recommend for someone that has NEVER owned a katana is first a boken, a wooden sword. Ideally you will find a club and train first before ever owning a steel sword. If you want one for cutting practice, the Practical and Mid-High end Chinese makers are the way to go. If you just want something for the wall, that's what Wallhangers are all about. 

There are also some Practical and Mid-High end katanas that would be perfectly suitable for display, as they look nice, but you have to remember that these would be SHARP and FUNCTIONAL, which is BAD if you only want it for display, because suddenly your display piece is much more dangerous than it needs to be.

My friend, the album you uploaded is *glorious* compared to the photos we normally get on this sub. They are well lit, not too blurry, and you got pictures of the important areas above the handguard, the ricasso where the maker's marks are placed. You've also included a ton of written detail. We need more posters like you!

Looking at these swords, they appear to be genuine British Wilkinson sabers. In this picture: http://i.imgur.com/pxo2aW4.jpg , the sword on the left is a Naval sword, the one on the right looks like a Rifles. I need someone more expert than myself to weigh in on the exact years and models, but looking at the markings on the ricasso near the hilt, they appear to have the correct markings and the small gold ""button"" in the ""star of david"". The blades are my favorite type, the Wilkinson pattern fullered blade. This means that it's either a model before the 1820's or after the 1840's. Between 1820-1845ish, British sabers had awful Pipe-backed blades that I hate. These were made either before or after that, but I'm not sure which. 

I don't think they're priceless, but these are certainly collector's items (unless there is some indication they are fake that I'm completely missing). Matt Easton sells sabers like these, you can find his swords and his pricing here, so you can get a general idea of what this sort of sword is worth: http://www.fioredeiliberi.org/antique-swords-uk/for-sale/",2016-01-09 07:58:00+00:00,cyrmfxf,1.0,t3_405d1r,3325.0,SWORDS

308,"Positive:

* Color - I'm partial to blue
* Grip slightly bigger - I wrapped cord over my Tinker hilt just to give it a slightly bigger grip, so I can see the advantage here

Critical:

* Tape - Looks crappy, and it will probably get sticky as it wears with use. I would suggest using cord or more leather, then using a lacquer or glue to bind it. 
* Grip material - Not sure what's used here, looks like it might be suede though? Suede is going to shed and generally not hold up to sparring and the sweat of your hands. It will probably give that blue a cool dirty look though, with time
* Wire - You used a single strand. If you twist two strands together first, it works better and looks better. It has ""teeth"" kinda that give it grip, unlike the single strand that's pretty smooth. Two twisted strands will also grip into the leather rather than cut into it, which it looks like the single strand might be doing already, but that might just be gaps in the grip material? The wire also doesn't look tight enough, it should be creating small valleys in the grip but it looks more like it's been loosely wrapped over the top, it may also come loose with sparring. 

This is just from what I can see though. If I held it in person, who knows, maybe it would feel really good! Either way, good on you for trying new things out!

Not really

Mount and Blade has quite realistic sword combat, it's honestly more intricate than For Honor looks. Multiple blocks to counter multiple attack types, shields only cover what their size allows and can be destroyed, arrows have decent physics and can't just be shot in a straight line (unless you're really really close), and weapon reach is factored in, even to the point that different swords have different reaches. I highly recommend people check out M&amp;B: Warband, the much better sequel, and it's expansion Viking Conquest. Both are excellent games that I feel are quite realistic to medieval combat.

You start off slow and ineffective, as you train and learn you get faster and better, and learn more techniques. Quite realistic, and very hard to beat enemies if you haven't trained and don't know what you're doing. Sadly this title is now a bit dated, but it was incredibly realistic and I still point to it as a great example of simulated sword combat. 

For Honor doesn't look realistic to me, at all. There's some defense/attack mechanics...woopee. There are still stupid spin moves and the costumes/visuals just scream ""action game"" to me, reminds me of the Dynasty Warriors series.  

Kingdom Come: Deliverance looks much more realistic, this was my first time watching the trailer for it. I have to look it up and learn more, it looks promising. But these games are by no means the first EVER games to feature realistic sword fighting. ",2015-07-18 00:53:33+00:00,ct77xwf,1.0,t3_3dodoz,8142.0,SWORDS
357,"Water bottles are actually a great cutting target. If your edge alignment is off, you'll hit the bottle instead of cutting it, gives you very immediate feedback. You can also use milk jugs, but I feel that those are an easier target, as they are larger and the plastic feels a bit thinner. I find them easier to cut, and find water bottles to be more of a challenge. 

Tatami, straw, or rolled paper are all good, soak your chosen material and wrap it around a wooden dowel and cut away. 

I don't recommend fruit of any sort. They're too easy to cut, for starters, so you don't learn anything. The juice is also full of acids that will stain and possibly ruin your blade too. ",2015-07-17 21:10:36+00:00,ct70meh,1.0,t3_3dn2uq,16190.0,SWORDS
358,"I own a white jacket, I honestly think it would be very hard to dye well. It's super thick, and I wouldn't want to get dye on the inside part. Not sure how I would go about dying just the outside. 

If anything I'm going to bleach mine. Everyone's stuff is already black, having white gear stands out. If you contact SPES directly they can do a green jacket for you, or any color really. They only list Black/White/Red on the site because that's what they keep in stock for ""off the shelf"" sales, but for customs I think they can do any color.

361,"Just noticed the sword that you're ordering. I ordered the **exact** same sword, also from KoA. I did not order the sharpening, it comes plenty sharp enough, that's the sword I use for my cutting practice. 

One note though, if you're doing longsword stuff then you might be better off with the Hanwei Tinker Longsword, it has a slightly longer grip and blade. It's much closer to the longswords I practice with, and I actually have to modify my grip a little when using the Hanwei Tinker Bastard. 

Here's the sharp Longsword: http://kultofathena.com/product.asp?item=SH2394 It is $40 more, but I believe that it is the better of the two, and I own the lesser. ",2015-07-11 03:47:35+00:00,csze9ok,3.0,t1_cszczox,2791.0,SWORDS
362,"I ordered a Universal saber from KoA and added the sharpening. I was not impressed with how the edge arrived, it is a very basic wedge edge, not nicely sharpened. I'm not honestly sure if they did any sharpening at all, I would have to compare it to an unsharpened model of the same sword. ",2015-07-10 23:31:40+00:00,csz6i05,1.0,t3_3cuqy0,1886.0,SWORDS
