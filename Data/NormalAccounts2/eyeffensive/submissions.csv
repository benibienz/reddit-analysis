I'm posting this because I've been asked before and don't know the answer. There are some Etsy Sellers who are selling decent looking Stormtrooper and Star Wars armor. Have any of these kits been 501st approved? Some of them even say ""501st Approved"" in the listing, like [This Listing](https://www.etsy.com/listing/224463746/clone-trooper-phase-2-life-size-helmet?ref=shop_home_active_5) which specifically says ""MEETS and/or EXCEEDS 501st club costuming requirements""

The same seller has a [ton of helmets and armor](https://www.etsy.com/shop/WarpCostumeGallerry), some of which looks good, but a lot of it just looks kinda...""off""

Has anyone purchased armor from Etsy and had it approved? Are these worth looking in to or should they be avoided? 

Thank you!

I recently got engaged and I'm looking into rings. I did some research because I know I want Tolkien elvish engraving, but didn't know the language/alphabet. I read about Quenya and Sindarin and it seemed that Sindarin is more appropriate. Then I found the phrases I wanted in Sindarin and found an online Tengwar translator to get them in the right alphabet. 

The two phrases are ""I love you"" and ""I know"", because on top of being huge Tolkien nerds, we're also huge Star Wars nerds. In Sindarin, that should be:

Gi Melin - I love you
Iston - I know

and in Tengwar it should look like this (providing that the translator is right):

I'm pretty excited for Star Wars EP VII, loving the look of the New Order Stormtroopers. I wanted to kick off a thread for any resources or research that's been done for that costume so far. 

Right now I have only a few contributions. I know that Anovos has made a set of this armor and had access to the suits used in the film, so there seems to be a lot of promise there. I had an email exchange with them, best estimate for when those will be available is Late 2015, which makes sense due to the film's release in December 2015. 

While looking for parts of the costume, I noticed that trooperbay.com is selling the New Order Stormtrooper gloves:

http://trooperbay.com/star-wars-tfa-stormtrooper-gloves-1371.html

I did some digging, and I think that these are CLC gloves, with the CLC logo removed:

http://goclc.com/products/Work-Gloves-Hybrid/2067

I've seen some random images of fans that have somehow already constructed costumes, and I know one guy is attempting to 3D print an entire suit, which is pretty ambitious, but that's about all I've heard so far.

About 2 years ago I sold my M1 Carbine to cover moving expenses. I'm well situated now and want to pick one up again, as it really was one of the best rifles I ever owned. I'd like to go with a new manufacture, as this will be a shooting rifle and not a collector's item. I was hoping to get some opinions on modern production M1 Carbines, who do you think makes the best carbine for the best price? My research so far:

* Fulton Armory - These look like the best modern production M1 Carbine I can find, but they are quite expensive, MSRP is about $1500. I haven't heard anything bad about them, other than the price and wait times. 

* James River Armory / Rockola - These also come highly recommended, MSRP $1250

* Inland - MKS, under the revived brand name Inland, started producing M1 Carbines somewhat recently. I haven't heard anything about them though. They seem to MSRP in the $800-900 range. Are they compatible with all M1 Carbine parts and magazines? Does anyone have good or bad experiences with this rifle? 

* Auto-Ordnance / Kahr - I've heard that this rifle has issues, and that not all the parts are compatible. MSRP is about $850. 

* IAI - The carbine I sold was an IAI. I don't think I'd pick another one up, I wasn't a big fan of the furniture, and the slide-lock had the tendency to disengage while cleaning. 

* Universal - Regular issues with cracking slides, they are not recommended

Those are the major ones I know of, if you know of any others feel free to tack them on! I'd also be interested in a ""shooter"" quality original M1 Carbine, just not sure where to find those anymore.

I moved to Seattle about 2 years ago and picked up a full kit about 1 year ago by contacting the local garrison representatives.

Is there anyone in the Seattle area with experience building TK kits? I've tried contacting the local garrison but I'm not getting a response. Alternatively, is there a company or anyone that builds suits for a fee? I really want to get this kit wearable before Episode VII comes out. 

Thank you in advance for any assistance. I have plenty of links to videos and tools, what I need now is actual, in-person assistance or a company/person that can build a suit.
