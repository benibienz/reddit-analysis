4,"If your cadets are REALLY good, we did a force-on-force lab.

1 squad were the ""Donovian forces"" operating against US forces in Atropia. Eveyone else in the platoon was US forces. 

They both started at different locations and began with a KLE, and depending on how the KLE went, the group would be given a certain amount of intel. I was part of Donovian forces, and we were told that US troops would be moving through an area, given by a grid coordinate. 

We set up am ambush using the tactics we've learned, and then sure enough, I saw my other platoon members, acting as US forces (wearing US flag, ACUs) walking towards us, in what looked like a leader's recon. We were able to take them down, and then the situation evolved for both groups. 

As part of the Donovian forces, we had the option to find the US ORP or wait, and the US forces had to decide whether to find their buddies and continue their attack as planned, or change the plan based on the fact the leader's recon didn't return. 

Overall, it was a very fun and eye-opening lab. Logistics included having an MSIV or 2 lane walkers to make sure people were dropping when they were obviously shot (kinda hard when you only have plastic dummy rifles to train with.) For uniform, US forces were in ACUs and Donivian in Multicam without US flag patch. (I'm at an SMC, so this is something we all had). Other than that, it was all a matter of planning it out on part of staff.",2016-11-10 01:18:37+00:00,d9tp0fh,1,t3_5c3rk1,14692,ROTC

And he did A pretty damn good job in my opinion. and now Apple is sticking to their guns with going for simplicity, and cutting the cords on the headphones. 

EDIT: In the biographical book, [Steve Jobs](https://www.amazon.com/Steve-Jobs-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1451648537) he even told Isaacson (the author) that he had plans to revolutionize the textbook industry, because he thought it ridiculous that a 21st century society had to carry around heavy textbooks to help with learning; and wanted to make something (an iPad app? a new tablet altogether? I dunno) to make textbook buying and using altogether through apple products.

3. throw in pan of hot oil until desired crispiness, flip, then remove from oil. 

4. put in baking pan, apply sauce and cheese, bake until cheese melts and chicken is fully cooked

**Chicken Parm Ingredients:**

* Chicken breast

* eggwash

* Flour

* breadcrumbs

Take the chicken and cut it as thin as you want it, you could do the whole breast if you wanted to. Then, evenly coat it with four, then eggwash, then breadcrumbs. Throw your breaded chicken in a pan of hot oil and let it get crispy! The thicker your slice of chicken, the less it will cook in the oil, so I had to throw mine in the oven while the pasta cooked. Once cooked, put on some sauce and mozzerella, and let it get nice and gooey. 

**Sauce ingredients:**

* 1 can crushed tomatoes

* garlic

* onions

* salt, papper, oregano, basil, etc...

Put the garlic and onions in the bottom of a pot to brown with  bit of oil. Once brown, pour in the crushed tomoatoes. Strir evenly and add spices as you see fit. Once it is boiling/really hot and tastes how you want it, it's ready. 

**Fettuccine ingredients:**

* Barilla Fettuccine

Take out desired amount from box and throw it in boiling water. takes about 10-15 minutes to cook. After cooking, strain and serve. I put the pasta on the bottom, some sauce, the chicken, then a bit more sauce. ",2016-04-19 14:48:10+00:00,d28wrn9,1,t3_4fhv1m,735,tonightsdinner

a few things I don't ike about him:

After my response, he'll rephrase exactly what I just said, but put it into his own words, and then he'll wait for me to agree with him. If he had a reddit, he would only repost old content and steal other people's comments. And he would do this LIKE IT WAS HIS JOB. 

- He speaks just for the purpose of speaking. A lot. He'll just say random shit, that definitely doesn't stimulate conversation, and isn't informative to either of us. And then If I don't give a reaction, he'll have a short conversation with himself out loud. 

- He's not his own person. He'll say he'll do stuff, or get something done, and then someone's opinion or invitation will keep him from doing it, and he procrastinates till the very last minute. 

- He plays league of legends. I'm trying to sleep at 12 midnight, but apparently 11PM-2AM is the only time LoL is available on his computer. So he sits there. talking away on his headset, sometimes yelling by 1AM, and clicking away at 10 clicks a second.

- Don't ask questions you already know the answer to or you have the means to answser on your own

- For fucks sake, be nice to people, and gossip is just childish at this point in your life

- Clearly communicate exactly what you're going to do. SO many relationships, professional and personal, go south because of implications and assumptions

- Plan for the worst, hope for the best, and no matter how well thought-out your plan was, something will ALWAYS go wrong, and be flexible and ready to adapt. 

- Be yourself. never fundamentally change who you are, but you can always add on to solid foundation.

- on avaerage, only 20% of the words that come out of your mouth will be productive, funny, or generally worthwhile. The other 80% is total needless bullshit. Try to bring down that 80%. 

- Some points in your life will be boring. Face it. You can make yourself feel better by posting how bored you are to facebook or whatever, but in the end, you're adding to that 80% of bullshit. Use that time to take a breather, and have some you time. 

- Sleep. Some nights in your future you won't have that luxury, so make sure you're getting a good amount of sleep throughout your day. 

- YOU WILL FUCK UP. If you don't, you're not being ambitious enough.
 
- Learn to be your own best friend. You're gonna be alone sometimes, find something you like to do.

He pulls out and tells her. “Um. something’s wrong, can you do something about that?” Betsy crinkles her face, then says, “Why of course! But it will run you another five bucks.” She pockets the fiver and goes to the bathroom and is back in no time.

&gt;The guy puts it back in and now, it’s the complete opposite: it’s the best feeling he’s ever had, and finishes in a flash.

I drink some water and then I notice my pants slowly getting tighter, as the monster slowly crept down through my intestine. I felt like I was actually going to explode. 
So I go to the toilet, pop a squat, and... nothing. It was shy. So I got my phone out, got on reddit, and a few well-placed puns later BOOM. It's out. 
The evac was relatively quick and painless, so I turned around and I was suddenly [crocodile dundee.](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/db/08/d8/db08d881a8bc90d54cbe81731385f316.jpg) My turd has circunavigated the entire bowl, yet reemained incredibly dense because I tried to flush it the first time, and IT DIDN""T WANNA GO. It positioned itself perpendicular to the toilet hole, and and it was big and strong enough to hold against the rushing flow of the toilet. 

Total, it took 3 flushes to get it down. I left the bathroom, and it felt like I lost 10 lbs., My belt was loose around my waist, and the balance had been restored to my universe. 

TL;DR: Giant dense turd. Took several flushes due to turd density and strategic positioning. Estimated 7 lbs. ",2015-12-25 08:55:31+00:00,cyauapr,1,t3_3y5zhs,2238,AskReddit

608,"Sorry, I was going for the idea that he changed appearence to the first doctor, then happened to turn back into Matt Smith. 

Something else I didn't express in my post: I was getting the idea that being a face-swapping time traveler wasn't his first idea, but he traveled through time for many years, many galactic civilizations, and has already taken on many forms and tried many different backstoriesbefore settling on his final identity as the doctor. 

You got me on the part about the other timelords. But, it could be his past/future self, experimenting with a different backstory. 

There is one plot hole that I can immediately think of an explanation to, which is the last 2 episodes of season 4, where the master attempts to release the time lords from Galifray, and take over the universe. There are multiple Time lords, and only 1 T-5000. 

I know this sounds pretty far fetched, but I think it's possibe. Maybe I posted it to the wrong subreddit, in which case, when it gets removed, i'll find a more appropriate subreddit. (I haven't been on r/fantheories, and wasn't sure how serious everyone would take this. it was more of a creative thought) [and i didn't watch the original series; but this is a show about time travel, and there have been cases where The Doctor takes on events in a non-chronological order]",2015-07-10 02:24:43+00:00,csy5moz,2,t1_csy36m9,4553,FanTheories
