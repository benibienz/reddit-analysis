Yesterday I loaded up the EZ curly bar with 25lb plates, and it still felt like I was just kinda twisting without any real burn going on. (I'm currently not using the olympib babells because I don't want to create a 2m radius of doom in my moderately busy gym).

for form, I usually put it on my back right about where I'd put the bar to squat, and twist until my shoulders are beyond 45 degrees in relation to my hips (I try to make my shoulders perpendicular to my hips, but I can't stretch that far).

It feels like the beginnings of a cramp, but it never cramps up, and theirs a light pain that comes with it that keeps me awake. It feels like I'm awake for the sensation of my muscles in the middle of recovery/muscle building. 

After I was awake until 3AM, I was able to shrug it off after a protein shake and get some sleep. 

My regular schedule is three days a week in the gym and on the off days I do a bodyweight workout (5x10 pushups, decline, weighted, and diamond; and then an ab workout). I also usually go to bed around 11PM, and I haven't been watching my diet so strictly because I'm on break from university.

I am an army ROTC student living in western NC who has barely been exposed to guns throughout my whole life. I am 18, and for my 19th birthday, I would like to get an AR-15. 

As I said, I haven't been exposed to guns much, and don't know where to really start. My dad is from europe, has been exposed to guns even less, and is very cautious about the topic; and the paperwork will probably go through him because it will be stored in HIS house. 

I plan to only use it as a training device because I was put on the spot with my ROTC's range simulator and was totally lost when trying to use it. I've got a few months until my birthday, so I would like to know things like
*paperwork I need to get to buy the rifle
     *supplemental paperwork for the above
*Good training videos
*what type of ammo to buy (I know this one sounds stupid, but go easy on me)
*suggested ways to get in-person training

Also, I would consider myself very emotionally stable, I'm mild mannered, and the only reason I want an AR-15 is because if I'm going into the army, I will be tested on how well I can shoot an M4, and the AR15 is the closest I can get; and GOOD airsoft training M4s cost the same as the real thing. 

EDIT: Another question that has arisen from the comments: What kind of cleaning/maintenence supplies should I get? Would you reccomend a kit that has most of what I need for long term cleaning/maintenence?

He has all the pieces: 
-A time Machine (with a circular interior, like the TARDIS)
-A face-swapping everlasting body
-The brains
-The ability to blend in with humans

After he [SPOILER] sends John Connor back in time, he is the sole surviving robot of skynet. He has to continue his existence to maintain skynet's foothold in the world, and the time machine is his best hope. He could further develop the time machine to fit in a smaller package (i.e. a police box). he is smater than all the rest of the Terminator army, forcing him to evolve, which drives him to explore the galaxy and study humans and aliens alike, so he can achieve universal domination. He pursued this for so long, the timelines became so scrambled, that instead of the terminator army being built, they devolve into the cybermen, which are such a far shadow of his 'ancestory' that he never sees anything that triggers him to pursue the last mission of skynet.
