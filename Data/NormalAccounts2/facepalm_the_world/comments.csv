115,"**Is it really a profitable way to earn money?**

When buying a successful passive income website, you'll have to pay much more than the website makes in a month, sometimes even more than it makes in 2 - 3 months. You'll also have to maintain the SEO of the website. Websites don't stay ranked if you stop working on their SEO. Either you will pay an outside firm to handle this for $x per month, or you will do this yourself.

**If so, do they provide a specific return on investment?**

There is no way to calculate a specific return on investment

**Do people actually just go around and buy websites and IF so, how do you run them all?**

I don't buy websites. I do have websites that earn passive income that I built, and ranked my self. I have automation software that takes care of that for me. I just have to pay for a server that I can run the software on, and tend to it every couple of days to make sure it's running fine.

**Anything else you can tell me about gathering a portfolio of websites would be really good too.**

These sites are called mini/micro niche sites. You can google to find out more about them, but usually they target long tailed keywords with low to medium competition. Make sure you research the website thoroughly, and make sure it actually makes money. ",2016-02-05 10:26:24+00:00,czoolqs,1.0,t3_44a0v5,5870.0,Entrepreneur

Step 5: Tell them about your friend in the UK. Something like ""My buddy is expanding to the US, and needs some websites for his portfolio so he is willing to give x% off to the first 10""
