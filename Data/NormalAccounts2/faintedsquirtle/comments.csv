1356," So any of these cdkey sites that you KNOW are trustworthy, use them. I know especially to trust sites like CDKEYS because they don't have the shield shit so if your key doesn't work. You can get a refund. I have ran into tons of trouble with G2A (Including them trying to scare me by saying they were preparing lawyers). If I had to say what site to use, I would say CDKEYS. No shield bullcrap so if the key doesn't work, (which it probably will work since they are all legit) You can just get a refund.
