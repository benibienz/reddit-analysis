5,"Wow I'm not even sure how I'd achieve firing the other flash with my old flash, I always figured it was just because they were wirelessly connected to the camera. Shows how much I know about flashes.

Definitely something in going to try before I go out on the shoot, that would be really useful. 

Yeah that's what I figured I'd do, bounce the light off the reflector, it's going to be quite cloudy to be fair so bouncing the flash was my main option, the lowest setting on my old flash was still quite bright, it was 1/125. Still ended up with the faces being quite white when I did a few test shots ealier this week. 

Thank you so much for you help and advice I really appreciate it. I think I'm going to go experiment quite a bit before we go and shoot. ",2016-10-29 01:46:37+00:00,d9c9spx,7.0,t1_d9c9icq,480,photography
6,"Hmm, I'm still new to flashes and such, lighting was never my forte. Going to have to find something to bounce the light off of to stop the harsh light on their faces. 

I kinda figured that I could use the diffuser on the flash when the flash head is directly up so it's not flashing them directly, maybe that won't work as well as I originally intended. I've ordered the flash though and have plenty of time to work on my skills. I'm the kind of person who learns by doing and watching, so there will be mistakes made. 

I will have someone with a reflector that would help diffuse the light properly so it might work. 

Where we're shooting is woodland so itll be a bit dark on the subject if I expose for the background which is what we wanted as we wanted the autumn orangy colours. ",2016-10-29 01:27:14+00:00,d9c93eb,5.0,t1_d9bx8rd,18281,photography

With the diffuser, I'm looking to use it with some ""model shots"" waist upwards so will be using a 24-70mm for the most part. After watching some tutorials it seemed pretty vital for better exposed photos. Maybe I'm wrong, I'm new to flash photography and more of a filmmaker then photographer.

Considering getting a better flash for my Sony A7s as the one I have isn't quite what I hoped it'd be.

It seems decent and its better than the one I have as it swivels and has a built in diffuser.

14,"Hi there, I currently have a A7s mk1 and have a little bit of photography to do in the coming weeks for my GF, nothing special just a couple of product shots of some knitted items she's made.

I'm thinking of getting a flash as something to play around with, was considering getting this flash:
 https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00ZU1MKGG/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_Crd9xbA56H555

Just something cheap and cheerful to play with. 

Questions are, is this going to be a decent enough flash for what I need?

And is there somewhere I can get a crash course of using a flash to learn the basics?

Is a flash going to be useful in this situation?

Probably going to set it against a white background and use my 28-70mm 3.5-5.6 lens for most of it. 

Thanks.

83,"So, my birthday has come and gone this past weekend and with my savings I have enough to buy the Canon 24-105mm f/4.0 which I'm hoping to purchase from a photography show next Monday, what I want to know is, is it worth it? 

To elaborate, I have a Canon 650d at the moment and have always thought that it'd be a good idea to invest in glass before another Camera. I mostly shoot video (/r/photography I know) with my friend for a small media company so hopefully we'll be buying a bigger Camera at some point (think c300) but already having access to better glass would bring the price down a bit for when we upgrade. But I also want to get into Photography more when I finish Uni so having a nice all round lens would be nice since I only currently have the 18-55mm Stock lens and a 50mm f/1.8.

Is it worth the £500 for the lens? Is there another lens I should consider? I don't know anyone with one so I can't ask their opinion but I have used the lens with a c100 and it was nice to use.",2016-03-14 16:49:21+00:00,d0zhz87,1.0,t3_4act7e,17248,photography
