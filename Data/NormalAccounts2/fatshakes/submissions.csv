Unfortunately last week I hit a bit of a bad pot hole in the road and damaged one of my alloys pretty badly, currently have a spare in and I'm looking to change all 4 wheels. 

My question is will this size wheel fit?

195/65/15 4x100? 

Not sure what I have at the moment but I know they're low profile 14 inch alloys that were on the car when I bought it. I'm looking to buy these alloys as they're cheap and come with decent treads on them.

Max would be £250 but looking for around £200 in the UK, if its available from Tesco Direct that's a personal benefit.

Good battery and performance, not looking for a power house just something that can run multiple Chrome tabs, stream movies and document work in Google Docs. Light Photoshop work would be nice but not a necessity.

* **How important is weight to you?**
Lighter the better hence looking at Netbooks.

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.**
Windows Preferred, but open to a Chromebook. 

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
11""-13"" would be nice, no bigger though. 

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.** 
Chrome mostly, little bit of Adobe Creative Cloud if possible but not expected. Maybe some Hearthstone as well.

Hearthstone would be nice.

I currently don't use any sort of password manager and after having someone show me how keepass works, I'm tempted to make the jump and swap over but have some questions. 

 1. How do I quickly log in to say, my Gmail, on a different PC if all my passwords are encrypted jargon? 

 2. If I use a USB device as a key to my passwords along with a master key, what happens if I loose that USB or it gets corrupted or something like that?

 3. Where are the passwords stored? If I add more entries do I have to them update the database file on Google drive every time? 

 4. Say I get a new phone and need to sign into my Gmail as I'm setting up the phone how do I get the password for it? I assume I'd have to type it in from the entry on my PC? 

These are probably very basic questions but I could just use some guidance.

I'm a third year student studying CGI &amp; digital effects doing my dissertation on advanced Green screening. 

I'm just wondering if anyone has some suggestions for books, articles or videos I could look at. 

The areas I'm covering are:

* A brief history of green screens

* Lighting - how to light both the green screen and the subject

* Cameras - Matching different distortion and noise

* Matching different cameras in post

* Colour spaces - how to go about matching them 

I will also be conducting my own experimentation by using different cameras and shooting some green screen footage to show how cameras with different chips, bit rates and such effect the quality of the key. 

Any help starting me off would be greatly appreciated.
