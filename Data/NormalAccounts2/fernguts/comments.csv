296,"Here in Nova Scotia we have hills that are named mountains. It's partly because they were named by people who'd never seen jagged mountains, but also because back then it didn't take much of a hill to be a major hindrance to transportation, particularly in the winter. We take it for granted in the age of reliable automobiles, paved roads, and snowplows, how easy it is to get around, but that's only been quite recent. 

To cite personal experience, I used to live on the 'North Mountain' in Nova Scotia, which as you can see in [this photo,](https://anotherwalkinthepark.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/pei_briarislandlight_canon-850.jpg) isn't very high, but it's enough to make it a couple of degrees cooler than the Valley. Many of Nova Scotia's big winter storms are right around the freezing mark, so there were numerous times where we'd receive large amounts of heavy wet snow, while the valley floor received no accumulation. Also, although the roads leading up and down the 'mountain' had switchbacks, they were still perilous when icy or snow covered. 

The difficulty of getting up and down the 'mountain' in the old days resulted in isolation, which then led some families into the arms incest.  There was one particularly lurid and famous case that took place on the 'South Mountain', on the other side of the Valley.

302,"I usually like the military route, but that would be tough for Nova Scotia.  Good thing Bluenosers are already over-represented in the military. 

Halifax is home to more than half the navy, but it takes more than that to fight a war.  Hopefully we can get Newfoundland to help us surprise New Brunswick, and capture CFB Gagetown, which is a major army base.  After that we'd have access to some more ground power. 

We'd then have to make an alliance with Quebec for two reasons: Firstly, they have many of Canada's CF-18s fighter jets at CFB Bagotville, and we'll need those on our side as we fight the Upper Canadians and westerners. Secondly, we need Quebec to allow our naval vessels into the Great Lakes, so we can bombard the shit out of Toronto. Whether or not there is a military necessity for that, it might be our only excuse to ever do so, and therefore must be done. With southern Ontario in our grasp we can pause, build armoured vehicles like crazy, and move the navy to the Pacific. 

By this point the Americans will have allowed us passage through their territory, so we can strike at the Prairies through its soft underbelly.  BC might put up a pretty good fight at the Rockies but they'll also be having to deal with amphibious landings on their west coast. In time, they too will be defeated.

Probably the toughest part will be the mopping up in northern Ontario and the Territories, where guerilla warfare might go on for years. Hopefully that won't be necessary, as we'll already have won military domination by then. 

Quebec of course will eventually have to be stabbed in the back, but that was the plan all along. ;)",2016-10-23 18:57:27+00:00,d94juzm,1.0,t3_58uuh0,83422.0,AskACanadian

408,"Fair enough. I'm not going to argue with that sentiment. 

The problem I have with cassettes is how inherently disposable they are, and therefore wasteful. Also I've lost so much good music over years when a cassette has worn out, stuff that is no longer available in *any* format. I had to beg one musician to digitise his stuff, even just for the sake of his children and grandchildren to have a listen.

 The tape in a cassette begins to stretch the moment it is played, and very few cassette-players don't put a lot of tension on the tape, not mention other hazards. After a bunch of plays, the music now longer sounds like it had been intended, and that's why I hate cassettes so much.  They were a necessary evil in the 80s, but digitial distribution is soooooo much better!

The sort of tourists who are drawn to the Arctic are likely quite interested in Inuit culture, so there's a great opportunity for education. 

 The cruise industry is far from an ideal partner, but in Atlantic Canada it's been the saviour of the tourist sector since traditional tourism largely dried-up after 9-11.

917,"&gt; if a device doesn't need to be grounded, what's the point in grounding it? 

I currently live in an old building, where only half the outlets are grounded.  That creates a huge amount of complication, and requires quite a few extension cords. 

&gt; Well, yes, but you really shouldn't be doing that, so....

It's not a matter of ""shouldn't"", as it's impossible to insert a grounded plug into an ungrounded outlet. That doesn't make it any less frustrating though.

&gt; I think the reasoning was based on safety.

That is correct, but it's only because Thomas Edison came up with the 110V number in the 1880s as the ""safe"" voltage for DC electricity. When AC eventually won out, North America kept the 110V standard, because it was deemed too complicated and expensive to change.

Cruise ships aren't built for storms, so they avoid them by sailing around them, or going into a port if they can't.   If a cruise ship does get caught in a storm, it's considered a major blunder on the part of the captain.  Ocean liners on the other hand are built much more sturdily (the Queen Mary II contains 40% more steel than a cruise ship of a similar size), but they are rare today.

1226,"There are four main types of annoying flies that we get in our homes in NS:

 FRUIT FLIES - small and drawn to food. Catch them by placing some cider and/or balsamic vinegar in a small bowl with a drop of soap to cut the surface tension. Tightly wrap plastic wrap over top, and poke a few holes in the centre. It works basically like a lobster trap.

 MIDGES - also small like fruit flies, but are drawn to light rather than food. The best way to catch them is with adhesive window strips [like these](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Raid-Window-Fly-Traps-4-count/28660082), which are basically flat pieces of flypaper. The strips aren't nice to look at, but they work very well. Just find a corner of a window that's not too obvious, and any fly in that zone will eventually find its way there.  Unlike fruit flies, midges are common year round. They tend to lay their eggs in potting soil that's damp and has become a bit mouldy, so always let the surface of your houseplants dry before rewatering.

 CLUSTER FLIES - more common in the country than the city. These strong and fast flies look a lot like houseflies, but they're generally disinterested in humans and their food. They spend most of the time at the window trying to get out, or attacking your desklamp at night. They can also be caught with the flypaper strips mentioned above.

HOUSEFLIES - these are the big and annoying flies that commonly land on people and food. I've never had an infestation of them, but apparently they can be caught with a larger version of the fruit fly trap that I mentioned earlier. [Google has lots of examples of trap designs](https://www.google.ca/search?q=house+fly+trap&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=wpqcV4r1L8u4jwSe1JeYAg)

1641," If you'll be sleeping at campgrounds, hiking mostly on maintained trails, and are not planning on going in snow (by August the snow will probably have melted on all of the trails), high-cut boots should not be necessary.  A rugged pair of hiking shoes, combined with a pole or two, are  enough for most fit people who don't have ankle conditions (you'll want at least one pole regardless of whether you go with boots or shoes). Besides, high-cut boots only provide a small amount more ankle support.  Also, if you go with shoes, you won't have to drag as heavy pair of footwear around on the rest of your adventure. 

I could give a list of the shoes and boots that I use, but what really matters is if the shoe fits *your* foot. The only way to assure that is to shop for them in person. Ordering online is a crap shoot. 

  Whatever you buy, just be sure to break them in thoroughly before hitting the trail. Hiking boots/shoes take longer to break in than regular shoes. ",2016-07-11 13:57:56+00:00,d57ul3d,1.0,t3_4saer8,9585.0,CampingGear

As someone who loves skiing and snowshoeing, that's a bummer, but the good news is that if you go inland you can find more snow. The moderating effect of the ocean means that the city of Halifax has noticeably warmer winters and cooler summers than places just a few kilometres inland. Many of Nova Scotia's big winter storms are close to the freezing point, so a degree or two can make the difference between rain or snow.

It helps that the Bluenose was a true working fishing schooner, and not just a rich person's racing yacht.

For one thing, [Mulroney was probably the most environmentally-concious PM Canada has had.](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/mulroney-honoured-for-environmental-record-1.616580) NAFTA of course was widely unpopular, but the Liberals didn't back out of it once they gained power, and Canadian voters didn't seem to care very much. 

My biggest beef with Mulroney is that he preached fiscal restraint while running up the deficit.  I think we should be reaching into the pockets of future generations only if we have a very good reason (i.e. a crisis).",2016-05-21 19:03:05+00:00,d3eduhy,2.0,t1_d3edrl1,138.0,HistoryPorn

There's been precisely zero solid evidence that there is anything buried on the island. Each new treasure hunter has added to the mythos though, particularly when they've need to squeeze more money out of their investors (e.g. the Discovery Network).  6 lives have been lost, but people just keep doubling-down on the myth.

3259,"It wasn't botched, but I was warned about the possibility of these complications beforehand. I've been in several times since then, and they seem happy with their handiwork.  I have large pupils, which used to give me great night vision, but now it sucks.  My pupils are so large in fact, that I was borderline for not being a candidate for LASIK. 

As a result of LASIK, I now get really bad starbursts, halos, and glare whenever I look at concentrated light (like [this](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7oFJJBrC-6c/hqdefault.jpg)). Even when I look at the Moon it's completely fuzzy, and I can't make out any features. It might be different looking through a lens, rather than with the naked eye. I loved stargazing when I was younger, but I now find it so depressing, that I avoid looking at the sky at night. 



I also now have severely dry eyes. I've had to get punctal eye plugs installed, which are pieces of silicone they insert into your tear duct to keep tears from flowing away as quickly. It's only helped a tiny bit.

  In order to drive at night I have to wear non-prescription glasses with an anti-glare coating, or the oncoming headlights would completely blind me. It rather sucks. Even though I now have ""better than 20/20 vision"", I actually have trouble reading text, either on paper or a screen. My experience has been worse than average, but is more common than the salespeople at LASIK imply.

I'm not prepared to dismiss the F-35, as it's far too early for that, but nor do I have the intense faith in the aircraft that many people in this thread appear to have.

A low price of oil also makes wind and solar energy less competitive than they otherwise would be.

My brother-in-law is a very involved dad, and he also complains about getting looks from people when he takes his girls out by himself.

Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,	 
  Old Time is still a-flying:	 
And this same flower that smiles to-day	 
  To-morrow will be dying.	 
 
The glorious lamp of heaven, the sun,	         
  The higher he 's a-getting,	 
The sooner will his race be run,	 
  And nearer he 's to setting.	 
 
That age is best which is the first,	 
  When youth and blood are warmer;	  
But being spent, the worse, and worst	 
  Times still succeed the former.	 
 
Then be not coy, but use your time,	 
  And while ye may, go marry:	 
For having lost but once your prime,	  
  You may for ever tarry.

4071,"I can put this one to rest.  I grew up in Nova Scotia, and the Oak Island mystery held such a deep fascination for me that I studied it at some length (being a historian helped).  Unfortunately, the story falls apart once you analyze it with any degree of skepticism. 

The original discovery happened so far back in history (1795) that the accounts of it are unreliable and often conflicting.  They don't even agree on the names of the original excavators. The accounts of the other early digs are also extremely sketchy, and none of the artifacts that people claimed to have discovered have survived. The claims made by 20th-century treasure seekers, including those of Dan Blankenship, are also completely unverified.  

So what *is* at Oak Island?  The answer is quite simple:  a natural sinkhole.  The geology of that region has many natural sinkholes that then fill up with dirt, stones, and logs. The original discoverers saw a depression in the ground, began to dig, and then assumed that the rocks and logs in the sinkhole had been placed there by humans. The ground under Oak Island is porous, and the ocean is just metres away, so of course it flooded once people dug down a certain distance. Later treasure seekers would make fanciful claims out of wishful thinking (just watch the TV show to see some of that), and in some cases likely fabricated evidence (such as the rune-marked stone) in order to appease investors who were hungry for tangible results. As more and more money was plowed into the project, and more and more lives were lost, the stakes and the myth rose even higher.  Nobody at this point wants to admit that all this effort was based on nothing but wishful thinking and lies.

If you have any specific questions, I should be able to answer them. I've watched every episode of the hilariously naive TV show ""Curse of Oak Island"", and should be able to debunk any of the specific claims they made on the show.  

TL;DR: There's nothing on Oak Island but a natural sinkhole, wishful thinking, and a lot of tall tales.",2016-03-17 12:56:35+00:00,d136fch,2.0,t1_d134zk2,3635.0,AskReddit

&gt;[ There are several folk etymologies for ""Pommy"" or ""Pom"". The best-documented of these is that ""Pommy"" originated as a contraction of ""pomegranate"". According to this explanation, ""pomegranate"" was Australian rhyming slang for ""immigrant"" (""Jimmy Grant"").Usage of ""pomegranate"" for English people may have been strengthened by a belief in Australia that sunburn occurred more frequently among English immigrants, turning those with fair skin the colour of pomegranates. Another explanation – now generally considered to be a false etymology – was that ""Pom"" or ""Pommy"" were derived from an acronym such as POM (""Prisoner of Millbank""), POME (""Prisoner of Mother England"") or POHMS (""Prisoner Of Her Majesty's Service"").

Whether it would have affected the trials is an interesting question, because the camps that were liberated by Allies were used as evidence at Nuremberg. Without such clear evidence, it's possible that a few of the accused might have had their charges lessened or even dropped. I don't pretend to be an expert in that area. 

One fairly certain result is that post-war, the Allies would be accused of taking part in the Holocaust by targeting the Jews and other minorities interred in the Nazi camps.  As it is, some people accuse them of purposefully allowing the Holocaust to go ahead, by not bombing rail lines leading to the camps.

4774,"&gt; * Description: Panoramic image of HMS Protector, in the vast and beautiful landscape of Antarctica.

&gt; On the 2nd December 2013, HMS Protector conducted a base inspection on the Ukrainian, Vernadsky Research Base. Vernadsky was established by the British Falkland Islands Dependencies survey in 1947. The main hut, built on the site of an earlier British Graham Land Expedition Hut, was named 'Wordie House' after Sir James Wordie, a member of Shackletons Imperial Trans Antarctic Expedition. Wordie House has been restored and is designated as Historic Site Monument No 62.

&gt; The Base was renamed Faraday Station in August 1977 in honour of British scientist Michael Faraday until Ukraine took over the operation of the base in February 1996.

To cite another example, the lake that I grew up on in Nova Scotia was rich with speckled trout when I was a boy, but sport fishermen have since introduced smallmouth bass, which have eaten almost all the trout. Now the only thing you can fish for are bass. Bass are apparently more ""fun"" to fish than trout, because they're easier to catch and they fight a lot more, but they don't taste nearly as good, and they don't naturally belong in our lake.

Many fans considered this to be ridiculous, and the hivemind settled on John Scott, as opposed to choosing a star player. This made the NHL furious, and there was talk that Scott wouldn't be allowed to play. Pressure from the fans in his favour has been so intense, that even though he's recently been sent down to the minors, he's going to get to play in the upcoming All Star Game.

5747,"&gt; Magdalene College is officially known as ""The College of Saint Mary Magdalene"", with ""Magdalene"" customarily pronounced ""Maudlyn"" (/ˈmɔːdlɨn/ MAWD-lin). The name was chosen when Thomas Audley re-founded and dedicated the college to Mary Magdalene in 1542. In early documents, the name of the college was spelt ""Maudleyn"" as it was pronounced, which contained the name ""Audley"" in the spelling. Although the standard pronunciation of the name ""Magdalene"" in the English language has changed, the customary pronunciation of the college's name was retained.

&gt; With the development of the General Post Office during the 19th century, the spelling of the college's name was fixed as ""Magdalene"". The final ""e"" in the name was introduced to avoid confusion with Magdalen College, Oxford.

6643,"There are a few mistakes and oversights in that post:



&gt; our airport is pretty irrelevant. We don't get many big flights.

The Halifax Stanfield  airport is the 8th largest in Canada (3.7 million passengers annually), and its runways can handle the largest planes in the world. It was one of the handful of sites in eastern North America where the Space Shuttle could have landed if something went wrong during liftoff.

Following the September 11 attacks the airport was part of Operation Yellow Ribbon, [when it took in 40 flights](http://www.accordcarhire.com/halifax_airport_runway_2019_400_400_1.jpg), more than any other Canadian airport involved in the operation, carrying about 7,300 passengers.

The Halifax airport [receives about two diverted flights on average per month](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/halifax-stanfield-international-airport-air-france-af055-1.3325810), much more so than most other airports, due its location as one of the most easterly locations in North America, and its proximity to large hospitals. 

&gt; the Halifax airport is not in Halifax. It's about a half hour away actually, not even really in HRM. It's in Enfield, my hometown, which is in Hants.

The airport is contained within the Halifax Regional Municipality.   The area defined by the village of Enfield straddles the border between the HRM and Hants county. 

 The airport is indeed a 1/2 hour drive from the city centre, but it's far from unique in that regard. It was built inland to keep it further away from the fog banks that wreath the coastline, which greatly cuts down on weather delays.

7169,"My favourite example of different peoples living peacefully together is near and dear to my own heart, namely relations between Anglophones and French-speaking Acadians in the Maritime Provinces of Canada. 

Most of the Acadians were [expelled between 1755 and 1764](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expulsion_of_the_Acadians), but they were allowed to return so long as they took an unqualified oath of allegiance, although most of their original lands had since been occupied.  One would have expected that to have created a great deal of mutual hatred, and although there have been and still are some tensions, it's remarkable is how little there has been, particularly in recent decades.  There's not only the language and cultural divide, but also a Catholic/Protestant one.  

I'm about as British-Canadian as they come, and I've known hundreds of Acadians in my life. Never once has one of them made me feel bad about my ancestry (except in teasing).  That's not to say they've forgotten what happened to their ancestors, quite the opposite. They don't however allow it to spoil the future, or to ruin their relations with their neighbours.

&gt; The Blackhawks have worked with the American Indian Center to help educate their community and fan base by sharing Native American culture and history. Scott Sypolt, executive counsel for the American Indian Center, commented on the logo and name controversy: ""There is a consensus among us that there’s a huge distinction between a sports team called the Redskins depicting native people as red, screaming, ignorant savages and a group like the Blackhawks honoring Black Hawk, a true Illinois historical figure."" He further added, ""The Blackhawks have been very genuine in wanting to help and have been very aware of cultural sensitivities. We're very appreciative of that. They live up to everything they say they're going to do.""  Joe Podlasek, the executive director of the American Indian Center of Chicago, commented on their relationship, stating, ""[The Hawks] are far and away ahead of everyone else in forward-thinking.

7353,"For a survival knife I strongly recommend something with a fixed blade and full tang.  That way you can use it to [baton wood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMp-xcyuaHw).  I also carry a small folding knife for more precise tasks.

I currently use a 6"" [Cold Steel SRK](http://www.amazon.com/Cold-Steel-Kraton-Handle-Concealex/dp/B000BSY9AS), and although  love it, I'm also looking to replace it.  It's the knife they issue to SEAL candidates during selection, so it's designed a bit more for combat than I need. I also wouldn't mind another couple inches of length so I can use it as a machete.    

My folding knife is [Spyderco Endura](http://www.amazon.com/Spyderco-Endura-Folding-Plain-Knife/dp/B001CZDNVU), and I'm madly in love with it.  My favourite part about it is that unlike most folding knives, the designers actually remembered that left-handed people exist.  It can be opened just as easily with either hand, and the clip can be attached to four different points.   

On a final note, I don't recommenced getting serrations on your knife. They make it much more difficult to keep sharp, and provide less control for some tasks. Unless you plan on using the knife mostly for cutting rope (e.g. for yachting), get a straight blade. ",2015-10-29 17:24:05+00:00,cwhcw44,1.0,t3_3qpyeh,3706.0,WildernessBackpacking

Motto: E MARI MERCES

**Origin/meaning**

The arms were not officially granted on November 10, 1998.

The golden cross is a St. Andrew's cross, which is taken from the arms of Scotland and refers to the fact that the city is tha capital of Nova Scotia, but also to the many inhabitants of Scottish descent. As the new council of Halifax was formed from four previous authorities, the cross also could symbolise these four authorities (city of Halifax, city of Dartmouth, county of Halifax and town of Bedford).

The ships are taken as a dymbol for Dartmouth, the arrows for Bedford. The kingfisher is the old symbol for Halifax itself. The blue colour and the ships also stand for the sea and the maritime connections. The crest shows a sprig of mayflower with four branches, one for each of the authorities. The mayflower was also part of the old arms. The compartment shows the island of Nova Scotia with forests and wheatsheaves as a symbol for agriculture. The two (heraldic) sea horses are an appropritae symbol for the municipality's maritime heritage. They hold the banners of Nova Scotia and the city. They wear a maple-leaf coronet as a symbol of Canada and a book for the advanced educational institutes in the city and two Micmac paddles as a symbol for the native people and early settlers.

The motto is E Mari Merces, or Weath from the Sea and was taken from the old arms of the city.

7527,"The future father of Queen Victoria, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn was stationed in Halifax, Nova Scotia in the late 18th-century, and he was responsible for many military reforms and improvements there. One of the most notable was the creation of a signal system that could not only let the main fortress know what was approaching the harbour-mouth, or hundreds of kilometres away at Annapolis Royal, but could also keep the prince informed of happenings while he snuggled with [his beloved French mistress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madame_de_Saint-Laurent) at his country lodge. 

The inland section was abandoned however when the enthusiastic prince was transferred to Gibraltar, and [most of its route has been lost to history.](https://novascotiahistory.wordpress.com/2013/12/19/where-the-heck-is-prince-edwards-telegraphsemaphore-line/)  Fortunately  though a piece of it lives on at the Halifax Citadel, where the [signal masts](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-B5Kxl5dJlhc/UgflOQT_PYI/AAAAAAAAGpE/mQ30tbUU1H4/s1600/IMG_5715.JPG) are still operated (the position of those black balls signify something, but I don't know exactly what).

She had to make a lot of adjustments, to say the least. Standard curriculum simply did not work with most of the kids, so instead she focused on projects and activities. The amount of substance abuse there is astronomical, as is the suicide rate, so if she could get even half of her class to actually show up and be sober, she considered it a good day. She would probably be quite critical of [this article](http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/nunavut-school-system-sets-students-up-to-fail-by-not-failing-them).

It was hoped that the creation of Nunavut would help to address many of the problems facing the Inuit, as they are by far the majority in the territory. Unfortunately most of the social problems have actually worsened since the territory became independent of the Northwest Territories in 1993. [This 2011 series of articles](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/nunavut/the-trials-of-nunavut-lament-for-an-arctic-nation/article547265/?page=all) examines what's taken place. 

 I really don't know what the solution is, because returning to a nomadic lifestyle isn't an option, but it's extremely difficult to import jobs to ultra-remote communities such as that.

I've hiked roughly half the Fundy Footpath from the Goose River side. If you have any questions I'd be happy to help. 

Edit:  Be sure to know the tide tables for when you plan to ford Goose River. That shortcut across the estuary is only accessible for a few hours each tidal cycle.  Otherwise you'll have to head well upstream and then backtrack. I've never tried that, so I don't know if there's even a trail. I do know though that the forest around there is very dense and difficult to bushwhack. In any case, I strongly recommend planning ahead to arrive at the river at low tide.

8627,"I've learned to embrace the short days of winter, and now I love them. They key is to rethink the darkness as being ""cosy"". Winter is the time of year to snuggle under a blanket with a good book and a cup of hot cocoa (or Scotch), or to binge-watch great TV shows. It's also a time for hobbies and projects. Most of all, winter is a perfect time for reflection.

Winter has also become my favourite time to be outdoors, as there's more quiet and solitude than at other times of the year. For example, beaches that are crawling with people during the summer months are often completely empty during the winter. As an added bonus, beachcombing is best in the winter, when the storms throw stuff up. (obligatory plug for /r/beachcombing[1] ) Star/moon-gazing is also waaay better in the winter.

Spending time outdoors during the few daylight hours is critically important. Exercise, fresh air, and natural light are all important for good mental and physical health, so get every bit that you can. If you live in a city, try squeezing in a short walk at lunch most days, and a longer one in a park on the weekend. The more natural and quiet the setting, the better. You'll be amazed at how differently it will make you feel about winter and yourself.

This remains the record for most weight gained by an actor for a movie, surpassing Robert De Niro's accumulation of 60 lb (27 kg) for the filming of Raging Bull. While filming an obstacle course scene for the movie, D'Onofrio injured his left knee, compounded by the excessive weight, which required surgical reconstruction. After filming of Full Metal Jacket was completed, having lost nearly all the weight gained for the movie in just nine months, D'Onofrio went on to play Dawson, the owner of 'Dawson's Garage' in Adventures in Babysitting.

9134,"From Wikipedia:

&gt; In some animals, the mother will gnaw through the cord, thus separating the placenta from the offspring. The cord along with the placenta is often eaten by the mother, to provide nourishment and to dispose of tissues that would otherwise attract scavengers or predators. In chimpanzees, the mother leaves the cord in place and nurses her young with the cord and placenta attached until the cord dries out and separates naturally, within a day of birth, at which time the cord is discarded. (This was first documented by zoologists in the wild in 1974.)

By the time the brief summer rolls around, most people are focused on spending time at their cottage or going camping. If they're going to fly somewhere, it's more likely Europe than Florida or Vegas, and that's probably because most Canadians don't like it when it gets *really* hot.  Canada also has a much lower population density, which makes owning a cottage in the countryside within reach of all middle-class Canadians, certainly compared to Europeans or Americans.

9312,"&gt; I agree that it is a marker that ""I was here"" - that was the main purpose of the original inuksuks[1] made by the Arctic aboriginals.

The Inuit live in an environment almost completely devoid of humans, so it's not really a fair comparison to the few wilderness places near where most of us live.  

&gt;  However, I don't really think it's akin to spray painting. It doesn't damage the environment, it's not very permanent, and it's perfectly natural. 

It does damage the environment in the sense that it changes it from its natural state for no purpose whatsoever, other than human hubris. You say it's not very permanent, but a sturdy stack of rocks is likely to remain long after spraypaint has worn away.   

The need of some people to leave their mark on everything is not very admirable IMO, and I wish they'd lay off it altogether.

9526,"The Nazis and Soviets were at peace in 1940, and [at least on paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop_Pact) they were closer to being in an alliance than being at war, so there was no ""Soviet problem"" to be dealt with. There are a few historians who make the case that the Soviets were poised to invade Germany in 1941, but it's not widely accepted on either side due to lack of evidence.

Hitler chose to attack Russia before finishing off Britain because he thought Britain was on its knees, and posed no imminent future threat. In fact he expected they would eventually stop fighting his ""great Germanic cause"", as he had considerable personal respect for how successful the British Empire had been, and gave the credit for that to its supposedly Anglo-Saxon (i.e. Germanic) leadership.

 Hitler felt pressure to attack the Soviet Union as soon as possible because he knew their military was in a period of temporary weakness of leadership, due to what's now known as the [Great Purge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Purge).

9538,"When you first encounter the bear, puff yourself up to look big, then slowly back away while talking to the bear in a calm, deep voice (I usually find myself apologising for intruding). Leave your backpack on, because it will protect your back if you are attacked. 

Black bears can be frightened away with noise, but I generally just take a wide berth around them.  Black bears are more likely to come into your camp looking for food (even though you shouldn't have food in your campsite) than are Grizzlies. If they do, scaring them away with noise is probably your best bet. I've often woken up a night to the sound of a bear near my tent, and I just softly talk to them in a low voice, to make sure they know that you're a human and not something tasty.  I usually find myself explaining to the bear that I was here first, but I'll be gone in the morning. 

 If you are attacked by a Black bear, do *not* play dead, as the bear may start eating you.  Playing dead with a Grizzly (especially a mother with cubs) might work though. If you are attacked, go for the nose and eyes at first, but then turtle if the attack persists (i.e. roll yourself in a ball to project your vitals). 

 Do *not* run, even if the bear charges you. Many charges are false (the bear will stop before reaching you), and running will only trigger its predator instinct. For that matter, it is pointless to run from a bear, even if you're Usain Bolt, as bears can run up to 60 km/hr. It's also a myth that bears can't run down hills. In fact they can do it a lot better than we can.  Similarly, don't try to escape a Black bear by climbing a tree, as they're better climbers than we are.

The most important thing to remember is that we are not part of their regular diet, and most of the time they are more afraid of you than vice versa. There are many, many bear encounters every year (I've had over 30 so far in my life), but very few of them result in attacks. 

Also, *please* don't take a selfie with a bear.  That trend is pissing me off.

If I hadn't, the seal would have died a death of unbelievable pain and suffering, and I couldn't just walk away from that, even though I'm aware that that sort of thing is constantly taking place all around us.

Don't get me wrong, I'm quite sentimental when it comes to animals. Nearly all of the meat I eat is organic or at least free-range.  I have a friend who runs an organic farm, and her animals live very happy lives right up until the moment they're slaughtered.  Compared to the inherent suffering in the natural world, it's *nothing* to get upset about. ",2015-06-21 15:56:57+00:00,csdv9ud,6.0,t1_csduvs9,853.0,howto

In cold weather, it also helps to assure that your water bottle won't freeze overnight.   


 If your hands are getting cold while sitting in front of a fire, you are underdressed. Gloves work even better than chemical heating pads, and are a lot cheaper and simpler.  It should also be noted that chemical heating pads don't actually give off enough heat to dry wet boots, other than superficially.
