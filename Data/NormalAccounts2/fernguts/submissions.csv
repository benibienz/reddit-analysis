I'd always assumed that everybody knew that they should not be encouraged. 

As well as being noisy and bad for native birds, the poop of starlings is particularly caustic, and eats away at stone and masonry. Our city would be both prettier and quieter with fewer starlings.  On top of all of that, they also carry a range of internal and external parasites.

Seriously, *please* don't feed the starlings!!!

PS: In case you're curious how starlings got to North America, some dingbat in 1800s New York decided it would be cool if every bird mentioned in the works of William Shakespeare was living in Central Park.  Those few birds went on to populate the entire continent in just a few years. ",halifax,"If you know somebody who feeds starlings, please ask them to stop.

I noticed a male downy woodpecker sitting on top of the wooden suet feeder but didn't think anything about it, until I saw that he was still there half an hour later. I could see him twitch every once in awhile so I knew he wasn't dead, but it seemed like an oddly exposed place to take a nap. Downy woodpeckers are quite bold, but I'd never seen anything quite like it before. 

I came back after another 20 minutes or so, and was surprised to see a female downy woodpecker eating from the suet feeder, while the male downy had moved over to a different suet feeder (one of the orange bag thingies), and was happily eating away.

From my observations it appeared as if the male downy had been waiting for the female to arrive, and perhaps even guarding the suet for her. The other possibility is that she simply arrived and interrupted his nap, and watching her eat made him hungry too, so he joined in. I prefer the former narrative of course, as it's more romantic, but what do you think?",Ornithology,I witnessed some odd feeding behaviour in downy woodpeckers that I'd like to hear your thoughts on,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ornithology/comments/4e0wp0/i_witnessed_some_odd_feeding_behaviour_in_downy/
