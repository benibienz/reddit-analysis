4,"In the US, I feel that the primary issue is that running for town council, attending meetings, and setting local policy is not really something that's lucrative nor is it popular. It is hundred times more ""cool"" of an idea  making millions off of selling records, starting a new company, or going into banking or something. And I don't mean this is what I personally feel, this is *what society by and large seems to think*. 

To make it short, politics needs to market itself a bit better. When you ask a kids what they want to be when they grow up, it's not, ""become a president"" it's:

1. Pro Athelete
2. Doctor
3. Don't know
4. Teacher
5. Veterinarian
6. Firefighter
7. Scientist
8. Astronaut
9. Engineer
10. Police

(Source: [Fatherly](https://www.fatherly.com/kids-health-and-development/what-kids-want-to-be-when-they-grow-up/))

Being in politics to these kids is *boring*. It sucks, and 24-7 coverage of borderline slander and libel to smear the reputation of political candidates, shows like ""House of Cards"" really doesn't help. 

Now I'm not saying any of those 10 things kids want to be aren't respectable, I'm not saying the 24-7 coverage don't have merit at all, I'm also not saying shows like ""House of Cards"" are to be frowned upon. I'm pointing out though that there is a significant lack of incentive for people to be politically active right now, and to a certain point there is honestly a incentive to not.

I decided to do some replacing of numbers, and indeed figured out that indeed Meek Mill and Drake had statistically significantly affected traffic to my website. 

It was a self indulgent endeavor but I found it funny that the same formula used to figure out whether Nazi's can aim used in the forties was able to be applied to figure out whether Meek and Drake really mattered or not.

Well the average lawyer you would have hired is well versed in Delaware law, so if your company is based out of Delaware, it's easy.

That is the first thing I read about this game with it being the first part of the introduction you wrote, and I think you can reword it and tweak it. Because as it stands it, 

a) makes me want to compare the game to Battlefield when I didn't even begin to do that.

b) catches my attention again with the ""relaxation tool"" bit.

c) catches me off guard by hearing something deeply personal to you.

All in all with your comparison to big budget titles and your expression of sadness it comes across as if we need to feel a sense of pity when supporting this game. 

Something like:

""In what some redditors have called, ""the most relaxing experience"", Lost World Zero is a first person adventure that aims to explore fantastic visuals coupled with a calming soundscape. Explore a planet collecting its resources, building and acquiring vehicles to take your further and further into a world of color. 

What first was inspired by the author's dealings with his/her/their hardships in his/her/their life comes an adventure that not only aims to intrigue you, but to soothe and help the players relax and take a little bit of time away from their daily dealings. 

Look forward to getting lost, start counting from zero again.

Lost World Zero. ""

..would make the game pop, capture and expand the imagination of potential users I think. I really love how the game looks and sounds, don't sell yourself short from the get go. 

Also in the video, when you mentioned ""purchase"" you meant using in-game currency right? I'd take that out because people are going to immediately think it's a free-to-play ploy.

And actually, informing people like you is part of increasing funding in treatment. People like you spread misinformation, and are a part of the voice that paints a picture that drug addicts are inherently ""bad people"".

This article, by former Secretary of War Henry Stimson, was the first clear and detailed justification for the atomic bombing, complete with details about the decision- making process used, published by someone who had been in a top-level cabinet position at the time.
On September 9, 1946 (a few days after the publication of ""Hiroshima"") Navy Admiral William F. Halsey, Third Fleet commander, was quoted in the press as saying that the Japanese had been on the verge of surrunder before the atom bombs were dropped in the summer of 1945 and that the ""atomic bomb was an unnecessary experiment..."" [22] Halsey's statements, and The New Yorker's ""Hiroshima,"" prompted Norman Cousins to write an editorial in the September 14 issue of the Saturday Review of Literature harshly criticizing the decision to drop the bombs and calling on Americans to contemplate the morality of nuclear armaments.

I believe everything you research, study, etc, you should be thinking actively, in a entrepreneurial sense. Thinking what business you might be able to create by being the expert on certain things.

The hammer and sickle was adopted as the symbol for communism by Lenin in 1923. 

The Arm and Hammer was adopted as the logo for the socialist party of America in 1904.

The Arm and Hammer logo you know from baking soda was adopted by Church and Co. ever since 1867. 

It's a really old idea, it represented Vulcan (God of fire and subsequently the God of smithing) in some points in time, and of course, a very iconic example of a hammer representing and entity is by way of Thor's hammer. 

What can definitely be said is that the idea of a arm holding a hammer being a symbol is an idea much older than Lenin.

304,"In Japan, if one mentions ぶっかけ, the immediate thought would be that you are talking about food. It literally means to ""spill upon"", to ""shower with"". One would eat bukkake-udon, which is where a bunch of spices and cut up chives, roasted meats and a broth is ""bukkake""ed on to a bowl of udon. The Japanese pornographic industry took this word and appropriated it, and in turn, with Japanese pornographic material being disproportionately represented comparatively to Japanese food culture, the word has almost exclusively taken a pornographic meaning in the English speaking countries. 

In a sense it is the like the word ""hentai"". In English speaking countries, this is used to describe erotic graphic novels drawn in a Japanese manga style. In Japan, this word merely means ""pervert"". So to ask a Japanese person with not so much exposure to English conversation, ""Do you like hentai?"", that would simply translate to, ""Do you like pervert?"". Which makes no grammatical sense much less making for a good conversation topic to begin with.

A simple case would be creating a fair ""two sided"" die. (Of course practically you would probably just flip a coin) Label three sides of a six sided die heads and the other three tails and you have a fair ""two sided die""

Of course this becomes more complicated with higher  numbers but I do believe you can create a fair any integer faced die this way by combining multiple dice; for an example and mapping the set of combinations to another set of numbers. 

A twelve sided die can be simulated with a three sided die and a four sided one with the first roll being from a four sided one and the second from the fourth:

When you get (1,1) count that as rolling (1),
(1,2) is rolling a (2) and so on and so forth until you get (3,4) being rolling a (12). Then you have a fair chance to get any of the twelve ""faces"".

He also brags about how little he had to do in college at Brown, claiming that the university wouldn't kick him out because of his family's fortune.

&gt;''In my entire first year,'' he said, ''I think I attended less than eight academic commitments.''

442,"I liked this video but I'm not really sure I enjoy how he has made it a point to justify how quickly he produces his projects. In general, I think it's a bit worrisome that there are so many videos out there now that value quickly making something that's passable. (e.g. Watch this guy make a beautiful landscape in 5 min!) I do think that's a product of this generation's vine-minded era that wants everything in a gif...okay, I digress, I'm sounding like Clint Eastwood's character from Gran Torino, back to my point. 

For an example in the video he says:

&gt; With the quick deadlines, I have no choice.

But I really do think a part of the reason why he has those quick deadlines is because he set himself up to be that sort of business. He probably is known by his colleagues as the the guy who can create 10 logos in 10 days. (Just an example). 

I do understand his logic, that giving yourself a short time to create things forces one to make quick decisions, and in turn makes him more confident in his abilities. But on the other hand I don't enjoy how he criticizes the method of taking time to create something as a process that avails itself to ""Stupid decisions and stupid mistakes"".

I understand what he's saying but I disagree. I believe you can create something in a short amount of time and create something professional, a lot of people do that, including this guy. Being professional by simple definition is about being paid to do work or not. But if one defines their work as being good enough, because it is good enough to get paid for, nobody is ever going to create masterpieces that will be revered across time and culture.

A chapel can simply be a room with a cross. But it takes three years of painting a ceiling that creates the Sistine Chapel's ceiling.

454,"Wow my Dad too. He had just gotten a new phone number, no body knew his contact info except for people at work and immediate family.

He gets a call during a meeting from an old lady. 

""死んじまったよ！"" the lady says, giggling, happy. It means, ""I died!"", but it's in an aloof, joking manner. Like, ""whoops! I'm dead!""

My dad comes home from work, and finds my mom crying. Her grandmother had just passed. Right around when my father got his call from the woman. 

See, we all knew she was near passing. We all visited her, spoke a few words, except my dad. My dad visited but wasn't able to speak with her since she was so tired and asleep at the time. 

We like to think it was my great grandma saying a final ""Hey, are you taking care of my grand daughter right?""

And you will have some contemporary artists being like, 

""I love the deconstruction of the canine form, the use of wood is obviously a reference to the transient nature of a pet, while the eyes are made of metal, that represents the ever lasting memories of an owner has of his or her canine companion"".
