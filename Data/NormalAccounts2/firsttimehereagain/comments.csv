A constant and powerful enough heat source though may prevent the build up in the first place or melt the snow quickly enough to prevent problems on the roof. 

Then all you have to deal with is all that coming down your eavestroughs and into snow, either freezing there and backing up the water or getting trapped in the snow or soil near the drainage pipe, saturating, refreezing and ice-jacking against your foundation. 

So a few kinks to work out in the north. ",2016-11-01 21:21:27+00:00,d9hew5u,5,t1_d9h5g6s,10939,Futurology
1,"From a discussion I attended years ago, Romeo Dallaire basically attributed the failure to the absolute reluctance of Western nations (esp. Belgium) to take casualties. Generals on both Rwandan sides knew this as they were all Western educated and would shoot at UN soldiers interfering with high value targets. It wasn't that they were impartial at all, but that they wouldn't engage the evil they knew. ",2016-06-02 21:16:01+00:00,d3tmmc7,4,t1_d3t49f9,24107,history
