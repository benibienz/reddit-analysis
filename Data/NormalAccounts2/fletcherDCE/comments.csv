He gave the ball away for Swanseas goal but so many of our players this match gave cheap passes to lose possession.

What I want to know though is why he's so uncomfortable to shoot with his left... he could've easily had two shots on goal, if not two goals, had he shot with his left foot and all of a sudden people would be praising him.
