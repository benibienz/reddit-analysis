96,"In my experiences living at home with parents and in a dorm with RAs. Any burning of weed that produces smoke is a big no no (bowl, joint, bong, etc). No matter how much you dont think it wont reek it will, very bad. If you want to smoke with other people home vapor is pretty much the only option. I use a wax pen, towel under the door, sploof blown directly out the window and ozium and even that smells a liittle bit, but dissipates quickly. If you dont have access to concentrates id look into a decent vaporizer and minimize your packing time. These would be your best bets but still pose a bit of a risk, still be careful.
