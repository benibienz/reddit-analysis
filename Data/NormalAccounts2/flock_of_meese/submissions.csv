Since making the last post my ford explorer started stalling while driving, not just at lights or when shifting from reverse to drive. The revs will be steady around 2000-2500 while driving and just drop to 0, when it stalls the power steering stops working and the brakes get very stiff. Occasionally after i start it back up the revs will bounce all over for minute or so before going back to normal. The last few times it stalled on me it had some trouble starting up again (During this trip it stalled 6 times in a 15-20 minute drive). I have since replaced the thermostat but the problem still occurs (i have checked for leaks and burning coolant smell). I noticed the problem occurs more often when the AC is on but still occasionally when it is off. Yesterday i took it up to the mechanic and they could not figure it out. Before taking it to the mechanic i took it back to autozone to get the chip read and it still says to replace the thermostat. My guess is the idle air control valve or the O2 sensor but i am no expert.",Cartalk,"car stalling, gas smell, check engine light, mechanics cant figure out the problem.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/4ldbuo/car_stalling_gas_smell_check_engine_light/

Soon after taking it home it began stalling when shifting between drive and reverse or vice versa. After i put it in park and restart it runs great. I never had any issues with it stalling in drive until yesterday when it stalled at a stop light. I took it to autozone today to get the chip read and the only code that came up was P0125 Insufficient coolant Temperature for closed loop, So they recommended replacing my thermostat since i just got my coolant levels checked. But this does not make much sense to me since i have experienced no overheating problems. Also when looking up the symptoms a thermostat was never mentioned. My previous guess was a bad O2 sensor, but im not completely sure, what else could be causing this? 
Edit: just lost power steering and stalled again when pulling in the driveway after putting a tank of gas and fuel system cleaner in

Last night i decided to take some nyquil to help me sleep, but i completely forgot i am very sensitive to dxm and it makes me super jittery.

Got up took a dab and another 25g or 50mg (dont remember) benedryl and 5mg of melatonin, by this point im deleriously tired but the dxm is not letting me sleep. 
The exact timeline of things is a bit fuzzy but i could feel this pulsing though my body and i felt like my consciousness was completely separated from my body but connected at the same time? I felt like i could feel the edge of my consiousness. At one point my heart was racing and i felt like i was going to die die, i could feel the outside world pushing in on me. I could feel the life in my body and exactly where it ended at the surface of my skin. I was having some closed eye visuals and i felt like my head was getting twisted into the darkness around me.  I had to talk myself through at least one panic attack, and try to fight off the thought spirals i kept getting dragged into. When i tried to walk i felt really off balance and like i couldn't walk straight.
Has anyone had an experience like this before? I did not intend for anything like this to happen so i was really caught off guard by it all.  In total i think i took around 15-20mg of dxm via nyquil, around 100-125mg benedryl (4-5 pills), 5mg of melatonin and one dab.
