Huh? You can hide the task bar in windows and switch between apps with the keyboard just fine. Literally the same shortcuts IIRC. Unless you meant something else.

The reason instruments are transposing is so that you can switch to your Eb clarinet, see that you have to play a C and use the same fingering as you used on your Bb. The fact it sounds different doesn't matter - the hard work will have been done already by the composer or arranger - you will be able to pick up that instrument and play it straight away, with just a little adjustment of embouchure.",2015-10-07 09:23:21+00:00,cvr3q6i,1,t3_3ntboa,6613,explainlikeimfive

48,"I'd probably do a combination. For I'd likely  EQ kick &amp; snare to be both brighter and beefier, compress them to *nearly* punchy enough, then leave the rest to bus compression. I'd also route the whole kit through a bus for your base sound, but use an aux send from that to create a super over compressed sound and then mix that back in at a low level to give the whole thing a bit more energy.

I'd recommend bringing a reference track of something professional in a similar vein into your session and ABing the sound you have with theirs; it makes for pretty good motivation!

Hope that helps :)",2015-06-16 11:04:00+00:00,cs88fsi,3,t1_cs80kex,25935,RateMyAudio
