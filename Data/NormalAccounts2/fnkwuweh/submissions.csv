As unlikely as it is, has anyone seen a black pannier bag with blue trim around the bottom of five ways hill on the south pedestrian side? [Here](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@52.4676459,-1.9043262,21z)

It has in it, among various flavour of bag-clutter, a pair of Jabra Move headphones, a Zoom H2.n portable recorder, and most importantly, an **iLok key** (has my Pro Tools licence on it, which I need for work). It's also packed full of business cards with my name and contact details on, as well as those of various businesses that I or my friends run.

If not, can anyone advise on how to report it as missing? The West Midlands Police website isn't dreadfully helpful.",brum,Fell off my bike - lost my bag!,https://www.reddit.com/r/brum/comments/5cb8iw/fell_off_my_bike_lost_my_bag/
