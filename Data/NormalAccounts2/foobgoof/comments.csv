It's very difficult to practice the swing without some sort of pole. If you can use a stubby, or even a broom handle, that's the best. As always though, don't forget to hit the weight room too. Best thing you can do is think about that nice rowing motion and swinging your legs back past the pole.

Weasley's Mismeasuring Tape

**What do you use this product for? (3 points)**

Frustrating your classmates for your own sadistic pleasure.

**What exactly happens to the person/place/animal after it's used? How is this undone? (5 points)**

The Weasley's Mismeasuring Tape is exactly what you don't want in a measuring device. It looks like a normal, plain old measuring tape often used for measuring essays until it is picked up. Then its markings are unevenly spaced, constantly moving, and it will never tell you the measurement of whatever is being measured. Just swap it out for a friend's measuring tape while they are writing an essay, and watch from afar while they try to measure how much they've written, only to find that a foot is now three inches and an inch is now a mile.

**Severity Scale (0-10 10 being the most foul products): How much is this product due to its effects? Are there any warning labels or restrictions? (10 points)**

The Mismeasuring Tape has achieved a 4/10 on the severity scale. While giving inacurate measurements isn't exactly the most evil thing in the world, they have been known to slip out of bags and trip passersby when they don't get used often enough. There was one reported incident during testing where it chased the testers around the room, cracking itself like a whip until it made contact with one of the testers, leaving a nasty welt on his buttock. This product should not be left unattended and should not be left with children under the age of eight.

**Marketing Scheme to Sell the Product (5 points)**

Just put them on the shelves and watch as they grab people's attention--literally.

**Show us an image of your product (5 points guaranteed) [Note that bonus images must be your own work, any student who posts other's work or images from the internet will not have their assignment graded]**

187,"The Manx Brownie

Brownies are helpful household spirits. They love to help humans, but if you anger a Brownie it will destroy anything it desires, and may even transform itself into a Bogie. Brownies tend to live with individual families for long amounts of time, and are very loyal to this family. It is bad luck to lose or anger the family Brownie. They will sometimes disappear if they are seen by a human, are given human clothes, or are baptized. Brownies can be befriended by offerings of bread and cream left for them to find instead of being given them in person as they enjoy their privacy. They have a special friendship with bees, though they are friendly with all animals. Robin Goodfellow may be a Brownie. Names of known Brownies include Aiken Drum, Maggy Moloch, Mieg Moulach, and Puddlefoot (not to be confused with Padfoot, the Alias of the unregistered animagus James Potter). Brownies like to dress in brown and have shaggy brown hair. Some have been known to have two nostrils but no nose, webbed fingers or toes, or hands like mittens. They are humanoid, but are much smaller than humans, standing about a yard tall when fully grown. The difference between a Brownie and a Manx Brownie is that the Manx Brownie resided only on the Isle of Man, preferred to wear green rather than brown, and had a distinct proclivity for having fun, but only when it knew that it would not be detrimental to its family. There have been no reported sightings of a Manx Brownie for more than two centuries, so they are believed to have gone extinct. The circumstances behind their extinction is currently unknown. Because they were a spirit-form creature, it is impossible to find and study any remains for signs or clues as to the cause of their downfall, however many magizoologists have accredited their disappearance to the rise of residential development, building over their natural habitats, and a general lack of acknowledgement to their existence.",2015-08-11 21:16:36+00:00,ctzma6z,2.0,t1_ctntwtn,898838.0,harrypotter
