Everyone's giving out suggestions. Finally the teacher pulls out a pad and reads off that 

""The average American Dream in the 1950s was to have a large house, a nice car, 2.5 kids...""

At this point I start cracking up. ""How does one happen upon half a child,"" I ask, causing a little stir of laughter. Morbid images of toddlers and a variety of power saws enters my mind.

""It's an average, people either wanted 2 kids or 3 kids,"" explained my teacher.

This made sense to me, and my laughter subsided a little, though a smile still lingered on my face.

""Anyway,"" my teacher continued, ""the American dream in the 1950s was to have a large house, a garage, 2.5 kids, a nice car, a steady income--""

I burst into obscene laughter again, and people around me started to get a little annoyed. The image I am requesting had just popped into my head. I tried to focus again, but to no avail, and I kept giggling to myself for about 5 straight minutes, to the amusement of some and the annoyance of others. I was finally asked to step outside and collect myself, which took longer than you would imagine.


Anyway, this is what I'd like done:

Using [this](https://i.imgur.com/knlz1sR.jpg) as the background, please put [this half child](https://i.imgur.com/hLd2Gqy.jpg) (taken from [this](https://i.imgur.com/ggqD99A.jpg)) onto the background in various locations: First, have the child do [this](https://i.imgur.com/4xpZOpY.gif) type of thing, and maybe at the end of the 3rd frame have him shaking slightly. Then, have him next to the other kids, in the half-circle window, on the roof, poking his head down into the frame from the top, staring out of the back window of the car, and various other places around the image. Remember, this is a creepy, slighly demonic half child thing. It should be weird. Everything I've supplied is OC made by me using Pixlr, but I can't get it to do what I want beyond what I've done here. Thanks so much, people!
