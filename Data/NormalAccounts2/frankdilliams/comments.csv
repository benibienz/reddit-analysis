If we find the median, we would line them up in ascending order which I've already done, then remove the lowest value, a, then remove the highest value, faker, then we remove the second lowest value b, then we remove the second highest value d, and we're left with the median, $5000, which is a closer indicator of the real average that isn't affected by Faker's expensive ass ",2015-12-23 03:25:55+00:00,cy8ke7d,3.0,t1_cy8a2dj,18118.0,leagueoflegends

We should wait for a mod to put their input into this but I seriously think it breaks both the subreddit and reddit's rules",2015-10-11 13:18:07+00:00,cvvrmgb,6.0,t1_cvvr9qb,1064.0,LeagueOfMeta
