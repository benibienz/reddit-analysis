* G: Lowry
* F: Tobias Harris
* UTIL : Sullinger
* UTIL: Wes Matthews

Recent transactions: Dropped PJ Tucker for Aminu, dropped Henson for Mahinmi, Dropped Dieng for WCS, Claimed RoLo off waivers for Mahinmi, Dropped RoLo for Zaza (yes I know, mistakes were made), dropped Jlin for Collison, Dropped WCS for Sullinger, Added Bazemore (thanks for Collison being in IR), Dropped Collison for JJ Reddick, Traded Noel for Melo

So...I've decided to go full on punt FG% and TO. However, my supporting team isnt giving me enough on other cats, most notably blocks and assists. Who should I try to target in terms of those? I've been trying to trade from John Wall and Giannis but the owner is inactive...(ugh), and Porzingis owner won't trade him (he'd be perfect for punting FG%)

And should any of my wire pickups be traded while they're performing?

* BEN: Zaza

Recent transactions: Dropped PJ Tucker for Aminu, dropped Henson for Mahinmi, Dropped Dieng for WCS, Claimed RoLo off waivers for Mahinmi, Dropped RoLo for Zaza (yes I know, mistakes were made), dropped Jlin for Collison, Dropped WCS for Sullinger, Added Bazemore (thanks for Terrence Jones being in IR) Traded Noel for Melo

The owner of AD is trying to get rid of him, so what would be a reasonable package for him? Offered Melo + Tobias and got turned down, should I try Klay and someone else too? Also thinking about picking back up RoLo for Wes Matthews but that should be in a diff thread haha.

Edit: The owner offered me AD + Manu for Lillard + Tobias.....dunno what to do there..

1925,"Looks like villager is gone now. However, if you do this through multiple orders and one of them goes OOS, it is possible to try to combine them and have them waive one of your shipping fees. I have two orders from them that both got shipping waived. Here's how I did it (copy-paste from the previous time):

1) Ordered 4 amiibos, with regular shipping and all. Comes out to about 15 dollars each (not bad at all)

2) Saw 2 more amiibos that I want came in stock, ordered them, and contacted them [here](https://www.amazon.es/gp/help/contact-us/general-questions.html/?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=3626&amp;creative=24822&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;skip=true&amp;tag=amz.es-21&amp;type=email) to try to combine the orders. As some of the items have gone out of stock by then, she wasn't able to do it so she instead waived the shipping on one of the orders

3) Saw 3 more amiibos that I wanted came in stock, ordered those, and like before tried to combine the orders. I specifically mentioned that I couldnt combine with the previous (now shipping-waived) order and mentioned that was what happened. The operator tried and couldn't combine to the first but could to the second. So since she couldn't combine to the first, she waived shipping on my second one as well (much to my surprise) 

4) Volia! I have 2 shipments from amazon.es that are free shipping lol


Like I said, I probably just got lucky with the second one. But the operators are really really nice, and they work late hours too so you can contact them whenever. Keep in mind that I think my case is special b/c the items went out of stock since I ordered and thus my shipping was waived. I'd expect to pay at least one shipping for all the orders you create though, which......in essence is the same as buying them all at once. But it doesn't hurt to try haha.

Hope that was clear enough :)


Also, added bonus for the order with free shipment: you can upgrade to Express shipping and the shipping fee will still be waived, so there's that :P",2015-08-22 15:34:32+00:00,cubuv6t,1.0,t3_3hym89,12340.0,amiibo

1970,"It really depends on what you ordered though. I think I got lucky with mine. Here's what happened:

1) Ordered 4 amiibos, with regular shipping and all. Comes out to about 15 dollars each (not bad at all)

2) Saw 2 more amiibos that I want came in stock, ordered them, and contacted them [here](https://www.amazon.es/gp/help/contact-us/general-questions.html/?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=3626&amp;creative=24822&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;skip=true&amp;tag=amz.es-21&amp;type=email) to try to combine the orders. As some of the items have gone out of stock by then, she wasn't able to do it so she instead waived the shipping on one of the orders

3) Saw 3 more amiibos that I wanted came in stock, ordered those, and like before tried to combine the orders. I specifically mentioned that I couldnt combine with the previous (now shipping-waived) order and mentioned that was what happened. The operator tried and couldn't combine to the first but could to the second. So since she couldn't combine to the first, she waived shipping on my second one as well (much to my surprise) 

4) Volia! I have 2 shipments from amazon.es that are free shipping lol


Like I said, I probably just got lucky with the second one. But the operators are really really nice, and they work late hours too so you can contact them whenever. Keep in mind that I think my case is special b/c the items went out of stock since I ordered and thus my shipping was waived. I'd expect to pay at least one shipping for all the orders you create though, which......in essence is the same as buying them all at once. But it doesn't hurt to try haha.

Hope that was clear enough :)


Edit: Also, added bonus for the order with free shipment: you can upgrade to Express shipping and the shipping fee will still be waived, so there's that :P",2015-08-18 03:34:50+00:00,cu6ojg5,3.0,t1_cu6o9wk,523.0,amiibo
