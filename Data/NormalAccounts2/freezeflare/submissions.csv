I'm back again today as the owners just accepted another trade, this time the following:

A sends James Harden, Hassan Whiteside to B

B sends Blake Griffin, Andre Iguodala to A

Now, last time I once again told my friend who knew these guys to warn them not to do anything like this again, but here we are. Should I publically call them out on it this time, like many of you suggested? Or is this not vetoable at all.

    B traded Deron Williams, Dal PG to A
    B traded Tim Duncan, SA PF to A
    B traded Andre Iguodala, GS SF to A

2nd:

    A traded James Harden
    B Traded Deron Williams

3rd:

    A traded Hassan Whiteside
    B traded Tim Duncan

The first 2 trades were vetoed for obvious reasons. Now I am usually against vetoing trades but the 3rd trade comes along, it's closer but Duncan is putting up nowhere near the value of Whiteside this year. How would you guys deal with this?

I have a question regarding orders to Grooves Inc. So I ordered Fox and Lucario from them about 3 days ago now, did get my order receipt and everything. However, on the site itself it's still in ""order placed"" and it says to look for shipping estimates on the product page themselves, which I cannot find. Anybody who had ordered from them know if the ""order placed"" is usual and only changes when it ships? And how long does it usually take? Thanks!

Edit: Should also mention I paid through PayPal and it was charged already",amiibo,Grooves Inc Order Question,http://www.reddit.com/r/amiibo/comments/3dii7q/grooves_inc_order_question/
