8,"The AK-47 refers to the first-generation pattern of AK's. They are quite valuable and few were made (relatively speaking) as they were machined manually. Eventually, design quirks were worked out of the final design and the AKM entered mass-production in 1956. This variant of the AK pattern utilized stamped sheet metal in it's overall construction, allowing for cheap production. In 1974, the AK-74(M) was brought into service. Chambered in the 5.45x39mm cartridge, it offered accuracy and reduced muzzle climb comparable of that to the M16 rifle.",2016-11-08 22:21:39+00:00,d9rqvoi,1,t3_5bsxh9,35310,AskReddit
