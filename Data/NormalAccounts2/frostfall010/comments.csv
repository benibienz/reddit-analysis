1,"I think it depends on how much you want to spend in the end. If you're looking for more low-key then I'd suggest a nice restaurant (California Grill, Citricos, Flying Fish, Jiko, The Boathouse), maybe some fun bars (Trader Sam's, Hangar Bar), and make sure to get the ""just married"" pins someone else mentioned!

Alternatively, you can do a tour together since WDW has a bunch of well-rated park tours. Some of the resort spas offer couples massages, too.

6,"First, I think the wedding situation is still totally up in the air. You've said nothing's official yet. It's awkward to tell someone who just assumes their participation is desired that it actually isn't, but I think it might be easier for you and your partner to do so once you've moved out. Keep it up in the air for now. (Personally, I absolutely wouldn't want him there if his ultimatum is ""best man or nothing"". Fine, nothing then!)

For another perspective, we used to have a spare room in an apartment we lived in so we hosted on AirBnB. Guests were, for the most part, fine. But since we're in a larger city we would get people staying with us for month-long stretches (sometimes longer). We had one guy who was most likely on the spectrum--and I don't say that negatively, but it just affected the interactions with him in a big way--and extremely hard to deal with. He would only ever make complaints to my fiance when no one else was in the apartment and had the most bizarre expectations about things (e.g., wouldn't use a plunger b/c it was ""dirty"" regardless of being told that the toilet was older and required you to hold down the lever to flush it completely. His solution: go outside, get a stick, break up the clog, flush again and again, leave stick in the trash can.) We'd be direct on certain things or issue and he wouldn't listen or would just disregard us. We had him there for about 2+ months. It was horrible and incredibly stressful. What I'm saying is, I totally get how you feel to some extent, without the added aspect of actually being friends with the person.

In the end, we waited it out and popped open a bottle of champagne the day he left. A lot of the stuff you list are things that, ultimately, won't be an issue once you're outta there in a month and a half. I wouldn't bother telling him any of that little stuff and would focus more on the wedding and how that's going to end up with him (whether or not you want him included). 

Take deep breaths, stay out of the apartment if you can, and just countdown the days.",2016-11-03 16:23:16+00:00,d9k4yy4,1.0,t3_5awua4,8741.0,relationships
7,"A lot of great info down below. I try to keep a spreadsheet going to keep track of all options. The official WDW site sometimes has deals going on but we've found that the cheapest option for us in the end is usually booking room, ticket, and flights all separate.

We've used Undercover Tourist for the rooms. Parksavers for the tickets (these are the cheapest I've found online). If you have AAA, consider talking to them about discounted tickets. Flights we book one-way tickets as that sometimes is cheaper than doing a round-trip flight. Price out of the flights both ways to see what's best.

If you're hoping to avoid a car, then I'd suggest (like others have) staying on property. You can't beat their transportation system. Since you're looking to do cheap, look into the All Star resorts or Pop Century. I imagine you'll want to spend a lot of time at the parks so your room shouldn't matter too much (although the rooms at both resorts are nice!).

And as someone's said, if you're looking to do 2016 I think you're going to end up paying more for flights just because it's so close now. If there's any flexibility at all, consider January/February. Crowds aren't as bad and it's somewhat cheaper.

14,"If you think that it's worth mentioning, you can do it in a subtle but thoughtful way. I did an MA and went right into a post-bacc pre-med program after graduating. I didn't do well that first semester and really needed to re-evaluate my priorities. Still, my MPH program would have to see those poor grades. So I wrote into the personal statement how I was burned out, how that affected my academic performance, and that I ended up using that decision as an opportunity to explore my academic options (this is all paraphrased, of course). Knowing that a poor grade in stats wouldn't go unnoticed, I wanted to address that part of my academic career. I got into the program and I don't regret having addressed it. So it definitely can't hurt to explain why your GPA is lower than you would have liked, just do it in a way that doesn't come off as making excuses.

37,"Man and I thought our little drama was a handful! There's something about weddings where people seem to feel entitled to contribute their opinions left and right and with some parents especially, that they can dictate the choices you make. It sounds like you've really tried to bend and give them gentle, ""sure I'll think about it"" kind of answers. I realize this is a vent but just my $.02--I'd be firm with them from here on out. No, we didn't want a regular registry but have set a small one up for those who want to purchase gifts. I don't want to talk about this anymore. Yes, you're paying for the wedding, but if that meant it's going to be all your decisions and a guilt trip every time I make one of my own, then please rescind the GD offer and let me do it my way.

I caught some shit from my mom regarding our guest list where she was really against me inviting one uncle. She came off (through text messages) as mean, rude, and smarmy (along the lines of: This is gonna blow up in your face, but I warned you...). After talking to my sister who's younger than I am and still lives at home, she told me that after discussing it, my mom didn't realize she was being so aggressive and felt bad. Still, to me it was manipulative and frankly, none of her goddamn business as it's my decision, along with my fiance. So, it's possible your family members on some level don't realize they're being as manipulative as they are. Regardless, see if you and you FH can come as a united front at both of them and tell them it's your wedding and your wishes should be respected. Your decisions shouldn't be second-guessed constantly. And believe me, I get the overly sensitive thing big time.

If your profession is more specialized, it could be that the work community surrounding the profession is small and that others are aware of his general demeanor. To be honest, it doesn't sound like he would take being spoken to by a superior at your behest very well. This is not a reason to avoid doing so, but if you're just beginning a career it may be best to take your lumps until more serious issues arise (if they do at all) while looking for alternative apprenticeships (if that's a possibility). You are in a tough position because of your age but that doesn't mean you can't level a legitimate complaint against a superior with the proper people.

From your descriptions, he just sounds like a bad boss who's lazy and takes advantage of his position.

Then maybe ask him how he thinks you two should proceed (talk to mom first? have him sit down with his dad in a non-confrontational way?). It's totally inappropriate for your FIL to do that and you shouldn't have to avoid conversations with him forever because he can't respect you. If your relationship and communication with him is as open as you say it is he should be willing to listen.

If you have time on Friday, you could plan for the Magic Kingdom at night (which is a great intro to your trip). Epcot on Saturday morning, Disney Studios Sat night, Magic Kingdom Sunday morning, Epcot Sunday night, and whatever park was your favorite on Monday morning before leaving. Just my thoughts!

I'd try to make dinner reservations if I were you. Those, as well as your FastPasses which are also made online, would be determined by what parks you're going to and when. I only suggest planning this stuff out ahead of time because if you don't you might not be able to get a table somewhere (if a sit down meal is what you both want) and you could end up waiting all day for rides without getting on a ton. All this is done through My Disney Experience online--but this also relies on you having valid park admission.

111,"- Sign up for disboards.com. There are tons of people on there who can answer every question, and most likely, every question you'll have will have been already asked (and answered).

- You have 7 1/2 months to get prepared so take a breather, you definitely have time. Jot down the 180 day mark, and 60 day mark which are the number of days out from your reservation date that you can make dinner reservations (also called advanced dining reservations [ADRs]) and FastPass+ bookings, respectively. **This is if you book to stay on Disney property for your hotel.

- Definitely stay on property as having access to the buses is a great perk, in addition to extra magic hours which get you into the parks early or allow you to stay late on certain days of the week.

- Don't try to do it all because you won't be able to. Pick a handful of must-dos and make them happen.

- Take a break in the middle of your day to relax.

- Plan as much as you can beforehand (dining reservations, FP+, what park you'll go to on what day, etc.). This will definitely help your trip run as smoothly as possible.

It's definitely overwhelming. I've known people who go without any planning, come back and say it was awful and that they won't go again. You already know you have to plan so that's great. Your kids are a good age to appreciate everything so I think you'll all have a blast. I think the biggest thing is to just plan as much as you can, understand you won't do and see it all, and relax while there since you already did the work beforehand.

I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have. Good luck with everything!

It was a little bit pricier, but I made a spreadsheet to compare and I don't think what we did was any more expensive than going through the Disney site for just a full stay at the Coronado.

We also booked tickets and rooms separately. We booked the rooms through Undercover Tourist which gave a discount on the rooms so that helped a lot. Same with the tickets, which I think we got on Parksavers.com or something like that. Good luck!",2016-04-22 20:04:51+00:00,d2dhiuy,1.0,t3_4fz3l6,14529.0,WaltDisneyWorld

126,"I've seen a few proposals at CG and they usually always garner attention. I don't think they do the glass slipper thing there, but I've seen special desserts and champagne. If you still want to do it there, they have a back room that is more private. You could do your proposal there quietly and time it so you can watch the fireworks on the viewing deck afterwords. Otherwise, I think you're going to draw attention and if that's what she isn't into you might want to think about another option.

I imagine Soarin' will be open but I'm not sure if there's a guaranteed opening date. If worse comes to worse and you don't get a FP, get there before rope drop and head to Soarin' first thing.

Magic Maker, I think, is for the length of your stay as it's a flat price. I could be wrong on this though.

In terms of doing special things in the park: 

- You can get ""Just engaged"" buttons at Guest Services
- I think you can let the host/hostess know at restaurants in case you want to take the route. Sneak away to ""go to the bathroom"" and talk to them then.
- Special mouse ears?

Also, you can have flowers set up to be delivered to your room the night of the proposal so that they're there AFTER you get back from dinner. If you talk to Disney Florists I think they can work with you to get something nice put together and make sure it's there when you want it to be there. Might be around $100-$150 but it's cheaper than the $400 glass slipper. And if she wants something more low key this might suit her better.

Whatever you choose, good luck!

Edit: I've also seen the glass slipper at Cinderella's Royal Table and that gets toooons of attention so that might not work either. Just FYI.",2016-04-12 16:17:53+00:00,d1zyb73,1.0,t3_4eec5t,46526.0,WaltDisneyWorld

I once sat through Illuminations at Nine Dragons in China. The food is always good there--nothing crazy different from what you'd see at your local Chinese place--but it was a cool experience. You can always head out through the International Gateway and check out a restaurant at the Boardwalk or Beach Club and then return for fireworks.",2016-04-11 18:59:46+00:00,d1ysn7j,1.0,t3_4ebhrk,8683.0,WaltDisneyWorld

- California Grill at the Contemporary

- Jiko at the Animal Kingdom Lodge

- Flying Fish Cafe at the Boardwalk (it's being renovated now, I think, but may be open by the time you visit)

- Wave of American Flavors at the Contemporary: this one's cool, I wasn't crazy about the space itself, but the food was good

133,"- Has anyone else run into similar problems booking hot seats for tables that haven't even gone to the general public yet?

Yes. I try to just keep on it. Someone is bound to drop their ADR and at a time when you're looking. That's usually how I get CA Grill reservations. Just keep on it.

- Is this maybe an October only issue due to the likelyhood they'll offer free Disney dining? The second they announce the free dining plan, it always seems like ADRs book solid, even at places that usually always have space.

It could be. Depending on when you're going it could be getting closer to the Not So Scary party they throw each year, which impacts availability.

- What ways could Disney improve the ADR process? My wife suggested limiting the number of ADRs you can make, but I'm fairly certain they already do that to some degree.

It's a good question. I'm not really sure. It hasn't always been like this, so maybe it's just more people are visiting? Or they're deliberately closing off reservation space?

- Is it even worth while to book T-180+d when you can't do FP+ until T-60d and they wont announce show times/fireworks times/Magic Hours until T-30d?

I would say yes. That way you at least have them and can book your FP+ around it as much as possible. And with the flexibility coming to the FP+ system it might be a little easier.

Good luck! I'm sure you'll get the majority of the ADRs you need.

140,"A meal is a good idea, but be aware that a meal for two at the CA Grill, if you want to do appetizers, entrees, desserts, and drinks (if they drink) could push your $200 limit. There are definitely other places to look into that are great as well, so definitely look into that.

I like the idea someone had below of a picture frame with a picture. But since you want to do something beforehand, flowers are an option as you've stated. I've done that before for my parents who paid for part of a trip I went on with them and my girlfriend. It was a flower arrangement, balloon, and mug they got to take home.

Another option is to come up with a trip ""goodie bag"" beforehand. Gather items you think they'd like and use during the trip: small souvenirs, treats, you could look into getting them both fun designed [MagicBands](http://www.disneystore.com/magicband/mn/1024701/) (they're around $25 each), disposable cameras, a gift card that you could say is specifically for them to use for a treat for themselves (a dessert somewhere, wine to bring home, etc.). Resorts are generally really good about working with you on stuff like this, so with enough forewarning, you could conceivably put a fun, decorated box like this together, ship it to the resort, and call them directly with reservation info asking that the box be put in the room beforehand or have it delivered after you all check in (they might even be able to give it to your parents when they check in at the front desk?). This way you're giving them a surprise and a series of smaller gifts they can use during the trip and you get more for the money you plan to spend.",2016-04-05 15:07:57+00:00,d1qr1fn,1.0,t3_4dgjgp,3961.0,WaltDisneyWorld
141,"Here are mine!

- Don't try to do everything. Expect to miss things but DO take note of stuff you want to see on your next go around. It's a huge huge huge place and I've been stressed in the past sometimes because it felt as though I was missing out on things. I was. But I went back a few years later and made sure to visit those attractions. 
- Don't get to parks any later than a half hour after rope drop.
- Don't expect to wait for a table at restaurants--book in advance and save yourself the headache.
- Don't ignore the FP+ system and end up waiting in line for hours.
- Don't expect this to be a normal vacation where you just do pick what you want to do that day and just do it. WDW vacations take planning and work but it will make the trip itself so much smoother, enjoyable, and relaxing. Do your research and plan ahead. It really ends up being a ton of fun.
- Don't forget that everyone else there is thinking exactly what you are: ""I paid $X,XXXs of dollars for this vacation and I'm going to do what I want."" I've seen this mindset ruin the experience for others and myself (like taking tons of flash pictures in the Haunted Mansion just so someone has ""memories"" of the ride).
- If you're going in the summer, don't forget to drink a ton of water. Ask for it from counter service restaurants (it's free), use fountains, or bring your own.
- Don't forget to be aware of yourself and your surroundings. WDW is a crowded hectic place and remembering to step aside to answer a text or check a map could help you avoid being run into by people rushing to get to their next FP or dinner reservation.
- Don't wear flip flops all of the time while there. They're OK sometimes, but ultimately a good pair of running or walking sneakers that are breathable (not leather or suede) end up being the best.
- Finally, don't forget to take a breather every day for you and your family. The trip will be fun but may end up being hectic because you're rushing to this or that. Make sure to schedule a little down time: a mid-day break at the pool after getting to a park early for rope drop, taking a break on a park bench with ice cream, or even getting on a ride that might be calm and relaxing (Living with the Land, Ellen's Energy Adventure, Hall of Presidents, Carousel of Progress, WED People Mover, etc.).",2016-04-05 14:52:03+00:00,d1qqcp2,1.0,t3_4dge90,5145.0,WaltDisneyWorld
142,"I think there are a few reasons:

1. Like others have said, he was most likely trying to delay Voldemort.
2. Isn't there a line in there where Voldemort says something like, ""You do not seek to kill me""? I've always imagined the magic Dumbledore was throwing around was something deeper and more horrible than typical spells--in this instance, I assumed Dumbledore was trying to ""disable"" Voldemort's magic. Kind of like the anti-apparition jinx he uses but way stronger and more encompassing. At one point, Harry hears a noise like a gong and the hair on his neck stands up. It felt to me like this was an attack that got more at Voldemort's magic itself than just his person.
3. The wand is incredibly powerful, made more so by the fact that those who win in have incredibly prodigious skill. It doesn't guarantee victory 100% of the time though. Technically, Voldemort could have won it from Dumbledore in this duel.
4. He's older now. Voldemort was around...85 or so at the time? We could consider that to be at the height of his prime as a wizard. Whereas Dumbledore, while probably more knowledgeable about magic in many cases and with time on his side to foster his skill, is older and probably isn't as fast in comparison to Voldemort as he might as once been.",2016-04-04 14:20:22+00:00,d1pc578,1.0,t3_4dajq6,12627.0,harrypotter

147,"I hear what you're saying. On the other hand, I think we all end up thinking this whenever Disney introduces something new to pay for, or a price hike. That's not to excuse the company from jacking prices on things that were previously free, but from the sound of it, we're all still going in one way or another (AP holder, staying off-site, cheap on-site, saving every penny, etc.). One user said it correctly, IMO, down below: Universal is more of a theme park whereas Disney is an experience. Ultimately, it comes down to what you are personally willing to pay for or not pay for, what you're OK missing out on (like firework FP+), and if that experience, versus just ""another visit to a theme park"" is worth it.

That being said, there are definitely valid points being made that Disney is being geared more towards those who can easily afford it. I can see that being the case but I don't think it will ever just be for just the wealthy. The odd thing I've found about Disney vacations is that the experience transcends the actual property. If you ever visit the Disboards, or even if you're on this subreddit, you can see people that focus on Disney for entire years while they scrimp and save, watch movies, do Disney themed parties and holidays. What Disney realizes is that they have that cultural cache and clout to keep people, wealthy and not so wealthy, coming through the gates. Now if that's a good or a bad thing, idk. I do know that I'll keep going as long as I can though.

Hopefully, as an AP, you can still indulge in that experience and not have it tainted too much by these changes.",2016-03-24 14:47:57+00:00,d1bsv38,1.0,t3_4brar3,9224.0,WaltDisneyWorld
