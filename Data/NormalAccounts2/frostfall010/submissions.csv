We'd been discussing doing a stint overseas if possible for a year or so now. I've been keeping an eye out for jobs abroad off and on just to see what's out there. I'm currently working a medical school in administration dealing primarily with the financial aspects of the school. I'm also working on my Masters of Public Health in epidemiology and biostatistics which I hope to finish by Dec. 2018. I already have an MA in sociocultural anthropology (focus on medical anth.). 

Given this, I was planning on leveraging my MPH and stats skills, in addition to my qualitative background, to look for work internationally. The countries I listed are the primary choices but given the difficulty of securing an overseas position we are not hellbent on those in particular.

Are there companies I should be looking at in particular? Or just specific job sectors that might provide an in to one of these countries? As we have about 2 years to go I thought that this would be a good time to get the ball rolling. I appreciate any and all advice.

I work at a university and have the option to take classes for free here. I applied to a Master's program and got in, so I've been taking classes since the spring (2 in total so far, 2 coming up in the fall) to fulfill my credit requirements.

The caveat to the tuition remission benefit is that if your total tuition amount goes over $5,250 you are responsible for the state taxes associated with the difference. The difference for this year is $12,438, which broken down into the remaining pay periods for the calendar year (18--one paycheck per week) is $691/pay period. 

I was just informed yesterday that the amount of $691 will be added to my taxable income per pay until the end the calendar year to satisfy this requirement. They ""estimate this could be 30% of additional taxable income"". This means that 30% of the $691 ($207) will be deducted from my paycheck each week in addition to my existing tax deductions starting a week from this Friday. That will mean I get $828 less each month which is, basically, not realistic.

I can't drop my upcoming classes because I have to maintain at least a part-time status in the program so that's not an option. I may end up having to borrow money from my parents to just stay afloat while looking for a part-time job to work on the weekends. This year has been big financially and I have my wedding coming up in November so it's particularly tight.

My questions are: Will I see any of the money I paid based on the ""estimated"" 30% back if the % is lower? Conversely, could I end up owing more? I don't know if anyone would know, but is this typically how taxes are collected in situations like this from employees? Do I have any recourse to push back on this to perhaps get a lump sum bill at the end of the calendar year rather than having my wages garnished?

Although I knew about the taxation on tuition amounts over $5,250 (and I should've asked for specifics earlier on) this is the first notice I've gotten concerning this. It's probably just shitty organization on the part of the university but I feel as though I should have had a bit more notice that my paychecks through December would be reduced by ~$200.

I appreciate any thoughts or help.

tl;dr Taking classes free through job, tuition is taxed over certain amount. Just found out yesterday that university will take $200 out of each of my paychecks to cover this cost by the end of the calendar year.",personalfinance,Taxes on tuition remission classes,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4z82gw/taxes_on_tuition_remission_classes/

We were happy with them. So, we ordered our invitations, info cards, etc,. from them. Loved the design, proofs looked great. Only thing is, the proofs showed a light cream background on the face of the invite(with a darker, more mocha-y color on the back). It went well with the color scheme and fit the vintage look we had going. Well, we received them last Friday and the face of the invite is pretty much white. You could maybe say off-white, but it's basically white.

I realize that sometimes colors don't translate that well through a PDF but when it comes to wedding invites I'd hope and expect them to be at least 98% accurate. We didn't break the bank buying them but want to write to the seller to convey our disappointment. Is it even worth the effort at this point? Should I ask for a re-do with a discount or something? It'll come down to our word against hers I suppose and I'm not looking for this to be a big issue.

The seller definitely has color stock more similar to the proofs' colors because we received samples of their other work when we got the save the dates. So it would be possible to reprint.

She works in a department with 4 other women (boss included). One of these women is in her mid-40s and deals with a number of mental health issues. She's very open about it and we know she has been seeing two separate therapists for over 10 years (one who can prescribe meds, one who can't). She's a nice person but is a non-stop talker. Their office setup is a ""pod"" so the talker and another colleague to her left face reception and my fiance, with a distance of maybe 15-18ft between them. This makes it unavoidable to ignore her. Some things she says/does: 

- Dictates what she's typing as she's typing it
- Announcing each and every time she's getting tea
- (While it's silent in the space) loudly: ""What?! What. This can't be right."" Turns out she's reading her email and saw something that upset her. Many variations on this all related to things like finding a kitten video or reading the news.
- She will call other colleagues and chit chat for 45 minutes; will call for personal matters (her parents, arranging dr's appts, etc.) and do the same.
- Will butt in constantly should someone else come to ask either my fiance or one of her colleagues a question and will talk to (or at) them for at least 5-10 minutes before letting them ask what they came for in the first place.

The list goes on. She's a nice person, but it's non-stop. Her boss, who the talker has worked with for around a decade plus, has spoken to her many times and nothing changes. My fiance, while she considers the talker a stronger work acquaintance than others, has been direct with her to the point of sounding rude. You have to talk over her talking over you to get her to stop. My fiance's other co-worker has noise-cancelling headphones she uses often and while I've suggested the same to my fiance, she's not a fan of wearing headphones all day long which I understand (also, it shouldn't be necessary).

How do you deal with someone like her? She's very set in her ways and this is the job she's going to have through the rest of her career. She has a kind heart but she has legitimate issues understanding her presence among colleagues day in and day out. It feels like at this point it's a ""deal with it until you leave"" situation, but it makes the daily work experience stressful and tense because it's difficult to work through constant inane chatter. 

I'd really appreciate any input or advice.

We always knew to expect unwanted input and opinions. People have told us, respond with ""Thanks, we'll think about it!"" and just sort of let it lie. Well, we're at the guest list stage and I'm getting more than an unasked for earful from my mom about a particular uncle who is, generally, an asshole. He's my dad's brother. I thought a lot about not inviting him, talked to my fiance, my mom gave me all sort of opinions (of which she has plenty), and finally decided, I'll lay my arguments out for my dad, saying that I don't really want to invite this uncle because he's antagonistic, likes to be the center of attention, is an ass to my dad, etc. But, if my dad really pushes, then I'll invite him. (Disclosure, I'm inviting his sister as we have a close relationship but if I didn't invite this particular a-hole brother, my dad's other brother might have been left out as well because a-hole and him are really close--not the best situation.) Well he pushed back so I invited him. People have said if he ends up making some spectacle of himself (which he has for his children's weddings, but nothing drunk or anything like that) they'll tell him to leave, which I and my fiance are 100% behind.

So, I made the decision and am resting with it. He can make his little immature comments throughout the day, but I won't see him that much and my family can deftly handle any potential douchiness he puts out there. Honestly, I don't expect him to be that bad but he's just an unpleasant person I've never liked much and my dad wanted to have him there so I'm OK with swallowing that.

Now my mom is flat out telling me he's essentially going to ruin the wedding... text, after many others of the same nature,: ""this will backfire. but you asked for it."" I can't even think of a response so I just didn't. She's more or less acting like I made this biggest mistake for this wedding and now the whole thing's doomed. And she isn't the first to throw in her opinions into the ring on larger issues that are, ultimately, our decision.

I guess this is part vent/part outreach for advice. How have you all dealt with this kind of thing? Being politely ambiguous about someone's suggestion for a decoration is one thing. This feels harder to handle.

It was a bit of a spur of the moment decision admittedly, but we had a dinner reservation at the California Grill for 8:45. So we ate, watched Wishes from the restaurant, then headed over to the MK.

- Tomorrowland Speedway
- Pirates
- Big Thunder Mtn RR
- Jungle Cruise
- Aladdin
- Space Mountain 2x (walked on both times)
- Ariel
- 7 Dwarfs Mine Cart 3x (didn't wait any longer than 5 minutes and road the back two times and the front once)

Included free ice cream from the carts and any soda/water you want, also from the carts. I think, and I'd double check this, that it also includes park admission for the day which is helpful to know.
