9,"I always downvote bertstrips. They're just bad. They don't do much besides bring a general cynicism and malaise into the universe that doesn't need to be in my life. I learned to read thanks to Sesame Street, and I loved Bert and Ernie. Their influence on me was strong and positive in my younger years, and these memes are such an awful twist on them. Moreover, I want to set a good example to my peers as well as the youth with positive vibes, and seeing all this negativity makes it take so much more effort. Seeing how popular these are hurts me, knowing that so many people empathize enough that the despair and sarcasm is widely indulged, increasing the power and breadth of its message.
I upvoted this one. It helped me realize that sincerity is often hidden behind cynicism. These days I am struggling to enjoy life, and my ambitions to accomplish greatness are all but gone. But I am determined. I will have a nice house and a comfy job if I have anything to say about it. And I'm going to do my very best to contribute to society. And if I find myself forced to choose whether to squish an ant, I'll have to decide in the moment how much it matters either way, and the ant will be at the mercy of my whim, as I am at the mercy of this strange world.

Want to know who I think I am? I think I'm a person who brings more beauty into the real world than you. I put effort into picking up other peoples' litter, wiping away my messy roommate's scum, and organizing the giant pile of crap in my church's garage because other people don't care enough to do it at all. You think your college education is best used to ""roll around in cynical memes?"" Shame. Bring it up, buddy. Pull yourself together.
I'm not ridiculing you at all. I'm questioning the core of your motivations. Sure, you have a dark side. Me too. Everybody does. And it is beautiful and tragic, truly. It even made you get all defensive and write 400 words on a furious spree about how you want to harm a stranger on the other side of the internet. You know what happens when you indulge your dark side? It grows, and it gives you more words and thoughts in your very own life that are words of anger and despair. You are hurting me, you are hurting yourself, and you are hurting the whole goddamn universe by WASTING YOUR FUCKING TIME ON THIS BITTER FILTH HOW CAN YOU EVEN JUSTIFY IT? WHY IS IT OKAY?
Perhaps you have adopted an ideology that won't die. Maybe bertstrips will outlive me. Probably. I hope and pray I can serve existence well enough that my influence brings more inspiration than this crap. I won't tolerate it. I'm not telling you how to live your life, but we just might be mortal enemies.",2016-11-20 02:00:49+00:00,da7ojxq,1.0,t3_5dswwp,37854.0,bertstrips

For example, for me to get to UCI from Tustin it takes 15 minutes by car. 30 minutes back with traffic. There is a route with one transfer that is pretty direct to UCI. How long does it take? A fucking hour and a half. That's why people don't take the bus. There are so many fucking stops that it makes medium to long-distance travel unbearable.

I also think Silverado is a really cute little town since it feels so completely different and hidden from the rest of Orange County. Cooks Corner is a huge biker joint in the area that you should stop by.

The Land to Sea bike route is a great trip as well. It takes you through Back Bay which is really beautiful. 

The Balboa Peninsula and Island is an old classic beach town and you can walk around most of it. Take the ferry ($2 I think) and get lunch at Ruby's on the pier.

San Juan Capistrano's old town is quaint and small enough to walk around. The mission is right there as well. Also because the metrolink station is smack dab in the middle you can avoid the long drive by parking at a station further north and taking the train down. If you are a student and also go on the weekend then you can get discounts on tickets. I'm not sure how much the mission costs.

395,"If your friend got full tuition then that equals about $14k, which might make more sense if her family's income is in the $60-80k range (because that's roughly my situation too). $27k seems like a lot so I think you did everything correctly. Keep I mind too that UCIs estimate for your expenses, in my opinion, is kind of high.

$7k a year in loans isn't a small amount, but x4 years is $28k which is definitely a manageable amount if you will end up with a decent job after college. Also get a job year round. You can pull in maybe $5k a year which will do wonders to pay down that debt, especially with the min wage going up (assuming you don't have to spend it on other things). 

Another option is community college for two years (which is tuition free at lower incomes with the board of governors fee waiver). If you're feeling a bit lost and worried that the debt will be too stressful while you're figuring out what you want from college, then this is a decent option.

636,"I know plenty of those people, however I would definitely not say they are the norm, even among white people (and I grew up near a wealthy white area). I also grew up with plenty of Hispanic/Latino and Asian friends and peers who went to the exact same schools (even if they came from poorer areas) as me and in many cases to even better colleges. Even the fraction of Black people I know came from the middle class and got admitted into some of the best universities in my state. So many of them come from wealth that is similar to mine, and a location where even the poor areas are above average in terms of wealth and safety.

I think it's pretty exaggerated to say that most people have the cards stacked against them. I think the hyperbole is what turns people off, although I do agree that racial disparities and the lack of upward mobility in many cases is an issue that a lot of people refuse to recognize.

But the part that is down right infuriating is the people (there are many) who insinuate that the lives of white people are easy at a minimum. When middle class college students tell me that their lives - despite coming from the middle class, despite going to a university, despite receiving copious amounts of financial aid- tell me that their lives are significantly more difficult that mine because they are a minority. They assume that my life is just great based off of my skin color. And yet I cannot complain about them because as a white person racism against me apparently does not exist (so say the intro to sociology textbooks). There is a racist rhetoric that has entrenched itself into the social justice movement and for that reason I cannot and will not get behind it.",2015-07-01 04:27:33+00:00,csod4zj,9.0,t1_csncx2m,70831.0,funny
