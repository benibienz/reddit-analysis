I'm actually about to go study abroad. My depression from high school came back sophomore year and since then I've had super low motivation such that I can hardly do homework. Anything that doesn't come naturally gets ignored because of the steps it causes me. My grades are getting fucked too. I'm questioning whether I should still go abroad and if it would be better to just take a semester off.

I don't have many close friends either. I don't have the motivation to go out and make them or work on relationships. The closest person I have really is my ex, who I honestly still love but who has trouble knowing how to comfort people. 

But the thing that I always think about is that my dream is to just leave college and work some standard job that doesn't require a ton of thinking like college does (and like I'm sure whatever job I get with my degree will as well). I just want to drop out and leave all of this stress. I know I'm capable of more but because of depression I feel like it's not an option any more.

Last month the receptionist was having everyone pee into a cup for mandatory testing. She assured me that it was to determine whether or not everyone was taking their medications. I didn't think much of it because it sounded pretty sensible and standard, although in my 2-3 years of being a psychiatric patient I had never been required to do this.

Skip to the end of August, I get an explanation of benefits from my insurance (I'm 20 and under my Dad's plan) for the day that I had the urine test. Apparently the company that did it was not in network, so I was left to pay 50% of the bill. Here's the thing. The bill was $2,200. They did roughly 24 different tests. Being suspicious, I googled the name of the testing company. I could not find a single website for it other than some contact info on various ""yellow books"" type websites. There were some results showing this lab as being in Oregon, so I searched the lab's name on the Oregon Secretary of State's site. Every single person registered with the company on the SOS database is the exact same person. And every single location (including the primary place of business) is a 2 story house in a suburb in Southern Oregon, in a completely different area from the one that my search results showed. In addition, the date that the lab (an LLC) was formed was last December in 2014. At this point I'm almost completely sure that I'm being screwed by both my psychiatrist and this lab.

At this time my mom also calls them to ask why they ran out-of-network tests without asking us. They claim that they can't help with the billing, but they gave her a number of some guy (let's call him John Johnson) who apparently is their contact at the testing lab. According to them, John usually is able to resolve the issues. We call the number twice and leave a voicemail at what sounds like someone's house (the answering machine said ""Hi you've reached the 'Johnson's etc etc etc"").

All of this happened in between appointments. I just had one today, so I asked for a printout of all of the tests that were run and what the results were. The heading on the printout confirmed that the address which I found searching for online was for the right company (not the address from the SOS, but from google searches). I pressed them again on the fact that it was out of network and kind of ridiculous to run all of these tests (they ran a ""pain panel"" that tested for 24 different narcotics, opioids, benzodiazepines, cyclic antidepressants, and more) since I only take one medication and it's an SSRI. They played dumb and directed me again to John Johnson, but gave me a different number this time. However, they told me that he will be able to waive my portion of the bill since the insurance already paid their's, however they needed to include it in the bill anyway because otherwise the insurance would think it is fraud. Is that not a damning statement? What do you guys think? What can I do? I already left a message at my insurance's fraud hotline last week, but not response yet. Thanks for any help.

EDIT: I just called a different number that was under the name of the lab on my test result printouts. It's a separate company. I contacted them and actually got to their billing department. They said that the lab's policy is to waive charges that are sent to the patient in excess of what is paid by the insurance. 

Given the seemingly ridiculous amount of tests that were run on me, does this constitute insurance fraud?

I mainly just need something relatively ergonomic for a palm grip and with space for my ring and pinky fingers.
I've tried out the Rival at BestBuy and I thought that the ""butt"" of the mouse was too far back, such that I had to move my hand further back from the front of the mouse to properly palm it (my hands are about 7.5 inches from wrist to the top of my middle finger). If I palmed the mouse as I normally would, my ring and pinky fingers squish up on the other side of the butt and end up cramping, rather than resting on the actual protrusion.

So with that said, the EC1-A has a similar protrusion to that of the Rival, but is it true that it is placed more on the side? i.e. closer to the front of the mouse than it is on the Rival? I can't tell if it is just because of how the picture looks or if it is indeed further up, and tbh this is the last consideration I have before I decide between the G502 or the EC1-A.
