I don't know if you know, but we here in Alberta have been dealing with a huge out of control wildfire. As I'm writing this, it's an estimated 241, 457 hectares (or 932.3 square miles for you 'mericans). The wildfire triggered the mandatory evacuation of 5 communities, the biggest one being in Fort McMurray, which has about 80,000 residents. Most evacuees were directed south, down to Edmonton and Calgary, some were directed north, and others were directed east, into Saskatchewan.

So, basically, I'm asking for help. I've compiled a list of charities that are looking for money. http://yolo420.com/firesevacueehelp",2016-05-14 08:55:04+00:00,d3530ei,1.0,t3_4ivxgl,229764.0,DiamondClub

9,"I'm going to assume you mean HA 295B: Introduction to Film Studies, since the history in cinema course is a different number.

Film Studies is like English classes except instead of reading, you watch movies. So with HA 295B being an intro course, they'll teach you things to look for when analysing films. If you don't have any issues writing papers where you analyse the film like you would a book in English class, then you should do ok in it. You'll also have to do research for the papers. Also, your listening skills need to be good enough to watch movies without subtitles (unless the film is in a language other than English). I mean, you could watch the movie again on your own time with the subtitles, but that's alot of time that could be used for other things. It also includes a tutorial, and you'll need to participate in those. The tutorials are just discussions. So this class will require you to use all 4 English skills (reading, writing, speaking and listening). I don't know your ability level for these skills, so I can't really tell you how hard it will be for you. But I hope the above info will help you.

(if you meant HA 367: History in Cinema, then I don't know. I didn't take that course when I was doing my minor.)",2015-12-11 10:51:49+00:00,cxv7mlb,2.0,t1_cxuwi3t,28925.0,uvic
