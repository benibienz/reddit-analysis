3,"To expand on that theory, maybe the zombies are consumers (kpop fans/whatever audience listening to kpop) who mindlessly consume what the kpop industry churns out (could be a criticism that it's much of the same). At first we might think TWICE is ""just another girl"" group for us to mindlessly devour, but by the end scene, we/the zombies truly, genuinely fall for the girls who make our hearts beat (again?/I mean their success is kind of like SNSD-JYP version so zombies turning back into humans could represent people remembering why they fell in love with kpop again thanks to TWICE). They're outstanding–and their arrival makes people wake up from monotony because we actually, actively care about and want to look out for them.

And since we're talking about zombies eating people anyway... it's like the difference between eating a familiar junk food all the time just because you're bored versus discovering and appreciating a wonderful new meal that will be your new favorite.

lol idk my bad if that was a bit messy. I haven't read anything about TWICE but that might help tie the MV's ending in with the theory.",2016-08-28 08:08:14+00:00,d6zr9r4,2.0,t1_d6zkunv,16385,kpop
4,"If they instigate, you could ask them, Why do you care so much? Like why do they waste their time bothering with something they hate so much. Also, I find it quite immature to hate a whole genre of music, especially as a musician. It might not be their preference and that's ok but that doesn't negate that there is artistic merit to be found in the genre, not to mention *everyone* in the industry works incredibly hard. Can I recommend you look into Korean indie, r&amp;b, hip hop, etc. See if they're open to listening to any of that. If not... I can't help but side-eye when people just hate Asian stuff for no reason. I won't assume racism is the case here but.. It's just a kneejerk reaction I've unfortunately picked up from experience. But some people really just won't like kpop. And that's ok. And if people like it, like how you like BTS--awesome! Why would anyone ever try to restrict their taste in music? Kpop showed me I like more styles than I thought and really expanded my music taste in general.

Anyway, if all else fails, maybe you can offer that kind of remark to turn things around on them, and if they still bother you, just ignore them. Like really, don't react, don't look angry. Just stop acknowledging them, even if they keep trying to press you, and play more BTS lol. That they use the word ""triggered"" like that in real life tells me enough about their maturity (I have a 15yo brother who likes memes and he would never say triggered in an insulting way seriously). And most importantly, don’t let others bring down what you love. You can learn from BTS themselves. People have hated on their music, insulted them as people, told members to leave the group, and have even made death threats. But what does BTS do when they encounter hate? Sure, it hurts sometimes. But they grow from it and continue to put their all into everything. And now they're so successful and so loved. I hope you keep supporting them and take care of yourself too.

37,"While I think some of the immature/inappropriate responses went overboard, I also think it's a good thing for the public to say that this kind of behavior is unacceptable.

Aggravating the situation might make it a little harder for Jungkook, but hopefully it also taught those hyungs not to be dicks. They don't have to suck up or anything. Just treat others decently. What they did wasn't even crass humor, like what might typically be seen on Weekly Idol. It was just disrespectful, and I'm glad a ton of people and the media called them out on it.

And maybe the spotlight on Jungkook and Min Suk's mistreatment will make other older people/celebrities, who might tend to treat their dongsaengs rudely, reconsider how they treat others (at least to their faces ffs)... lest they face the netizens' wrath lol. I understand Korea has a seniority-oriented culture, but even knetz seem to agree this kind of behavior is crossing the line.

As for Kookie, he gained a burden, and I'm sad this exciting opportunity had a rocky start... but he also gained some experience, that he can hopefully reflect on and grow well from. I've been put in some uncomfortable situations, but it was only through being put in them, that I have mustered the ability to navigate a situation better (like standing up for myself or deflecting well, instead of suffering quietly). I hope it doesn't have the opposite effect of making him more withdrawn but Jungkook is grown up. He knows we and Bangtan love him, so let's trust him to take care of himself.",2016-06-07 05:31:32+00:00,d3z4agl,1.0,t3_4mvqa9,24996,bangtan

39,"Honestly, I've found that being obvious yet subtle when it comes to these interactions only works sometimes. In my experience, the best way is to be brief and straightforward.

You can try going through your boss first. ""This man makes me uncomfortable."" And next time, either have your boss tell the man to leave, or ask if you can have permission to (politely but succinctly) tell him to leave or stop talking to you.

If it helps, try to get into a business mindset. He comes in, doesn't buy anything, and hassles/distracts an employee. You telling him to leave is just business. You don't need to justify anything either. It's not like he can call the cops on you. Businesses have the right to refuse service.

I wouldn't even give him the opportunity to buy something. Because I wouldn't want him to come back.

But if telling him he's not welcome is too difficult, then just say, ""Sorry but I don't want to talk to you."" Fullstop. Again, no justification necessary, and ignore him. Ignore provocative statements, everything. If things escalate, call your boss (or police, if things really escalate). Remember, you have the right to refuse service. Just talk to your boss beforehand. I've worked in the restaurant/service industry so I know how it can be. We've had a lot of entitled people come in and try to get too personal. One person even tried to force their religion on another employee and threw a tantrum when they were called out. But he never came back. Keep it professional but be straightforward. People will usually be too embarrassed to continue being assholes for long.

I wonder what stage they're at in their lives now, though? They're still young but they've spent a good chunk of their early adulthood in Korea's music and entertainment scene, so I wonder how much their life experiences parallel ours at this point.

93,"Song: I love, love the ""sound"" of the music. But it's to the point where I would prefer an instrumental version, without anyone singing/rapping. I was really hyped for this track, and I'm left feeling a little disappointed.

GOT7 is definitely still finding their sound. This song seems to be pretty different and experimental, which I can appreciate but I'm just not feeling it. It's catchy enough that I'll listen to it but it's not one of their songs I'll keep going back to (unless it's to listen to the instrumental).

The rap line seems to be trying out new techniques, which I like. Everyone's trying something different, really. Besides the first 12 seconds of the song, where the singing really ruins it, this experimentation all right... but maybe not meant for the title track. Listening to all their title tracks, there is an element of GOT7 that persists but it keeps getting lost amidst all the sound-hopping.

I feel like GOT7 would benefit from having a vocal with a deeper, edgier voice, or at least more mid- to low-range voice to balance things out. Their vocal line is strong (hello Youngjae) but they all have a higher-pitched, softer voice, lacking in variety and missing out on a certain type of *oomph* that could enhance some of their songs. You could argue it's their style but it tips the balance because the vocal line and rap line are on such opposite sides of the spectrum, that there's no unifying middle voice. Jackson's voice is always really deep in songs but if he could heighten his pitch a little and sang, I think it could blend in. Mark and Bambam also seem to have very pleasant more mid-range voices–if only they would sing. I think *Just Right*, *A*, and *Confession Song* did the best job at utilizing their current vocal style. *If You Do*, as much as I adore it, always felt just a tiny bit lacking once JB's chorus hit. Obviously, things won't change, but I would suggest they find songs that really work with their style, instead of trying to force their style onto songs, if that makes sense. Like I said, they still haven't seemed to find their sound, but maybe they already have and just haven't been able to attack it from an angle that truly sticks.

MV: Oh boy. I guess the trailer was basically the movie, because that MV didn't do much more than showcase their dancing. The performance part was cool but I thought the trailer was intended to hype up the story, not be the story. I like the choreography, cinematography, and production but the lack of new ""storyline"" material was certainly disappointing. I know they were inspired by One Direction's *Drag Me Down* MV, which was kind of cool to see them put their spin on it... except the camera was usually so far away and always moving that it was hard to focus on their dancing and faces because of all the movement. It's a cool effect but some elements were definitely compromised to achieve it.

I guess the only new thing we got was the aftermath of Jinyoung's fall. Maybe some people can theorize and analyze better than I can, but it seems pretty straightforward to me. It's probably more symbolic than puzzle-like, which is completely fine. It's just that the trailer seemed to set up with more but I'm ok with this plot. The only question I can't answer is, why Jinyoung? Maybe there's no special reason behind why they chose him besides his acting chops, which is what I suspect. I also wish there was more new footage, or maybe they should have reserved the trailer scenes for the MV. This could have worked as a dance MV instead.

Conclusion: Well, it's ok. Enjoyable at some parts, all right at others, and... I just try to concentrate on the music in the first 12 seconds. Maybe a lot of my disappointment comes from me expecting things to go a certain way, and then being turned off that they didn't. I wonder how I would have received the song if I heard it fresh, without seeing the trailer or expecting anything. I am still looking forward to hearing the rest of the album though, and with the release of this song, I'll try to have a more open mind and not listen to the Album Spoiler again.

I'm being critical because I really do love these boys. I wish JYPE would do better with them. Even though I enjoy everything they do (even *Girls Girls Girls*), it always feels a little underwhelming, like their potential is not being fully realized. While they have room to grow, I do hope and believe they will get there one day. GOT7 fighting!",2016-03-20 16:12:06+00:00,d16t7bu,1.0,t3_4b7u1a,4331,kpop

120,"I'm reading through the comments and it seems like people are jumping the gun a bit. Some of the comments here sound like it was confirmed he was dating someone. Remember, it's just *rumors* that he was dating a fan. [But according to this source](http://omonatheydidnt.livejournal.com/17434943.html), the alleged fan denied dating him. Instead, she said she just wanted to ""[boast] that [she is] a close friend of a DAY6 member,"" and he was unaware of her uploads.

Honestly, we'll probably never learn the truth of what happened. And, if it's true, while I do think rookie idols forming friendships with super-fans is not really a good idea (considering fan culture), I still disagree with fans' entitlement to their idols' personal lives. And I really hate that the culture encourages this, even though I ""get it"" from a business standpoint. If idols and fans consent to wanting to date or be friends, they should have the right to have autonomy in their personal lives without people harassing them.

And it's not just anyone doing this, but fans? *sigh* Honestly, I am most disappointed by the lack of respect and maturity on the fan side.

As for the girl, no matter what her relationship with DAY6, she as a fan or friend or girlfriend should not have uploaded provocative info, especially without permission. It obviously had the potential to hurt other fans, which it did end up doing. It was a disrespectful thing to do, for Junhyeok (breach of privacy) and for the other fans (showing off, trying to make them feel bad or jealous).

As for his fansites and other fans turning on him just because he might have a close relationship with someone else? That, too, is just.. really immature. I understand if they feel hurt, and they do have the right to choose whether or not they want to support him, but if they were still fans, shouldn't they support him regardless of his personal life? Or at least, even if they're disappointed, not shut him down or attack him or basically let this get out of hand? I don't know what they expected out of this, especially because the rumors were unconfirmed anyway.

If they are regretting their actions because it's (possibly) the cause of him leaving, well... imo they deserve to feel bad. This just feels so similar to how fans backtracked after Jay Park first left. Anyway, we also don't know if Junhyeok had to leave or left of his own accord, or some combination of both.

136,"I know Stanford has already declared his innocence so it's not like more evidence is needed, but I'm a current student and am able to verify through a search on the alum website that Tablo (Daniel Seon Woong Lee) went here and got a Master's in English. (He also lived in the same residence complex I did his freshman year!)

It's also possible to get your Master's degree in only one year because of our coterm program, where you begin taking grad-level classes during undergrad and then only have to do one year of graduate school afterward. In fact, one of my friends is a junior studying computer science and will be FINISHING grad school by the end of senior year.

But the haters don't want the truth. They just want to feed their jealousy with hate. When Epik High came to SF, someone handed him a Stanford hoodie and Tablo posed with it... but you could see from his expression how much TaJinYo has soured his Stanford experience. He was my top inspiration for going to this school, and I'm sad that it's become a source of pain and controversy.",2015-12-05 00:37:20+00:00,cxnks3f,1.0,t3_3veg9z,51171,kpop

146,"Go for it :) I went to a concert alone last month and was one of the few non-Koreans in the whole crowd. I just minded my own business. No one bothered me. I just wanted to listen to the music and had a blast. You can definitely enjoy it without friends!

I waited in line for a long time and just stood there, looked around, thought about stuff, and listened to other people's conversations, all with a blank face. I was obviously alone and had nothing much to do but wait. You can look at your phone if you feel awkward, but I didn't most of the time, and no one paid attention.

Maybe you can practice doing things normally considered ""social"" alone before you go to the concert. For example, go watch a movie alone or eat at a restaurant alone, etc. I am quite anxious when I actually have to interact with people, but I have come to enjoy my own company even in the presence of strangers.

Good luck. I hope you have a great time :)",2015-07-30 05:22:51+00:00,ctl8kt4,1.0,t3_3f3dna,21434,socialanxiety
