Ideally, I want to break into the video game or entertainment industry for an operations, marketing, or HR position. Otherwise I'm open to any other industry, as well as possibly consulting. Any advice on how to create a marketing portfolio, or links to resources, would be much appreciated. Honestly, Google's results confuse me.

Included is an eclectic collection of my experiences but nothing very professionally impressive or relevant. I didn't do anything for the past two summers except work as a waitress again, which I didn't include on my resume – should I?

Also is it too boring, ugly, wordy, cluttered? Be as nitpicky as you'd like. Please, shred my resume to bits. I need the help. Thanks a lot!",resumes,"First real resume – Junior with no relevant work experience, did ""nothing"" past 2 summers",https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/3vwvpu/first_real_resume_junior_with_no_relevant_work/
