74,"The technology advance, we're currently seeing the start of, is without precedent. What's driving this is capitalism's need to reduce human employment. The reasons being that humans are: 

- costly 

- unreliable  

- cannot work 24/7

- inefficient 

- long periods to train

- inconsistent

- require medical aid, holidays, insurance etc 

- company owners only employ humans as a last resort

..

Machines are taking over manufacturing of cars, and many other areas of manufaturing. Yes, humans still play a part, but their role is diminishing in value. Money will still be made, but fewer people will see the benefits of that. I have a number of friends in high-end finance, and they're already seeing the erosion of their jobs, and a number of them are trying to find other work. 

Thats why the **World Economic Forum** is very clear about the significant risks to employment. As is the US government, and are dozens of other governments.

76,"Machines are able to acquire skills faster, and more cheaply, than humans and so humans are losing competitive advantage. Looking at the transport industry alone, where do you think many millions will find employment? Saying that humans found jobs in the past is not a logical basis on which to support your position. You have an argument that lacks evidence. That's why the World Economic Forum in Davos, concluded that AI will be seriously disruptive, displacing millions from employment. And Oxford study shows that in under 18 years, 47% of jobs are likely to be displaced by automation - http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf

AI is unlike any other time during humanity's history. Machines are now better than humans at image recognition, as good as humans at speach recognition. Machines are now better than humans at driving. They are better than humans at the most complex game ever devised by humans. Many areas of manufacturing, trading in financial markets, other areas of finance, as good as specialists in a number of areas of medical diagnosis, the list goes on and on...

Imagine trying to push an extra 57 million through further education, in the US, in the next 18 years. Who will pay for that?

* Per-capita emissions are far higher in developed countries

* Historical emissions (emissions to date) are far higher in developed countries

* Developing countries are most impacted by climate change, they have least contributed to the problem and they did not consent to be put at risk

* 195 of the world's governments have agreed that developing countries should be able to increase their emissions, for the short to medium term, so that their basic human rights can be met

* Developed countries cannot use economic arguments as ethical justification for not reducing emissions

* Younger generations, in developed and developing countries, have three greatest moral authority that emissions should be reduced, as it's their lives that will be most impacted

* Major fossil fuel companies, have knowingly for decades, deliberately mislead the public and shareholders about the long term risks of burning fossil fuels, And as a start, Exxon is being taken to court to be sued to hell and back

* Renewables provide far greater opportunity for employment

193,"Continued technological innovation requires increasing resources to achieve each advancement, and this is due to increasing complexity. This complexity is largely regarded as the accumulation of things, but it's not free, it always has a metabolic / energy cost. 

Higher complexity forces society to acquire more energy, and this is currently primarily through fossil fuels, and having cheap energy supports higher complexity. So, there's  an 'energy - complexity spiral' - they are intertwined, up together or down together.
This can make societies vulnerable to collapse, the best example of which, is the collapse of the Roman Empire.

A collapse occurs when a society rapidly loses an established level of complexity, often due to a loss of money / energy to sustain continued innovation. Post collapse societies are simpler, have fewer parts, are less well organised and often smaller. Literacy and numeracy skills are lost, organisation becomes more local, and that's why these periods are often referred to as Dark Ages.

&gt; The protectionist vandalism of the Brexiters

&gt; In Manchester this week, echoing his comments at the World Trade Organisation in Geneva, Fox claimed to “remake the intellectual and philosophical case for free trade” while warning against “shadows of protectionism and retrenchment”.

&gt; That is rich, coming from the trade secretary whose first act will be to erect a customs border between the UK and its incomparably bigger market (the EU customs union, which Fox wants to leave, takes close to half of British exports, and more if you count in the markets with which the customs union has free trade agreements).

&gt; This week’s discussion of British auto manufacturing’s worries that Brexit will increase trade frictions is a good illustration of the huge challenges Brexit presents and the naivety that characterises the government’s approach to solving them. Nissan’s chief executive, for example, has warned that its investments in the UK may be unviable if Brexit leads to trade barriers with the EU’s single market.

&gt; The government’s response has been that because German automakers export a lot of cars to Britain, the EU would refrain from imposing tariffs on UK exporters, and instead grant Britain continued zero-tariff trade after Brexit. Aside from the simplistic policies (the assumption that the car industry will determine Berlin’s positions regardless of its other considerations; and that Berlin will determine the EU position, regardless of other countries’ positions), this betrays a poor understanding of the economics and institutional functioning of cross-border trade.

&gt; Even on the narrow point about cars, note that while Germany does indeed sell 800,000 a year to the UK market, British-based car plants sell more than that to the EU. About 57 per cent of the cars made in Britain, or 900,000 cars, are exported to the rest of the EU. (Again, add more for the trading partners, such as Turkey and South Korea, to which market access is secured through a deal with the EU customs union.) So while trade barriers in the car trade between the UK and EU would harm German exporters to the UK, it would bring them new advantages in the even larger market inside the EU currently held by British-made cars.

&gt; Fox and other Brexiters reassure us that the EU would not dare to introduce tariffs on UK goods. They seem to harbour the illusion that it would be for the EU, not the UK, to initiate the erection of trade barriers. But this is to get the situation completely backward. It is after all the UK that will leave the customs union, not the EU. And *as a member of the WTO, the UK will then be under an obligation to impose the same external tariff on every WTO member with which it does not have a comprehensive free trade agreement. That means the UK, as a consequence of putting itself outside the customs union, will legally have to impose the same tariff on cars (and other products) on the EU.* It does not have the freedom to choose whether or not to “retaliate”, whatever the EU does. What will this tariff be? Fox himself promised the UK will uphold its current tariff “schedules” in the speech to the WTO. But that is a commitment to impose the same as the EU’s common external tariff, or 10 per cent, on cars.

&gt; (The UK could of course unilaterally impose a zero tariff on everyone, but then good luck trying to get others to grant market access to a UK with no further concessions to grant in return. *The EU is also obliged by the WTO not to give the UK better terms than those available to all WTO members — again, that means the common external tariff — until the two parties agree a comprehensive free trade agreement.)*

&gt; Finally, Fox and many of his colleagues seem to define free trade as trade with zero tariffs. But that is an alarmingly old-fashioned view of trade barriers. Tariffs have not been the biggest obstacle to international trade since the 1980s, and today aiming for zero-tariff trade and nothing more is to place the bar awfully low. It would not deal with the huge costs to trade from having to clear customs and comply with rules of origin, which are significant even if there are no tariffs to pay.

&gt; Then there is the cost of multiple product standards, the elimination of which is the rationale behind the European single market, in which countries agree on harmonised rules, regulations and standards precisely to make it no more expensive to sell across borders as within them. Reintroducing any of these frictions will hurt British auto manufacturing hard, given how many times its supply chain crosses borders (just like the reduction of such frictions is why eastern Europe’s trade with Australia soared after EU accession). Not only are nearly four out of five cars exported, but many of the components are imported and may have crossed borders several times. The average UK content of a “British-made” car is only about 40 per cent, according to the industry’s trade association.

&gt; To commit this act of protectionist vandalism while singing the praises of free trade is to add insult to injury.

15 Military Leaders Who Say Climate Change Is A National Security Threat
http://mediamatters.org/blog/2012/05/30/15-military-leaders-who-say-climate-change-is-a/184705

The first Department of Defense report to name climate change as a national security threat – issued in 2003 – fell largely on deaf ears, as the United States had just thrust themselves into armed conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan as part of their “war on terror”, and climate change wasn’t on the minds of a country still reeling from the emotional and physical damage caused during the terrorist attacks of 9/11.

http://www.wired.com/2015/10/how-climate-change-became-a-national-security-problem/

&gt; Costs

If the UK Brexits, then the costs to the financial industry will be significant, as it'll lose passporting, and guaranteed it will minimise costs by moving elsewhere. That's what the article on Moodys said.

&gt; Generations

It's now almost impossible for the younger generation to get onto the housing ladder. Further, it's very difficult, if not impossible, for the majority of younger people to make the type of income that the average older-generation did in their time.

And nope, the UK would just be another, relatively small population country, with nothing to offer to US, China or Japan other than trade.

Global warming is the increase in *global average surface temperature*, as a result of the increase in greenhouse gases. And climate change is the long term regional changes in climate, that are a result of the increase in global average surface temperature. eg the poles are warming faster than the lower latitudes.

Climate change is already causing significant harm. 

Due to severe drought, between 2006 and 2010, NE Syria lost 80% of its livestock and 60% of its fertile land turned to desert. 1.5 million people were forced to flee their homeland and 3 million were left destitute. And in 2008, a senior Syrian government official said the country would become ungovernable. Global warming wasn't the only cause of strife in the country, but it acted as a 'threat multiplier'. Net result: more than 1 million refugees have flooded Europe.

More concerning, is that Iran has been experiencing a very severe 7-year drought, which experts have said has become the norm. If the drought continues for a further 15 yars, then half of the country's provinces will become uninhabitable. The issue with Iran is that it has a population of 78 million!

That's why one sees this: [Commander of U.S. Forces Pacific: Climate change is top threat](http://www.climatesciencewatch.org/2013/03/10/commander-of-u-s-forces-pacific-climate-change-is-top-threat/) and the [Pentagon has been making the claim that climate change is a national security threat for the last 12 years.](http://www.cfr.org/climate-change/climate-change-national-security/p14862)

Also, think about what caused the rapid spread of the zika virus, which occurred during the warmest year on record. Think about the recent record flooding in Texas and Louisiana, Northern Carolina and New York, UK, Germany, N India etc. And the wildfires and extreme drought.

Developed countries, which have most contributed to the problem, especially on a per-capita basis, will need to reduce their emissions at a faster rate, and they also need to contribute towards a global climate fund, to help developing countries to mitigate and adapt.

Yes, Arctic ice melt doesn't contribute to sea level rise, but Greenland has lost 9000 billion tonnes of land ice, since 1900. Further, the vast majority of glaciers are in retreat. And the other primary contributor to sea level rise, is the thermal expansion of water.

&gt; Antarctic

While the interior of East Antarctica is gaining land ice, overall Antarctica has been losing land ice at an accelerating rate. Antarctic sea ice is growing despite a strongly warming Southern Ocean.

&gt; Extreme weather events

Extreme heat events are now far outnumbering extreme cold events, which is easily understandable when one looks at [this animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uX16kjY_59E), of the Shifting Distribution of Northern Hemisphere Summer Temperature Anomalies, 1951-2011.

Further, I advocate nuclear fusion as being a key part of the energy mix that's necessary to move away from fossil fuels.

As of 7 September, 27 States have now ratified, accounting for 39% of emissions, and now that China and the US have signed, many countries are likely to follow in the coming months.

All countries are now very aware that the time for complacency is long gone, and that global economic and political stability will be threatened if climate change remains unaddressed.

Going renewable is a no-brainer, and the renewable energy sector is offering far more jobs than coal or oil. It's a win/win",2016-09-01 17:06:43+00:00,d75lztw,2.0,t1_d75fk2y,8358.0,politics

And you'll need to include ExxonMobil in that too, as their leading climate research in the 1970s, arrived at exactly the same conclusions.

It's clear that you cannot fault global warming or the mechanism CO2 greenhouse effect on a basis of science, and you instead resort to political arguments and conspiracy theories.

You need to get this, as I'd substantiated my position earlier, that **every established academy of science in the developed world** accepts that the **majority** of recent warming is due to the increase in CO2, from the burning of fossil fuels. Academies of science do not arbitrarily take public positions, on any scientific matter, without having a very high degree of certainty, as their credibility rests on it.

And it's very clear to see in the IPCC's report on climatic forcings 

https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/fig/figure-spm-2-l.png

IPCC: There's &gt; 98% certainty that the planet is undergoing rapid warming. And there's &gt;95% certainty that the majority of warming is due to the increase in CO2. And that's been calculated using a standard mathematical, commonly-used technique called Kalman filtering (also called attribution analysis).

&gt; As is our ability to cut emissions to the point where they will have effectiveness without destroying the world's economy.

China is already committing $6.6 trillion to its climate action. And Scotland, for example, already generates close to 100% of its electricity from renewables. 

http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-china-climatechange-idUSL1N0Z92A920150623

And there's no excuse for not using nuclear. And there are now more jobs in renewable energy than in oil, gas, and coal combined. 

There is no excuse, whatsoever, to not move rapidly across to renewables and nuclear, to say otherwise, means one buys into the conservative drivel about the meltdown of the global economy. So, there are many examples of where countries are rapidly adopting renewables and yet their economies are doing fine.

You said: ""Perhaps we don't know enough about the incredibly complex, chaotic system that is the earth's climate to make such ridiculous statements?"" 

You shouldn't be guessing, or restoring to denial, you should be listening to what the overwhelming burden of scientific evidence is saying.

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTC050FjTVg&amp;t=3s) short animation shows you are so wrong about current extreme being normal.

You should've learnt in basic school physics, that atmospheric water vapour concentration is a function of temperature. A warmer planet means more water vapour, and thus more extreme precipitation events. It's not rocket science.

And if you don't want to listen to what I have to say about extreme events, then at least listening to what the world's insurance companies are saying:

MunichRe: ""Weather dominates insurance claims in 2015""

&gt; ""what hasn’t maintained a constant pace over time have been the numbers of storms, droughts and wildfires. These weather and climate-related events have been climbing steadily since 1980, increasing in number, severity (such as average wind intensity) and often in lives lost. That trend, Rauch said, provides strong evidence that climate change is already impacting human suffering and the world’s economies""

As a start, consider that the last time the Earth had 400 ppm CO2, sea levels were 25 meters higher than today, so given enough time, sea levels are likely to rise to those levels. And the vast majority of the world's major cities, are coastal, so where do you think those populations will move to?

Ask yourself, what is one of the key driving factors being the syrian refugee crisis.

Between 2006 and 2010, during an extreme drought, NE Syria lost 80% of its livestock and 60% of its fertile land turned to desert. 1.5 million were forced to flee their homeland, where they fled to cities and 3 million were left destitute. And it 2008, a senior Syrian government official said the country would become ungovernable. 

Climate change wasn't the only factor, but it acted as a threat multiplier.

Similarly, Iran has been going through an extreme 7 year drought, which experts have said is becoming the norm. If the drought continues for a further 15 years, then half of the country's provinces will become uninhabitable. The key issue here is that Iran has a population of 78 million!!

That's why climate change is an urgent national security threat.

Science does not know if humans will radically cut their use of fossil fuels or not. Do you understand that?  

Climate scientists can predict how future climate will change based on the main climate drivers - primarily CO2. That's why 195 member governments of the UNFCCC came to universal agreement about the urgent need to reduce emissions. That's why every established academy of science in the developed world, including the American Institute of Physics, accepts that the amjority of recenty warming is attributable to the increase in CO2 from the burning of fossil fuels. 

And observed temperatures fit well within [model predictions](http://i.imgur.com/rZjHYwf.jpg).

There is **NO** ethical argument to justify developed countries not dramatically reducing emissions, and anyone who publicly dismisses the very clear evidence of risks, and current harm, can only be classified as having criminal intent.

And even the US attorney general has said that the courts may prosecute climate deniers:

&gt; “This matter has been discussed. We have received information about it and have referred it to the FBI to consider whether or not it meets the criteria for which we could take action on,” said Attorney General Loretta Lynch

Denial affects the quality of my life as a public citizen, and it will increasingly affect the lives of children and grandchildren. It's morally reprehensible to expose populations to this significant risk. The misinformation campaign by politicians, media and industry, is a deliberate attempt to sow seeds of doubt to limit governments' ability to address the issue:

As a tobacco industry executive once said: 

&gt; ""Doubt is our product since it is the best means of competing with the 'body of fact' that exists in the minds of the general public. It is also the means of establishing a controversy.""

Here's a whole panel of 'experts' and industry claiming that smoking tobacco is not addictive or harmful. Blatant lying, where they should've faced criminal prosecution https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0PYdl99tI

I want to see you argue whether you think it would be appropriate to prosecute those involved in the 'Chinese milk scandal', where toxic chemicals were deliberately added to infant milk formula, where more than 50,000 were hospitalised and six of them died ",2016-08-19 09:01:32+00:00,d6nu2gr,17.0,t1_d6nt666,3031.0,politics

In short, the IPCC is saying that we cannot precisely predict the future climate state, however, we can produce a probability distribution of possible future climate states, which is precisely what the IPCC report proceeds to do.

.  


This isn't a game, and the government isn't going to reat it as such.

Consilience in science is reached when there are many lines of evidence, from many different sources, that all point to the same conclusion. There's a consilience in evolution and germ theory. 

And similarly, there's a consilience in climate science. That's how we know that the core science is robust, and the greenhouse effect is so rooted in basic physics and chemistry, that most university chemistry and physics textbooks would need to be torn up if the greenhouse effect were wrong.

(Btw, research into the greenhouse effect was first started by Joseph Fourier, almost 200 years ago, and he was the same scientist who created the Fourier Series and the Law of Heat Conduction)

- A reliance on false experts (eg scientists who lack expertise in climate science, or people who are not scientists at all)

- Resorting to logical inconsistencies (eg climate changed in the past due to natural causes, they then reason that all climatic changes must always be due to natural causes, which is clearly false)

- Having impossible expectations of science (science isn't 100% certain of anything and models of all physical systems are wrong to some degree, so skeptics then latch onto any uncertainties, acknowledged by climate science, and then claim that the science is worthless)

853,"No, I accept the overwhelming burden of scientific evidence, whereas you dismiss it for ideological reasons.

So then, Mr Armchair Scientist, once you prove that a number of these are wrong, then you'll have my attention:

1. That science's understanding of quantum mechanics, the vibrational modes of molecules and basic spectroscopy is wrong. Btw,  if you prove that wrong then you'll write off most of modern technology along with it.

2. The 2.5 million lines in the HiTran database [(High-resolution Transmission Molecular Absorption)](http://hitran.org/) are wrong in some fundamental way. Remember that there are thousands of spectroscopists, the US DoD and many others would be screwed up. And then you'd show that we don't understand why heat seeking missiles work or early-warning satellites, airborne laser systems, weather satellite observations, micro-wave ovens and a whole lot of other stuff.

3. The Radiative Transfer equation is wrong. And therefore that all astronomers, stellar physicists, planetologists etc are all wrong.

4. That Stellar Physics has got it all wrong. They don't understand stars at all and the Sun hasn't been warming for 4.5 billion years. And the behaviour of millions of other stars we have studied is all misunderstood. So past CO2 levels actually aren't correlated with past temperatures very well at all.

5. Our understanding of geology, isotope ratio studies, paleontology generally is screwed.

6. 2-3 dozen different Radiative Transfer Codes of varying degrees of sophistication are all wrong - see Spectroscopy, HiTran and the Radiative Transfer equation above. But they still manage to produce pretty reliable predictions of both the Outgoing and Downwelling Longwave Radiation spectrum, for the whole globe, different latitudes and seasons. Four wrongs miraculously make a right. Serendipity or what?

7. Roger Revelle was wrong (and all the researchers since who have repeated and extended the work). So CO2 actually is taken up rapidly by the oceans. And pH still doesn't change that fast. And Carbonate/BiCarbonate ratios don't change much. Which basically says that an entire branch of Chemistry, dealing with Buffered Chemical Solutions, is all wrong - thousands of related chemical reactions of all types and the entire Chemistry profession don't understand them.

8. Measured heat accumulation in the oceans is totally wrong. Or there is a magical source of heat somewhere here on Earth; that supplies 4 times the available heat flowing out as GeoThermal heat, and that is magically heating the oceans from the top down. And we haven't noticed it.

9. Basic Thermodynamics is wrong. Changing the thermal balance of the planet won't do much to change the temperature. So scratch the First Law of Thermodynamics. This would rank #1 except you need to tackle some of the issues above before this is a factor.

10. The Clausius-Claperon equation is wrong. So warmer air won't hold more water vapour and thus lead to more warming. Even though we see countless examples of this around us every day - our breath misting up on a cold morning, most of our understanding of refrigeration, air-conditioning etc. And seasonal variations in water vapour content observed from the surface and satellites and their correspondence to seasonal variations in the observed (and predicted) water vapour component of the Longwave Spectrum are just by chance - again several wrongs making a right.

And a key point is that since you're not a scientist, let alone a climate scientist, you lack the relevant expertise to make meaningful judgements about the correctness of scientific evidence of climate change. You don't have any meaningful way to discern.

863,"Every model, of **every** physical system, is imperfect. But just like weather models, climate models are becoming more accurate, year after year, and observed temperature is now shown to fit within the model's 95% envelope. And don't forget that Hansen's model in 1981 predicted 0.5 deg C warming by 2015, and the actual temperature increase was 0.6 deg C!

So, model uncertainties cut both ways. With models sometimes underestimating temperature increases, and they have significantly underestimated Arctic ice melt.


Also, the CO2 greenhouse effect is seen very clearly in **empirical** (historical) evidence. Models are only there to try and predict what's going to happen.

And I don't care what a crappy denier video has to say about the Earth being flat, the moon landings being faked and evolution being false. I listen to what every established academy of science in the developed world, including the American Institute of Physics, has to say about man-made climate change being real.

That's why we're now seeing frequent extreme, and record, flooding in many locations. From china, to India, to the UK, Germany, the US (500 year record flooding in Louisiana last week), record flooding in New York state, North Carolina etc.

We also see that decadal average temperature has been increasing, decade after decade. And we also see that warming in the continued, and now accelerating, sea level rise. And ocean heat content. And land ice melt. And snow cover retreat. That cannot be denied, so don't try and deny it.

And no, a standard mathematical technique, used by many areas of science, called attribution analysis (also called Kalman filtering), is used to attribute the majority of warming due to the CO2 greenhouse effect.

866,"The Antarctic generally is the part of the Earth experiences the slowest rate of warming, mainly because the continent is far away from other land masses (oceans are colder, and warm slower than land masses, and we can see that the Arctic is melting at a very fast rate). And the graphs which suggest CO2 increases follow warming, were taken from the Vostok station in the Antarctic.

Ice core data, taken from other continents, show that CO2 precedes warming. There's more detail about the influence of natural focrings, like solar variation, changes to the Earth's orbit and volcanic aerosols",2016-08-16 17:58:23+00:00,d6jzmi5,4.0,t1_d6jxuv3,2152.0,unitedkingdom

Also, natural variability is ever present, but during more recent decades the warming effect from CO2 has become dominant.

875,"The average global surface temperature decreased slightly from 1940 to 1975. The main reason behind this mid-century cooling was global dimming due to sulfate aerosol emissions from coal-fired power stations. And in 1970 the Clean Air Act was introduced, regulating these emissions. (And it was during the 1970s that 6 research papers, suggested that the cooling effect from sulphate emissions could exceed the warming effect from CO2).

2016 is more than +1 deg C above the pre-industrial average. And note that a mere -5.5 deg C separates current gloal temperature s from the last ice age. The recent rate of increase in global average temperature, is fastre than at any period during human existence.

.  

Btw, predictive models of **all** physical systems, are approximations. We have a model that winter will be colder than summer, but it's only a model. Science cannot make any guarantees about how much winter will be colder than summer, but the model is still useful. And I would wager that there are no more complex models, in all of science, than climate models. And yet James Hansen modeled in 1981, that global temperature would increase by 0.5 deg C by 2015, whereas it  actually warmed by 0.6 deg C.

Good science, is science that is evidence-supported, is rigorous, uses formal unemotive language, has predictive capacity and has passed peer-review by established journals in the relevant field.

So-called 'skeptic' scientists produce an increasingly small contribution to good science. There are very few references to 'skeptic' climate science research articles in scientific literature. So, I'm not denying anything.

Where did you get that idea from?   

Barry Eichengreen, an American economist and Professor of Economics and Political Science at the University of California, says:  

&gt; As the name suggests, one [an economic historian] is neither fish nor fowl; neither economist nor historian. This makes the economic historian a trespasser in other people’s disciplines, to invoke the phrase coined by the late Albert Hirschman. Historians reason by induction while economists are deductive. Economists reason from theory, while historians reason from a mass of facts. Economic historians do both. Economists are in the business of simplifying; their strategic instrument is the simplifying assumption. The role of the economic historian is to say “Not so fast, there’s context here. Your model leaves out important aspects of the problem, not only economic but social, political, and institutional aspects – creating the danger of providing a misleading guide to policy.”

1063,"Lol, that's an invalid comparison. Galileo wasn't in disagreement with a group of scientists, he was in disagreement with the Catholic church. And obviously the church didn't have _any_ scientific evidence supporting their idea that the Earth was at the center of the universe.

.  


And being a true scientist, Galileo would change his ideas when the science failed to support his original ideas. Skeptic scientists don't have _any_ consistent, peer-reviewed evidence explaining why the Earth is warming, and yet they reject the greenhouse effect. Joseph Fourier, the same scientist who created the Fourier Series and the Law of Heat Conduction, first started research into the greenhouse effect almost 200 years ago, and it's founded on basic physics and chemistry.

.

So, how many climate scientists can you cite that oppose the evidence of man-made climate change and who've provided a lot peer-review evidence-based hypotheses? And obviously, I'm not interested in your mentioning of food scientists or medical doctors, I want you to cite skeptic climate scientists.

Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the US. Major oil producers and consumers.

&gt; fraud  

Stop with the conspiracy theories. that would involve subscribing to the crazy narrative that 97% of the world's climate scientists conspired a global environmental crisis, but were exposed by a plucky band of billionaires and oil barons.  

&gt; 1930s  

You're referring to US temperatures. And 1934 was the hottest temperature in the US, until it was eclipsed by 2012.

&gt; HadCRU 

Human civilisation has only thrived during a particularly stable period of the Earth''s climate. We are now rapidly moving beyond that habitable region. Since you need to realise that only ~-5.5 deg C separates current global temperature, from the last ice age, and we're now moving in the opposite direction. As a start, we know that civilisation will battle, even with sea level that's 5 meters higher than today.

&gt; Rising sea levels since the last ice age

We can easily see that global sea level [has hardly changed for the last 7000 years](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Post-Glacial_Sea_Level.png).
At the current rate of change, over a 7000 year period, would mean more than +20 meters sea level rise.

&gt; statements of climate scientists  

That's now historical. Science says that new evidence needs to be considered, and you're failing to consider it.

&gt; Consilience of evidence

We know that there are many separate lines of evidence that are in agreement, the pieces fit together and the picture is clear. All lines of evidence point towards the same conclusion, that the Earth is warming and that warming is caused primarily by the increase in atmospheric CO2, from the burning of fossil fuels. (And know that there will almost always be some scientists who reject the consensus position, just as there are scientists who reject evolution, plate tectonics and germ theory).

The evidence of climate change originates from **many** domains of science (geology, oceanography, physics, chemistry, atmospheric science, zoology, botany, glaciology and others), from thousands of scientists, from many countries, cultures and languages, over many decades. 

That's why **every** established academy of science, in the developed world, including the American Institute of Physics, accepts that the majority of recent warming is due to the increase in CO2 from the burning of fossil fuels.

We're now at the highest temperature, [for the entire Holocene](https://www.aip.org/history/climate/images/Marcott.jpg), which means as a start that it's the warmest temperature for ~100,0000 years. 

&gt; rising since the last ice age

And that graph shows that temperature has been in long, slow decline for the last 5000 years, which means that your hypothesis about cannot support current rising sea levels. And [this graph](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Post-Glacial_Sea_Level.png), shows that global sea level had been particularly stable for the last ~7000 years.

1328,"&gt; Good engineering practices have nothing to do with it  

Go was designed, from the ground up, to solve many of Google's day-to-day engineering issues. Issues that collectively, weren't solvable using any other languages that Google had considered. Google essentially created the language out of necessity.  

I stood on the sidelines for about 18 months, before deciding to commit to the language, and my decisions, like those of many others, were based on these good engineering practices:  


- hardly any overlapping language constructs, and a reduced keyword set, simplifies code comprehension  

- eliminates uncontrolled source code dependencies (C++ has uncontrolled dependencies in abundance)  

- strongly typed

- The language favours composition over inheritance  

- automatic code formatting, removing one of the most-contentious and least-consequential coding issues  

- built-in automatic race detection  

- built-in performance profiling  

- built-in document generation   

- built-in testing

- built-in context-aware search and replace  

- native concurrency support simplifies application design and improves robustness

- compilation generates single target files, reducing dependencies  

- the language spec is bordering on being sealed (ie it's unlikely to have any further revision to the language), which virtually eliminates the issue of code needing to be backwards compatible

The philosophy of the language design runs counter to almost every modern programming language",2016-07-15 12:20:58+00:00,d5d7d9q,7.0,t1_d5d6mri,1815.0,programming

1485,"The example I gave in previous comment (at the end), shows a clear case of misrepresentation of facts.  

.  

Misleading information usually requires tedious, careful analysis to identify whether claims are supported by evidence. A fairly common trait, of an article that contains misleading claims, is their over-reliance on rhetoric and emotive language (sensationalism). This is common characteristic of the DM, Sun, Express and the Telegraph.

.  

Another point, is that there's a strong correlation between misleading articles, and the lack of expertise, in the relevant field, of the journalists who write them. We regularly see this as the case with science denial, where a journalist who only has expertise in an unrelated field and they tend to write about a diverse range of topics. eg a journalist, who studied literature, may write critically about politics, economics, climate science, medical science and GMO.

.  

Further, misleading articles also tend to be less nuanced, they also have a greater reliance (relatively speaking) on conspiracy theories; they often deal in absolutes; they tend to provide fewer reputable references, to substantiate their claims; they often deviate from the consensus view of experts in the field; and they often make implicit/explicit references to political beliefs",2016-06-29 13:50:38+00:00,d4siy53,3.0,t1_d4shmey,2261.0,unitedkingdom
1486,"Absolutely, absolutely, I couldn't agree with you more.  

The media has played a far bigger role, in getting us to where we are now, than most people realise.

I call it 'mediaocracy', and had created a sub for it a while back r/mediaocracy.  

The word isn't yet part of the standard dictionary, but it can generally be defined as:

&gt; The system of maintaining control over a nation by utilizing the media, usually perpetrated under the guise of Freedom of Speech

(it's pretty much like a political propaganda device. When Murdoch was buying the failing Times newspaper, he said that it would be a worthwhile investment because, in essence, he said it would be useful political tool)

The highly divisive rhetoric and misinformation, particularly in media like The Sun, the Telegraph, the Daily Mail etc are some of the key mechanisms by which part of the population becomes polarised in it's views on immigration, the economy, politics etc. And as we saw with the referendum last week, a democracy cannot function correctly if segments of the population relies on broadly misleading information.

And in an advanced, modern, mature country like ours, it's remarkable that (generally printed) media remains part of our society, where it can radically coerce thought and behaviour of the population, with impunity.



Some of the ways in which misinforming media can be countered:  

- [Google will be introducing a technology to rank the factual accuracy of articles](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/03/02/google-has-developed-a-technology-to-tell-whether-facts-on-the-internet-are-true/)

- A group called 'Climate Feedback', has a large [team of scientists](http://climatefeedback.org/community/) that, critically assess the scientific accuracy of printed articles, and provide reports, including deltailed annotations of the original articles. And it's helped to bring attention to misinformation and pressured a number of newspapers to correct their articles. Here's an [example](https://via.hypothes.is/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/05/no-one-ever-says-it-but-in-many-ways-global-warming-will-be-a-go/) - click on the '&lt;' button at the top right of the screen

* Aggregate demand increases, which causes demand pull inflation

* Exporters have less incentive to cut costs because they can rely on the devaluation to improve competitiveness. The concern is in the long-term devaluation may lead to lower productivity because of the decline in incentives

* It reduces the purchasing power of citizens overseas

* A large devaluation can scare off investors, and it makes less willing to hold government debt

Science has a higher degree of uncertainty about their impact on temperature, than most other aspects of the atmosphere.

""Created 100% of our production""?

&gt; Human productivity has been INCREASING in value, not decreasing.   

Workers aren't really getting more intelligent and workers aren't working harder, it just that they can now produce more with less, by using the assistance of machines and automation.  

And in the second graph, manufacturing productivity has clearly increased due to increasing efficiency and automation of machines.

In using that term you assume that technological improvement will lead to the long term increase in wages of all workers. The [evidence](http://i.imgur.com/rfGPUfn.png) shows that exactly the opposite is true. Since the early 1970s, human workers have been decreasing in value, just like the horses that pulled horse-drawn carriages in the early 20th century. The trend in hollowing out the income of the average worker, shows zero signs of improving, and the point will be reached where the low-earning worker can be replaced by automation.

Look at what's happening at [Wendys](http://fusion.net/story/302781/wendys-self-service-kiosks-fast-food-automation/), [McDonald’s To Open 25,000 Robot-Run Restaurants By 2016](http://newsexaminer.net/food/mcdonalds-to-open-25000-robot-run-stores-by-2016/) and supermarket chains across the UK and the EU. Amazon and other online stores are result in the gutting of increasing numbers of retail shops, and Amazon is going to automated an increasing number of their warehouses.   

How do low-earners and the unemployed, earn enough money to pay for potentially significant further education, to hopefully find a better job? And there aren't sufficient educational institutions to take in all of the millions of extra students.  

.   

And what you haven't realised, is that those economists who didn't agree with the idea that there would be a loss of employment from automation, had this explanation: 
    
  ""faith that human ingenuity will create new jobs, industries and ways to make a living, just as it has been done since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution""  [Aaron Smith and Janna Anderson, “AI, Robotics, and the Future of Jobs,” www.pewinternet.org, August 6, 2014]

So that's it? No need for evidence, just have faith? from scientists?

1897,"You're analysis is overly simplistic. What you've failed to note is that between 2000 to 2007 (right before the recession), the adult population growth (19 million: 18 to 64 years of age) far exceeded the increase in full-time employment (8 million). And since the recession your article states ""the number of full-time employees dropped and part-time employment increased significantly."" So, the rate of full-time employment growth has slowed further. Whilst [the hidden and officially unemployed is in long term growth](http://i.imgur.com/qSP69PY.png)

.  


You've also failed to understand the meaning of the exponential function. Machine computational capacity is going to exceed human capacity in under ten years, and machines now exceed human capability in a number of areas, including image recognition.  

.  

The majority of current areas of employment can be automated, large parts of the legal industry, finance, manufacturing, retail, the fast food industry, construction, medical diagnosis and AI is also making progress in research, language comprehension, journalism, political speeches, music creation, art.

1898,"Wage reduction is tied to the decreasing value that workers can provide, which in part can be accounted for by offshoring. But broad sectors of employment, including segments that aren't being off-shored, are also seeing relative wage reduction.  

As a start, the recent [Davos report disagrees with you](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2016/01/18/wefs-davos-report-on-robots-automation-and-job-loss-a-trivial-result-of-no-matter-at-all/#622bd30414f0). And 45% of the current jobs in the US, have been around for at least 100 years, and the vast majority of those jobs are highly vulnerable to automation.  

.   
Also, the study you cite, fails to acknowledge the 'hidden unemployed', where the Department of Labour excludes anyone who:  

- has given up finding a job  

- has stopped looking for work over the past four weeks    

- performs a minimum of one hour work a week and are paid at least $20 (eg mowing the lawn)   

- anyone who has a degree in chemistry or math and are working ten hours part time, because it's the only work you can find, ie anyone who is severely underemployed    

So, [this](http://i.imgur.com/qSP69PY.png) shows what you're missing. And [this](http://i.imgur.com/rfGPUfn.png) shows how median household income has stagnated, relative to GDP, since the early 1970s.   

.   

This is why Finland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Namibia and Switzerland are already talking about the necessity of a universal basic income, because the time is rapidly approaching, when many people won't be able to provide sufficient income for their families to lead reasonable lives.

.  

So think about it, what will the 8.3 million people, currently employed by the long-haul trunking industry, be able to do once they are rapidly displaced by automation? Amazon and other online retail are also gutting retail outlets in many towns around the UK. I also have a number of friends in high-end finance, and some of them have already been made redundant, and are trying to work out how they could re-skill. For people further down the ladder, re-skilling becomes increasingly difficult. Consider utility meter readers in the US. There were 56,000 in 2001, and by 2010 that number was down to 36,000, and by 2023 that number is on course to be zero. And that's just one, relatively small sector of employment, of many that will be going

There's a lot of empirical evidence showing that 3 deg C ECS for doubling of CO2. We've increased atmospheric CO2 by 43% (280ppm to 400ppm), and the majority of the now ~ 1 deg C warming is attributable to the increase in CO2, which aligns quite well with 3 deg C ECS. By your reasoning, the Earth should warm further, yet as CO2 increases, all observations, by which one can determine the heat being absorbed by the Earth, shows a long term warming trend:   

- ocean heat content  

- sea level rise. it's not only increased form a 20th century average of 1.2mm per year, to an early 21st century average of 3.4mm p/a, but it's now beyond that. it's accelerating.  
  

- atmospheric water vapour concentration   


- ocean and land surface temperature   

  
- cooling upper atmosphere   

etc etc.   


.    

Positive feedback is as simple as:   

- reducing albedo from Arctic ice melt   

- thawing permafrost   

- thawing methane clathrates

0.6 deg C warming, since 1970, couldn't by \*any\* stretch of the imagination be considered 'mild'.  Only -4.5 deg C separates current global average temperature from the last ice age, and look at the impacts we're already seeing. Note that multi-national insurers state that a world beyond 2 deg C warming would be 'systemically uninsurable'. increasing flooding damage is already increasing insurance premiums in many countries, with parts of Miami already seeing a 7-fold increase in insurance premiums.   

  
----   

Extreme weather events are now happening in a world that is +1 deg C warmer. Atmospheric water vapour increases 6%, for every 1 deg C increase in temperature, that's basic physics.   
Science is now able to attribute many recent extreme weather events, to climate change, with a medium to high level of confidence: 'A rapid near-time analysis of the UK’s record-breaking wet December in 2015 suggests that climate change increased the odds of the exceptionally high rainfall by 50-75%.'

Last year was the warmest on record, and there's an extremely high level of certainty (&gt; 99.9%) that the record temperature would not have occurred in the absence of man-made global warming.   

Increasing atmospheric CO2 has resulted in a 30% increase in ocean acidity. pH 8.2 to pH 8.05. Studies are here: https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,5&amp;q=coral+bleaching+acidification+carbon+dioxide

You haven't realised that nothing can be 'proven' in science. Science cannot even 'prove' that gravity exists. Proofs are the exclusive domain of deductive reasoning (logic) and mathematics.

So you, a non-expert, can look at the consensus and know that there's scientific agreement about evolution, germ theory, plate tectonics and climate change.   

.   

Science doesn't know of \*any\* mechanism by which an increase in atmospheric CO2 will not result in a positive forcing on global temperature. You don't have any scientific basis for dismissing that scientific evidence, none whatsoever. All atomic molecules and elements absorb electromagnetic radiation, and it just so happens that CO2 absorbs radiation predominantly in infrared. That's something you'll have to accept. If you arbitrarily dismiss then, by the dictionary's definition, you'll be correctly labelled as a 'denialist'. I know that you would rather be labelled as 'skeptic' because you'd try and present an air of legitimacy.

Ocean acidification and increased global average surface temperature is driving coral bleaching. There are hundreds of peer reviewed papers on these topics:

&gt; Back in China in the 1980s, it turns out that **""two-thirds of the decline in households living in extreme poverty occurred between 1981 and 1987, prior to the large-scale expansion in coal power""** 
 

&gt; ..the ‘heavy lifting’ of people out of extreme poverty came from **growth in agricultural productivity**. 

.  

Electricity: I've already shown, Scotland and Germany, are moving rapidly to renewables, and along with nuclear the transition is rapid. There is definitely no excuse for staying with fossil fuels long term, and significantly lower need to stay medium term.  


.  

Acidification: [Smithsonian Institute](http://ocean.si.edu/ocean-acidification), talks about ocean acidification, and it also says:. 

&gt; A drop in blood pH of 0.2-0.3 can cause seizures, comas, and even death. Similarly, a small change in the pH of seawater can have harmful effects on marine life, impacting chemical communication, reproduction, and growth.  
 
. 

Syria: I've already shown that climate change acted as a threat multiplier, by worsening conditions in the country until it became ungovernable. And the risk in Iran is potentially an order of magnitude worse.  

.  

Glaciation: other factors have an influence on global temperature, however, changes in the Earth's orbital cycles takes 1000s of years, so as I've already said, if CO2 could be artificially lowered to say ~180ppm, then we'd likely enter another ice age, but prior to the industrial revolution CO2 levels had been quite stable during human civilisation, the last ~10,000 years

2133,"&gt; Only detractors of hybrids and electric cars think that no one talks about the environmental impact of energy production for them. In fact, we have done so, many times over, and the result of properly-done analyses is pretty invariably that they are less harmful to the environment than normal cars.
&gt; Back to the article at hand, though: The paper being quoted suffered from some significant omissions and questionable assumptions. Credit goes to /u/fooljoe for this summary explaining the problems:
&gt; &gt; Established tools, like the EPA's fueleconomy.gov, are completely at odds with the conclusions of this study. Checking that site, we can see that even in North Dakota, which is cited in the study as the worst place for EVs, the Nissan Leaf has roughly half the emissions of the average new car (250 vs. 480 g CO2 / mile.)
&gt; &gt; The reason for the disparity is a gaping hole in the NBER study: they completely ignore upstream (i.e. refinery) emissions from gasoline. Considering that it takes about the same amount of energy to refine a gallon of gas as it takes to power an EV the ~25 miles that gallon will take the average car, it's easy to see how such a glaring omission will bias the results.
&gt; &gt; Here's another highly questionable assumption of the study: Looking at the supplementary appendix, we see in Appendix D a table of electric vehicles and their gasoline ""equivalents"". In most cases the choices seem to make sense, for example the Honda Fit EV is compared against the gas version of the Honda Fit. However, we see that the Nissan Leaf is compared against the Toyota Prius! It's a rather ""interesting"" assumption to cherry pick the most efficient gasoline vehicle on the roads (and an ""alternative"" type of vehicle in its own right) against the most popular EV, which will of course dominate the results.

So low doses decrease the incidences of cancer and congenital malformations; high doses have the opposite effect. Efforts by radiation protection organizations to lower exposures to (human-made) radiation to as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) provide no benefit.

ECS is the equilibrium state, that is reached many years after CO2 has increased. ie if we were stop all emissions today, global average temperature would continue to rise for many years, this is due to the high heat capacity of the oceans - they will take a long time to warm up.   

.  

The calculation of the long term temperature increase is as follows:  
Radiative Forcing (W/m^2) = 5.35\*ln(CO2_current/CO2_previous).   
Which equates to: 5.35\*ln(400/280) = 1.91 W/m^2    
Also, every additional 1.23 W/m^2 will raise the surface temperature by 1 deg C,   
Therefore an additional 1.91 W/m^2 will yield a temperature increase of 1.55 deg C

.   
The Transient Climate Response (TCR), is a measure of the shorter term increase in temperature, which would yield ~1.08 deg C

2277,"I had the same question about a possible tsunami, and I thought that a meteorite strike could've caused it. This is an extract from the study:  

&gt; The boulders must have been transported to their present position by waves, as two of the largest ones (Fig. 1) are located on the crest of the island’s ridge, eliminating the possibility that they were moved downward by gravity (Hearty, 1998) or are the karstic remnants of some ancient landscape. A tsunami conceivably deposited the boulders, but the area is not near a tectonic plate boundary. The coincidence of a tsunami at the end-Eemian moment is improbable given the absence of evidence of tsunamis at other times in the Bahamas and the lack of evidence of tsunamis on the Atlantic Coastal Plain of the United States. The proximity of run-up deposits and nested chevron ridges across a broad front of Bahamian islands is clear evidence of a sustained series of high-energy wave events.  
  

&gt; The remarkable size of the boulders in north Eleuthera becomes more comprehensible upon realization that numerous boulders larger than 10 m3 have been thrown up on Eleuthera Island by storms during the Holocene (Hearty, 1997). The mass and volume of the Holocene boulders (the largest ∼ 90 m3, Table 4 of Hearty, 1997) are about 10× smaller than the MIS 5e boulders (Table 2 of Hearty, 1997). Hearty (1998) notes that the large 5e and Holocene boulders are all located at the apex of a narrowing horseshoe-shaped submerged embayment (Fig. 2 of Hearty, 1997). Long period ocean waves are funneled into this embayment, generating huge surge and splash even today as they impact the cliffs near the Glass Window Bridge.  

&gt; Movement of these sediments, including chevrons, run-up deposits and boulders, required a potent sustained energy source. Anticipating our interpretation in terms of powerful storms driven by an unusually warm tropical ocean and strong zonal temperature gradients in the North Atlantic, we must ask whether there should not be evidence of comparable end-Eemian storms in Bermuda. Indeed, there are seaward sloping planar beds rising to about +20 m along several kilometers of the north coast of Bermuda (Land et al., 1967; Vacher and Rowe, 1997; Hearty et al., 1998). These beds, from the latest stage 5e, are filled with beach fenestrae in platy grains and thick air-filled laminations, in marked contrast to older stage 5 sedimentary structures that underlie them (Hearty et al., 1998). Meter-scale, subtidal cross beds comprise the seaward facies 15 of the elevated beach beds, reflecting an interval of exceptional wave energy on the normally tranquil, shallow and broad north shore platform of Bermuda.  

&gt; Given the geologic evidence of high seas and storminess from Bermuda and the Bahamas, Hearty and Neumann (2001) suggested “Steeper pressure, temperature, and
moisture gradients adjacent to warm tropical waters could presumably spawn larger 20 and more frequent cyclonic storms in the North Atlantic than those seen today.” We
now seek further evidence related to the question of whether powerful end-Eemian storms in the North Atlantic may have dispersed long-period, well-organized waves to

The Earth's surface is warmed by the Sun, and is obviously a lot cooler, so it emits long-wave (infrared) radiation. This heat is re-radiated back to space.    

The issue is that CO2 almost entirely transparent to the incoming, high-frequency solar radiation, but's it's partially opaque to outgoing long-wave radiation from the Earth. The thickening blanket of CO2 is therefore helping to trap heat.

If the Earth lacked an atmosphere, the Earth would be at an average surface temperature of -18 deg C, which would be hardly habitable. However, due to various greenhouse gases (including water vapour, carbon dioxide and methane), it has a lot more habitable temperature of +15 deg C. A doubling of CO2 will take the Earth's temperature close to +18 deg C, and with land masses warming faster than the oceans, many highly populated regions of the Earth will become far less habitable.

I stumbled across a local, herding cattle, and I tried to explain that I needed water, but he wasn't interested. I even looked for where the livestock drank water from, but had no luck. It was getting late in the afternoon, and still no water. I approached the height of the mountain, and then it plateaued and there was no one around, the road went on for miles. It'd been hours since I'd had anything to drink. All I thought about was water, I had a inkling that the scenery was epic, but I couldn't be sure.

Have you considered contracting? Contracting generally increases one's earning potential, making it an easier way to clear a loan.

Another point is that contractors are usually only brought onto site to work on a specific project, with a limited time frame. The work ends up being more goal-oriented.   

Another point is that I would definitely try and move away from testing.

And climate change currently accounts for 300,000 deaths each year, due to increases in vector borne disease, wildfires, famine, crop failure, heat stress, flooding, increasing sea level rise, increase in extreme weather events, etc. And these figures will worsen, the longer mankind takes to mitigate climate change.    

And due to extreme drought, between 2006 and 2010, NE Syria lost 80% of its livestock and 60% of its fertile land turned to desert. 1.5 million people were forced to flee their homeland and 3 million were left destitute. In 2008 a senior government official said the country would become ungovernable.

.  

Climate change is the biggest public risk facing younger and future generations of all nations. That's why the Pentagon and US military state that climate change stands as the biggest risk to US national security, beyond threats from terrorism, Russia and China.   

.    

The science of climate change is supported by a vast amount of empirical evidence, which stands regardless of what models may or may not predict. And understand that models of *any* physical system are only ever approximations (If the weather service makes inaccurate projections about next weekend's weather, do you then to disregard all meteorological science? No, that would be ridicululous, think about it. And know that the goal of climate models are to make long term projections, and they are likely to be less accurate when looking at shorter timescales). The long term trend in warming and the causes of the warming are unequivocal, that's why every established academy of science in the developed world, including the American Institute of Physics, accepts the consensus on man-made climate change.

Scientific consensus is not part of the scientific method, however, it is useful in determining the degree of agreement in the scientific community of those who are experts in the field. And although evolution, germ theory and plate tectonics are accepted as 'fact', one is likely to still find a small number of fringe scientists who hold contrarian views. Climate science is no different.


.   
And there is no combination of natural factors that could account for the majority of warming.  

- Solar radiation has been in slow decline since the 1970s, as evidenced by the upper atmosphere getting cooler while the surface of the Earth has been getting warmer  

- it's not the Earth's orbital cycles as that rate of temperature change is particularly slow   

- It's not due to volcanic aerosols, as there hasn't been a reduction in volcanic eruptions   

- It's not due to a change in the Earth's albedo  

- It's not due to cosmic rays   

However, science has known for well over a hundred years, that increasing atmospheric CO2 will cause a long term increase in global temperature. And that science is built on basic physics and chemistry.

This will simplify maintainability and backward compatibility.     

- The specification document is short enough that it can be read in a single sitting.  

- It doesn't require any project files, of any description, which can in itself be a significant simplification for some.   

- It compiles to a single file, on all platforms, making distribution a synch.   

- The language and tooling is designed for large-scale projects and it compiles faster than some interpreters take to start up.  

- It's standard library is so mature and feature complete that it makes porting a lot easier. And it targets many platforms, and cross-compilation is a synch.  

- Go has also eliminated one of the most contentious, but least consequently issues, the one of code formatting. The code is automatically formatted using the Gofmt tool.

- Concurrency is a first-class language feature, and along with channels, makes concurrency very easy to understand and implement.   

- Document generation and document serving is built-in.    

- Unit testing is built-in and it's strongly-typed language increasing the likelihood of runtime correctness.     

- It has done away with requiring strict type hierarchies, simplifying design.

2.  The electromagnetic absorption characteristics of various greenhouse gases, including CO2, have been accurately determined under laboratory controlled conditions.  

3.  Most atmospheric gases have been determined to be transparent to solar radiation. The solar radiation that arrives at the Earth's surface, warms the planet, and acting as a blackbody radiator the Earth emits radiation in a spectrum that reflects the surface temperature of the planet; with most of it being longwave, infrared radiation.

4.  And CO2's ability to increase the transit time of longwave radiation has also been accurately determined under laboratory controlled conditions. And CO2 therefore slows the rate at which longwave radiation can leave the atmosphere, which further warms the planet.  

5.  Satellites are measuring less radiation escaping the upper atmosphere than is entering it, a greater absorption is being measured in the electromagnetic bands in which CO2 absorbs radiation.

And it's concentration in the atmosphere is a function of temperature; it's an indirect forcing, so it's increase depends on other forcings. The direct temperature forcing from a doubling of CO2 is 1.2 deg C, and atmospheric water vapor increases by ~7% for every degree increase in atmospheric temperature. The equilibrium climate sensitivity is 3 deg C, so the majority of the 3 deg C is accounted for by the increase in water vapor. However, if one were able to decrease atmospheric CO2, then water vapor concentration will also decrease.

Something to consider, is that the Earth is at the same distance from the sun as the moon, yet it has a global average temperature of +15 deg C, whereas the moon has a average temperature of -23 deg C. In the absence of additional forcings, the Earth would remain in a frozen state, and it's only the presence of carbon dioxide that has allowed atmosphere water vapor to increase.

Doesn't it bother you that so-called skeptics don't have any evidence-based hypothesis to explain the warming?   

Doesn't it bother you that so-called skeptics haven't any meaningful contribution to the scientific knowledge of the climate?   

Doesn't it bother you that, almost without exception, so-called skeptics don't have any expertise in climate science?   

Doesn't it bother you that those who dismiss the scientific evidence of man-made climate change, have a motivation to dismiss the science? ie they want minimal government regulation of corporations, they want small government, their favourite political party supports that view etc.   

Doesn't it bother you that every single established academy of science in the developed world, including the American Institute of Physics, accepts the consensus on man-made climate change?

You see, if I lacked scientific expertise and qualifications and I went to a university's science department, and I said: ""Brain science is flawed because I said so."", or,""Brain science is flawed and fraudulent because I read something in a blog"", that science department would quite rightfully give me a boot out of the building.

'Spacial interpolation' is not sorcery, it's a standard mathematical technique of calculating intermediate values between spatially separated measurements.   

There are more than 11,000 weather stations around the Earth, and although the distribution of those stations isn't uniform, one can still accurately determine the temperature.

Since you focus on the Antarctic:   

- We also know that there's been significant ice loss by using laser and radar telemetry    

- Measurements showing the lowering of sea water salinity around the Antarctic   

- Measurements of ice sheet and glacial velocity, show that many ice sheets and glaciers are accelerating their pace towards the ocean      

- When all sources of sea level rise are accounted for, it doesn't account for the current 3.4mm/year increase. The Antarctic is the missing piece of the puzzle.   [Here are my calculations](http://i.imgur.com/02gTIug.png)   
 

- The Flux Component Method is a means of estimating the total mass inputs and mass outputs for each individual drainage basin and ultimately the ice sheet as a whole. Estimating the mass inputs requires knowledge of spatial and temporal patterns of snow accumulation in regions that are often unsurveyed. In order to make an ice sheet wide snow accumulation map, on site observations of mass through meteorological records, snow pits, ice cores and marker poles are used to ground truth regional accumulation models

Your criticism of GRACE, is like saying that a particularly study cannot be trusted, because you can't be certain whether the CPU they used for calculations contained one of those Intel CPU floating point calculation bugs. Whilst  dismissing the mountain of evidence, from many other studies.

Al Gore is not a scientist, but he doesn't claim to be one, and he doesn't try and refute the overwhelming evidence of man-made climate change. So his opinions are irrelevant to scientific evidence. However, for the record, be said the Arctic 'may' melt entirely during summer months by this year.  

.  

Last year was the hottest on record, this year is on course to be +0.1C warmer than last year, and next year is on course to be warmer still. There is no pause in global surface temperature. And it's further evidence by the fact that it's statistically significant that 1998 was not the warmest year on record.  

.   


It's further evidenced by the fact sea levels are on a long term increasing trend. (since there are 2 primary reasons why global average sea level increases;  thermal expansion of water and land ice melt).  
.  


It's further evidenced by the fact satellites are continuing to measure more radiation entering the upper atmosphere than is escaping from it. And less radiation is escaping the upper atmosphere,  in regions where greenhouuse gases absorb radiation.   

.  

It's further evidenced by the fact that the Arctic, Greenland, Alaska and the Antarctic are on a longterm trend of losing ice **mass**. Alaska has increased it's ice mass loss from 50 to 75 giga-tonnes per year. The combined ice mass loss from Greenland and the Antarctic amounts to 2 tera-tonnes since 2002.  

.  


Etc etc.    

And not only is the evidence overwhelming, but 'skeptics' at the same time lack **any** ability to prrsent any peer-reviewed scientific evidence account for the warming. They are fraudulent in that they have zero evidence for their 'natural factors account for majority of recent warming' hypothesis.

----  

Again, every established academy of science in the developed world, including the American Institute of Physics, accepts the consensus on man-made climate change. So similarly,  if someone went to r/science and made claims that germ theory wasn't true, or that plate tectonics wasn't true, or that evolution wasn't true, then there'd be equal likelihood that they would be banned too.

In the 1970s there were 7 papers that suggested cooling, but there were 42 papers that showed warming! As seen in [this graph](http://i.imgur.com/lKwCOZk.png) which is from [this](http://ams.confex.com/ams/pdfpapers/131047.pdf) research paper.     

And a more recent [study](http://phys.org/news/2014-07-vindicates-climate-accused.html), than Spencer's, shows that temperature observations fit within the models' 95% envelope. James Hansen, the world's most well know climate scientist, in 1981 modelled that the Earth would warm by about 0.5 deg C by 2015. Observations showed it warmed by about 0.6 deg C.  Sometimes models underestimate the rate of change, as [seen here](http://i.imgur.com/Fje80ta.jpg) with under-estimated Arctic ice reduction. So uncertainties cut both ways.    

And don't place impossible expectations on science, since models of any system can never be perfect. Models are approximations. [Look at how well Hansen's model aligns with observations and how poorly  the skeptic Richard Lindzen's models misaslign.](http://i.imgur.com/0lRqKTu.png)

Since the ~1970s, research had expanded into many other areas of science. And today, evidence of global warming and mankind's influence on global warming comes from such diverse fields as: chemistry, geology, atmospheric science, physics, oceanography, zoology, botany, glaciology and others. The research is so compelling, that every established academy of science in the developed world, including the American Institute of Physics, accepts that the majority of warming, since pre-industrial times, is attributable to the burning of fossil fuels.

In that [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles#/media/File:MilankovitchCyclesOrbitandCores.png), the Q/day (the black curve, fifth from the top), shows the variation in solar radiation (insolation) received at the upper atmosphere, due to the changes to the Milankovich cycle.  

And in that graph, one can see how the temperature proxies (the lower two curves) align with peaks in the solar radiation.   

Interesting animation, [Earth's Orbit Eccentricity Precession, Last Million Years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hajMQpLv-YA)  


.   

(What's important is not only the amount of solar radiation that the Earth receives, but also the axial tilt. If the north pole is angled more towards the sun, then Arctic ice is more likely to melt, leading a lowering of northern hemisphere albedo, and so the Earth warms further.) 

.  

As the Earth warms, due to increased radiation from Milankovich cycles, so large amounts of CO2 are released from the oceans as the oceans warm. And it's this release of CO2, which results in Earth warming significantly. So quite expectedly, CO2 is shown to lag warming, but once warming has started, CO2 accelerates that warming (90% of warming is due to the increase of CO2). The Earth's temperature therefore tends to swing from one temperature extreme to another - as seen in the temperature proxies on that graph.  

.   

And once the Earth has warmed, it takes a long time for CO2 to be extracted from the atmosphere, through the chemical weathering of rock, and that in part explains the relatively slow descent of the temperature (as seen in that graph).  

---  

CO2 is the primary forcing that's caused the recent increase in global temperature and it should therefore be our primary focus. But there are other forcings that we need to address too: methane release (fugitive emissions from methane extraction, livestock etc), land use change (reducing albedo), curing of concrete (significant CO2 emissions), etc.  

Attribution studies are very useful. They are used in many areas of science, and they allow one to determine the key factors that cause a system to change. Once science has mathematically modelled each of these forcings (how changes to these physical quantities separately impact global temperature): 

- solar variation  
- volcanic aerosols  
- clouds  
- albedo  
- atmospheric water vapour   
- etc  

They are then able to input the measured physical quantities, for the last 50 years, into the models and then determine which forcings can account for the majority of the warming to date. It took decades of research for science to determine that natural forcings could not account for the warming, however, the forcing from increased CO2 does account for the majority of the warming - [as seen here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribution_of_recent_climate_change#/media/File:Climate_Change_Attribution.png) .   And even without attribution studies, it was well known for more than 150 years that, increasing CO2 would cause more infrared radiation to re-radiated back towards the Earth's surface. (Climate models that provide projections, are only there to try and estimate how climate will change and by how much the Earth will warm).

---    

Once one has worked out that CO2 is the main culprit, it's an entirely separate area of study to try and work out what is the most ethical and effective means of mitigating and adapting to climate change.

Of all of the possible factors that can contribute to global temperature, the net effect is simply the summation of all of the positive and negative forcings.

- volcanic eruptions

So I see the first step is in working out whether there is a long term temperature increase. Every decade, from 1970 to the present, is warmer than the previous decade.   

And I see the second step is in attributing the cause of that increase.

Paleoclimate data:  
What's quite expected, is that the periodic changes of the Earth's orbit, would have a direct effect on global temperature, every 22k, 41k, 100k and 400k  years; and in those cases CO2 increase would have lagged temperature. However, there are far fewer cases where massive volcanic activity released vast amounts of CO2. And the vast amount of CO2 that mankind has released, from the burning of fossil fuels, has resulted in a 42% increase in atmospheric CO2. 

So there are many cases where CO2 didn't initiate warming from past ice ages but it did amplify the warming.  In fact, about 90% of the global warming followed the CO2 increase.

Take note, that a few parts per million of ink can turn a bucket of water blue. The color is caused by the absorption of the yellow/red colors from sunlight, leaving the blue. Twice as much ink causes a much stronger color, even though the total amount is still only a trace relative to water.   

A doubling of atmospheric CO2 will directly cause +1.2 deg C forcing on global temperature. Additional warming will be caused by increasing atmospheric water vapour.  

If you don't accept that increasing global temperature will lead to increasing atmospheric water vapour  (humidity), then it'll be worthwhile for you to revisit high school physics. Atmospheric water vapour has already increased by 4% in the last 35 years.

Btw,  there are other factors, like the lowering albedo due to ice and snow retreat and land use change, increasing atmospheric methane etc. that also have a positive forcing on planetary temperature.

.&gt; ice age 

Nope,  you're wrong about that too. In the 1970s there were 6 papers that suggested cooling, and there were 42 that suggested warming. So, even back then the majority of research suggested warming.

&gt; Water vapour  

Atmospheric water vapour concentration doesn't spontaneously increase. You see, if the Earth lacked an atmosphere it'd be at an average surface temperature of -18 deg C, and having a lot of H20 would not make a difference since it would remain frozen. And even if you heated the oceans, once you removed the heat, atmospheric water vapour would form rain, which would fall back to Earth, and be frozen again. Greenhouse gases, which have a far longer atmospheric residence time is what's really important. CO2 doesn't fall back to Earth as rain. Once it's up there, the concentration remains high for hundreds of years. (You didn't know thst, did you?)

However, you've failed to realise a number of things:  

- All adjustments to temperature records are publicly documented. (surely if there was a conspiracy then the conspiring scientists wouldn't do that?)   

- The adjustments have negligible impact on global average temperature. (why would scientists conspire to adjust measurements if it had no effect on global temp?)

And with a smart phoned secured on the bridge of the handlebars, tethered to a long life battery, and using the CoPilot app, I would set off and merely navigate using the app. Towards the end of the day, and sometimes a bit earlier, I would use the phone to find either hostel, B&amp;B or hotel.

You're misinterpreting the study. The 1000 years they're referring to, relates to the long atmospheric residence time of CO2 *""assuming that 40% of the carbon dioxide peak concentration is retained after 1000 years""*. In layperson terms, the study describes how long CO2 concentration stays in the atmosphere until it's absorbed by carbon sinks. ie, once we put CO2 in the atmosphere, it will stay there for a long time, and therefore the effects, of increased global temperature, will stay with us for a long time too.   

&gt; IPCC   

Where do you get your information from? The scientific evidence of man-made climate change existed long before the IPCC was established. [ExxonMobil knew of man-made climate change, back in 1981](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/08/exxon-climate-change-1981-climate-denier-funding), even President Johnson [spoke of man-made climate change risks, back in the 1950s](http://www.dailyclimate.org/tdc-newsroom/2015/02/president-johnson-carbon-climate-warning) and yet the IPCC was [established in 1988](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change).     

So, you failed there, or are you going to deny what Lyndon Johnson said?

&gt; Conspiracy   

You obviously don't know what a conspiracy is.   

*Conspiracy: an evil, unlawful, treacherous, or surreptitious plan formulated in secret by two or more persons.""*   

Your narrative: 97% of the world's climate scientists conspired a global environmental crisis, but were exposed by a plucky band of billionaires and oil barons. That's what you want people to believe. That's utterly ludicrous, so how on Earth could you fall for that??  

..   

And yeah, obviously almost everyone is in on the conspiracy. You are just part of the fringe who know the truth, right? and will try your best to maintain the status quo.   

*Reality check:* the courts are now moving in. Legal precedents are now being set, most recently in Holland, which forces governments to adopt climate policy, to protect the interests of younger and future generations. You know, the generations that deniers don't give a damn about.   

China has recently put $6,6 Trillion towards meeting its greenhouse gas reduction goals. Europe is making very good progress too, and the US is to force through emissions regulations. Insurance companies, the world over, are well aware of increasing climate-related risk from global warming. And investors are realising that most fossil fuels will have to remain in the ground, unburned, and that coal has already seen its peak.    

*You and your ilk are part of a shrinking science denial movement. Who on Earth, are you going to recruit? Btw, the younger generation certainly wants to have their future looked after, and that's why they are very concerned about man-made climate change. Or maybe you'd rather deny them that?*

3359,"&gt; Maunder minimum    

To quote NASA from that article - ""From 1650 to 1710, temperatures across much of the Northern Hemisphere plunged when the Sun entered a quiet phase now called the Maunder Minimum"".    
That's *before the industrial revolution* and there was also an unusual number of big volcanic eruptions. 

A Maunder Minimum would still have an effect today, but it's effect **would be overwhelmed by the dominant effect of increasing atmospheric CO2**.   

Your error is that you're over-simplifying and then jumping to conclusions. **Just because natural factors have affected the climate, doesn't mean that non-natural factors cannot affect the climate now.**    

&gt; completely compromised by special interest groups.   

On what basis are you able to claim that science is compromised by special interest groups?  Are you someone who has expertise in climate science, and are therefore able to differentiate valid from invalid scientific claims? Obviously not. You don't have any skills to determine whether claims made by any scientist are true or not, but you want rather side with fringe contrarian scientists, since it aligns more closely with your world view.   

You're undermining the science just because you don’t like the economics. That’s a dangerous slope, because the problem of course is you’re not undermining just that, you’re undermining the basis of rational decision-making in society.

&gt; controlling the carbon trading market Ponzi scheme    

One of the proposed solutions is Fee and Dividend, which would be revenue neutral for governments. Fees would be raised against all fossil-fuel based energy sources, and the collected fees would be distributed to all citizens.    

&gt; Your dismissal of scientific facts   

Do you know, that even BP, Shell and ExxonMobil accept the consensus on man-made climate change, and almost every multi-national corporation accepts it too. Coca Cola, Nike, Microsoft, GM, the list goes on and on...  All member countries of the UNFCCC accept the consensus, all 194 of them, and every established academy of science in the developed world, including the American Institute of Physics, accepts it. But you, somehow, even though you have zero expertise, choose to deny, dismiss and ridicule because it suits your world view.   

A Denialist - *""a person who refuses to admit the truth of a concept or proposition that is supported by the majority of scientific or historical evidence.""*  
 
**So the dictionary defines you as a denialist.**   

&gt; Your ideas   

So exactly how did it happen arrive at your conclusion? Were you sitting on your couch, and after watching half an hour of Fox news, you decided right there and then, that the entire domain of climate science, decades of research from fields like physics, geology, atmospheric science, botany, oceanography and satellite measurements, ice cores and all that stuff, was simply part of an elaborate conspiracy by governments to tax their people?﻿ Or maybe you picked up a book, written by 'I'm not a climate scientist', and were sold on their pseudo-scientific arguments?

3360,"&gt; hence why some scientists think we are heading for a Maunder Minimum within 5 years     

The sun is probably heading towards a Maunder Minimum, but absolutely nowhere does it say that the planet will start cooling. On the current trend, the Earth is on course to reach +4.5 deg C warning by 2100. The Maunder Minimum is **only one factor** that contributes the the temperature of the planet.   

&gt; The climate has always changed   

Yes it has, but think a bit further about what is currently causing the temperature to increase.   

The temperature of the planet has always changed, but **greenhouse gas emissions are now the primary cause of increase in planetary temperature**. And as we continue to increase greenhouse gases, so the planet will continue to heat up. 98% of glaciers are in decline, sea level rise is accelerating, record wildfires and high temperatures are now being experienced in Siberia and the Arctic. Crop failure is increasing, coral reefs are starting to bleach. etc etc.   

&gt; What do you think the IPCC, the IMF, World Bank and the global carbon trading markets and Cap and Trade are all about???    

* The IPCC doesn't do any research.    
* The IMF and World Bank do very little research, and almost zero research in the area of climate change.    

&gt; It's about fucking money and control... So facism and government control of information has never existed in history? Right? Is that what you are saying? There has never been dis-information put out in public in order to mis-lead people right????    

There's your conspiracy theory, right there.   
So, how the does the conspiracy work? Do governments control the research of thousands of scientists, across dozens of countries, many cultures, many languages, more than a hundred governments, many domains of science (physics, chemistry, geology, oceanography, atmospheric science, zoology, botany, biology etc) over many decades; **that's utterly ridiculous.**     

*Conclusion:*   

**You'd like to believe that the climate solely changes due to natural causes and that mankind is somehow magically exempt from impacting any aspect of the climate. And you're at a total loss to explain what has caused rapid warming since the 1970s, in spite of solar radiation being in slow decline.**    

(There's actually nothing else that can explain the majority of the warming, other than the increase of atmospheric CO2. Neither Milankovich cycles, nor volcanic aerosols, nor the sun nor cosmic rays.)      

So listen, we literally don't have any time to sit around waiting for you to stop denying man-made climate change.  

Climate science is rooted in the basics of physics and chemistry and experiments started on this almost 200 years ago. You might see some aspect of the science being questioned in the news, but that can't affect the core, because the core is so grounded in what science knows, that science would have to tear up most chemistry and physics text books to be wrong.

3361,"&gt;  fascist governmental dogma as scientific gospel    

You start your reply with one of the key indicators of denial, of resorting to conspiracy theories. For your conspiracy to be true, climate science would have to be the biggest conspiracy in human history; as it would implicate thousands of scientists, across dozens of countries, many cultures, many languages, more than a hundred governments, many domains of science (physics, chemistry, geology, oceanography, atmospheric science, zoology, botany, biology etc) over many decades; **which is utterly ridiculous.**      

&gt; 1) The climate has always changed and always will change.     

What you haven't yet realised, as you're too reliant on low-quality sources of information, is that scientific analysis of past climates shows that greenhouse gasses, principally CO2, have controlled most ancient climate changes. The evidence for that is spread throughout the geological record. This makes it clear that this time around humans are the cause, mainly by our CO2 emissions.   

&gt; 2) Nothing we do as people on this planet will alter #1.  

So, the climate isn't controlled by 'magic' and it isn't separate from the principles of physics and chemistry, *so don't suggest otherwise.*    

[This is a reference](http://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=C124389&amp;Type=IR-SPEC&amp;Index=1#jcamp-tabs) used by chemists and physicists, for information about the chemical and physics properties of compounds and elements, shows the electromagnetic absorption spectrum of C02. This is basic physics, so stop dismissing basic scientific facts Mr Denier.    

&gt; 3) The sun is THE number one thing that affects the Earth's climate    

Think about why the Earth is at an average temperature of +15 deg C and the moon is at an average temperature of -23 deg C, and yet they are both the same distance from the sun.    

What about the amount of cloud cover, the tilt of the Earth, volcanic aerosols, atmospheric gases etc; do you see how you haven't even mentioned the role that those significant factors play. So what you're doing is over-simplifying, and then jumping to conclusions, which is another trait of denial.    

&gt; If the sun's core temperature increased or decreased suddenly by 20%   

[Solar radiation has **decreased** since the 1970s](http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2013/01/08/tsi_composite_strip.jpg). Do you understand that? In light of that evidence deniers are **clueless** as to what's causing the warming. By deniers poor reasoning, the Earth's temperature should almost exactly follow the rise and fall of solar radiation, as seen in that graph, but it doesn't. The amount of solar variation is minuscule.  It's changed by ~0.5 W/m^2 since the 1970s.
   

&gt; IPCC   

The IPCC doesn't do any research. They compile reports, and all evidence they provide is from peer-reviewed established research.   

&gt; cult    

Another favourite word used by deniers.   


**Here's some homework:**    

**1)**   

Here's a thought experiment, but it should be easy enough to try it out for yourself:    

- Fill up a bucket of water   

- Get blue ink, and add a few drops to the water    

- Note how even a few parts per million (ppm) of ink, is able to turn the water blue   

- Add a few more drops, and note how the water gets darker    

Q: Why does the water turn blue? (and yet it's only at a few ppm)

On a hot day, if you put on a lot of clothes, will you then be hotter or cooler? CO2 is no different, in that increasing atmospheric CO2 is a thickening blanket that traps heat.

Developing countries have a right to increase their emissions so that their basic human rights can be met (see the UN1948 - Universal Declaration of Human Rights; everyone has the right to life etc.). That being said, all countries have an ethical duty to reduce their emissions as rapidly as possible. Countries have [common but differentiated responsibilities](http://cisdl.org/public/docs/news/brief_common.pdf).

3406,"You failed to realise that I was answering your question:  

&gt; This tells nothing a language being simple or not. At least not the kind of ""simple"" that matters to a programmer.   

Collectively, the features that I listed shows that Go simplifies development.   

Remember that Go was created out of necessity, as there weren't any languages that adopted all of the good engineering practices that Google thought were important for the projects that they were building. The creators weren't trying to achieve some theoretical ideal, they instead took the approach of creating a language that was overwhelmingly about simplicity, pragmatism and refinement.    

&gt; Go doesn't have makefiles   

Go not having project files is a major win.   

&gt;  the Akka framework is very good in that department.   

Concurrency in Go is a first-class language feature and it's immensely powerful. A Go application can start up tens of thousands of lightweight 'go routines' with very little overhead. They are very easy to create:   

    go func()     // This starts up a new go routine and runs the method 'func' in that context.    

And communicating between go routines, using channels, is absurdly simple and robust. Eg here's a load balancer:  
   
    (it ensures that other workers can run when one blocks)   
    
    func worker(in &lt;-chan *Work, out chan&lt;- *Work) {
       for w := range in {
          w.z = w.x * w.y
          Sleep(w.z)
          out &lt;- w
       }
    }
    
    func Run() {
       in, out := make(chan *Work), make(chan *Work)
       for i := 0; i &lt; NumWorkers; i++ {
           go worker(in, out)
       }
       go sendLotsOfWork(in)
       receiveLotsOfResults(out)
    }
    

&gt; static binaries    

Go always compiles the application to a single, static binary. Deployment doesn't have to worry about what version of the JVM or MFC or .Net libraries that's available. It just runs, and it makes deployment so much simpler and easier.   

&gt; Code formatting   

The code formatting in Go isn't some optional extra. All code is formatted to the style that's specified by the spec. C++ has tools that one can use to stylise code, and yet every C++ project I've worked on code formatting has always been an issue. Go simplifies development by removing the highly contentious issue.     

&gt; If you were Japanese    

You're rationalising and I'm not sure what would happen in that case. There's very clear benefit in eliminating redundant syntax:   

    type Example struct     // this type is publicly accessible    

And    

    type example struct      // this type is private

How can one get simpler than that?    


&gt; Implicit implementation of interfaces     

An example of how powerful it is, is that any structure can implement the error interface merely by creating a method called 'Error()' that returns a type of string. It follows the same philosophy of the Plan 9 operating system; Plan 9 provides all operating system resources through a file interface calling standard file operations, open, read, write, and close; this massively reduces the system complexity, since anything that understands the file interface can access any operating system resources.

&gt; Go language is being finalised    

Yes, the language is being finalised. Go adopts the philosophy of 'less is exponentially more'. The creators are adamant that Go will not be subject to endless feature creep, increasing complexity and language versioning issues that are so prevalent in virtually every other language.     

&gt; Go is quicker and easier to learn    

Google has found this a very significant issue for it's projects. I have have found it too. I've been developing in C++ for 20 years, and I've yet to meet anyone who knows even close to 90% of the language. With Go, it's easy to remember the entire spec, meaning there's very little chance for ambiguity and interpretation. And developers can start being productive the first day they start using the language.    

&gt; Leading technology companies are choosing Go     

Go is rapidly becoming the dominant language in the cloud. And by *'choosing'* I mean that that's where increasingly more technology companies are going, as can be seen [here](https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=golang), for a whole class of internet / network / systems development.    

Btw, if Brainfuck provided many advantages and simplified development, and it had been successfully used in large scale commercial projects, then I would consider using that language. But it doesn't, so I won't be considering it.

3408,"Go's lack of makefiles and project files simplifies building projects.   

Go's absurdly simple, native, concurrency features, simplifies design and implementation. There are very few mainstream languages that can compete with Go in this area.     

Go's compilation to a single static binary simplifies deployment.  

Go's automatic code formatting simplifies the language by improving readability and removing one of the most contentious and least consequential coding issues.      

Go's implicit interface implementations means no rigid class hierarchies, and it eases extensibility. And Go supports composition, not inheritance.    

Go's elimination of redundant features - eg there's only single loop construct.   

Go's language is being finalised; no feature creep or backward compatibility issues.    

Go's types can be made public or private merely by the capitalisation of the first letter, making it immediately obvious whether packaged types are externally accessible.   

Go's design is indisputably minimalistic and it's quicker and easier to learn than Java, C#, Ruby, Python and C++.   

Go is statically typed, improving the likelihood of runtime correctness.   

Ken Thomson (the creator of Unix) and co-creator of Go, said: ""we started off with the idea that all three of us had to be talked into every feature in the language, so there was no extraneous garbage put into the language for any reason."" That philosophy has been maintained since the language's inception.   

This is why leading technology companies are choosing Go for a large class of server / network / systems applications.
