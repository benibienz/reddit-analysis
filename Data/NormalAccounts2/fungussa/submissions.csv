After spending some time looking at RSS data, I saw that there's a clear indicator of the greenhouse effect.

I created this graph, which shows the rate of temperature change by decade and by satellite channel (there are a number of channels, at various heights, starting at TLT)

http://i.imgur.com/pWH9jsz.png

The key observation, which is separate from the adiabatic lapse rate, is that the rate of temperature change (in deg C/decade), shows the atmosphere is warming at increasingly faster rate, the closer one gets to the Earth's surface.

And secondly, above ~12km, the atmosphere is cooling at an increasingly faster rate, the further one goes above the Earth's surface.

Here's a different view of the data http://i.imgur.com/iqBoCIy.png

And it's based on this data: http://i.imgur.com/zg11f6R.png

A key prediction made by the greenhouse hypothesis, is that the upper atmosphere will cool, while the lower atmosphere will warm.﻿   

Another point, is that due to the rate of change in temperature rate, the center of the TLT is likely to warm at a slower rate than the surface.",climate,RSS's temperature data (which is every contrarian's favourite source of temperature data) provides clear confirmation of one of the key predictions made by the hypothesis of the greenhouse effect,https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/3tsydr/rsss_temperature_data_which_is_every_contrarians/

When automation eliminates vast segments of employment and when technology becomes the natural first-choice, we'll arrive at a point where we lack true purpose to our lives. Imagine a father wanting to inspire his kids, about what they need to work towards and what they can look forward to when they become adults. He would have little more to suggest to his kids, than to someone who was due for retirement.

The responses that I normally get to the question, are far from convincing and are along the lines of: people will take up more hobbies, or they will spend more time with friends, they'll take up a sport, or more people will work in laboratories, or there'll be more people in healthcare. 

So, what meaningful pursuit do you think people will have in their lives?",Futurology,The Looming Existential Crisis,http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/3fjdlw/the_looming_existential_crisis/
