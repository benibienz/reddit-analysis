A person might try to flaunt his jewelry or expensive car to seem more appealing since the immediate assumption is that they have a lot of money and are successful. Another reason might be to show off your money because you ""have a small dick"" so that you're more likely to get a girl that way, or so they think.

-For most of the maps, lighting is kinda weird. In your trailer it seemed like non of the windows had any glare and most of the players didn't cast any real looking shadows. 
- You should also ass more foliage and stuff like that to your outdoor maps. They seem a little barren without it.
- NPCs or AI or whatever seem really stiff in your trailer. They don't move in a way real people would.

I'm not sure what you're actually capable of changing, but I think those things would help out dramatically as far as aesthetics go. Good luck to you man. You should give the steam key to someone else though

625,"I'm like 99% sure that's incorrect. RGB lights, when shone together, produce white light. I assume these lights are older, before white LEDs were big, and/or they are used to produce a softer white light.


My guess for the camera picking it up as just dim RGBs is because the camera automatically reduces the brightness so the picture isn't super saturated by the brightness of the light, so you really only see the individual bulbs.


Edit: I'm sure differing wavelengths or speeds has something to do with it too. However, you can probably tell I'm not a professional physicist.

1161,"Hey I'm back and I have more advice! 

Before I start I want to say that I actually really like the site on desktop, it looks pretty clean. Definitely better than on mobile when I commented last time.

-Something I might change about the look is keeping the colors centered around a more clear theme. You have too many different shades of blue and purple, and it looks almost as if you guys can't decide between round a sharp corners for your boxes and buttons. 

-You also have shadows beneath some of the buttons and that looks sort of late 90's early 2000's to me.

-Some of the icon artwork look a little tacky, and I think there should be a more uniform theme/ style for them all, instead of just a bunch of different styles with different color themes.

-Grade scaling seems to leave almost every game with a score of between 7 to 8 out of 10. This makes the scoring seem bland and kind of pointless. Games should be graded by their category rather than by comparison to all games, since Stardew Valley is no where near the same game as Bloodborne.

-Lastly, your grading scale for a lot of the games seem a bit unfair for some games, like a low funny rating for Bloodborne (which isn't supposed to be funny).


Thanks again for the opportunity, and I appreciate you guys asking for legitimate feedback. I hope this helps you guys get better.

-I spent years and years of my childhood playing that game with my best friends who lived across the street from me. Every summer night, weekend, or days that were just too hot to be outside, we'd all get together and do local multiplayer or campaign co-op all the way through. We even rollplayed with our players sometimes too!

The thing is, it's not necessarily healthy. You can eat only ice cream and Twinkies and still keep under your daily calories, so you'd still lose weight. Overall it's best to do both, but allowing  yourself to eat junk food and budget them into your daily calories helps you stay sane and keep up with the diet. I really hope this helps!
