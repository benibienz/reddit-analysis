I've had a lot of trust issues for a while now because of a lot of things that have happened in my past, my gf knows and appreciates this. I trust her a lot but sometimes I struggle because of my issues and the distance. 

Lately I've been really worried and insecure about things. Including her going out a lot on weekends and drinking with her friends, and also occasionally hanging out with her ex boyfriend (in a larger group because he's in their friend group). When she does that. For obvious reasons, she can't talk to me much. I miss her a lot when this happens and it makes me really insecure, party because I don't usually never have anything to do because of my current living situation.  We do get to see eachother every other week though.

Anyways, what are some things I should do to try and resolve this for myself and for her. I want to be with her, we love each other. I want to make this work but it's really been eating at me lately and I know it's ridiculous.

TL;DR: I'm insecure of my relationship with my gf for little reason and it's really eating at me. How can I help myself?

A few years ago, I started dating this girl and after about 6 months in, she started pressuring me for sex, because she was already sexually active but I wasn't yet. Eventually we agreed we would have sex for the first during her friends New Years Party. The relationship was pretty toxic over all, so after a year being together we split. 
2 years later, she starts making YouTube videos trying to say she was raped (never mentioning my name), and sending letters to my house addressed to my mother about how I abused her sexually and emotionally. 


From my point of view, it was the total opposite way around, and even when we did do stuff I always made sure things were okay and what not. That's beside the point, but I do want to emphasize that I did NOT sexually assault her in any way, and it really offends me that she's still making issues of it so far in the future.



Anyways, what steps should I take to protect myself? Are there any steps I should take? I haven't spoken to her yet, should I? Should I just wait it out? 


So far nothing she's posted has picked up much attention, and I don't know if she'd try to take any legal action against me, but I really don't want any chance of my name will be mentioned.

I've had feelings for her for a while, but they've grown stronger and stronger as the year has gone by as we've been touching more. (Hugging for long periods of time, dancing together, and even a sort of cuddling) Oh and we say 'I love you' to each other.

The problem is though, she has a boyfriend. 

I've tried to stop my feelings, but she and I both still want our relationship to continue. She knows I'm in love with her and she's even told me she has some reciprocating feelings. She wishes that's he could have both her boyfriend and still have our thing, but she feels guilt as she knows it would hurt him and currently hurts me.

Now things are getting really complicated, and she won't say 'I love you' back. It hurts, though I understand. She may break up with her boyfriend at some point, but it's very unsure.
