25,"As an automated gate engineer I have a few questions. Firstly I noticed the little hinges you've used. I saw someone else mentioned it as well, you can get similar style hinged that are about 300mm long which would be a vast improvement. Or, the one you will probably like less but would be far stronger, bolt through hinges with a matching plate to go on the outside. 

I also have questions about automation as you said the automatic opener is on its way. Brands may be different as I'm in the UK but what brand are you going for? Are you going with hydraulic or electro-mechanical? Are you planning to screw on or bolt through? And have you checked your country's gate safety laws? 

Here in the UK we have recently had an overhaul of super boring, rather annoying, but reasonably important laws to do with installation and operation of automated gates. Of course you can probably get away without any safety being somewhere in deepest darkest Canada but you should be aware of any laws as you'd be legally responsible if some idiot/child chooses to stick their arm through the hinge gap when they're closing.

37,"After I completed my binge watch of Band of Brothers I dreamt an entire war. It was like the second world war but lasted 3 years. All the weapons were almost identical to WWII weapons but with very minor modern twists (like the old wooden Enfield rifles but with the muzzle of an SA80). 

I signed up with 3 friends (who weren't even friends from real life). We went through training together and eventually shipped off to the front lines. We were holed up in the trenches for what seemed like an eternity with the constant exchange of bullets and the fear that never really goes, just gets pushed down and ignored. I saw my friends dieing around me and being replaced by inexperienced children too scared to even fire back. 

The mud and the gore became normal. Any minor joke became hilarious. We did all we could to keep spirits up despite feeling like we were losing our humanity. 

Eventually I found myself returning to England but I could feel happy that I would finally see my family again. I was the only one of my friends to make it back alive. All I felt was emptiness. 

Then I woke up in my room in university with painted breeze block walls. I didn't know what was going on. At first I thought I was in prison and then I slowly remembered what was going on and where I was. I realised that everything I had felt, everything I had seen had been part of a dream. The weird feeling of emptiness and sorrow returns even as I write these words. I still can't understand how I can feel such extreme emotions about something that never happened and something I've never even come close to experiencing.

46,"*Protagonist: Otori Takeo (Brilliance of the Moon)
Antagonist: Ivan Vanko/Whiplash (Iron Man 2)*

Vanko laughed as he looked down at his opponent. How could this skinny child beat him where Stark had failed?

Takeo smiled to himself as he moved silently towards Vanko. The fool was not aware of the Tribe's gifts. His second self faded as his slid his knife under Vanko's armour. Vanko span around in confusion as the blade sliced through the wiring controlling his right leg. Takeo was gone in an instant.

Vanko's arrogant smirk faded from his lips as he realised he had underestimated his opponent. He scanned the warehouse. Unable to see Takeo, he switched to thermal imaging as a shuriken collided with his helmet and fell to the ground. He responded by lashing a whip in the direction of Takeo's form. However, Takeo sensed his movement before the strike was even close. Crates exploded behind him as Takeo sped to the other side of the room.

This goliath of a man clearly had some way to see through Takeo's invisibility. It had to be in the helmet. Vanko lumbered towards Takeo in a limping run as the weight of the disabled leg slowed him. Another whip thundered through the air and was met with the razor sharp edge of Shigeru's sword. As the whip was cleaved in two an almighty arc of lightning threw Takeo to the cold concrete floor.

149,"We ended up completing it in 11 days. We travelled approximately 2800km and had 4 breakdowns. 

We learnt that gears are a bitch but carburettors are surprisingly simple. A tuktuk carrying about 250kg of people and equipment can only travel about 20kmh up a mountain. Most Indian taxi drivers have no idea where anything is and will stop and ask several people along the way.

The worst thing that happened on the trip that we witnessed was on the way to the after party. The organisers had laid on buses to take people from the end point to the after party.  Everyone was in high spirits, drinking and getting a little crazy. Some guys were hanging out the door of the bus and one guy decided he could go one step further and hang off the bars along the side. What turned out to be 30 seconds from our destination the bar broke and the guy fell off the bus and was run over.  Fortunately,  he was able to sit up and was talking when the ambulance came for him. As far as we know he will live but we don't know the extent of the damage. So everyone on that bus was a lot more sombre when we actually got to the party. 

If anyone wants to go to India,  I would highly recommend Shillong and the Meghalaya region as it's beautiful and not too hot. 

Overall, as long as you're not an idiot, it's a great adventure and I would highly recommend driving a rickshaw and not hanging off buses. ",2016-04-17 16:19:39+00:00,d26fflc,,t1_d1yoesz,,AMA

As far as mechanical skills go, my day job is installing automatic gates, so I'm a practical person and learn quite quickly but before this I hadn't really done any vehicle mechanics. They do mechanical talks before you set off and tell you basic things to check when you breakdown. Like fuel filter,  spark plug,  etc. If you want to they show you how to rebuild the carburettor,  which actually came in handy for us when we lost power on a motorway. After checking the simple options I pulled the carb apart and found the slow jet to be blocked (basically a tiny hole that regulates the fuel).

It's more of a challenge than a race, there are about 70 teams of 2-3 people  taking part and some of those will be trying to reach the end first. The tuktuks we have are not designed to travel long distances and have a top speed of about 60kmh (~40mph).

&gt;* What led you to embark on this trek?

Someone I knew from a youth camp I helped set up about 5 years ago had signed up with his fiancee and they wanted a 3rd person to join them and I wanted an adventure. 

&gt;* How packed is your tuktuk among your other teammates and the gear you must have brought with you?

It's fairly packed. Each of us has a 60 litres rucksack plus a smaller bag plus spare fuel and parts and a load of bottled water. There is room for our large bags behind the passenger seat and they double as head rests other bits are wedged around them and then the fuel and our smaller bags encroach on our leg space. It's not uncomfortable but it's not particularly comfortable either. 

&gt;* How would you sum up your trip so far? Any interesting stories?

So far it has mostly been fun with a couple of breakdowns.  First day of travelling our gear cable snapped in the middle of a busy intersection which was fun. Indians don't really use traffic lights, they just find a gap and drive into it. We've had to stop multiple times for cows and goats crossing the motorways. And we've seen plenty a few lorries that have mounted concrete barriers and such.

Oh, and we've been pulled over for selfies a few times just because we're white.

192,"I can't speak from personal experience, but weight training will help a lot as you will begin to fill out some of the excess skin. Also, skin is elastic, yours has been stretched out by the fat you used to have and has become like an old rubber band that is no longer as quick to spring back after holding a certain shape for so long then having that 'shape' removed. However, by keeping the weight off, your skin's elasticity will return and it will eventually retract to fit your new body. 

If you can hold off on surgery long enough, take some more photos 6 months down the line and compare them. You should see the skin becoming firmer and less stretched. It may take a relatively long time for it to return completely but if it saves on having surgery and you're not too concious of your body then it might be worth it. Or give it a while, decide you're too impatient and get the surgery anyway.",2016-03-13 11:05:43+00:00,d0y4al5,3.0,t1_d0xojc5,38856.0,Fitness

Usually for barriers we will have an infrared safety beam across the road, but for various reasons we couldn't put one on the far side so had a wireless beam attached to the barrier arm itself. However, the wireless beam was poop. 

So, I was removing it and replacing it with an underground safety loop. Basically, a thin cable cut into the road and looped round then attached into a controller to detect changes in the magnetic field (like a car driving over it) which then disrupts current to the board to prevent the barrier from lowering.

731,"I awoke looking straight at the alarm clock nestled amongst the junk on my bedside table. **6:59:59,** it read. I swiftly reached out and turned the alarm off before its shrill voice could disturb the quiet of the morning. 
Satisfied with my first victory of the day, I rose and made my way downstairs to rustle up a nutritious breakfast of deep fried bacon wrapped bacon. I savoured every bite as the deliciously greasy heart-attack slid down my throat. 
I looked out the window of my humble kitchen too see an early blackbird fly straight into my dilapidated shed. I laughed as the shit-shack disintegrated. I had been meaning to destroy the crumbling lean-to for a while and all it took was a fumbling feather brain to fly into it and it was done. Today was going to be a good day. Or so I thought. 

After completing my morning ablutions, I hopped in my rusty old jalopy and headed off to my mundane job as a cardboard box flap design consultant. As I drove, I began to daydream of inventing revolutionary new box flap designs. Alas, it was not my place to do so, I was a mere consultant. I returned to reality to realise I had arrived at the office on autopilot. I parked up in a prime location, relishing the luxuries of an extra second. I got out my crappy car to see my colleagues converging on the car park and smiled smugly to myself. 

I walked towards the office as my coworkers battled for parking places. Just as I was reaching to doors I heard a shout from above. I looked up in time to see a shining steel stake falling a split second before it pierced my shoulder and pinned me to the ground. For a brief moment I only felt the warmth of my iron-rich blood breaching the surface of my skin. Then, with the suddenness of a sonic boom, an intense, searing pain rocketed through my body. As I slipped into unconsciousness I could be heard to whisper, ""One. Fucking. Second.""",2015-09-09 21:04:51+00:00,cuw18p5,1.0,t3_3ka4e8,7425.0,WritingPrompts

818,"My ex was abused by a fucking messed up fuck face shitbag twat, I was the first boyfriend she'd had since she had been abused as she hadn't actually been attracted to anyone and intimacy scared her. Her abuse started when she was about 14, when we started going out she was 22. We broke up after almost 2 years because she reverted to being scared of intimacy (even prolonged hugs) after an operation. 

It was really shitty experience because I was aware that she was becoming more distant even though she didn't actually tell me until a couple of months after she'd started feeling that way. I can't even imagine what it was like for her feeling scared every time I went for a kiss. 

I had hoped that it was just down to recovery after the op and her feeling rather vulnerable but it's now a year and a half on from the op and she is still afraid of intimacy. 

Other than the intimacy issues, she is doing great. She is a very positive person, and rarely isn't smiling. She does a lot of kids work at church and she is fiercely protective of them, they are like her own family. 

We are good friends, although occasional awkward moments do occur, and she has said that she truly wouldn't be bothered if she never had another boyfriend so the intimacy thing isn't that big of a deal to her. I still have times when I can't sleep because I want to track the scumbag who abused her down and smash his face to a pulp, but I know that won't achieve anything. And I know that, hard as it is for me to understand, she has forgiven him and doesn't seem to have any issues that prevent her from enjoying life. I'm pretty sure she isn't hiding anything either as we were very open about everything while we were together (she told me about the abuse 3 months into our relationship and she hadn't told her family who she is extremely close with) and still are open with each other and I've become pretty good at telling when something is wrong with her.

What very few humans are aware of is that stairs are actually living creatures, they just enjoy being walked on and can't actually move anyway. So they have been enslaved by the human race. 

With escalators what you don't see underneath is essentially a sex dungeon. There are multiple female stairs and a couple of male stairs being forced to copulate non stop for their entire lives. The males are strapped to fully automated cranes that move them from female to female and pump their reproductive juices into them. The females only have a short gestation period of a couple of seconds hence why escalators can move so quickly. 

When an escalator is closed for ""maintenance"" it is usually because one of the parent stairs has died or has been pumped dry.

998,"""Dammit! Why's that in here?"", I exclaimed as I tripped over my daughter's easy bake oven. ""Lucy! Clear your toys away!"", I called out. 

""Okay, daddy!"", Lucy responded. 

I rummaged through a chest of drawers looking for some batteries. ""There's never any batteries in this house."", I muttered to myself. I grabbed hold of something and pulled it out the draw. It was my wife's vibrator. ""That'll do."" I undid the battery compartment but as I took them out I dropped it. The vibrator rolled across the bedroom floor straight into the easy bake oven just as Lucy came in. I hurriedly reached in to grab it but it wasn't there. I looked inside. Nothing. I could have sworn it went in there. I looked around confused. 

""What's wrong daddy?"", Lucy asked.

""I just dropped your mother's... umm... toy, but I can't find it."" 

""Do you want me to look?"", Lucy questioned as she looked into her oven. 

""Don't worry, Lucy, I'll find it later"", I said, wanting to avoid awkward questions. 

As she left the room, I noticed it darkening outside. ""I'm sure the forecast was for sun today."". I walked over to the window of my twelfth floor apartment and looked outside. ""What the fuck..."" There was something huge and purple in the sky. I hurried out the door and went up to the roof. 

As I looked up at the sky my jaw dropped. It looked like a giant purple dildo just hovering in the sky over New York. As it hovered there I noticed what looked like the end of a battery sticking out the back. I realised I was still holding the one battery I'd taken from the vibrator in my hand. I looked down at it then back up at the thing in the sky. 

This couldn't be real. 

I rushed back down to my apartment. I grabbed a fork from the kitchen and bent it back on itself. I opened the door to Lucy's easy bake and chucked the fork in. I looked in after it. It was gone. 

I was buzzing from adrenaline as I took two steps at a time up to the roof. I burst out onto the terrace and looked up. There in the sky, right next to the vibrator was a giant fork, bent in exactly the same way as the one I had just held. 

""Well, shit...""


**Continued**

I walked back to my apartment in a daze, not quite believing what I was seeing. I turned on the TV to see what the news channels were making of this. If I wasn't just going insane. 

""We now go live to Hugh Jerection in New York City where strange objects have appeared in the sky.""

""Thank you Jeremy. Yes, strange events have been unfolding right here in New York City as, in the last ten minutes, two huge objects have appeared in the sky. The first seems to be a thousand foot long purple phallus, and the second looks like a 500 foot bent fork. As yet there has been no explanation for their appearance. People have been speculating on the possibilities. Many believe aliens to be the cause while the more skeptical are suggesting it is some kind of publicity stunt or art exhibition.""

As the reporter stared up at the objects for moment, I heard a voice in the background yell, ""Forkin' hell! Someone's made a massive cock up!""

""I must apologise to our viewers, it seems we have a joker nearby."" The reporter said while struggling to contain a smirk. 

As I watched I tried to think of some way to mess with them. I hastily grabbed a piece of paper and scribbled on it. I shoved it in the easy bake portal. Then watched the screen as a humongous piece of paper appeared in the sky saying ""Fuck you, Hugh Jerection!"" The camera panned to a wide eyed, slack jawed Hugh. As I watched, I grabbed a bottle of Mountain Dew, I hesitated then picked my phone and called my wife. 

""Hey honey, where are you?"" I asked. 

""I'm in Central Park, are you seeing this?!""

""Yeah, I'm watching it on the news. Listen, I'm gonna need to get indoors.""

""Why?"" She asked cautiously. 

""I don't have time to explain, just do it for me, please. You'll see why soon."" 

""Ok, I'm going."" 

I listened for a moment while she walked. 

""Ok, I'm in a coffee shop. What's going on?""

""Just look outside."" I said as I began to pour the Mountain Dew into the oven. I watched the news as the camera returned to focus on the sky as a huge green pool was forming. 

I sat for a moment and then began to pour over some kind of invisible ledge. A shimmering green waterfall descended on the inhabitants of New York. I could hear the roar of the Mountain Dew rushing through the air being picked up by the news microphones. As it hit the ground with an almighty splash, the people nearest were swept of their feet and those further away began running. I heard my wife gasp as the dew hit. 

""What... You... How did you know?!""

""It will stop in a moment. When it does, come home and I'll explain everything."" I explained calmly. 

She said nothing, she was clearly in shock.

I put the empty bottle down and waited. 

**Recontinued** 

I heard keys in the door and jumped up from my seat as my wife entered. ""Elle, come and sit down."" I grabbed her hand and pulled her over to the sofa. 

""What's going on?!"" She quizzed. 

""Let me show you."" I grabbed a penny off the table and tossed it into the easy bake. Then pointed to the TV where the news channel had switched to just a live feed of the items in the sky. ""Watch...""

""Pete what's..."" Elle, tailed off as she saw a giant penny appear in the sky. ""What?! How?! Is that my...?!"" I watched her face as it dawned on her exactly what she was seeing in sky. 

I took her hand and explained what had happened. 

""So now you're vibrator is a thousand feet long and hovering over New York.""

 ""We've got to get rid of this!"" She announced. 

""Why, we can have so much fun?!""

""Think of the consequences though! What if they fall? It would be disastrous!""

""Fine! Whatever!"" I picked up the oven and walked out the apartment. I went up to roof for a final time. I walked slowly over to the edge. I looked down. There was another roof below. I lifted the oven over my head and threw it off the roof. As it fell, the door flapped open. A loud buzzing filled the air as the oven shattered on the roof three stories below. 

I looked up at the sky. ""Shitballs!"" A 15 foot fly was now hovering over the other objects. As it started to fly off I watched as the remaining items began to fall. I couldn't look away as they hurtled to the ground, terrified of what was going to happen. Ant-like crowds scattered in all directions. 

All of a sudden, the objects seemed to disappear. I breathed a sigh of relief. I looked down at the remains of the oven once more. I could just about see something small and purple in the wreckage. I chuckled to myself in disbelief and slowly wandered back home.

1057,"A couple of years ago I was cycling down a windy road, doing about 30mph, and a came round a gentle corner to suddenly see an hairpin in front of me and slammed on my brakes but the road surface was loose so they didn't really work and I remember starting to fall and then I remember being in someone's car and then I remember being at home showing them where first aid stuff was then I remember being at hospital. 

Apparently when they found me I got up and into their car completely unaided, directed them to my house, gave them my phone so they could call my mum on the way (she was out),  took them down our rather steep stairs and told them wear all the medical stuff was and told them what to use, then got back in the car and went up to A&amp;E after they had cleaned the worst of the grit out my face and shoulder.

I don't know how I did it because I had obviously suffered a bit of concussion. I later worked out, based on the time signature on a photo I had taken at a viewpoint at the top of the hill and the time they said they picked me up, that I couldn't have been unconscious for more than 10 minutes. And I was pretty lucky because the last thing I remember seeing was a large tree straight in front of me, and I wasn't wearing a helmet. I had a small cut on my head and light grazing down the side of my face.

Hydrogen is one of very few elements known to be ""bicomposital metallicites"". These elements are essentially made up of quarks (subatomic particles) taken from atoms of metallic and non metallic elements. The quarks form either metallic or non metallic strands that are then woven together by quantum fusion to form a full atom of a bicomposital metallicite. For example, Hydrogen is made up of strands of Caesium and Helium. Helium is lighter than air and caesium is extremely reactive, which is why the Hindenburg was such a disaster.

It is not known to many but by plugging a portable battery into itself you are creating an extremely dangerous bomb. If left for approximately 6 hours 27 minutes and 9 seconds it will explode causing severe damage in a radius of .473 time the mah of the battery.

Power is generated in these batteries by keeping two opposing gangs of electrons apart. These gangs produce various propaganda and threats to enlist others to their cause. This is what generates he energy that  is then harnessed for the charging of your electronic devices. However by plugging the charger into itself you are effectively creating a bridge over troubled water (there is a song about it) and the two gangs begin to battle until the point at which they realise they are just like each other. At this point they join forces to attempt to destroy their overlords (us) and began generating hot nuclear energy that is extremely volatile and could cause huge numbers of casualties if left unchecked.

I dreamt I was in the trenches during a war that was very much like World War One but the weapons were futuristic versions of the the weapons they used then. Rifles modelled on the old wooden bolt action rifles but with more modern materials. I distinctly remember being with the same group of men, none of whom I recognised as people I actually know. And I fought along side these men for three years and saw many of them die and I felt all the emotions. I remember seeing my 'best friend' get shot and I remember crying and the fear and determination. And I distinctly remember the relief at returning home when it was over and the lingering sadness of the friends o had made and lost. 

Then I awoke in my university bedroom completely confused with eyes blurry with tears feeling weirdly empty. It took a good half hour for me to completely understand that it was a dream and that I never knew the people who had died and had never been in a war. 

That dream will always stick with me because I clearly remember feeling emotions that I have no concept of in reality and will probably never experience. ",2015-07-01 22:17:28+00:00,csp7pbk,1.0,t3_3bsxt1,1151.0,AskReddit

1105,"One night, my friends and I went on our most spontaneous camping trip ever. A friend had had an argument with his mum and got out of the car and therefore had no ride home so I got a text about 10pm asking if I wanted to go camping. By 11pm five of us were stocked up with alcohol and food and trying to set up a tent on a hillside in strong winds and clouds that had descended low enough that we couldn't see more than 5 metres. At this point it was fun because of how ridiculous it was. 

Later that night, we were all in the tent apart from one friend who had gone off to urinate. At this point I should explain that this friend has type 1 diabetes and regularly had dangerously high or low blood sugar levels. He would quite regularly be at the point where he should probably be in a coma, which kinda explains what happened next. 

He came running back into the tent more scared than I have ever seen anyone in my life. He curled up in a ball and hid under his sleeping bag saying something about the 'razorclaw'. At first we laughed because obviously one would assume he was joking but when he remained in hiding muttering about this razorclaw it became apparent that he was deadly serious. 

Being mostly logical people we generally assumed he must have been hallucinating or something but there was always the small doubt that was enough to silence us and turn out the light. I distinctly remember laying there listening intently until I eventually fell asleep.

1113,"I sat in the break room at work staring at the TV. I couldn't quite believe what I was hearing. According to the news report certain people had started developing powers based on the words they had tattooed on their bodies!

I checked the date on my phone. It wasn't April 1st... Could it be true?!

I started daydreaming about having different powers. It would be so awesome to become a superhero! 

I turned to Eric, ""Dude, we should go get tattoos! We've gotta find out if this is true!""

""Hells yeah!"" Eric responded ""let's go now before everyone else decides to try it.""

""Damn right! Screw this work shit!""

As we walked to the nearest tattoo studio we discussed what we're going to get. 

""I'm going with 'invisibility'. It would be so cool! I could easily creep up on bad guys and I could scare the shit outta the boss! What about you, Eric?""

""Screw that! I'm going for 'time control'! I could mess with so many people and they'd never be able to tell it was me! Plus, think of all the bras I could remove!""

""You're such a perve, man!"" 

We walked into the tattoo studio. There was a guy sitting in one of the chairs and another sorting out some of the tools. 

""Hello gents, what can we do for you?""

""Err, we came to get tattoos.""

""No shit! You'll have to be a little bit more specific. ""

""Well I want invisibility written on my arm in Japanese. ""

""And I want time control on mine."" Said Eric. ""Also in Japanese.""

""I'm gonna guess you saw the new report then."" Stated the tattooist.

I nodded. 

""Well, you, time control, go see Mike. He'll sort you out and I'll take the invisible man over here.""

I walked over to the tattooist and sat down in the chair next to him. 

""Have you experienced any powers from any of your tattoos?"" I asked him. 

""Nah, mate. All of mine are pictures, and I'm yet to turn into a naked woman or dragon. I'm going to assume it's all a load of shit until I see it with my own eyes.""

""Fair enough. I figure I don't have much to lose. If it works, awesome! And if not I can just tell people my tattoo means something cooler.""

The tattooist shrugged and rifled through a catalogue. When he found what he was looking for, he showed it to me and then said, ""so where exactly you want it then?""

""I'll go for the bicep.""

""Alright then.""

He fiddled with his tattoo gun a bit then got to work. I gritted my teeth as he began but it wasn't as bad as I was expecting. 

As he was nearing completion, he made a slight noise. I looked at him. 

""What?""

""Nothing, mate. Nearly done.""

He cleaned up the tattoo and allowed me to admire it for a second before applying some kind of ointment and applying a large sticky plaster. 

""You're gonna want to leave that on for a few hours and then after that, regularly apply moisturiser to help it heal up.""

""How much was that again? 30 quid?""

""35, mate.""

I handed over the money and waited for Eric. As we strolled out the shop, one of the tattooists called after us. ""Let us know if it works!"" I heard them chuckle as we walked away. 

""So, how to we know if it worked?"" Asked Eric. 

""I don't know, I guess we just think about what the tattoo or what we want to do I guess.""

""Alright, I'll try first. You'll know if it's worked because you're pants will be round your ankles."" He winked and then scrunched up his face like he was severely constipated.

I watched as Eric's face turned red with the strain. He opened his eyes, panting. I glanced down at my trousers which were still firmly around my waist. 

""Damn!"" Said Eric. ""You're go then.""

I closed my eyes and focused hard on the tattoo on my arm. It felt like my head was inflating. I opened my eyes again. Everything looked a bit weird. I glanced over at Eric. His eyes were wide and his mouth hung open. 

""Did it work?""

""Umm... Not exactly."" 

It looked like he was shrinking before my eyes. I looked down at my body. My legs looked like gas canisters or something. I reached over and ripped the plaster off my arm. 

""Dude, what does mine say?""

Eric stared at the tattoo for a moment, deciphering the kanji. He had been learning Japanese for the past year. He began to smirk. 

""ERIC?!""

""You can call me Phileas Fogg from now on!"" He proclaimed and jumped on my back.

""What the hell?! What does it say?!""

""It says... Hot air balloon!""

He burst out laughing and started rolling on the floor clutching his stomach. 

In desperation I thought of anything I could to avoid thinking about the tattoo. Gradually my head shrank back to normal size. 

""You cannot tell anyone about this!""

""Too late, mate."" Eric said as he showed me his phone where he'd just posted a picture on Facebook.
