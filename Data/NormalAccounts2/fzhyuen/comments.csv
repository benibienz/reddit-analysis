66,"Haha Alhamdulillah, I was vegetarian for 5 years or so before becoming Muslim, let's just say I saw some nasty stuff on my trip to China. So it was very easy for me Alhamdulillah :)

With regards to my experience in Malaysia, people would rarely respond to my salaams or give salaams. Whenever I went to visit a masjid by myself, everyone just assumed I was a tourist when I was just looking to perform my salah. Having a name like ""Felix"" apparently isn't Muslim; culturally I think they're made to believe that you NEED an arabic name. Although the only basis I know for changing your name is that if it means something bad.

But Alhamdulillah, there were many many good experiences too, so don't take this the wrong way! I love going to Malaysia Alhamdulillah. I have many friends from there as well and what not. But yeah a lot of work needs to be done, similarly to everywhere else in terms of just educating people.

I even had a Chinese friend from Malaysia, who spoke of how it was quite difficult for a Chinese person to become Muslim there, because islam ""belonged"" to the Malays, and that it was hard to be accepted and what not.

But yeah, it was interesting :P",2016-03-12 01:40:39+00:00,d0wp6f8,4.0,t1_d0wbq62,21694.0,islam
