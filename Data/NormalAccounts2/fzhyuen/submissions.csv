So recently I've started a youtube channel which currently consists mostly of rants on certain issues and things which I see in the community:
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Ztyexd1-hQP-rUiPul2iQ

But I've noticed by looking at the analytics that only ~20% of my viewers are female. Now I'm not sure if that's because of the content that I'm putting out, or whether or not I am just more well connected with brothers, or just because it's a new channel.

I would like some advice on what kind of content would interest the female viewer, or things that I may do to attract a larger crowd from amongst yourselves; as my intention for making this channel was to reach out to everyone - not just the brothers.

Let me know what you guys think!
