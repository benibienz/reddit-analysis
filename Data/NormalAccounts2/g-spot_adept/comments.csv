He usually had a group of people with him, but he would keep a distance from them, which seemed to be his idea.  He was a womanizer and would try to get the pretty girls at the club, and would have some luck with the gold-digger types, which is no real feat, but many of the finest specimens were not swayed by his wealth, which would frustrate him, and then his cad/douchiness side would be at its worst, as he would be way too forward and creep out the woman.

He wasn't much of a drinker even back then, so we can't blame his aberrant behavior on that.  It wasn't that out of character for a spoiled rich kid you could probably find in many cities across America, they all make you want to hurl, and many of the women would talk to each other, so when they would notice him approaching (he was taller than most people in the club) the hot object of his desire would often navigate themselves to another side of the club, as his reputation as a jerk would precede him.

● However, the old tubes are quite a different story, depending on which numbers are on the boxes, you could have some real gold lurking in there, old tubes can be very valuable and very useful!

● As far as which ones are bad, look for any that have a large white stain on the inside of the glass, (like someone spilled a lot of white paint or powder on the inside of the glass) - those have lost their vacuum and can be thrown away.

354,"CORRECT ANSWER:

it is not high power that will blow a speaker, it is a badly distorted signal that will blow a speaker

------------------------

this is why a low power amp will sooner blow a speaker than a high power amp will - because with the high power amp, it is not turned up in order to get loud, and produces a clean, safe signal for the speakers, because it is not taxed and driven full volume in order to get really loud - whereas, conversely, a low power amp is often over-driven into clipping (harsh terrible wave form) in order to get loud and that is when damage is done.

Say we had two pizza places in town, one is all organic, farm to table, fair trade, freshest ingredients, imported from Sicily, etc.

It's only when you need a colored, biased, BS version to help you rationalize your evil thoughts and deeds that you must rely on the only station that will do that for you.

so the score is, one conservative right wing TV news source, and ZERO liberal ones - and I named off 100 additional BS sources, so that makes the score 101 to 0

-------------------------------------------------

We can debate things if you want, I would love that, but you must base your case in facts, not lies or opinions! - you must cite your sources, and you are not allowed to use sources that have a proven record of publishing lies as facts - you must use the most respected news sources and science sources in the world - e.g. BBC, NPR, PBS, NASA, MIT, Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins, Pulitzer Prize winning newspapers, etc.- here are 100 bogus sources that have been caught falsifying data and that are banned from our debate.

913,"yes, definitely pick and choose which gear to restore - one easy gauge is what did it cost in the first place? - now in the case of a CD player in 1983, it was super expensive due to being new technology, so price is a bad indicator, but say something like a receiver or integrated amp, that is not cutting edge technology, original price and quality often track each other quite reliably

------------------------------------------

so the first thing I would probably do is to get some old October issues of Audio magazine from the 70's and 80's off ebay (called the Annual Equipment Directory) and check the original selling price of all of your gear - and if the amp cost $800+ originally, likely very much worthwhile to restore, whereas a $150 one, maybe not.

---------------------------------------------

You should be able to tell from some research if a component was at the top of its line at the time or at the bottom of it's line, the better stuff had better switches, transformers, etc. and is definitely worth restoring, and a proper restoration will make it last another 30 years at least!

-------------------------------------------------------

also, something like a turntable may only have 2 or 3 capacitors to replace and be quite inexpensive, rather than the 50+ caps in some components

917,"it's the labor that is the big cost, at least if it is done right.

the capacitors themselves average less than $1 each from an authorized distributor such as DigiKey - make sure you do not buy at a local electronics store or ebay or amazon, etc. - You will get counterfeit caps from China that are perfect copies of the real Japanese caps, in looks at least, not in function. - **You must have ""chain of custody"" from the manufacturer in Japan all the way to you.** - this means you go to the capacitor manufacturer's website, see who the authorized distributors are for your country, and only buy from there, no exceptions.

The labor charge depends on the number of capacitors and the difficulty of access, but could run from $150-$600 depending on the complexity of the unit.

--------------------------------------------

So in the case of a turntable or reel to reel, you may just have a few and the labor charge won't be too bad, but some really complex high end receivers or amps could get up there.

--------------------------------------------------

 The hard part is finding a very skilled precision tech, most of the time you find Beavis, great solderers are rare, and usually in their teens and Asian and female! - Just make sure YOU order the capacitors, not the solderer (who is not an engineer)

Also, I never said I was a big Obama fan, but to be fair, he was a big improvement over his predecessor, who took away our privacy, and spent our tax money on wars to make the military complex (including Cheney) billions, while causing the genocide of nearly a million innocent Iraqis (and creating ISIS), as well as spending our taxes to give the wealthy and the mega-corporations even more welfare (where most welfare actually goes, and you thought it went to lazy black women, indeed!)

What we should be spending our taxes on is healthcare for everyone and university education for everyone, at no out of pocket cost - you know, like most other industrialized countries (all of those ahead of us by 20 or 25 places in almost every category), and infrastructure!

So Obama has done a pretty OK job considering he inherited the largest deficit and second largest depression in U.S. history as well as the roadblock do-nothing congress from hell.

But he was certainly no Teddy Roosevelt, not by a long shot, he wasn't in the Bill Clinton ballpark either. (The only one to give us a budget surplus since like the 50's) 

Picking a US President is always the selection of the lesser of two evils, and most Americans realize this, that's how Obama won TWICE.

But I have some major issues with Obama, for example Edward Snowden is being pursued like a common criminal, when he should be welcomed home with the Medal of Freedom and a ticker-tape parade!

I will likely always be an Independent, because Democrats nor Republicans are never correct across their entire platform.

1302,"To protect this radio from damage to some of the harder to find internal components, you need to replace the aluminum electrolytic capacitors as soon as you can, starting with the one(s) in the power supply section.  This will protect the transformers, tubes and other components, as well as improving the performance and safety of the unit.  I would shop for these capacitors at Digikey - great quality and prices.

After doing that, the next things to do would be to test all of the tubes with a serious tube tester such as a TV-7 and the other thing you might want to do is to invest in a used variac (autotransformer) to pull down the line voltage to what it was engineered for originally (likely to be 110V rather than the 125V you are feeding it now)",2016-01-04 21:29:00+00:00,cylz2zf,1.0,t3_3zf8wi,20893.0,VintageRadios
