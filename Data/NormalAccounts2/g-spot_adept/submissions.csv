-------------------------

 it seems there are two kinds of headphone amps:

 
● crappy designs made in China, but with nice manufacturing and very low markup, making the amp only $30-$300 or something like that, but sound quality is crap.  Sometimes the tube section is just for looks. WTF?

 
● well thought out design (i.e. class A SET tube), also often made in China with nice manufacturing and ridiculously high markup (priced $1000-$5000 or more) i.e. ""audio-phool"" pricing

like this one at $3700 - http://www.wooaudio.com/products/wa5le.html

-------------------------------------------------

why can't we have well thought out, high end, class A, single ended triode design, manufactured in China and correspondingly low markup because of the offshored manufacturing?    

--------------------

it's like there are a few companies making nice stuff (woo audio, for instance), but mark it up 1000% or more, which is beyond ridiculous. - even 100% markup seems excessive to me - my other Chinese built electronics have very low markup, that's the whole point of Made in China.

I am a degreed electrical engineer and I know what all of these cost to build, what I am not, however, is a moron, why are they treating us like one?

LG has sold over a million G4's, and definitely some of those went to XDA members, and most of them just to regular folks, so why when a few people out of that million phones have an issue, does everyone suddenly think they need to sell their phone! - It is the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen!

Every mobile phone ever made has had 1 in 10,000 or something have an issue, but I have never run across any G4 owner I know in real life or on XDA with this bootlooping problem, so if it exists at all, it is **extremely** rare.
