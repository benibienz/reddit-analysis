10,"Greetings fellow ICT professionals,

I am currently investigating through research at a University on how to integrate BYOD and CLOUD solutions to an Enterprise network. A part of the investigation requires general queries that I particularly have with some of the implementations of BYOD and CLOUD and it's expectation in the workplace. I have formed it into a Questionnaire on Google Forms for simplicity. These are general inquiries and are not meant to lead or be specific to a topic matter.

NO personal or private personal information is stored or recorded in this form. I would greatly appreciate the contribution or feedback that comes along with your responses. Thank you so much.

376,"Those posts you were referring too about dedicated servers (particularly the one from a network engineer) was very insightful. It provided a point of view from a technical standpoint on the complexity of the problem being faced in the game. 

I definitely appreciate some good info dump for self education and research. I can also see your point of view about not caring for such things, which is also fine. Stating that a customer is ""justifying"" a technical problem is unfair. It is absolutely in their right to do so if that is the case.
