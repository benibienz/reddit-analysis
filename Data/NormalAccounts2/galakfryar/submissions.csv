**TLDR**: [King's Fall 3 Man Relic Dunking](https://youtu.be/IjfsSCabz-4)

---

&gt;**INTRODUCTION**

The first encounter of King's Fall is one of my favourite parts of the raid. It's when the group comes together to cheer on the relic runners as they make their way to the goal for a slam dunk! Here is a guide on how to complete this encounter with 3 guardians!

---

&gt;**MECHANICS**

When one of the relics is acquired (out of two). Round 1 out of 6 begins of the encounter. You must bring both the **relics** to a **dead statue** with a black orb hovering within. Activate the dead statue by **dunking** both the relics on that statue. This process must be repeated **5 more times**. The remaining guardian will have to **break the barriers** that form preventing relic runners access to the dead statues.

All the rounds succeeding the first will have relics spawning **further away** from the middle area. It is up to your relic runners to find those relics and bring it to the middle for status activation.

---

&gt;**ROUND 1**

This round is fairly simple. Two relics waiting in the middle require acquisition that will inevitably start the encounter. Break the barrier that forms in the middle then proceed to dispatch enemies that spawn in the statue area. 

---

&gt;**ROUND 2**

The relics will spawn in the **bridge section** away from the middle area towards the **cave section**. Jumping is required to grab these relics, so try to position yourselves on **high ground** before acquiring the relic and landing on terra firma. This is where the challenge begins. The remaining guardian must be able to break barriers efficiently and move on to the other relic runner to break those barriers. My suggestion would be to use a **high impact fusion rifle**. The phalanx's **do not need to be killed**, the relic runners job is to continue running towards the middle. It is very easy to run past them, make sure **not to touch their shields**. Otherwise, a ditch awaits you guardian!

---

&gt;**ROUND 3**

Same as round 2. However, the relic will spawn on the ground from here on out. Same strategy where **breaking barriers are top priorities**. Ignore phalanx's and run past them with the relics. 

---

&gt;**ROUND 4 ONWARDS**

Now the relics spawn inside the cavern area. Plenty of time to allow phalanx's to move away from the bridge and clear that path for the relic runner. 

---

&gt;**FINALE**

The key here is **speed**. Make sure to grab those relics and run back to the middle **ASAP**. Since there is only one remaining guardian to break barriers. One side will have to wait until that person makes it to the barriers and breaks them. Once they are broken, sprint all the way to the middle and dunk those relics! **Dying after does nothing as this isn't a darkness zone**. Hopefully this helps you guardians try this as a 3 man team to challenge yourselves for the next expansion! Cheers!

Recently, I made a video on how to enter this fun little Easter egg of a room we call the ""Basketball Court"".  However, I realised that making a text guide to accompany it would probably help elaborate the point better. 

**TLDR**: [King's Fall Basketball Court of Oryx](https://youtu.be/D9lQTC96c8s)

&gt;**INTRODUCTION**

Within the Piston Jumping Puzzle of the King's Fall Raid lies the elusive but ever so taunting Easter Egg that we call the Basketball Court of Oryx. It's definitely a fun mini challenge to play with friends and hopefully you can do it too!

&gt;**MECHANICS**

There are ""light spikes"" scattered around the Piston jumping puzzle of King's Fall. In fact, there are 6 of them in total. For the purposes of this guide, I will call them **Switches**. These switches can be labelled based on the amount of spikes underneath them. You can activate these switches by standing near them. In doing so, the light spikes will turn orange/yellow. When you move away, it deactivates and also turns green.

&gt;**SWITCH 1**

[Visual](http://imgur.com/a/gQYCr) 

This switch is located underneath the pathway between platform 2 and 3 during the activation of the bridge to get to the end of this maze.

&gt;**SWITCH 2**

[Visual](http://imgur.com/a/kZ67V)

Probably the hardest switch to get to. Make your way to the dirt area at the final part of the piston jumping puzzle. This dirt area should be immediately noticeable if the cheese method was used to get from the exotic chest area to the other side of this puzzle. You must use the piston next to the dirt area to get to switch 4. Multiple tries are required, so keep trying guardian!

&gt;**SWITCH 3**

[Visual](http://imgur.com/a/F2IYr)

This switch is located next to the calcified fragment in this jumping puzzle. From the entrance, drop down to the lowest ledge where the piston is located next to the fragment. It should be easy to get to.

&gt;**SWITCH 4**

[Visual](http://imgur.com/a/zkJR1)

One of the hardest ones to get to. This requires the unfortunate guardian to get hit with the piston at the entrance. This act will propel you forward to the light spikes that is awaiting your activation.

&gt;**SWITCH 5**

[Visual](http://imgur.com/a/BYpea)

Located at the end of the jumping puzzle, get to the door before the tower climb. Facing the door, the spike should be waiting on your right. You need max agility and probably a sword to get there.

&gt;**SWITCH 6**

[Visual](http://imgur.com/a/Pxmvv)

Once you get across the bridge that was built (without the sword cheese) using the 3 platforms available, make your way to the many pistons on the final part of this jumping puzzle. Head over to the left and get to the area where the ground is dirt. Jump on the spike that points upwards and use it to get to the light spike directly above.

&gt;**ACTIVATION**

[Visual](http://imgur.com/a/F84ou)

Finally, you must activate all these switches in the correct sequence and keep them activated until the ""Dead Piston"" at the entrance of the jumping puzzle activates. Use a sniper to confirm this. The Sequence is as follows based on the labelling used in this guide

PlayStation - 4 1 6 5 2 3

XBOX - 1 6 5 2 4 3

&gt;**FINALE**

Get back to the entrance of the jumping puzzle using swords to climb back to the top and use the now reactivated piston to get to the door hiding behind that annoying hinge and enjoy the Basketball Court of Oryx!

          I promised my viewers to release this weird thing I found during our Warpriest encounter so here it is. So apparently when you ""tap"" the last platform instead of standing on it, it activates all platforms but no one gets the aura. 

What I found was when you ""tap"" the platform, it activates but since you don't technically stand on it the aura is not ""grabbed"". So you can coordinate your group with a weapons bubble and do a countdown before starting the damage phase. This increases the damage potential of the group and allows for organised damage control (Tether timings when aura is grabbed).

Here is a short clip from my Sherpa Run of King's Fall where this is demonstrated,

*You can follow me on twitter (galakfryar) and get notified on when I do Sherpa Runs.*

&gt;**DESCRIPTION**

*This is an offer for anyone interested in learning any raid in Destiny, I am here to teach you the basics followed by a guided instruction of how to perform effectively in a group of 6. I can teach you the best ways of holding major positions (Relic Holder, Sword Bearer, Gaze Holder, Aura holder etc).*

&gt;**TIMEZONE**

*I am in Sydney Time Zone (UTC+10:00), on for the next 5 hours.*

&gt;**EXPERIENCE**

*Over 170+ Completions of Vault of Glass, 1000+ Completions of Crota's End and 160+ Completions of King's Fall, I am a raid veteran with extensive knowledge of all the raids in Destiny. I am usually the raid leader for almost all groups when completing the raids.*

&gt;**USEFUL ITEMS**

**MIDA** - Very good for movement, Lightweight Perk helps for jumping.

**BOOTS OF EAO** - adds extra jump, no brainer.

**SLEEPER SIMULANT** - Great damage on bosses, useful for short damage phases. Awesome against pesky wizards.

**BLACK SPINDLE** - Effective when landing shots, not effective otherwise (Use Thousand Yard Stare)

**HIGH IMPACT SCOUT RIFLE** - Huge ammo saver, rewards players with great aim.

The reason I stopped is the same reason I have stopped entertaining new players in Hard Raids. 

Follow normal raid progression and master normal mode before attempting hard. If you do not, people usually don't accept you into hard mode raids anyway. I have seen people claim to be good at King's Fall and fail horribly multiple times over and over during totems only to finally be carried by someone who has mastered the mechanics of that specific encounter.

So I am starting a new initiative. From now on I am doing Raid Sherpa'ing where I teach people how to perform major roles (relic bearer, sword bearer, gaze holder, aura holder etc) and also how to be an effective raid member in a fireteam of 6.

I understand that because of this that I will get less responses but It will be worth it. Sorry for those who were expecting me to carry you through flawless.

I live in Sydney and play Destiny like a drug addiction. Love doing PvE content that's fun and engaging. Spent most of my time Solo'ing Crota's End ever since March 2015 (Before House of Wolves).

Started doing Raids since hitting level 29 never looked back (Day 1 Player). Super satisfying to complete and doing it in a full group of 6 is exhilarating. Will probably be doing this until the foreseeable future.

&gt;ONLINE

I am usually online during reset hours. Since I live in Sydney, it is usually difficult to schedule. I stay up until around 12am Sydney time. Try to plan accordingly if you want to schedule a full raid run.

&gt;EXPERIENCE

I have over 1500+ Raid completions on my main account. This is what I do best. 3000+ hours of gametime in Destiny and started playing in September of 2014.

&gt;REQUIREMENTS:

Bring the best of yourself. Listen and learn, I have plenty to teach and share about Vault of Glass/Crota's End/King's Fall and your character in general.

&gt;CONTACT

Send me a friend request on PSN: galakfryar with a message ""Sherpa"". I will add you to my favourites group. We can easily schedule a time where you can learn how to complete this raid in the best way possible, with awesome friends!

Just relax and calmly listen to your team leader as he clearly gives you specific instructions on the role you will perform. All you have to do is ask, and you will get help.

If for some reason your group becomes toxic, which does happen in some cases. Please tell your teammates that you are leaving because of it. Don't just leave without any communication. It just spreads negativity and it will affect your teams morale.
