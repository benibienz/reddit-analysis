9,"&gt; ...11-2=9.

Not sure what your point is there, but the equation that SHOULD apply is actually:

&gt; 11 + 2 = 13

Or, strictly speaking:

&gt; -11 - 2 = -13

We subtract 13 wins from the collective record of the Browns' opponents and end up with 47 wins.

But either way I can accept an argument in favor of calculating it out that way.  Maybe you give the Browns credit for their first win against the Browns when they win their second game against them, and vice versa.  What I certainly don't accept is the idea that these teams get credit for beating the shit out of the terrible Browns, and that's an argument for why the Browns are less than terrible.

It's not like this is a new phenomena.  Guess who had the worst strength of schedule by raw record in 2015?  Yup, the *worst-record-in-the-league* Browns again.  When people want to calculate out strength of schedule in a rigorous way they don't count *just* the opponent's schedule, but also the *opponents' opponents* schedule.  And if you add *that* in you essentially use the team in question's record to cancel itself out.  An 0-16 team contributes 16 wins to the *opponent's schedule* but also contributes 16 losses to the *opponents' opponents schedule*.

I'm not sure what our point in all this is at this moment.  It's not like either or us is really arguing the Browns are good.  And I do, in fact, think the Giants could easily lose to the Browns.  This team isn't as good as it's record indicates.  The offense continues to be a predictable shitshow, even if the defense is good and getting better.  They still can't run the ball.  They still employ the services of Marshall Newhouse, Bobby Hart, and the reanimated corpse of Rashad Jennings.",2016-11-21 18:12:28+00:00,da9slok,3.0,t1_da9rci3,1497.0,NYGiants
10,"First of all it's not 60-49, it's 60-49-2.

Second, and more importantly, you should be calculating strength of schedule removing the shared games.  You can't point to 11 other teams (actually it's 10, they've played the Ravens twice) and crow about how strong their record is when *they got fat beating up the shitty Browns!*

So the **actual** opponents' record should be short the 11 wins they got against the Browns, so now their record is:

49-49-2

That seems EXTREMELY average to me.

[EDIT]

I'm wrong.  Their schedule was even worse than that.  I thought to subtract 11 wins by their opponents and leave the opponents with a 49-49-2 record but that fails to account for two wins by the Ravens over Browns, *counted twice*.  It credits the Ravens with having a 4-5 record and playing the Browns twice when in reality they have a 3-5 against non-Browns teams.  So you **could argue** the combined record should be:

47-49-2

I can see the argument both ways.  But no matter which strength of schedule metric you use, the point is it's a far cry from 60-49.",2016-11-21 17:37:22+00:00,da9qua8,1.0,t3_5e4zdr,3287.0,NYGiants

49,"Landon Collins was the worst free safety in the NFL in 2015.  Yes, yes, he's better now; we all agree about that.  *But the bad plays count, too.*  To suggest he immediately got better in 2016 is unrealistic.  Far too many times I've watched a running back or a tight end run across the field on a cross, trailed by a hopelessly out of position Collins for a 13 yard gain.  That's not an accident.  Opposing offensive co-coordinators are picking on the weakest coverage back in the secondary, and right now I make Collins for our **sixth** best coverage defender, behind the 3 cornerbacks, the free safety, and MLB Keenan Robinson.

And frankly, to my eye that didn't change in the last two games.  For those past three interceptions it's not like they were throwing at Collins and he made them pay.  For the first two interceptions they were throwing at someone else, who got their hands on the ball, and after it got knocked in the air like a volleyball Collins came up with it.  For the last interception the QB made a terrible pass and it ended up going directly into Collins' chest.  I guess you give him credit for not making an [awful play, dropping the ball](https://vine.co/v/iBVad1nmOjq) but none of these interceptions are the result of good coverage by him.  And I'm afraid I insist on my safeties being able to cover, especially in an NFL where the run has never mattered less.

I'm happy to admit: He's great at the line.  He's a terrific run defender, and (appallingly) a ~~better~~ more productive pass rusher than both our defensive ends put together.  He's also a likable athlete who manned up and took responsibility for poor plays, unlike a certain douche bag left tackle who bafflingly, pushed around the ESPN reporter covering the Giants this year because - I dunno - because the *previous* guy was critical of his play?

63,"&gt; Yes, they are. In fact, they're the reason for most of the interceptions our secondary has thus far this season. Have you been watching the games? Serious question.

Serious answer?  Yes.  I have watched all the games, and what I know from watching them is that opposing quarterbacks have FOREVER to throw the ball.  And even if I hadn't watched any of the games, I'd know this because, like I said before:

&gt; opposing quarterbacks are currently 31st in the league in time to throw.

It's a really simple question.  Is the secondary good and the defensive ends ineffective?  Or are the defensive ends good and the secondary benefiting from in?  And giving opposing quarterbacks a million years to throw the ball is the answer.  You can feel free to believe the defensive ends are making the secondary look good.  That's your right.   You're also free to believe that the witch doctor with the giant bone through his nose can make it rain.

I should congratulate you, though.  I said I wasn't going to repeat myself but apparently you're slow enough on the uptake that I was forced to.

&gt; WRONG. That looked like fun when you tried it,

It looks like fun when you're right.  It looks like you're a jackass when you're wrong.  Cruz wasn't replaced by two other guys because he was doing well, *I explained, as if to a child.*  

And not a smart child.  Kind of  dullard of a child.  Maybe one somewhere on the spectrum.

He was replaced because the offense was terrible, and he was part of the reason the offense was terrible.  He was replaced because we actually had better players available, and the main reason he was playing at all was that a guy named Victor Cruz was once really good.  He was replaced because after 8 games he had only produced 25 receptions on 42 targets, with only 377 yards and 1 TD.  Which is markedly inferior to the production (31 REC/384 YD/2 TD) of Reuben Randle's first 8 games of  last year, and they showed that stiff the door this off-season.  

Again, you are free to believe the *witch-doctor-with-the-giant-bone-through-his-nose* drivel that a head coach will spout in order to not embarrass the player.  Stuff like ""Oh, I think it was just a better match-up."" or ""we need to go a different way"" or ""jump-start the offense"".  But all that is just code for ""this guy sucks and I'm replacing him with a guy who doesn't suck as much.""

You know, for someone who claims I don't understand how this game works, you appear to be quite credulous when it comes to all the bullshit coaches spout to the press.  In fact I'm kind of worried about you.  Here's a helpful tip, just for you:

64,"Well first thing's first:  Thank you for saying it twice, because I needed you to say it twice.  When you say something stupid and insufferable it's best if you repeat it.  I won't be repeating myself so try to pay attention:

I'm not impressed with guys that don't sack the fucking quarterback.  And I don't find the ""pressures"" that Vernon and JPP are producing particularly compelling.  Not when they're playing in front one of the best coverage secondaries in the league, and not when opposing quarterbacks are currently 31st in the league in time to throw.  These defensive ends aren't helping the secondary get interceptions, the secondary is buying these defensive ends an *enormous* amount of time.  Where are the ""coverage sacks?""  These stiffs can't even get to the quarterback when the secondary is buying them extra time.  The Giants have one of the better secondaries in the league, (2nd in passes defended, 6th in passes defended despite being compared to teams with 9 games played).  You can choose to believe that they're looking better than they are due to a pair of defensive ends who can't actually get to the quarterback, or you can choose to believe 

So you go right ahead and genuflect at the altar of two guys who aren't producing, but hey, at least they have impressive *names*.  Me?  I'll be right here, insisting on **production**.  You know what that is?  I only ask because we haven't seen any of it so far this year.

Speaking of production, this is my favorite part of your post:

&gt; I don't know why you're upset about Cruz being covered by a CB3. Are you aware of the fact that he is our WR2/3?

**WRONG**.  He's our WR4/5.  He's been jumped on the depth chart by Roger Lewis and Dwayne Harris.  And the reason he was replaced was because he WASN'T PRODUCING.  Though, that was before he got injured.  He might be further down than WR5 at this point.  Is there another WR on the roster?  Maybe we can get Marky Mark played in that movie to play WR for us.

My point has never been that Cruz is a bad guy, or that he's overpaid, (although he's DEFINITELY overpaid) my point has been that he's washed up.  Which is a crying shame, but getting pissy about it just makes you look like a whiny little child who can't tolerate anything bad being said about your team.  Maybe you're not a whiny little piss-ant.  I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt, and assume you're NOT a whiny little piss-ant.  You're just **acting** like one right now.

A couple of back shoulder throws to a guy who's getting ZERO separation against the worst cornerback on the field at the time doesn't change Cruz being washed up.  You're telling me they turned into game-winning touchdowns?  All I can say to that is ""Yeah, that Manning guy's good at football.""",2016-11-09 17:15:19+00:00,d9t2139,4.0,t1_d9so2s8,22720.0,NYGiants

70,"The problem with the slant you're talking about is that if you run it too often two things happen:

First, it stops being good.  The CB cheats inside and it stops being available.  The reason lots of us think the Slant is so great is that it's very easy for the QB to see if it's open.  When it's not open he never throws that ball, so all we ever see is the times it's open.  By comparison, say, the out often gets thrown before the receiver's open, often on faith.

Second, and I think more importantly, eventually the safeties start cheating on it.  Then it REALLY REALLY stops being good, because your receiver gets FUCKING KILLED by the free safety.  You know what's worse than a receiver getting his clock cleaned on a crossing pattern?  The receiver getting his clock cleaned on a slat where he's running directly at the safety coming to kill him.

None of these are really reasons to not run a Sluggo, and I'm all for expanding the playbook.

I expect that my strong safeties are actually able to cover people.  Collins is quite good against the run.

And the terrific job he did running the ball back (and both of those returns were, indeed, just awesome - I have to admit that) doesn't mean much unless they draft him into playing running back for them.

76,"&gt; In my opinion JR has had 2 excellent drafts last 2 years.

The evidence so far disagrees with you.  2015 Round 1 Ereck Flowers has played 23 games for the Giants and over that span he's been the worst left tackle in football.  Collins, well, I'll get to Collins later.  2015 Round 3 Owa Odighizuwa only played 4 games last year, due to injury.  This year he's played 7 but somehow he's worse.  His stat line this year?  7 games played 1 tackle.  THAT'S IT.  That's his whole year.  1 tackle.  That's only one more tackle than my GRANDMOTHER would have had.  And she died three years ago.

The 2016 draft is even less promising.  2016 R1 Eli Apple has missed 2 games due to injury.  2016 R2 Shepard is having a worse year than Reuben Randle did last year before the team said ""please leave and play for someone else.""  And 2016 R3 is Thompson.  6 games missed out of the first 8.

There's always a guy or two you can cherry-pick and say ""it's not Reese's fault that XYZ happened!""  But the aggregate doesn't lie.  You don't end up with 20 busted draft picks due to injury through bad luck.  You end up with FIVE due to bad luck and the other fifteen due to being *fuck-all* at your job, which is what Jerry Reese is.

And let's not get too excited about Collins.  He's had one good game.  In his whole career.  Before his two interceptions against the Rams he was best known for knocking himself unconscious while jumping up and down versus the Patriots, and before the Rams game I would have said he was bad in coverage.

Actually he's still bad in coverage, but at least this year he's not dropping easy interceptions.  Took a year to get that far.  So at that pace, some time in year 5 of his career we'll have a slightly below average strong safety.",2016-11-03 21:18:07+00:00,d9kkbh6,10.0,t1_d9kiu77,1805.0,NYGiants

I don't think there's much the Giants can do to create more of a deep threat when opposing defenses are playing almost entirely Cover-2, which concedes the short pass and the run (though we can't run) in favor of keeping 2 safeties deep to prevent the deep ball.

I agree, however, that there's no threat posed by the running game.  That there is insufficient number and variety in the passing plays they run to maintain a credible threat in the passing game, and much of that is the result of coming to the line with ""11"" personnel no matter what, and not even changing things up with so much as trips WR's on one side of the formation.

Do we know Cruz is good?  We know Cruz **WAS** good.  Two years ago.  We know he hasn't played a single down since until this year.  Is he still good?  I don't think so.

Do we know Shepard is good?  I'm not asking what he might become in three years.  Fuck what he'll be in three years.  I want to know if he's good today.  When that guy came onto this team, pundits were saying he was the offensive rookie of year favorite, at least in the non-Ezekiel-Elliott division.  Ain't nobody talking about that now...

You want some perspective?  After 7 games:

Cruz: 24/41 REC, 331 YD, 1 TD

Shepard: 31/48 RED, 334 YD, 2 TD

Neither of them are appreciably better than the first 7 games of the 2015 season from RECEIVER X:

RECEIVER X: 26/37 REC, 329 YD, 2 TD

You know who RECEIVER X is?  Reuben Randle.  The guy the Giants released in disgust, a complete draft bust.  The guy who was so good with Philadelphia that they released him before the start of the season and now he's out of the league.

Cruz is slow.  Old, and slow; dropping passes that hit him in the hands.  And the smart money says at 29 he ain't getting any younger, nor any faster.  That's a crying shame, but pretending it's not the case seems silly to me.  And Shepard isn't a professional WR right now.  Might be some day, maybe as early as the end of the year, but that, and $2.35 gets you a cup of coffee today.

We need to stop, and appreciate the great yawning Lovecraftian HORROR that is our offensive tackles right now.  42% of the time, Manning was running for his life.  And this is in an offense predicated upon getting rid of the ball quickly.

PFF's take:

&gt; It was a rough night for Ereck Flowers and Bobby Hart in pass protection, regardless of who lined up across from them. Hart allowed a sack, two hits, and four hurries, while Flowers allowed seven total pressures of his own. Flowers also had another sack and hurry nullified by penalties on the plays; otherwise, he would have had nine pressures allowed in 42 snaps in pass protection. The interior linemen fared better, allowing just two hurries between the three of them. The Giants once again struggled to run the ball, gaining just 42 yards on 14 carries, with 25 yards coming after contact.

146,"&gt; but the bigger question is why didn’t the Giants coaching staff relieve Wade of his duties when it was painfully obvious he was being picked on?

They don't have anybody better.  That's why Wade was the fifth-string CB in the first place

&gt; Leon Hall has arguably been the second best corner on the team

No.  He isn't.  He is very clearly inferior to the other three players ahead of him.  He is a flyweight, who only looks like a welterweight because he's being matched up against the other teams 4th string receivers.  That, and he's only playing a fraction of the downs a starter would play, which is pretty good for a guy on the wrong side of 30.  I'm not even sure if the Giants want him to play corner.  I think the Giants wanted him to go Charles Woodson and provide depth at safety.  (Which they likewise lack.)

The Giants didn't have any other options.  As much as I would like to set McAdoo on fire, the choice of cornerback wasn't the problem.  Maybe they gameplan to hide a clearly overmatched player, but the larger issue is that the team is currently sporting an overmatched player on the roster.  Competent teams make sure they have sufficient depth so they need never play that guy.  *Good* teams have sufficient depth, **and** they put that guy on the practice squad, which is where guys who can't play are supposed to learn.",2016-10-05 21:13:13+00:00,d8fkkea,1.0,t3_55zmmq,25527.0,NYGiants

148,"I have this conversation every couple of weeks on this forum.  Staying healthy is a skill.  I repeat: *Staying healthy is a skill.*  And it's a skill the players we draft and sign in free agency *lack*, because Jerry Reese doesn't understand that.

Prince Amukamara, Marvin Austin, Jerrel Jernigan, David Wilson, Jayron Hosley, Johnathan Hankins, Ereck Flowers (his excuse for sucking last year was injuries), Nat Behre, Eli Apple, and Darian Thompson.  You want to know what happened to all our other safeties over the past few years?  Cooper Taylor, Mykkele Thompson, injuries.

The returns from free agent signings aren't any more encouraging:

Rashad Jennings has missed 7 games in 3 years and when playing the best thing you can say about him is he doesn't fumble.  Shane Vereen played sparingly last year and can't hold onto the ball.  And he's out for the year.  Marshall Newhouse is bad when healthy and not currently healthy, forcing the Giants to play the execrable Bobby Hart.  Dwayne Harris is as close as it comes to a good signing, until you remember the contract is for $17M, $7M guaranteed.  For a kick returner!  Geoff Schwartz and JD Walter were unmitigated disasters who were never healthy, and Walter Thurmond signed a 1-year deal and then spent the entirety of it injured.  No, up until this year's offseason, (and the verdict is out on that, though 1 measly sack in 4 games is not a good start for Vernon) we've had all of *one* single hit in free agency.  You know who?  I'll give you three hints:

* His name starts with R
* His name rhymes with Glodgers-Crowmartie
* He was injured for this last game, something that tends to happen with increasing frequency with 30-year old football players.

I'm sorry I also forgot the *Pièce De Résistance* of shitty, free agent signings that ignore injury history because, strictly speaking, the Giants **re**-signed him.  The PLATONIC IDEAL of a dumb free agent signing:

Jon Beason

3 years, $16.8M.  $6M guaranteed.  Played 9 out of as possible 32 games over two years before being released.  I'm no cap expert, but I think the Giants are currently paying $2M of their cap on Jon Beason's contract.  $6M guaranteed.  My question is who, exactly, was offering to guarantee $5M?

All this spells out a pattern, at least to my eye.  Reese can't draft, at least he can't draft *well*, so he attempts to build a team with FA signings.  But paying $17M for a kick returner isn't how you win football games.  Neither is giving more guaranteed money than JJ Watt, got to a defensive end who can't actually get sacks.  Free agents are too expensive to build a team around in a salary cap league.  For every DRC he finds, he ends up with three Geoff Schwartzes.",2016-10-05 00:29:51+00:00,d8ebsan,6.0,t1_d8e6lck,7548.0,NYGiants

Going into this game the Vikings were one of the very few teams in the league with a *worse* offense than the Giants', ranked I think 31st out of 32 teams.  They averaged 17 points a game over the first 3 games of the season.

The Giants didn't **hold them** to 24 points, the Giants **got burned** for 24 points.  I mean am I the only person who remembers that Sam Bradford sucks?

We agree about the offense though.  They are terrible.  Injuries are murdering the offense as well.  Bobby Hart does not belong on an NFL field, ever.

162,"OK, here's the simplest solution for you, and probably the best one.  It's based upon two assumptions:

1. You're not making shit in salary right now.  You're not even 18, so chances are your income this year, including the $20,000, is going to be oh, **about $20,000**.

2. You don't know what you're going to do with the money.  You might want to go to college.  You might want to buy a house 15 years from now.  You might (almost certainly *will*) want to retire 48 years from now.  The solution I'm proposing allows you to do any of the above with that money.

What you should do is open up an investment account, putting the money into an **S&amp;P 500 Index Fund**.  There are plenty of online investment banks that will let you do this.  I suggest [Vanguard](https://investor.vanguard.com/home/) because their fees are extremely low but if you prefer TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, eTrade, or Merrill Edge, none of those are bad options, either.

You go to the web site, open an account, and fund it with $17,000 from the $20,000.  Keep the other $3,000 in your account.  You're (probably) going to need it come April.  Then you purchase stock from one of the *ETF's* (**E**xchange **T**raded **F**unds) that represents the [S&amp;P 500](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundIntExt=INT&amp;FundId=0968), or the [entire stock market](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundIntExt=INT&amp;FundId=0970).

Then, when tax season comes around, (you did set aside $3,000, right?) in March of 2017, take the paperwork for how you got the $20K, and all your tax information to an accountant.  Or your parents' accountant.  I have no idea how you ended up with this $20,000 so I can't tell you whether or not you're responsible for the taxes on it or if it's tax-free money.  And rather than try to give you (shitty) tax advice over a message board, I strongly suggest you go to an accountant who is willing to be responsible for your tax return.  'Cuz I'm not.  It's entirely possible the accountant will say ""Don't worry, you don't owe any taxes on this money"".  In which case great!  You're now $3,000 richer.

That's my whole advice.  You've put your money into an excellent ETF with extremely low fees, and you're taking advantage of capital appreciation in the stock market.  And the best part is you're starting very early in your life.  Later on you'll have the freedom, if you want, to use that money for a car, house, college education, or rolling it into a Roth IRA, but for now you probably don't know or care what that last thing even is, so don't worry about it.

Just a couple of other things I should mention to you:

1. Don't worry about what the market is doing at any given time.  You're 17 years old.  That means you're probably 2 years away from going to school, 13 years away from buying a house and 48+ years away from retirement.  What do you care if Microsoft is up 0.13% today?

2. Don't, don't, DON'T buy individual stocks.  It's the WORST thing you could do.  There's a reason mechadragon469's comment is being downvoted into oblivio, because it's TERRIBLE fucking advice!  It doesn't matter how much you like any one company, please take my word for it: Investing in a single stock is madness.  Scientists could discover proof that iPhones give you cancer and that Apple stock you just bought could evaporate like a fart in the wind.  When you invest in the entire market you're inured so that kind of volatility.

3. Don't buy mutual funds.  At least not ordinary mutual funds.  Buy ETFs.  The difference between ETFs and mutual funds is quite simple:  ETFs are not managed.  The stocks are chosen at the inception of the fund, and with very few and rare exceptions, they don't change over the life of the fund.  A mutual fund is actively managed.  There's some smart fellow in a tie that buys certain stocks, and decides which stocks to add or remove from the portfolio.  ""But wait!"" you might ask: ""Isn't that better?""  The dirty little secret of investing is **no, it's not better**.  It's actually worse.

The problem is, the market is really, *really* good at valuing a stock.  The market is so good, in fact, that it's almost impossible to actually beat the market.  And that smart guy in a tie I mentioned earlier?  He's not actually better at beating the market than anyone is.  In any given year, about half the mutual funds on the market will actually *underperform* the S&amp;P 500, while the other half will *overperform*!  Now, sometimes you'll 

But you know what DOES matter a great deal?  FEES.  Fees, fees fees.  Fees will eat you the fuck up.  They will drink your milkshake.  And fees are easily avoided, because they come from adding and removing stocks from a mutual fund, from all the trading commissions that those fund managers rack up.  The industry average for mutual fund fees are 1.25%.  By comparison the fees on those Vanguard funds I linked above?  0.05%.  Look at it this way:  If you take 20,000 and you invest it in the S&amp;P 500, which over the past 20 years has been returning ~7.5%, then in 20 years it would be $85,000.  But if you invested it in a mutual fund that matched the S&amp;P 500 performance, only with 1.5% in annual fees, you'd only be ending up with $64,000.

To avoid them, you don't go with actively managed mutual funds.  You just pick some sensible ETF, which should act as a proxy for the entire stock market, and dump all of your $17K in it.  You now have a diversified portfolio of the entire market, at virtually no cost in fees.",2016-10-01 20:40:00+00:00,d89ypnv,1.0,t3_55cbfm,46364.0,personalfinance

166,"That's not the way to look at it, for a variety of reasons.

First, the fact that you're paying mostly interest the first few years of a mortgage term doesn't mean you're throwing away your money.  You're **buying** money today (well, the day you close on the house) by paying a premium with the money you pay for it with tomorrow.  $1 today is worth more than $1 20 years from now.  Yes, you're paying $5 over the next 30 years for $1 today, but it's worth it.  The dollar today *is worth more*.

Second, it's possible the house appreciates in value *faster* than you're paying interest.

Third, the interest you're paying is actually discounted by your tax bracket.  That is to say, if you're in, say, the 35% tax bracket, and you have $1000 worth of interest, well that gets deducted from your income.  So really you're only paying $650 worth of interest.

Fourth, remember this isn't 2006, so you're talking about what is probably a ""sane"" mortgage.  That means a garden-variety 30-year term, 20% down, no ARM, no interest-only period, no *negative-amortizing-ARM* bullshit.

In particular, the 20% down means that you've already ponied up 20% of the value of the house.  So if your home appreciates by 10% in the first 5 years of your mortgage, even though you're paying a large amount in interest, you're still banking 10% appreciation on the 20% of equity you have in the house.  (2%)  There's an old saying, that I read in *The Big Short*.  It goes like this:

&gt; A Home Without Equity is Just a Rental with Debt

Which brings us to my final point: You're comparing owning a home to the vacuum.  That's not appropriate.  What, exactly, is your *alternative* to owning a home?  That's not a rhetorical question, there is usually exactly one alternative:  RENTING.  So really you're comparing gradually accumulating equity in a home vs. rent, which is, at least in the context of cash flow, just setting fire to your money month after month.  So unless you're comfortable living with Mom and Dad for the next 30 years you probably need to comparing buying a home to renting a home, rather than the void.  Or being a hobo, I suppose.

And the left-most lane goes infinitesimally faster than the other two as you approach that junction.

When there's some motorist who's in that lane, and then at the last minute they STOP COMPLETELY, to merge into the middle lane, because they're actually headed to Jersey?

189,"&gt; Outside of the one facemask penalty, Jenkins exceeded my expectations. Most importantly, he was on the field the ENTIRE game. Every defensive snap. If I read that about Amukamara, I'd be looking forward to the inevitable report that his legs had fallen off after the game and he'd be missing 7 weeks.

I agree.  I forgot to add this in the original post I made, under bullet #10, that Collins lost credit for a beautiful blitz that was erased by that infuriating facemask.  As for being on the field, it's nice, huh?  Actually having a player who *plays*?  Somewhere the ACLs of Geoff Schwarz, Johnathan Hankins, and Prince Amukamara are turning over in their graves.

I agree with nearly everything else you said.  Scoring 20 against Dallas terrible, suspension-depleted defense is subpar.  Except for the interception: Rewatching that play, it's more Flowers than anyone else.  How can you blame the WR for not cutting off his route when they're not actually blitzing?  They're just rushing 4 into bad blocking?

Then again, maybe I'm full of shit.  I found the play online:

https://vine.co/v/5JIlKbPE93t

That looks like 5 rushers, and Flowers was 1-on-1 against the DE, and the LB or a safety came in unblocked.  In that case it's on the RB and the WR.  And the QB :(

There's no need to blame Flowers for plays he didn't screw up.  He screws up so many, it's a target-rich environment.

192,"Here's my read on the performance, FWIW.  Anybody who frequents this forum knows I have a low opinion of current NYG management, so I may skew a bit dark, here.

1. If Romo were healthy we'd be 0-1 right now.  Then again, if Tony Romo were healthy all the time and never ever injured his name would be *Eli Manning*.

2. Among the FA acquisitions, Vernon and Jenkins looked pretty good, Harrison less so.  Snacks had the only opportunity to sack Prescott, hit him, and then slid off meekly.  No idea what was going on there.  Vernon continuing to get zero sacks and all the peripherals instead is good news/bad news.  We need him to get sacks, but holding penalties are nearly as good.

3. I didn't see JPP do very much.  Defensive line play, however, is very hard to judge.  You need a DVR and an uninterrupted 2 hours to go through all the plays, and it's very hard to distinguish JPP being bad with Dallas's o-line being good.  I hope it's the latter.  Overall the D-line generated a lot of pressure, so perhaps I'm being too harsh.

4. Vereen &gt;&gt; Jennings.  Vereen, despite the one drop, was very good when he had the ball, and Rashad Jennings?  Not so much.  Frankly, Jenning's day was a complete washout until the 4th quarter, when he had some good-looking runs to (almost) run out the clock.  But I re-watched those runs.  They were more the offensive line finally opening up very big holes, rather than Jennings doing anything good.  And that final 10-yard run which came 2 yards short  of ending the game?  Jennings went untouched until that safety hit him after gaining 10 yards.  If he falls forward from the spot he gets hit, the end of that game is three knees.  Instead it was WAY too interesting.

5. Shepard was mediocre.  Aside from the early touchdown, he only caught 2 other balls.  In addition to being (at least partially) responsible for the Eli interception, he also committed one of those weird penalties - I think illegal formation- that you pretty much never ever see.  Weird penalties usually mean some rookie screw-up.

6. Speaking of the interception, guess where the pressure came from on that play!  If you said ""Ereck Flowers"" then you did a better job of paying attention than he did on that play, trying to double-up blocking on a guy Pugh had handled.  Instead he ignored the rushing Mayowa, who came right at Eli unblocked.  Flowers gave up, by PFF's count, 5 pressures including the lone sack.  I think his days of trying to get Eli Manning killed are [coming to a middle](https://vine.co/v/5JTW5KP7jdE).

7. Whoever was covering Dez Bryant was doing a hell of a job.  Did you hear his name being called much in that game?  There was the pass he dropped in the end zone (so familiar - such a shame) and there was that pass that was nearly intercepted, and that's about it.  I didn't notice if it was DRC or JJ, or some two-headed combination of the two?  Whatever it was we should do that again in game 2 vs. them.  It worked.

8. Whoever was covering Cole Beasly was... not good.  I don't know if it was Apple, or a linebacker, but whomever it was they couldn't stop him from finding holes in the zone, which should be harder when we're *not fucking playing zone*.

9. OBJ was kind of disappointing.  He was facing one of the worst defenses in the league.  Remember last year, when we had one of the worst defenses in the league?  Remember what Calvin Johnson did to us?

10. Landon Collins was shockingly adequate.  Best game he's ever played as a Giant, not that the bar was set very high.


One other thing.  I was very very reluctant to get too excited about the Giants FA acquisitions this offseason because that's not how winners are made:  Nobody ever buys their way to a championship in the NFL.  Remember Daniel Snyder's first few years owning the Washington football franchise?  There's a zillion reasons why this is: You are getting a player who's never ever going to outperform his contract; the best he can do is live up to it, and you're getting a guy where often the team letting him go knows more than you do, and you're trying to shoehorn a guy into an alien system and crossing your fingers that it works.  I would always prefer to get two or three day two and day three FA's, guys who still have room to improve, and who can surprise you.  Like Seattle found with Bennett (the first time), or Kansas City found with Geoff Schwarz (before we signed him and he went back to bad.)  My point is FA acquisitions are usually more like Rashad Jennings:  Not nearly good enough for the price you pay.

But amazingly, we got three relatively positive performances from three big FA acquisitions in game 1.  That's very unlikely!  Maybe the Giants have Forrest Gumped their way to a Free Agency unicorn.",2016-09-12 21:15:12+00:00,d7k3hxa,1.0,t3_52fbzo,15691.0,NYGiants

Did he ""pass the eye test"" because he was wearing a Dallas uniform?  Or because he was pretty tall and not fat, and he ran fast?  Perhaps you thought he ""looked the part"".  Here's my ""eye test"", for whatever it's worth, let's see if I can make it mean something: His running sucked.  He didn't make guys miss, and he kept trying to run over defenders.  And it didn't work.  That's how you end up with 2.55 yards per carry.

I  should take this opportunity to point out that Elliott needs to [""take things one game at a time,"" that he's ""just trying to help the team"".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JzfJaHjcx8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=21s)

&gt; I agree that it was a reach but even if he doesn't live up to the 4th pick (most players don't),

The aggregate of all the players drafted at #4 **defines** the value of the #4 pick.  Saying ""most players don't"" live up to that makes no sense to me.  I'd imagine about half of those guys outperform the average #4 pick, and half underperform.  It's the aggregate of Cooper and Watkins and Johnson and Kalil and all the others that tells you what the #4 pick is worth.

How about this: Let's stop pretending to be announcers, shall we?  Those guys aren't actually in the business of informing the people watching of what's going on in the game.  They're in the business of converting oxygen into carbon dioxide while we wait for the next play to get set.

You think he did a good job blocking.  I'm not sure how impressed I really need to be over that, but it seems like you actually *watched* the game when you say things like that.  At least you're telling me something.  I've got the game on DVR, and I'm going to watch it again tonight, in hopes of seeing something regarding the guy's blocking.  I'll consider it my homework assignment.

What he flashed was one positive run the whole game.  One.  The touchdown in the third quarter.  (I think it was the 3rd.)

The rest of the time?  He was running directly into the defenders, trying (and failing) to run them over.  Top marks for being a tough guy.  No marks for being productive.  And that description is consistent with Ron Dayne with a better pedigree.

196,"Yes.  Precisely.

And it's even worse than the #4 pick, really.  He could be argued to be the #2 pick, if you want to look at it this way:

The first two picks don't count because nobody's arguing that those two QBs are the two best players in the draft.  Those picks are forced by virtue of the outsized impact a quarterback has on his team's chances to win.  I mean, no sane person would ever argue that, say, Andrew Luck is as good at his job as JJ Watt, Khalil Mack, Aaron Donald, or Antonio Brown are at their jobs.  Watt's the best player in the NFL, and Donald, Mack &amp; Brown are each the best players at their respective positions by large margins but if you re-draft the entire NFL, every GM in the league drafts Luck long before they look at any of those guys.  Shit, I think you take 8 guys, including Eli, before you look at Watt.

So if you don't count the sad, desperate attempts to *fiat* a franchise quarterback with the top 2 picks, (and Goff's stock is already down - did you see that guy on Hard Knocks?  Ugh.) then he's the #2 overall pick, at least when picked by true talent level instead of ""We need a QB or we're screwed"".",2016-09-12 19:40:36+00:00,d7jyxrr,3.0,t1_d7jxy4e,1222.0,NYGiants

Of course, riddle me this:  What ever happened to Marvin Austin?  The guy got released by the Giants after 2 years.  Where's he playing now?  What coach went out and turned him into a useful player, something that Coughlin couldn't do?  How about Jernell Jernigan?  Out of the league in four years, never signed by anyone.  How about David Wilson?  How about my personal favorite, Damontre Moore?  Unemployed right now.

If Coughlin were really that bad there'd be a string of guys who he couldn't teach, who caught on elsewhere.  But there aren't.  There's just a bunch of guys who could never play in the first place.

I just watched him on the first series during the second half, after the starters left and he got a chance to show what he could do.  Here's what he did:

1st play he missed a block on an Andre Williams 12 yard run.  Didn't end up mattering because the guy ran through the wrong hole and missed him.  Or maybe Williams made him miss.  Either way, the play succeeded *despite* Hart, not because of him.

2nd play he lines up in the wrong spot and gets the Giants a penalty.  I've seen that penalty maybe three times in my *life*.  Probably that's because I tend to watch **professional** football.

3rd play (now 1st and 15) Hart gives up a sack.  The refs clean up his shit by calling a roughing the passer penalty.

4th play they run directly behind Hart.  Maybe he's not terrible at blo- no, he's terrible at blocking as well. The Bills player he's blocking sheds the block, makes the tackle.  But that's not the best part of the play.  Hart gets pushed into a Bills DT, and finishes the play clutching at his hamstring.  That's the bit that makes it **ART**.

At that point I walked away, gorge rising.  I never thought I'd see a more hopelessly incompetent tackle than Ereck Flowers in 2015, but I was wrong:  Bobby Hart is equal to that challenge.

That's not even a full season of production.  It is not possible to conclude anything about what he might have been, except to be certain that he's not going to be a damn thing any more, because just like all of Jerry Reese's other picks, he is injured.

As for the rest of these players, stop making excuses for them.  That's not being a Giants fan, that's being delusional.  Those guys sucked.  They sucked when they were healthy and they sucked when they were injured, which was often.  Damontre Moore even found a third axis to suck on, the *lunatic headcase* axis, where he got into fights and accumulated penalties without actually producing anything.  And the guy responsible for drafting them is, bafflingly, still with the team, still running things.  Maybe Reese will turn his incompetent drafting around.  Maybe Eli Apple was secretly a brilliant pick and nobody's going to miss having Tunsil installed at LT for the next decade.

Or maybe Ereck Flowers is going to do everything in his power to get Eli Manning *killed* next season.  After all, that's precisely what he did last year.

Did you read that article about Eli Manning's excellent 2015, mucked up by mediocre supporting players?  It's [here](http://www.footballoutsiders.com/film-room/2016/film-room-eli-manning).  Here's my favorite line from the article, written after a series of excellent throws by Eli Manning are marred by Andre Williams:

&gt; A competent receiving back catches this ball and turns upfield for at least 4 yards. A good one gets the first down. Williams is neither, so the Giants are put into a third-and-9 situation despite their quarterback making the perfect read and the perfect throw for the situation.

Reading that line, I am inspired to describe Jerry Reese's first round pick at 10:

&gt; A competent GM trades down 10 spots and still gets Eli Apple at 20, along with a second round pick in 2018.  A *good one* snatches up Laremy Tunsil, who may very well have been the best player in the 2016 draft.  Jerry Reese is neither, so the Giants have spent the past two months bemoaning their ""bad luck"" in the draft.

Nothing *happened* to Jerry Reese in this draft.  *Jerry Reese happened*.

Everybody.  Everybody cares where the other teams thought he would go.  If you pick a second round talent in the first round then you've fucked up because you could've gotten him in the second round instead.  If he'd go ten picks later then you trade down seven spots and still get your guy.  And if a GM can't do that, well then they're not competent.

Is that a sentence?  Austin failed to produce which is why he's unemployed right now.  He was injured THREE QUARTERS of the two years he played (using that word loosely) for the Giants.  Moore failed to produce and also committed too many penalties which is why he's unemployed right now.

It sounds an awful lot like the electrocution and the palsy were two different things, unrelated.

This is really, really fucking simple.

A flight from New York to London today costs $1000 and takes 7 hours.

A flight from New York to London in ~1980 cost $1000 and took 3.5 hours.  Converting $1000 from 1980 dollars to 2016 dollars means it actually costed $3000 dollars back then.

So, you can pay $2000 extra to save 3.5 hours.  How many people make &gt; $570/hr?  That translates to a salary of $1.18 million per year.

That's the Concorde market, people who're making so much fucking money, that they can actually justify spending $2000 just to save themselves three and a half hours.

I'm sure there's someone on this thread who'll argue that's not a reasonable way to calculate the market for this plane but gimme a break: It's a *back-of-the-envelope* calculation.  Is it perfect?  Probably not.  But if anything, it **over**estimates the market for the flights, if you argue that someone who makes a million dollars a year values his free time at somewhat less than his hourly wage.  Maybe you have to make *twice* that to actually justify taking the Concorde.  Fine.  That means the Concorde's reasonable market is now at people making $2.36 million!

Regardless of how one calculates the marginal cost of taking a Concorde, it's obviously in the *ballpark* of the extraordinarily high-earners, which makes that market extremely small.

1. Your stat has *massive* selection bias. You should be displaying sacks per passing attempt, not sacks per game.  The Panthers, Bills and Seahawks led the league in rushing attempts, all rushing the ball &gt;500+ times.  Should they get a bonus because they don't even *try* to pass the ball?

2. Your stat has *ever-yet-still-more* selection bias.  You know what Phillip Rivers and Tom Brady have in common?  They play on teams that throw more than the Giants.  Though, to be fair, Roethlisberger does not.  The Steelers are behind the Giants in total pass attempts.  On the other hand, Roethlisberger is second in the league in Air Yards per passing attempt, which actually gives us a pretty good gauge of how deep he throws the ball, which is a proxy for how **long** he has to *hold onto* the ball.  (Though it's not a perfect one.  Air yards tracks yards *gained* on passes completed, not air yards attempted regardless of whether the pass is completed.  That stat is not publicly available, and I'm not paying for premium membership in PFF.)

As a lot of people in this thread have pointed out Manning gets rid of the ball very quickly, in part because of the McAdoo offense and in part because he's good at dumping the ball off before he gets sacked.  This is narrative and I can't support it with stats but it doesn't seem *totally crazy*.

I might respect what you have to say more if you added, at the end of each of these statements, ""I think.""  When you leave off the ""I think"" you sound like a moron.

But riddle me this, please:

* Andrus Peat, 13th pick overall in 2015, just finished a season as a top 20 tackle in his rookie year.

* Jeff Otah was above average in 2008, his rookie year and then got progressively worse.  Curious, I thought it was going to take him 3 years.  Was he somehow coming from a more complex system in college?  Were there differential equations in *his* blocking scheme?  Same goes for Michael Oher and Matt Kalil.  Well, Kalil at least.  Oher wasn't above average in his rookie year.  He was *much much better* than that. I guess they were all made of magic.  *Evil* magic, of course.  Otherwise why are they getting worse after excellent rookie years?

* Joe Thomas was selected 3rd overall in 2007, and proceeded to make the pro bowl in his rookie year.  But that was probably a fluke.  It's not like he made the pro bowl every other year he's been in the league as well.  O wait he did.  Joe Thomas was excellent from day 1.  That probably proves you're actually RIGHT, in some nonsense way.

* Marshall Yonda rolled out of bed after being picked in the 3rd round, and OOPS, had one of the best rookie tackle seasons in history once they let him play.  But that probably shouldn't count.  If there's anything that says ""sure thing"" it's a third round pick.

* Tyron Smith was easily a top-10 right tackle in his rookie year for the Cowboys.  The very next year he was easily a top-10 **left** tackle after they moved him.

Your argument is not supported by history.

Though, I guess I can hardly blame you for believing that ""it takes 3 years"" for an OT to develop, even though EVERYBODY in the NFL appears to believe otherwise.  After all, if it DIDN'T take 3 years for a good OT to develop, Ereck Flowers wouldn't have any excuses at all after the *fuckfest* of his rookie year, would he?  He'd just be terrible at his job, end of story.  Admitting *that* is probably less palatable than making weird nonsense claims, huh?

I've got a much simpler point: The Giants had the [two worst tackles](https://www.profootballfocus.com/pro-ranking-all-32-offensive-lines-this-season/) in the league last year.  Hell, Flowers was so awful PFF ranked him 76th amongst all tackles.  That means he's not even the *backup* on 12 of those teams.

First and foremost, there's the *Presidential Veto*.  When the House &amp; Senate pass a law it goes to the President to be signed into law.  If the President refuses to do so it's called a *veto*.  The House &amp; Senate can *force* the bill into law with an *Override Vote* but that requires more than a majority, a 2/3 supermajority.  That's rare.

In fact a veto just happened a couple of weeks ago.  The Department of Labor issued a regulation requiring that anyone performing as an investment adviser act as a **fiduciary**, which [basically means they're required to act in your best interest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NOvbdgnwc8) if they make stock and investment recommendations.  Congress passed a law overriding that directive from the Department of Labor, and Obama vetoed it.

This dovetails nicely into power #2: An awful lot of non-elected posts exist in the government.  Most of them get appointed by the President of the United states.  One of the reasons the DoL issued that directive is because it came from guys Obama appointed.  They're executing plays Obama's in favor of.

Finally, and possibly the most importantly, the President is the **Commander in Chief** of the Armed Forces.  This means he issues the orders to the military.  There are various caveats to that, such as Congress having the ""power do declare war"", and the War Powers Act (which may or may not be constitutional), but in practice? In practice the President does precisely what he wants with the military and Congress can go fuck themselves.",2016-06-23 18:40:09+00:00,d4l54gg,1.0,t3_4pi7se,1053.0,explainlikeimfive

316,"OK, first of all we're talking about a *refinance*, at least in America.  I've never heard the term ""remortgage"" though it's quite accurate.

Let's say I buy a house, in 2011, five years ago.  The value of the house is, say, $200K, and I put down $40K in down payment.  That means that my mortgage is $160K, the difference between my down payment and the total value of the house.  I now own a $200K house, and I owe $160K to the bank.  My **net worth** is still just +$40K, just like before I bought the house.

Now let's say it's 2016, five years later.  In the course of paying off the mortgage over the past five years, I now only owe, say, $140K to the bank.  And good news!  My house has gone up in value to, say, $240K!  That means my net worth is now $100K.

But let's **also** say I've had two kids over the past 5 years.  Kids are fucking *expensive*.  Not only do they eat you out of house &amp; home, and their after-school activities are expensive, and their daycare is expensive, but after all that guess what?  They still need to go to college.  Each kid you spit out means you're now racing.  Racing against their 18th birthday.  If you've got a $300K saved up for their college educations by then, you win.  If you don't, your kid loses.  Have fun.

So all those expenses add up, and now that monthy payment you're making, of, say, $1100 a month to pay your mortgage?  It's getting harder and harder to make that number work, given all your other expenses.  So what do you do?  Well the daycare ain't going to charge you less just 'cuz you ask.  And Harvard isn't going to discount it's tuition because you ask nicely.  But you *can*, if you want, lower your monthly nut on your house.

You go to the bank, and you **refinance** your house.  That means you reset your mortgage, back to a 30-year mortgage.  So now instead of owing $140K with 25 years left to pay it all off, now you owe $140K with **30** years to pay it off, so your monthly payment goes from $1100 a month to $950 a month.  All it cost you was an additional 5 years of payments, and now you have an extra $150 a month for little Sterling's lacrosse practices!

And maybe, if you're lucky, you refinance at a time when interest rates are lower than when you originally financed the house.  So now you can pay 3.00% instead of 3.50% on your mortgage.  That'll save you a few bucks as well.  And because you have more *equity* in the house than when you got your original loan, the bank can consider you a safer investment and you can pay 2.95% instead of 3.00%.",2016-06-22 17:09:22+00:00,d4jllb9,1.0,t3_4pbe3e,4165.0,explainlikeimfive

326,"Injecting heroin requires that the user take a hypodermic needle and insert it into a vein.  That means it pokes a hole in the vein and pushes heroin into the vein through that hole.

Over time, that adds a lot of wear &amp; tear to the vein.  The vein will heal, eventually, but it will develop scar tissue making it harder to inject into again.  Of course, this is exacerbated by *frequent* injections:  Inject heroin once a year into the same vein?  You'll be just fine.  But the problem is heroin users are really bad at saying ""when""!  On top of all of that, heroin is bad for you. It suppresses the immune response, which makes health issues like vein scarring worse.

This is an issue for more than just heroin users. My mother is O-negative. She gives blood. A lot. (They LOVE her at the Red Cross.  Every 8 weeks, they call, make an appointment.  She's a rockstar.)  And even getting a needle into her arm that infrequently, she's started to get issues with her left arm's vein. So now they alternate.  Also when you go to the hospital they'll often fit you with a *peripheral venous catheter*.  It's basically a semi-permanent needle stuck into the back of your hand.  Why do they do that?  So they can inject you a dozen times without *sticking you* a dozen times.  It all goes into that one hollow needle and into your hand.

Anyway point is heroin users don't take nearly as good care of their veins, and they inject often, and they're often less skilled than the nurses at the Red Cross or a hospital.  So once they end up using up the veins in the crook of their elbows, they move on to other, less convenient veins, because they're still more convenient than doing without heroin.",2016-06-21 16:34:19+00:00,d4i5j05,1.0,t3_4p5e1u,1317.0,explainlikeimfive

328,"Assuming you're talking about an atom attracting electrons from *another atom*, and you're asking why the first atom only grabs electrons from the outer shell, the answer is those outer shell electrons are less tightly bound.  The two electrons in the 1s orbital are much more tightly bound to the nucleus than any of the 2 electrons in the 2s orbital, which are both more tightly bound than the 6 electrons of the 2p orbital.

This means long before the atom gets close enough to pull off an electron from the 1s orbital, it'll be *more than* close enough to exert enough pull to rip off an outer shell electron.

For example the binding energy for Sodium (Na) indicates it takes about 1,000 eV to kick the innermost electrons out of their orbits, ~60 eV to kick out on of the two 2s inner orbital electrons, and a mere ~31 eV to kick out any of the electrons in the 2p orbital:

The animals you've described in the above post are all wild animals.  While the typical pet is *domesticated*, every single one of the animals you mentioned above are not.  You're not allowed to have a wolf, but you are allowed to have a dog because humanity has spent the past thousand years breeding the undesirable traits out of wolves to make dogs (like biting the neighbor's kid, for instance), or out of lynxes, to make housecats.  The notion that most of these wild animals would make acceptable house pets is probably unrealistic.  Deer like to forage over multiple acres of forested land, for instance.

333,"First of all, interest rates on credit cards are usually slaved to the *Prime Rate* which is a rate published by banks that indicates what banks charge each other to borrow reserves.  The prime rate rarely changes more than once a month.  So your interest rate of 22% might actually be ""Prime plus 19%"", and the prime rate is 3.0% that month.

Secondly, no, you wouldn't owe $122.  You would owe about $101.83.  That's 22%, divided by 12 months.  Interest rates are always quoted as the annual rate.

I don't really know what your questions have to do with fixed vs. variable rates.  Can you be more specific about what you're asking?

[EDIT]

The number you're quoting here, the 22%, is probably your APR.  APR stands for **A**nnual **P**ercentage **R**ate.  And strictly speaking that's the interest rate you're being charged.  However, if you look carefully you'll see you actually pay slightly more over the course of the year.  Here, let's say you start with that $100 and let's see what happens if you accumulate 1.83% interest each month over 12 months:

Balance = $100 * ( 1.0183 )^12 = $124.31

""What, what the hell is that crap?!?"" you might ask.  Well you have to remember that the APR is calculated simply, by just taking a monthly rate and multiplying it by 12.  But that monthly rate does not add up simply like that.  The interest you get charged in month 1 gets **interest applied to IT**, during months 2-12!  Consider it like this.  On month 1 you get charge $1.83 in interest for that month.  Over the course of the next 11 months you will get charged an *additional* $0.40 because of *interest on the interest*.  You get charged a little less interest on month 2's interest, and a little less than that on month 3's interest, and once you're done adding it all up, you get charged an additional $2.31.

The *effective* interest rate you pay over the course of a year isn't the APR, it's the APY.  (**A**nnual **P**ercentage **Y**ield)  In the case above, your APR would be 22%, but your APY would be 24.3%.

Why don't credit card companies talk about this?  Because they like to lie.  It's an opportunity for them to lie, just a little bit, about how onerous their interest rates are.  It's a little bit scummy, but who're we kidding?  They're credit card companies.  They charge exorbitant interest rates and try to bury their customers in fees, sending them into perpetual, permanent debt.  They're already a lot scummy, so being a little *more* scummy is incidental.

Not really.  Nobody talks about XX-karat gold in the context of a gold bar.  As I mentioned before, there are sometimes good and proper reasons to significantly adulterate the amount of gold in *jewelry*, which is where the karat system comes from.  For example:

* 22 karat gold - This is almost exactly like 24-karat gold, at least in luster and color.  But you can add just enough alloyed metals like nickle, silver, and copper to make it a lot harder and more durable.

* 20 karat gold - This is what white gold is made out of, at least one formulation, 90% gold and 10% nickel.

It's not a matter of the karat system being used to tell us how pure the gold is.  It hardly matters if the gold is 99% or 99.999% pure.  It's much more practical.  It tells you how much of actual gold is in your jewelry, tells you what allow the jewelry is made out of, and in the event that you ever have to sell it, it tells you what fraction of the metal is actual gold, and what fraction is (relatively worthless) adulterates.",2016-06-20 18:09:28+00:00,d4gx2kg,3.0,t1_d4gwccv,946.0,explainlikeimfive

370,"They don't stop. Not exactly.

First of all keep in mind the ""silicon burning"" process that produces ^52 Fe doesn't *just* produce iron. It also produces ^56 Ni and ^60 Zn. This is because it's not a simple fusion process, like, say, the proton-proton chain, which is what generates most of the helium our sun produces. It doesn't randomly generate much lithium or beryllium; Proton-proton *only* produces helium.

By contract, silicon burning consists overwhelmingly of silicon and other heavy nuclei being bombarded with alpha particles, which are produces from these same nuclei disintegrating from the environment. You can keep bombarding each of these ""ashes"" with alphas and you'll end up producing heavier and heavier elements.

The reason why the fusion chain stops at iron is that at that point the process is not exothermic. Specifically, the reaction:

^56 Ni + ^4 α --&gt; ^60 Zn

This reaction *loses energy*.

So instead of holding back the collapse of the star, fusing the heavier elements produced in the ""ash"" of fusing iron actually *accelerates* the collapse. This is how you get elements even heavier than ^62 Ni; They are produced during the few seconds of the catastrophic implosion in a type II supernova. This is also why you don't get very much of them: Because you only have a few seconds to undergo the fusion before the star implodes, ejecting the majority of it's mass out into the cosmos and leaving behind just a neutron star or black hole.",2016-06-13 16:33:20+00:00,d47h7rk,1.0,t3_4nw4es,4137.0,askscience

375,"OK, well this is a much more complicated question.  In fact it's two questions.

There are several extremely hard, unanswered questions in contemporary physics today.  They represent the great unanswered questions of our day.  And two of them are these questions:

1. Where and what is all the dark matter?  The universe isn't expanding as fast as it should because there's this extra mass, slowing down the expansion with it's gravity.  We don't know what's contributing the mass, and we don't know where whatever it is, is.  This is dark matter.  We don't think it interacts via the three other forces besides gravity (strong, weak, electromagnetic) the way the rest of matter does, which is why we can't ""see"" it, we can only see the effects of it's gravity.  Hence the name, ""dark matter"".

2. Why are we made of ordinary matter at all?  This is a more profound question from the big bang.  Originally the universe was nothing but a point, right?  And the big bang barfed out all sorts of matter &amp; expansion &amp; energy.  WHY did the big bang produce SO MUCH MORE regular matter (electrons, protons, neutrons, and neutrinos) and SO LITTLE antimatter (positrons, antiprotons, antineutrons, and antineutrinos?)  Because at this point, there's basically NO antimatter left in the universe.  It's all annihilated against the shitloads of regular matter, and since there's so much more regular matter, that's all we're left with.  But there's no REASON why there would be such an asymmetry in the production of regular and anti-matter.  At least, no reason in our current models that we can account for.

So this dark matter signal gives us a data point into the investigations of both questions.  Where is this antimatter coming from?  Maybe dark matter.  How is dark matter producing it?  Shit, we don't know.  It's DARK MATTER.  It's a frigging mystery.  We can barely discern it's presence from indirect means like this *ever-so-slight* [surplus of positrons](http://www.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/AMS_PAMELA_Fermi_341px.jpg).  And why is it producing antimatter?  That's a tantalizing data point.  Maybe the physics of dark matter **also** explains why there's a deficit of antimatter.  (Or maybe not.  We're in uncharted waters right now, where there be dragons.  There are only questions, no hard answers.)

So no, RedditsUniverse, you're not likely to get a straight answer to your question because we don't know how these positrons are being created.  We don't know why and we don't know how.  But we know there's a discrepancy in the data, and that sort of stuff can sometimes mean there's a physical law or process that we don't entirely understand yet, that's behind it.  That's why this is exciting.  It's new data, data that doesn't fit perfectly with the old dull models.  New data that may some day mean new theories, which may some day mean a new model for the universe we live in.

There's no simple answer to your question, but that's actually a good thing.  It means there are more things to learn.",2016-06-11 02:13:15+00:00,d44fzj3,5.0,t1_d44am68,9652.0,explainlikeimfive
376,"OK well, I don't know how you could ""create an excess amount of positrons in an object"".  I suppose you could take a cannister of garden-variety hydrogen and shoot it with a positron beam from a collider.

But that wouldn't really do much to the electrons in the hydrogen atoms, at least their orbitals.  It might cause a few of them to annihilate against the positrons, but in a big sea of hydrogen you're not likely to perturb the orbits of the electrons, because ultimately, hydrogen is neutral.  It's neither attracted to nor repelled by positrons or any other charged particles.

 To *excite* an electron you need a photon.

Now, if we postulate that this positron ends up real close to the electron in the atom, well, they will self-annihilate with each other.  That should result in, I think a pair of photons being emitted in opposite directions.  At that point you'll have a naked proton floating around, AKA an ion, like what you see in acids and salts.  (The H in HCl, for example.  The singleton proton from the H floats around in the solution of water, while the Cl enjoys the electron it stole from the H atom, loving it's full electron shell.)  But that's getting us close to chemistry rather than physics.",2016-06-10 23:27:11+00:00,d44afye,3.0,t1_d44a51p,536.0,explainlikeimfive
377,"This is a tricky question because you're not being super-clear on what gets *excited* by a light wave.  Are you talking about a ""naked"" electron, just sitting out there, struck by a photon?  Because that's not really a thing.

If, on the other hand, you're talking about an electron in an atom, being ""excited"" up to a higher energy orbital, then we can consider the converse with a positron.

An electron orbits the nucleus of, say, a hydrogen atom because they are attracted to each other due to coulomb forces.  The electron is negative and the proton is positive.

By the same token, a positron in an anti-hydrogen atom orbits the nucleus (an anti-proton) likewise because the unlike charges attract each other.

In both cases, going to a higher energy orbital (which can *very roughly, and inadequately* be imagined by an orbit further away from the nucleus) results in a higher energy state, which we describe by saying the ""electron is excited to a higher energy state"".  But really, it's the whole atom which is excited.

But either way, the electron or the positron is storing that energy in it's excited orbital.  It doesn't matter that one of those particles (and atoms, for that matter) is ""antimatter"".  The energy is not negative just because it's antimatter.

This is the case for all instances of ""real"" antimatter, cases where we're actually talking about matter that exists and continues to exist.  There's such a thing as ""virtual particles"" where a particle-antiparticle pair will blink into existence for no particular reason, which is permitted by quantum mechanics provided they don't live very long.  

They will eventually self-annihilate with each other, and because one of the particles has ""negative energy"" and the other has an exactly equal ""positive energy"" they annihilate to nothing at all.  By convention, we assume the ordinary matter particle has positive energy and the antimatter particle has negative energy.  But that's not a meaningful thing.  It could easily go the opposite way.  Since the particles almost always self-annihilate (it takes the surface of a *black hole* to pull them apart) it never matters.

Plus this is not what you're describing above.  Above, you're thinking antiparticles have negative energy in their orbitals, which they do not.",2016-06-10 23:14:57+00:00,d44a12f,1.0,t3_4nix6s,1126.0,explainlikeimfive

It's that our brains and our memories register time with life experiences.  Milestones.  So you passed more milestones when you were a kid, and since your brain remembers those, it catalogs the amount of time that passed roughly as the number of milestones of which there are lots more when you're a child (first words, first step, first day at school, first day of high school, first girlfriend, etc. etc...) vs. when you're an adult.

379,"This is a lot of questions.  Let's go individually:

&gt; What does it Refinance of a house mean?

Refinance of a house, (or a car, or a boat, or anything else you've got a loan on) means you take out a SECOND loan against whatever you've got the loan on.  The second loan is used to pay off the first loan, and then you're left with only the second loan.  So if you take out, say, a $400K loan on a $500K house, and then after a few years you now owe $300K on that house, you can refinance the remaining $300K you owe.  You start a new loan on the $300K you owe on the house, and you being with those payments.


&gt;  If I have a 30 year house loan and into year 15 when refinanced does that mean it starts the 30 year over again?

Often, that's precisely what it means.  However nobody's holding a gun to your head to refinance with another 30-year.  You could refinance with a 20-year, or a 10-year loan.  Or whatever you might feel like getting.  You could refinance 15 years into a 30-year loan and end up with a 10-year loan, shortening your total loan by 5 years.  Of course, that's not a hell of a lot better than just spending those last 10 years paying off your 30-year loan faster, and there are reasons why you might just want to choose one option over the other.  We'll get to those in a second.


&gt; How do the lenders benefits from this smaller interest rate?

They don't, if you have the same lender both times.  Shit, most of the time the lender won't agree to a refi like that.  But if your first mortgage is from Chase, and your refinance is from Wells Fargo, then Wells Fargo won't feel the least bit bad about stealing revenue &amp; business from Chase.  So they benefit by competing in the marketplace.


&gt; Because I am sure they don't want you to pay them less.

As I said above, they're happy to steal business from a competitor.  Plus there's a catch.


&gt; So what's the catch?

The catch is two things:

* In practice, almost nobody ever refinances to shorten or even maintain their loan length.  Almost nobody ever refinances from *15-years-left-on-a-30-year* to a *15-year*.  It's not **disallowed** by any means, and it's not unheard of, but in the real world the vast majority of refinances are from someone 4-8 years into a 30-year loan who then resets it to another 30 years, in the process lowering their monthly payments.  Like, say, a family that just spat out their 2nd kid and is realizing paying for college for a second kid is *fucking expensive*.  And you know what?  The banks LOVE this!  (Hey look, I can be one of those clickbait scumbags:  Banks HATE this one weird trick to grow your penis!)  This means you're in debt to them for longer, it means they can charge you interest for longer; It's like you paying the minimum on your credit card.  Being in permanent debt to a bank means they're making money off you forever.  There's no free lunches in this world.  If the bank offers you terms that reduce your payments, that means you're being charged interest for longer &amp; they're making their money back even more.

* The other catch is refinancing a loan isn't free.  There are fees and points that go with refinancing, just like the original loan.  And that's thousands of dollars that are going to the bank immediately, with no waiting.  Those points and fees **functionally** increase your interest rate.  For example, if your bank is charging you 3 points on a 30-year loan, they're *essentially* charging you an effective interest rate of 0.1% more.  Basically.  The math is a little more complicated than that because $1 today paid in points is worth more than $1 paid 30 years from now.  This is referred to as churn.  The more times they can get you to refinance your loan, the more opportunities they have to charge you points and fees.",2016-06-10 22:42:42+00:00,d448wzg,1.0,t3_4nisf9,1150.0,explainlikeimfive

Basically Alice and Bob pick two numbers apiece.  One is known as the *public key* and Alice sends hers to Bob, and Bob sends his to Alice.  The other is known as the *private key* and neither of them exchange the private key.

The catch, though, is that because of the way these numbers are chosen, and the constraints placed on the numbers, and a couple of tricks of modulus arithmetic, they can exchange only their public keys and a public (and harmless) agreed-upon modulus base, and with that information, Alice is able to generate a number using Bob's public key, and Bob is able to generate a number using Alice's public key, and **those numbers will match**.

Despite the number they use never having been transmitted in the open, the secret number Alice &amp; Bob generate match.  With that, they can start encrypting their communication using the shared secret.  This is also known as *public key cryptography*, and it is the basis for all banking and commerce on the internet.  This is all handled under the hood by your browser.  Whenever you see the lock-icon next to the address of the web site you're visiting, that's one of the things going on: That SSL is using key exchange to set up private encrypted communication.

The NDC met the other day to allocate the remaining delegates after the Nevada Caucuses, which had already allocated them 13 to 10 in favor of Clinton,  to allocate the remaining 12 bound delegates.

Nevada's convention is very complex, but there were two pools of delegates left to allocate.  A pool of 7 *at-large* delegates, and a pool of 5 *party leader* delegates.  Because both numbers are odd there could be no ties, so in the event of a close vote (spoiler alert!) the allocation would end up being 7 and 5, because from the pools the allocation goes 4/3 and 3/2, respectively.

The Sanders campaign brought 2,124 people to the convention, while Clinton brought 1,722, suggesting Sanders might get the 7 instead of the 5, but at the end of the convention the final votes were 1,695 to 1,662 in favor of Clinton, in part due to 56 Sanders voters not being registered Democrats as of May 1, the deadline.

Yeah, good plan.  Only problem is KBB isn't a static number.  If you spend 6 months paying down the $2,800 you're underwater, the KBB will have gone down by another $300-600, probably.  You can pay faster than your car can depreciate, but do you really want to be participating in that race?

I'm aware this may be viewed as radical advice, but the only sane thing to do when you're underwater is abandoning the investment.

417,"I should add something here:  It's very, very hard - though not impossible - to set your allowances *so, so high* that you get **fined** for not paying enough taxes during the year.  You need to owe at least $1000 during your return, and you need to have paid less than 90% of your total taxes over the course of the year.  And if you withheld more than your total tax bill from the previous year, then you're STILL exempt from penalties.

That last bit's important because you were probably unemployed or at least underemployed last year.  So your taxes were probably super-low in 2015, and you'll have paid more in 2016, even in the event of an underpay.

And then in 2017 you will be following up a year where you only worked 7 out of 12 months, so you'll be withholding more in 2017 than this year.

When you're doing your taxes it's going to be too late.  You're not going to get all your W-2's until February or March.  You won't be doing your taxes until what, late March, at best?  That means 3 months worth of 5 allowances, which you then need to make up in the following 9 months.  You can do that, by setting your allowances to 0.  9 months of 0 allowances and 3 months of 5 allowances averages out to a little over 1 allowance over 12 months.  But then the next year you're screwed up again, with 3 months of 0 allowances and 9 months of - I dunno, 2?

What you've not mentioned in your top post, and what is often buried **deep in the fine print**, and what is the *reason* CC companies love to do balance transfers, is that you almost *invariably* get charged a **TRANSFER FEE**.

A transfer fee is going to be a charge of a % of the balance, right off the top, for the privilege transferring the balance.  And yes, they usually come along with some sort of low-interest/no-interest terms for a certain period of time (6, 12, 18 months) but you have to calculate the no-interest period along with the transfer fee, which can get up as high as 15%.

Think about how **FUCKED** your effective interest rate is if you're paying a 15% transfer fee for the privilege of getting 0% interest for 6 months.  Congratulations, your interest rate is effectively over 30% over that period of time.

Look long and hard at the terms of any transfer offer you're looking at.  They're not doing it out of the goodness of their hearts.  They're doing it because the onerous transfer fees are going to fuck you much harder than the difference between airline miles and whatever rewards program you're not really using on your extant cards.

If you absolutely must get an airline miles card, I suggest you zero out one of your cards before you do so.  Close the old account, (or, if you have the willpower, *don't* close it, just don't use it), and open the airline card.  I'm sure someone has a recommendation.  I know my parents use American Airlines.  They get charged an annual fee once a year, call to complain about said fee every year, (threatening to cancel the card) and get the fee waived ""just this one time"", for the twelfth year in a row.

I don't bother with that, because I don't trust myself to remember to make a stink every year.

I don't think that's the greatest plan for you (you're simultaneously talking about using the card only for emergencies and hoping to cash in on miles with it - maybe you need to upgrade the definition of ""emergencies"").  But hey, maybe you're more responsible than I'm giving you credit for, and maybe I shouldn't be snooty.  You're a big boy/girl and you get to do what you want.

Just don't do the balance transfer unless you've THOROUGHLY read the fine print.  They're not your friends.  They're trying to fuck you, and I would very much doubt they'll fail to do so on a balance transfer.",2016-05-16 18:50:19+00:00,d37sw59,1.0,t3_4jm1zf,7320.0,personalfinance

423,"&gt; gross income : 48000 - now my income is around 70 but since i started this month i'd not make 70 this year but 48k instead. So i expect to receive [sic] this much. Correct?

Here's your problem, right here.  INCORRECT.

When your employer calculates how much money to take out of your paycheck (and with the aid of your declared allowances) they take your bi-weekly paycheck - pretax - multiply it by 26 (the number of bi-weeks in a year), and assume you make that much total this year.  OBVIOUSLY if they pay you weekly they multiply by 52 and if they pay you monthly they multiply by 12, etc...

Now, this is why you're getting too much taken out of your paycheck.  Because they're assuming you're making 70K this year but instead you're making 48K.  But neither your employer nor the calculator you are using is aware of whether or not you made any money from a different job before you started this one.

So here's my question:  Did you work from Jan 1 to May 1 this year?  How much did you make over that span?  If you want a cheap &amp; easy way to turn that $ into allowances, you can look at it this way:  For every $5K you made before you started this new job subtract one allowance.  If you made $20K (which accounts for 10/11th's of the difference between your annual salary of $70K and your actual salary this year of $48K) then you should go down to the regular 1 allowance.

ALSO BEWARE!  Beginning next year you'll be earning the same as your salary, so you'd better go back down to 1 allowance (2, tops) by then or you're going to owe quite a bit at the end of the year.

Don't go to an accountant.  This is not worth an accountant's time.  In fact your HR department should've explained this to you.  It's not that complicated.",2016-05-16 18:19:31+00:00,d37rk7z,1.0,t3_4jllca,11384.0,personalfinance
424,"Looks like you're talking about 4 processes:

* Extraction
* Root Canal
* Core Build-up
* Crown

The last two can wait.  Indeed, they kinda *have* to wait until the root canal is finished.  You can't do a crown on a tooth needing a root canal; You'd just need to do it again.  I'm not *entirely* sure what your dentist means by a core build-up.  He could just mean the shit they insert down the roots in a root canal, or he could mean replacing bulk amounts of your enamel (which is rotted away and not there any more in the first place) with filling material.  Either way it's not time-critical.  At least, not **as** time-critical.

I suggest you sign up for an ObamaCare plan and get the first two done, then wait out the rest with your company plan.  An exposed root canal isn't going to rot in a month, and they'll usually plug it with gutta percha or some shit before they let you out the door.  They may also put a temporary crown on top of it which can easily hold up for a month or more.  Alternatively you can *not* sign up for health insurance and get the first two done, and pay the full nut.  I don't know what your premiums are nor your deductibles nor your dentist's sliding scale, so I really can't say.

I would advise you to NOT wait on the extraction and root canals.  Those can get infected and get worse before they get better.  You don't want to get half your jaw removed because you waited a month to get a root canal.",2016-05-16 17:57:00+00:00,d37ql7g,1.0,t3_4jmcc2,430.0,personalfinance

They Giants had a trade available to move down.  You know how I know that?

And again, I didn't want to move up, or move down.  I just didn't want to reach for Apple at 10.

&gt; If you knew anything at all about the Giants and the way they build a team you blah blah...

Stop worshiping Giants management.  They've made a great big shitty mess of things.  Here's what I know about how the Giants build a team:  Reese inherited a Super Bowl contender and the past four years they've gone 9-7, 7-9, 6-10, and 6-10.  And they were LUCKY to only be 6-10 last year.  Tell me more about how they ""build a team"" because the way they build a team SUCKS BALLS, because [they can't draft](http://www.bigblueview.com/2016/1/11/10749236/new-york-giants-draft-picks-well-below-nfl-average-in-snaps-played-jerry-reese).  Those numbers are damning: Since 2007 the Giants have gotten10,767 snaps out of their draft picks, while the league gets16,448 snaps.  There's a word for those numbers.  The word is *incompetence.*

You know what that word, *incompetence* means?  Look in the mirror.

You're clearly a fucking idiot, who's in such deep denial about how badly mismanaged the Giants are that you're willing to talk yourself into just about anything at all.  Though you're desperate to NOT talk about how the Giants needed the best Left Tackle in the draft, right?  You keep sitting there, open mouthed, hoping I don't bring up how badly Ereck Flowers and Marshall Newhouse are.  Tell me, is Eli Apple's TACKLING is going to keep Eli Manning from GETTING KILLED?

So here you sit, after another disappointing draft, where the Giants screwed the pooch.  And because you're a Giants fan you can't blame THEM, so instead you pick a fight in Reddit.

I was suggesting the Giants could trade up for the two players they were interested in , Conklin and Floyd, who got drafted at 8 and 9 respectively.  So don't tell me they weren't available, **JACKASS**, and don't tell me teams wouldn't want to swap because the teams *sitting at 8 and 9* traded down, **JACKASS**.

That's going to be a game I play in this post, you fucking 'tard.  Every time I point out a basic, incorrect factual statement you make, I'm going to punctuate with **JACKASS**.

Now then, you say that there were teams who didn't want to trade *up*, into the Giants spot?  That's also [factually wrong](http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/giants/vacchiano-giants-happy-pick-eli-apple-chaotic-draft-article-1.2618415), **JACKASS**.  See, I assumed that someone reading my post would have been paying attention to the draft, but to quote one of those ""yo mamma"" jokes, you're so poor, you can't even pay attention.  And when I say poor I means stupid.

And my argument for Apple is that every talent evaluator in the world had Apple as the the 2nd or 3rd best CB on the board at the time.  Maybe the Giants know more than everybody else.  Of course if they did, they probably would've been better than 6-10 in 2015.  And 2014.  And 7-9 in 2013.  And my argument for Tunsil?  That he's the best LT prospect in the draft, and my many accounts, the best prospect since Ogden.  TO HELL with the gas mask bong.  When your starting tackles are Ereck Flowers and Marshall Newhouse, *you bite down* and take the guy who smokes a little weed.

&gt;  The Giants NEVER take soft corners. Webster, Prince, Hosley, Allen, Peterson and then James or whatever, DRC, Jenkins.... They don't deal with corners who don't tackle. Point blank period.

You've got to be kidding me.  You're saying they draft a corner because of his ability to tackle?  **GENUFLECT** when ya say that, buddy!  He can TACKLE!  HOLY SHIT!  A competent team drafts a cornerback because they think he can cover NFL wide receivers.    Oh, and by the way, ""Point blank period"" isn't a sentence.  Don't finish it with a period if you're just going to type random words that seem impressive in your head.  And none of this matters, because as I said before, even if you're convinced Apple is a better fit (and I'm not), you can get him five picks later by *trading down*:

&gt;  You telling me they couldn't trade down five picks and still get Apple? There were guys ready to move up, and here's the best part: It would've screwed over Tampa, which allowed Chicago to jump ahead of the Giants to draft that linebacker. Oh, and don't tell me the price was wrong. You got the same guy you would've gotten at, say, 15 as you did at 10, only you would've gotten SOMETHING, and last I checked SOMETHING is more than NOTHING.

Although, I have to admit, you've really impressed me with your deductive ability here:

&gt; Hargreaves was definitely lower on their board.

REALLY?  You think he was lower on their board?  You think the Giants, given their pick of Apple and Hargreaves at pick 10, picked Apple, and THAT'S your deduction?  Do you have anything else to tell me, about the color of the sky, or how wet water is?  I'll call Ripley's!

&gt;  The NFL is about depth just as much as starters. Our problem was depth last year not starters.

Yes.  That is correct.  Will Beatty got injured, and the Giants backups in place were Ereck Flowers and Marshall Newhouse.  And since those guys sucked, the Giants lack of depth punished them.

Now, of course, *this year* they released Betarry, so those two guys, who sucked balls last year?  They're the starters now.  GOSH it'd be nice to have the best LT prospect in the draft on this roster pushing Flowers to RT, and pushing Newhouse to backup, instead of a slot corner.  Wait, excuse me: instead of a slot corner **WHO CAN TACKLE**.

&gt; We had the lead in almost every game.

So what?  Do they give you a medal for that, nitwit?

This pick was incompetent.  Two teams jumped in front of the Giants to pick guys who they might've had ahead of Apple so instead the Giants sit there like deer in headlights and reach.

I don't accept the assertion that Apple's a better player than Hargreaves, so I'm not even sold that they got the right CORNER, but let's say, for the moment, Reese is right about Apple.  You telling me they couldn't trade down five picks and still get Apple?  There were guys ready to move up, and here's the best part: It would've screwed over Tampa, which allowed Chicago to jump ahead of the Giants to draft that linebacker.

If nothing else it's worth it to hose the Bucs.

But trading down was never an option for Reese.  He's never traded down in his life.  Evidently, he doesn't know how.  The only thing Reese has in common with down is the syndrome.

If you don't want to move down, there *is* one other option, by the way.  Instead of sitting there, with a stupid look on his face, doing nothing, Reese could've done the opposite of nothing:  SOMETHING.  He could've moved up.  Obviously there were picks available to move up to.  But nope, this whole draft process is an opaque mystery for him.

But let's forget about all that for a second.  We all realize that the current Giants tackles are Ereck Flowers and Marshall Newhouse, right?  FAIL.  The smart pick was Tunsil.  Which, of course, is why Reese whiffed on it.  Because Marshall Newhouse, AKA *The worst RT in the league last year* AKA *The worst tackle overall in the league over the past five years* AKA *The worst tackle in the CFL in 2018* has got it LOCKED DOWN.

I like this pick.  I think this guy has the tools to be a good player, and he's undervalued asset because he's only 5' 10"".  A lot of guys get downgraded come draft time for stupid shit like that, only to take their frustration out on the rest of the league for 15 years thereafter, a-la Steve Smith.  (The Carolina SS, not the NYG SS).  Obviously, he's unlikely to become Steve Smith, but if the worst thing someone can say about you is you're 2 inches too short then maybe you have potential.  If nothing else, he's the OPPOSITE of that stiff, Ramses Barden.  Won't that be nice?  NOT seeing Barden mail it in for another year?  Oh yeah, and Robert Mays loves the guy.

**3 - Thompson C+**

I don't know much about this guy.  But he fills a need.  So I guess another body in the *please God, can SOMEONE play free safety?* competition can't be bad.

OK, let's set aside, for the moment, that Reese is the same genius who drafted and developed (more to the point, *failed to develop*) adequate depth so rookies were thrust into starting jobs.  Let's set aside that everyone he drafts seems to end up injury-prone:  At a certain point that's not bad luck and that's going out of his way to find guys who're bad injury risks.  But let's ignore all that.

Here's my question: Who got injured to force Pugh to play RT in 2013?  There was nobody.  They dumped him in there because they thought he could play immediately, and because they thought he was a RT.  They were wrong:

* [NYG Scouting Director thinks Pugh, originally a tackle at Syracuse, can play anywhere on the line.](http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/giants/giants-pick-pocket-protector-pugh-article-1.1327879)

* [Reese thinks Pugh can play Tackle](http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/04/29/draft-review-new-york-giants/)

* [Who else is on the roster in 2013 to play RT?](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/nyg/2013_roster.htm)

To be fair, Reese didn't draft Schwartz in 2014.  He *signed* him intead, after a series of injury-shortened seasons in the NFL, and exactly ONE good season in KC.  He had even MORE evidence that Schwartz couldn't stay healthy, and then OOPS!  Schwartz plays 13 games in 2 years before they just released him.  Who's fault was that?  And who signed JD Walton that year to push Richburg off Center?

* Reese: [""Obviously you need depth at every position and that’s the position that we think Richburg will provide for us, some depth at center, which is his natural position, but we think he could play guard as well.""](http://www.giants.com/news-and-blogs/article-1/Giants-draft-Center-Weston-Richburg-in-second-round/a45e562a-0007-4bf1-b25f-dfd93861ae0f)

I'm saying Pugh sucks.  He was one of the worst right tackles in the league before being moved to a less demanding position at guard, where he's been adequate.

I'm saying Richburg sucks.  He was one of the worst guards in the league before being moved to a less demanding position at center, where he's been adequate.

I'm saying Flowers sucks.  FULL STOP.

I'm saying Collins sucks.  FULL STOP.

Last year Flowers was the worst left tackle in the league.  As was Collins, at Free Safety.

Graziano isn't being a dick.  He's not saying mean things about the Giants organization.  He's DESCRIBING THEM.

What does [Pro Football Focus think of Landon Collins](https://twitter.com/pff/status/674756973930356736) in their rankings of all the safeties in 2015?

75th.  He's ranked seventy fucking fifth.  60 starting safeties in this league and he's ranked 75.  Yeah, I'd say he's the worst.

He's ranked behind Donte ""Hitner"" Whitner.  He's ranked, amazingly, behind Rahim ""Mile High Miracle"" Moore.  You remember that moron?  He was the safety who sat there, with a stupid look on his face, while Jacoby Jones ran right past him and singlehandedly lost a playoff game for the Broncos.  I'm shocked he's still in the league.

Here's what confuses me:  How are there 11 guys who are ranked BEHIND Collins?  Are there NFL players confined to wheelchairs?  I mean, I guess I have to give Collins a little bit of credit.

521,"&gt; I have a follow up question to all of this since it sounds like you know what you're talking about.

I'm not sure if I'd go that far.

&gt; I've seen the receiving team all huddle around a ball that's dropped onto the field and stare at it like it like it's going to grow legs and walk away. If the other team can't pick up the ball and take possession of it, what is the purpose of them protecting it in this way?

That's during a punt, and only the *punting* team doing that.  They're not trying to protect the ball.  They're trying to let the ball roll forwards as far as possible, and if it ever starts moving back toward them - remember this is a funny shaped ball - they'll grab it before it goes too far.  Remember it's safe for them to touch the ball.  The moment the punting team touches the ball it freezes at that spot and goes over to the other team.

The other team *could* do that, but they'd be giant idiots to try.  The reason why the *other* team should never do that, is because if the receiving team ever touches the ball, even if only by accident, then it's a free ball.  First guy to fall on it gets possession.  So if you're a punt returner, and you're not going to catch &amp; return the ball, or fair catch the ball, the best thing to do is STAY THE HELL AWAY.  It's incredibly stupid to stand near the ball.  All you need to do is NOT FUCKING TOUCH ANYTHING and your team will get the ball.  Nothing good can happen if you touch it.

Of course, we're talking about football players - not rocket scientists - and probably 10% of them are playing concussed at any given moment.  So occasionally it happens.

By the way, this will never happen with a kickoff.  The ball is always and almost immediately free-for-all on a kickoff.  It has to travel 15 yards before the kicking team can recover it.  That's the only rule.  So on a kickoff, if the kicking team is ever in that position they'd just pick it up and start running.  That's why you see a pile of guy at the 50 - exactly 15 yards past the point the ball is kicked from - waiting to either grab the ball if it comes to them (that almost never happens) or block if it goes high in the air past them (that almost always happens.)",2016-02-17 03:23:56+00:00,d02s279,3.0,t1_d02ja7d,13678.0,explainlikeimfive
522,"There are two situations you could be referring to.  And the odds are if you're confused it's because you're conflating the two.  There are *PUNTS* and *KICKOFFS*.

* A *Punt* is when the team with the ball is on it's fourth down, and rather than risk turning the ball over to the other team after their next play, they opt to punt it back to the other team instead.  The ball will end up back an additional 30-40 yards, but it'll end up in the other team's possession.  The offensive team snaps the ball back to a guy standing behind the line (the punter), [he catches the ball, drops is from chest-height, and then kicks it downfield.](http://i880.photobucket.com/albums/ac6/cmpain/Punt.gif)

* A *Kickoff* is when the offensive team has just scored, either by touchdown or field goal, and now the ball goes to the other team.  They put the ball on a tee at the 35-yard line, and a guy standing about 15 yards behind the ball (the kicker), [takes a running start and kicks it as far as he can down the field.](https://media.giphy.com/media/5xtDarzCAAMs4luHyeI/giphy.gif)

Why am I making this distinction?  Because *the rules of football differ depending on which play is being run*.  Specifically they differ on what happens if nobody from the other team touches the ball during a punt or a kickoff.  If nobody touches the ball during a *Punt*, the ball eventually comes to a stop.  At that point the play is whistled *dead* and the ball's awarded to the receiving team at the spot the ball stopped moving.

If nobody touches the ball during a *Kickoff*, the ball remains live.  In fact, if a member of the **KICKING TEAM** grabs the ball, (subject to certain rules, that go beyond an ELI5) then they get the ball!  So a member of the receiving team really needs to grab the ball!

So with that in mind, here are the decisions to be made:

**DURING A PUNT**

* *Punt Into the End Zone* - If the punt goes very deep, like past the receiving team's ten yard line, then it's in real danger of going into the end zone.  If it does, then the receiving team is awarded the ball on the 20 yard line.  So the punt returner (the guy who's job it is to catch the punt) will often just let the ball drop &amp; bounce, hoping it goes into the end zone and they can get the ball on the 20 without a fuss.  This is a good deal for the receiving team: If the ball would have been caught at the 5, and you offered them a guaranteed 15-yard return with a guarantee of nothing bad (fumbles, injuries, etc...) happening, they'd sign up.

* *Punt Fair Caught* - If the punt goes very **HIGH**, and it's in no danger of going into the end zone, then often it gets fair caught.  It's very high, so it hangs up there a while, giving the punting team plenty of time for their guys to get downfield right next to the returner.  And they're getting all set to line up and take the guy's head off.  To avoid this the punt returner waves his arms like he's flagging a passing car, and then catches the punt where it's going to first hit the ground.  The opposing team isn't allowed to touch him but he's not allowed to run with the ball.  Since he probably would've gotten obliterated the moment he caught the ball (and maybe something bad happens - fumble, injury, etc...), this isn't a bad deal.

* *Punt Allowed To Bounce* - Sometimes the returner doesn't have a good play to make, either a fair catch or a return, so instead he just stays out of the way and the punt bounces.  Mostly it bounces forward (good for the punting team) but sometimes backwards.  It **is**, after all, an oddly shaped ball.  Eventually the ball stops moving and it is awarded to the receiving team at the spot it stops moving.  Or, if the punting team touches it, it stops there at that spot.

* *Punt Returned* - Sometimes the returner catches the ball and runs it back.

**DURING A KICKOFF**

* *Kickoff Into the End Zone* - If the kickoff ends up in the end zone, the ball still needs to be fielded by the receiving team.  But once they do the returner can ""take a knee"" and the ball is advanced to the 20 yard line, just like a punt into the end zone.

* *Kickoff THROUGH The End Zone* - This is the exact same result, only no kneel-down because it's impossible to field the ball in the field of play.

* *Kickoff Returned* - This is the only realistic other outcome.

During a kickoff there is no fair catch.  But that's mostly because the defenders have a much longer way to run to get to the guy catching the ball during kickoffs, so there's less need to protect the guy.  And they never let the kickoff bounce, or if they do, they pick it up ASAP, because a kickoff is fair game for either team.",2016-02-16 22:04:46+00:00,d02fjrm,1.0,t3_46482r,8071.0,explainlikeimfive

567,"I don't have any hard and fast answers here, but I can make a guess that I think is pretty good, and it's been a couple of hours with no strong answers.

ADHD is often a childhood disease.  That makes it limited in scope.  It's only necessary to treat it until 18 or 22 (for kids going to college).  The cost to an insurance company for drugs under those circumstances are limited to the 6-8 years and then they're done with it.

Once someone's an adult, and they're still saying they need it, that means the insurance company is looking at 40-50 years of treatment of a chronic illness rather than 6-8 years of an acute illness.  It also means they don't just need the Adderall or Ritalin to do well in school, but rather cope with day-to-day life.  That means they've got a more serious case of ADHD.  (Maybe.  Again, I'm just pulling this outta my ass.)

Remember insurance companies don't pay for people's treatment individually, they treat people in the aggregate.  When they're on the hook for paying for ADHD meds for 6 years for a covered dependent they know they're also going to be getting 1.85 (remember: *averages!*) healthy adults making little demand on the health care system for another 24-28 years, but paying into their system the whole time.  For an adult, that means no healthy parents helping out, and an indefinite amount of time paying for the medication, which makes it in the aggregate more expensive, so they charge more.

If someone who works in the insurance industry (or better yet, an actual actuary - GET IT?  ACTUAL ACTUARY?!?!) would chime in they'd probably have better answers, certainly more specific ones than I'm offering up here.",2016-01-29 20:58:52+00:00,czgu7xc,1.0,t3_439z1d,10515.0,explainlikeimfive

594,"There is one way, and exactly one way, to play the lottery:

Don't.

Wait, wait, I'm not being a dick, just being dramatic!  I'm not done!

Don't play the lottery.  Until such time as the lottery becomes profitable.

So let's model the Powerball, for instance, to determine at what point it becomes profitable, shall we?  The odds of winning the Powerball is 1 in 292 million, or thereabouts.  It's not *exactly* that, but let's just say 1 in 292M to make the math simple.  One way to model the Powerball is to say whenever the prize gets &gt; $292 million, then it's profitable to buy a ticket.

*But wait!*  The cost of a ticket is $2, not $1 so now the prize needs to get above $584 million.  *But wait!*  The lump sum payout is only 62% of the advertised prize, so now the prize needs to get above $942 million.  *But wait!*  The federal government takes a 40% bite out of your ass, so now the prize needs to get above $1.57 billion.  (Yeesh!)

And even then, there's one more calculation you need to perform: What is the average number of winners as a function of the lottery prize.  If, for example, for any prize &gt; $1.5 billion, there is an average of 1 winner, then your prize would need to get above $3.14 billion.  And I don't think those numbers are reasonable, either:  We just got three winners for a $1.6 billion jackpot.  So at that point the prize would need to be $6.28 billion to be profitable, and that's assuming that the number of winners doesn't rise right along with the jackpot, which is not at all a reasonable assumption.  I think as the prize becomes more and more ridiculous you get more tickets, though that's just me pulling that statement out of my ass.

I leave it to the next person to try to model the number of winners as a function of the prize amount, to see if there are any prize numbers where buying a ticket would be profitable.  Because the moment it does, it actually becomes profitable to buy all 292 million combinations, like those guys in Massachusetts did.",2016-01-14 19:29:14+00:00,cyy98vv,1.0,t3_40tpd8,85828.0,askscience

644,"Let's pretend, for the moment, that there are two sets of rules.  The first is people must make a 3-6 letter long password with just the 26 letters of the alphabet.

The second is that people must make an exactly 6 letter long password with just the 26 letters of the alphabet plus the 10 digits and the 10 symbols represented on a keyboard above those digits:  !@#$%^&amp;*&amp;() on most American keyboards.  And let's also say that repeating a character is forbidden.

These are two reasonable approximations of the rules you're describing.  The first set of rules is when there are no password rules, and the second is a set of reasonable(ish) password rules.  So now let's look at how large the set of passwords that'd have to be guessed get in those two cases:

For Case 1 it's pretty easy.  You have the 3, 4, 5, and 6-letter long passwords.  For the 26 letters in the alphabet, that's **N^1** combinations where:

N^1 = 26^3 + 26^4 + 26^5 + 26^6

And because the first two numbers are *so so much smaller* than the last two, we're going to approximate this number as:

N^1 = 26^5 + 26^6 = 26^5 + 26 * 26^5 = (1 + 26) * 26^5

N^1 = 27 * 26^5 = 320,800,000

That's a rough approximation, but pretty close, I'd expect.

Now let's consider the number of combinations in the second set of rules.  That's more complicated but we can probably approximate some stuff.  First note the size requirements make it much simpler.  If we didn't have the ""at least one symbol/number"" requirement, nor the ""no repeated character"" requirement then we'd be pretty simple:

N^2 = 46^6 = 9,470,000,000

That's 9.5 billion vs. 320 million.  Just from adding 20 characters to the set of possible characters.

Now, how do we enforce the ""no repeated"" bit?  Well if you think about it, each time you choose a character in the password, you multiply the number of possible passwords by the number of eligible characters.  In a 6-character password that means:

N^2 = 46 * 46 * 46 * 46 * 46 * 46 = 46^6

But what happens when repetition becomes forbidden?  Well shit, actually that's easy.  There's one less eligible character for all but the first character chosen, so now:

N^2' = 46 * 45 * 45 * 45 * 45 * 45 = 46 * 45^5 = 8,490,000,000

Hmm...  Going from 9.5 billion to 8.5 billion is losing a lot of combinations, but it's still WAY ahead of N^1 ...  Now for the hard part.

Let's try to approximate what happens when you *require* an exotic character, the 20 numbers/symbols we added to the 26 characters.  Well actually it's not as hard as you think.  Why?  Because we can calculate how many permutations there are with only the letters, by adding in the *no-repetition* constraint:

N^1 = 27 * 26^5 = 320,800,000

N^1' = = 27 * 25^5 = 263,000,000

So now let's just subtract out the ""alphabetical-only"" forbidden passwords.  What do we get?

N^final = N^2' - N^1' = 8,500,000,000 - 263,000,000 = 8,237,000,000

So there are 8.2 billion passwords with the password rules, and only 320 million if you only use the alphabet only.

There's only one catch: I pretended that people are *required* to only use the alphabet.  That's not true.  In your example people are free to use any password they like in the first case.

But the truth is, that's not how things work out.  In practice if people aren't required to follow certain complexity rules, they pick the stupidest possible passwords allowed.  90% of the passwords they choose will end up being crap like ""apple"", ""aaaaaa"", or ""password"".  So in practice, allowing for alphabetical passwords is tantamount to **requiring** them.",2015-11-18 00:52:03+00:00,cx3z5ns,1.0,t3_3t5i5d,42441.0,explainlikeimfive

You're not trolling; you're not picking a fight, because what I posted probably wasn't easy to read for a Giants fan.  I say that because as a Giants fan, it wasn't easy to write.  I may disagree with you, and you certainly disagree with me, but you're not being a dick about it.

You're right.  Richburg's pretty good this year.  But when a guy moves to the less demanding position (tackle to guard to center, or CB to nickel CB to safety) that's to be expected.  He got drafted at a position where you draft a guard, so drafting a center there is an overpay.  Plus, I hate to point this out, (you were talking about Reese's improving FA signings) but he was playing out of position because Reese signed the execrable JD Walton.

And Walton was only the *second* worst signing of that year.  The worst signing was a guy who - if it were just about merit - the third string running back on the team, behind Vereen and Donnie Darko or Darquo or whatever his name is.  And this year?  I don't believe he's getting much better, either.  He signed Dwayne Harris for $17.5M, $7.5M guaranteed.  Who was out there offering $16M for this guy?  Paying borderline #1/#2 money for a #3 WR is how you end up having to let go of more talented players like Linval Joseph.

&gt; our injury situation was above average before he was our GM so unless you can prove that he drafts more than a normal amount of injury prone players you can't pin all of that on him. 

This is precisely my point, sir.  Staying healthy is a skill, a skill that I believe Reese incapable of identifying.  So he drafts these guys that fall to him, while the rest of the league passes on a guy because of the injury concerns.  And his terrible drafting is costing us in the cap - you've got to get value out of those cheap players to afford $20M quarterbacks and free agents who cost 4x as much, pound for pound.

* 2011 4th rounder, James Brewer, out of the league.
* 2012 4th rounder Adrienne Robinson, 1 game started in his career.
* 2012 4th rounder Brandon Mosley.  Never heard of him before today.  1 game started in his career.  Currently on IR.  (OF COURSE)
* 2012 5th rounder NOBODY.  Traded away.
* 2013 4th rounder Ryan Nassib.  The Maytag Repairman of the NFL.
* 2013 5th rounder Cooper Taylor.  3 games played this year.  Currently - wait for it - yes, INJURED!  And even when he was healthy, can't beat out a moron who knocks himself unconscious while jumping up and down for the job.

I've never even heard of the rest of the draft picks, for all the contributions they're making.

As for Pugh/Richburg, it's not surprising they've improved when they get moved to less demanding positions.  Only trouble is we still have the worst tackles in the league, and we've wasted tackle draft picks on guys who should've gone two rounds later.

Oh and one more thing.  The nice thing about centers and guards is nobody has any idea what they do, so it's easy to say ""our guys are great!""  Find 31 other fans of 31 other teams, and they'll all be convinced their centers &amp; guards are terrific.  ""Best in the league!""  But they're probably full of shit.

And that brings us to Collins and Flowers.  They're first round picks.  And don't tell me Collins is a second rounder.  a) it's a technicality, and b) Reese paid a first round price to move up to draft him, so he cost us first round draft pick(s).  And they both suck.  Ereck Flowers was the worst left tackle in the league yesterday.  That's not me saying it.  It's [these guys](https://www.profootballfocus.com/blog/2015/11/16/pro-worst-players-at-every-position-from-week-10/).  Plus, you don't get to grade the GM on a curve because the rookies are filling in for injured players.  The GM *drafted those injured player!*, guys that couldn't stay healthy!  GOSH it'd be nice if James Brewer, or Brandon Mosley could be backup tackles, 'cuz the 4th round of the draft is where you like to get those guys.  Sadly Reese sucks at drafting, so he may as well set his mid-round picks on fire for all the good he's doing with them.  And GOSH, it'd be nice if he didn't PISS AWAY money on JD Walton who can't play center to play center for them, forcing Richburg into a different position.  And GOSH, it'd be nice if he didn't release Stevie Brown, who's currently playing VASTLY better than Collins.

Fucking up all those mid-round picks is how Reese has obliterated whatever depth this team had, how he depleted the salary cap - 'cuz now we have to pay free agent prices for mediocrities like a $17.5M kick returner instead of just drafting one in the 6th round - and why the team's going into the crapper.

670,"Three reasons:

1. Heisman trophy winners tend to be quarterbacks.  This isn't so much a reason as the context you should evaluate the other two answers.  This is only natural, as the award is basically a ""college player MVP"" and quarterbacks are worth three to four times more than any other position.

2. 95% of the Quarterbacks in college can't play in the NFL.  Shit, that's an overestimate.  It's probably closer to 99%.  Take a look around in the NFL right now.  How many *competent* quarterbacks are there?  12?  Maybe 14?  *TOPS?!?*  The other 16-18 franchises are just marking time until they can draft one of those guys.  Playing quarterback at the NFL level is nearly impossible, so it should be no surprise that college quarterbacks fail often.

3. Finally, and this is probably the most important bit: The skills that make you a good college quarterback are often different than those that make you a good NFL quarterback.  I'm loath to go into too much detail, because other people know more about football than I do, and frankly, nobody *really* knows what makes a good quarterback.  It's how Ryan Leaf goes #2 overall, while Wilson &amp; Brady go in the third and sixth rounds.  But I will give a few examples:

* Running quarterbacks are less valuable in the NFL, because the defenders are bigger and faster, so if the quarterback runs around, there's a nonzero chance he'll get FUCKING KILLED.  The reason you don't find guys like Khalil Mack in college is that they leave early and become Khalil Mack in the NFL.  Remember how athletic Michael Vick, and (more recently) RGIII used to be?  They ain't so pretty no more, huh?  That skill evaporates fast.

* Taller quarterbacks are important in the NFL, because the offensive linemen are likewise bigger.  Prototype tackle size is like 6'8"", 6'7"".  Even the centers and guards are over 6'2"" or so.  If your Heisman winner's 5'11"" he's shit out of luck.  He can't see over the center.  (Doug Flutie is the example that proves the rule - Teams kept dropping him like a bad habit.)

* Reading defenses is more important in the NFL, because in college they don't have complicated defenses.  Practice time is (putatively) limited, and the players spend less time learning a complicated defense.  A college defensive coordinator's probably happy if he gets 11 guys (3 of whom may very well be concussed at the time) running ONE defense, much less disguising it, or running two or three in a game.  NFL quarterbacks have to read the defense, adjust the play, the protection, the hot reads, and half a dozen other different things in the 15 seconds while they're under center.  In college the coach just radios in the play.

* Reacting to pass-rush pressure is more important in the NFL, because Heisman trophy winners tend to come from Miami, Florida State, the big schools.  Those are schools with 3 or 4 NFL prospects playing in the O-line at any given time, and as a result, the quarterback's uniform rarely gets dirty.  Those guys just outclass 90% of the players they face.  But in the NFL, every team can rush the passer at least a little bit.  One of the reasons Eli Manning was the consensus #1 in 2004 is that he'd spent the entire year getting killed behind an injury-plagued Ole Miss line, and he still got rid of the ball on time and accurately.  Many college QB's and Heisman winners especially have never experienced a pass rush before they get to the NFL.

There are other reasons I'm sure, but what it boils down to is that the skills that make a QB a successful college QB aren't always the ones that make him a successful NFL QB.",2015-11-05 05:01:55+00:00,cwp34ry,1.0,t3_3rhat2,63813.0,explainlikeimfive

That is incorrect.

* Mass of the Earth: 5.9722 * 10^24 kg
* Radius of the Earth: 6.371 * 10^6 m

* Mass of the Crust: 2.37 * 10^22 kg
* Thickness of the Crust: 1.5 * 10^4 m

The gravitational acceleration at the surface of the Earth is:

A^sur = K * 5.972 * 10^24 * ( 6.371 * 10^6 )^-2 = 0.14713 * 10^12 * G 

The gravitational acceleration at the crust/mantle boundary is:

A^bou = K * 5.9485 * 10^24 kg * ( 6.356 * 10^ 6 )^-2 = 0.14724 * 10^12 * G

I can only assume you're talking about [this diagram from wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/EarthGravityPREM.svg).  It's failure to show a third peak is more the result of the resolution of the diagram.  The crust is only 15 kilometers thick, while resolution of that diagram is what, 2000 km a tick?  The lines at each tick are probably 50 km wide at that resolution.

Note, there is plenty of wiggle room for the thickness of the crust, as it varies from 8-32 km in thickness.  I took a very conservative value of 15 km, which is about the lowest plausible value for above-the-ocean locations.  Larger values of the crust thickness (and the actual thickness is **likely** to be larger) yield *more* gravity at the boundary, as you end up closer to the Earth's center.",2015-10-13 18:45:37+00:00,cvyfs39,8.0,t1_cvy9nrx,8603.0,askscience

707,"&gt; How is that stupid?

Let me count the ways:

* He's a fucking robot.  The whole series up until that moment the Terminators are emblematic of technology run amok, trampling over man.  Now, all of a sudden, two weeks with Edward Furlong and the Tin man's *grown a heart!*  It's not beautiful, it's ridiculous and stupid.  It's implausible in the universe that'd already been established in the previous 1.85 movies.

* It comes out of nowhere.  **LITERALLY FIVE MINUTES EARLIER** the Terminator is brainlessly parroting out one-liners like *""Hasta La Vista... Baby""* before shooting a grenade into the T-1000, and then SMASHCUT, he understands love and pain and crying.  And it's something he can never do!  SOB!

* It's internal logic is contradictory.  If the Terminator can really feel empathy (as you just just said: *""He was expressing empathy""*) then it should be able to cry, no?  Why not?  Why is **crying** the line it can't cross?  Would they be *magic* tears?  Could he trade them for some beans?  Did they fail to install tear ducts?

* It's a FUCKING COP-OUT.  The vastly better ending of this movie is the Terminator coldly, logically, stepping onto the chain and being lowered into the molten metal.  No uplifting bullshit to the kid.  No ridiculous thumbs-up.  It sinks into the slag because it's mission was to protect John &amp; Sarah, and that's the fulfillment of that mission.  All of John's ridiculous pain is exposed for what it is: The anthropomorphization of a machine.  He's one step removed from [this kid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5tWT6I1GvY), freaking out over the loss of a **thing**.  Of course the kid does that.  He's made the Terminator into his father.  Or at least his father-figure.  But that doesn't make the thing his father, and it doesn't make it love him.

The better ending to this movie is the Terminator sinking impassively into the Slag, while John freaks out and sobs.  Because it may be a father figure, but it's not his fucking father.  And then Sarah and John have to face a vast, unwritten, indifferent future.  *Which is very nearly as terrifying as the apocalypse.*",2015-10-09 17:25:18+00:00,cvtwgpq,6.0,t1_cvtfhfb,41823.0,AskReddit

*""What makes a particular gas opaque to a certain color of light?""*

The second is:

*""Why does a gas opaque to a certain color of light act as a greenhouse gas?""*

Superhelical's answer on the former question is excellent, so I'll attempt to answer the second instead:

[This](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Solar_spectrum_en.svg/2000px-Solar_spectrum_en.svg.png) is a diagram of the light spectra we receive from the sun.  The yellow is the incoming band, while the red is what actually reaches the Earth's surface.  You can also observe absorption lines, at 750 nm from Oxygen, 900, 1100, and 1350 nm from water vapor, etc...  What's important to take away from this is that the total amount of energy **incoming** to the Earth is roughly equal to the area under the red curve.  Maybe there are some contributions from the yellow as well, because the atmosphere that absorbs the light is still part of the Earth.

By contrast [this](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/earth103/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.earth103/files/module03/fig10out.png) is what the Earth emits, due to blackbody radiation of it's own temperature.

As you can see from this image, the Earth's wavelengths are much further in the longer-wave (lower frequency and lower energy) radiation.  Also, you can see the absorption bands from carbon dioxide, oxygen, water, and ozone in this diagram as well.  When a gas has absorption bands in that area of the spectrum, it traps energy in the Earth's system, instead of allowing it to radiate away into space.

When that happens, the balance of energy shifts:  The Earth's temperature rises (well, really just the atmosphere and the hydrosphere: I rather doubt the temperature of the *rock* changes much) and as the temperature rises, the amount of energy emitted by blackbody radiation, which is proportional to ~T^4 , rises to compensate.  *That's global warming.*",2015-09-30 16:01:37+00:00,cvjeb4u,1.0,t3_3mysg9,7743.0,askscience

So viewed in that context, our teeth last exactly as long as they're supposed to.  Sure, they still rot out of our heads over the course of the first 12 years of our lives, but that's not a big deal, as our baby teeth fall out and we get a new set.

After the baby teeth come out and the adult teeth come in?  Well, they, too, rot out, but *that's what our wisdom teeth are for!*  You think it's an accident that nowadays wisdom teeth come in impacted?  They're supposed to fill in around age 20-24 for teeth that have rotted out of our head, shifting the remaining teeth forward as they come in.  Between the extant adult teeth and the extra wisdom teeth, a human should have enough teeth to consume food until at least 30 or so.

After that?  Meh.  Evolution stops caring.  A trait that improves survivability of an organism after that organism has finished reproducing and is no longer fertile is not relevant.

812,"Moore's law isn't a physical law.  It isn't even a *technology* law.

Moore's law is an observation about the computing industry.  That means it's an **economic** law.  What it really describes is the behavior of *two competing companies*, Intel and AMD (and, I suppose, to a much lesser extent, the others: NVIDIA, IBM, and Samsung), and the pace at which they improve their chip fab facilities, continually refining their lithography techniques to allow for smaller and smaller features to be printed onto a CPU.  And at the same time it's all being driven on the other side by software advancements that actually *require* those better CPU's.  It hardly matters how awesome your computer is if all it's doing is running Windows 3.1.

So in that context, I think you begin to see that Moore's law isn't so much a law of science or physics or even engineering, as it is merely an observation about the ways that Intel &amp; AMD continually compete with each other.  Why does AMD hit that *doubling-every-18-months* target?  'Cuz they know Intel is likely to do so and they don't want to fall behind.

My point is it's not just engineering problems that are being solved; It's also economic ones.  You could probably double every, say, 12 months, if you didn't mind increasing the cost of the computer by 50% each time.  But consumers would mind that, they'd mind that very much, and they'd just wait an extra six months to buy those computers until their prices had dropped.

What's impressive about Moore's law isn't the regularity, but the extent to which it's held up against other barriers:  A few years ago it stopped being possible to make CPU's running at higher frequencies.  What'd they do?  They shrugged, and put 2 CPU's running at the old frequencies in the space previously taken up by 1, 18 months earlier.",2015-07-22 15:22:20+00:00,ctc6f8q,1.0,t3_3e67kr,29715.0,askscience

Because a thermometer is already AT the environment's temperature, (it HAS TO BE, or else it wouldn't be reading the right temperature!) the wind has no affect on it.

There is a similar notion known as ""dry bulb"" and ""wet bulb"" temperatures.  The idea is a thermometer soaked in water will read a lower temperature at quasi-equilibrium (it's not REALLY at equilibrium - eventually it runs out of water) because the continually evaporating water keeps the temperature of the thermometer lower than the environment.

But that bit is really just a measure of humidity (you can calculate the relative humidity if you have both dry- and wet- bulb temps), and has little to do with your question.

In the case of Uranus, not necessarily.  To be absolutely exactly 90 degrees, you would, but Uranus isn't like that.  It's entirely possible that Uranus had some of it's prograde angular momentum cancelled in the collision, but equally possible that it just got a LOT MORE of the orthogonal angular momentum added, so much so that the original, unchanged prograde angular momentum seems small by comparison (""seems small by comparison"" is the ""almost"" in ""almost 90 degrees"".)

[EDIT2]

Joe Torre disease is primarily an affliction of relievers, and it has a very clear progression of symptoms:

* Joe Torre is the pitcher's manager
* Joe Torre decides that the pitcher is ""trustworthy"".
* The pitcher pitchs a 100+ innings in a season as a reliever, and you get warmed up at least 120 times.
* The next year your arm falls off.

In all the years he managed the Yankees, Joe Torre disease was almost universally fatal.  It claimed the careers of Ramiro Mendoza, Tanyon Sturtz, Scott Proctor, Tom Gordon, and Steve Karsay.  It's like Rabies: Almost nobody survives an acute case.  There's only been one documented case of survival, and that guy may very well have been the result of a science experiment by an insane Panamanian scientist, [assembled from the body parts of dead pitchers](http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/riverma01.shtml).

Mostly.

I've gotten something strange out of my output:

In the context of this video, the inputs that the program messes around with are the buttons on the controller, random ""mutations"" are occasionally introduced to change the inputs at certain intervals, and the progress though the level defines ""better"" and ""worse"" for the computer.

As for actually evaluating progress - It's usually as simple as screen scraping for shape recognition.",2015-06-16 06:06:26+00:00,cs83xrj,1.0,t3_3a0atg,1257.0,explainlikeimfive
