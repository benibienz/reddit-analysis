&gt;   6 **Damontre Moore**, DE, Seattle Seahawks

&gt;  *The primary job of an edge rusher is to get pressure, so when you rush the passer 31 times and come away with absolutely none, that’s a problem. In fact, despite 42 snaps of action against the Eagles, Moore was effectively blanked from the stat sheet entirely. Only a penalty for jumping offside was proof that he was even on the field this week, and it marked the biggest volume of playing time he has logged this season.*

Let's begin with a postulate: There's not enough practice time available for coaches and players.  Now I'm not making a value judgement, mind you.  The players negotiated less practice time during preseason and the regular season for an excellent reason: Playing football at the NFL level causes brain damage.  So let me put it another way: There's *less* practice time available for coaches &amp; players than there has been in the past.

What are the implications of this development?  Well first and foremost we see the biggest impact over the first 9 weeks of the season is that there aren't really any good teams any more.  There are just varying degrees of incompetent.  The Philadelphia Eagles are leading the league in overall DVOA and then get beat by the Giants and the next week they're *still leading the league in overall DVOA*.  Remember that Green Bay team that the Giants couldn't beat?  It's currently 4-5 riding a 3-game losing streak.  They're 1-4 since beating us.  Ditto for the Vikings, who are in the middle of a 4-game losing streak, now that their offensive line is awful and Sam Bradford has turned into a pumpkin.

And when I say ""Sam Bradford has turned into a pumpkin"" what I really mean is *""Sam Bradford has turned into SAM BRADFORD""*.

So the overall level of play is down.  Which teams benefit from this? Well the Patriots benefit from this just like they benefit from anything that changes in the NFL: Because their coach is smarter than all the other coaches and he sees this shit coming.  There's not much anyone can do about that.  Who else benefits?  The Cowboys.  Because the Cowboys have something that everybody else lacks: A mammoth, dominating offensive line that has been together for multiple season, rendering the reduced practice time development moot, because it doesn't take very long to learn the play that reads ""You 5 guys block the 5 guys in front of you because you're MUCH BETTER at this than they are.""

So enough about the Patriots and Cowboys.  How are the Giants affected by this?  Well first and foremost the Giants offense is suffering, *and suffering badly* because of it.  There's not much point in having Eli Manning if he's not able to audible into a meaningfully different play, and the Giants play selection is severely curtailed right now, as we've all discussed *ad nauseam*.

Yeah, they *kind of* expanded the playbook last week, but after watching that game a second time I don't think they added more than a half-dozen options, which mostly consisted of re-jiggering the wide reciever positions from the 11-personnel package.  The value of those plays was more in their surprise value than genuinely expanding the playbook, so I'd expect Cincinnati's defense to be ready for those 6 or 7 new looks, and if we want to have a meaningfully better offense this week we should hope for a **new** half-dozen plays installed by McAdoo, *et. al.*  In particular the Giants rushing attack has been described as exactly two plays.  I sure hope that's an exaggeration, but even if it is, it's not by much, but I'm not sure if it'd matter.  The Giants can't run the ball because the Giants can't run the ball.  It's not like losing their best offensive lineman (Pugh) for three weeks is going to improve matters, and my days of thinking Perkins is **meh** are coming to a middle.

Enough of the bad news, there *is* good news, too.  There was a time when running an aggressive, guessing man-to-man pass defense would be considered foolhardy, when you'd get victimized by timing plays like a back-should deep out.  But those plays are harder to execute with limited practice time, and it's not an accident that as a consequence, we're seeing man-to-man players like DRC and Jenkins play better than their histories would suggest: Passing offenses are sloppier, and just like the Giants run too few plays, so too is the rest of the league running fewer play permutations for our corner backs to read (only less so.)

I don't know if the Giants are appreciably ahead of the curve regarding the lack of practice time.  Certainly they weren't smart enough to make the playbook larger.  I think they probably liked Jenkins and Cromartie and Apples because they liked those guys, not because they thought they were exploiting a market inefficiency.  And it's not as if their game plan of ""our offensive line is more talented than your defensive line"" has been effective.  Or sound from it's inception, really.  Does any team with Marshall Newhouse and Ereck Flowers have the right to say ""our offensive line is better than your defensive line""?

You guys tell me: What other unintended consequences of the shortened practice schedules is the NFL experiencing?  You could suggest sagging ratings, but they rebounded pretty hard this weekend.  A lot of the depressed ratings was the election, it seems...",NYGiants,"The Giants are like Every Other Team in the NFL, Only Moreso",https://www.reddit.com/r/NYGiants/comments/5cy3xr/the_giants_are_like_every_other_team_in_the_nfl/
2,2016-11-08 20:58:14+00:00,self.NYGiants,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYGiants/comments/5bvwdg/time_to_get_realstic/,False,"I'm seeing some strange posts on this forum, posts that, quite frankly, make me wonder if some people even bother to watch the games this team is playing.  There are some basic truths about the NYG team that it's about time we acknowledge:

* Jason Pierre Paul is probably washed up.  We've now had 16 games of sample and the results aren't good.  He's got all of 2.5 sacks, which would represent the worst full-season total he's posted in his career.  And it's not like he's suddenly lighting it up in 2016 vs. the second half of 2015.  It's a single sack in 2015 (and an embarassing one at that, against a Panther team that just didn't bother to block him at all on that play) and a sack-and-a-half this year.  That's hardly an upward-pointing trendline.

JPP reported he was going to be much more effective this year during the offseason, but very few of us were stupid enough to believe him *prima facie*.  He was heavily incentivized to say precisely that to secure as lucrative of a contract as possible.  If it turned out he could play, great, he makes a good case for an extension (I'm working out harder now!).  If, on the other hand, it turns out you need two hands to play defensive end (and it looks like that's the case) then at least he extracts out a little more value from what turns out to be his last NFL contract.  Barring a resurgent second half, chances are he's out of the league next year.

* Olivier Vernon has been bad this year.  For all his pressures, his job is to sack the fucking quarterback.  Basically he's replicated JPP's year, only he isn't missing most of his right hand; he's bad because he's been bad.  Sure, maybe he magically gets better in the second half of the year, but keep in mind the Giants don't have a Derrick Shelby to promote to the opposite site of the line to take pressure off Vernon, and they DEFINITELY don't have Ndamukong Suh.  No, we have Owa Odighizuwa, with his 3 (not a typo: THREE) tackles and zero sacks in 2 seasons.

* Victor Cruz is also probably washed up.  I've watched him all year and I can tell you two things.  First, that he started out getting the opponents' second CB, but after a few games that ended and Shepard started getting CB2.  Now Cruz is getting covered by the dregs of the opponents' secondary.  Second, I can tell you that no matter who's guarding him, he's not getting separation.  Almost ever.  The only throw that appears to be working reliably is the back-shoulder out, which doesn't require that Cruz actually ever gets open: He just expects the ball at the right time and the Giants rely upon the corner not turning his head.  Needless to say, this is not sustainable.

I'm not saying I'm happy about Cruz being washed up.  I was rooting for him just as I was rooting for JPP and Cruz to come back.  But Cruz suffered a catastrophic, career-threatening injury in 2014, missed over a season-and-a-half between 2014 and 15, and he been ineffective since coming back.  Oh, and he's turning 30 in 3 days.  It may not **quite** be game over, but right now the score is Torn Patellar Tendon 1, Victor Cruz 0.

It's not an accident that our passing offense and our pass rush are both problematic this year: Three of the most important components of them have disappointed.  Put another way, when your strong safety has more sacks than both your defensive ends *combined*, maybe that's a problem.",NYGiants,Time To Get Realstic,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYGiants/comments/5bvwdg/time_to_get_realstic/

Stuff like:

    SELECT TOP 100
    (
      SELECT 'SomeStringConstant' AS 'name',
        TABLE1.column1 AS 'value'
        FOR XML PATH('metadata'), TYPE
    ),
    (
      SELECT 'SomeOtherStringConstant' AS 'name',
      (
      SELECT
      ' ' + TABLE2.column1 AS 'VALUE'
      FROM TABLE2
      WHERE TABLE1.joincolumn = TABLE2.joincolumn
      FOR XML PATH('')
      ) AS 'value'
    )
    FROM TABLE1
    FOR XML PATH('item'), ROOT('update'), TYPE

This all works.  The first subselect creates a new &lt;metadata&gt; node, with &lt;name&gt; and &lt;value&gt; child nodes, for each matching row.  The second subselect creates a single &lt;metadata&gt; node, and single &lt;name&gt; and &lt;value&gt; nodes, and concatenates all the matches together into one string underneath the &lt;value&gt; node:

    &lt;update&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;metadata&gt;
          &lt;name&gt;SomeStringConstant&lt;/name&gt;
          &lt;value&gt;apple&lt;/value&gt;
        &lt;/metadata&gt;
        &lt;metadata&gt;
          &lt;name&gt;SomeOtherStringConstant&lt;/name&gt;
          &lt;value&gt; apple banana carrot daikon eggplant fig&lt;/value&gt;
        &lt;/metadata&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/update&gt;

But here's my question.  How can I create a series of metadata nodes, all matching different rows matching the same single query, only the &lt;name&gt; values are incremented each time?  So that the data in the second node instead comes out as:

    &lt;metadata&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;SomeIncrementedString1&lt;/name&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;apple&lt;/value&gt;
    &lt;/metadata&gt;
    &lt;metadata&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;SomeIncrementedString2&lt;/name&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;banana&lt;/value&gt;
    &lt;/metadata&gt;
    &lt;metadata&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;SomeIncrementedString3&lt;/name&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;carrot&lt;/value&gt;
    &lt;/metadata&gt;
    &lt;metadata&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;SomeIncrementedString4&lt;/name&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;daikon&lt;/value&gt;

When my brother and I were kids our parents took us to visit my grandparents.  While the adults were upstairs having adult conversations my brother and I were bored, downstairs, looking for something to do.

Well it turns out my grandmother used to be a seamstress, and had a pile of sewing supplies lying around.  So maybe I can use some of that elastic as a proxy for rope, and we can do something cool with that, huh?  Only I need something to cut the elastic, and all I could find was pinking shears...

So I take the elastic, make a loop with it in my left hand, stick the pair of pinking shears, pointed up, into the loop, trying to cut it.  I gotta push pretty hard, and YOINK!  The elastic gives way and I stab myself in the right eyeball with the pinking shears.

I know this is going to be disappointing, but this isn't an NSFW horror story about an eyeball kebab, or blood, or eyeball goo, or whatever.  No, I stuck myself in the eye, and it hurt a little, and then I rubbed my eye and went back to the rest of my life.  Now, later that day, my eyeball really started to itch, and it turns out I'd scratched my cornea, so that meant a trip to the ER, some medicated drops, and an eye patch for a few days.  As well as coming clean to the parents.

But here's the bullet: I scratched my cornea of my **right eye**, and years later, whilst being fitted for a pair of glasses, it turns out my vision in my left eye is 20/125, while the vision in my right (stabbed) eye is 20/25.  My opthamologist agreed: It was probably the scratched cornea from seven years earlier.

I'd performed a half-assed Radial Keratotomy (think LASIK with a diamond scalpel instead of a laser) with a pair of pinking shears.  So there's your happy ending, kids!",tifu,TIFU By Giving Myself LASIK,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/439z8j/tifu_by_giving_myself_lasik/

Now my nephew is going to be 12 and I'd like to get him one for his birthday, but I'm having a spot of difficulty finding one that is both intended for beginners and a kit.  I don't see the point in getting him an RTR:  Half the point is to get him building stuff.

Every time I think of the NY Giants (a team which I've rooted for, for years, thank you very much) I put a revolver in my mouth and start chanting ""Pull da twigguh, you putthy, pull da twigguh!""  The only thing stopping me from pulling the trigger is Odell Beckham, and frankly, even that pick was a fuckup.  The better player (and the best player in that draft, full stop) went one pick later.

Reese's drafting sucks.  The Giants have been in steady, inexorable decline over the past few years because of shit drafting, interrupted only by the glorious glowy awesomeness that is Beckham, but one wide reciever doesn't erase a half-decade of incompetence.  Oh, and if you're going to argue about Reese's drafting, and point out that JPP in 2010, let's keep some perspective:  The guy had one good year, when Umeniora and Tuck were still on the team, and he just missed 8 games this year because he was busy [murdering Richard Kimball's wife.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fugitive_%281993_film%29)",NYGiants,"This is Why The Giants are Terrible, and Getting Worse...",https://www.reddit.com/r/NYGiants/comments/3t2n52/this_is_why_the_giants_are_terrible_and_getting/
