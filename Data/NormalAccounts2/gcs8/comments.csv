Wiki says: 

&gt; Malanjkhand Copper Project was inaugurated by Prime Minister Smt. Indira Gandhi in 1980 and Hindustan Copper Limited started to exploit the copper ore through open pit mining. Geological Survey of India took systematic geological exploration at this deposit during 1969. Mining lease of the ore was granted to HCL during 1973. With advancement of time this project was enhanced with viable operational developments.In fact it is largest open cast mining in Asia.

&gt; This area is the result of Many cycles of erosion on the gneiss base during the Amgaon orogeny. Although it provided employment to many villages around which would have been impossible otherwise, still locals were not skilled enough to be employed so they feel cheated and hence they feel justice hasn't been done to them.Also the leftover of the refining process called tailing ends up in the fields of these villagers are hurting their crops and cattle.

124,"&gt; Vartak had been suffering from high blood pressure for the past 20 years. As he reached the SBI bank branch and was climbing the stairs leading to the bank, he started feeling giddy and his hands and legs started to shiver,” More said. 

.

&gt; According to a medical officer, who was part of the autopsy, it seemed that Vartak had suffered a heart attack. “He was battling no illness and was healthy. But his heart was weak due to old age,” the medical officer said.


People with high BP over such long periods have weak hearts by such old age. It is obvious that the stress of climbing stairs did him in. Poor guy lived 20 years with BP but finally demonetization made him climb stairs of a bank that gave him a heart attack.

Suketu is a classist-chauvinist who masquerades as a serious chronicler of the city. [From my comment on an earlier thread:](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/37j8lp/visiting_bombay_in_julyaugust/crnb5lm/)

&gt; &gt; A name is such that if you grow up with it you get attached to it, whatever its origins. I grew up on Nepean Sea Road, which is now Lady Laxmibai Jagmohandas Marg. I have no idea who Sir Ernest Nepean was nor do I know who Lady Laxmibai Jagmohandas was, but I am attached to the original name and see no reason why it should change. The name has acquired a resonance, over time, distinct from its origin; as Rue Pascal or West 4th Street or Maiden Lane might ahve for someone who has grown up in those cities. I got used to the sound of it. It is incorporated into my address, into my dream life. I can come back to Nepean Sea Road; if some municipal functionary bent on exacting revenge on history changes it to Lady Laxmibai Jagmohandas Marg, he is doing a disservice to my memory.

&gt; &gt; Name-changing is in vogue all over India nowadays: Madras has been renamed Chennai; Calcutta, that British-made city, has changed its name to Kolkata. A BJP member of parliament has demanded that India's name be changed to Bharat. This is a process not just of decolonization but of de-Islamicization. The idea is to go back not just to past but an idealized past, in all cases a Hindu past. But to change a name, for a person or a road or a city, there had better be a very good reason. And there was no good reason to change the name of Bombay. It is nonsense to say that Mumbai was the original name. Bombay was created by the Portuguese and the British from a cluster of malarial islands, and to them should go the baptismal rights. The Gujuratis and Maharashtrians always called it Mumbai when speaking Gujurati or Marathi, and Bombay when speaking English. There was no need to choose. In 1995, the Sena demanded that we choose, in all our languages, Mumbai. This is how the ghatis took revenge on us. They renamed everything after their politicians, and finally they renamed even the city. If they couldn't afford to live on our roads, they could at least occupy the road signs.

&gt; Mehta's resistance seems to be a conflation two rather different sorts of issues. He first mentions the renaming of Bombay's streets and chowks (corners), before he gets to the renaming of the city; he seems to be considering them as of a piece. On the one hand, he is clinging to the place names he grew up with, out of what might be called nostalgia. He points out that there is a significant degree of corruption behind the street-name changes going on in Bombay. He also points out (rightly, from my experience) that practically no one knows the names of the minor figures who get slices of the city named after them. The names aren't being used. In my view, this argument is a bit self-indulgent, but I don't see that he will generate a great deal of vehement opposition.

&gt; The name of the city is a different matter, and his statements on it now seem (after hearing people's objections) a little sloppy. Unlike Lady Laxmibai Jagmohandas Marg (which no taxi driver in Bombay is likely to recognize), the name of a city is big enough that its official name absolutely does matter, both to inhabitants and to others; it can't be cheekily ignored. Further, I gather that a pretty substantial number of people actually use the new name. In my experience, the people who are most likely to resist it are the ""English-medium"" educated Indians -- who also happen constitute the bulk of my friends and family. But I'm willing to accept that large numbers of Indians now accept the name ""Mumbai,"" even when speaking English. Non-Indians are forced to accept the name by default.

&gt; Mehta should probably have kept the two issues separate.

&gt; One further thought: It also seems to me that Mehta's class bias is a little unbecoming in the passage quoted above. The line about the 'revenge of the ghatis' is a reference to the following paragraph from earlier in the book:

&gt; &gt;  I did not know many Maharashtrians when I was growing up. There was the world I lived in on Nepean Sea Road, and there was nother world whose people came to wash our clothes, look at our electric meters, drive our cars, inhabit our nightmares. We lived in Bombay and never had much to do with Mumbai. Maharashtra to us was our servants, the banana lady downstairs, the textbooks we were force-fed in school. We had a term for them: ghatis--literally, the people from the ghats, or hills. It was also the word we used, generically, for ""servant."" 


&gt; Mehta is well aware of the power of a slur (this book as a whole is quite sensitive to the question of the language one uses), so it's unclear to me why he allows this one to slip out unchallenged in the passage about ""Mumbai.""

_______________________________________________________


Rohinton Mistry is an outright cheapskate:   

&gt; Such a Long Journey was withdrawn from the syllabus of Mumbai University since it contained, in the perspective of some character in the book, discriminatory and derogatory remarks about Maharashtrians and abusive languages about Bal Thackeray, leader of Shiv Sena, a political party from Maharashtra. In the book, the character Dinshawji angrily recounts an incident with a dabbawala who's rude to him, stating ""What to do with such low-class people? No manners, no sense, nothing. And you know who is responsible for this attitude — that bastard Shiv Sena leader who worships Hitler and Mussolini. He and his 'Maharashtra for Maharashtrians' nonsense. They won’t stop till they have complete Maratha Raj.…Wait till the Marathas take over, then we will have real Gandoo Raj.""

[Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Such_a_Long_Journey_%28novel%29#Withdrawal_from_Mumbai_University.27s_syllabus).


He was understandably perturbed at his work being dropped from the Mumbai University syllabus. This is what he had to say:

&gt; “The Shiv Sena's student wing complains to the Vice-Chancellor of Mumbai University that it is offended by the novel ‘Such a Long Journey.' Copies are burnt at the University gates. Needless to say, no one has actually read the book. The mob leader, speaking in Hindi to a television camera, says: The author is lucky he lives in Canada — if he were here, we would burn him as well. The mob demands the book's removal, within twenty-four hours, from the syllabus. The good Vice-Chancellor obliges the mob. 

&gt; “All this happened in September. Subsequently, the Shiv Sena sent fulsome congratulations to the Vice-Chancellor on his prompt and wise decision. Students and faculty protested the abomination, unwilling to accept his abuse of power, his invoking of emergency measures unused in the University's hundred and fifty-three-year history, circumventing the process for syllabus change, damaging the University's reputation, succumbing to political pressure. For days, the Vice-Chancellor said nothing, offered no explanation. He is, we are told, a Ph.D. in statistics — a useful subject for dealing with permutations, combinations, probabilities but silent on the matter of moral responsibility. In this sorry spectacle of book-burning and book-banning, the Shiv Sena has followed its depressingly familiar, tediously predictable script of threats and intimidation that Mumbai has endured since the organisation's founding in 1966. But it is the expeditious decision by Mumbai University which causes profound dismay. After his long silence, the Vice-Chancellor has now stated that he, in fact, followed the correct procedures, and the decision was taken by the Board of Studies. The outgoing Board of Studies, to be precise. More bobbing, weaving, and slippery behaviour is no doubt in the offing. But one thing remains: a political party demanded an immediate change in syllabus, and Mumbai University provided deluxe service via express delivery, making the book disappear the very next day. The University, in the person of the Vice-Chancellor, occupies an exalted position in civilised society, the champion of academic independence and freedom of expression. Instead, Mumbai University has come perilously close to institutionalising the ugly notion of self-censorship. The Vice-Chancellor knows what he must do to remove the stain.

&gt; “This sordid story, however, does have a bright spot. Civil society has responded, in Mumbai and elsewhere, with outrage, questions, petitions; it is inspiring to see. The stand taken by teachers, citizens' groups, bloggers, journalists is exemplary. Who knows, it may even educate the main actors about the workings of a real democracy.

&gt; “As for the grandson of the Shiv Sena leader, the young man who takes credit for the whole pathetic business, who admits to not having read the book, just the few lines that offend him and his bibliophobic brethren, he has now been inducted into the family enterprise of parochial politics, anointed leader of its newly minted “youth wing.” What can — what should — one feel about him? Pity, disappointment, compassion? Twenty years old, in the final year of a B.A. in history, at my own Alma Mater, the beneficiary of a good education, he is about to embark down the Sena's well-trodden path, to appeal, like those before him, to all that is worst in human nature.

&gt; “Does he have to? No. He is clearly equipped to choose for himself. He could lead, instead of following, the old regime. He could say something radical — that burning and banning books will not feed one hungry soul, will not house one homeless person nor will it provide gainful employment to anyone [unless one counts those hired to light bonfires], not in Mumbai, not in Maharashtra, not anywhere, not ever.

&gt; “He can think independently, and he can choose. And since he is drawn to books, he might want to read, carefully this time, from cover to cover, a couple that would help him make his choice. Come to think of it, the Vice-Chancellor, too, may find them beneficial. First, Conrad's Heart of Darkness, in order to consider the options: step back from the abyss, or go over the edge. Next, the Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore's Gitanjali. And I would urge particular attention to this verse: ‘Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high; Where knowledge is free; Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls;...Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake'.”

223,"&gt; *note to idiots: calling demonetization a ""surgical strike"" is like comparing burning the house down to kill one cockroach to swatting a mosquito with the electric racket.

Erm, idiot chiming in.. Isn't it a 'surgical strike' on black money because demonetization *per se* renders unaccounted money valueless while all that can be accounted for enriches the holder?

Of course, all the hardship being caused does indicate we're collateral damage.

&gt; BJP had opposed the UPA government’s decision in 2014 to withdraw all currency notes issued prior to 2005.

 

&gt; Lekhi as an Opposition leader vociferously targeted the Centre and Finance Minister P Chidambaram on its impact on the common people.

 

&gt; She had then said the present scheme does nothing to remove black money from circulation.

&gt; Lekhi as an Opposition leader vociferously targeted the Centre and Finance Minister P Chidambaram on its impact on the common people.

 

&gt; She had then said the present scheme does nothing to remove black money from circulation.

 

 

&gt; “The present government is unable to measure the correct quantum of black money as those who have black money will convert into new currency notes and the sufferers are the aam aurats and the aam aadmis. Those who are illiterate and have no access to the banking facilities will be the ones affected by such diversionary measures,” Lekhi had then said.

 

&gt; “The latest gimmick of finance ministry to demonetise the notes before 2005 is an attempt to obfuscate the issue of black money stashed outside the country… This measure is strongly anti-poor,” she added.

In the six-page suicide note, he had **drawn a diagram on how he was going to end his life** and also mentioned the names of five students, including two girl students, of other colleges.

.


&gt; He had also alleged that these students had given supari to a goon to kill him. Sachinkumar had said in the note that it was the goon who had told him of the murder plan and was trying to kill him since October 26. He said he had narrowly escaped once. Since it became evident that he was going to be bumped off, he decided to kill himself, the note said.

&gt; Though the boy felt he should file a complaint to police or bring these incidents to his family, he did not take that step as he was **already under foster care and didn't want to trouble his uncle and grandparents further**.

450,"&gt; How can the government punish media? Surely that right must rest with the judiciary. 

The Government very well can do it. While NDTV also has the right to approach the Courts. Here:

&gt; Even without the mandate to regulate their content, the government has a handle on channels through the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995. All companies that seek to set up a broadcast network in India need licences to uplink and downlink their channel(s). The permission to set up the network is given by the I&amp;B Ministry through powers vested in it by the 1995 Act.

&gt; Also, there are the Cable Television Network Rules, 1995, which must be read along with the Act. Part 6 of the Rules is the Programme Code, which is in the nature of broad guidelines in the form of do’s and don’ts. [Part 7 of the Rules is the Advertising Code.] While compliance with the Programme Code remains technically voluntary, the government can, because of the Code’s association with the Rules and the Act, use it to lean on channels.

This was a reference to the fact that NDTV correspondent had said, “two terrorists are alive and are next to an ammunition depot”.

&gt; To NDTV India’s point that other news outlets had also disclosed much of the same information that it had been accused of in the show cause notice, the final order went on to make a distinction between news available on TV, versus what people and the militants’ handlers may be able to access via print or digital news outlets.

487,"&gt; Shivaji was a monarch as well. As was Jhansi ki rani. All of these people were monarchs fighting for their own land, not fighting for India or whatever garbage we've been fed. 

It's sad and outrageous how lies go unchallenged on this discussion forum especially when it's about Shivaji or Rani Laxmibai, while stone-pelters and assorted subversives are defended with full gusto. The zeal to whitewash religious zealots who persecuted Hindus for just being Hindus, and a strategy of forced equivalence are exactly what's wrong with Indian 'secularism'.

Here:

&gt; After the murder of Afzal Khan Shahji began to advance with his troops to assist his son for capturing Bijapur, but the scheme was given up when the old warrior learnt the withdrawal of the Maratha forces. Thus Swaraj and Hindvi Swaraj were ideals before Shivaji from 1645. Nothing succeeds like success. In the beginning it was a day-dream impossible to be realized. Hence all important persons kept themselves aloof from the arch rebel. But as the dream began to be transformed into a reality, more and more Maratha nobles joined him in this holy cause. 

&gt; Now it is manifest that Shivaji for the first time used the magnetic words ""Hindvi Swaraj"" which have become popular since then. It should be noted that it was not merely Swaraj for Maharashtra, not even Swaraj for the Hindus, but an All-Indian Swaraj. He was against foreign rule and religious persecutions. He even tried to win the Irdian Muslims to his cause and made an alliance against the foreign Pathans, Moguls and Persians. As the Muslim rulers were fanatically engaged in the unholy work of forcible conversions, he was ultimately led to subvert Muslim rule in India and establish Hindu Swaraj in the whole of India. A few evidences are culled below to manifest his noble ideal of Indian independence. 

&gt; 1. His ambitious programme of conquest is significantly indicated by the motto engraved on his royal seal. It was fixed to each important document, and reminded him and the world the ultimate ideal of the hero. ""This seal of Shivaji, son of Shahji, rules for the welfare of the people. This world-worshipped seal is desirous of growing like the new moon into a full moon."" This seal can be traced to 1639. Shivaji was merely a boy of 9 years. The ideal was probably put before him by his astute father. 

&gt; 2. Even in 1665, the letter written by Shivaji to Mirza Raja Jaismgh, puts forth his whole programme and ideal in unequivocal terms. (Vol. I, p. 247). 

&gt; 3. His conquest of Southern India as far as Tanjore and covering a large part of the Vijayanagar Empire, took him nearer his ideal. 

&gt; 4. His system of veiled subsidies from the two Muslim Kingdoms of the Deccan, was the recognition of his suzerainty over them. In outward form and in name it may be a gift made by a friendly power to an aggressor to cease from hostility and also to keep away others from aggression. It was really a tribute, and it lias been so called by the Maratha chronicles. 

&gt; 5. The system of Chauth was a powerful instrument to impose the suzerainty of the Marathas on non-Maratha territories. The successors of Shivaji widely used this instrument of augmenting the empire by bringing in chauth paying protectorates. 

&gt; 6. Shiva followed the subtle policy of exciting the Rajputs against Aurangzeb for becoming independent. In his letter to Jaisingh he pleaded for a union of northein and southern Hindu rulers, for bringing about the overthrow of the Muslim domination. In pursuit of this policy he advised Chhatrasal to return to his 
country and begin the fight for independence in the heart of the empire. This policy was finally crowned with success, since the Bundhelas dealt severe blows to the empire and dissipated its resources. 

&gt; 7. Shivaji went to seek the blessing of saint Parmanand for the conquest of Rajapur. He offered the saint in gift a village for every fort conquered by him, but the Swami declined to accept the offer and demanded villages in the unconquered provinces of Hyderabad, Berar, Khandesh, Baglan, Malwa and Gujerat. The Maharaja understood the implication of the demand. "" All these provinces are now bestowed upon me,"" said he, "" through your blessing these will be annexed by me."" A similar offer is said to have been made by Samarth Ramdas. Thus saints encouraged Shivaji in strengthening his imperial idea of conqueiing the whole 
of India.

&gt; 8. We have H. Gary's evidence that ""Shivaji had vowed to his pagod ( Goddess Bhavani ) never to sheath his sword till he had reached Delhi and shut up Aurangshah in it."" 

&gt; 9. Dr. Fryer too has fortunately recorded the views of Shivaji. ' He tells them, his compeers the Duccanees, he is their champion, and that none of them besides himself has the heart to stand up for their country : and therefore if he chance now and then to rob them, it is but to reward himself and soldiers for his and their pains in endeavouring to free them from a more unnatural slavery.""* 


&gt; 10. The 91 Q. Chronicle informs us that during his conversation with Tana Shah, Shivaji observed that if the two kingdoms of Golconda and Bijapur assisted him, he would conquer for them the whole of Hindustan. 

&gt; 11. The Chitragupta Chronicle ( P. 131 ) records that Shivaji expressed regret to his son Sambhaji that only one object of his remained unfulfilled and that was the conquest of Delhi by making Aurangzeb absolutely helpless. However time was to show how for his goddess Amba would favour this design. 

&gt; 12. One more testimony is to be found in Shivaji's letter to Maloji Ghorpade. The latter was persuaded lo leave the cause of Bijapur, and join Shivaji and Kutubshah in stamping out foreign rule from the Deccan. ' It is not a good thing that the Pathans came to possess the Fadshahi of the Deccan. If they become powerful, they will destroy the families of the Deccani nobles one after the other. They will not allow any one to live. The Pathans should be destroyed, and steps should be taken to keep the Padshahi of the Deccan in the hands of the Deccanees. After an agreement was accepted by both sides, we also thought that whatever Marathas are of our caste, they should be taken into the confederacy and should be introduced to Kutubshah."" 

&gt; 13. The last will and testament of Shivaji is significant in showing his ideals and ambitious programmes. He exhorted his officers to put forth all their energy for the extension of the Maratha kingdom to the further most confines of India and for capturing the throne of Delhi; to free the sacred Ganges from the yoke of the Muslims; to cross the Indus and implant the Maratha flag in the trans-Indus Himalayas. 'It was my intense desire to conquer the whole of India, but I have not fulfilled it on account of my premature death. You should all attempt to realize this high ideal. The kingdom founded by me should be consolidated and extended ""with more heroism than I have ever exhibited.""

&gt; 'The English are no ordinary traders and money-lenders, behind them stands the power of a mighty State. They are also so clever that they will steal from right under your nose without you knowing it. Be very cautious while dealing with them,' Shivaji wrote to one of his officers.

&gt; Interestingly, the last battle Shivaji fought was against the English. He occupied and fortified the island of Khanderi, 16 kms south of Mumbai, in order to keep the British under check.

&gt; He was amongst the few Indians who understood the long-term threat posed by the British.

&gt; In the global context, the tide of Islam, which rose in the first millennium, had swept everything before it. In Europe it was Charles Martel of France who checked it, while in Asia the Muslim armies conquests swept aside the ancient civilisation of Persia and the Zorastrian faith.

&gt; A handful of Zorastrians found refuge in India and the faith survived. Buddhist Afghanistan and most of north India also fell prey to these invasions.

&gt; While many Muslim rulers were quite content to let the ancient Indian faith survive, some like Aurangzeb made a determined bid to Islamise India. India escaped the fate of Persia due to the resistance offered by the Marathas to the Mughals from 1682 to 1707.

&gt; Shivaji was dead, but his example and ideals survived and were the main source for inspiration for the Marathas in their desperate struggle with the mighty Mughal empire.

&gt;  Mumbai is one of the most liberal cities in India when it comes to attitudes to alcohol. Bars exist at virtually every street corner and many of them advertise themselves as ""family"" bars and restaurants, which indicates that they are primarily restaurants where one can also have a drink. Other places are primarily bars, some of them might be sleazy. In South Mumbai and in the Western suburbs, you are likely to find many places where foreigners hang out.

&gt; Mumbai is much more accepting of women drinking than the rest of India. A woman ordering a drink is unlikely to raise eyebrows even in mid-range bars, though if you are alone, you might need to look out for your safety.

Alright.

&gt; Also, culture is not a product of language. You can talk about Diwali, Roja, Lent, respect for elders, hospitality, jalebis and ghazals in any language you want.

Culture and language are closely linked. For example, how will exclusively English-speaking Varkaris sing paeans to Vitthal as the Marathis do via *abhang*s? Does 'पुजाऱ्याने मुलाला कुरवाळले' have the exact same connotations as 'the priest fondled the boy'?
 
&gt; Does language shape culture? Definitely. Does it do so in a unique way? (i.e. if we suddenly started speaking Chinese tomorrow, will our culture change) No empirical evidence that I've seen, so I have to rely on inference.

What have you assumed before coming to said inference, that the day 'we suddenly started speaking Chinese', all our books, etymologies of festivals and places too will be Chinese? How will this scenario of us 'suddenly started speaking Chinese' negate the effect of all of the collected material that we built up as people of a culture and language?

&gt; Since I can convey every single facet of Diwali using just English, I'm led to believe that it's not tied to Hindi or Marathi, or even Sanskrit. The only thing lost in translation is the language.

And yet, the finest stumbled when translating the works of someone like Ramakrishna Paramahansa from Bengali to English, and in the process erroneously deducing that he was a closeted homosexual. All this just because of differences in perception of the same things in Bengali and English.
 
&gt; But if we fight to retain the language instead of the culture itself, it's gone forever. We'll be talking about Libertarianism in spashta utkrushta Marathi.

Again, that's because language is vanguard of culture. *Batatyachi Chaal* will never be the same in English or Spanish.",2016-10-31 19:37:44+00:00,d9fsqai,6.0,t1_d9fmdsw,7312.0,india

&gt; ""The biggest event which promotes western culture is Sunburn which goes on for three days. Who will stop it?

&gt; Statistics revealed that the highest number of persons released on parole were from Punjab (10,861), followed by Madhya Pradesh (5,340), Tamil Nadu (5,327), Haryana (4,411), Gujarat (3,248), West Bengal (1,878), Rajasthan (1,825) and Maharashtra (1,670), among others.

&gt; पाकिस्तानी कलाकार असलेल्या करण जोहर यांच्या ‘ए दिल है मुश्किल’ चित्रपटाच्या प्रदर्शनाचा मार्ग मुख्यमंत्र्यांच्या मध्यस्थीनंतर शनिवारी मोकळा झाला. मात्र, तत्पूर्वी दोन दिवस आधीच वर्षा बंगल्यावर मुख्यमंत्री देवेंद्र फडणवीस आणि राज ठाकरे यांच्या भेटीदरम्यान झालेल्या ‘गुफ्तगू’मध्ये हा तोडगा ठरला होता. आगामी मुंबई महापालिका निवडणुकीच्या पार्श्वभूमीवर शिवसेनेला इशारा म्हणून मनसेला झुकते माप देण्याची खेळी करून मुख्यमंत्र्यांनी हा मार्ग काढला असल्याचे समजते.

&gt; या वादात कुणाची सरशी किंवा कुणाची माघार हा मुद्दा न ठेवता भाजप व मनसेने आपापली राजकीय अडचण टाळण्यासाठी हा समझोता घडवून आणल्याची चर्चा राजकीय वर्तुळात रंगली आहे.


&gt; **५ कोटीच्या प्रस्तावाचाही वाद**

&gt; भारतीय सैनिक कल्याण निधीला ५ कोटी रुपयांची देणगी देण्याचा प्रस्ताव शनिवारी राज ठाकरे यांनी बैठकीत मांडलाच नव्हता. राज यांनी त्यांचा ५ कोटींचा प्रस्ताव चित्रपट निर्मात्यांनी मान्य केल्याची खोटी माहिती माध्यमांना दिल्याचे प्रोड्युसर्स गिल्डचे मुकेश भट्ट यांनी ‘दिव्य मराठी’ला सांगितले.


Translation:


&gt; The way for exhibition of the Karan Johar movie 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil' which features a Pakistani actor was cleared after mediation by the Chief Minister this Saturday. But this solution was already formulated at a meeting between Devendra Fadnavis and Raj Thackeray at 'Varsha' bunglow two days earlier. It is understood that on the backdrop of impending elections to the Municipal Corporation of Mumbai, the Chief Minister intended this to be a warning to the Shiv Sena by giving kid glove treatment to MNS.

&gt; Political circles are rife with talk that this arrangement was a just a convenient maneuver by which the BJP and MNS could evade political vexations and yet no party would come out appearing the winner or loser.


&gt; **The controversy of the 5 Crore suggestion**

&gt; Raj Thackeray had not placed any suggestion about donating five crore rupees at all during the meeting this Saturday. That the suggestion to donate five crore rupees by Raj Thackeray was accepted by movie producers was a lie that was fed to news media, Mukesh Bhat of Producers' Guild told Divya Marathi.

673,"&gt; There is an unacceptable diversity in language and religion- refer to Catholics vs Protestants and many other such religious clashes in Europe.

What?! We haven't had such clashes, is what you're saying?

&gt; India also has different identities- language, religion, etc., but what we have is civilizational continuity and commonness. 

And Europeans don't?

&gt; What was common in the Harappan civilisation in the N-W of India can be witnessed even today in the remote villages of the south. 

Like what?


&gt; Yes, there are obstacles, but we still uphold it

At some cost, do you agree?

&gt; Balkanization of India is dangerous. It damages the growth potential of the country. And, I must say, there are few groups who want this to happen- to break India, and let India not be in the race for the global superpower, because we can be strong-armed easily if we live in small countries.


Is Balkanization *within* India okay? Before the Linguistic Reorganization of States, the dominant thinking in political circles was that formation of states on the basis of language might encourage secessionism. Hence the fear of large states that could stand up to the Centre which has always favored pliable dispensations in states that will quietly do their bidding. Like how a 'selected' Fadnavis meekly surrenders to the Centre these days. Do you also think smaller states within India will allow a more powerful Centre to strong arm those states into submission especially in an era of GST?",2016-10-23 16:59:55+00:00,d94ej3v,3.0,t1_d94cv7l,2332.0,india

Sustaining 'Mumbai and satellite cities' comes at a cost that the people of Maharashtra pay to this day.


In a nation that witnessed a CM of a large state lose elections and admit on national television, when there's no electricity how could he get a *bijli ka jhatka* after a reporter asked him if it was the frequent and long electricity supply interruptions that did him in, Mumbai's admirably reliable power system had a troubled start - the [first ever anti-dam movement in the world](http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/the-worlds-first-antidam-movement/article1437414.ece) arising out of the displacement of nearly 10,000 farmers more than a hundred kilometers from the city on whom [boiling water was thrown to break the protest](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1qffwf/the_mavlas_of_mulshi_displacements_earliest/) and some of who haven't received compensation *to this day*, from the businessmen to whom their land was given for generating electricity to provide to Mumbai.




In a state that is frequently ravaged by severe droughts, Mumbai stands out as a city that still gets good supply of drinking water and has 'arrangements' to ensure this status for the next few decades. How? By drawing water from and 'reserving' natural water bodies situated well outside Mumbai region, deep inside the rest of the state. Unfortunately, this is not told to Mumbaikars who then ignorantly lament how the rest of the state is a big drag on their city - google 'Damanganga Pinjal link' and you'll find scores of obscure articles that state it is a project to provide water to meet the current and future water requirements of 'Mumbai and satellite cities'. What these articles rarely tell you is that this is going to deprive farmers of Nashik (which is a catchment area for those rivers), of water despite that Nashik itself has had to face drought! What almost none of these articles will tell you is that some of this water is going to be diverted to Gujarat! Moreover, this water diverted to Gujarat will be from Maharashtra's allotted quota!

730,"&gt;  The **National Federation of Indian Women** has voiced strong opposition to a proposed film festival celebrating homosexuality, a federation spokeswoman said Wednesday. The film festival is scheduled to begin in late December to coincide with a conference in India of the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission.

&gt; The vice president of the Indian woman's federation said both the film festival and conference would be 'an invasion of the country by decadent western culture.' 'Liberalization of the economy has already led to an electronic media blitz by the West,' woman's federation vice president Vimla Farooqui said. 'When hundreds of foreigners participate in the conference the media will report it, violating the minds of the youth,' she said. Farooqui on behalf of the woman's federation has urged Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao to block the conference and help preserve what she called traditional India culture. A growing number of conservative Indian interest groups have expressed concern over the increasing prevalence of western ideas in Indian culture. What, by western standards, would seem tame on the television and film screen, is often deemed obscene by many Indian groups. Over the past few years, India has been exposed to a vast array of popular British, U.S. and Australian television shows, including soap operas, films and music videos. According to India's District Women's Development Agency, more and more rural Indian men are becoming unhappy with their wives after watching pornographic videos. A number of unsophisticated rural brides have been abandoned when they prove unable to match their husbands' sexual expectations, the woman's group said.

&gt; A man claimed to be an NCP leader and human rights activist spoiled a fund raising event organised by the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) community with the help of police on Friday. Later, it came to light that he was a fake.

&gt; More than 100 LGBT community members, who were into the party mood at Oshiwara’s plush gay lounge on Friday night, had to spend the night in a police station.

&gt; The LGBT groups were partying and raising the funds under the banner of Queer Azaadi Mumbai. Claiming to be a prominent NCP leader and president of International Human Right Organization, Ahmed Sahab Bawa (28) allegedly complained to the Oshiwara police that an illegal party was underway at the lounge. Bawa made Oshiwara police believe that he was indeed an NCP stalwart.

&gt; Humsafar Trust (an LGBT group) CEO Vivek Anand told DNA, “The party was organised to raise funds for our annual ‘Pride Walk’ scheduled for 21st to 28th Jan. At around 11:45pm two policemen in plain clothes came to the party along with a man who introduced himself as Ahmed Sahab Bawa, an NCP leader.”

&gt; Anand alleges, “On Bawa’s behest, the police started checking all the licences regarding liquor, music etc. We were asked to stop the party saying that we had not sought permission. We were the asked to come to the police station as Bawa has given a written complaint against us.”

&gt; Another gay activist Sriniwas, who was present in the party, alleged, “Bawa tried creating panic by shouting ‘media ko bulao’.

&gt; He shouted homosexuality is illegal and the party must be stopped immediately. He had earlier walked into the party as a regular guest and had taken pictures and videos of the people without their permission in the party and threatened that this will be shared to the media.”

&gt; According to eye witnesses, the police asked the crowd to move to Oshiwara police station where both the sides would be heard. Upon reaching, the party organisers were made to wait for an hour, while Ahmed was in the station giving his statement. He was later escorted by the police safely.

&gt; The police have another version. Senior police inspector Dilip Rupawate told DNA, “Ahmad (Bawa) had complained to us that he was not allowed to enter the party and that somepeople beat him.

&gt; We are bound to inquire into the case when someone complaints to us. That’s why we went to the party to verify if there is anything illegal. We found nothing against the rule and therefore the party was allowed to continue.”

&gt; He also said, “Ahmed could not recognise the person who beat him. Therefore, we told Ahmed that he should not have gone to the party to begin with.”

&gt; When DNA spoke to Ahmed, he said, “I am not an NCP leader. I am only a **supporter**. I am an advisor of Rashtriya Ulema Council. I am against gays. What does this community wants to tell society?

A delegation led by youth wing president Narendra Verma called on **governor Mohammad Fazal** on Monday and submitted a memorandum outlining the demand.
""The playing of the national anthem would help check the atmosphere which has been vitiated by terrorism and it will also rouse the spirit of patriotism among the people,"" Mr Verma said.

&gt; It will also help create a feeling of unity among the people, who are sought to be divided on communal and casteist lines, he reasoned.

&gt; Mr Fazal assured the delegation that he would convey the demand to the government.

&gt; “Mahajan’s eagerness to bypass the authorities gave the impression of an attempted cover-up by the government and led to immediate eruption of violence in the district,” she alleges.


She's right:

&gt; बताया जाता है कि नासिक के पालक मंत्री गिरीश महाजन के बयान पर लोग तुरंत हिंसा पर उतारू हो गए। उन्होंने कहा था कि यह दुष्कर्म नहीं है, बल्कि दुष्कर्म की कोशिश है।

For example, it would be wrong to criticize to BJP for minority appeasement of Jains had other parties not indulged in minority appeasement too. Hence the 'BJP did it too' type of comments.

'Strong' criticism by self-confessed BJP supporters on a forum where the narrative is dictated by voting patterns doesn't amount to much. BJP rules the nation today, it is the party with the most funds and is active on many fronts. Naturally, there would be a lot of happenings that may portray it in negative light. But the manner in which critical submissions are *generally* prevented from reaching the front page preempts a lot of such 'strong' criticism by good BJP supporters like you from reaching the audience here.

Similarly, behaviour that may be imperfect by international standards can be quite good for a particular neighbourhood.

&gt; Is buying an IBM server tantamount to supporting Nazism? 

Their statement on the issue needs consideration:


&gt; Recently a paperback edition of the Edwin Black book has appeared with additional speculation regarding the use of IBM-made equipment in Poland during World War II.

&gt; As we said last year when the book first appeared: The Nazi regime used equipment manufactured by IBM's German subsidiary; that has been well-known for decades. That, and other well-known facts about IBM, were the basis of allegations in last year's book and appear to be used in similar fashion in the new segments in the just-issued paperback. There are no new findings here.

&gt; Since its publication, the research behind the book and the conclusions reached by its author have been questioned. A review in The New York Times concluded that the author's ""... case is long and heavily documented, and yet he does not demonstrate that I.B.M. bears some unique or decisive responsibility for the evil that was done."" Another assessment of the book by a well-regarded academic expert called the original charges ""implausible"" and the book ""deplorable.""

&gt; In addition, Mr. Black is asserting that IBM is withholding materials regarding this era in its archives. There is no basis for such assertions and we deplore the use of such claims to sell books.

&gt; IBM will continue to cooperate and support legitimate research. IBM turned over archival materials on this subject to reputable universities, and Mr. Black is well aware of this fact, despite his claims to the contrary. The company has also made it clear that if additional documents related to this era are found, IBM will make those materials available as well.",2016-10-13 04:40:50+00:00,d8pv7na,7.0,t1_d8pb751,29046.0,india

&gt; China is feeling this backlash already as the world's patience has worn thin with all their talk of ""market reform"" but little has been done in the last few years Same with their dumping their overcapacity on the world markets. As a result, China is not going to get the coveted ""market economy status"" they want from the EU or US. It's steel products are getting duties, so is its solar panels. It is locked out of TTP.

936,"&gt; Right, but the anti-foreign factor is a consumer sentiment. 

Which is driven by propaganda of the company and allied organizations :

&gt; The company’s products are sold under the 'swadeshi' plank and even the Mahatma is invoked for the brand’s further success. Baba Ramdev said in an interview to Economic Times that he has urged shopkeepers to prominently display the company’s products as it will help “in fulfilling the dream of Mahatma Gandhi to promote Swadeshi”.

.

&gt; All business persons have political connections. But in the case of Patanjali, Ramdev, Balkrishna and the BJP there are striking similarities, especially when it comes to the ideology of swadeshi, which translates into pop patriotism.

&gt; This is evident in the aggressive advertisements the company releases (which anyway go against their stated not-for-profit motive). A case in point is the freedom ads that were released coinciding with 15 August, which seemed like an attempt to cash in on the prevailing sentiment of pop patriotism. Through the advertisement, the company exhorted Indians to come out of the clutches of the multinationals, even comparing them to the East India Company of yore - a symbol of colonisation. The ads showed how Patanjali as a brand conveniently married pop patriotism and business.

Piyush Pandey, executive chairman and national creative director of Ogilvy &amp; Mather India and vice-chairman of O&amp;M Asia-Pacific, had termed these advertisements as 'negative'.

&gt; The Police have justification for keeping the migrants under surveillance. Some of the incidents such as the arrest of a Maoist leader of Andhra Pradesh
state from a hideout among migrant labourers in 2007 and the arrest of two migrant workers in connection with the killing of a fellow local worker resulted
in giving more attention to the migrant labourers. The Police have been collecting details such as photograph, residential address of the labourer, nearest police
station to his residence and also names of contact persons to verify the information given by the migrant labourer. Some instances of how the police
respond to the situation is worth citing. In a meeting of one of the residents' associations in the city, a Police Officer in the local police station is reported to
have warned the residents of the need for taking additional precautions while renting out the premises to the migrants. While, it may be justifiable to some
extent seen from the crime detection angle, the message that is passed on to the local people can act against accessing houses by the migrants. The researcher
and a few other local people were having tea in a wayside tea shop. Two migrant workers from North India were also waiting for tea. A police jeep stopped
in front of the tea shop and the inspector singled out the migrant workers and questioned their whereabouts. Bewilderment and shame were visible in their
faces. The incident did not evoke any sympathy among the local residents. In terms of physical safety outside the work place, the migrant workers
are relatively safe though a few incidents of minor clashes between local people and migrants have been reported recently. But it appears that there is a need to
improve their sense of security. A labourer from Orissa told us ""We need to be cautious always. When someone goes out we tell them to be careful, come back
soon and all. We have not gone out in the night much. When someone gets delayed, we get worried as to whether some problem has come up."" Another
migrant worker told us ""our friends have told that they have been asked for the identity card. Sometimes, if they are not able to produce the card, they are then
sent back. But we want to stay here for the money. We stay here but are a bit afraid.""



&gt; Unlike in the case with Punjab state where a migrant welfare board was constituted, Kerala has not constituted any separate welfare board for migrant workers. Instead, the welfare scheme for migrant workers is implemented by an existing welfare board for construction workers. In such a situation, issues of migrant workers such as their rights to public distribution system, membership in community health insurance scheme, **conflicts between local people and migrants do not receive attention**.

&gt; In the aftermath of the police action in the Jisha rape and murder case, the Kerala government is under pressure to enforce action to deal with the rising migrant population in the state. The government is mainly concerned with keeping track of the migrant population in the absence of an identification database, which would have violated the constitutional provisions of the right to work. However, even though the government plans to do this by launching an insurance scheme to incentivize migrants to voluntarily register themselves under the voluntary registration system, the **genesis of the measure can be traced to the controversial proposals of profiling migrant workers by blaming them for the law and order situation in the state**. Profiling by the state, even under the garb of welfare schemes, will further justify the existing middle-class ire against domestic and regional migrant labour, while giving a convenient cover for locals to feel guilt-free about rights violations in their state.

&gt; With the rape and murder of a Dalit law student, Jisha, in Kerala triggering a series of protests on the gross violations of women’s rights in the state and becoming a massive issue during the recent assembly elections, the major brunt has been borne by the migrant population in Kerala. This only intensified further with the arrested suspect turning out to be a migrant worker. The place at which the murder took place was only a few kilometers from the town of Perumbavoor or the ‘mini-North India’, which houses the majority of migrant population in the state. Even prior to this incident, **migrants across the state have been targeted heavily by the local population for crimes as petty as theft and on grounds of mere suspicion**.

&gt; In the last five years, **migrants have been increasingly blamed for the rising crime rates** – 1770 cases naming migrants as the accused – and the import of insurgents from India’s border states.

&gt; The **state is almost always complicit in the mainstream social thinking**. The migrants are paid lower wages than the locals working in the same job and they have been subjected to routine checks by the state’s health department which they perceive as discriminatory rather than welfare-oriented.[5]

&gt; The government is currently looking for ways to keep a track of the migrant workers entering the state, without violating the Constitution by forcefully registering them. This was spelled out clearly by Kerala’s labour minister, TP Ramakrishnan, recently, when he said that the government will kick-start a process of registration of migrant workers under the Kerala Migrant Workers Welfare Scheme, 2010




&gt; The way to go about it is complicated and the government is planning a system of incentives, like an insurance scheme, where the migrant workers would be motivated to register themselves voluntarily. The minister clearly said that the purpose for these incentives would be assist in creating a databank of migrant workers, as mandatory registration prior to employment was not an option. It is only to ensure that this step would not be seen as a headcount or a census that the government has proposed the measure of a voluntary insurance scheme. For, the existing legal framework has no way of ensuring that a systematic registration of migrants could be done. The existing Inter-state Migrant Act is seen as toothless, since it puts the onus of registering the labour on the contractors, and many migrants, today, are also coming in independent of the contractors.

&gt; However, the pertinent point is that a system of inclusive incentives will not work in the favour of improving local attitudes towards the migrants, if the **political culture of discrimination continues to prevail, as is happening** now. Since the discrimination already exists, these measures will only exacerbate the **constant vilification of the outsider** and will keep giving the majority local populations righteous reassurance, often becoming a **garb for masking the crimes that are committed by the locals**, since the policy uses paternalistic beneficence to generalize a **trend against the migrant populations**.
























&gt; The **political institutions in Kerala have not treated migrants on an equal footing** and the latest policy proposal by the labour minister – which underscores a rationale of profiling – is not the only reflection of that. According to reports, the police in Ernakulam district, home to almost 80% of the migrant population in the state, are collecting thumb impressions as a security measure, with all police stations in the district directed to maintain a registry to record the profiles of migrant labours coming for employment. Apart from thumb impressions, the migrants’ labour profile will also include name and address of the labourer, a copy of identification documents like voters ID or Aadhar, details of employer, contact number and photo. Such police actions have taken place in other districts of Kochi as well, and raised concerns of serious human rights violations in Thiruvananthapuram.

&gt; Moreover, historically, such actions have always been undertaken through the medium of data-collection for various welfare schemes. Besides the Migrant Labour Act, 1979, several such schemes were launched by the government, for providing night shelters, basic amenities, basic hygiene, medical care, fatal accident care, etc. to the migrant workers. While these schemes are well-meaning, in order to fulfill the welfare provisions under them, the police can be legally empowered to undertake the necessary profiling actions.

&gt; In fact this attempt by the government to registering migrants for delivering welfare schemes to them is a classic case of welfare schemes launched by government failing to realize their stated objective of inclusion and achieving the unstated objectives by intrusive profiling by the local bodies, rooted in the **everyday discriminatory social attitudes88.

&gt; And now, with the intent behind the recent policy announcement by the Kerala minister centering on ‘keeping track’ of migrants, the extent to which inclusive welfare schemes will work becomes questionable.


&gt; The immediate implications of the government’s policy proposal would be two-fold:

&gt; First, the induction of migrants into special or general workers’ schemes will have to be preceded by the necessary preparation of a database on them –as is the actual intent of the government. Such an activity is questionable, since all migrants are Indian citizens with the right to work and freedom of movement in any part of the country. The Kerala government cannot violate these rights. The only way to do so would be by empowering the local bodies to collect data by launching social welfare schemes. This raises the pertinent question of whether the **profiling becomes the real motive in the garb of inclusive welfare**; for, the real intent behind the launch of welfare schemes becomes clear by the fact that the proposal has been spelled out in response to the escalating migrant crisis.

&gt; Second, it is not sufficient to launch housing schemes for migrants without spelling out the detailed infrastructure that will ensure that the migrant workers are not further ghettoized, such as spelling out whether the government will reduce the presence of exploitative contractors and middle-men that prevent the integration of migrants in the society and lead to overall corruption. This is in context of the fact that the government is planning to launch the Labour department’s Bhavanam Foundation Kerala, the housing scheme for migrant labourers, known as “Apna Ghar”, in Palakkad at Rs. 8 crore, and also in Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam and Kozzzhzikode. These schemes will undoubtedly help in accommodating the migrant workers within the system as well in curbing the crime rates among the migrant workers; for, several investigations by police teams across Kerala have led to the observation that migrant workers living in illegal spaces lent out by the contractors –mostly in the plywood industry – and segregated from the society have led to a hike in crime rates. 


&gt; However, the challenge lies not only in creating better infrastructure for them, but in recognizing that migrant workers have no real vested interest in the external state and can, therefore, afford to ignore the way the locals would perceive crimes. Unless such real interest is created through conditions of actual inclusion, mere physical infrastructure and schemes would continue to become victims of **rampant corruption and anti-migrant political culture in the state**.

1044,"#PART 1

&gt; According to a study conducted by the Gulati Institute of Finance and Taxation (GIFT), three years ago, there are 25 lakh migrant labourers working in the state.
In a sense, they are a support system to Kerala’s economy.

&gt; However, in light of the recent Jisha Murder Case and other crimes being attributed to these labourers, there seems to be a **deep mistrust of them in the psyche of the public.**

&gt; Retd. Justice K. Chandru of the Madras High Court is an expert in labour law. He says, **“Whenever a crime is committed, in which a migrant worker is suspected, it is the attitude of the people against migrant workers that matters. People have a tendency to take the law into their hands and brutally attack the migrant worker. Even the State/Police excesses are condoned.”**

&gt; #This fear within people has naturally translated into calls for the profiling of migrant labourers.

[Source: Kochi Post](http://www.kochipost.com/2016/06/30/kerala-government-database-welfare-measure-or-surveillance-attempt/)

&gt; Malayalis have always roamed far from home, and adapted to alien cultures and com munities with ease, casting aside the mundu for Bermuda shorts, choosing pizza over puttu. But in the state itself, they seem less than welcoming to newcomers. 

&gt; Kerala's entrepreneurial backbone, its service economy , is now largely powered by migrants because the literate Malayali does not want to do jobs that are ""beneath"" his or her dignity. They refuse to do these jobs at home, while willing to do them abroad.

&gt; Migrants in Kerala, though, are **still seen as outsiders and interlopers who are ""ruining"" God's Own Country**. The recent arrest of Assamese migrant Ameerul Islam in the brutal Jisha murder case has become a tipping point in these anxieties. In its aftermath, there has been much debate in the state about whether the growing migrant population is straining Kerala's social fabric.

&gt; There is a steadily **rising public chorus that demands the profiling of migrants**. They ask that workers from outside Kerala be asked to register themselves at local police stations before taking up jobs.

&gt; Unlike other states where migrant labourers live in ghettos and slums, locals here accommodate migrants in their backyards because the state is landstarved. ""The entire area and the water bodies in them have turned filthy . There has been a spurt in crime in our once peaceful locality after the rise in its migrant population,"" says Suhas Menon, a Perumbavoor resident. 

[Source: TOI](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-06-26/news/74028684_1_migrants-assamese-malayalis)

&gt; Despite the critical role they play in Kerala’s labour scene, life is becoming **increasingly difficult for the migrant workers**. In what is clearly ironic about Malayalis, who are known for their migratory instincts with all its physical and emotional challenges, there is a tide of resentment building up against the migrant labourers. The migrant labourer is increasingly being viewed as the ‘other’ and, with the media ready to find a migrant labourer as the prime culprit in major and minor instances of crime, tension is building up in areas of migrant labour concentration. Not that there have not been isolated instances of migrant labourers being involved in criminal acts, but it is nowhere significant, nor does it display any pattern given the large number of migrants who live and work in Kerala. But the **clamour for virtual profiling of the migrant labourers is getting increasingly louder**.

&gt; An area of some genuine concern is the morbidity pattern among the migrant workers and the still to be validated fear that they could become carriers of infectious diseases. The health hazards posed by the pathetic hygienic conditions in which they live have evoked disgust and resentment among the local population. In 2013, this resentment took a violent turn at Paippad when disposal of night soil on a public road by the workers triggered a **violent reaction from the local community**. Inspections conducted by the health authorities in different parts of the State had revealed that condition of the sites where the migrant labourers lived was depressing. A second study conducted by GIFT, in association with the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM), has called for creation of a web-enabled comprehensive data base and tweaking of the present migrant worker registration mechanism to place emphasis on welfare **rather than profiling**..

Here's the local Shiv Sena unit head telling media they resented Nawazuddin's foray into the public staging of Ram Leela because of his [unsavoury character and bad reputation gained in the village community.](https://youtu.be/l3m-9VTpBDY?t=131) 

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

What's so wrong about Nawazuddin? Consider these:

Nawazuddin recalls when he was studying at NSD, Delhi all his batchmates had girlfriends except him. So he became friends with a girl. Once he took her to a park and **suddenly he grabbed her hand**:

&gt; नवाजुद्दीन यूपी के मुजफ्फरनगर जिले के बुढाना गांव से ताल्लुक रखते हैं।

&gt; नवाजुद्दीन ने पुराने इश्क का किस्सा सुनाते हुए बताया, ""तब मैं दिल्ली के एनएसडी में पढ़ाई कर रहा था। वहां सभी बैचमेट्स की गर्लफ्रेंड थीं सिवाए मेरे। मैंने भी एक लड़की से दोस्ती कर ली।""

&gt;""एक बार मैं उसके साथ पार्क घूमने गया था। वहां मैंने उसका हाथ पकड़ लिया। इस बात पर उसने मुझे डांट दिया। इस पर मेरी आंखों में आंसू आ गए।""

&gt; ""मुझे इमोशनल देख उसने कहा किसी को टच करने से पहले परमिशन लेना चाहिए। यह कहकर उसने मुझे गले से लगा लिया,"" नवाजुद्दीन ने हंसते हुए बताया।

&gt;  नवाजुद्दीन ने बताया कि उनके इसी रियल लाइफ वाकये को गैंग्स ऑफ वासेपुर-2 में फिलमाया गया।


That's not all. Before this, when he was a teenager in his village, he would follow a girl who would often go to the only house in the village that had a tv set, and once **ambushed her and grabbed her hand** and said 'what's there to watch in a tv, see me instead'!

&gt; **जबरन पकड़ा था पड़ोसन का हाथ**

&gt; टीनेज में उन्हें पड़ोस में रहनेवाली एक लड़की से इश्क हो गया था।

&gt; अपने फर्स्ट लव के बारे में नवाजुद्दीन ने बताया, ""मैं तब 17 साल का था। हमारे गांव में केवल एक घर में टीवी हुआ करता था। मेरे पड़ोस की लड़की टीवी देखने उस घर में जाया करती थी। मैं उस पर फिदा था, इसलिए उसका पीछा करने लगा। उसकी ही वजह से मैं भी टीवी देख लेता था।""

&gt; ""मैं उसका पीछा करता था। एक दिन हिम्मत करके मैंने उसका हाथ पकड़ लिया। मैंने कहा - टीवी में क्या रखा है, मुझे देखो। उसने गुस्से में हाथ झटकते हुए कहा - टीवी ज्यादा जरूरी है।""

&gt; ""मैंने उसे जवाब दिया कि एक दिन मैं भी टीवी पर आऊंगा, तब मुझे देखना। बस हमारी इतनी ही बात हुई और मेरे मन में कुछ करने का फितूर सवार हो गया।""

Nawazuddin has had to face allegations of **kicking his pregnant sister-in-law and harrassing her for dowry**:


&gt; फिल्म अभिनेता और बॉलीवुड के नए खलनायक नवाजुद्दीन सिद्दकी पर उनके छोटे भाई की पत्नी के आरोप लगाने का मामला सामने आया है। सिद्दकी पर दहेज के लिए मारपीट और कई गंभीर आरोप लगाए गए है।

&gt; दिल्ली के जाफराबाद निवासी युवती का निकाह अभिनेता नवाजुद्दीन सिद्दीकी के छोटे भाई मिनाजुद्दीन सिद्दीकी से 31 मई 2016 को हुआ था। आरोप है कि निकाह के बाद से ही पति व ससुराल वाले दहेज की मांग करते हुए उसे प्रताडि़त कर रहे हैं।

&gt; पीडि़ता ने पति पर नशे की गोलियां व इंजेक्शन लगाने का भी आरोप लगाया है। कोतवाली पुलिस द्वारा सुनवाई न करने पर वह शुक्रवार को माता-पिता व चाचा के साथ एसएसपी कार्यालय पहुंची थी। दूसरी ओर नवाजुद्दीन सिद्दीकी बुढ़ाना स्थित अपने घर पर मौजूद हैं।

&gt; परिजनों ने तेज बुखार से पीडि़त होने के कारण बातचीत कराने से इन्कार कर दिया है। इस मामले में परिवार का कोई भी सदस्य बोलने को तैयार नहीं है। दूसरी ओर, नवाजुद्दीन के पड़ोसियों ने दबे स्वर में मिनाजुद्दीन व उसकी पत्नी के बीच विवाद की बात कही।

&gt; बता दें कि आरोप है कि 28 सितंबर को नवाजुद्दीन सिद्दकी समेत महिला के पति व अन्य ससुराल वालों ने उससे मारपीट की। मायके से चाचा-चाची बुढ़ाना आए तो उन्हें भी पीटा। आरोप है कि नवाजुद्दीन सिद्दीकी ने तीन माह का गर्भ गिराने के उद्देश्य से उसके पेट में लात मारी।

1072,"&gt; What is the relevance? Such operations are in the domain of the military and the military has a good reputation at least at higher levels. If the DGMO himself held the press conference past precedent would suggest that he be taken seriously and accorded respect.

How is it not relevant? Only in a military-supremacist state will asking questions about the actions of the military be condemned. In a mature democracy, the people have the right to criticize the Courts and ask questions to their elected representatives about actions of the Forces. Nobody should be above scrutiny by the public in a democracy.

&gt; But it IS unprecedented as per former army officials and the previous DGMO from the UPA era.

If so, why is Parrikar not releasing footage that the Forces themselves have cleared for public perusal?

&gt; Is that all it comes down to? The dirtiest politics are justified when its against the BJP because at other times they do it? The more information and viewpoints that come out about these strikes,the uglier the surgical strike critics look to the public. Their reasons are as ugly as their actions.

Yes. The BJP has set new benchmarks in the politics of cunning. 'BJP is two-faced', 'BJP took U-turns', 'BJP cannot be trusted' - these narratives occur far too often across the nation, from Godse's family, to the agitators demanding Gorkhaland, the Bharatiya Bhasha Manch of Goa, and the laity of Kalyan-Dombivali that got taken by the false promise of Rs 6500 crore for their cities.  

Bharat built on a foundation of lies, half-truths and spin propaganda will never be strong and resilient as one built on time-tested and just principles that have seen us through times that wiped out other civilizations.

So now that the bad Brahmins are no longer in control of policies, the Indian government provides an extra helping hand to such discriminated communities. Of course, the Brahmins of today would like to claim government help too, but then since they have had centuries of privilege, they are not provided the same facilities. Once the Dalits reach the same level of progress as that of the Brahmins, then we might think of ushering in scriptural policies.

&gt; Rival parties and their supporters/internet warriors are tiptoeing around this because their main target is the BJP and Modi, but the fact is they are claiming/implying that the Indian army is spreading lies and propaganda on behalf of the BJP.

And India is not a military state as of now, right? Since the policy decision has to be made by the PM, it is only appropriate that the latter be petitioned for proof of said action sold as being 'unprecedented' by BJP spokespersons and many leaders.
 
&gt; I have seen that since political rivalry and spite is the main reason behind such sentiments they will not (publicly) relent, but right now these opposition voices, and not Modi or BJP, are the ones looking like 'jumlawadis' to the Indian public. Enjoy.

The blame for spite lies also with Modi and BJP for their past actions.

1087,"&gt; This is circular. You are using the word Brahmin/unBrahmin in the definition of a Brahmin/unBrahmin. I gave you scriptural definition based on gunas as to who is a Brahmin, which is not circular.

What made you think I was trying to define 'Brahmin'/'unBrahmin'? Did you fail to notice what part of your comment I quoted? 

&gt; &gt; others have to do it ie., treat you like an untouchable. Then you can call yourself a Dalit.

&gt; Many colleges refused to touch my application because I supposedly belonged to a ""forward caste"". So, can I call myself a Dalit now?

Did they make you hang a pot around your neck so you don't spit on the ground and/or tie a broom around your waist that brushes the ground as you walk so that you leave no footprints in the dust, lest your 'impure' existence soil that of those non-""forward castes"" who have gotten admission in that college? Did they make you walk only when the sun is directly overhead so that your 'dirty' shadow does not accidentally fall on someone of those non-""forward castes"" who have gotten admission in that college?

Brahmins arranged for the knowledge in the scriptures to remain locked up, by denying literacy to the masses, lest their 'Brahmin' status by birth be threatened and thus arrogated positions of social power for centuries. Hence, in India today, you will remain a Brahmin no matter what you do because the Brahmins of yore themselves devalued the scriptures to perpetuate their hegemony.

&gt; Translation:

&gt; Similarly, in light of the fact that **there are fears of HIV transmission in the minds of people of the LGBT community**, the Health Minister said that the government will make available psychological counseling facilities for them in collaboration with NGOs.

&gt; Seems to be a set up by BJP to trap the Shiv Sena Health Minister in a manufactured 'controversy', since it was BJP men who raised the issue of LGBT out of new-found concern for them.

The Regional Remote Sensing Centre of ISRO, Jodhpur worked on it:

&gt;  Dr JR Sharma who heads the Remote Sensing Services Centre in Jodhpur which is mapping the images, believes a major earthquake may have played a part in the demise of the Saraswati. There was, he says, a big tectonic activity that stopped the water supply to the river.

&gt; Sharma and his team believe they have found the Saraswati and are excited about what this discovery could mean for India. The idea is to tap its potential as a water source. They are working with India¿s leading water experts who are using the satellite images as clues.

&gt; Scientists hope to find water under the desert
Deep in the western Rajasthan desert, not far from the security-conscious border with Pakistan, an extraordinary programme is underway. Giant drilling rigs probe deep into the dry, arid earth pulling out undisturbed layers of soil and sediment for scientists to study and test.

[Source: India's 'miracle river'](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2073159.stm)

What they found:

&gt; A study has been carried out jointly by the Scientists of Regional Remote Sensing Service Centre, Indian Space Research Organisation, Jodhpur and Ground Water Department, Government of Rajasthan, Jodhpur. The results of the study have been presented in the article titled “New Findings of the Course of River Sarasvati,”, published in the Journal of Indian Society of Remote Sensing. The authors have concluded as under.

&gt; “Clear signatures of palaeo channels on the satellite imagery in the form of a strong and powerful continuous drainage system in the NW region and occurrence of archaeological sites of Pre-Harappan, Harappan and Post Harappan age, beyond doubt indicate the existence of a mighty palaeo drainage system of Vedic Sarasvati river in this region. As observed from satellite imagery river Sarasvati flowed eastward more or less parallel to the river Indus and shifted its course within a much narrower zone of less than 40 km.

&gt; The major (western most) channel of river Sarasvati remained more or less constant and unchanged and is considered to be the actual Rig Vedic Sarasvati river. The description and magnanimity of these channels also matches with the River Sarasvati described in the Vedic literature. From the prominence and width of the palaeo channels on the satellite data, supported with data from archaeological finds, age and quality of ground water, sediment type, etc., it is confirmed that river Sarasvati had its major course through present day river Ghaggar and further passing through parts of Jaisalmer and adjoining region in Pakistan and finally discharging into the Rann of Kachchh. A major palaeo channel of the river passes through Jaisalmer district while a considerable part of the river drained further, inside Pakistan.” 

&gt; This information was given by the Minister of State for Water Resources, Shri Vincent H. Pala in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha today. 

[Source: Detection of underground water, Rajya Sabha](http://www.pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=55044)

Now this is where it gets interesting:

&gt; The Palaeo-Ghaggar must have been a mighty river with broad channels once flowing through the Thar region, when the climate favoured abundant monsoon precipitation in the Sub-Himalayan region. Presently, the River Ghaggar is too small to have contributed significantly to the Thar sediments. The suggestion of glacial sources and the Yamuna and Satluj rivers draining to the River Saraswati through Ghaggar before they were pirated by the Ganga and Indus respectively are not supported by our isotopic data.

&gt; Our isotope data provide a scientific basis for the absence of a glacial-fed, perennial Himalayan river in the Harappan domain, i.e. the River Ghaggar is not the Saraswati as far as its origin in the glaciated Himalayas is concerned. Alternatively, River Saraswati had its origin in the Sub-Himalayas.

[Source: Is River Ghaggar, Saraswati? Geochemical constraints](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:HTT1YqKctKoJ:www.iisc.ernet.in/currsci/oct252004/1141.pdf+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=in&amp;client=firefox-a)

&gt; Ample evidence exists from ancient Indian texts, geomorphology and sedimentology that a mighty river that once originated in the Himalayas flowed in the North-west India during 7000-3000 BP and disappeared in the sands of the Rajasthan desert. Remote sensing combined with ground search identified part of the buried channel of the ancient river in the Jaisalmer region of Rajasthan. Isotope study showed that the fresh groundwater in that region was indeed ancient and slowly moving southwest and probably had headwater connection in the lower ranges of Himalayas, but not to any glacier. The isotope data (2H, 18O, 3H and 14C) compare well with the data in a similar study on another branch of the buried channel in the Cholistan part of the Thar Desert in Pakistan.

Findings emerging from related studies are beginning to challenge previously held notions:

&gt; A study of hundreds of ancient Indus Valley civilisation sites has revealed previously unsuspected patterns of growth and decline that challenge a long-standing idea of a solely eastward-moving wave of Indus urbanisation.

&gt; Researchers at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences (IMS), Chennai, combined data from archaeology, radiocarbon dating, and river flows to study how settlements around the Indus Valley region had evolved from around 7000 BC till 1000 BC.

&gt; Their analysis of 1,874 Indus region settlements has shown that the Indus urbanisation had three epicentres — Mehrgarh in present-day Baluchistan, Gujarat, and sites along an ancient river called the Ghaggar-Hakra in Haryana and Punjab.

&gt; The findings, published in Current Science, a journal of the Indian Academy of Sciences, dispute suggestions by international researchers that farming and urbanisation in the region was driven by a “wave of advance” moving eastward.

&gt; “We’re looking at large-scale patterns of how the Indus civilisation changed over time,” said Ronojoy Adhikari, a theoretical physicist at the IMS, who led a team that analysed geographic movements of Indus region settlements over hundreds of years.

&gt; “It’s like looking at something from a mountain-top — you get a different perspective than from examining archaeological sites,” Adhikari told The Telegraph. The analysis has also bolstered evidence for the idea that the civilisation did not abruptly collapse.

&gt; The 7000 BC site at Mehrgarh, Baluchistan, provides the earliest evidence for wheat and barley farming on the Indian subcontinent. But the new study and earlier archaeological data suggest that the Indus civilisation may have picked up rice cultivation from eastern India.

&gt; “This work provides new evidence to suggest that the Indus Valley civilisation had influences from the west and from the east — it was not a one-way west-to-east flow,” said Vasant Shinde, an archaeologist with Deccan College, Pune, who was not associated with the study.

&gt; Shinde said archaeological excavations had pointed to rice cultivation near present-day Gorakhpur in around 7000 BC — the same period as wheat and barley farming in Mehrgarh. Remains of burnt rice from sites in Haryana and Rajasthan, dated to between 4000 BC and 3500 BC, and signs of rice cultivation in the Indus Valley region around 2500 BC suggest an east-to-west flow of rice cultivation, Shinde said.

&gt; The analysis by Adhikari and his colleagues shows a dense distribution of Indus Valley sites around 2500 BC which marks the beginning of the mature period of the civilisation — lasting about 600 years until about 1900 BC.

&gt; The researchers believe it is during this period of high stability that the civilisation’s culture matured, leading to its script, the design of seals, and weights and measures. Adhikari said it was still unclear what kind of political organisation contributed to this uniformity in culture.

&gt; The study shows a “catastrophic reduction” in the number of sites in the Ghaggar-Hakra region around 1900 BC. Over time, the Indus sites moved upstream, but they were smaller in size and appear to show a breakdown in large urbanisation. But the decline around Mehrgarh and Gujarat occurred at a much slower pace.

Pursuing the project has the potential to solve one of the most pressing problems facing the region:

&gt;  Sharma and his team believe they have found the Saraswati and are excited about what this discovery could mean for India. The idea is to tap its potential as a water source. They are working with India's leading water experts who are using the satellite images as clues.

&gt; Water engineers are exploring the region's ancient riverbeds for what they call groundwater - underground reservoirs that contain perfectly drinkable water. If they are successful, their discovery could transform the lives of thousands of locals who currently experience harsh water shortages.

**PART 1**

While political sensitivities have constrained any 'mainstream' scientific scrutiny of the Rig Vedic Saraswati river, work done by other historians corroborated by unrefutable techniques like analysis of remote sensing data has put the spotlight on the issue again.

Very early work was actually done by the British:

&gt; But explorations of the region by British topographers, surveyors and geologists began in the 1820s, as I have documented in my book. They soon noted a wide, but dry, riverbed running more or less parallel to the Indus through a mostly arid region. It was called the “Ghaggar” and “Hakra” further downstream. They recorded numerous ruined mounds along its banks, local traditions of a “lost river of the Great Indian Desert” — a loss that explained the desolation of the region — and finally the presence of freshwater wells along that bed. Other explorations followed, building up a considerable body of evidence by the end of the 19th century.

[Source: Sarasvati: Tracing the death of a river](http://www.dnaindia.com/india/interview-sarasvati-tracing-the-death-of-a-river-1395200)

&gt;  The modern search for the Saraswati was first sparked by an English engineer called CF Oldham in 1893 when he was riding his horse along the dry bed of a seasonal Rajasthani river called the Ghaggar.

&gt; As he rode on, he was struck by a sudden thought. The Ghaggar when it flowed, was a small, puny river and there was no reason for its bed to be up to 3km wide in places unless it occupied the former course of a much larger river - the Saraswati.

&gt; The discovery of a vast prehistoric civilisation that lived along the banks of a major river, has added impetus to the growing modern belief that the Saraswati has been found.

&gt; Over 1000 archaeological sites have been found on the course of this river and they date from 3000 BC. One of these sites is the prehistoric town of Kalibangan in northern Rajasthan.

&gt; The town has proved a treasure trove of information about the Bronze Age people who actually lived on the banks of the Saraswati. Archaeologists have discovered that there were priests, farmers, merchants and very advanced artists and craftsmen living there.

&gt; Highly sophisticated seals on which there is evidence of writing have also been found, indicating that these people were literate, but unfortunately the seals have never been deciphered.

&gt; When F. Eden Pargiter of the ICS compiled the king-lists of the Puranas (Oxford University Press, 1922) and traced the list of kings back to 120 generations before the rule of Chandragupta Maurya, he noticed that Madhyadesh, the area west of the kingdom of Ayodhya, up till the river Sarasvati in the north-west was ruled by Yayati, the great grandson of the great Pururava who had founded the Lunar dynasty, the Chandravansha. The Bhargav rishi Ushanas-Shukra, the one who supported the asuras, was said to have his ashram on the banks of the Sarasvati.

Some of the earliest work on the project after Independence was done by [Padmashree Dr V. S. Wakankar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V._S._Wakankar), along with Akhil Bharatiya Itihas Sankalan Yojana established by [Moropant Pingle of the RSS.](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/RSS-man-will-head-historical-research-body/articleshow/37673645.cms) Padmashree Dr V. S. Wakankar is also known for discovering the Bhimbetka rock caves in 1957, had done extensive studies on coins and was considered an expert in ancient Indian history.

The Saraswati is popularly believed to be one of the three rivers that confluence at Prayag, the other two being Ganga and Yamuna:

&gt; For long historians had wondered about the mighty river Sarasvati that had been mentioned in the Rig Veda and the Mahabharata. Ambitambe, Naditambe, Devitambe, Sarasvati [the best of mothers, the best of rivers, the best of goddesses, Sarasvati], this is how it was venerated. But where did it exist? One bit of contemporary mythology held that it was the river, which made a tri-junction at Tirtharaj Prayag, contemporary Allahabad with the Ganga and the Yamuna.

[Source: And quiet flows the Sarasvati.....](http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20030218/cth1.htm)

OTOH there are speculations that the present-day Ghaggar and Hakra, are what remain of the Saraswati:

&gt; Oldham, a geologist of Geological Survey of India, was one of the first to offer as early as 1886, geological comments about Saraswati. According to him, the present dry-bed of Ghaggar River represents Saraswati’s former course and that its disappearance was precipitated when its waters were captured by Sutlej and Yamuna. This view differed from that of several others who felt that Saraswati vanished due to lack of rainfall. However, later-day meteorological research about palaeoclimates, oxygen isotopic studies, thermouminescenct (TL) dating of wind-borne and river-borne sands in the Thar desert region, radiocarbon dating of lake-bed deposits and archaeological evidences have all indicated that during early to middle Pleistocene period this region had enjoyed wetter climate, heavy rainfall and even recurring floods and that increase in aridity commenced by mid-Holocene (5000–3000 BC) only.

&gt; According to geological and glaciological studies, Saraswati was supposed to have originated in Bandapunch masiff (Sarawati-Rupin glacier confluence at Naitwar in western Garhwal). Descending through Adibadri, Bhavanipur and Balchapur in the foothills to the plains, the river took roughly a southwesterly course, passing through the plains of Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat and finally it is believed to have debouched into the ancient Arabian Sea at the Great Rann of Kutch. In this long journey, Saraswati was believed to have had three tributaries, Shatadru (Sutlej) arising from Mount Kailas, Drishadvati from Siwalik Hills and the old Yamuna. Together, they flowed along a channel, presently identified as that of the Ghaggar river, also called Hakra River in Rajasthan and Nara in Sindh. The rivers, Saraswati and Ghaggar, are therefore supposed to be one and the same, though a few workers use the name Ghaggar to describe Saraswati’s upper course and Hakra to its lower course, while some others refer Saraswati of weak and declining stage, by the name Ghaggar.

&gt; As historians of assorted hues tracked down its presence in ancient literature the riddle of the river became increasingly confounding. The river Sarasvati was said to be the mightiest of the mighty rivers. As broad as 10 km in some places, this river was the centre of civilisation and life-giver. Could the Ghaggar be this river at all? The mightiest that it did was to wash away a little mud from some spur on its banks or flood a few villages for a little while, and that too only after the heaviest of the monsoons. For most part of the year it remained a small rivulet, drying up even before summer had peaked. But as another Britisher, Oldham had discovered in the late 19th century, the Ghaggar flowed over a riverbed that was far larger than what the Ghaggar could occupy. Perhaps the larger bed was that of the Sarasvati?

*I am transcendental to the perishable world of matter, and even to the imperishable soul; hence I am celebrated, both in the Vedas and the Smṛitis, as the Supreme Divine Personality.*

*In this world, those that desire material success worship the demigods, since in human society success from such activities is quick to manifest.*

So, Hinduism allows a duality of believing in a singular Formless Supreme Being, as well as numerous demi gods to be worshipped in material form for different reasons.

1224,"&gt; You can buy land in Uttarakhand. If you are not a resident of the state, you are allowed to buy up to 300 sq. yards for residential purposes. The limit was imposed to counter the land mafia which came in when Uttarakhand became a new state.

The nation's most powerful and infamous land mafia exists in Maharashtra, and engages in demographic profiling on the basis of perceived dietary preferences to the detriment of Marathis that are being relegated to the fringes of the capital city. Should Maharashtra ban non-Maharashtrians from buying flats in the state? Bet the likes of you will erupt in howls of protest screaming bloody murder.


There was something else that led to this protectionism when Uttarakhand became a new state:

&gt; The Uttarakhand Kranti Dal had focussed on the location of the state’s capital as the main issue, which it said would shift to Gairsain, if elected. In its 36-point agenda, some issues were imposition of Article 371 to check the sale of the land to ‘outsiders’, rectification of shortcomings in the state’s formation, speedy division of assets with UP, 80 per cent reservation for locals in medical, engineering and other colleges of the state..

[Source](http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20020218/nation.htm)

It does appear that the people of that region are somewhat close-minded and resent 'outsiders':

&gt; Next door in Garwhal, the American anthropologist Gerald Berreman observed the villages as an ""unusually closed society whose members were accustomed to concealing and protecting themselves from the outside world."" This view easily applies to all paharis (hill people) and the ""winter line"" stretches to stand for more than just a climatic designation. It may also describe the perceived intrusiveness of dominating and often overbearing cultures from outside along with their accompanying social and economic challenges and environmental degradations. Recently, the entire area of Uttarkhand (which incorporates the districts of Pauri, Chamol, Tehri, Uttarkashi, Dehra-Dun, Garwhal, Almora, Pithogarh and Nainital) has become embroiled in the political dance of becoming a new state, which is bringing in the 21"" century with a vengeance. Even before all this transpired, Berreman felt paharis had little use for their kinsmen from the plains, and looked down upon them—a reciprocated practice from the plainsmen themselves.

Interestingly, as an aside, what's with the interplay between the paharis and those from the plains? Here:


&gt; Pahari Brahmins and Rajputs (the high castes of this area) customarily do many things that are unacceptable in high-caste plains circles. As a result they are denied the esteem of such people. The appellations ""Pahari Brahmin"" and ""Pahari Rajput"" are often used in derision by people of the plains. Among other unorthodox activities, these Paharis sacrifice animals, eat meat, drink liquor, are unfamiliar with the scriptures, largely ignore the great gods of Hinduism, consult diviners and shamans, fail to observe many of the ceremonies and ritual restrictions deemed necessary by high-caste plainsmen, take a bride price in marriage, marry widows, are not infrequently polygynous (and in some areas are polyandrous), occasionally marry across caste lines, share wives among brothers, ""sell"" women to men of dubious character from the plains. In order favorably to impress a plains Brahmin they must conceal these activities insofar as possible, and this they indeed do.

Because we were talking about whether there was any *growing* 'discrimination'. You *now* conceded there wasn't any discrimination. As for 'bigotry', it'd be incredibly naive to assume we were any less bigoted when we started off as a republic.

&gt; Maharashtra had many other industries and so maybe they were protecting their interests there rather than worrying about railway jobs. If people in every other state start being angry about every damn thing we are done as a country. What if Jharkhand and Orissa says that you need to have your headquarters in state instead of Mumbai for all the steel and automobile companies.

[You think that hasn't happened?](http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/shift-western-railway-headquarters-from-mumbai-to-ahmedabad/) Yet, Mumbai's attractiveness and unique nature makes it a natural magnet for companies and organizations. As a corollary, what if Maharashtra starts demanding companies HQ'ed in the state ought to have their factories within the state too?

&gt; What if they say you have to shoot so many movies in our state and they start taxing things manufactured in other states so that industry can grow and prosper in our state. Some states might benefit as end result but India is going to be worse off.

I'm sorry it appears that to you but you seem to be unwilling to appreciate how 'people in Delhi' practice institutionalized discrimination, that potentially threatens the unity of the nation in the first place, and concentrate on blaming the victims.

&gt; Communist leader Roza Deshpande gave me an example of how the Sena operated:

&gt; &gt; The Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilisers (RCF) unit at Chembur had invited applications for certain posts. If the officials scrutinising the applications, most of whom hailed from Uttar Pradesh, saw the applicant was a Maharashtrian, they would tear the form and throw it into the dustbin. The Sena got to know of this. Sainiks got hold of all the the forms thrown into the dustbins, took them to the officials concerned and demanded an explanation. When the officials groped for a reply, they were beaten up. The next day onwards, the tearing-up business stopped, and Marathi youths started getting jobs at RCF.

What makes you think there's been no hand wringing over the influence of Bollywood? State governments have tried to encourage Marathi films to counter the cannibalistic Hindi industry. It is the Hindis who have found Maharashtra to be the most hospitable - some time during the late 90s, a lot of the Hindi industry had started moving to Hyderabad around the time Ramoji studios came into prominence. Further back, during the 80s and 60s, a lot of Hindi films were made by southern studios. At the height of the anti-Hindi Daravida movement, Hindi movies were banned in Tamil Nadu which is when Balasaheb made it clear that southern-made Hindi movies wouldn't be allowed screenings in Mumbai. Karunanidhi arrived to meet Balasaheb and the ban on Hindi movies in Tamil Nadu was called off. Not many know they supported Hindi not only as an official language of the nation, but as a national language! Just that, this status shouldn't come at avoidable cost of other Indian languages.

1239,"&gt; Well those are exceptions not the norm. 

Wrong. In my five years of commenting on this sub, I have pointed out how there exist numerous measures across the nation that protect interests of local people, from Uttarakhand to Kerala. Heck, even the much-feted 'liberal' Delhi was toying with the idea of 'reserving' college seats for Delhi*wallahs*. Perfectly understandable if you genuinely appreciate the mind-boggling diversity and complex history of our country which is a nation of nations. Extrapolating standards developed and applied by relatively homogeneous or young or materialistic nations, to ours that is more varied and hoary, and probably values identity and culture more than others, would be erroneous. 







&gt; AFAIK there doesn't seem to be a law on the books or any bill in the pipeline that discriminates against Marathis in say UP, Delhi, Haryana, etc. 

Why quote only UP, Delhi and Haryana? Why exclude Uttarakhand and the North East? Are they not India? Did you read the boisterous feel-good comment above - *YOU ARE IN YOUR OWN COUNTRY. GO WHEREVER THE FUCK YOU WANT TO GO. THIS ISN'T FUCKING NORTH KOREA*? Doesn't it look utterly stupid now when you consider India is not what it makes out to be, that it is not factually correct but is just nationalistic jingoism? 

In the very province of the Marathis, exist provisions that [discriminate against the Marathis](http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-minority-status-in-flat-40-days-1986149) and place them at a disadvantage. How then, is India totally free? You talk about laws. Isn't it law to write the names of commercial establishments in the official language of the state *in addition* to English? Isn't it law that if you want to apply for a cabbie licence you should be able to understand the official language? Why then, did a free India create a ruckus when these laws were sought to be applied in the state where said language occupies it's deserved place? As an aside, it was in this very free India, that Kannada drivers in Dharwad protested Maharashtra Government's requirement of knowledge of Marathi for licence while their own state government mandates Kannada if you want to apply in their state capital! *This* is the true nature of the free people of free India. Let's face it, we are a terribly conceited people who have come to believe in survival of the fittest/might is right. Which is why we simply brazen it out. 











&gt; So you're supercool about those people migrating to Bombay, correct?

If they believe they have a moral responsibility of taking the trouble of walking the extra mile, trying to integrate with the people they want them to host, why not?

This submission is about a silent, growing movement of one of the biggest communities in one of India's largest states, that has largely steered clear of acquiring an overtly political face.

Triggered by the rape and murder of a Maratha girl in a small village. On the backdrop of unfulfilled demands for quotas for the marginalized among the community. Especially when a Brahmin CM (there's rivalry between Brahmins and Marathas in the state since long) has been foisted upon the state though much senior non-Brahmin leaders were in the fray, who later were pared down to size leading to simmering resentment. And an overtly Maratha, rural-based party that faces criminal action over irrigation scams is expected to make last ditch attempts to claw back into relevance. Because urban pan-Marathi (vs 'Maratha') parties like the Shiv Sena, led by Kayasthas, are keeping it from having a snatch at power.

Makes for an intriguing situation.

And you, sir, saunter in here, toss in a few generic nationalistic-minded admonitions - poor North Indian beaten, bad Marathi, MNS = Maratha etc, admit you know not much of Maratha, Marathi and Maharashtrian politics and yet, want your statements to be taken seriously?!

Indira even released a stamp in it's honor! To combat shortages in food-deficient states, the Centre introduced 'food zoning' because of which [Punjabi farmers probably received lesser prices](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=vnc6AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA174&amp;lpg=PA174&amp;dq=green+revolution+punjab+encourage+wheat&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hVdAjMAK5I&amp;sig=D5tlF3RZW6vfPZySq1XwNFVtXXY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZ_sDMiaHPAhWMKY8KHUmRBvM4FBDoAQgrMAU#v=onepage&amp;q=green%20revolution%20punjab%20encourage%20wheat&amp;f=false) for their wheat than they would have in the absence of such zoning.



Now that we are out of a ['ship-to-mouth existence'](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/the-wheat-mountains-of-the-punjab/article2006933.ece) and the Punjabi farmers have fallen into bad times, do we slam our very same *ann-daatas* as greedy? What sort of nationalism is this?!



_____________________________________________________________________________________________

&gt; #Why did User_name13 pick on Rajasthan in particular? Any good reasons? Punjab's rice and wheat is sold all over the country and a lot of it is even exported. Why this special love for Rajasthan?

Because:

&gt; Addressing a press conference of Saturday, Bains said in 1955, when Jawahar Lal Nehru was the Prime Minister, it was decided that the water of Ravi and Beas be given to Rajasthan even though both the rivers are not inter-state rivers and the water belonged to Punjab only. 


&gt; Further he said Rajasthan is non-riparian state and Punjab's water cannot be given to Rajasthan.


&gt; Further he said even after the water was given to Rajasthan, it was decided that Punjab can take allocation cost including cost of storage and others from Rajasthan, but Punjab failed to do the same for unknown reasons.


&gt; Further he said at the time when the Union government formed a committee for the distribution of water of Narmada river from Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh , the committee cancelled the application of Rajasthan stating it as non-riparian state. But the desert state is enjoying free water from Punjab without paying any cost especially when Punjab is providing huge power subsidy to its farmers to fetch ground water though tubewells.

Now that we are out of a ['ship-to-mouth existence'](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/the-wheat-mountains-of-the-punjab/article2006933.ece) and the Punjabi farmers have fallen into bad times, do we slam our very same *ann-daatas* as greedy? What sort of nationalism is this?!

&gt; Why did User_name13 pick on Rajasthan in particular? Any good reasons? Punjab's rice and wheat is sold all over the country and a lot of it is even exported. Why this special love for Rajasthan?

Because:

&gt; Addressing a press conference of Saturday, Bains said in 1955, when Jawahar Lal Nehru was the Prime Minister, it was decided that the water of Ravi and Beas be given to Rajasthan even though both the rivers are not inter-state rivers and the water belonged to Punjab only. 


&gt; Further he said Rajasthan is non-riparian state and Punjab's water cannot be given to Rajasthan.


&gt; Further he said even after the water was given to Rajasthan, it was decided that Punjab can take allocation cost including cost of storage and others from Rajasthan, but Punjab failed to do the same for unknown reasons.


&gt; Further he said at the time when the Union government formed a committee for the distribution of water of Narmada river from Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh , the committee cancelled the application of Rajasthan stating it as non-riparian state. But the desert state is enjoying free water from Punjab without paying any cost especially when Punjab is providing huge power subsidy to its farmers to fetch ground water though tubewells.

&gt; 2. He was elected to the state assembly for the first time in 2014. But, joined politics in 1997 and has served as the mayor in the Mira Bhayander Corporation. He was a district president of BJP until 2014.

&gt; 3. Mehta is the founder of the Seven Eleven Group of companies that has a 100-bed hospital, CBSE school besides mega affordable township project Apna Ghar to its credit. At the core the group gets its strength from real estate.

&gt; 4. Mehta is a Class 8 drop out and has declared assets worth Rs 18 crore in his election affidavit.

&gt; 5. He is not new to controversy. Recently, the civic body issued a show cause notice on his name for making illegal alterations in his school. Earlier, the legislator had also faced allegations of illegal hacking of mangroves for his construction projects but has denied the same.

&gt; 6. In December, 2002 Mehta was arrested by the Anti-Corruption Bureau,Thane for accepting a Rs 20,000 bribe from a local resident.The case is pending before the ACB court in Thane.

&gt; The Mira Bhayander Municipal Corporation (MBMC) mayor Narendra Mehta will have to deposit Rs 4.88 lakh into the civic kitty, which he had used to pay for police protection when the assembly election code of conduct was in force.

&gt; Mehta, who had stood as the BJP candidate from the 145 Mira-Bhayander assembly constituency was accused of violating the election code of conduct by the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS). According to Arun Kadam, MBMC's corporator from the MNS, Mehta had hastily deposited a cheque of Rs 4,88,286 lakh with the Mira Road police on September 22 towards protection for him between September 2007 and December 2008.


&gt; Kadam `alleged' that the money was taken from the civic funds and deposited with the police when the election code of conduct was in force. The MNS had also made a complaint with the election commission.


&gt; At the MBMC's general body meeting on Friday, there was an uproar over the expenditure. The police had written to the mayor on September 21 to deposit the amount which included an interest of Rs 50,650. The cheque was issued a day later even though the code of conduct was in force.


&gt; According to corporators, several letters from the police for protection money were ignored. The house decided that Mehta would return the money to the civic body. Mehta had lost to his nearest rival Gilbert Mendonca of the NCP.


&gt; Corporators `alleged' that despite contesting the elections, Mehta had also made use of the official residence and vehicle, which was again in violation of the election code of conduct.

&gt; Despite questions being raised on legality of their move, BJP leaders of Mira-Bhayander have defended the ban on sale of meat during Paryushan, citing the example of Mughal emperor Akbar. BJP legislator and corporator Narendra Mehta said, ""Even Emperor Akbar who had great respect for Jainism not only banned slaughtering animals during the fasting period but himself refrained from non-vegetarian food on certain days out of respect for his Hindu wife.""

I believe things would have been a lot different had Jainism and Buddhism not been 'contained'. A very good case in point, which I often quote, is the fate of Sindh under Raja Dahir, a ruler who was in awe of the pacifist principles of Jainism.

Pertinent to note that the non-violent, *sattvik* principles of Buddhism and Jainism appealed more to *savarnas* who traditionally had been prescribed such codes of conduct by Hindu scriptures.

Such tendencies are in a way appreciable in the contrast, in Maharashtra (which is quite unlike heavily *savarna* states like Uttarakhand or Gujarat, has good representation of Vaishnavas and Shaivas, and has 'Aryan' as well as 'Dravidian' strains among people), between the conduct of two conglomerations of Hindutva groups that differ substantially in *varna* breakdown of members and supporters.

Hinduism does not have non-violence as it's major and central philosophy unlike Buddhism and Jainism. In fact, Hinduism *rationalizes* the deployment of violence, which is also why we had the brouhaha over banning the Bhagvad Gita in Russia! In practice, Jains and Buddhists also do that. And at that point, there occurs a convergence with the more naturally evolved Hindu thought.

Relevant:

&gt; The Reorganisation Act, Section 78, provides for the apportioning of rights and liabilities of the existing State of Punjab among the successor States in relation to the Bhakhra-Nangal project and the Beas project, by agreement entered into by States after consultation with the Centre.

&gt; In April 1976, the Centre through a notification ruled that of available 15.2 million acre feet (MAF) of the water of the Sutlej, the Ravi and the Beas, Punjab and Haryana would be allocated 3.5 MAF each. Punjab filed a suit in the Supreme Court against the decision as well as challenged the validity of Section 78 of the Reorganisation Act.

&gt; In 1981, while the suit was still pending, the then Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi, convened a meeting of the Chief Ministers of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan, on December 31. They inked an agreement according to which the flow series were changed from 1921-45 to 1921-60, resulting in an increase of the available of the Ravi and Beas waters from 15.85 MAF to 17.17 MAF. Punjab withdrew its suit.

&gt; On April 8, 1982, Ms. Gandhi broke the ground near Kapuri village of Patiala district to mark the beginning of construction of the Sutlej-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal. On the same day the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) along with the State unit of the CPI(M) launched a Morcha against the canal. This metamorphosed into the ""Dharam Yudh Morcha"" of the SAD from the Akal Takhat in the Golden Temple complex in Amritsar. **The agitation assumed violent proportions and Punjab suffered terrorism for almost a decade.**

&gt; On July 24, 1985 the then Prime Ministers, Rajiv Gandhi, and the SAD chief, Sant Harchand Singh Longowal, signed the Punjab Accord, whose Clause(9) pertained to sharing of river waters.

&gt; It was decided to constitute a tribunal headed by a Supreme Court judge. The settlement also stipulated completion of SYL by August 15, 1986.

&gt; Later the SAD Ministry in Punjab, headed by the Chief Minister, S.S. Barnala, initiated the construction of SYL. More than Rs. 800 crores was said to have been spent on the project. **But not a brick has moved since 1992, when terrorists shot dead two top Engineers and nearly two dozen labourers working on the project.**

I'm not suggesting it as a solution at all, which you seemed to hint at. Because my comment could also have been taken to amount to something that was done to eliminate the practice of *Sati*. But to appreciate that, one will need to keep an open mind and have a minimum amount of respect for opponents who don't necessarily agree with them.

I repeat, vegetarian fundamentalists are a minority in Maharashtra yet they get appeased.


&gt; As for veggies in Maharashtra, they have find a way to live in pockets and exert influence there. I assumed you're taking about the Thane/Kalyan situation.

Yes, they have bought over the nationalism and Hindutvavaad of the old farts of Nagpur. Shri Raj Purohit of Kalbadevi revealed that in the now-famous video.



&gt; Demographic shifts, and ensuing socio-political shifts are a very real phenomenon, whether Jain or Muslim. You can't heart one and hate the other.

Again, people *can* change. 

We did not need to prohibit marriages to reduce the incidence of *Sati*. We don't need to cull radiologists to prevent the practice of female foeticide. We don't need to necessarily work against demographic shifts to prevent this practice of quasi-untouchability of the 21st century. ",2016-09-18 13:41:15+00:00,d7rqhx7,10.0,t1_d7rq6i0,636.0,india

1512,"&gt; They only do so where they have influence. If they are present in such numbers that they outnumber or out vote locals, clearly the demographic has changed.

Brings to mind the narrative often brought into discussions, how a particular community will 'remain quiet' when they're say &gt;10% of the population, will demand quotas when 30% and will start applying their laws to others once they cross 60%..

These veggie fundies are still minority in Maharashtra. It is the minority appeasement of the party that claims to stand for all Hindus, that has given rise to the situation.





&gt; Unless you want to prohibit migration within India. That's your only solution.

That's similar to saying the only solution to the problem of *Sati* lay in prohibition of marriages!

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; There is a reason why Gandhi belongs to India more than to Gujarat. He tried to stay above regional politics.


I was talking about the auto-urine drinker Nishan-e-Pakistan of India who got over a hundred pro-Maharashtrians murdered.

Agree. Shift Mantralaya and associated buildings to the 'mainland' and see how Mumbai transforms. But the 'vegetarian' lobby over the Hill will never let that happen.

&gt; King Bhimadev died in the year shaka 1225 (A.D. 1303) and was succeeded by his son Pratapbimba or Pratapdev. By some writers, it is believed, that, this Bimbadev or Bhima Raja was identical with one of the Gujarat Bhima Rajas of the Chalukya (Solanki) dynasty, who reigned at Anahilwada ; and Dr. DaCunha, (Origin of Bombay, p. 39), observes that the Bhima Raja of Gujarat, after his defeat by Mahomed of Guzni at Somanath, in the year 1024 A.D., ""fled from his country, and to make up for his loss in the north, marched  with his colony from Patan into the south, and settled at Mahim."" Now, we know it as a historical fact, that immediately after the departure of Mahomed and his army, Bhima Raja, again,, returned to his country of Anahilwada in Gujarat, caused the temple of Somanath to be built of stones in place of the former wooden one, which was destroyed by Mahomed ; that a few years later he sent an army against the Chief of Abu, whom he subdued; and that he reigned at Anahilwada till his death which happened in the year 1064 A. D.

&gt; The authors of Prabandha Chintamani and Dvydsraya (Jain Chronicles of Gujarat) have recorded, in some cases, even the most minute details of the reigns of the kings of the Chalukya dynasty of Anahilwada, and had the conquest and colonization of the Konkan or of Mahim by this Bhima Raja and his Gujarat people, actually taken place, they would not have omitted to chronicle so important an event. At the time of Mahomed's invasion, . the province of the Konkan was under the sway of the Silaharas, and from a copperplate grant dated shaka 948 (A. D. 1025) we find that.the king, Chittaraj, was the ruler of the 1,400 Konkan villages, the chief of which were Puri and Hanyaman, and, that the Taluka of Shashasthi (Salsette) formed a part of his possessions. There is no record of the province of the Konkan, being under the sovereignty of any one of the kings of the Solanki dynasty of Gujarat, and the only king of that house who successfully invaded the Konkan was Kumarpal, who through his General, Ambada, defeated Mallikarjun, the Silahara king of the Konkan, in A.D. 116o ; but even then, the province does not appear to have been annexed to the kingdom of Anahilwada, for we find that the Silaharas were the lords of the Konkan till the year 1260 A.D., when the last Silahara king, Someshwar, was defeated and slain by King Mahadev of Devagiri, and from that date, as has been stated before, the sovereignty of the Konkan passed from the bands of the Silaharas into those of the Yadavas of Devagiri, Bhima Raja (II), who reigned at Anahilwada from 11 79 to 1242 A.D., was so weak, that he was nicknamed Bhola^ or the simpleton, and the only thing the Gujsirat chroniclers record about him is, that, 'his kingdom was gradually divided among his powerful ministers and provincial chiefs."" It can, hardly, be expected, that so feeble a monarch,could have accomplished the conquest of the Konkan, which was, then, under the sway of the powerful Silahara kings, Aparaditya and his successor Keshidev. 

&gt; Thus, it will be clearly perceived that there is very little historical evidence to show, that Bhima Raja, who settled at Mahim, was, a king of the Solanki dynasty of Gujarat. On the other hand, it is an undisputed historical fact that, during the thirteenth century of the Christian era, and more especially, at its close, the whole of the Northern Konkan, was under the sovereignty of the Yadav Kings of Devagiri, and that the province was governed by Viceroys appointed from time to time, by Devagiri, kings. The last such Viceroy was Krishna, of the Bharadwaj gotra (A.D. 1290), and evidently, Bhima Raja, the second son of King Ramadev, took possession and ownership of his father's dominions in the Konkan, from this man, in or about the year 1294 A.D., when Alla-ud-din invaded Devagiri, and, defeated Ramadev and his son Shankardev. Among the Hindu princes, it was a custom, whenever a reigning king found that his life and kingdom were in danger, to send to a place of safety, a scion of the royal house in order that the royal vanshuy or line, may not become extinct. And, it appears, that, following this ancient usage. King Ramadev, when he found that, he and his son Shankar, who had come to his aid, were surrounded by the Mogal army and were in danger of losing their lives and kingdom, must have taken the precaution of sending his son Bhimadev to the Konkan which was up to that time, free from the attacks of the Moslem invaders. 

&gt; Mr. Murphy, in his "" Remarks on the Oldest Races of Bombay,"" observes that the great influx of a variety of castes and races into Bombay, may be traced to certain events, which render the political and commercial history of the island a living record; and that by studying their records, traditions, usages origin, and meaning of the names of the localities, and especially their language, one may fairly come to certain conclusions regarding the history of this island and its dependencies, particularly Salsette. Let us, therefore, see what historical evidence or inference we can gather from the language, traditions, usage and records of the communities or castes, that came to Bombay, and colonized the island. Four important communities or castes, viz. (i) the Pathar6 Prabhus and their priests, (2) the Palshikar Brahmans, (3) the Somavanshi-Kshatriyas or Panchakalshis, and (4) the Sheshavanshis or Bhandaris, are said to have come to Bombay with King Bhimadev, and these communities have played an important part in the early colonization and development of the island. The language spoken by these communities is Marathi, but the home language spoken by the Prabhus, Panchakalshis and Bhandaris, contains a large percentage of words borrowed from the aboriginal races of the island, the Kolis and Agris. The Palshikar Brahmans as religious guides and priests of these people, are socially and intellectually superior to them, and being in constant touch with religious Sanskrit literature, their home language does not contain so large a percentage of words, borrowed from the aboriginal races. Nevertheless, the language spoken by the oldest among their females, differs, widely, from the modern Marathi. In fact, it greatly resembles the language spoken in the Dekkati in the 13th century of the Christian era, and as such it would be a good test, for the purposes of investigation or research. Pick up from the Dnydneshwari or similar other Marathi work of the 13th century, five or ten words of pure Marathi origin, but, which appear to be obsolete or out of use&gt; and ask an uneducated old lady of this Brahman community, whether 
she understood any of them, and you will be surprised to find that the old lady not only understands many of these words, but, that she uses them, or at least used them years before, in her conversation, and that it was only the sneers of her educated daughter or daughter-in-law, that made her relinquish their use.



&gt; From the above, it will be perceived that the language spoken by the highest of the communities that accompanied King Bhimadev, does not, much differ from the language that was in vogue in the Dekkan, at the time of the migration of Bhimadev and his followers to the Konkan, and the reason for this is obvious. The successors of Bhimadev, did not reign long in Bombay, for, we find that in the middle of the 14th century, the Moslem rule was firmly established in the island, which remained under their sway, till the advent of the Portuguese. And, after this, the people remained under the rule of the Portuguese, and subsequently of the English. Thus, they were, in fact, shut up from all intercourse with their castemen in the Dekkan, and consequently, their language had no scope for improvement or development, and remained very much similar to what it was, at the time of their migration. 

&gt; The traditions of the Prabhus, Panchakalshis and their priests, the Palshikar Brahmans, are distinctly, in favour of the theory that they came from **Paithan** with King Bhimadev, the son of Ramadev, Raja of Devagiri, at the time when the town of Devagiri was invaded by AUa-ud-din, Emperor of Delhi ; and the old Maratha and Persian records, which are in the, possession of some of them, tend to support this view.

&gt; The identity of the Bhima Raja of Bombay is still in dispute. Dr. G. DaCunha and others hold that he was a Gujarat monarch, and in his ""Origin of Bombay,"" Dr. Cunha has tried to identify him with the Bhimadev of the Chalukya dynasty, who flourished at Anahilwada about the year 1024, and who, on his being defeated by the notorious Mahomed of QJiazni, fled to Baglan. But, this theory is not borne out by any authentic historical evidence ; and how the learned writer has failed in this attempt has been clearly shown at pages 15-18 of this treatise. On the other hand, the language, dress, names and localities of family deities, names and surnames, and traditions and records of the followers of the Bhima Raja of Bombay all tend to prove, that he and his followers, originally belonged to the Dekkan, and that they came to the North Konkan, by the way of Gujarat.

.


&gt; A. M. T. Jackson, Esq., M.A., I.C.S., has given special attention to the study of the available literature and traditions about Bhima Raja, and **his special proficiency in Sanskrit and Marathi** has afforded him great facilities in his investigations. A special interest, therefore, attaches to his opinion on this subject. In a letter dated London, 3rd July, 1901, Mr. Jackson says : ""Your information about Bhima Raja is interesting and valuable. The traditions of the Madhyandina Brahmans 
of Thana are all in favour of a **Deccan** home and confirm the connection of Bhima Raja with Mungi **Paithan**""

.

&gt; From a Persian firman issued by Nawab Chandakhan, Subha of the province of Damaun, and dated 901 A.H., i.e.y 1495 A.D., we learn that Bimbashah, hearing of the defeat of his father, Ramadev of Devagiri, by Alla-ud-din,fled with the Rajaguru Purushottam Punt Kavle, and eleven Umravs, by sea-shore, and, took possession of the fort of Parnera, and of Bardi, Sanjan, Damaun, Shirgaon, &amp; thus he got the territory from Parner to Astagar. He came to Mahi-Mahim (Bombay), and, divided the country into 12 parts, and, gave the province of Malad and some villages from the province of Pahad, to the Rajguru Kavle. In the Bimbakhyana it is stated that the king gave the village of Pahad to the Raja-purohit Kavle, and the village of Paspavli (Palsavli), to the Senadhipati and Kulguru Gangadharpant Nayak. This Nayak family appears to have been in high favour with the Devagiri kings, for we find (from Dr. Fleet's Kanarese Dynasties, p. 529) that in the year 1272 A.D. Mahapradhan Achyut Nayak was governing the province of Salsette as the Viceroy of Ramadev. 

&gt; From a Persian patent, bearing the seal of Mahomed Dalil, Dewan of Sultan Alla-ud-din of Bedar, and dated the first year of the accession to the throne, that is, about the year 1436 A.D., we find that, 'In the Shalvahan era 1212 (1290 A.D.) Raja Bimbashah having taken the ownership and possession of the country from the hands of Karsan, kept it for himself.


&gt; The country contains fourteen parganas from the jurisdiction of Saratbhate to the limit of Damaun. At the same time, the office of Sirdesai and Sirdeshpande, was under the controlling power of Govind Mitkari. The abovementioned Mitkari lived for three years in the reign of Raja Bimbashah."" ^ Now, we find from the early history of the Dekkan, that in the Shalivahan shaka 1212, a Brahman of the Bharadwaja gotra, named Krishna, was in charge of the North Konkan as the Viceroy of the Devagiri King Ramadev, and, therefore, it appears that ""Karsan"" from whom Raja Bimba took possession of the country of the Konkan, was identical with this Krishna. 

&gt; It is stated that when King Bimbadev or Bimbaraja came to the island of Mahim (Bombay), he found that the place was occupied, mostly, by the Kolis and other lower castes. It was full of babul trees, and the only places of interest were the ancient shrines Of Walukeshwar and Mumbadevi. The island was known by the name of Newale or Baradbet. The king changed its name to Mahim or Mahikavati, caused fruit trees, and particularly cocoanut trees, to be planted there, and, built several temples, the principal one being that built in honour of his family deity Prabhawati or Prabhadevi. He made Mahim, the capital of his kingdom, built there a palace for his own use, and several mansions for the accommodation of the Rajas and Chiefs, who came to the Konkan, either with him, or after him, through the fear of the Moslems. 

&gt; From a Danapatra or grant, of the rights of Sirdesai and Sirdeshpande, made, by King Bimbadev to his Raja-guru Purushottamrao Kavle, in the year shaka 1221 (A. D.I 299), we find, that the province of Konkan contained 14 parganas or districts, and 2 kashas or sub-divisions, and that the island of Mahim (Bombay), was a pargana containing seven hamlets. According to this grant, in the month of Magh, shaka 1220 (A.D. 1298) Maharajadhiraja Bimbashah purchased from Changunabai, widow of Govind Mitkari, the watan of Sirdesai and Sirdeshpande of the provinces of Malad, &amp;c., for 24,000 rayals, and after keeping it,' in his possession, for one year and three months, presented it, as a religious gift, to his spiritual guide, Purushottamrao Kavie of the Bharadwaja gotra, on the occasion of a solar eclipse, on the no-moon day of the month of Vaishakha in the shaka year 1221 (A. D. 1299), and in the presence of an assembly, consisting of Prime Minister Mahadevrao Shrinivas, Chitnavis Chandrabhan Parbhu, Patangrao Nyayadhish, other merchants, mahajans and jamindars.

&gt; The credit of foundation of Bombay goes to Raja Bhimdev, who belonged to Solanki alias Chalukya clan. He came from Gujarat region along with his followers and laid the foundation of city of Mahim then known as Mahikavati.

From [here:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Mumbai)

&gt; Although human habitation existed since the **Stone Age**, the **Kolis**, a Marathi fishing community,[1] were the earliest known settlers of the islands. The Maurya Empire gained control of the islands during the **3rd century BCE**, and transformed it into a centre of Hindu and Buddhist culture and religion. Later, between the **2nd century BCE and 9th century CE**, the islands came under the control of successive indigenous dynasties: Satavahanas, Abhiras, Vakatakas, Kalachuris, Konkan Mauryas, Chalukyas and Rashtrakutas, before being ruled by the Silharas from **810 to 1260.**




_________________________________________________________________________________________

&gt; From a Persian firman issued by Nawab Chand Khan, Subha of the province of Daman, and dated 901 A. H., that is A, D. 1495, we learn that Bimbashah, hearing of the defeat of his father Ramadev of Devagiri by AUa-ud-din, fled with the Rajguru Purushottam Pant Kavle and eleven Umraos by the shore of the sea, and took possession of the fort of Parnera, and of Bardi, Sanjan, Daman, Shirgaon and other places. He thus obtained all the territory from Parner to Astagar. He came unto Mahi (Mahim in Bombay), and divided the country into 12 parts, giving the province of Malad and some villages from the province of Pahad unto the Rajguru Kavle. The Bimbakhyan also records that the King gave the village of Pahad to the Raj-purohit Kavle, and the village of Paspavli to the Senadhipati and Kulguru Gangadhar Pant Nayak. 

&gt; Now, as Mr. Fleet's 'Kanarese Dynasties' proves, the Nayak family was in high favour with the Devgiri monarchy; for in A. D. 1272 Mahapradhan Achyut Nayak was Ramdev's viceroy in the province of Salsette. 

&gt; Secondly, there is in existence a Persian patent, bearing the seal of Mahomed Dalil, Dewan of Sultan Ala-ud-din of Bedar and dated the first year of the accession to the throne, that is about the year 1436 A. D., which shows that ^' in the Sativahan era 1212 (A. D. 1290) Raja Bimbashah, having taken the ownership and possession of the country from the hands of * Karson ', kept it for himself. The country contains fourteen Parganas from the jurisdiction of Saratbhata to the limits of Daman. At the same time, the office of Sirdesai and Sirdeshpande was under the control of Govind Mitkari. The said Mitkari lived for 3 years in the reign of Raja Bimbashah*"" 

&gt; From the early history of the Deccan, we already know that in the Shalivahan Shaka 1212, a Brahmin named Krishna of the Bharadvaja Gotra was the viceroy of King Ramdev in the North Konkan ; and we cannot help being convinced that the ""Karson"" of the Patent from whom Raja Bimb took possession, was identical with that Krishna. 

&gt; Lastly, a Danapatra, or grant of the rights of Sirdesai and Sirdeshpande, made by king Bimbdev to his Rajguru Purushottam Kavle in the year Shaka 1221 (A. D. 1299), shows that the province of the Konkan contained 14 Parganas or districts, and 2 Kasbas or sub-districts, and that the island of Mahim (Bombay) was called a Pargana containing 7 hamlets. It further states that *'In the month of Magh Shaka 1220 (A. D. 1298) Maharajadhiraja Bimbshah purchased from Changunabai, widow of Govind Mitkari, the watan of Sirdesai and Sirdeshpande in the provinces of Malad, etc., for 24,000 Rayals ; and after keeping it in his possession for one year* and three months, presented it as a religious offering to his spiritual guide Purushottam Kavle of the Bharadvaja Gotra, on the occasion of a Solar Eclipse in the dark half of the month Vaisakh in the Shaka year 1221 (A. D. 1299), and in the presence of an assembly consisting of the Prime Minister Madhavrao Shrinivas, Chitnavis Chandraban Parbhu, Patangrao Nyayadhishy and others, merchants, mahajans and jamindars.*""

&gt; ..The above evidence leads us to the conclusion that our king Bhimdev who died in the Shaka year 1225 (A. D. 1303) and was succeeded by his son Pratapabimba or Pratapshah, was none other than Bhima Raja the second son of king Ramdev of **Devagiri**.

&gt; Hitherto, most of the writers of the history of Bombay have confined their labours to describing the events that occurred from the date of the occupation and possession of this island, by the Portuguese and the British Governments. The history prior to these periods was considered a sealed letter. The reason for this is not far to seek. Most of these writers, being Europeans or foreigners, had no direct knowledge of, or access to, the rare and valuable materials and information that could be gathered from the descendants of the followers of Bhimadev or from other ancient families. But, when we find that even the story of the advent of Bhima Raja, was, in certain quarters, disbelieved or considered as a myth, we can easily account for the apathy shown by these writers, in this direction. 

&gt; Since the following sketch was written, some interesting and valuable information has come to hand from different sources regarding Bhima Raja and his successors^ the most important piece of information being the discovery of the site of the ancient city of Pratappur in the village of Parjapur near MaroL According to Marathi accounts and local traditions, it is believed that Pratapdev built a new city near Marol, in Salsette^ and called it Pratappur after his own name. Witlva view to obtaining some traces of this ancient city near Marol, Mr. S. M. Edwardes and the writer of this sketch went on the 29th of December, 1901, to Parjapur, and there, after a most careful and lengthy search, were discovered three images of Hindu goddesses (buried under ground)^ and traces of about six temples and an equal number of ponds* 
A full account of this has already appeared in the Times of India of the i6th of April, 1902.*

1643,"&gt; I dont compare Mrashtra to UP\Bihar. I compare it to South India, Gujarat and Delhi and it does fall short. Corruption in Mrashtra is endemic - be it the police or the state bureaucracy.

Again, this is a matter of perceptions where biases often come into play. And let's not talk of Delhi which has been adjudged as having the most corrupt municipal organizations.

&gt; Agreed. 26\7 was unusual. But please dont blame the bad traffic on geography. I explained in another thread how Mumbai's North South axis is more helpful than harmful.

Not blaming bad traffic, but a lot of things that are insurmountable, on geography and demography.

&gt; Keeping Mumbai in Maharshtra did undermine a lot of historical and cultural ties too. But then, might is right. And I think most Maharashtrians wont regret that even though that decision is the reason why Mumbai is still suffering.

Disagree on all counts. Mumbai squarely has always belonged to Maharashtra even since the times of Aungier. Settlers can change demographic makeup but not history of a place. And the starkest illustration of might can be seen in Ambedkar's writings on how Marathis and their regions always got a bad deal in the unified Bombay province, and also how an avowed vegetarian, *ahimsavaadi* and tyrannical Gandhian murdered over a hundred people his ilk evidently held in utter contempt. Mumbai's sufferings have several causative factors, everyone with an ax to grind takes those and blames them on people they have always loved to hate upon.",2016-09-11 10:27:27+00:00,d7i1gxr,13.0,t1_d7i0l17,3457.0,india

1650,"Almost none of the points you raised are exclusive to Maharashtra. The state's bureaucracy has been known as one of the better ones in the nation since long. Media reports paint a skewed picture because Maharashtra gets disproportionately more limelight than other parts. For example, on a past thread about a cop having slapped a rowdy drunk girl in Mumbai, I linked to several reports from across the nation where policemen had assaulted, maimed and raped citizens but there was barely any outrage as for the Mumbai incident. 

'Crass' is a matter of perspective. To elitists it might appear crass, I do agree.

The geographical factors are undeniably responsible for some of Mumbai's woes. Again, for example, there was admission from non-Indian authorities that even Manhattan would have drowned had it received the kind of rains Mumbai received that fateful year. Across the cities there may be cities in geographies worse than Mumbai, but they aren't subject to quintessentially Indian constraints.


Separating Mumbai from Maharashtra raised the specter of undermining the influence of historical and cultural ties. Which were a powerful motivating force as we fought for independence from a distant Imperialist ruler. And opposed the partition of the nation.

&gt; Why does BJP require the MLA's support in the first place? They have a massive lead in the Assembly. And a single MLA will not get them pass the halfway mark. So it's unlikely that the MLA had any sway over the police, as you're claiming it to be.

That's not how politics works. With each MLA comes his band of supporters that can be deployed during civic elections. BJP fought hard during the KDMC elections, the CM even promised a package of Rs 6,500 crore for the region which is still yet to be given and looks likely that it will never be granted as many of their promises elsewhere.

1689,"Okay, seems you're talking about visarjan at Girgaon Chowpatty. Not a reporter/pro photographer, but here are my suggestions.

There usually are quite a few photographers around, on the last day when Lalbaugcha Raja is seen off. I'd say, befriend one and tag along.

You could probably get to mount a watch tower manned by lifeguards, that gives a panoramic view of the entire Chowpatty. Lalbaugcha Raja takes the entire day to traverse the distance and reaches the shore at around 6.30 to 7 am. As the Raja is eased closer to the coastline, a veritable sea of humanity gathers around Him and sways with pushes and pulls that seem to emanate out of nowhere! Being in such a collective mass of human beings standing on their feet, that sways you almost rhythmically, is kinda freaky because you know there's nothing solid to hold on to, should there be a stampede! But, bappa protects.

Girgaoncha Raja is immersed a few hours before. Important: do NOT shoot Ganesha without the usual ornamentation; I've seen a naive guy getting a dressing down for snapping a pic of such an idol. One of the dudes from that mandal told me they discourage photography of unadorned idols for aesthetic reasons.

Carry your waterproof camera casings/bags. It always rains on that day. And trust me, the whole atmosphere turns electric, with the powerful percussion of dhol tasha and the youthful energy of the processions of various mandals. 

Every year, a lot of Nepalis turn up. They roam about in groups and break into impromptu folk dances. They kinda don't like when anyone else (read non-Nepalis) join in, I've seen them break up a performance when something like this happened. 

Then there are the LGBTs. Ganesh bhakts in their own way! They too sing and dance in formations, and Mumbaikars tend to give them their own space.

A lot of curious newly-arrived Northies turn up as well. You can sense Ganeshotsav on such a scale is a unique experience for them.

Food stalls on the Chowpatty serve till late night - Chinese, chaat, beverages, smokes etc. Charni Road station is at a very walkable distance (Mumbaikars' definition of 'walkable' sometimes ends up frustrating people from other cities used to personal conveyance for even short distances), check last local timings if you want to leave by 1am. Cabbies are around till early dawn and later but they often act smart because of the crowd. 

All said, visarjan at Girgaon Chowpatty is an amazing experience not only for the actual immersion, but also for the social show Ganpati bappa puts up for all of us. Enjoy it till it lasts for a few more years in it's present avatar because with the changing demographics and political character of the city, visarjan will become gentrified and sparse in the times to come. Already, the hypocritical restrictions on not just loudspeakers, but also percussion has kinda made it relatively a very tepid affair. With bans on dahi handi heights it's not inconceivable that visarjan will also be targeted especially if a certain pro-gentrification political party gains traction in city affairs. 

I've pulled memorable all-nighters there, and each one only makes me wait for the next year even more. Honestly, as I leave all I think is *pudhchya varshi lavkar ya*.",2016-09-09 08:12:36+00:00,d7feewy,1.0,t3_51w3ni,4721.0,mumbai

1724,"Lies, half-truths and obfuscations! What more could be expected of adulators of those who lied through his teeth to the topmost rungs of this nation, and later shamelessly admitted it right in our faces! 

It was not Shiv Sena, but [Gadbadkari's chums](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec7WHdZ3VwU) who [*displayed* meat](http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-meat-ban-protests-mns-attempts-to-cook-chicken-outside-jain-community-program-hall-in-thane-2124784) in front of Jain temples. In fact, Shiv Sena [sorted out the matter](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Meat-Ban-Thackeray-Jain-leaders-meet-close-the-row/articleshow/48944879.cms) quite amicably.

Pertinent to note that despite the fact that Balasaheb generally kept away from godmen, Jain spiritual leader Acharya Sagarchandra Jain Muni [came to Matoshree barefoot, walking from Mulund,](http://www.rediff.com/news/report/thackeray-recovering-no-need-to-worry-shiv-sena-mouthpiece/20121117.htm) about 35 km away when the former was ailing.

Now, the Shiv Sena had an understanding with the BJP since during the days when psecularists had a stranglehold on the nation and its systems - *deshaat BhaJaP, rajyaat Sena* (BJP for the nation, Sena for the state). Which is why, since the early 90s when the Sena was very popular in the northern parts of India, Sena leaders never visited shakhas despite repeated requests from Sainiks there, and thus the organization never grew. All this for *coalition dharma*. But now after the BJP's clear declaration of wiping out even allies from the political space (*shatpratishat BhaJaPa*), the Sena too has declared that it is planning to [go national](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/interview/the-shiv-sena-is-going-national-aaditya-thackeray/article6963530.ece). In fact, it took the Bihar Assembly elections very seriously and managed to damage prospects of the BJP by winning more votes in nearly [35 constituencies](http://www.mid-day.com/articles/after-bihar-win-shiv-sena-eyes-uttar-pradesh/16668187). One of the reasons for this could be the work of the Sena [amongst Biharis in Mumbai.](http://jpnhindinews.blogspot.com/2015/11/blog-post_27.html) Similarly, given their plans for nationwide expansion, it is only appropriate that Sena begin to work among the Gujaratis, especially since Gujarat is sitting on a powder keg right now and is to face assembly elections soon.

After all, if BJP can flirt with [proselytizing soul harversters](http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parrikar-cheated-hindus-says-former-goa-rss-chief/story-O9jiddCziMGdcwMuFkyiWL.html) or [praise them to the skies](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/feeling-proud-over-mother-teresas-canonisation-pm-modi-1451321) despite having baptised dying Hindus, or create hurdles in Amarnath yatra in conjunction with Afzal premis, or have Valentine's lunches with the very people they whined as being Naturally Corrupt, the Sena serenading Gujaratis or Biharis is perfectly okay.

1743,"Damage control by Brahmin-Bania complex. BJP badly needs to appear pro-Christian in Goa. Which is why it is brazenly favoring missionary-run English schools *despite promising justice to Marathi and Konkani*:


&gt; The genesis of the controversy goes back to 1991, when the government of the day decided to grant financial aid only to primary schools whose medium of instruction was either in regional languages like Konkani or Marathi, keeping English medium schools out of the state financial assistance list.


&gt; But a growing demand for education in the English language at primary level forced parents of students studying in Church-run schools, with subtle patronage from Church officials, to agitate in 2010 and demand grants for primary schools teaching in English medium too.


&gt; In the lead up to the 2012 state assembly elections, the **BJP promised to find a scientific solution to the vexing problem,**, while also supporting a campaign led by the Bharatiya Bhasha Suraksha Samiti (BBSM), a collective of Indian language supporters including academics, politicians and writers, **against allowing government grants to English medium** primary schools. Velingkar himself was at the forefront of the Samiti's activities.

&gt; After the BJP-led coalition government assumed power, then chief minister **Manohar Parrikar, via an ad hoc decision in 2012, decided to give grants to only existing minority educational institutions** that were using English as a medium of instruction, with new schools being denied the privilege.
While the RSS had criticised the decision at the time, its anger against what it called the BJP's ""shameful compromise"" is now reaching a crescendo, with assembly elections less than a year away.

[Source](http://www.firstpost.com/politics/rss-rises-as-ruling-bjps-bitter-critic-in-poll-bound-goa-2714308.html)


This is why Velingkar *publicly* opposed BJP and decided to 'teach them a lesson' by damaging their prospects at the ballot box. 


But this could also be an elaborate pre-scripted drama played out by the Brahmin-Bania complex to mop up votes on either side of the fence, because another party - the MGP is waiting in the wings to swoop down on the pro-Marathi/Konkani votes after being marginalized by their parasitic ally BJP.

1823,"If you think they're lying then just say so, instead of suggesting there's no point in delving into the past: *how far back in history do you want to go, and what will it do for the issues we are facing today.*

&gt; even if this were true, it is truth in the same way that 'germans voted for hitler' is true. it is true but what does it mean now? the congress is trying to imply that RSS and BJP are anti india even today. 

Well, if it's true then it could imply that the RSS and their ilk have been more concerned with self-preservation, quite unlike those who destroyed their own very existence for the sake of the motherland.

&gt; So it is the same as saying any useless fact, but with an intention to spark some issue.

It could also be said that a lot of facts BJP says are useless. But fact is, nothing is really absolutely useless.

&gt; If there is ONE thing that indians can change and it will have the most beneficial impact on our lives is to 'stop taking hints'. refuse to take the hint. make everyone spell out exactly what they want to say. a lot of people will stop talking.

Not like BJP doesn't 'drop' hints. The Paryushan meat ban was a good enough hint on part of the BJP. The Parivar has mastered the art of dog whistling which is very well exemplified by how their Lauh Purush leaders went around stating 6 December 1992 was the saddest day of their lives.

Not that I disagree, but could you please explain why not only English?

&gt; All IAS trainees who want to work for the Central Government should learn hindi. By the same token, any IAS officer who wants to be part of a particular state cadre should be forced to learn the state's language. For example, if an IAS or IPS officer from outside Maharashtra wants to be a collector or DSP in Mumbai, knowing Marathi should be mandatory for him. If the people of Maha have chosen Marathi as the government language, then every senior official in the Maha government should learn Marathi.

AFAIK officers often do that. The real contentious issue is of lay migrants. Should they respect local culture and learn language of the state to which they chose to migrate?

&gt; The cow vigilantes who tied four Dalits to an SUV and took turns at flogging them in Gujarat are petty thugs who enjoyed political protection and used bovine politics to maximise their returns from extortion and bootlegging rackets, enquiries by The Telegraph suggest.

&gt; The cow vigilantism arms them with the veneer of legitimacy and an image of selfless social activism which ensure that police do not touch them and their illicit activities, sources pointed out.

&gt; So far, the Prime Minister has not spoken out on the atrocity in spite of a video clip of the brutal beating being telecast repeatedly - in sharp contrast with the clear message Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee sent recently on upholding the right to choose what people want to eat.

&gt; The silence in New Delhi has emboldened the vigilantes who are seeking immunity behind a religious façade - an upright inspector was called ""anti-Hindu"" by the local tough who eventually led the assault on the Dailt youths in Gujarat. **The officer was later transferred.**

&gt; Pramod Goswami, a 26-year-old hailing from Samter village, 20km from Una, is accused of leading the gang. Till he was arrested, Pramod **gave the impression** that he was the district president of the Shiv Sena and the local chief of a cow protection committee.

&gt; Both the Sena and the cow protectors have **distanced themselves** from Pramod.

&gt; Sources said the **bootlegging racket is controlled by Pramod, an alleged protégé of a former BJP legislator Kalubhai Rathod** who now calls him a "" tapori (goon)"" and says that he has nothing to do with him.

&gt; A district functionary of the BJP said that not just Pramod, but **most of those arrested for thrashing the Dalits are associated with Rathod** who had been held earlier under the Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Act.

&gt; The former MLA controls the Una civic body - his wife Manjulaben is the president while he and his brother are councillors.

 &gt; ..""Pramod Goswami is not a gau rakshak. He runs a gang of 35 people. He heads an extortion racket and **has the backing of a former BJP MLA. He operates from the former MLA's office**.""

Predictably, an article that doesn't even touch upon the BJP connection has been submitted and unsurprisingly the Gujarat CID has found the main culprit is a sworn and vetted Shiv Sena worker. Pertinent to note, the Shiv Sena has declared it's intention of [going electorally national](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/interview/the-shiv-sena-is-going-national-aaditya-thackeray/article6963530.ece) (it has a presence in several states, but only as a socio-cultural organization), and after [their Bihar debut](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/bihar-elections-2015/news/Bihar-election-results-Shiv-Sena-beats-BJP-in-35-seats/articleshow/49730038.cms) is now preparing their [UP strategy](http://www.asianage.com/india/shiv-sena-contest-300-seats-uttar-pradesh-542). 

Even Congressis will quietly relish this BJP propaganda because, [2017](http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai/the-fight-is-between-the-congress-and-the-shiv-sena/story-qy15AFgpsXMLY2KfLUhCBO.html).


Truth is the fatality here.

/u/MeManoos, do read this comment I just posted.

Sanghi-types only organize prabhat pheris with lathis in strongholds; they have quivered in their shorts when faced with the might of state apparatus and/or public opinion. Whether it was in the aftermath of Gandhiji's assassination, the Emergency, after the demolition in Ayodhya when BJP vice president Sundar Singh Bhandari pointed fingers at Shiv Sena (BJP leaders went around saying how it was the saddest day of their life while, when told about Bhandari's statement, Thackeray said if what Bhandari said was right he'd be proud of his workers), or after the '93 riots of Bombay when BJP broke it's alliance with Shiv Sena following a barrage of criticism targeting the latter (despite that the Sena had stood by the BJP post-Ayodhya even in the face of worldwide condemnation of the Parivar), the Sangh's fronts have often wilted under pressure and they've jumped many hoops to get out of sticky situations.

I had [warned long ago](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2j6zzd/mumbaikars_please_vote_responsibly_tomorrow/cl9bh9y) that this vegetarian thing is going to blow up, and predictably, [BJP's indulgence](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/BJP-isolated-as-BMC-votes-to-stop-builders-who-prohibit-meat-eaters/articleshow/45301240.cms) has [emboldened](http://www.mumbaimirror.com/mumbai/cover-story/Veg-vs-Non-veg/articleshow/53549171.cms) these fundamentalist vegetarian/*sattvik*-types.

&gt; So far, the Prime Minister has not spoken out on the atrocity in spite of a video clip of the brutal beating being telecast repeatedly - in sharp contrast with the clear message Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee sent recently on upholding the right to choose what people want to eat.

&gt; The silence in New Delhi has emboldened the vigilantes who are seeking immunity behind a religious façade - an upright inspector was called ""anti-Hindu"" by the local tough who eventually led the assault on the Dailt youths in Gujarat. **The officer was later transferred.**

&gt; Pramod Goswami, a 26-year-old hailing from Samter village, 20km from Una, is accused of leading the gang. Till he was arrested, Pramod **gave the impression** that he was the district president of the Shiv Sena and the local chief of a cow protection committee.

&gt; Both the Sena and the cow protectors have **distanced themselves** from Pramod.

&gt; Sources said the **bootlegging racket is controlled by Pramod, an alleged protégé of a former BJP legislator Kalubhai Rathod** who now calls him a "" tapori (goon)"" and says that he has nothing to do with him.

&gt; A district functionary of the BJP said that not just Pramod, but **most of those arrested for thrashing the Dalits are associated with Rathod** who had been held earlier under the Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Act.

&gt; The former MLA controls the Una civic body - his wife Manjulaben is the president while he and his brother are councillors.

 &gt; ..""Pramod Goswami is not a gau rakshak. He runs a gang of 35 people. He heads an extortion racket and **has the backing of a former BJP MLA. He operates from the former MLA's office**.""

1960,"&gt; According to some academics, the name Gupta is derived from Sanskrit goptri, meaning **'protector' or 'governor'**.[1] According to prominent historian R. C. Majumdar, the surname Gupta was adopted by several different communities in northern and eastern India at different times.[2]

&gt; Unlike other Indian surnames, the surname Gupta has been adopted by various different communities across India irrespective of their caste.

&gt; In India, the surname Gupta is used mainly by the Vaishya Bania communities, particularly those belonging to Rauniyar, Agarwal, Mahur, Tailik(Teli), Barnwal, Kanu, Khandelwal, Arora,Jaiswal, Arya Vaishya, Mahajan, Mahawar, Maheshwari, Patwa, Kasuadhan, Lashkari and Mathur Vaishya sub castes.[3]

&gt; Additionally, the surname Gupta is adopted by some other communities in other parts of the Indian subcontinent:

&gt; - The Guptas from the West Bengal belong to the Vaidya/Baidya (physician) community, and are related to the Sengupta and Dasgupta communities of Bengal who are also Vaidyas.

&gt; - Kayasthas also use the title Guptha like Sen Gupta and Das Gupta

&gt; Sections of Pakistan media have been feasting on an invention. The Pak internet in particular has been rife with reports this past one week that Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray's granddaughter Neha has married a Gujarati Muslim. The reports spice up the suggestion of authenticity by adding that Bal Thackeray did not attend the wedding.

&gt; The groom, Mannan Thakkar, however is son of construction magnate Nipubhai Thakkar, who starts laughing at the thought. ""We have always been Hindu Gujaratis. I don't know why such reports are being published. Several veteran journalists from regional media houses attended the wedding. I don't know why it is being said that my son is a Muslim."" Thakkar says he is both amused and confused.

&gt; Mannan, a medical practitioner in Mumbai, married Neha, a jewellery designer, at a glittering ceremony on 4 December at the five-star Taj Land's End in the city. The wedding was attended by all members of the Thackeray clan, including Bal Thackeray.

&gt; Neha is the daughter of Bal Thackeray's son Bindumadhav (also known as Binda), a film producer who passed away in an accident in 1996. According to the late Binda Thackeray's friends, his wife Madhavi moved out of the Thackerays' Bandra residence Matoshree with her children Neha and Nihar soon after his death. The family is known to be close to Balasaheb's nephew, the rebel Raj Thackeray, who has formed his own party, the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena. The only time Nihar was spotted in public was at Raj Thackeray's home when the latter was arrested in February 2008 for his anti-migrant speech.

&gt; ""I have known Neha since her childhood. My elder son Mannan is a doctor who studied in the United States. My younger son Naman is studying to be a lawyer and will soon appear for his examinations. Naman too is getting married. His wedding is on 29 January 2012. He is marrying the daughter of Dipan Merchant, Chief Advisory Counsel of Adarsh Commission. He is working under him as a trainee,"" says the groom's father. Nipubhai Thakkar was a friend of Binda Thackeray.

&gt; A source who attended the wedding said, ""It was Rajsaheb (Raj Thackeray) who performed the kanyadaan. He was in charge of the entire marriage celebrations and was present at the venue early and stayed till the end. Balasaheb came with Uddhav and others in the evening.""

&gt; Maharashtra Navnirman Sena spokesperson Shirish Parkar, who attended the wedding, told The Sunday Guardian that the marriage ceremony was a close knit affair but the reception was attended by over 1,000 guests. ""The marriage took place according to Hindu rituals. A variety of cuisines from across the world were served at the reception,"" said Parkar. Almost all MNS MLAs attended the wedding.

&gt; 58-year-old Nipubhai Thakkar said that he did not feel like issuing any clarifications on the ""reports"" circulating on the internet. ""We are ordinary people. I thought such 'news' would circulate for two-three days and then stop. Since Balasahebji himself refrained from issuing any clarifications I too thought it was best not to say anything. Balasaheb is like my uncle and someone as prominent as him will always be in the news. Someone has played mischief and it is best to ignore it. If more clarifications on this matter are needed you are welcome to come to my home and meet my wife,"" he said.

2221,"#The issue:



&gt; Although, the state has been bifurcated and new state of Telangana created, the High Court has not been divided and continues to be one which means that judicial officers can be posted anywhere in AP or Telangana.

&gt; Telangana judges are saying that as the high court is yet to be divided, the HC should have informed the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) while allocating judges so that they could have been posted according to their nativity.





&gt; “HC should have communicated with DoPT and Union Law Minister on this issue instead of arbitrarily posting people from AP in Telangana judiciary,” one of the suspended judges said Tuesday.

&gt; In recent weeks, at least 900 judicial officers who were working in various courts in united AP were divided between the two states. In the first week of May one provisional list of allotment of judges to lower courts was issued. As per the list, 335 judicial officers were allotted to Telangana while 495 were allocated to AP. However, of the 335 judicial officers allocated to Telangana, at least 130 are natives of AP who opted to work in Telangana, according to the Telangana Judicial Officers Association. The Association points out that currently 234 district judges are serving in both the states and they needed to allocated according to 40:60 ratio.

&gt; “Accordingly, 94 judges should have been allocated to Telangana and 140 to AP. However, the HC allocated only 84 district judges to AP and left 46 vacancies while appointing 102 district judges instead of 94. Of the 102 district judges allocated to Telangana, 72 are from AP and only 30 are from Telangana. All this was influenced by judges in the HC,” one judicial officer said.

&gt; The protest against this provisional allocation soon turned to agitation for a separate high court for Telangana.

&gt; “It is more than two years now; we have a separate state but we are without a high court. The Centre had advised the CMs of Telangana and AP to discuss and allocate separate buildings for establishing separate HCs but while Telangana is ready to allocate separate building for AP High Court, AP CM N Chandrababu Naidu has not made any move yet,” says president of Telangana Advocate Joint Action Committee T Sriranga Rao. Officials in AP say that space for AP HC has been allocated at Amaravati alongside the capital buildings, and it would be established soon.


[Source1](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/telangana-judges-hyderabad-high-court-mass-leave-2881808/)


&gt; “We have been demanding a separate High Court from the past two years, as after the formation of Telangana state there is no separate High Court for the new state. The central government had promised us many times that a separate High Court for Telangana would be created. But we recently celebrated the second birthday of Telangana, and till now there has been no separate High Court,” explained Govardhan Reddy.

#Role of the BJP:


&gt; **BJP supports Telangana judges' protest** and (is against) the injustice being meted out to them...BJP spokesperson Krishna Saagar Rao said.

[Source3](http://www.firstpost.com/india/demand-for-telangana-hc-200-judicial-officers-go-on-mass-leave-2861206.html)

Also, not only that:

From Source1:

&gt; T Sriranga Rao and others met Union Law Minister D V Sadananda Goud and Secretary (Personnel) DoPT Sanjay Kothari to discuss the issue. Goud assured the delegation that he would speak with acting Chief Justice Dilip P Bhosale to sort of the issue.

From Source2:

&gt; He added that Law Minister DV Sadananda Gowda had visited Hyderabad during the 2014-15 MLC elections, and had also given his personal assurance at the time that a separate High Court would be setup within three months, but again the promise was not fulfilled.


#Xenophobia? Really?


&gt; “We do not mind having people hailing from AP as Judges here, but posting them here when there are vacancies there is not proper. There are anywhere between 10,000 and 12,000 practising advocates in Telangana,” he said.

#The Real Deal:

2298,"&gt; Unfortunately, for reasons best known to it, the state government refused the offer.""

What a spinmeister!

Piyush himself had stated months ago why Karnataka *couldn't* avail of extra power:

&gt; Union minister of state for power Piyush Goyal categorically ruled out additional power to Karnataka from the national grid **simply because of transmission constraints in the state**. ""Currently, north India is stuck with surplus power production, but the southern states that are grappling with supply shortage are unable to use or buy it because they **do not have the transmission capacity or power corridor**,"" Goyal said after a meeting with Karnataka power minister DK Shivakumar and a team of top officials here.


[Source: Centre has more power, but Karnataka has no transmission capacity](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Centre-has-more-power-but-Karnataka-has-no-transmission-capacity/articleshow/48704705.cms?from=mdr)


But further in the same article:

&gt; Goyal, who also holds the coal portfolio, however, said the Centre will provide ample amount of coal for thermal power plants in Karnataka to boost its production. Goyal said both the central and state governments will work to resolve the power problem in the state. ""I am extremely happy that Karnataka's minister Shivakumar is showing a resolve to work as Team India advocated by Modi,"" he added.

Why the sudden change in attitude?

He can do anything with anybody he wants. 


&gt; But he did, and there's still ""savarna bias""? 

The 'savarna bias' is because Khadse's removal smacks of being an insider job, so that a Brahmin gets established as the unchallenged leader in Maharashtra Government. Expecting you to acknowledge that logic, will be too much.

&gt; There's literally no winning with you. You're just a pathetic attention whore troll, like that 840blazeit faggot.

The entire point of this post is to wrongly allege Shiv Sena of favoring Khadse over his caste. The entire article..

&gt; Mumbai: The Shiv Sena has alleged that Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis had ""secretly"" worked to oust his former cabinet colleague and senior BJP leader Eknath Khadse, who resigned after a string of allegations, including irregularities in a land deal.

&gt; ""Eknath Khadse might have thought that Devendra Fadnavis, a yesterday's lad, would not understand politics. He thought he was the government. But he failed to know that this yesterday's lad was packing the (fire)cracker with gunpowder,"" the Shiv Sena said in an editorial in party mouthpiece 'Saamana'.

&gt; It alleged that the Anti Corruption Bureau was behind Eknath Khadse's Personal Assistant Gajanan Patil for the last six months, but Mr Khadse had no clue about it. ""By this, we understand the secrecy in the working style of Devendra Fadnavis,"" it stated.

&gt; The Shiv Sena has questioned why Mr Fadnavis did not once come forward to defend his colleague.

&gt; ""Eknath Khadse is saying there is no proof against him and he will leave politics if he is proved guilty. Even Chhagan Bhujbal is saying the same thing in jail, Ashok Chavan, accused of Adarsh scam, too is saying the same thing. Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra is also saying he is innocent of the allegations levelled against him,"" it said.

&gt; Mr Khadse resigned on Saturday in the wake of a series of allegations including irregularities in a land deal in Pune, getting calls allegedly from fugitive gangster Dawood Ibrahim's residence in Karachi on his phone besides the alleged bribe sought by his personal aide.

&gt; Following this, Mr Fadnavis announced an inquiry by a retired high court judge into the allegations against Mr Khadse, as sought by the senior leader himself.

&gt; Maharashtra’s education minister Vinod Tawde said in a press release after the after the meeting, “We accept the Supreme Court’s decision, but this year we want to be allowed to conduct admission through CET. The CET and NEET syllabus are different and this has created difficulty for students. Also our state’s CET has brought private and government colleges under its ambit, so there is no scope for unlawful activities in admissions.”

&gt; In the meeting he had also raised the issue that students cannot answer NEET in Marathi or Urdu, which they could do in CET.

The Brahmin priests strongly protested his statements saying theirs is not a business and they are not traders to levy a fixed service charge. Haridwar witnessed agitations, and Tarun's effigy was burnt by protestors. The Brahmins asked Tarun to issue a public apology else threatened to make BJP pay in the coming Assembly polls.

Meanwhile, the attack on Tarun occurred when he led a group of Dalits into a temple at Vikasnagar, Dehradun that had banned entry of Dalits. Angered at breaking of tradition in this manner, locals and some associated with temple management rained stones on Tarun and the accompanying group of Dalits. Angered people tossed Tarun's vehicle into the valley. Accompanying Dalit leader Daulat Kunwar and his family are missing, the possibility of their being slayed has not been ruled out. The issue of temple entry for Dalits has always been controversial but the involvement of a Rajya Sabha MP made it a serious event this time around. Police had taken precautions but these obviously turned out to be inadequate as it emerged that they were reduced to mute spectators while the agitated people went about beating up the visitors. Only with much difficulty could police extract Tarun to safety.

And what I'm trying to tell you is that the Pandavas killing the Kauravas too was very akin to burning down their castle. Because the Great War is said to have been so devastating in physical and moral terms, Bharat never really completely recovered. And thence started our gradual slide. But that does not take away the import of Krishna's message, that it was an essential war. To fight injustice, to set an example. Krishna also did say everyone involved including He will have to pay the price. And they did. But today we don't lament the price paid, we glorify that the Pandavas rose against injustice and tyranny.

Babua, I asked you for a citation for the following passage:

&gt; A noted historian Dr. Beni Prasad notes: ""The chief importance of the Deccan campaigns of the Mughals lies in the opportunities of military training and political power which they afforded to the Marathas. Malik Ambar, who was a great master of the art of guerrilla warfare as Shivaji himself, stands as the head of the builders of the Maratha nationality. His primary object was to serve the interest of his own master, but unconsciously he nourished into strength a power which more than avenged the injuries of the South on the Northern power.""

&gt; Ethiopian genes might survive instead in some peoplewho think of themselves as Maratha but Malik Ambar's legacy is cultural more than racial

Please elaborate.

&gt; many university have Malik Ambar in their syllabus with citations of Beni Prasad

Who is Beni Prasad? What are his credentials?

&gt; Marathas should recognise his contribution


What makes you presume they don't? Here:

&gt; The MSS, whose youth front, the Sambhaji Brigade ransacked the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute (BORI) in Pune to protest the writings of American writer James Laine which ‘denigrated’ Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and his mother Rajmata Jijabai, has supported the demand by Leftist intellectual Sharad Patil to name Aurangabad after Malik Ambar and Pune after Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj.

On the other hand, Fadnavis has said the state will pay the bill from the handout Centre has given to the state (much less than what Fadnavis had asked for).  Meanwhile, the very fact that Prabhu backtracked on the bill itself shows how inappropriate it seemed to ask for money when farmers are killing themselves at a rate of around nine per day. Prabhu has a track record of ignoring his home region like no one else out of some misplaced sense of nationalism. Every leader gives back to the people who elected them and there's nothing illegitimate about it. Modi talks of holding Olympics in Ahmedabad, Fadnavis has (rightly) channeled a lot of funds to Nagpur, even Vajpayee and Murli Manohar Joshi gave back to their constituencies. But Prabhu is a first class idiot. He has repeatedly let down the people of Mumbai and rest of Maharashtra.

(Another related issue is, Central Governments often treat Maharashtra with contempt in myriad ways - imagine people's consternation when this proud Hindu nationalist Union Government released less funds for the Nashik Kumbh than the Ujjain one, and asked the local Corporation to make up for the deficit, despite pleas for more financial help!)",2016-05-15 17:00:10+00:00,d36h0gt,6.0,t1_d36fe4d,2790.0,indianews

2877,"It is with bewilderment that I read your comment because after your initial apparently-profound criticism, the lack of understanding of Hindu philosophy inherent in your reply was rather sad. 

The Mahabharata is not denied by Hindus, but celebrated as an affirmation of the victory of 'right' over 'wrong'. The entire Bhagvad Gita is an elaborate exhortation by Krishna to Arjuna that he has to kill his own, because they erred badly, and also because an example needed to be set for the coming generations of humanity. So instead of wringing hands over the Great War for being destructive (very strongly reminiscent of arguments put forth in favor of banning the Bhagvad Gita in Russia), why not ruminate upon how true is the Hindu thought that everything moves in meta cycles. Bhishma *knew* what lay in store for him, the Kauravas and Bharatvarsha, but he was bound by his word and by his appreciation of the fact that the Great War was destined to happen, and that he was just playing his role in the Greater Scheme Of Things.

If at all, if there's indeed so much concern about a Mahabharata, maybe those with lofty ideals and goals should take a step back and reevaluate their priorities? But no, this burden is sought to be on those for who almost everything is on the line! In other words, you should pop up and lash out at the overwhelming majority here who break loose on me at the same time, some hitting well below the belt, for even mild disagreements with their stated stands. But I know you will never do that, you will never accede you should have done that. Because, politics.

On one hand you almost agree conflict is unavoidable and on the other, you declare me responsible for it? Because if conflict is indeed hardwired into human civilization, how can you blame anyone for it? 

The mighty Kauravas who had an upper hand could have avoided disrobing Draupadi, but they wanted to rub it in to the down-but-not-out Pandavas. In the end, it is the sclerotic system that failed to protect Draupadi that got a painful overhaul.

Vegetarians like you have also protected themselves by making meat eaters tie a broom to their waists that trails behind while walking so their dirty footprints don't soil pious souls like yours, or make them tie a pot around their necks so if the need arises to eject sputum, the pot takes care of the problem of possible spoilage of tender vegetarian bodies and minds. Also, meat eaters may also be asked to venture out only in the noon so their shadow is right under their feet and thus there's least chance of the dirty shadow falling upon sattvik people and thus rendering them impure..

Classic case of eating the cake and having it too. 

Vegetarianism/sattvikism in diet was advocated for people expected to engage in higher intellectual pursuits, or those who needed to lead a disciplined and rather frugal life if they were handling something that requires one to be alert and oriented all the time, like if you own a business. So sattvikism in diet was the prerogative of certain varnas only. It is up to followers of MSG or Radhe Ma to embrace sattvikism. 


But it is another thing to say someone not from an exclusive vegetarian community is not good enough to be your neighbor. Fuckwad Banias/Gujaratis/Jains in Mumbai do that. And if followers of MSG/Radhe/Sri Sri/any other cult also do that, they're fuckwads too.

Hence, Modi's fling with the Vatican is a betrayal of the proud Hindu nationalist cause. I know you understand this very well, but since defending Modi at any cost is the supreme goal of all bhakts, you will never ever admit this.

Unbridled sattvikism is what ruined one of the frontier provinces of Bharat long ago, ignoramus. Every guna has its own place and BJP is being stupid politicizing it by prioritizing one set of people over other.

Rest everything you typed out is drivel.

&gt; The BJP has gone a step ahead to paint one of the tallest socialist leaders of the state in saffron. In an invitation card issued by the party, it named the flyover as the Ram Mandir Flyover. This, despite group leaders in the BMC finalising its name as the Late Mrinaltai Gore Flyover in a meeting on March 10.

&gt; Congress corporator Pravin Chheda called it a “shameful attempt by the BJP to promote its saffronisation agenda”. “This must be condemned. Their own group leader had agreed to the name and now they are using it as a tool to play communal politics. We condemn the BJP for its dirty tricks,” Chheda said. Unlike today’s Goregaon, a citadel of saffron forces, this western suburb was dominated by socialist and leftist politicians till the late ’80s, and Gore was the undisputed leader. Even after the Sena came to power in the BMC in the mid-eighties, Gore along with late Comrade Ahilya Rangnekar and others stood firmly against saffron politics, which eventually peaked in early ’90s.

&gt; Gore is better known to Mumbai as Paniwali Bai – a woman who fetched water. As a BMC corporator, she was the instrumental in bringing a resolution which mandated that proceedings in the civic body must be held in Marathi.

&gt; Veteran journalist and political commentator Kumar Ketkar said BJP uses such “cheap tactics” in a very calculated manner. “They are purposely doing it to stoke communal sentiments. Above all, it is an attempt to subvert the legacy of Mrinaltai, which is very objectionable,” he said.

&gt; A: I trusted the chief minister but I want to tell you that his response exposed his double standards. On the one hand, he was tweeting there should not be any discrimination. The acting advocate general filed a response before the High Court that women should be allowed but when we tried to enter the sanctum sanctorum we were attacked and manhandled by the police. Fadnavis preferred to keep mum on the entire incident of April 2. CM is watching silently both Trimbakeshwar and Mahalaxmi temple campaigns. I condemn his silence.

3294,"&gt; A gobarmint that developed infra and gives the finger to centre and pursue it's single point agenda of increasing throughout for the city with good roads and ease of business. . . piep dream ?? Maybe , but doable

Assuming you're talking of local self-government, how is it possible for them to 'give the finger to the Centre', when it is well-documented that devolution of powers to local levels [is far from satisfactory](http://www.mumbaimirror.com/mumbai/civic/In-5-yrs-state-cleared-just-one-out-of-BMCs-169-proposals-for-city/articleshow/45276705.cms) and people's elected representatives are [not heard by mighty officers](http://www.mumbaimirror.com/mumbai/civic/Now-BMC-chief-under-fire-for-sidelining-corporators/articleshow/47807143.cms) appointed by a dispensation far removed from the ground?

Assuming you think the Sena can never do better and that hypothetically someone else (let's say BJP) can, you just need to look at the state of India's urban sprawls to gauge how the agitational mode of Sena politics actually works in favor of citizens when it is babus-vs-citizens. The BJP rules the state's second largest city, the winter capital of Maharashtra. What did BJP do there? Here:

The party that sells dreams of development also rules the corporations in the nation's capital. [Here](http://www.ndtv.com/cities/delhi-police-mcd-found-most-corrupt-424277).

Now despite that BJP has had a limited presence in our city, just consider the [stuff they indulged in](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/BJP-isolated-as-BMC-votes-to-stop-builders-who-prohibit-meat-eaters/articleshow/45301240.cms) which can be considered a sign of their intent.

No other city in India faces the kind of geographic, demographic and political constraints as does Mumbai. For example handicapped girls born and raised in the faraway cowbelt one day just come to Mumbai, and suddenly now that they call themselves Mumbaikars, demand two life guards helping them in a swimming pool built for mill workers' kids! The city operates almost magically under tremendous duress. One person dies on the rail tracks every two hours, every day; Mumbaikars have been waiting for the Rail Min (for the first time hailing from Konkan) to do something asap but zilch! And they say the PM got heartache when 40 died in a Japan earthquake recently (ॐ शान्तिः शान्तिः शान्तिः).

And yet, Mumbai today remains a city that simply grows on you. Warts and all. And I believe the Sena is an integral part of the cityscape. Without them, this city will be more like Dholera/Palitana or Malappuram or Kolkata. It will never be Mumbai for sure.

Source?

Edit:

Never mind, found it:

&gt;  BJP MLA Ashish Shelar's demand for a subsidy for Christians to visit Jerusalem has evoked strong reactions from the community.

&gt; **Dolphy D'Souza, ex-president, Bombay Catholic Sabha, said Christians had not made the demand, and it was unacceptable**. ""We do not need such patronization from the government. Our community needs empowerment, security and protection of our rights. We want communal harmony and peace,'' he said.

&gt; The demand has raised eyebrows as the Church does not require its followers to make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, the Vatican or any other holy place. In fact, the Church urges its followers to contribute for providing medical aid and education facilities to the poor.

&gt; Gordon D'Souza, president, Bombay Catholic Sabha, said it was the last of the seven demands made to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis when community members met him with regard to the attack on the Panvel church. ""It is not our focus at all,'' he said.

&gt; **Bandra activist Anil Joseph said the subsidy was not needed. ""It is nothing but vote-bank politics. The Congress did it for Muslims and there is no need for the BJP to do the same for Christians. Such appeasement creates resentment and a divide,'' he said.**

As they rushed to the police to resolve the situation, the political wheels were set in motion.

No wonder then that the Orthodox Church got their proxies to try getting the [Bhagwad Gita banned in Russia](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/tkpsr/brahmin_sperms_in_high_demand_among_childless/c4nml8t) saying 'the Gita advocates violence'!",2016-04-24 15:27:08+00:00,d2feqrh,2.0,t1_d2fcq36,3864.0,indianews

Edit:

Meanwhile, even as apologists of Jainatvavaadi party spin *jumlas*, to portray themselves as the sole custodians of the Right, the only major pro-Hindu political organization out of the chaddis' Parivar also keeps a tab on the naughty antics of the *p*seculars:

&gt; Auditoriums in Pune, particularly the ones owned by the municipal corporation, are not easy to come by. So, when the police trashed the venue chosen to host the rally to be addressed by Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union (JNUSU) president Kanhaiya Kumar on grounds of security, the organisers of the event — the Progressive Students Youth Action Committee (PSYAC) — were thrown in a quandary. As they rushed to the police to resolve the situation, the political wheels were set in motion. Soon, in stepped the mayor, Prashant Jagtap, ordering the management of Balgandharva Rangmandir to cancel on a hall booking made a month ago for a musical concert by the eminent Hindustani classical vocalist Sanjeev Abhyankar.


&gt; ""The mayor has misused his powers for political gain. He had no business to cancel an existing booking. PMC does not cancel others bookings even for its own events. We will be raising this issue in the next general body meeting,"" thundered Shiv Sena leader in Pune Municipal Corporation, Ashok Harnaval.

3440,"&gt; factually wrong

Consider this:

&gt; In 2015, as many as 214 suicides of farmers were reported from the eight districts of Marathwada. In 2016, the figure has jumped to **273** suicides in the first three months of this year.

[Source: Marathwada: All govt schemes in place, yet 59 more farmers end life than last year](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/marathwada-farmer-suicides-stats-maharashtra/)

&gt; As many as **3,228** farmers committed suicide in Maharashtra in 2015, the highest since 2001, according to data tabled in the Rajya Sabha on March 4. That amounts to almost **nine farmers every day**.

[Source: In drought-hit Maharashtra, nine farmers commit suicide every day](http://scroll.in/article/806280/in-drought-hit-maharashtra-nine-farmers-commit-suicide-every-day)


The '273' figure is for the first three months of this year. While the 'nine per day' comes from last year's 3,228 as per data tabled in Rajya Sabha, evidently by Central Government.

So, none of the figures is wrong.

All this talk of 'Madarsa maths' is just *jumlebaazi* by a group within the Parivar who're unwilling to acknowledge the seriousness of the farmers' suicide problem. They'd rather resort to name-calling - farmers are cowards, criminals, impotent, lovelorn, fashion-wannabes etc. Anybody who dares criticize them is [deemed unworthy](http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/BJP-MP-Slams-Goa-RSS-Chief-for-Criticism-Over-Language-Issue/2016/04/07/article3367682.ece) or a hater of Vedic maths.",2016-04-09 04:22:28+00:00,d1vuhkj,2.0,t1_d1vs9uj,4634.0,indianews

You may be asked to learn the local language so you can effectively propagate the message of the Sangh. Point is, what position do they assume on the issue of competition among Indian languages. Sanghis deride pro-Marathi attempts as 'chauvinism' or 'provincialism', and it's clear they just want Marathi to roll over and play dead.

Long ago, a certain St Francis Xavier came to Goa to preach the gospel. He was appalled at the ritual practices of the heathens of Hindoostan:


&gt; For whatever may be alleged of the higher teaching and hidden doctrines of Hinduism, even Brahmanism, the popular forms of worship were repulsive, and when not repulsive, grotesque. Vishnu with his never-ending transformations into the foulest shapes, Shiva with his shameless passions, Kali the goddess that clamored for human sacrifices, the many-headed and many-armed gods and goddesses whose hideous forms grinned from the temples and altars where the most degrading rites practiced, could only terrify and degrade the people among whom they were found.

He was the one who is said to have instituted the terrible [Inquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa_Inquisition#Persecution_of_Hindus) in Goa.

Proud Hindu Nationalist Party now rules Goa, and..

&gt; The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Goa Friday said it would be ""proud"" to host Pope Francis I if he decided to visit the 2014 exposition of Spanish Jesuit St. Francis Xavier.

.


&gt; Goa Government has said that the decennial exposition of relics of St Francis Xavier scheduled in December this year will be publicized across the globe to attract maximum tourists for the event.

&gt; “This is a unique event for Goa. Tourism department will ensure that all efforts would be made to attract tourists from the Europe to witness this exposition”, State Tourism Minister, Dilip Parulekar said on Sunday.

&gt; He said the central government has shown interest in joining hands with state tourism department in promoting this event. Last year, 3.5 million tourists arrived in Goa, which was almost one million more than 2.4 million arrivals reported a year before, he said.

&gt; “The department’s attempts to attract tourists through various road shows and events is fetching good response. We want to take the efforts further”, he said while hoping that the publicity for the St Francis Xavier exposition event will get more than one lakh additional tourists.

&gt; A recent meeting of Goa Chief Minister, Manohar Parrikar, with Union Tourism Minister, Shripad Naik, in Panaji gave in-principle approval for the proposal wherein state and the Centre will spend around Rs four crore on the campaign.

&gt; Goa, where Catholics comprise nearly 30 percent of the state's 1.4 million people, wants to invite Pope Francis to the exposition of Spanish saint Francis Xavier, scheduled to be held later this year.

&gt; The external affairs ministry would be requested to invite Pope Francis for the exposition, union Minister of State for Tourism Shripad Naik, elected from Goa, said Saturday.

&gt; And this is what Gurvinder, who is known to call a spade a spade, says:

&gt; &gt; I don’t think this is a national award, this looks more like BJP national awards.

&gt; &gt; If films like Bajrangi Baijaan or Baahubali get awards, I don’t know what kind of cinema is being promoted.

&gt; &gt; If the jury has decided to reduce National Awards to the level of Filmfare Awards, it is their wish.

&gt; &gt; **Just because there is a Punjabi regional film category, I get an award in that.** It is not at all a happy moment for me. 

&gt; &gt; No, my phone has not been ringing, neither am I getting congratulatory messages. In fact, my team hasn’t sent me a single message because they are shocked on the film’s nomination.

I raised a point at the Maharashtra Assembly and asked for clarification. CM Devendraji immediately obtained clarification from Union ministry.”

&gt; With around 25 thousand fans and followers at the beach and a cloudy sunset, Girgaum chowpatty might have never looked like it did on Sunday night.

&gt; Churches of Mumbai have been coming together and celebrating Prabhu Yeshu Janmotsav on the second Sunday of every December since the past 50 years. To mark the golden jubilee anniversary of the event they invited the international band Hillsong United to perform.

&gt; Organisers of the event faced a crisis on Saturday night when the bulldozers sent by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) arrived to dismantle the stage. Dr Abrahaman Mathai, chairman of Prabhu Yeshu Janmotsav, said, ""We had all the documents needed for verification and the permissions required in place. They came at around 10 pm with bulldozers saying that we did not erect the stage where we had planned. This is not true. Our volunteers did not let them take down the stage but it was a nightmare. We will file a complaint against them.""

&gt; Ashish Shelar, BJP MLA who was one of the dignitaries at the event also spoke about previous night's episode. He said, ""The Christian community is known for its 3 Ps - Peace Loving, Progressive &amp; not Power Hungry. I will do everything in my capacity to ensure this community is not disturbed.""

&gt; Some 4,000 people attend the Festival of Christmas held in Bandra, Mumbai. Titled ‘Let us celebrate the birth of Jesus together”, it was sponsored by Ashish Shelar, the new face of the local BJP.

&gt; The Supari Talao Ground in Bandra, Mumbai, hosted a Christmas concert attended by Christians, Hindus and Muslims. The event was organised to aid Atmavishwas, a NGO, and was sponsored by Ashish Shelar, the rising star of the local wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The 36-year-old attorney heads the Hindu nationalist party at the State level. The theme of the event was “Let us celebrate the birth of Jesus together”.

&gt; Nearly 4,000 people came to the Christmas festival to hear carols like ‘Holy Night’ and some original compositions like ‘It’s Christmas Day today’ written and performed by Bashir Sheikh, a Muslim singer.

&gt; The event ended in a sour note when police moved to stop the concert because of the noise.

&gt; For organisers, the police was unfair, but they complied with the injunction to avoid politicising the event.

&gt; Speaking to AsiaNews, Ashish Shelar said that the Christmas festival was an initiative designed to focus on ‘expression through culture”. 

&gt; For him, India’s secular values are enshrined in the constitution. “As a lawyer, I have defended the rights of the Christian community and it is admirable that it has never demanded anything illegal, and is known for dialogue, tolerance and peace.”

Are all these 'socialist' concerns?!


&gt; Remember when United States bailed out the banks to the order of several trillions ? Those were NPAs - all of them.

Yes, and that came in for severe criticism. Are you suggesting it is okay if the Government of India also bails out banks who gave out big, bad loans to fat cats?! Do you believe our institutional mechanisms are as robust as those in the West? Dude, we are a nation where community affiliations still matter a lot even in business. 

&gt; So talking about NPAs in like saying capitalism has its ills. OFCOURSE IT HAS ITS ILLS. But you cant just focus on them exclusively.

Seriously? All those grandstanding shows abroad and in Mumbai, the hype and hoopla surrounding permission for industries by email, reduction in number of clearances required, abolishing of labor laws and institution of self-certification, brazen attempt to bring in a Imperial-type Land Acquisition Act, statements about traders being braver than jawans? So much focus on business has created an atmosphere of selling-and-buying, even television commercials these days glorify the '*dukaan*' culture, and you're asking not to talk of NPAs because of exclusive focus on the ills of capitalism?! Wow, you will settle for nothing short of total domination, won't you?

Verbal gymnastics to wriggle out of tight corners is what the Brahmin-Bania party is adept at. For God's sake, they later conceded using *jumla* in their election campaign - this remains unprecedented in Indian history! BJP just puts a show that they're concerned about all equally, but the truth is that they place some communities' concerns above others'. In the long run, this will prove to be detrimental to Hindu society. For example, the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, which is the farmers' organization of the Sangh Parivar, had plans to protest at Vibrant Gujarat 2015 but the parent body pressurized them to drop the plans. This fact itself is illustrative of discontent within our own ranks. Same has happened with the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh. It is not for nothing that the national head of an organization, who is known to measure his words very carefully, set the cat among the pigeons by remarking against continuation of reservations right in face of the Bihar polls, which is one of the factors that is said to have surely dented BJP's score. Similarly, even in parts of Delhi known to be RSS strongholds, BJP fared very badly. The writing is on the wall and hence as someone who supported BJP since very long, it is a mixture of sorrow and anger to see them do exactly the opposite of what we always dreamed of, for Hindu society!

Prescriptions from RSS often percolate and have detrimental effects at the grass roots level.

&gt; If that was the case then Vajpayee would not have become PM because of his unusual family arrangement. 

At least Vajpayee had a family! If at all, you should give the example of Modi because he deserted his wife who still keeps seeking his company. If you analyze the behavior of *savarna* supremacist organizations like BJP and RSS who believe in social Darwinism, you'll realize it appears they believe the burden of nurturing conservatism for the supposed 'greater good' of society should be carried by the masses, while the elite few should be allowed the freedom of breaking out of the mold and achieving progress by staying ahead of the pack. Like how they rave and rant against English education and want the masses to adopt education exclusively in Indian languages. But their own leaders' kids go to English [in some cases, Christian] schools themselves. Thus, RSS wants say the average Mumbaikar to send his kid to a Marathi/Hindi/Gujarati school while [Fadnavis' kid goes to John Connon](http://i.imgur.com/UM2VsnT.jpg) school and thence remains a step ahead of her counterparts whose parents did the RSS' bidding.

Secondly, you are terribly misinformed or are incredibly conceited to make such statements when in fact:

&gt; Avkash Jadhav, the Sena's nominated corporator, said the survey did not include the promenade, which is as wide as the carriageway.

&gt; ""The footpath and the promenade is dark after LEDs have been installed,"" said Jadhav. ""This was not the case with sodium-vapour lights. The most crowded part of Marine Drive is plunged in darkness. It poses a safety risk for pedestrians. **We are not against LED and energy conservation..**

&gt; I'm not the blind follower in this thread, OP. You're the one bringing strawmen up and beating them down yourself. I asked you two simple questions. And what do you come up with? ""What about you and the party you support""

In this very thread, your indulgence in naivete and/or deliberate obfuscation of documented facts lies bare! Doesn't really add much to your credibility especially since the political battle is one with high stakes involved.

&gt; Pathetic. You're a waste of time, and people like you are a waste of a thinking, functioning human being. I'm done with you. You're as bad as an INC supporter, you just read more to gather arsenal against ""others"". Keep doing that. 

Laughable, really. You drag in dynastic politics in a submission about an art installation, toss in a few lies and when those are refuted, change goalposts and when again challenged, throw a tantrum and run off the field hurling abuses!

&gt; Of course. You and your ""us against the world"" mentality is what will reduce you and yours to the side show. Once known for fighting for the will of the people to now pretty much organizing bandhs. It's been a steep fall.

Coming from a blind supporter of Nationalists, who mock farmers pushed to suicide as cowards/impotent/criminals/followers of a 'fashion', term the guys who keep our borders secure as less brave than profit mongering tradesmen, double-tax precious savings and reduce interest rates on the same of the less market-savvy, break up and suppress farmers' and workers' agitations, promise quotas to communities on poll eve and then adopt delaying tactics, prioritize bullet train travel from Ahmedabad to Mumbai while one person dies every two hours on the railway tracks in the city that sees 'super dense crush load' in the locals, and gives handouts to traders in the form of land and electricity at discounted rates while kids of farmers commit suicide because their parents couldn't afford a monthly bus pass for commuting to school, all of this propagandish nonsense is utterly meaningless and pales into insignificance in light of how your party is messing up India and her people.

&gt; Yes, I'm the one who brought BJP and other silly fucked up innuendos in the thread.

Look who's talking - someone who dragged in 'dynastic politics' in a thread about an art installation!

&gt; Answer two questions, and nothing else: Are you OK with being part of a dynastic party, a la INC?

Are you okay with being part of a party that proposes perpetuation of untouchability and anti-homosexual discrimination? 

&gt; Do you support all their acts, or will you ever acknowledge that they were wrong? If you're a blind person prostating to a family name, I have nothing to say to you anymore and this might very well be my last reply to any of your comments, because you're the sickness that has ailed this country for 60 years, and still ails our very own GOP. I don't believe anymore in talking with people who can't admit to their ills.

Do you support Hosabale's contention that gays should be considered 'psychological cases'?! Do you agree with Rajnath's declaration that homosexuality is unnatural? If you don't, why do you continue supporting that party? Blabbering on and on how political rivals are evil/misguided without first evaluating yourself is not going to do you or others any good.

3783,"&gt; A natural varient doesn't make it non subject to treatment. AIDS is a natural occurance. Cancer is natural too. So is sociopathy and a whole host of other dangerous and malignant issues.

By that logic, even heterosexuals are fit candidates for such 'treatment'. 

But still, [treatment is defined as](http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/treatment): 

&gt; 1. the management and care of a [patient](http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/patient);

&gt; 2. the combating of a [disease](http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/disease) or [disorder](http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/disorder);




AIDS and cancer are deviations from the state of [health](http://www.who.int/about/definition/en/print.html). Two adults consenting to have sex with each other is no sociopathy because by itself, homosexuality does not harm any member of the society.

So no matter how many hoops of words you jump through or verbal gymnastics you perform, there's no way 'treatment' for being homosexual can be justified.


Also:

&gt; Various psychiatric bodies like the American Psychological Association, Royal College of Psychiatrists, UK, and Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists have already published policy and position statements mentioning that homosexuality is not a psychiatric disorder and laid good psychiatric practice guidelines in such consultations.

&gt; Vikruti evam prakruti.

What appears unnatural, is also natural. If something occurs in reality, without human intervention, it is a natural event.

That actually legitimizes deviation from the heterosexual normative expectation as being a natural occurrence. So a gay guy needs as much counselling as does a heterosexual guy.

&gt; Not that I'm suggesting homosexuality needs counselling. I'm just saying I dont have a problem with people of the opinion that they need counselling. Got it? Good, now stop being intolerant.

You might not have a problem with 'people of the opinion that they need counselling'.

3784,"BJP is a party of Brahmins and Banias whoi believe in social Darwinism because they are well aware that their communities have had a head start in Indian society. The *savarnas* who were always under duress that they have to behave in accordance with their *dharma* as prescribed by their *varna* slowly undermined scriptures that penalized them for deviating from set rules of behavior. So Brahmins who were asked to live frugal lives in pursuit of higher intellectual goals became rich and indulgent, amassing wealth from the laity in the name of doing God's work. In fact, under British rule which was given a toehold in India when Banias of Surat collaborated with them in setting up trade, the *savarnas* prospered by allying with Imperial masters. There are accounts how the Banias of Bombay got worried when the First War of Independence sparked off in India, and how they were relieved when it was crushed ruthlessly by the British. Business knows no patriotism. And today, BJP is more about business than about Hindu society. This is why they crush farmers' and workers' agitations as they did during Vibrant Gujarat 2015, Rajasthan HMSI and Gujarat Tata, and mock farmers pushed to suicidal desperation by calling them cowards, criminals, impotent and followers of a fashion! No wonder Bombay HC has severely reprimanded the state government for ignoring the plight of drought-affected farmers. This, while the Brahmin-Bania enterprise named BJP goes on giving land and electricity to traders at discounted rates. What's more, the chief of this enterprise brazenly called traders as being braver than jawans, thus revealing his extreme pro-trader mentality wherein he has always placed traders' interests over those of everyone else.

&gt; There was minimal scientific rationale behind the AMA removing it from the list. The decision was largely political.

Actually, no. 


It is just that the political activism surrounding the APA Annual Conferences overshadows the fact that scientific literature had emerged that eventually led to the removal of homosexuality from the DSM. Here:

&gt; The American Psychiatric Association (APA) removed homosexuality from its official Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) in 1973. This decision occurred in the context of momentous cultural changes brought on by the social protest movements of the 1950s to the 1970s: beginning with the African-American civil rights movement, then evolving on to the women's and gay rights movements.

&gt; Just as influential in the APA's decision were the research studies on homosexuality of the 1940's and 1950's. Alfred Kinsey's and colleagues' study on male and female sexuality marked the beginning of a cultural shift away from the view of homosexuality as pathology and toward viewing it as a normal variant of human sexuality. Kinsey had criticized scientists' tendency to represent homosexuals and heterosexuals as ""inherently different types of individuals."" Therefore, he introduced a 0 to 6 scale to classify sexual behavior or fantasy from ""exclusively heterosexual"" to ""exclusively homosexual"" (the ""Kinsey Scale""). The ""Kinsey Reports"" found that 37% of males and 13% of females had at least some overt homosexual experience to the point of orgasm; furthermore, 10% of males were more or less exclusively homosexual and 8% of males were exclusively homosexual for at least three years between the ages of 16 and 55. This is where the frequently quoted ""10%"" figure comes from. 2-6% of women reported more or less exclusively homosexual experience or response. A more modest 4% of males and 1-3% of females had been exclusively homosexual after the onset of adolescence until the time of the interview.

&gt; &gt; ""Males do not represent two discrete populations, heterosexual and homosexual. The world is not to be divided into sheep and goats. It is a fundamental of taxonomy that nature rarely deals with discrete categories... The living world is a continuum in each and every one of its aspects."" (Kinsey, et al. 1948 Sexual Behavior in the Human Male (1948), p. 639). 

&gt; Clellan Ford and Frank Beach's Patterns of Sexual Behavior (1951), relying on data from the Human Relations Area Files, found homosexuality to be common across cultures and to exist in almost all nonhuman species. Their work supported the notion that homosexuality was both natural and widespread. 

&gt; Psychologist Evelyn Hooker's groundbreaking study compared the projective test results from 30 nonpatient homosexual men with those of 30 nonpatient heterosexual men. The study found that experienced psychologists, unaware of whose test results they were interpreting, could not distinguish between the two groups. This study was a serious challenge to the view that homosexuality was always associated with psychopathology.

&gt; Homosexuality had been officially classified as a mental disorder in the APA's first Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-1) in 1952. There it was designated as a ""sociopathic personality disturbance."" Viewing homosexuality as a mental illness was not controversial at the time as it coincided with prevailing societal attitudes. DSM-II, published in 1968, listed homosexuality as a sexual deviation, but sexual deviations were no longer categorized as a sociopathic personality disturbance.

&gt; The publication of DSM-II coincided with the emergence of the gay rights movement. The Stonewall riots in 1969 in New York City marked a watershed event in the movement. Having successfully challenged the police and government attempts to shut down public places where gay people gathered, gay activists would soon challenge psychiatric authority as well.

&gt; Before the Stonewall riots, homophile groups had accepted the medical view of homosexuality as a mental disorder. Their view had been that accepting homosexuality as disease meant treating it as a disability, rather than a moral or religious sin, and would lead to more objective and humane attitudes.

&gt; A new generation of gay rights activists viewed medical and psychiatric portrayals of homosexuality to be just as problematic as the religious views. Gay men and women were still being denied many basic rights and the designation of homosexuality as a mental disorder had only exacerbated antihomosexual societal prejudices, leaving gay men and women vulnerable in terms of their physical safety, economic security, and overall well being. 

&gt; Gay activists began to confront the APA about its position on homosexuality. There were a series of dramatic encounters between activists and psychiatrists at the annual meetings of the APA between 1970 and 1972. **While the opposition to the activists was vehement by some in the APA, there were increasing numbers of psychiatrists (e.g., Judd Marmor) who supported the activists' view. These were members who were familiar with the research findings showing that homosexuality occurred in large numbers of people, in persons who demonstrated normal psychological adjustment, and that it is present across a range of cultures.**

&gt; Dr. Robert Spitzer and other members of the APA Task Force on Nomenclature and Statistics agreed to meet with a group of gay activists who presented the scientific evidence to its members and convinced the Task Force to study the issue further. **The subsequent research review led the Nomenclature Committee of the APA to propose that homosexuality be eliminated from the DSM.** This proposal was approved by the APA's Council on Research and Development, its Reference Committee, and by the Assembly of District Branches before being accepted by the APA's Board of Trustees in December 1973. Other major mental health professional organizations, including the American Psychological Association and the National Association of Social Workers, soon endorsed the APA action. The decision to declassify homosexuality was accompanied by the passage of an APA Position Statement, which supported the protection of the civil rights of homosexual persons.

Can't see what does it have to do with homosexuality!

&gt; &gt; Passive Pedophilia is a personal choice made by individuals where there are no victims but still is looked at unfavorably. Similar to homosexuality.

Notable is the fact that at no point in this conversation have we deduced that consumption of 'such' content does  not encourage production of new content. So the contention that said personal choice does not result in any victims is baseless.

Secondly, if homosexuality is looked at unfavorably, the entire point of the issue surrounding decriminalization of homosexuality is that we should start making efforts towards rectifying that because it is after all a question between two consenting adults who love each other.

 

&gt; It looks like you are worried about wider implications on society when they are at best conjectures while curbing personal freedoms. But similar arguments about wider implications on society are made about homosexuality, they are derided or turned down for curbing on personal freedoms.

I am 'worried about wider implications on society when they are at best conjectures while curbing personal freedoms' *because* said implications are for children! While the issue of decriminalization of homosexuality has to do with the personal freedom of consenting adults.

&gt; In 2001, McHugh was appointed by President George W.

McHugh was against using new lines of embryonic stem cells derived from in vitro fertilization but was in favor of the use of stem cells derived from somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). In SCNT, the nucleus of a cell is removed and replaced by another cell nucleus. McHugh felt that cells created in this fashion could be regarded as tissue; whereas, stem cells taken from embryos caused the killing of an unborn child.[16]

The allusion to 'killing of an unborn child' is strongly reminiscent of fundamentalist Christian opposition to abortion [whereas the MTP Act was passed way back in 1972 in India and Hindus never had any similar problems with said 'killings of unborn children']. In fact, militant opponents of abortion have killed doctors and other medical staff performing abortions across the US. From the same source:

&gt; In 2002, McHugh was appointed to a lay panel assembled by the Roman Catholic Church to look into sexual abuse by priests.

Not surprising, is it? A sympathetic expert appointed to investigate wrongdoings within the Church.

.

Leftist-dominated media narratives extrapolated their championing of the local language, to an alleged hatred for English, and portrayed them as hypocrites :

[2.](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/All-eyes-on-Raj-Thackeray-sons-medium-of-study/articleshow/6096648.cms)

.

Notably, it was a Left-ruled state that banned English in primary education way back in 1983 which their apologists in media associate with ['wounds of the colonial years'](http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/as-west-bengal-now-knows-banishing-english-from-classrooms-achieves-nothing/1/263913.html), and yet the media portrayed the Shiv Sena's harmless initiative of change of name from Bombay to Mumbai, as incredibly chavunistic and the death knell for the city despite that this is [not unusual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_renaming) at all.

.

In fact, the Shiv Sena also supports Hindi as a possible national language, a fact that is often (deliberately?) glossed over by media in attempts to portray them as hating anything northern Indian.

. 

&gt; Manu Joseph also is weasel-like in talking about the cultural elite of Maharashtra and forgetting the cultural elite of Tamil Nadu, probably because he doesn’t want to criticise a “rationalist/secular/social justice” friendly party that rules the state. The Dravida Munnnetra Kazhagam (Party for the Progress of Dravidians) is a hardened Tamizh chauvinistic organization. Its intolerance of Hindi is legendary and would put Maharashtra’s Shiv Sena to shame. DMK bigots are known for thrashing Hindi teachers and vandalizing Hindi schools (Chennai’s Dakshin Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha), and Tamil Nadu too requires all business establishments to have signs in Tamizh.

Balasaheb once forced DMK to withdraw their anti-Hindi movie campaign in Madras by warning them of 'consequences' for movies financed by Tamil producers.

3947,"*Bhaiyya*, I don't keep asking for Marathwada state. I bring to notice how, come drought or hail, the people of Marathwada don't ask for statehood for their region on the basis of alleged backwardness or step-motherly treatment by the state government HQed in Mumbai. As opposed to demands for Vidarbha.

Because the demand of statehood for Vidarbha really has got not much to do with backwardness or exploitation - the common, simple folk of the region don't make humongous demands. The demand of statehood for Vidarbha is actually driven by rich moneylending Hindis and the privileged who stand to gain if and when a state government forms in Vidarbha.

&gt; Many Marathi-speakers do have a deep-seated fear that Hindi-speaking business community will dominate the new state.

&gt; Marathi literatteur Shripad Joshi has dwelled at length on this issue in his recently published book 'Vegala Vidarbha ki Akhand Maharashtra'. According to Joshi, Marathi speakers fear that Vidarbha would become a bilingual state.
""This is perfectly possible. The Hindi speakers will demand second language status for Hindi. With their hold on the economy and substantial numbers, some or the other political combine will yield to the demand,"" he claimed. ""When people raise the demand for separate Vidarbha in Hindi or poor Marathi, the Marathi speakers feel insecure,"" he added.


&gt; Joshi is not a Marathi chauvinist by any means. He has slammed leaders of Western Maharashtra for neglecting Vidarbha in his book. Some months ago, he flayed MNS chief Raj Thackeray for trying to create discord between Hindi and Marathi speakers in Vidarbha.
Shrikant Jichkar, former home and finance minister of the state, too used to say that separate Vidarbha would only benefit a handful of businessmen and harm the common Marathi people.
Farm activist Kishor Tiwari, who is a Hindi speaker, admits to the Hindi-Marathi divide. ""The farmers, most of whom are Marathi speakers, hate the Hindi speaking moneylenders. When these moneylenders demand a separate state, the farmers naturally develop an aversion towards it. Marathi speaking leaders must lead the statehood movement. ""


&gt; A pro-Vidarbha Congress leader said, on condition of anonymity, ""The Hindi speaking MPs and MLAs are to a large extent responsible for this problem. Many of them can't speak Marathi properly. Marathi-speakers interpret this as contempt for their mother tongue. Many Hindi speaking businessmen have also added fuel to the fire by saying that Vidarbha should be a bilingual state. Marathi people may not have any objection to conversing in Hindi but they would bitterly oppose second language status to Hindi.""
In fact, the Fazal Ali Commission, which had strongly recommended statehood to Vidarbha in the 1950s, had made a veiled reference to dominance of Hindi-speaking money lenders on agrarian economy of the region and consequent ill will towards outsiders among the local populace

The company’s initial mandate was mainly to help State Electricity Boards energise pump-sets across the country to boost agriculture and overcome the crippling impact of three successive years of deficient monsoons. The company also provided finance to accelerate the pace of rural electrification in the overall context of planned programmes for increased agricultural production. Besides finance, REC also offered appraising, consultancy, technical support and monitoring of projects, to assist State Electricity Boards/Power Utilities, Rural Electric Cooperatives and other such institutions.

This, even as the Opposition and detractors slammed him for ‘once again striking a deal’ with the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) government.

&gt; “It is no secret that Mr Thackeray (Raj) has a secret understanding with the BJP and a few corporates. History will show you the repeated use of this tactic by him (Raj Thackeray): to create fear and then strike a deal with the powers to be, only to pull back the agitation later,” said Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) spokesperson Nawab Malik.

&gt; A day after spelling their security concerns regarding the Pakistan team in Mumbai, where the World Cup matches are to be held at five different grounds, it is learnt that the BCCI has asked the governing body to consider a change of venue for Pakistan games.

&gt; With the rising public sentiments following the tensions along the Line of Control (LoC) and with the government also taking a hard stance on the issue, the BCCI has urged the International Cricket Council (ICC) to relocate Pakistan's matches from India or reschedule the tournament considering the prevalent dynamics.

&gt; *With the BCCI playing hard, the ICC now has three options. It can either move all Pak matches to another country by appointing a co-host with India, move the tournament entirely out of India considering the prevailing conditions, or reschedule the tournament for a later date.*

&gt; Meanwhile, a day after Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut urged Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi to boycott Pakistani team if the World Cup matches of Pakistan were shifted out of Mumbai and allotted to the neighbouring BJP-ruled state, the Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA) on Wednesday ruled out the possibility of holding the matches.

&gt; **According to sources, the GCA turned down the BCCI's request to accommodate World Cup matches of Pak team that were being considered to be shifted out of Mumbai in the wake of Shiv Sena's protest.**

4233,"&gt; NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court Thursday ruled that the Commonwealth Games village, meant to accommodate over 8,000 athletes from 71 countries, is **not** being built on the Yamuna riverbed or floodplain.

&gt; A bench of Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan gave the verdict, dismissing a Delhi High Court judgement of November 2008 and removing all uncertainties over the ongoing construction of the Games village.

&gt; 'The observation and the conclusion of the Delhi High Court that the site in question is on a riverbed cannot be sustained. The high court disregarded and ignored **material scientific literature and the opinion of experts and scientific bodies**, which have categorically held that the Commonwealth Games Village site is not on a riverbed or the floodplain,' said the bench.

4312,"&gt; AICC TREASURER Motilal Vora has been persuading state party units to raise funds, ostensibly because the party is facing severe cash crunch. He has been sending letters to state chiefs in this regard. On Wednesday, almost all the state Congress chiefs were in Delhi to chalk out plans for the conclusion of the year-long nationwide celebrations to mark the 125th birth anniversary of Jawaharlal Nehru. As the meeting ended, Vora took the microphone and asked state chiefs to meet him. His announcement was followed by collective laughter, as all of them knew what Vora would inquire about.


[Source](http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/delhi-confidential-call-for-funds/)


&gt;  The latest controversy started with AICC general secretary Ahmed Patel's phone call to Deshmukh, in which the former is reported to have asked the chief minister to mobilise funds for the party's election campaign. What the AICC leadership is upset is the manner in which Pawar got wind of this highly confidential talk.

&gt; Pawar immediately remarked that the taxing demands of the AICC were a bit too much for the DF alliance.

&gt; It came as no surprise to Congressmen, then, that AICC general secretary and Maharashtra state in-charge Motilal Vora gave a tongue lashing to Deshmukh on February 9, when the two met in south Bombay.

4327,"&gt; Information on the Kapalikas (or ""skull-bearers"") gleaned from outsider commentaries, most notably Shankara's biographies, suggests that the group centred around bhakti devotion to Bhairava - Shiva in his most terrifying form. In order to accumulate merit, members of the Kapalika sect apparently undertook the Mahavratin, an extremely austere ritual of penance performed as punishment for the murder of a Brahmin. As their name would suggest, members of the Kapalika sect became famous for their association with human skulls, which doubled in function as a begging bowls and drinking cups. Accordingly, the Kapalikas were linked with any number of other horrifying practices, including meat-eating, intoxication, orgies, and even cannibalism, though these accusations were probably based largely upon polemical descriptions of the groups by outsiders.

.


&gt; Some of the initial movements in Kashmiri monism were made by Somananda, who formulated what would come to be known as the ""Pratyabhijna"" somewhere around the ninth century C.E.[18] Pratyabhijna placed an early focus upon consciousness as the essence of the universe as well as the will and the self. Monist opposition to Shaiva Siddhanta continued in this direction, being officially codified by Vasugupta (ca 800 C.E.) and carried on by his student Kallata (850-900 C.E.), culminating in the works of Abhinavagupta, who further elaborated Pratyabhijna thought. These monists considered Shiva to be the substrate of a ubiquitous self that existed between all persons. This transpersonal self attributed Shiva with the characteristics of both immanence and transcendence, rendering Him a real but also wholly abstract creator-preserver-destroyer. In accordance with Tantric influences, the Trika tradition claimed that the initiated Saiva householder was able to experience the power of transcendence for himself by offering meat, wine, and sexual fluids to eight mother goddesses and their embodiments, called yogini.[19] The Kramas, meanwhile, followed similar influences, dressing in skulls, frequenting cremation grounds, and propitiating the goddess Kali with meat and acts of caste-free sex in hopes that she would ""possess"" them.[20]

&gt; Many states of India like Maharashtra and Haryana have come under BJP rule. BJP is a party which is dominated by Northern and Western Hindus. **In Northern and Western India Hindus are quite often vegetarians being influenced by Jain and Vaishnavite philosophy**. The situation is entirely different in Eastern and Southern India.

&gt; Our BJP leaders are, therefore, under a wrong impression. There is no direct correlation between vegetarianism and Hinduism. If meat is banned on Navratras in Bengal there will be a revolt. Navratras is the main festive season in Bengal, Orissa, Assam when people eat non-vegetarian delicacies. Nobody usually eats vegetarian food on these days. If BJP starts banning non-vegetarian food, people of eastern and southern India and also the north east will never allow the party even a toe hold in these areas.

&gt; Meat eating in Hinduism has been codified in the Mahabharata in the chapter where Bhishma Pitamaha (the grand old patriarch) gives his sermon on “Mansahaar vidhi” (norms of meat eating or tamsik bhojan). He advises that meat is essential for people who do manual work, pregnant women and people convalescing from serious illnesses. People who are engaged in the field of learning and worship have been advised to avoid such food as far as possible. There is no ban on meat eating even on festive days. The governments of Maharashtra and Haryana should do some soul searching. Fortunately the Supreme court has already corrected these erring governments.

&gt; **7.10. Jains and Virashaivas**

&gt; A later offshoot of Shaivism, viz. the Virashaiva or Lingayat sect, also showed its hostility to Jainism repeatedly.  Indeed, Prof. Thapar’s next piece of evidence is that “inscriptions of the sixteenth century from the Srisailam area of Andhra Pradesh record the pride taken by Veerashaiva chiefs in beheading shvetambara Jains”.55 Concerning such cases, she alleges that: “The desire to portray tolerance and non-violence as the eternal values of the Hindu tradition has led to the pushing aside of such evidence.”56

&gt; Now, the Veerashaivas were an anti-caste and anti-Brahminical sect.  As these are considered good qualities, secularists have tried to link them to the influence of Muslim missionaries (“bringing the message of equality and brotherhood”), who were indeed very active on India’s west coast, where and when the Veerashaiva doctrine was developed.  If we assume there was indeed Muslim influence on the Veerashaiva sect, the secularists should acknowledge that the Veerashaivas’ occasional acts of intolerance may equally be due to the influence of Islam.  At any rate “Brahminism” cannot be held guilty of any misdeeds committed by this anti-Brahminical sect.

&gt; But it seems well-established that the Lingayats did give the Jains a hard time on several occasions.  Prof. Thapar’s continues: “The Jaina temples of Karnataka went through a traumatic experience at the hands of the Lingayats or Virashaivas in the early second millennium AD.”57 After a time of peaceful coexistence, which Romila Thapar acknowledges, “one of the temples was converted into a Shaiva temple.  At Huli, the temple of the five Jinas was converted into a panchalingeshwara Shaivite temple, the five lingas replacing the five Jinas in the sancta.  Some other Jaina temples met the same fate.”58

&gt; Could this be a case of a peaceful hand-over?  Maybe the community itself had converted and consequently decided to convert its temple as well?  After all, the temples were not destroyed.  No, because: “An inscription at Ablur in Dharwar eulogizes attacks on Jaina temples as retaliation for Jaina opposition to Shaivite worship.”59

&gt; **7.9. Did Hindus demolish Jain temples?**

&gt; During the Ayodhya conflict, Muslim and secularist polemicists tried to counter the Hindu argument about the thousands of Hindu temples razed by Islamic iconoclasm with the claim that Hindus had likewise destroyed or desecrated Buddhist and Jain temples.  While the few cases of alleged Hindu aggression against Buddhism are either of doubtful historicity or easily and credibly explainable from other motives than religious intolerance, there are a few cases of conflict with Jainism which seem more serious.  They have formed the topic of a debate between Marxist historian Romila Thapar and Sita Ram Goel.

&gt; For a start, in the 12th century, “in Gujarat, Jainism flourished during the reign of Kumarapala, but his successor [i.e. Ajayapala] persecuted the Jainas and destroyed their temples”.38 According to D.C. Ganguly: “The Jain chronicles allege that Ajayapâla was a persecutor of the Jains, that he demolished Jain temples, mercilessly executed the Jain scholar Ramachandra, and killed Ambada, a minister of Kumârapâla, in an encounter.”39

&gt; Here, the alleged crime is related by the victims, not by the alleged aggressors (as is usually the case for Muslim iconoclasm).  It is possible that they exaggerated, but I see no reason to believe that they simply invented the story.  However, since the Jains had been dominant (“flourishing”) in the preceding period, one might suspect a case of retaliation here.  We shall see shortly that in South India, what little of Hindu aggression against Jainism occurred was due precisely to earlier oppression by the Jains.

&gt; Ganguly adds that Jains had opposed Ajayapala’s accession to the throne: “After the death of Kumârapâla in AD 1171-72 there was a struggle for the throne between his sister’s son Pratâpamalla, who was apparently backed by the Jains, and Ajayapâla, son of Kumârapâla’s brother Mahîpâla, who seems to have been supported by the Brâhmanas.”40 Clearly, a political intrigue is involved of which we have not been given the full story.  Predictably, Goel comments: “The instance she mentions from Gujarat was only the righting of a wrong which the Jains had committed under Kumârapâla.”41

&gt; Next, there was the attack by the Paramara king Subhatavarman (r. 1193-1210) on Gujarat, in which “a large number of Jain temples in Dabhoi and Cambay” were “plundered” in retaliation of plundering of Hindu temples in Malwa by the Gujaratis during their invasion of Malwa under Jayasimha Siddharaja (d. 1143) who was under great Jain influence.  Harbans Mukhia cites this as proof that “many Hindu rulers did the same [as the Muslims] with temples in enemy-territory long before the Muslims had emerged as a political challenge to these kingdoms”.42 However, it is well-known that the Muslims did more than just plunder: even temples where there was nothing to plunder were desecrated and destroyed or converted into mosques in many places, for the Muslims’ motive was not merely economic.

&gt; The most important and well-known case of “persecution of Jains” is mentioned by Romila Thapar: “The Shaivite saint Jnana Sambandar is attributed with having converted the Pandya ruler from Jainism to Shaivism, whereupon it is said that 8,000Jainas were impaled by the king.”43 To this, Sita Ram Goel points out that she omits crucial details: that this king, Arikesari Parankusa Maravarman, is also described as having first persecuted Shaivas, when he himself was a Jain; that Sambandar vanquished the Jainas not in battle but in debate, which was the occasion for the king to convert from Jainism to Shaivism (wagers in which the second or a third party promises to convert if you win the debate are not uncommon in India’s religious literature); and that Sambandar had escaped Jain attempts to kill him.44 This Shaiva-Jaina conflict was clearly not a one-way affair, and as per the very tradition invoked by Prof. Thapar, Jains themselves had been the aggressors.

&gt; It is even a matter of debate whether this persecution has occurred at all.  Nilakanth Shastri, in his unchallenged History of South India, writes about it: ""This, however, is little more than an unpleasant legend and cannot be treated as history.”45 Admittedly, this sounds like Percival Spear’s statement that Aurangzeb’s persecutions are “little more than a hostile legend”46: a sweeping denial of a well-attested persecution.  However, Mr. Spear’s contention is amply disproves by contemporary documents including firmans (royal decrees) and eye-witness accounts, and by the archaeological record, e.g. the destruction of the Kashi Vishvanath temple in Varanasi by Aurangzeb is attested by the temple remains incorporated in the Gyanvapi mosque built on its site.  Such evidence has not been offered in the case of Jnana Sambandar at all.  On the contrary: “Interestingly, the persecution of Jains in the Pandya country finds mention only in Shaiva literature, and is not corroborated by Jain literature of the same or subsequent period.”47

&gt; On the other hand, the historicity of the Jain-Shaiva conflict in general is confirmed by Shaiva references to more cases of Jain aggression, none of which is mentioned by Romila Thapar.  Dr. Usha Sivapriya, before duly quoting classical Tamil sources, argues that the literatures posterior to Manikkavasaghar (an ancient Tamil sage, author of Thiruvasagham) “had plenty of reference to the nature, torture and terrorism of Jaina missionaries and rulers in Tamil kingdom”.48 It all started with the invasion by Kharavela, king of Kalinga, at the turn of the Christian era: “Kharavela defeated the Tamil kings headed by Pandiyans and captured Madhurai. The Kalinga or Vadugha king enforced Jaina rule in Tamil kingdom.  People were forcibly converted at knifepoint, temples were demolished or locked down, devotees were tortured and killed.”49

&gt; And it continued intermittently for centuries under Pandya and Pallava rule: “When the Digambara Jaina missionaries had failed in converting the masses, they tried to torture and kill them. (…) After failing in the attempt of converting Pandiyans the Digambara Jains tried to kill the Pandiyan Kings through various means, by sending a dangerous snake, wild bull and mad elephant.”50

&gt; Dr. Sivapriya links the advent of Jainism in Tamil Nadu with an episode of conquest by non-Tamils. Goel adds: “The persecution of Jains in the Pandya country by some Shaivas had nothing to do with Shaivism as such, but was an expression of a nationalist conflict which I will relate shortly.  What 1 want to point out first is that most of the royal dynasties which ruled in India after the breakdown of the Gupta Empire and before the advent of Islamic invaders, were Shaiva (…). The Jains are known to have flourished everywhere; not a single instance of the Jains being persecuted under any of these dynasties is known. (…) M. Arunachalam, in a monograph published eight years before Professor Thapar delivered the lectures which comprise her pamphlet (…) has proved conclusively, with the help of epigraphic and literary evidence, that the Kalabhara invaders from Karnataka had occupied Tamil Nadu for 300 years (between AD 250 and 550), and that they subscribed to the Digambara sect of Jainism.”51

&gt; So, this is where “nationalist” resentment against the conquerors came to coincide with resentment against Jainism: “It so happened that some of the Kalabhara princes were guided by a few narrow-minded Jain ascetics, and inflicted injuries on some Shaiva and Vaishnava saints and places of worship.  They also took away the agrahâras which Brahmanas had enjoyed in earlier times.  And a reaction set in when the Kalabharas were overthrown.  The new rulers who rose subscribed to Shaivism.  It was then that the Jains were persecuted in some places, and some Jain places of worship were taken over by the Shaivas under the plea that these were Shaiva places in the earlier period.”52

&gt; In such cases, “Professor Thapar does not mention the Jain high-handedness which had preceded. (... ) Professor Thapar should have mentioned the persecution of Shaivas practised earlier by the Pandya king who was a Jain to start with, and who later on converted to Shaivism and persecuted the Jains.  This is another case of suppressio verb suggestio falsi practised very often by her school.”53

&gt; To clinch the issue and confirm that the Pandya incident of persecution of Jains is atypical and disconnected from Hindu doctrines, Goel adds: “But the reaction was confined to the Pandya country. Jainism continued to flourish in northern Tamil Nadu which also had been invaded by the Kalabharas, where also the Shaivas and Vaishnavas had been molested by the Jains, and where also the Shaivas had come to power once again.  It is significant that though Buddhists also invite invectives in the same Shaiva literature, no instance of Buddhists being persecuted is recorded.  That was because Buddhists had never harmed the Shaivas.  It is also significant that the Vaishnavas of Tamil Nadu show no bitterness against the Jains though they had also suffered under Kalabhara rule.”54

&gt; **7.8. Dayananda on Jain sectarianism**

&gt; Swami Dayananda rebukes the Shramanas, particularly. the Jain monks, for keeping a haughty distance from others: “The Jains are strictly prohibited to 1) praise a person belonging to another religion or to talk of his good qualities, 2) to salute him, 3) to talk much to him, 4) to talk to him frequently, 5) to bestow upon him food and clothes, 6) to supply odoriferous substances and flowers to enable him to worship his idol.  Let the wise consider with what feelings of hatred, malice and hostility the Jainees are actuated in their relations with those who profess a religion different from theirs.”33

&gt; Similarly: “Again, the Jain teachers teach: ‘Just as a ruby, which is embedded in the head of a venomous snake, should not be sought after, even so it behoves the Jainees to shun the company of a non-Jainee, no matter how virtuous and learned he is.’ It is clear, therefore, that no sectarians are so much biased, perverse, wrong-headed and ignorant as the Jainees are.”34 Similar quotations to the same effect include: “Let not the Jainees even look at those that are opposed to the Jain religion.”35

&gt; Here, Dayananda definitely has a point.  The Shramana sects, consisting of people who had given up all worldly responsibilities and had thereby acquired ample leisure to concentrate on doctrinal matters, were quite literally sectarian.  Spending a lot of their time and energy on polemic against rival sects as well as against non-sect beliefs and practices, they produced a polemical literature which has no counterpart in pre-Buddhist Brahmanism.  The need, not so much of a sect’s founder but of his followers, to set the founder apart from his contemporaries, automatically leads to a somewhat hostile attitude towards other traditions, specifically those closely related.  It is part of this same tradition that contemporary Buddhists and Jains go out of their way to magnify the differences with Hinduism.

&gt; An aspect of Jain history not considered by Dayananda, is the influence of Islam on the Sthanakvasi branch of Jainism, founded by a Muni who lived at the court of Mohammed Shah Tughlaq 1325-51, and on its Terapanthi offshoot.  In imitation of Islam, these communities denounce temple-going and idol-worship, common enough among the Shwetambara mainstream (contrastively also known as Murtipujaka Sangha, “image-worshipping assembly”)36, and from there it is but a step to assuming that the social separatism enjoined in the passages quoted by Dayananda is equally due to Islamic influence; that interpretation has at least been given to me by Hindutva-minded Jains.  In my opinion, however, the purity notion intrinsic to Jain tradition (conceived as a need to avoid accumulating Karma) is sufficient as an explanation for this Jain practice of keeping distance from the uninitiated.

&gt; The allegation of haughtiness and keeping distance would of course fit orthodox Brahmins as well as Jain sectarians, but the Arya Samaj cannot be accused of double standards here, i.c. of neglecting to produce a similar anti-Brahmin invective.  On the contrary, it can take a certain dubious credit for “hinduizing” the anti-Brahmin rhetoric propagated by Christian missionaries.  What may, however, be held against the Arya Samaj, is that it is similarly sectarian itself, sometimes in a more aggressive way than the Jains as per Dayananda’s description.

&gt; In the early decades of the Samaj’s existence, its more zealous activists would disrupt traditional devotions and insult priests, with “pope” as a common taunt for Brahmins.  Some would even go into Hindu “idol temples” and relieve themselves right there to show their contempt for idolatry in no uncertain terms.37 Dayananda’s own writing against more traditional forms of Hinduism is very intemperate, full of harsh words and lacking in patience and human sympathy.  Sectarianism has made school inside Hindu society.

For some, it's not merely politics..

And for others, it's just about business:

&gt; फंस गए अनुराग ठाकुर:

&gt; असल में हिमाचल में मैच कराने का निर्णय बीसीसीआई के सचिव अनुराग ठाकुर का था। ठाकुर हिमाचल से ही जुड़े हुए हैं। ठाकुर भाजपा के सांसद भी हैं। अपने प्रदेश में क्रिकेट के जरिए धाक जमाने के लिए ही ठाकुर ने टी-20 मैच धर्मशाला में निर्धारित करवाया है। लेकिन एक मार्च को जैसे ही सीएम ने विरोध किया तो अनुराग ठाकुर बिलबिला उठे। अनुराग का कहना रहा कि विश्वकप प्रतियोगिता के मैच एक वर्ष पहले ही निर्धारित हो जाते हैं, लेकिन तब राज्य सरकार ने विरोध नहीं किया, अब जब दुनियाभर से बुकिंग हो गई है तथा मैच में मात्र 18 दिन शेष हैं, तब हिमाचल सरकार विरोध कर रही है। ठाकुर ने आरेप लगाया कि वीरभद्र सिंह राजनीतिक नजरिए से मैच का विरोध कर रहे हैं। हालांकि अभी इस पूरे मुद्दे पर भाजपा की कोई प्रतिक्रिया सामने नहीं आई है, लेकिन अनुराग ठाकुर को यह समझना चाहिए कि महाराष्ट्र में जो काम शिवसेना करती है, वहीं काम हिमाचल में वीरभ्रद सिंह कर रहे हैं। भाजपा से जुड़े अनेक संगठन भी समय -समय पर पाक खिलाडिय़ों और कलाकारों का विरोध करते रहे हैं। ऐसे में अनुराग ठाकुर को वीरभद्र के विरोध पर बिलबिलाना नहीं चाहिए। राजनीति में देश हित नहीं स्वयं का हित पहले देखा जाता है। कांग्रेस को अभी केन्द्र सरकार को नीचा दिखाने में फायदा है, इसलिए वीरभद्र सिंह को पाकिस्तान के खिलाफ खड़ा कर दिया है। यदि केन्द्र में कांग्रेस की सरकार होती तो यही वीरभद्र सिंह हिमाचल में कालीन बिछाकर पाक खिलाडिय़ों का इस्तकबाल करते और **यदि शिवसेना विरोध करती तो उसे साम्प्रदायिक करार दिया जाता**l

Lonesome farmers generally can also not come up with out-of-the-box ideas like forming co-operatives or self-help groups etc. They're used to following in the beaten track. This is why I always said during debates on the Land Acquisition Act, that a crore of rupees in the hands of a farmer who just sold his land are potentially much less than the same amount in the hands of a *setia*. Trust me, I have seen farmers who sold their land on the outskirts of Mumbai and 'earned' crores and simply blew up large portions of the newfound wealth (maybe they were unsuspectingly ripped off too, by people around them) and hence I couldn't convince myself they indeed do have a secure future. Essentially what happened was, they converted their strength (their immovable assets, their staying power) into a fickle asset, managing which is a strength of another set of people.

Which is why I believe farmers should always receive a helping/guiding hand from governments. Leaving them vulnerable to the vagaries of the open free market is like putting the wolf in charge of the sheep.",2016-02-29 19:49:05+00:00,d0iezvd,3.0,t1_d0ia7ki,6409.0,indianews

Meanwhile in Pandharpur:

&gt; पंढरपूर : टेंभुर्णीच्या भाजप युवा मोर्चाचे अध्यक्ष विजय कोकाटे यांना हायवेवर वाहन चालकांची लूटमार करताना पोलिसांनी अटक केली आहे. न्यायालयाने कोकाटे यांना 9 फेब्रुवारीपर्यंत पोलिस कोठडी सुनावली आहे.

 
&gt; या घटनेमुळे भाजप नेत्यांची कोंडी झाली असून अद्याप **कोकाटेंविरुद्ध भाजपने कोणतीही कारवाई केल्याची माहिती नाही**. विजय कोकाटेंसह साथीदार गणेश पाचंगेलाही यावेळी पोलिसांनी अटक केली.

 
&gt; पुणे-सोलापूर राष्ट्रीय महामार्गावर गाड्या आडव्या लावून वाहनचालकांना लुटण्याच्या घटनांत वाढ झाली आहे. नागरिकांच्या तक्रारीनंतर पोलिसांनी गस्त वाढवली होती. अशाच गस्तीच्या वेळी काही तरुण एका वाहनाला अडवून दमदाटी करत असल्याचं दिसलं.

 
&gt; पोलिसांनी पकडण्याचा प्रयत्न केल्यावर ते पळून जात असताना पोलिसांनी त्यांना अटक केली. या दोघांनी महामार्गावर अनेक गाड्या लुटल्याचा पोलिसांना संशय असून त्या पद्धतीने पोलिस तपास करत आहेत.

&gt; There has been an increase in incidents of looting drivers by creating roadblocks by parking vehicles across the highway, on the Pune-Solapur National Highway.

It is during such patrolling that they witnessed some youth indulging in bullying tactics after creating a roadblock by parking their vehicle on the highway.

&gt; When the police tried to apprehend them, they tried to escape but eventually were caught and arrested. Both the youth are suspected to have looted numerous vehicles on the highway and police are investigating that angle as well.",2016-02-29 18:13:52+00:00,d0iapw9,1.0,t3_48b1hm,5937.0,indianews

4506,"Excuse me, good sir. The 'fair vs dark arguement' ain't by me, but by certain pro-Dravida and pro-Dalit factions who believe Dravidas who were the 'natives' of this land (Harappa), and after being 'vanquished', were co-opted into society by the rampaging Aryans into 'BCs' which hence are darker while the Aryans placed themselves into 'FCs' which is why they're generally of fair complexion. Which is also why most mythical legends portray villains as dark while heroes are usually fair. And whenever a dark hero emerged, they were described 'blue' rather than 'dark' thus robbing the Dravidas of heroes. The idea that Aryans were sent as Brahmins to keep the Dravidas in check in Tamil Nadu, fits their narrative as most Tamil Brahmins are distinctly fairer than the 'average' Tamils. Also, they say some concessions seem to have been made by portraying some dark figures as divine, such as Kali Ma but then how acceptable is a blood-drinking fiery goddess to today's veggie-*sattvik* quasi-Brahminical Jainism-inspired Hindutvavaadis, is anybody's guess.

4511,"Whether BJP or Shiv Sena would survive without dynasties is mere speculation. It is just a battle of perceptions, and you obviously being a BJP supporter it is understandable that you'd say Shiv Sena has no future and BJP does. But it cannot be discounted that numerous dynastic rules across the nation contribute to make what today is BJP. 

Shiv Sena and BJP are mere organizations that represent ideological tendencies. Shiv Sena represents the rustic urban native and BJP, the suave sweet-talking Brahmin/Bania. Mumbai region is always in a post-riots state - history had repeated itself in the events of the 90s, the rustic urban natives did the same in the 90s what they had done for their suave, *sattvik* brethren a century earlier. 

Obituaries to the Sena have been written since the 90s. Only, instead of *p*seculars, the Brahmin-Banias are doing it this time around. But fact remains that where other parties got utterly decimated in the midst of a 'wave' riding anti-incumbency after the worst government independent India has ever suffered, the Sena held out it's own though it's star campaigner was not around. And emerged second largest party. And such was the might of public opinion, that BJP *had* to dispatch Swamy to send feelers for an alliance with Sena, after the NCP alliance-on-the-sly fiasco. Nobody is invincible or immortal, the BJP has faced a shock defeat in 2004. So thoroughly demoralized were they then that it took very long for them to again don the *Lauh Purush* personas they flaunt everywhere today.

Would you say the people of Andhra, TN, Mysore, Salem, WB, Rourkela, NOIDA, North East, South Odisha and horticulture farmers, the disabled, coolies, and mahants, sadhus and citizens of Ayodhya and Ram devotees have two dicks too as it is apparent they feel they were 'entitled' to railway perks and are disappointed on not getting those?!

Every leader when elected to office is expected to give back to his home region. When elevated to the rank of a Minister in Government, his duty is also to the nation as a whole. But that does not mean it is unethical to lay more emphasis on the very people who empowered him in the first place. Which is why, every leader from Atal Bihari Vajpayee to Modi conferred benefits on their home constituents. Now, this Suresh Prabhu is a loser on that front - he has earlier sacrificed Maharashtra's interests, and hence it was unfortunately only a matter of time that he rise to disappoint again.

&gt; “There is nothing new in the budget and Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu has simply attempted to push for the completion of the old projects. The Central Line is the main line and has the second highest number of passengers in the three lines and even with the deaths of Bhavesh Nakate in November last year and Dhanashri Godave in February this year, no additional train has been announced,” said Subhash Gupta, member of the Zonal Railway Users Consultative Committee.

&gt; He added that the passenger associations have long asked to bring down the frequency of the trains from five minutes to two minutes. The railway minister’s proposal included a mention of staggered timings for the government officials in Mumbai to ease the load on the railways stems from an old suggestion that the railway authorities had made to the Maharashtra government.

[Source: No new trains for Mumbai Central line, passengers disappointed](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/budget/no-new-trains-for-mumbai-central-line-passengers-disappointed/)

&gt; Speaking to Firstpost , an RTI activist Anil Galgali said, ""The railway minister, who hails from Mumbai has made a mockery of the sentiments of 84 lakh passengers belonging to his own city Mumbai. There are no new trains and the budget involves a repetition of the same routine. The lifeline is becoming a death line.""

[Source: Left high and dry? Suresh Prabhu's Rail Budget neglected his own state, say commuters, politicians](http://www.firstpost.com/india/left-high-and-dry-suresh-prabhus-rail-budget-neglected-his-own-state-say-commuters-politicians-2642900.html)

There's nothing *'Marathi manoos'* about Subhash Gupta or Anil Galgali - they are just citizens of Maharashtra and hence they expected the Rail Minister to do more for what is the financial capital of our nation.


If politics or selfish entitlement is all you see in criticism of a Minister of a Government you support, then your alleged nationalism is seriously flawed. Because, all these disappointed people - these non-Marathi Maharashtrians, South Odiyas, the mahants of Ayodhya, horticulture farmers - they are after all, *our* people.

But after the riots that followed in the then-Bombay city, the Sena had to face a barrage of scathing criticism, and the BJP dumped the Sena as a consequence! And approached them again after the storm died down! After the shock of 2004, there was an exodus of allies from the mammoth NDA, some of who are now singing paeans to Modi. The Sena even then had stood by BJP which was a period of utter despair for them. When Vajpayee was mulling removing Modi as CM of Gujarat after 2002, Sena opined if he was removed Gujarat will slip out of BJP's hands. When a pro-Hindutva Shankarsinh Vaghela was looking for an alternative to BJP, he approached Sena but got an unenthusiastic response. There was always an understanding between the two - *deshaat BhaJaP, pradeshat Sena* (BJP for the nation, Sena for the state). Which is why the Sena outside Maharashtra never nursed electoral ambitions - they functioned as just another Hindu organization. This also prevented division of the pro-Hindu vote. Ultimately, it is BJP who gained much more from the alliance - other Northern Indian-based parties like BSP, SP could never crack Maharashtra because they probably could never shake off the 'north Indian' tag.

While the deal may be good for the Japanese, we have to think from our point of view - will it benefit us.

You fail to factor in bias. If I post something critical of Sena, it reaches the top of the page with a gazillion angsty/edgy comments but if it's something genuinely praiseworthy, it rarely gets genuine appreciation. Also, their issues are those with which internet-savvy redditors cannot identify. For example, when I make a post detailing how there is national outrage when Maharashtra Government makes knowledge of Marathi mandatory for getting a taxi permit while a similar move in favor of Kannada in Karnataka went unnoticed, people find it uninteresting, nationalists might even find it going against the grain of unity of the nation! Same when I make a post on how there are quotas for locals in jobs across the nation, and Sena usually demands something similar. People don't like to acknowledge that. So the dice here is already loaded against the Sena.

4693,"&gt; Nah, he's been advocating it since he's been running for PM. He's acting on it now. He's been calling for respect to all professions as well.

If he were genuinely concerned about skill creation, was the Land Acquisition not a chance to create skilled workforce? But no, instead he chose to *remove* relevant parts and ram through a law that would have rendered farmers with only farming skills completely at the mercy of labor market forces, or government handouts if any.

&gt; Nah, people who are bitching aren't the farmers. They're mostly people who wanna put down everything the government does. As far as I've seen, they're not even talking about the Land Act. They just wanna write it off. I'm surprised I haven't come across jubilation's over the Make in India stage burning.

Of course, the Congress and their ideological allies will hate almost everything NDA does. But I am not willing to ignore a silver lining to the Girgaum fiasco. Forcing white lights on Marine Drive without consulting the public and bypassing local government, removing innocuous things like open air gyms, supporting segregation in housing in face of staunch opposition from *all* parties, forcing the entire city to observe vegetarianism on Paryushan, prioritizing bullet trains over deaths on tracks, appointing a Municipal Commissioner who refuses to meet democratically elected people's representatives, trying to bypass grassroots public workers by transferring power to a babu appointed from faraway Delhi.. Too much *Lauh Purush* thingy going on! The HC had detailed *why* such events should not be held at Chowpatty in 2011. The Court *now* too refused to let them do so. And still they went ahead. It is now emerging a lot of compromises were made on the safety and planning front. So while there's zeitgeist being created how government agencies and enterprises are a big liability to the nation and the private sector is super efficient and reliable, it is being sought to pin the blame on Wizcraft that was the event manager for the Girgaum show!


&gt; Nobody really cares about the farmers. It's as sad as it's true. The political class is for some reason blind to farmers' plight.

In the same vein then it can be conceded that for the party that puts tradespeople on a pedestal and prioritizes trade interests over everything else, and sells welfare of businesses as panacea for all the ills plaguing our nation, it is almost impossible to even begin to empathize with the plight of farmers. Who else can be so insensitive or ignorant, to say farmers commit suicide because they're impotent and cowards?!",2016-02-17 05:48:47+00:00,d02wr6e,5.0,t1_d027oox,38300.0,indianews

Hark back to what Raj Purohit had said in the sting video - *banias* don't want to pay tax, he clearly said. Now factor in, that almost all of top industry is owned by this community and it emerges on what scale evasion of taxes is happening in India.

Job creation could just turn out to be a mirage we end up chasing if we do not pay attention to the warning sounds about impending automation in industry. It'd be futile to expect business people to be nationalistic and avoid automation in their enterprises to provide jobs to laymen. One of the major arguments against Modi's proposed amendments to the Land Acquisition Act was that they were trying to do away with the social impact assessment, which in turn would have a skill creation aspect to it. If at all Modi is talking about skill creation *now*, it surely is in part due to the impression delivered during the Land Acquisition debates that the Centre wants to dispossess farmers of their livelihoods by taking away their lands and leaving them with not much in hand. People wouldn't have bitched about Make In India had Modi not tried to do away with labor welfare and at least pretended to care for non-business sections of the Indian populace.

4769,"At least some smart Hindus have learned it - a few years ago, Kannada organizations urged the Karnataka CM to move some industries to Belgaum so that 'thousands of Kannadigas could be settled there', to dilute the strength of Marathis in case the Supreme Court orders a plebiscite or head count. Soon enough, the state government announced a plan for industrialization and also made Belgaum the second capital of the state.

Meanwhile the Marathis elected a Hindu nationalistic party to power that is utterly blind to struggles *within* the larger Hindu community. Said nationalistic party at Centre and State proceeded to allow a change in name of the district from Marathi to Kannada, a move which even the wretched Congress did not undertake though it had governments in both states as well as the Centre. 

Hindu nationalistic party also appointed a prominent Kolhapur MLA as 'pointsman' for Belgaum issues from Maharashtra's side. What happened? Kolhapur district administration practically banned a Marathi movie depicting Yellur police atrocities on locals.

Hindu nationalistic party that puts India First also supports segregation in housing on the basis of dietary preferences in space-starved Mumbai. This is especially notable as this comes on the background of a longstanding history of attempts to appropriate the city who were first the business allies of our British overlords, and now are said to finance Hindu nationalistic party. This party has been going about making schemes under the guise of redevelopment, to mass relocate meat-eating Hindus to outside city limits (nationalists on reddit term it 'gentrification').

4807,"Here are three links that show parents that are financially not well-off are worse at rearing kids:

&gt; [Research has shown that children of poorer parents display substantially worse math and reading skills by the time they start grade school. Other studies have revealed that these wide gaps in pre-school skills persist into adulthood and help explain low educational attainment and lifetime earnings.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/04/28/the-real-reason-why-poor-kids-perform-worse-in-school-and-in-life/)

So whatever is proposed of gay men because they hypothetically cannot raise kids well (this has been refuted by now though) should be applicable to heterosexual poor people as well?

Still, due credit to you for stating that some gay people do bring up children well.

An extension of the logic that children do well only in families consisting of a male and female parent, is that single men/women should not be allowed to be parents, and that this is not sanctioned by Indian culture. But:

&gt; Rishi Kanva, for example, adopts an abandoned child that he finds in the forest and raises her as his own. She grows up to be Shakuntala who, when rejected by her husband, Dushyanta, raises her son, Bharata, on her own. The son becomes so great a king that the land he rules comes to be known as Bharata-varsha, now known as India.

&gt; The Upanishads tell the story of Satyakama who asks his mother, Jabala, about his father. She replies, ‘I don’t know. I had many men when I young servant.’ Depending on our political beliefs, we can say Jabala was an exploited female servant or a liberated young woman. Rishi Gautama accepts Jabala as his student as he finds the child truly unafraid of the truth.

&gt; The Puranas also tells the story of Kardama who has no desire to take responsibility of the household and so, with his wife’s permission goes into the forest. The wife, Devahuti, raises her son, Kapila, on her own. Kapila is the great scholar of Samkhya philosophy.

&gt; In the Ramayana, Sita raises her sons, Luv and Kusha, on her own in the forest, after she is kicked out by her husband Ram following street gossip. She does not go back to her father’s house. In the Mahabharata, after Pandu and Madri die, Kunti raises her own three sons and her two stepsons on her own and then returns to Hastinapur only to secure their inheritance. A lesser-known story tells us how Shantanu, separated from his wife Ganga and his son Devavrata, finds and adopts the twin children, Kripa and Kripi, abandoned children of Shardwana. He notices that they are placed on a deerskin and realises they are the children of a rishi, and so raises the children in the way of the rishis.

&gt; Parvati produces Ganesha on her own, without the help of a husband, as her husband, Shiva, is uninterested in family. So her son is called Vinayaka (vina = no, nayaka = man). Thus Parvati displays her autonomy.
Ganesha is also called dvi-mata, having two mothers. And Ganesha’s brother, Kartikeya, is raised by many ‘mothers’ which includes male gods, the fire-god Agni and the wind-god Vayu, as well as a whole bunch of goddesses, like the river-goddess Ganga, the mountain-goddess Parvati, the goddess of the forest of reeds Shara-vana, and the star-goddesses Krittikas. The father, Shiva, is conspicuous by his absence. Talk about unconventional families.

4808,"1] We need to admit the fact that homosexuality is a natural variant of human behavior. But then is it a disease? Here: 

&gt; The social, medical and legal approach to homosexuality ultimately led for its inclusion in the first and second publications of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). This served to conceptualize homosexuality as a mental disorder and further stigmatize homosexuality in society. However, the evolution in scientific study and empirical data from Kinsey, Evelyn Hooker and others confronted these beliefs, and by the 1970s psychiatrists and psychologists were radically altering their views on homosexuality. Tests such as the Rorschach, Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) and the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) indicated that **homosexual men and women were not distinguishable from heterosexual men and women in functioning**. These studies failed to support the previous assumptions that family dynamics, trauma and gender identity were factors in the development of sexual orientation. In light of the overwhelming data, as well as changing social norms, the Board of Directors for the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality as a mental disorder from the DSM in 1973.

[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality_and_psychology#The_Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual)

2] If homosexual behavior should be called 'deviant', because their behavior 'deviates' from ['normal'](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/normal), should behavior of people who choose to remain celibate (like '*brahmachaaris*'), or abandon their wives (partners with who they are supposed to procreate), also be labeled 'deviant'? We would then be preparing ground for labeling some of our national figures as 'deviants'.

3] If the inherent limitation of homosexuals that they cannot procreate by themselves (without the aid of scientific intervention) were to be deemed an important parameter to justify labeling them 'deviant' or 'unnatural' or 'abnormal', what of the countless infertile heterosexual couples who are not able to bear children years after marriage and copulation?

4] Any groundbreaking change in social and legal norms will involve efforts by us to accommodate. For example when co-ed schools were started in conservative India, surely there might have been 'concerns' how sexual tension will preclude serious pursuit of academic activities in such places of learning? Or how abandonment of '*purdah*' would have constrained the freedom of men to navigate through public places without being aroused by women indulging in relative exhibitionism?

5] 'Easy intimacy' between boys will continue to persist among boys who are confident about their heterosexual orientation. Only those with a deep fear of getting seduced by someone of the same sex will be wary of it ('repressed'). Also, this is a cultural thing. In the metros, you will see more boys and girls in groups casually touching each other than in the villages of India; intimacy does not need to be only among sexual partners.",2016-02-08 21:55:56+00:00,czspmel,3.0,t1_czse0v9,16134.0,indianews

&gt; “Lodha never had so much money. Pramod Mahajan made him wealthy,” Purohit purportedly says. Lodha is known to have been close to Mahajan while Purohit, for three decades, was seen as close to the late Gopinath Munde.

&gt; “Lodha has a major say in the party as he is the funds provider. Ideally, I should have been the most senior minister after Eknath Khadse, but I am not even a minister. It is because Lodha ensures my name does not figure in list. It is manipulated at the top.”

&gt; The normally reticent Lodha hit back immediately, issuing a statement against Purohit. “The utterances and allegations are an indication of the political failure and frustration of Purohit,” reads his one-page statement. “I have been in politics for 35 years and my credentials are well-known in the party. **Is it a crime to be a developer? I have always adopted fair practices in business as well as politics**.”

'शिवसेना आणि मा.शिवसेनाप्रमुख' या विषयावर व्याख्यान देताना मी आवर्जून एक गोष्ट सांगतो. कुठेही मदतीची गरज भासली की सैन्यानंतर तत्काळ पुढे येणारे हात हे केवळ स्वयंसेवक आणि शिवसैनिकांचेच. हा त्याचा प्रत्यक्ष प्रत्यय. केवळ बघ्याची भूमिका न घेता; आपल्या प्राणाची बाजी लावण्याची जिगर ही शिवसैनिकाकडेच असते. रमेशजींनी वाचवलेल्या तरुणींची नावे अंजुम खान आणि कस्तुरी वासिम अली खान अशी आहेत. 

&gt; शिवसैनिक हे अजब रसायन आहे. कोणीही 'न मागता' मदत करणे हे त्यांचे वैशिष्ट्य आहे. त्यामुळेच कोणीही कितीही गळे काढून त्यांना 'गुंड' म्हणो; आपल्या विभागात असलेली शिवसेना शाखा ही सामान्य लोकांना कायम दिलासा देणारी असते. 'शिवसैनिक' म्हणजे 'चांगला माणूस' हे समीकरण जनमानसात रूढ आहे. त्याकरता रमेश वळंजूंसारखे शिवसैनिक थोडीथोडकी नव्हे; गेली पन्नास वर्ष झटत आहेत. सतत शिव्या देण्यापेक्षा आणि खिल्ली उडवण्यापेक्षा जमलंच तर कधीतरी असे प्रसंगदेखील लक्षात ठेवा. रमेशजी....दंडवत.

&gt; In January 2015, NGT had given the BMC orders to de-concretise around all trees but still nothing has been done around many trees in the area.


This is no small project, with a lot of pulls and pressures on the Corporation:

&gt; On September 9, in an affidavit submitted to the NGT, JV Pardeshi, superintendent of garden, had stated that the BMC had identified 19 lakh trees in the city that required de-concretisation of their bases. He claimed that the BMC has been able to complete the de-concretisation of 11,790 trees across 24 wards. However, he also said that since the work requires huge manpower it would take over three months to be completed, which was the time frame set by the NGT.

Solutions often end up creating new problems if citizens do not cooperate:

&gt; However, this has given rise to a new problem. People are now using the space created around trees after this de-concretisation to dump garbage. “Ward officers may request secretaries of housing societies to keep such places clean, ensuring there is no dumping of any garbage or leftover tiles after removal of concrete around the tree,” said the NGT.

&gt; This tree is huge. I've seen it myself for the last 30 years, but I'm certain it's been there for much longer. Since the last year or so, the tree has lost all its leaves and now lies dead, waiting to be cut down.


&gt; The next step is removing the bark of the trees which further increases the chances of it dying. Not sure why this is done, but it's been done on tens of trees and almost all of them are cut down in a few months.

&gt; 1) **Biological measures** –

&gt; In order to control mealy bug use of predator insects like Australian lady bird beetle (Cryptolemus montezuari) which directly feeds on mealybugs.

&gt; Dusting or spraying of Biopesticide containing Parasite fungus Metarizium Verticilium Lecani,which creates disease on mealybug &amp; feeds on it.

&gt; 2) **Chemical measures** – 

&gt; Applying systemic pesticide in granular form at root zone leavel viz. Fertera or Regent which is absorbed by roots and reaches to leaves attacking insect pest from inside.

&gt; 3) **Mechanical measures** –

&gt; a) Heavy trimming of infected branches and destroying them.

&gt; b) Applying neem leaves pulp or neem oil around tree trunk and tree basin which acts as repellent to pest avoiding further attack and transmission. The garden department staff from each ward started these IPM techniques to save the raintrees from mealybug attack. Around 3000 Australian lady bird beetles received from Bio control lab Pune and 2500 beetles received from NBAII, Bangalore total 5500 beetles were released on infested rain trees in Mumbai city. Biopesticide fungal powder was dusted and sprayed on rain trees. Systemic insecticide Regent granules were mixed to root zone soil around trees, heavy trimming was done to destroy infested branches.

&gt; Almost a dozen trees on this one road have been cut down in the last week and many of them are still lying around like this, waiting to be picked up.

&gt; There is an organisation of women, who, along with the BMC have taken up painting these dead trees. Their intentions are good, and they do want to send the right message, but personally, I'd much rather see another tree being planted there than have see a shiny dead one each day.

There's going to be new trees soon:

Still, suspicions of deliberate killings of even healthy trees by businesses don't seem to be unfounded:

&gt; Tree lover Kshitij Ashtekar said, “Rain trees dying at an alarming rate is a clear indicator that multiple things are going wrong in Mumbai. While the BMC has pinned the blame (for the death of the trees) solely on the mealy bugs, I tried to explain to its officials with the help of data, maps, and facts that this isn’t the case.

&gt; Rain trees falling prey to mealy bugs is the secondary symptom. With the help of data collated through surveys and mapping, I can confidently say that heavy concretisation around trees, continuous digging by utility companies, pollution caused by traffic jams are some of the reasons.

&gt; Also, pollution has resulted in death of controller insects like the ladybird beetle, parasitic wasp and praying mantis, among others. This has upset the natural balance between the mealy bugs and their predators.”Ashtekar added that those with vested interests are also deliberately killing the trees.

&gt; “We have examples wherein trees have been chopped for clearing views for large hoardings, making easy entrances for shopping malls, creating parking spaces for parking lots and builders. Once, I had personally visited Bangur Nagar police station, Malad (West), to file complaints against miscreants for injecting a healthy tree with lethal chemicals. The said tree now stands dead near the Kachpada bus stop.”

4873,"**PART 1**

&gt; The BMC is claiming that the trees are dying in large numbers all over Mumbai from a mealybug infestation. 

&gt; I'm not sure what it is but we're losing 100s of once-healthy trees, some more than 50 years old.

Here:

&gt; Mealybugs are sexually dimorphic: females appear as nymphs, exhibiting reduced morphology, and lack wings, although unlike many female scale insects, they often retain legs and can move. Males are smaller, gnat-like and have wings. Since mealybugs (as well as all other Hemiptera) are hemimetabolous insects, they do not undergo complete metamorphosis in the true sense of the word. However, male mealybugs do exhibit a radical change during their life cycle, changing from wingless, ovoid nymphs to wasp-like flying adults.

&gt; Mealybug females feed on plant sap, normally in roots or other crevices, and in a few cases the bottoms of stored fruit. They attach themselves to the plant and secrete a powdery wax layer (hence the name mealybug) used for protection while they suck the plant juices. In Asia, mango mealybug is considered a major menace for the mango crop. The males on the other hand are short-lived as they do not feed at all as adults and only live to fertilize the females. Male citrus mealy bugs fly to the females and resemble fluffy gnats.

&gt; Some species of mealybug lay their eggs in the same waxy layer used for protection in quantities of 50–100; other species are born directly from the female.

&gt; The most serious pests are mealybugs that feed on citrus; other species damage sugarcane, grapes, pineapple (Jahn et al. 2003), coffee trees, cassava, ferns, cacti, gardenias, papaya, mulberry, sunflower and orchids. Mealybugs only tend to be serious pests in the presence of ants because the ants protect them from predators and parasites. Mealybugs also infest some species of carnivorous plant such as Sarracenia (pitcher plants); in such cases it is difficult to eradicate them without repeated applications of insecticide such as diazinon. Small infestations may not inflict significant damage. In larger amounts though, they can induce leaf drop.

&gt; Fossil specimens of Acropyga genus ants have been recovered from the Burdigalian stage Dominican amber deposits and several individuals are preserved carrying the extinct mealybug genus Electromyrmococcus.[3] These fossils represent the oldest recorded record of the symbiosis between mealybugs and Acropyga species ants



[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mealybug#Description)


&gt; Most mealybug species lay eggs. However, the long-tailed mealybug gives birth to live young, while the citrus &amp; vine mealybug produce quantities of ""waxy wool"" in which they can lay up to 500 eggs.Egg laying may take up to 10 days and reduces the size of the female mealybug considerably. The female dies once she has completed laying her eggs. Once hatched the young, or ""crawlers"" as they are sometimes called, are very mobile. They disperse rapidly and find suitable sites on which they feed and settle. The females continue to feed until they are mature enough to lay eggs.The complete life cycle takes approximately 50 days at 20ºC (68ºF), this is reduced to 25 days at 30ºC, higher temperatures may inhibit egg laying.


&gt; Mealybugs are often found in clusters on stems and leaf whorls. They produce honeydew like secreation which often leads to sooty mould growth. Large colonies can weaken the plant because of the amount of sap being sucked which can result in yellowing leaves &amp; defoliation.


&gt; Mealybugs can build up in huge numbers in a very short time and cause considerable damage. They feed by inserting their straw-like mouthparts, known as ‘stylets’, into plant tissue. Feeding damage can be either by direct removal of plant fluids and nutrients, and/or by the excretion of toxic salivary compounds into plant tissue. The waste product of the mealy bug feeding process - is a perfect growth medium for sooty mould fungi. These moulds/fungus damage plants by covering leaves and reducing light available for photosynthesis resulting the death of plants.

&gt; **Symbiotic (Friendly) Relationship of Ants and Mealy Bugs**:

&gt; Various species of ants ‘farm’ mealybugs in much the same way that humans farm cows. In return for honeydew like excreata, the mealybugs are given shelter in the form of ‘shelters/ protection from any intruders. Most species of ants that ‘farm’ mealybugs also aggressively defend their ‘herds’ from predators and parasites. Ants ‘milk’ the mealybugs - when they stroke a mealybug’s abdomen it responds by exuding a drop of honeydew like secretion.

&gt; **Natural enemy of Mealy bugs**:

&gt; Mealybug Ladybird (Cryptolaemus montrouzieri) acts as a natural enemy for mealy bird.

&gt; The predatory beetle, Cryptolaemus montrouzieri (Mealybug Ladybird) of the Coccinellidae family is a general predator of mealybugs. Native of Australia and introduced into several countries such as India, New Zealand, UK, Italy, Spain, Greece, Hawaii, Brazil, Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, USA, Bermuda, Israel, Indonesia, Philippines, Hong Kong, China, Egypt, South Africa, Trinidad, Grenada, Guyana, St. Kitts, and St. Lucia.

.


&gt; Ever since the roads were concretised in the late 90s, the trees have lost all breathing space. They're surrounded in concrete right up to the trunk. 

That's one of the reasons why trees' immunity to mealybugs has gone down.


&gt; Mealybug species seems to be introduced from outside Mumbai city area or from other state through transport of various plant saplings from other states by various Private &amp; Government agencies, private nurseries, Institutes &amp; citizens. Mealybug species got favourable
environment with huge number of host Raintrees without any natural enemy,predator or parasite present in Mumbai city. Raintree was the only single host plant attacked by mealybugs, no other host plant was available in the city, hence only Raintree has to suffer the attack. Monotonus plantation of single tree species, Raintree, in a continuous line along long roads with their branches touching each other &amp; cables hanging continuously over the trees helped transmission of pest very rapidly from one tree to another, infesting all trees on continuous road within short time period. 

&gt; Use of same tree trimming/cutting tools for all trees one after other, infested as well as healthy trees may had also added fast transmission of infestation. These mealy bugs produce white wooly cover on the body &amp; secrets honeydew like sticky substance which protects them from predators &amp; also makes pesticide spray ineffective. Ants protect these mealy bugs from natural enemies as they harvest honeydew from the pest. Excess use of chemical pesticides in Agricultural field pest has become resistant to pesticides
not responding to insecticidal spray thereby increasing pest population enormously spreading across the districts &amp; states &amp; now reached in Mumbai city.

&gt; Botanists and horticulturists attribute it to a combination of factors — including concretisation, changing climate and higher temperatures.

&gt; “There is just one previous instance of mealybug infestation in rain trees in the city, in the mid-1990s. It wasn’t severe and the rains that year washed out the bugs,” says horticulturist VK Ogale, former head of the Molecular Biology and Agriculture Division at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre. “This time it’s quite serious. Unusually high temperatures after the rainy season revived the bugs. What’s worse, the bugs are preying on a rain tree population whose immunity has already been weakened, and the bugs are thriving.”

&gt; The trees’ immunity has been reduced over five to seven years by the concretisation of the areas around them, particularly their drip areas — the space directly beneath the canopy.

&gt; “Normally, water drips to the ground from the canopy and is taken in as food and nutrition by the tree’s roots. With the soil under these large tree replaced by layers of cement, tar, or paver blocks, the roots are not getting enough water and air. This hinders photosynthesis and weakens the tree,” says Ogale.

&gt; It was concerned residents and environmentalists that first raised the alarm about the shrivelling of their once-lush rain trees.

&gt; In 2010, the first instances were reported in Kandivli. “We then though it was a mild infestation,” said an official from the BMC garden’s department, speaking on condition of anonymity. By September 2013, when a healthy monsoon failed to wash away the bugs and many trees were found shrivelled and dead in the city, Vanashakti tied up with Jhunjhunwala college to study the issue and try to find a way to save the trees.

&gt; “We geotagged and studied 1,700 rain trees across the city and found that rain trees in gardens and areas with enough soil were unaffected by the mealybugs because they were healthy and able to fight the infestation,” says Stalin. Think of it like the recent cases of dengue, adds Ogale of the BARC. “Not everyone living in an area with dengue-carrying mosquitoes will suffer from the disease. It is the ones with weak immunity that will. It’s the same with the rain trees and mealybugs,” Ogale says.

&gt; In some cases, the mealybugs are also feasting on old trees that are weak because they are at the end of their life cycle, adds Avinash Kubal, an expert in forestry and deputy director of the Maharashtra Nature Park.

&gt; “However, the concretisation is quickening their death and allowing mealybugs to take root in the weakened, aged trees,” Kubal adds.

4925,"This has been India's position since long:


&gt; Tim Gore, Oxfam's international climate policy adviser, has sent me his thoughts:

&gt; *The irony of the situation is that rich countries are in their position of wealth because of the role they have played in exacerbating climate change. We have enjoyed the fruits of carbon intensive industrialisation while it is the world's poorest who are disproportionately affected.*

&gt; *It is also because of this that rich countries are best placed to help. However, at a time of austerity, it is important to recognise that there are smart, innovative ways of raising the funding needed so that poor countries can adapt to the gathering pace of climate change and develop in a low carbon way. Charging for shipping emissions and a Robin Hood tax are both ways of generating the money desperately needed without turning yet again to the tax payer.*

&gt; *Climate change will affect us all in a warming planet and we can all play a part in tackling the problem, but it is rich countries who have the responsibility and are best positioned to lead us all to a safer future.*

[Source: Doha climate talks: should rich countries shoulder 'responsibility' for carbon cuts? The UN's Ban Ki-moon says rich countries should bear most of the responsibility for climate change.](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/dec/06/climate-change-rich-countries-doha)

&gt; **India**:

&gt; Rejects legally binding target, but wants rich countries legally bound

&gt; Says rich countries are to blame for climate change and points to big gap in per capita emissions

&gt; Wants 40% cut in rich country emissions by 2020

[Source: Where countries stand on Copenhagen](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8345343.stm)

&gt; The BASIC countries (also Basic countries or BASIC) are a bloc of four large newly industrialized countries – Brazil, South Africa, India and China– formed by an agreement on 28 November 2009. The four committed to act jointly at theCopenhagen climate summit, including a possible united walk-out if their common minimum position was not met by the developed nations.

&gt; This emerging geopolitical alliance, initiated and led by China, then brokered the finalCopenhagen Accord with the United States. Subsequently, the grouping is working to define a common position on emission reductions and climate aid money, and to try to convince other countries to sign up to the Copenhagen Accord. However, in January 2010, the grouping described the Accord as merely a political agreement and not legally binding, as is argued by the US and Europe.

&gt; The four countries also said they will announce their plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 31 January 2010 as agreed in Copenhagen. Furthermore, the grouping discussed the possibility of providing financial and technical aid to the poorer nations of the G77, and promised details after their Cape Town meeting in April 2010. This move was apparently intended to shame richer nations into increasing their funding for climate mitigation in poorer nations.

[Source: BASIC countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_countries)

&gt; Indian government has unveiled a national action plan to confront the threat posed by climate change.

&gt; Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said the plan envisaged a gradual shift to greater reliance on sustainable sources of energy.

&gt; Mr Singh said the development of India's capacity to tap solar power would be central to the strategy.

&gt; But the prime minister made no commitment to cut his country's carbon emissions which are predicted to rise.

[Source: India unveils climate change plan](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7481259.stm)

&gt; How much does India contribute to global warming? And what role should India play in solving the problem? As climate change talks go down to the wire in Copenhagen, India is among the leaders among developing countries arguing that the U.S. and other wealthy countries should take the lead in paying to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. See, for instance, this Bloomberg News story on India’s top envoy in Copenhagen, environment minister Jairam Ramesh. “Because India has contributed little in the past to emissions blamed for global warming, Ramesh remains an unyielding figure at talks among 193 nations struggling to agree on ways to fight climate change,” Bloomberg News reporters Gaurav Singh and Jim Efstathiou Jr. write. “India endorses a proposal to limit the increase in global temperatures to within 2 degrees Celsius (3.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of pre-industrial times. The burden of meeting the target should fall on the U.S. and Europe, countries that have contributed most to historical carbon-dioxide emissions.”

- When first asked about the Aamir Khan episode, Pawar dismissed it saying 'why bother about Aamir Khan, what matters is the issue of martyred Col. Mahadik and his family'. Within 12 hours, Pawar declared those opposing Aamir Khan are 'intolerant'. If an actor adored by the nation starts spouting hatred for his very country, then the only thing more outrageous than that is, someone as senior and experienced in public life as Pawar backing such statements.

- By Pawar's logic, was the hatred Afzal Khan had for Shivaji merely his personal opinion? If Shaistekhan's fingers were cut off, then wouldn't that too would be termed 'intolerance' by those standards?

- It is not surprising that the head of a political party that termed a LeT operative like Ishrat Jahan a *santsajjan* would have a soft spot for deserters like Aamir Khan.

- Pawar said the nation is not owned by anyone, he is right. But when Aamir has earned whatever he has in this very nation and yet if Pawar agrees with him then maybe Pawar should confer Aamir with 'Nishaan-e-Baramati'.

- The likes of Mulayam, Rahul and Pawar are merely trying to gain traction within the Muslim community whereas the Muslim community itself doesn't seem to agree with these anti-India notions. Even someone associated with the likes of MIM, Asaduddin Owaisi has said that Hindusthan is my nation and we will stay here. We are not Hindusthani by birth, but also by choice he is reported to have said. On such background, the utterances of the likes of Pawar reek of tyranny and betrayal.

5084,"Problem is, they've become too proud to see reason and make necessary changes. Across ideologies and party affiliations, the narrative on the BJP is that the latter has become 'arrogant'. Little wonder then, that a strategically-timed statement on 'reassessment on the utility of reservations' is said to have inflicted quite some damage on BJP prospects in Bihar. But any attempt to urge course corrections is met with allegations of being anti-'this' and anti-'that'.. Looks like only successive defeats will now bring them back to their senses. 

As for Maharashtra, it was Bihar that forced a patch-up and another misadventure by BJP is just around the corner. No hopes of any permanent reconciliation till BJP drops their explicit aim of eliminating their allies from political spaces. One cannot threaten their allies with extinction and still expect unquestioning loyalty from them.

The Patidar issue was clearly mishandled by the State government, keeping in line with the way they made preemptive arrests of farmers who planned to protest at Vibrant Gujarat summits. Here:


&gt; Besides the reservation agitation, the BJP is also faced with the widespread dissatisfaction among the 6.5 lakh government employees recruited on fixed salary and contract basis. These employees, including police constables, forest guards, schoolteachers, auxiliary nurse, peons and drivers, have launched a state-wide agitation under the banner of the “Gujarat Against System” to highlight their exploitation by the BJP government by paying them a pittance of Rs 4,000 to 5,000 per month while taking from them the same, or even more work, than its regular employees.

&gt; The government employees, particularly the police, are equally unhappy with the government for “ruining” their Diwali holidays, the biggest annual festival in Gujarat, this year. If the elections were held as per the original schedule, it would have been over in October, but in its bid to postpone the elections because it was unnerved by the Patidar reservation agitation, the government has invited elections right in the middle of the festival season, cancelling holidays of most of the employees, and more so of the police deployed to maintain peace during the electioneering.

Incidentally, from the above source:

&gt; एक माँ के चार बेटे हैं। स्कूल-कालेज में जाने वाले बेटे को मालपुआ दूध में भिगोकर देती है। उस बेटे को मस्तिष्क का काम करना है इसलिए उसको दूध, घी, मक्खन, बादाम आदि जरूरी है। दूसरा बेटा हल चलाने खेत में जाता है। माँ उसके लिए मोटी रोटी बना देती है। साथ में अचार और प्याज रख देती है। गरम गरम लू चल रही है, अतः प्याज उसके लिए उत्तम है। तीसरे बच्चे ने जुलाब लिया है। उसके लिए पतनी खिचड़ी तैयार है। चौथा बच्चा सबसे छोटा है। उसका हाजमा बिल्कुल कमजोर है। माँ उसको मालुपुआ नहीं देती, रोटी और प्याज नहीं देती, पतली खिचड़ी भी नहीं देती। उसके लिए बकरी का हल्का दूध ही उत्तम है।

5142,"Very opinionated piece that also contains some facts.

&gt; The betrayal

Why not start from when BJP dumped the Shiv Sena after the latter was widely panned for the 1992 Bombay riots, despite that the Sena had stood by BJP in the aftermath of the Ayodhya demolition? Why not mention how BJP kept flirting with Pawar and MNS way before 2014?

&gt; Why does Uddhav want to harm the BJP?

Because since long the BJP, with it's stated aim of *shatpratishat BhaJaPa*, has made it clear it intends to edge out the Shiv Sena from all spheres of political power.

&gt; The Sena was one vote katwa or spoiler in the Bihar elections which received absolutely no attention whatsoever. 

Yeah, there were other *vote katuas* that were expected to help BJP - AIMIM and SP.

&gt; The Sena's Marathi chauvinism doesn't seem to have prevented it from making its presence felt in Bihar. 

Has BJP's vegetarian chauvinism prevented it from making forays in non-vegetarian lands?

&gt; It also finds it difficult to play second fiddle to a Brahmin from Nagpur like Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. The politics of Maharashtra has been dominated by non-Brahmins and the Western Maharashtra and Konkan regions. Fadnavis is an outsider on both counts.

The very core supporter base of the Shiv Sena in the Mumbai region is made up of a varied mix of Marathis originally from all corners of the state. Doesn't matter where you're from.

&gt; This explains why the Sena took on the BJP on the meat ban issue, which it saw as a Brahmin and Gujarati conspiracy.

Fadnavis had not much to do with the meat ban as did BJP corporators in local bodies. The Shiv Sena would have objected to the meat ban even if the CM was a non-Brahmin from say, Baramati.

&gt; Subramanian Swamy had said last year that the ideal polity would be one in which a soft Hindutva party and a hardline Hindutva party compete with each other.

Agreed. Seculars should be relegated to the corner. Maharashtra, for a short period of time last year had this - both the ruling party and the main opposition party were saffron!",2015-11-12 17:12:20+00:00,cwxuq2i,1.0,t3_3sjv24,1249.0,indianews

&gt; उन्होने उस बन्दर को हटने को कहा पर बन्दर ने मना कर दिया।

&gt; हनुमान क्रोधित हुए और बोले: ""तुम्हें पता है मैं कौन हूँ? मैं कुंति और पवन देवता का पुत्र भीम हूँ मेरे भाई का नाम हनुमान है, अभी भी कह रहा हूँ हट जा""।

&gt; ""मैं तो नहीं हटूंगा, अगर तुम्हें जा ना है तो मेरी पूंछ हटाओ और चले जाओ। वैसे यह हनुमान कौन है, क्या किया है उसने?""

&gt; तुम्हें हनुमान के बारे में नहीं पता जिसने समुद्र पार करके सीता माता को बचाया था? तुम बहुत  अज्ञानी हो।

&gt; यह कह कर भीम ने बन्दर की पूंछ हटाने की कोशिश की...

&gt; लेकिन कड़ी महनत के बाद भी भीम उस बन्दर कि पूंछ ज़रा सी भी नहीं हिला पाए।

&gt; वो पूरे पसीने में भीग गए थे जब उन्होने पूछा: ""मैं काफ़ी अपमानित हूँ। मुझे बताओ कि तुम कौन हो, तुम जीते और मैं हारा""।

&gt; ""भीम, मैं हनुमान हूँ, तुम्हारा भाई। वो फूल जिस तालाब के पास उगता है, उसका रास्ता मैं तुम्हें बता दूंगा। जब तुम युद्ध में लड़ोगे, तो एक शेर की तरह, तुम्हारी आवाज़ तुम्हारे शत्रुओं के दिल में भय पैदा कर देगी।"" यह कहकर हनुमान ने भीम को गले लगाया और भीम को शक्ति दे दी।

&gt; हनुमान चाहते थे कि भीम के अन्दर अहंकार ना आए ताकि वह युद्ध में अपनी पूरी शक्ति लगा कर विजयी हो सके।


&gt; **अभिप्राय :**


&gt; १. दृष्टान्तिक कथा: भीम पदाभिलाषी को दर्शाता है और हनुमान चुनौती और कठिनाइयों के प्रतीक हैं।

&gt; जब आदमी मुश्किलों का सामना करता है और नाकाम हो जाता है तो उसका घमंड टूट जाता है पर दृढ़ता और प्रयास में उसकी शक्ति बढ़ जाती है।


&gt; २.  गौरव और घमंड में बहुत कम अंतर होता है इसलिए हमें हमेशा कठोर अन्तरावलोकन से स्वयं को संयम में रखना चाहिए।

They are not historically authentic and give details of life in ancient India. These books can be seen as a logical binding of history and philosophy and arenot worth recommending to anyone who is looking to know more about India before the advent of Islam and who also wants to see Hinduism in positive light.

5250,"&gt; Different"" can take up multiple definitions.

Yes. But when you have defined the existing parameters, then 'difference' is just a matter of observation and comparison with the defined baseline.


&gt; We may also indefinitely keep on splitting hairs about the level of difference that exists between BJP and the rest of the lot. It would be pointless I must say.

Okay.


&gt; I disagree that only BJP has made 'being different' its USP. From where I stand, I see that most of the camps are claiming to at least offer something better (or different) than the rest. No exceptions. None of them is saying,

&gt; ""We are neither betterthan our competitors nor different in any waywhatsoever, but we would still like to be elected into power.""

&gt; I have not heard anyone say that in a long time, well, never actually.

I said BJP has projected their message of being different **in a manner no one else has**. This does **not** mean I implied no other party claims to be different. 

&gt; Please do not live inside a bubble of idealism, come outside to the real world.

&gt; It's filthy and stinky but it is what is real.


Yep, sure was living in a bubble when I used to support BJP. Realized it only later that the reality is not what I thought it was.

5295,"&gt; For the record, Fadnavis has said repeatedly, including in an exclusive interview to mid-day (‘Why didn’t they return awards when a scholar’s arm was cut off?’, October 30), that the BJP would have no issues in forging an alliance with the Sena in Mumbai.

It doesn't matter what BJP leaders state for the record, it is what they actually **do**, that's the real deal. The very same Fadnavis had repeatedly refused any prospective truck with the NCP - [*'we will prefer staying idle, out of power than form a coalition with NCP'*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D89G-IXpxk&amp;app=desktop) and still [went ahead and slept with the same people](http://www.mid-day.com/articles/bjp-mla-blurts-out-party-has-alliance-with-ncp-in-assembly/15771172) they vehemently denied having to do anything with!

BJP is quite infamous for making U-turns on their promises. Take the case of making Mumbai a global financial centre - Jayant Sinha of BJP [dangled the carrot](http://www.mid-day.com/articles/govt-keen-to-transform-mumbai-into-global-financial-hub-jayant-sinha/15971187) and Jaitley [took it away](http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/fm-chooses-gujarat-s-gift-city-over-mumbai-for-ifc-115022801035_1.html).

There are numerous such examples - BJP's promises for Gorkhaland followed by betrayal of that cause is another. Very recently, during the KDMC elections, BJP was faced with the prospect of having to include 27 traditionally Shiv Sena-supporting villages in the Municipal Corporation by way of a government notification which would have increased Sena's strength in the KDMC. First the state allowed it, then they backtracked. When the village communities threatened a unanimous boycott, BJP went ahead and assured them of a separate Municipality altogether! Now that BJP has emerged only as the second-largest party in KDMC, the 12 BJP corporators from those villages are going to be indispensable for BJP which is why it is anybody's guess if we are indeed going to see the promised Municipality materialize at all.

&gt; Balarama was a son of Vasudeva. The evil king Kansa, the brother of Devaki, was intent upon killing the children of his sister because of a prediction that he would die at the hands of her eighth son.


&gt; Vishnu then impregnated the belly of the goddess Devaki with two strands of hair, one black, one white. To ensure their safety, their essence was transferred before birth to Rohini, who also desired a child. At birth, Krishna had a darker complexion, while Balarama was born fair. The other name of Balarama is Sankarshana, meaning a spirit transferred between two wombs. According to Bhagavata Purana, the name Sankarshana means, ""one who brings together two different families"" of King Yadu's and King Nanda's dynasties

&gt; ‘मरने से ज़िंदा रहना श्रेष्ठ है’ – क्या विश्वामित्र का यह तत्त्व सर्वथा अपवाद–रहित कहा जा सकता है? नहीं! इस जगत में सिर्फ़ ज़िन्दा रहना ही कुछ पुरुषार्थ नहीं है। कौए भी काक–बलि खा कर कई वर्ष तक जीते रहते हैं। यही सोचकर वीरपत्नी विदुला अपने पुत्र से कहती है कि बिछौने पर पड़े–पड़े सड़ जाने या घर में सौ वर्ष की आयु को व्यर्थ व्यतीत करने की अपेक्षा, यदि तू एक क्षण भी अपने पराक्रम की ज्योति प्रगट करके मर जाएगा तो अच्छा होगा – **मुहूर्तं ज्वलितं श्रेयो न च धूमायितं चिरं**। यदि यह बात सच है कि आज नहीं तो कल, अंत में सौ वर्ष के बाद मरना ज़रूर है; तो फिर उसके लिए रोने या डरने से क्या लाभ है? आध्यात्मशास्त्र की दृष्टि से तो आत्मा नित्य और अमर है; इसलिए मृत्यु का विचार करते समय, सिर्फ़ इस शरीर का ही विचार करना बाकी रह जाता है। अच्छा; यह तो सब जानते हैं कि यह शरीर नाशवान है। परन्तु आत्मा के कल्याण के लिए इस जगत में जो कुछ करना है, उसका एकमात्र साधन यही नाशवान मनुष्य–देह है।

&gt; इसी लिए मनु ने कहा है कि **आत्मानं सततं रक्षेत् दारैरपि धनैरपि** – अर्थात; स्त्री और सम्पत्ति की अपेक्षा हमको पहले स्वयं अपनी ही रक्षा करनी चाहिए। यद्यपि मनुष्य–देह दुर्लभ और नाशवान भी है, तथापि जब उसका नाश करके उससे भी अधिक किसी शाश्वत वस्तु की प्राप्ति कर लेनी होती है (जैसे देश, धर्म और सत्य के लिए अपनी प्रतिज्ञा, व्रत और विरद की रक्षा के लिए एवं इज्ज़त, कीर्ति और सर्वभूत–हित के लिए) तब, ऐसे समय पर अनेक महात्माओं ने इस तीव्र कर्त्तव्याग्नि में आनन्द से अपने प्राणों की भी आहुति दे दी है। जब राजा दिलीप अपने गुरु वसिष्ठ की गाय की रक्षा करने के लिए, सिंह को अपने शरीर का बलिदान देने को तैयार हो गया, तब वह सिंह से बोला कि 'हमारे समान पुरुषों की इस पाञ्चभौतिक शरीर के विषय में अनावस्था रहती है, अतएव तू मेरे इस जड़ शरीर के बदले मेरे यश रूपी शरीर की ओर ध्यान दे'। कथासरित–सागर और नागानन्द नाटक में यह वर्णन है कि सर्पों की रक्षा करने के लिए जीमूतवाहन ने गरुड़ को स्वयं अपना शरीर अर्पण कर दिया। मृच्छकटिक नाटक में चारूदत्त कहता हैः–

&gt; &gt; **न भीतो मरणादस्मि केवलं दूषितं यशः।**

&gt; &gt; **विशुद्धस्य हि मे मृत्युः पुत्रजन्मसमः किलं।।**

&gt; 'मैं मृत्यु से नहीं डरता; मुझे यही दुःख है कि मेरी कीर्ति कलंकित हो गई। यदि कीर्ति शुद्ध रहे और मृत्यु भी आ जाए, तो मैं उसको पुत्र के उत्सव के समान मानूंगा।' इसी तत्त्व के आधार पर महाभारत में राजा शिबि और दधीचि ऋषि की कथाओं का वर्णन किया है। जब धर्मराज श्येन पक्षी का रूप धारण करके, कपोत के पीछे उड़े और जब वह कपोत अपनी रक्षा के लिए राजा शिबि की शरण में गया तब राजा ने स्वयं अपने शरीर का मांस काटकर उस श्येन पक्षी को दे दिया और शरणागत कपोत की रक्षा की। वृत्तासुर नाम का देवताओं का एक शत्रु था। उसको मारने के लिए दधीचि ऋषि की हड्डियों के वज्र की आवश्यकता हुई। तब सब देवता मिलकर उक्त ऋषि के पास गए और बोले शरीरत्यागं लोकहितार्थ भवान् कर्तुमर्हति – हे महाराज! लोगों के कल्याण के लिए आप देह का त्याग कीजिए। यह विनती सुन दधीचि ऋषि ने बड़े आनन्द से अपना शरीर त्याग दिया और अपनी हड्डियाँ देवताओं को दे दीं।

&gt; एक समय की बात है कि इन्द्र, ब्राह्मण का रूप धारण करके दानशूर कर्ण के पास कवच और कुण्डल मांगने आए। कर्ण इन कवच–कुण्डलों को पहने हुए ही जन्मा था। जब सूर्य ने जाना कि इन्द्र कवच–कुण्डल मांगने जा रहा है, तब उसने पहले ही से कर्ण को सूचना दे दी थी कि तुम अपने कवच–कुण्डल किसी को दान मत देना। यह सूचना देते समय सूर्य ने कर्ण से कहा कि 'इसमें संदेह नहीं है कि तू बड़ा दानी है, परन्तु यदि तू अपने कवच–कुण्डल दान में दे देगा तो तेरे जीवन ही की हानि हो जाएगी। इसलिए तू इन्हें किसी को न देना। मर जाने पर कीर्ति का क्या उपयोग है? – **मृतस्य कीर्त्या किं कार्यम्**। यह सुनकर कर्ण ने स्पष्ट उत्तर दिया कि **जीवितेनापि मे रक्ष्या कीर्तिस्तद्विद्धि मे व्रतम्** – अर्थात; जान चली जाए तो भी कुछ परवाह नहीं। परन्तु अपनी कीर्ति की रक्षा करना ही मेरा व्रत है। सारांश यह है कि 'यदि मर जाएगा तो स्वर्ग की प्राप्ति होगी और जीत जाएगा तो पृथ्वी का राज्य मिलेगा' इत्यादि क्षात्र–धर्म और **'स्वधर्मे निधनं श्रेयः'** यह सिद्धांत उक्त तत्त्व पर ही अवलंबित है। इसी तत्त्व के अनुसार श्री समर्थ रामदास स्वामी कहते हैं 'कीर्ति की ओर देखने से सुख नहीं है और सुख की ओर देखने से कीर्ति नहीं मिलती; और वे उपदेश भी करते हैं कि 'हे सज्जन मन! ऐसा काम करो जिससे मरने पर कीर्ति बनी रहे।'

&gt; From there they sailed for Hindustan, the northern territories of the Indian subcontinent. They landed on the Island of Div, in southern Saurashtra, where they stayed for another 19 years. From Div, they sailed along the coast, weathered a severe storm at sea, and finally landed in Gujarat. Some accounts state that about 18,000 Parsis came in seven junks, five of them landing in Div, one at Variav near Surat and one at Cambay in Gujarat.

&gt; There, they approached the local Hindu king, Jadi Rana, and requested asylum. The ruler, fearing for his kingdom, asked them to explain their beliefs, and made four other stipulations for granting asylum:

&gt; &gt; they were to adopt the local language (Gujarati)

&gt; &gt; their women were to wear the garments of the local women (the Sari)
    
&gt; &gt; they were to cease to carry weapons
    
&gt; &gt; marriages were only to be performed in the evenings (as the Hindus do)

&gt; The refugees, accepting the demands, expounded on the teachings of their faith, and ""when the Hindu Raja heard the oration, his mind regained perfect ease."" 

Also, [""like sugar in milk""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jadi_Rana#.22Like_sugar_in_milk.22):

&gt; One interesting, perhaps apocryphal Parsi legend relates the course of the initial meeting between Jadi Rana and the newly landed emigrants: When the Zoroastrians requested asylum, Jadi Rana motioned to a vessel of milk filled to the very brim to signify that his kingdom was already full and could not accept refugees. In response, one of the Zoroastrian priests added a pinch of sugar to the milk, thus indicating that they would not bring the vessel to overflowing and indeed make the lives of the citizens sweeter. Jadi Rana gave shelter to the emigrants and permitted them to practice their religion and traditions freely.

5355,"&gt; The Bombay of those days had its own underworld jurisdictions, with the south of the city handled by the Pathans and the Karim Lalas and the newly emerging Dawood Ibrahim gang, while the northern suburbs had their own godfathers for pockets of migrant populations.

&gt; “The weapons were different too. Tabhi ghoda nahin tha (Guns weren’t used then). It was tube lights, soda bottles and choppers,” says an old associate of Rajan.

&gt; The pockets in the central suburbs, which had a huge south Indian population, had Vardarajan Mudaliar. By the late seventies, with Mudaliar escaping to Tamil Nadu after facing the heat of the Mumbai police, the two Rajans moved in to take over that space. They had learnt from Mudaliar’s ways that bootlegging from illicit liquor dens was the most lucrative business. As rivalries grew, so did attacks on the street.

&gt; Yashwant Jadhav and Philip Phandare of Pestom Sagar, an elite pocket in Ghatkopar East that neighbours Tilak Nagar, were the immediate rivals of the Rajans. “Those days, Bada Rajan and Yashwant Jadhav fought pitched gang wars. Those were the most unsafe times for the residents of Tilak Nagar. Even during the 1992-93 riots, things weren’t that bad,” recalls a 65-year-old retired mill worker who doesn’t want to be quoted.

&gt; Senior BJP leader Eknath Khadse had criticized the police department at a meeting in Jalgaon on Monday.

&gt; On Tuesday, Chandrakant Patil, state PWD and cooperation minister and guardian minister of Kolhapur and Sangli, also targeted the police department for focusing more on 'settlement' than completion of investigations.

&gt; Speaking at a function in connection with the police training programme in Turchi in Sangli district, Patil said, ""The police are involved in settling the cases than undertaking thorough investigation till it reaches to the level of conviction of the accused. Out of 100 criminal cases, the accused walks freely in 90. Hence, the pressure of police is no longer felt in the state.""

&gt; In several cases, the police do not use all the articles of the Indian Penal Code while framing the charges. It helps the accused walk freely, he added. Patil is one of the senior leaders in the state cabinet and considered to be close to party national president Amit Shah. His jibe at the police would reflect on the state home ministry as well, which is currently under Fadnavis.

&gt; At a government officials' meeting in Jalgaon, revenue and agriculture minister Eknath Khadse had said that cases of dacoity and looting are on the rise in the district. Criminals are easily escaping from prisons as well, which points finger at the law and order situation in the state.

5366,"Nalapat has often had some interesting opinions:


&gt; Most countries, in common with individuals, use the past as the benchmark to evaluate the present. This leads to the formulation of policy that has no potency in an environment that has changed dramatically. A case in point is the ""anti-foreigner"" campaign, that every once in a while erupts into demonstrations against soft drinks or chicken outlets. These are based on the same feelings of inferiority that German skinheads have when 
they attack immigrants who are more accomplished than they themselves can ever hope to be. India’s skinheads are a useful ally to agencies such as Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence, which share with them the common goal of preventing foreign investment in India. 


&gt; Stalin once characterised Social Democracy and Nazism as ""Twins, not Antipodes"". In the process, he made the German communists take on the moderates with an equal or greater virulence than that shown to Hitler”s followers. Partly as a consequence, the Nazis came to power in 1933. Very soon, they showed how different they were from the Social Democrats, by destroying the structures of the Communist Party in Germany. 

&gt; By equating the foreign businessman with the security analyst who seeks to lock India into permanent inferiority, many ""nationalist” elements are in effect playing a supporting role to those groups that seek to restrict India to its current marginal role.

.


&gt; Those who were complacent about the ""impossibility"" of India ever following the Pakistan example need to redo their sums in the face of current developments. Those who bandish the trishul and burn Christian churches, or those who condemn Muslims, are playing the precise game of religious polarization that Jinnah intended for the subcontinent. Hindutva has become the ally of the ISI. It needs to be replaced by Indutva.

.


&gt; Another example of suicidal policies is in education. The country has the brain power to man dozens of technical institutes, that can attract students from all over the world. If just 25% of the seats in each such institution can be reserved for overseas students (at international market rates), then 50% can be occupied by Indian students who would pay much lower fees. 25% can be reserved for the economically underprivileged, who would pay no fees. In this manner, overseas students will subsidize the education of locals. However,  a move that would certainly have delighted the hundreds of foreign institutions that are earning millions through Indian students, the proportion of foreign students eligible for admission in Indian institutions has been reduced further from an already low 15% granted by the Supreme Court.  

.



&gt; Unlike other countries, that lobby to shoehorn their nationals into key slots in international bodies, the bureaucracy in India routinely shoots down requests for even elected representatives to travel abroad to attend conferences or discussions. As a result, decisions that impact on Indian interests get taken in absentia. In particular, those from the ""higher"" central administrative services work to reserve such slots for themselves rather than be given to professional experts and members of the armed forces. Clearly, the dominance of caste as a concept is still prevalent while taking decisions in India. Sadly, many of the backers of ""Hindutva"" see Christians or Muslims as the gravest threat to Hindu society, when in fact the maximum harm has come from the artificial creation of barriers between one believer and the other. Unless such pernicious practices are eliminated, Hindus will continue to drift away from the religion, however many missionaries and their children/get burnt by alleged practitioners of a religion that venerates tolerance and non-violence. 


.



&gt; In fact, India for example needs to build upon the few benefits of colonial rule, the primary among which was the spread of the international link language, English. Rather than restrict knowledge of this language to the economic elite, efforts need to be made to spread it lower down, so that manpower in this country can access markets where the knowledge of an international language is essential. By not following through the actual effects of the policies that get introduced in the name of the poor, successive governments in India have created structures that inhibit rather than promote upward mobility. An example is education in English. Many state governments have given low emphasis to education in the international link language, thus giving a severe handicap to those unable to afford private education.


.


&gt; Only during the Chidambaram years were taxes cut to sensible levels, although Yashwant Sinha - clearly to help his former brothers in the civil service - has been trying to raise them again. If the economy is showing robustness despite wars and mismanagement, the credit should go to the Chettiar from Tamil Nadu who gave Indians a fair deal for the first time in a millennium. Manmohan Singh was good to the foreigner, which is why he got lavish praise. Chidambaram was beneficial to Indians, hence is regarded with scorn. 

.


&gt; Today the Indian is a composite of Vedic, Mughal and Western traditions, each fusing seamlessly into the other, as music and dance demonstrate. The solution lies not in Hindutva or in the turning away from religion that ""secularist"" purists demand. The solution lies in Indutva.

&gt; Ironically, Chandrababu Naidu and Union Minister M Venkaiah Naidu, who have been batting for the SCS for several months, slowly, yet steadily, tapered down the demand saying that was not the panacea to all the problems of the state. Naidu has never lost an opportunity to project the loss suffered and problems inherited by the state owing to bifurcation.

Assuming for a moment, your allegations are true, Hinduism still offers the possibility of leaving enough room for a balancing opposition to 'Hindutva', by Hindus themselves. This cannot be said of other forms of fundamentalism like Indian secular fundamentalism that brooks no dissidence. A PM declaring in public that only certain religious groups have first right on national resources or underplaying of historical Hindu persecution in a world that encourages reconciliation and not avoidance of past horrors, are reasons enough to indicate how inimical such political thinking is, to Hindus and Hinduism.

&gt; Yesterday, the Chitrapat Sena had sent a letter to the management trustees of the Mumbai auditorium.

&gt; Leo Francis, manager of Shanmukhananda Hall, read out from the letter written in Marathi. It said: ""If you invite the Pakistani artiste to the show you will have to face the Shiv Sena's ire... bar the Pakistani artiste from coming to the programme, or else you will have to face not only the anger of the Shiv Sena, but also of the patriotic people of this country.""

&gt; Randhir Roy, business head and founder of Panache Media, a Mumbai-based event management group that organises Ek Ehsas Concerts across India featuring the singer, said the **""point these guys (the Sena) are raising in the latter is valid"".**

Where's the 'threat of violence supported by the highest leaders of the party'?!


Edit: 

Also this:

&gt; Randhir Ranjan Roy, business head and founder of Mumbai-based Panache Media, which has organised three Ghulam Ali concerts in India in the past, took the decision to cancel the concert after meeting Thackeray Wednesday. “Thackeray ji said he loves Ghulam Ali ghazals, too, but one has to understand that he is a Pakistani artiste and border tensions need to be taken seriously. I agree with him at an individual level, too. By having a show like this, it feels like we are just pampering Pakistan. Four Indian Armymen were killed recently. It isn’t fair to have a Pakistani artiste’s concert at this point,” said Roy.

Now we have a column by a pro-RSS writer being dismissed for speaking out against anti-meat campaign probably powered on by these fundamentalist vegetarians! (RSS did something similar with M. G. Vaidya, who had suggested that Modiji was probably behind the campaigns against Gadkariji's business enterprises.)

5749,"*Babua*, nobody ever claimed that the entire *Dharmic* society is 100% bereft of or incapable of indulging in violence. You, and several others who have shown appreciation of the extremely misleading parent comment, seem to have nurtured the idea that a *Dharmic* society is some kind of a defeatist/pacifist society that practices absolute non-violence. That is utterly wrong.

In a nutshell, *dharma* is what you should do, and *karma* is what you actually do. Hindu philosophies state that your *karma* should be in accordance with your *dharma*, because only then the person of you and the society you are a part of, will find harmony. Now *dharma* is said to be dictated by inherent aptitude - if a child born into a warrior family has leanings towards business then their *dharma* is that of a *Vaishya*, and their *karma* should be in accordance with that.

The entire premise of the *Bhagvad Gita* is based upon that Arjuna goes weak in the knees when he sees his near and dear ones on the battlefield and hence refuses to indulge in 'violence' against them. Which is when Krishna counsels him and reminds him that Arjuna has to do his duty as a warrior first!

Also, here's Gandhi on violence:

&gt; I WOULD risk violence a thousand times rather than risk the emasculation of a whole race.

.

&gt; I do believe that, where there is only a choice between cowardice and violence, I would advise violence... I would rather have India resort to arms in order to defend her honour than that she should, in a cowardly manner, become or remain a helpless witness to her own dishonor.
But I believe that nonviolence is infinitely superior to violence, forgiveness is more manly than punishment. Forgiveness adorns a soldier...But abstinence is forgiveness only when there is the power to punish; it is meaningless when it pretends to proceed from a helpless creature....
But I do not believe India to be helpless....I do not believe myself to be a helpless creature....Strength does not come from physical capacity. It comes from an indomitable will.

&gt; We do want to drive out the best in the man, but we do not want on that account to emasculate him. And in the process of finding his own status, the beast in him is bound now and again to put up his ugly appearance.

&gt; The world is not entirely governed by logic. Life itself involves some kind of violence and we have to choose the path of least violence.

[Source](http://www.mkgandhi.org/nonviolence/phil8.htm)

So, you see the notion that violence is always absent from a *Dharmic* society is absolutely wrong. Violence can be, and has been used towards the greater good.

5777,"&gt; Nope, the part where they say something to the effect of ""the Sena described late rationalist Govind Pansare as a “dharma virodhi” (anti-religious) even as it glorified the work of Sanatan Sanstha""

I have a feeling you are reading only my replies to you. Elsewhere on this thread, I have brought to the notice of another user that the Sena has described the Sanstha as being active in the field of religion and spirituality. True to sant Tukaram's advice - [निंदकाचे घर असावे शेजारी](http://www.esakal.com/esakal/20100713/5231324435484315241.htm), they have said in Saamna that they consider the presence of such critics of religion to be very important for constant reform and course corrections to be part of the evolution of Hinduism, as 'Hinduism has emerged stronger after passing through such tests'. Whether to believe Saamna quoted in my link, or the Indian Express, is up to you.

&gt; yeah, but you don't actually support murderers or their organizations under that stance. Also, it is one thing when a pseudo-liberal flaming piece of shit says something stupid like that, but it is another thing altogether when the leader of a major political party which has some power in the city says this. The levels of impact are different and you know this. Seriously, are you comparing a figure as prominent as Uddhav Thackeray with every other pseudo-lib scourge?

Again, please please **read** the Saamna article. They have clearly and strongly condemned the murder. If this was not enough, just a few days ago there was a pronouncement from them that dastardly attacks on such reformers are not acceptable, even if we disagree with them on certain matters.

All they said is investigating agencies should consider all possibilities instead of hounding only specific people. Because as we know public attention span is notoriously short, even if it emerges that it was someone not connected to the Sanstha was actually responsible for the murder, the blot on pro-Hindu organizations will remain. This is why I provided you the link to the Jhabua thing. At the time, there was a massive uproar because of alleged persecution of helpless missionaries by the 'cruel' Hindus. Reams were dedicated to slamming anyone pro-Hindu, and later when it emerged that half the rapist gang was Christian themselves, no proportionate coverage was given to that. In other words, the damage was already done. This is what Saamna is trying to say - don't demonize anyone before the truth behind Pansare's murder comes out!



&gt; That part is fine. The part about the Sena expressing solidarity with SS in the face of this murder is shitty.

Do you have any conclusive evidence that has withstood legal scrutiny that the Sanstha sanctioned this murder? How have you already started demonization of the organization before investigative agencies even zeroed on the real culprit? 

&gt; yeah, fuck those bastards too. like I said before, I am indifferent to political affiliation, just against stupidity. The fact that some other chutiya did it does not make the Sena any less stupid in the case at hand. It would be daft to ignore the anti-rational undercurrent in their statement. 

The only reason I quoted the Communal Violence Prevention Bill was to illustrate to you how you're not the only one who might feel 'persecuted' in this nation, how it was not a regional party that expressed it's views but a Union Government that was about to almost indulge in legally-sanctioned persecution of the majority for just being Hindu! When I am explaining to you in the first place, that whatever the Sena said here was in no way supportive of the murder at all, how can I even attempt to 'justify' this alleged stupidity at all?! When they have clearly said that they have no problems with critiques by rationalists so that Hinduism can continue reforming itself, I fail to see how anyone can make out undercurrents of anti-rationalism unless of course, they have a deep-seated aversion that makes them see almost every such statement by the Sena in negative light. 

&gt; Does it possibly have anything to do with the Sena's use of Shivaji and Pansare's book Shivaji Kon Hota, which presents a rather ""unhealthy"" picture of Shivaji?

Shivaji Kon Hota presents the warrior as a pro-people king than merely pro-Brahmin (*gou-Brahman pratipalak*). And, as I have illustrated with the help of several instances before, it is not the Shiv Sena which obsesses over the *sattvik* Brahmin agenda as much as some others.

Pertinent to note, Pansare was one of the Communist leaders who had himself participated in the Samayukta Maharashtra agitations which were also led by Prabodhankar Thackeray. ",2015-09-29 11:09:18+00:00,cvhy8m2,12.0,t1_cvhvq95,11491.0,india

Shit like what? That investigating agencies should proceed in an impartial manner, than be guided by ambient noise? What's wrong with saying the investigation should be impartial and dispassionate?

&gt; And wtf is dharma virodhi? 

Have clarified this in another comment on this thread.

&gt; The position is very confusing. One the one hand you condemn the murder and on the other hand you support the organization whose member does it based on ideological justification, not personal enemity.

Really? Is it confusing too when liberal-types fashionably quote 'I do not agree with what you have to say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it'? How does ~~the same~~ a similar thing suddenly become threatening when a vernacular newspaper says it?! 

&gt; Also, on a personal level, as an atheist, this is scary.

You're feeling threatened when a regional party has asked for not jumping to conclusions based on hearsay? Imagine us Hindus' plight when a Central Government had appointed Hinduphobes on an extra-Constitutional 'Advisory' Committee, that among other things strongly pushed for a National Law that automatically implicated Hindus caught in communal frenzy, and put the burden of proving innocence on them!


Only the naive, the misinformed and the highly strung will feel 'threatened' by such 'support'. Remember, we're a nation where [scaremongering](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1e8hd1/til_twelve_of_the_twentyfour_accused_in_the_1998/?ref=search_posts) and [denialism](http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/to-keep-the-peace-i-misled-people-on--93-blasts-pawar--------/10419/) both, have been used by wily politicians to achieve their ends.

Had you taken the effort to go through the link I provided, or asked someone for a translation instead of directly assuming your question was not deliberately answered, you'd have realized your question, if I agree that the Sanstha has done 'glorious' work, has no basis. Because the link shows Saamna said the Sanstha has been indulging in activities of religious and spiritual nature. Hardly anywhere close to labeling it 'glorious'.

The answer to your second question is very evident in my reply. I did say Pansare was seen as indulging in activities as going against religion on account of his support for the Anti-Superstition Act the draft of which was itself amended by a 'secular' government.

2] Here's an extract from said piece:

&gt; आगे शिवसेना ने लिखा है, ""गोविंद पानसरे की हत्या का हमने (शिवसेना) विरोध किया है, लेकिन इसका यह अर्थ नहीं है कि हम उनके विचारों से पूरी तरह सहमत हैं। पानसरे हो या और कोई और महाराष्ट्र में किसी की हत्या होना अमानुष कृत्य है।""
पानसरे के विचारों पर सवालियां निशान लगाते हुए लिखा गया है, ""पानसरे द्वारा की गई आलोचना से हिंदूत्व का जरा सा भी नुकसान नहीं हुआ है। बल्कि हम गर्व से कहते हैं कि पानसरे जैसे धर्मविरोधियों को हमारे बारे में बोलना चाहिए। लोकतंत्र में सबको विचार रखने का मौका मिलना चाहिए। पानसरे, दाभोलकर व कर्नाटक के कलबुर्गी जैसे लोगों की हत्या समाज पर कलंक के सामान है। कुछ का अनुमान है कि पानसरे ने शिवाजी महाराज को लेकर जो लिखा उसकी वजह से उनकी हत्या हुई होगी। लेकिन पंडित नेहरु, मोररजी देसाई जैसे बड़े नेताओं ने भी तो शिवाजी महाराज को लेकर गलत बयान दिए थे। लेकिन महाराष्ट्र की जनता ने उनका अहिंसक मार्ग से विरोध किया न कि हिंसा से।""

&gt; अंत में सामना में लिखा गया है,""पानसरे दाभोलकर के असली हत्यारों को और हत्या की वजह को ढूंढ़ निकालना होगा। असली गुनहगारों को छूट नहीं मिलनी चाहिए और बेवजह हिंदूत्व को बदनाम न किया जाए।""

Pansare's support for the vaguely-worded Anti-Superstition Act, which would have criminalized acts like *kirtans* that involve telling of miraculous tales would be construed as going against their religion by many people. In fact, it was a 'secular' state government that addressed such concerns by making necessary amends.

Notably, the snapshot of the original Saamna article says the Sena consider such critics as essential for Hinduism to reform and refine itself and thus grow stronger, which the Dainik Bhaskar fails to mention in it's story. Let's not even begin to expect the English dailies would do any better.

5836,"&gt; There is nothing wrong with butter or ghee 

Consider this:

&gt; Most foods contain several different kinds of fat, and some are better for your health than others. You don't need to completely eliminate all fat from your diet. In fact, some fats actually help promote good health. But it's wise to choose the healthier types of dietary fat and then enjoy them — in moderation.

&gt; There are two main types of potentially harmful dietary fat — fat that is mostly saturated and fat that contains trans fat:

&gt; - Saturated fat. This is a type of fat that comes mainly from animal sources of food, such as red meat, poultry and full-fat dairy products. Saturated fat raises total blood cholesterol levels and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, which can increase your risk of cardiovascular disease. Saturated fat may also increase your risk of type 2 diabetes.
 
&gt; - Trans fat. This is a type of fat that occurs naturally in some foods in small amounts. But most trans fats are made from oils through a food processing method called partial hydrogenation. By partially hydrogenating oils, they become easier to cook with and less likely to spoil than do naturally occurring oils. Research studies show that these partially hydrogenated trans fats can increase unhealthy LDL cholesterol and lower healthy high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. This can increase your risk of cardiovascular disease.

&gt; Most fats that have a high percentage of saturated fat or that contain trans fat are solid at room temperature. Because of this, they're typically referred to as solid fats. They include beef fat, pork fat, **butter**, shortening and stick margarine.

[Source: Dietary fats: Know which types to choose; Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/fat/art-20045550)

&gt; The Australian Dietary Guidelines recommend that:

&gt; - you replace high-fat foods that contain predominately saturated fats such as **butter**, cream, cooking margarine, coconut and palm oil, with foods that contain predominately polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats such as oils, spreads, nut butters and pastes, and avocado.

&gt; A 2011 study by scientists from the National Dairy Research Institute in Haryana, published in The Indian Journal of Medical Research, states that ghee from cow’s milk could actually protect us from cancer as it “enhances the availability of enzymes responsible for detoxification of cancer-causing substances”.“The doubt related to ghee exists because of half information. People believe that packaged oils are healthy. In fact, it is best to avoid saturated fat that comes in ‘fibre-rich’ biscuits and ‘iron-enriched’ cereals and switch to ghee as it provides the type of fat needed for absorbing fat-soluble vitamins like A and E,” says Diwekar. Ghee serves as an antioxidant and is good for the immune system because it acts as a medium for the absorption of all fat-soluble vitamins. Besides, it has a high concentration of butyric acids and fatty acids that contain antiviral properties.

&gt; Despite the thumbs up from some dietitians, doctors are still cautious about ghee. Mitendra Singh Yadav, consultant cardiologist, Max Super Speciality Hospital, Saket, New Delhi, says ghee is “just another saturated fat” and should be avoided. “There is no nutritional value of milk that is left in the ghee. It is dangerous for adolescents and adults, and more so if you are a heart patient or obese, as it clogs your arteries,” says Dr Yadav. “Young children, however, should have ghee as their body needs fats. For the rest, just keep ghee for occasional events,” he adds.

&gt; from diet point of view wheat is worse than butter or ghee.

There's no way really to compare detrimental effects of wheat vs butter/ghee. Because despite that Medical and Dietary Associations worldwide recommend *substituting* butter with healthier alternatives like olive oil as far as possible, whole wheat continues being promoted for it's high fiber content.

Of course, when one has diabetes both have to be curtailed. 


&gt; Blood naturally has a chemical which prevents clogging. When your sugar level raises because of eating carbs, the sugar kills that chemical. Diabetics have heart attacks because of their sugar levels rather than anything else.

5852,"TBH, I was surprised to not find 'Kerala' at the top but then soon realized OP had worded his request for participation saying he wants to know where users are *located*, as opposed to their linguistic/ethnic background.

Quite a few such surveys had established that Malayalees form the largest chunk of users here.

But considering TN has been producing a jobs at a rate more than Gujarat and even Maharashtra, coupled with the 'Kerala model' that is increasingly being questioned for it's financial contribution to the national economy, it becomes clear TN would have cornered a big chunk of Malayalees looking for jobs which is why Kerala is quite lower down in this OP's list.

The skew of topics and comments shows a few interesting trends - Malayalees probably held the pro-secular bastion in the pre-AAP days; they were joined by AAP supporters who distinctly give off the Delhi/Punjab/Haryana vibe. The other big group is obviously pro-BJP and pro-Modi supporters; the former defends a lot of things Hindu while the latter will not hesitate to condemn anything Hindu that might be seen as tarnishing the image of their leader.

The large number of southerners also explains why, despite lamentations that the world despises us as a nation of rapists, this sub itself often upvotes news about rape especially in northern India, right to the front page! A lot of this behavior is probably rooted in the deep seated resentment against northerners allegedly trying to impose their culture, language on the rest of the nation.

Treatment of Maharashtra and Karnataka topics here is interesting - submissions about pro-Marathi or pro-Kannada measures gets upvoted and a lot of nasty, angry comments while those about far worse things happening elsewhere in the nation barely reaches front page. Guess that's the price to be paid for harboring cosmopolitanism.

Amusingly, some users who post stuff about/have strong opinions about things happening in Maharashtra/Karnataka avoid giving visibility to similar happenings in their own state. For example, I was once told off how badly mismanaged Mumbai Metro is turning out to be, and just in the next few days, there was news of a horrible accident that happened at the Chennai Metro construction site. *I* posted it, it reached front page which is when *another* user from TN blew the lid (for the rest of us here), on how Chennai Metro has been messed up too! The same user once told me how Maharashtra is a cesspool of caste politics (this was probably during the Maratha reservation thing), and just a few days later, another TN user ticked off the same Tamil warrior how TN society is a basket case as far as caste-based discrimination is concerned! Said warrior also once described how Chennai is an oh-so-awesomely-cosmopolitan city which is when I had to bring to his notice the ethnic minorities he mentioned as living in perfect harmony in Chennai, were all ethnic Dravidian groups, no match for the kind of diversity you see in Bengaluru or a large Maharashtra city!

&gt; The Indian jury to select India's official entry to the Oscars 2016, helmed by chairperson Amol Palekar, is all set to meet away from Bollywood and Mumbai in Hyderabad to decide on which of our films from 2015 goes to the Oscars . This is the second year in a row when Hyderabad has been chosen as the venue for the proceedings. According to sources Hyderabad is likely to remain the hub of Oscar activity on the coming years. ""The jury to select the Indian entry to the Oscars is put under tremendous pressure in Mumbai to select a Bollywood film. This year too there is heavy lobbying in Mumbai for films like **Vishal Bhardwaj**'s Haidar, **Anurag Kashyap**'s Ugly, **Raj Kumar Hirani**'s Pk and Omung Kumar's Mary Kom as Indian's Oscar entry. To avoid being 'Bollywoodized' the Oscar committee has moved from Mumbai to Hyderabad, far away from the madding crowd of lobbyists. 

[Source](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0712541/news?ref_=nm_phs_nw)


&gt; However sources say that there is intense lobbying for Vishal Bhardwaj's Haider, Rajkumar Hirani's PK, Anurag Kashyap's Ugly and Umang Kumar's Mary Kom to make the cut.

&gt; In the past few years, there has been disagreement between the jury's choice and what the film industry - read Bollywood - feels is the best choice. Hope this year they find common ground.

So now, a Bollywood director of Sunny Deol masala movies who has no qualms getting into [nasty spats](http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/imran-khan-is-mentally-challenged-tweets-director-rahul-rawail/) with young budding actors, and whose son who once [assaulted an evangelist](http://www.punemirror.in/entertainment/bollywood/Police-complaint-against-Rahul-Rawail-and-family/articleshow/31594619.cms) and is a budding director himself versus a [reclusive National Award-winning](http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/a-date-with-amol/article5582224.ece) agnostic actor-director who has proudly accepted his openly lesbian daughter for what she is, and has [daringly spoken out on significant issues](http://www.firstpost.com/india/dabholkars-murder-amol-palekar-calls-out-maharasthras-intolerance-to-dissent-1052161.html) and [acted upon some](http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-amol-palekar-wife-move-bombay-high-court-on-deletion-of-names-from-voters-list-1985393)?

If there are two sides: the Bhardwaj/Hirani/Kashyaps of Bollywood vs the alternative, quasi-subversive, FTII/KKM 'Court' types, it is adequately clear Rawail would pick the former (remember: his son is a budding director) and Amol would have absolutely no qualms with the latter.

5931,"&gt; Exactly

That is no disqualification in any way, because of the open nature of Hinduism.

&gt; Which isn't the way most hindus identify it and also people (out ministers as well) are riddled with superstition abolishing which is a difficult task which no one wants to do.

Even if most Hindus do not identify it that way, it remains that Hinduism is a way of life that can be customized like no other religion. So, the way other Hindus worship really remains an academic issue with barely any real world implications for someone who does not want to associate with the same. You live your life, they live theirs. Quite unlike as in some other religious nations!

Also, let's not bring 'superstition' into this discussion about the spiritual (and not the ritualistic) aspect of Hinduism.",2015-09-23 22:05:56+00:00,cvbvv4m,25.0,t1_cvbvkg8,466.0,india
5932,"&gt; Indeed, but the gift ""Gita"" still represents Hindus and India is not a Hindu country which is why Gita doesn't represent India.

There is no exclusionary clause that says the Gita represents only Hindus. For example, if [anyone who says they derived inspiration from Gita](http://www.firstpost.com/living/three-books-that-influenced-apj-abdul-kalam-deeply-2367912.html) wants to be represented by the Gita, nothing can stop them from achieving that status. Thus, saying the Gita represents only Hindus is wrong.

The issue is not at all about numerical superiority of Gita vs Constitution acceptors, but that the Gita represents Indian spiritual and philosophic thought. Which the Constitution does not, which is why you probably did not advocate gifting a copy of the same to a foreign leader!",2015-09-23 22:00:18+00:00,cvbvnhx,21.0,t1_cvbv8s4,629.0,india
5933,"&gt; Which provision favours a particular religion? Says any single one is better than the other?

It is associated strongly with Hinduism.

5934,"&gt; The gift at least needs to be politically correct, represent the country constitutionally.

There are no Constitutional provisions for ensuring adherence to political correctness of such gifts. And anyway, such political correctness has often worked to the *relative* detriment of Hindus.

5935,"&gt; There is no provision in constitution favouring any religion over another

There are such provisions, but that's another topic altogether. Fact remains that Dr Babasaheb refused to endorse strict separation of religion and state.

&gt; Which doesn't identify any single religion as superior which fails the religious nation argument when you cannot say which one is the supreme religion.

Again, comes the question of parameters. How does one define 'supreme'? Going by your previous comments, if acceptability is important then the Gita is the natural choice.

&gt; Gita is for brainwashing, and screw the church also shit on all religion.

Gita is for spiritual guidance. Also, Hinduism is really a ['way of life'](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Hinduism-is-a-way-of-life-SC/articleshow/1087322.cms)",2015-09-23 21:44:19+00:00,cvbv139,21.0,t1_cvbuond,529.0,india

5980,"&gt; i was expecting Masaan but the board seems to be extra supportive to marathi films, in the last few years they have selected so many marathi movies over good movies knowing that even if the marathi film is selected , they lack the funds to lobby and advertise. 

Winning an Oscar might bring a windfall in terms of revenue etc for the people associated with the movie, but over the longer term it is always actual content that wins. For example, ['Brokeback' remains a strong favorite](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/recount-oscar-voters-today-would-773522), while the movie that pipped it to the [Best Picture is reviled](http://www.theawl.com/2013/02/crash-the-most-loathsome-best-picture-of-them-all)! With passage of time, as the rewards of winning the award reduce to a trickle, what remains is just art - [Citizen Kane too failed to win Best Picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_Academy_Awards), and yet to this day that movie remains near the top of lists of best movies ever made!

So, even if said Marathi movies whose makers lack lobbying funds, get nominated and they do not win, at least we're spared the ignominy of having sent something like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeans_%28film%29), as our contender!

If Masaan is indeed so good, in due course it will surely get recognition as did Citizen Kane. Award or no award, the art of it will triumph.

It is only this year that the BJP dominated Mira-Bhayandar municipal corporation imposed an unprecedented eight day ban on meat sale and strictly enforced it. Taking a cue, a group of BJP MLAs, councillors and Jain community persons met the municipal commissioner and sought to extend this to Mumbai city and have a similar eight day ban on meat sale across the city. 

So Congress had done the same as Haryana BJP minister did this year with their Paryushan meat ban - issued an 'appeal', which BJP supporters as defense for her actions.

&gt; Everything is not a god damned conflict.

He was never involved in nasty controversies like many other stars - remember the Chris Brown and Christian Bale stories?! His claim to fame was largely a movie franchise revolving around facing fast cars. Also, AFAIK it was not Paul who was driving the car that crashed but his business partner.


People who die young often capture, and live on in, popular imagination probably because the tragedy of their short lives often moves us humans. Marilyn Monroe, Heath Ledger, River Phoenix, Lady Diana - their lives and deaths will always remain enigmatic to us. Paul's death is also reminiscent of that of another immensely loved star, James Dean whose life met a similar unfortunate end.

Probably, no idea if there are indeed such requirements.

&gt; Why? If they have been in the state for 200+ years, even before 90% of Maharashtrians landed there. Should the Parsi community be forced to learn Marathi as well?


Of course! Just because they have been around for 200 years, is it okay if they say we will not respect the national anthem that came much later?!

&gt; Because having people learn a new language as a matter of compulsion is infeasible. Unless the intention is to curb migration across the country. And this is just protectionism. Which is pretty much what this is, anyway.

Why make this out to be protectionism, and not an attempt to protect the language? After all, not like the rule says people whose native language is not Marathi will not be given permits, but that anyone who knows Marathi will be given a permit.

&gt; The only way a multilingual society can function is when nobody is forced to learn anything and the government at all levels stays out the process of promoting one language over others.

Looking at the issue in entirety that it is expected that non-Marathis who have been living in the state 'since generations' as a user furiously has been saying all over the thread, it is expected that they should have learned Marathi by now.

If they still haven't, only shows how utterly in contempt they hold the language and culture of the very state they settled in!

&gt; Why should new comers only be tested in Marathi? Because that is spoken by a plurality ? That kind of sounds like imposition to me.

Yes.

It is to be presumed the Gujaratis living here must have picked up Marathi. They should.

6314,"&gt; Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh said “Hindi was not getting its due respect” and some “so-called intellectuals continued to promote English.” 

&gt; Mr. Singh said he had nothing against any language. But Hindi was the language that connected every part of the country. “ Demand to make Hindi our official language came first from non-Hindi speaking leaders like Bal Gangdadhar Tilak,” he said. 

These disingenuous BJP-RSS retards have been using the name of Tilak to push through their Hindi imperialist agenda, slyly neglecting to mention that Tilak himself strove to make English education popular way back since the nineteenth century:

&gt; The young Tilak was educated at Deccan College in Poona, where in 1876,he earned bachelor’s degrees in mathematics and Sanskrit. Tilak then studied law, receiving his degree in 1879 from the University of Bombay (now Mumbai). At that point, however, he decided to teach mathematics in a private school in Poona. The school became the basis for his political career. He developed the institution into a university college after founding the Deccan Education Society (1884), which aimed at **educating the masses, especially in the English language**; he and his associates **considered English to be a powerful force for the dissemination of liberal and democratic ideals.**

&gt; The life members of the society were expected to follow an ideal of selfless service, but when Tilak learned that some members were keeping outside earnings for themselves, he resigned. He then turned to the task of awakening the political consciousness of the people through two weekly newspapers that he owned and edited: Kesari (“The Lion”), published in Marathi, and **The Mahratta, published in English.**



[Source](http://www.britannica.com/biography/Bal-Gangadhar-Tilak)

So fluent were nationalists of those days in English, that Tilak and Agarkar would debate with each other not in their mother tongue Marathi or 'raj bhasha' Hindi, but in the Imperial language English!

Rajnath sure would love to forget that.

They do respect other languages, they also respect Hindi. What they always ask for, is for Marathi to be respected in it's own home state.

Times change, people change. Again, read about the history of Mumbai. It took the deaths of nearly 105 Mumbaikars for the Central Government to accede to their demands of creation of a separate Samayukta Maharashtra state with Mumbai as it's capital. Our nation is one with a very hoary history of feudalism where hierarchy matters a lot. Making yourself heard takes extraordinary measures and because the Sena represents the lower middle urban working class, they had to innovate to make a mark on the nation's consciousness. Let's face it, this is the harsh reality of our nation - till the time Dr Babasaheb started his religious conversion programs, we never took his movement and concerns seriously. As a nation, we are notoriously inertial, we need a jolt to wake us up. We always have needed a jolt to wake us up.

If you want to do volunteering, I'd suggest work with the weaker sections of society for they need you the most. The farmers of Marathwada are suffering, people are committing suicide for want of sums as low as 10k. Not saying you help them financially, but you could liaise, raise awareness of government schemes, maybe rope in your friends and acquaintances to raise resources. If at all you want to work to raise awareness about the dangers of drunk driving, go about it in a non-confrontational manner. People have been killed by drunk hotheads in brawls outside pubs. Try not to get in trouble, you don't seem to be one who can countenance physical violence. Get in touch with the local Sena shakha and ask how you can help. They always have a lot of local issues and you could lend a helping hand. Let volunteering begin at home!

Mr MyselfWalrus had once linked to an article citing Sanjay Raut of Sena was not in favor of the beef ban but I believe they wouldn't oppose because after all, it is a question of the religious feelings of Hindus living in their spiritual homeland. It is almost impossible to separate Indians from religion (religion necessarily does not always have negative connotations), and Dr Babasaheb probably recognized that. Which is why he opposed measures to get India declared a secular nation in true sense of the word.

6398,"Read it in an Arvind Sawant interview I had linked here few days ago. Also, the current state Health Minister who is from Sena is a far cry from the likes of the Union ex-Health Minister Ghulam Nabi who said that homosexuality is a disease! The former takes health issues of gays pretty seriously and has taken good initiatives for the community.

They have advocated English education in a nation where the ideological fountainheads of our most suave party wants Hindi to displace English! The Sena has traditionally opposed casteism, superstitions, anti-meat and anti-liquor lobbies and it has always been seen as pro-social reform. The role of women among the Shiv Sena cadre is notable.

They are a hyper local party who have a strong grassroots network; their anti-Valentine Day stance was rooted in concerns of parents who were afraid youngsters were getting increasingly getting enamored of an event that has been known elsewhere [to take a toll](http://mentalhealth.about.com/library/weekly/aa013100a.htm). Opposition to Valentine's Day has been seen [not only in non-progressive regions](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-02-14/japanese-men-protest-valentines-day-/6101788), there are anti-Valentine Day events [held in some places!](http://now-here-this.timeout.com/2015/02/11/five-anti-valentines-day-parties/) Point is, opposing Valentine's Day is no biggie.

There's an example I have quoted here months ago - the issue of recruitment of local Marathi youth in Railways had been raised time and again. The babus sitting far away in their air-conditioned offices in Delhi could barely be made to care. Enter MNS, they addressed it in their inimitable style. Result - Railway Minister announced sweeping national changes in the manner recruitment to jobs in Railways was conducted and hence today, youth from all non-Hindi states stand a better chance at landing those jobs than ever before.

6468,"&gt; MNS is opposing and openly mocking Jainism here - an ancient religion only around a thousand years younger than Hinduism which enjoyed overwhelming popularity in classical era. And it isn't that different from other Indian religions.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I figured if they can sink that low, these retarded goons would openly mock Buddhism when it suits them too. And what better to annoy Buddhists than to sing praises of a man who committed genocides on them, caused their religion to die out in India, and destroyed their largest monastery/university ever, along with a good portion of Indian history records that used to be there?

For you to speculate that they would sing praises of Khilji, you have to have a basis in past actions wherein they have ever praised Hindu/Buddhist-killers. And let me assure you, there is no such instance. Which is why, you quoting Khilji comes across as extremely ignorant and narrow-minded.

&gt; What speculations, may I ask? I am not against those who eat meat at all. It is their wish, their free will, their choice and I completely respect that.

&gt; I just personally don't do it or wish to stare at someone doing it or look at anything related to it in real life (dead bodies of animals).


By 'speculations', I meant you hypothesizing that these guys might praise Khilji. And let me tell you, I am a vegetarian too. I used to eat meat as a child but never liked the idea of eating some animal's body so gave it up when I got control over my diet. And I was curious but at the same time used to hate looking at cut up animals as a schoolkid. So I understand where you came from.

In those days, a two-day ban for a largely docile minority who had always played positive role in society might have seemed magnanimous. Fast forward to 2015, where Jains have taken over Palitana, BJP has become overconfident and arrogant, and the two-day ban is being extended to eight days.

&gt; ""This is the first time that such a ban order has been issued. It is ironical why no such order is issued during Navratri,"" said Salim, a spokesperson for a Meat Market Association.

&gt; In a circular issued to all municipal bodies, the state government has asked meat shop vendors to close their shops and stop sale of meat and fish on September 17 in view of Jain community's 'Paryushan' (Jain fasting) festival, on September 18 on account of 'Sanvatsari' (another Jain festival), and September 27 on 'Anant Chaturdashi', an official said.

[Source](http://www.ibnlive.com/news/india/now-haryana-bans-sale-of-meat-for-9-days-during-jain-festival-of-paryushan-1093601.html)


&gt; Municipalities across the state today started implementing the ban order, which was issued in concurrence with the directive of the Directorate of Urban Local Bodies. Dhaba owners, meat and chicken sellers and butchers have protested the move.

&gt; A few days ago, a delegation of the Jain community had met Urban Local Minister Kavita Jain and urged her to keep the slaughter houses closed during “Paryushan Parva”. Jain later urged  municipal officials to appeal to owners of slaughter houses to keep them closed during the festival.

&gt; Even though Jain had not issued any order, the urban local bodies department seemed to have gone overboard to “please” the minister with municipalities across the state enforcing the ban. The notice (a copy is with The Tribune) issued by the Fatehabad Municipal Council to the slaughter house owners warned them of legal action in case they violated its order.

&gt; In Fatehabad, notices have been served on as many 27 meat and chicken sellers and butchers by Municipal Council’s Executive Officer OP Sihag. Sirsa Municipal Council’s Executive Officer Attar Singh also confirmed having served notices in the town.

Though technically (assuming you meant geographically - south of Vindhyas, part of Peninsula etc) Maharashtra could be said to be southern Indian, their language originates from Prakrit which was in a way slang Sanskrit! 

Their patron god is Vitthal, who is but Lord Vishnu, cast not in milky white as the famously dark Krishna is depicted in several temples in northern India, but [jet black](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2RjazbN-9ho/VM9_BZmLdYI/AAAAAAAACas/HLQU5_W3NzQ/s1600/Lord-Vitthal-Wallpaper-Photos-2015%2B%2B%282%29.jpg) - the laypeople's God; in fact they sing to him '[कानडा हो विठ्ठलु कर्नाटकु । तेणें मज लावियला वेधु  ||](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHV60y_fhz8)' which translates as 'Vitthal from Karnataka is difficult to understand, but he has indeed taken hold of my mind'.

Marathis are said to be largely of Dravidian stock, but the 'Aryan' strain in them is apparent too. *Some* Brahmins here are originally [from the northern parts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daivadnya_Brahmin), some are even claimed by [Israelites to be their blood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitpavan#Origin), the [Chandraseniye Kayastha Prabhus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandraseniya_Kayastha_Prabhu) like Balasaheb Thackeray, [Anil Tipnis](http://www.tribuneindia.com/2001/20010715/main6.htm) and Sonali Bendre have origins in Magadha, while Dravidian and Aryan admixture with local tribes like Bhil, Kolis etc along with a sense of identity as members of a 'Maha rashtra' - [*Maratha sutar, Maratha lohar* etc](http://jainismus.hubpages.com/hub/marathas) gave us the martial peasants we today call just ['Marathas'](http://www.britannica.com/topic/Maratha), who are worshippers of [Khandoba](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1qvcu8/til_khandoba_is_a_deity_of_the_deccan_worshipped/) as well as Vitthal.

Relevant:

&gt; **Geography**: If location were the yardstick, Maharashtra would surely be down south, political correctness notwithstanding. By definition, the Indo-Gangetic plain and the Deccan plateau divide India into the north and the south, though according to some sources, it is the Vindhya, the Narmada or the Satpura mountains. Still, under most of these conditions, major portions of Maharashtra fall in the southern part of the country. A large part of the Deccan plateau lies in this state and most parts of this state are below the river and the ranges mentioned above. Still, conventional wisdom has it that Maharashtra is a north Indian state, mostly because of the great linguistic divide.

&gt; **Language**: There would probably be no two opinions on the position that Marathi, the lingua franca of most of the Maharashtrian people, is a Prakrit corruption of Sanskrit and has little or no Tamil derivation. It is, in this context, an Aryan language with minimal Dravidian influences, which many would suggest makes Maharashtra a north Indian state. Here it would be of interest to the reader to note that Marathi is not the only language spoken in the state and that some Maharashtrian languages do have Dravidian influences(1).

&gt; As regards division of states on a linguistic basis, it would be interesting to mention here that Brahui, one of the languages spoken by the Baloch people of Pakistan, is known to be very closely related to Tamil and has therefore been termed a Dravidian language(2). Despite this, I doubt if the region of Balochistan in which Brahui is spoken would ever have been categorised as a Dravidian state, even in an undivided India. The argument compartmentalising states on a linguistic basis therefore stands on shaky ground.

&gt; **History**: Historically, most of northern India and southern India are seemingly separate entities, as our historians would have us believe. Most of northern India, except perhaps during Ashoka's reign(3), was ruled by regimes different from those that ruled southern India. Putting it another way, the south of India had its own flourishing empires seldom overlapping those of the north. Maharashtra was ruled by various Hindu and Buddhist kings; the Mauryas of central India to the Yadavs of Deogiri. Then came Alladin Khilji and Muslim rule in this part of India, even then, many of the Muslim rulers of Maharashtra (except when it was under Delhi's influence) also ruled a lot of southern India and were fighting the Mughals and other rulers who were then controlling large parts of northern India. Finally when the aspirations of the Marathi people to govern themselves were realised and the empire expanded, the Marathas, at their peak, controlled regions(4) from Attock in present day North West Frontier Province (NWFP) of Pakistan, to Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu. **The point is that Maharashtra was ruled at different times by regimes whose power centres were situated in northern or southern India and when the state itself was the power centre it ruled regions both north and south of it.**

&gt; The natives of present day Maharashtra are an inseparable mix of the original Bhil, Naga and other tribals, Shakas, Huns, Rashtrakutas, Yadavs, Chalukyas etc. and some people from central Asia and eastern Europe. It is therefore difficult to nail down where Maharashtra would be positioned if history, the reign of southern or northern Indian kings, or the composition of its people were to be used as a deciding factor.

&gt; **Cuisine**: The food of the people of Maharashtra is as rich and varied as its history. It is a popular notion that rice is the staple food of most of southern India whereas a lot of northern India thrives on the various forms of bread that are on offer, from puris to parathas (with the notable exceptions of parts of eastern India and Kashmir). Bhakri, a bread made from whole jowar or bajra grain flour and baked on flat pans, used to predominate in a lot of Maharashtrian households. Rice however was also almost as popular (if not more) and there are an amazing variety of rice dishes from the spicy Masale bhaat to the sweet Narali bhaat (coconut rice). Interestingly, though rice consumption is assumed to be more of a southern trait, the word bhaat, which stands for rice in Marathi, is shared with several northern languages and is only rarely used in south Indian languages and thus the origin of this custom is likely to have been shared with the northern parts of India. Strangely, most non-Maharashtrians are absolutely ignorant about Maharashtrian cuisine. However, given the Marathi proficiency at marketing something or rather the lack of it, one can hardly be blamed for thinking that Marathi cuisine begins and ends with Vada Pao (a popular but relatively recent addition to the huge repertoire of what is essentially Mumbai street food). While a lot of Maharashtrian dishes resemble north Indian dishes in style and content, the generous use of coconut, curry leaves, tamarind and lentils is largely a southern way of cooking. Needless to mention the use of exotic substances such as the tangy Kokum(5), the pungent asafoetida(6), sesame and mustard seeds and roasted peanut powder in cooking gives it a certain uniqueness combining the best from both parts of the country while bestowing upon it its own taste and flavour. For the uninitiated, Maharashtrian food not only resembles and at the same time differs from north and south Indian varieties, but it is also influenced by cuisines from Portugal to Iran, which can be seen and felt to this day. Clearly, Maharashtrian cuisine cannot be categorised as north or south.

&gt; **Culture**: The first day of the month of Chaitra(7) or Gudi Padwa, is celebrated as a New Year day for the Marathi people. This is also the Ugadi festival for the people of southern states who celebrate it with great fanfare as their New Year day(8). In contrast, Diwali, Raksha Bandhan and Holi (at least contemporary celebrations) are celebrated in ways more similar to north Indian customs. Inarguably the most popular festival in the state is the Ganapati festival and it is definitely of Maharashtrian origin(9). The attire of the people of this state, like so many other things, changes every hundred kilometres and sometimes fewer and also depends on religious, class and caste factors. While the most commonly used white dhoti-kurta combination and also the Pagdi (headgear) for Maharashtrian men in general can be safely considered more in the northern style, traditional attire for young girls seems to be a part of the southern Indian wardrobe.

&gt; Thus we can see that there is a lot of contradictory evidence to the naturally assumed principle of Maharashtra being a north Indian state. I would like to point out that this essay is not my attempt at debate about whether Maharashtra should be considered in the north or the south of India, far from it, it is introspective, since I am often asked this question and I hate to take sides. In summary, one can conclude that Maharashtra is neither in the north nor in the south or offer an equally plausible conclusion; it is as much a northern state as a southern state. I have no problems with either; my conclusion is that this state has the unique distinction of drawing from both cultures like few other states in India can claim.

Interestingly, a cursory glance at fantasy maps conjured up by proponents of 'Dravidstan', 'Dalitstan' and 'Mughalstan' shows these groups concede the area occupied by Maharashtra today will continue to remain outside their hypothetical nation-states; maybe they don't really consider Maharashtra to be part of their pet projects! :D

The first two lines clearly target the political party and last one, the supporters of the SS/MNS, while the third one very slyly evokes apocalyptic imagery and is strategically placed between condemnation of the party and it's alleged supporters. Now this is important because *let's now kick them out, demonise their religious practices, call them all fundamentalists and wish hiv/aids upon them* was done by users here and as I pointed out, not by the party. 

Now, it would be a mistake to assume all users here against the meat ban are SS supporters. In fact, majority of them are opposed to SS.

Edit:

&gt; For Periyar‟s supporters, Hindi and all ceremonies associated with Brahmins became alien symbols that should be eliminated from Tamil culture. Periyar was also against participation in the electoral politics as he believed that such deviation from their chosen path will dilute their fight against social evils. However there was a strong section of his supporters who were not averse to joining electoral politics. This section also resented some of the extremist views and acts of Periyar like hurting the sentiments of believers by insulting the Hindu Gods, inciting hatred against Brahmins and his insistence for a separate Dravida Nadu.

&gt; In 1956, Periyar organized a procession to the Marina to burn pictures of God Ram and he was subsequently arrested and confined to prison. In 1957, in his speech justifying the demand for an independent Tamil Nadu, he had asked his supporters to burn the constitution of India, holding the government responsible for maintaining the caste system.

&gt; He was highly critical of poet Subramania Bharati for portraying mother Tamil as a sister of Sanscrit in his poems. It was Periyar who led the first anti-Hindi agitation in erstwhile Madras presidency in 1938 when the state government tried to introduce Hindi as a compulsory subject in schools. 

&gt; Periyar believed that as long as Aryan religion, Aryan Vedas and Aryan domination existed, there was need for Dravidian Progressive Movement and Self-Respect Movement. He was concerned about the growing north Indian domination which was not different from foreign domination. That is one reason why he did not support the Indian independence movement and instead wanted the British rule to continue. Periyar wanted a multi-linguistic nation comprising of Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam regions of South India. At a separatist conference convened by Periyar at Kanchipuram in June 1940, he had released a map of the proposed
Dravida Nadu. The concept of Dravida Nadu was later modified down to Tamil Nadu. He was the first to raise the slogan of “Tamil Nadu for Tamilians”.

&gt; In formulating policies on issues like social justice and self-respect movement, Tamil pride and in opposing Hindi imposition, Periyar had always been the guiding spirit and a role model for all the Dravidian parties in Tamil Nadu, including the AIADMK and DMK, the two main political parties in Tamil Nadu.

&gt; His anger and hatred against Brahmins prompted him to hate Hinduism. To counter the processions taken out by Hindus during Ganesh chathurthy and Ram Navami festivals, he used to take out processions with Hindu idols like Ram, Laxman and Hanuman garlanded with slippers. Though he claimed to follow peaceful means of protest, there used to be violent clashes between his supporters and believers during such protest programmes. He had written several articles ridiculing Hindu Gods and rituals and even using vulgar language against the Hindu Gods. While the sentiments of millions of Hindu believers were hurt by his such actions and
writings, the western press and the church remained highly impressed by his tirade against Hinduism and his demand for a separate Dravida Nadu.

The issue of prickly local-vs-state government relations came to the fore with Belgaum where the Karnataka state government repeatedly over ruled majority resolutions made by the local body, though the issues were different.


Edit 1: Just came across this..

&gt; According to the SC directives, the proposal should be passed by the concerned civic body and sent to the municipal commissioner, who will then send it to the state urban development department for approval. 

[Source](http://www.asianage.com/mumbai/bjp-will-raise-meat-ban-bmc-house-477).

So had those four not abstained, this measure would have been defeated at the first level itself. Seems like BJP did their math and trade well.

Edit 2: This is getting confusing:

&gt; If the BJP has its way, carnivores in the city will have to endure a dry spell later this month, starting August 22 and continuing till Ganesh Chaturthi. The party has asked Municipal Commissioner Sitaram Kunte to shut down all slaughterhouses in Mumbai for eight days from August 22 to August 29, to mark Paryushan, a ritual of the Jain community.

&gt; The party had made the same request last year, and even had its way, with slaughterhouses remaining shut for three days. Emboldened by last year’s ban, the BJP has demanded for an eight-day-long prohibition on slaughter-houses this year.

&gt; A letter was submitted to Kunte on Monday, to this effect. Other smaller organisations have also written to the municipal commissioner, asking for an eight-day long prohibition on slaughterhouses as well as butcher shops. They also want stern instructions to be issued to butchers that strong action will be taken against them, if they open shop in any of the days.

&gt; Not stopping at just a letter, the state’s general secretary and RSS man, Atul Bhatkalkar, BJP’s state vice-president Manisha Chowdhury and BJP’s group leader in BMC, Manoj Kotak, even met the civic commissioner.
Kotak confirmed that his party had sent a letter to the commissioner, saying, “We have asked the commissioner to strictly impose the eight-day closure on all slaughterhouses in the city.

&gt; Even last year, we had asked for the prohibition. **A three-day ban was accepted by the commissioner last year**.” The party wants this ban to be made an annual feature. Kotak added, “We are asking the slaughterhouses to be closed during Paryushan, as many Jains live in Mumbai and observe this festival. The commissioner has given us a positive response, but we hope that from next year onwards, he shuts down slaughterhouses of his own accord.”

&gt; According to a BJP source, the duration of the prohibition was increased from three days to eight with an eye on the approaching state assembly elections. “There’s a large population of Jains in many pockets of Mumbai. They are our voters, most of them are well-settled and don’t ask for major favours from political parties.

6641,"&gt; So what you are saying that these guys are so incompetent that they can't even control the municipal commissioner of the Council where they have majority for God knows how many years.

'Control' the Municipal Commissioner? Are you serious? A Municipal Commissioner is a senior bureaucrat, usually of the IAS cadre, and because the Shiv Sena has been in power in BMC state governments have always deputed people who have created maximum nuisance for the Corporation, by doing the bidding of the state government. In fact, devolution of powers to local self-government is a national goal we have been pursuing, but sadly haven't made much progress upon.

&gt; And don't lay this argument on me that state government has all the control over municipal commisioner, so they can't do anything other than be bystanders. I've seen them take to the streets for far smaller things.

Taking to the streets =/= 100% success rate. They have had to take to the streets *because* staid bureaucracy wouldn't accede. It's not hard too see state governments have had vested interests in making things worse for the Corporation.

&gt; For the record I am not for BJP, SS, Congress or any other political party on this issue. The ban is unjustified and state has no business interfering into the private lives of citizens.

You guys want to have the cake and eat it too! I clearly said at most a 4-day ban was okay as a measure of solidarity with Jains but extension to full eight or nine days is not acceptable.


Edit:

&gt; In 1964, in pre-BJP/Shiv Sena days two corporators proposed and got a one-day slaughter ban.

&gt; In 1994, another day was added to the ban. This time two BJP corporators were the ones proposing and seconding it.

&gt; In 2004, the state government’s Urban Development department issued a circular which added two more days for slaughterhouses to be shut down during the Jain fasting season. At that time the state government was under Congress-NCP control.

&gt; There is a bit of a “Gujarat model” going on here as well.

&gt; The problem with any ban like this is the precedent it sets. The court might have thought nine days was not an unreasonable compromise in Gujarat. “Out of respect, for their sentiments surely the non-vegetarians can remain vegetarian for 9 days in a year”.

&gt; That Supreme Court ruling specifically talks only about the “large population of Jains in Rajasthan and Gujarat”. But as we can see now what happens in Ahmedabad can easily cross over to Mumbai. And once we start going down the slippery slope an innocuous two days can become four can become eight can become…?

&gt; This resulted in huge public uproar, with people complaining about the poor illumination and the faulty electrical fittings. An overwhelmed BEST decided to conduct a referendum. The public voted in favour of the electric lights, but not before detailed discussions of the pros and cons and awareness drives by the BEST.

&gt; Residents and the nominated Sena corporator Avkash Jadhav also cited two books where the controversy over the lighting and the subsequent referendum finds mention - History of the Bombay Electric Supply and Tramways by Pestonji Mahaluxmiwala, and the Marathi book BEST Upakramachi Aatma Katha by Sainath Pendse.

Are you sure you're not mixing up dahi handi with some other festivals that feature processions?! Been to Mumbai during Marathons, Sunburn EDM gigs and matches at Wankhede?
 
&gt; Moreover, these processions/public celebrations are forcing their own religion/opinion on others, for example Muslims, who do not believe in the same custom.

Really?

Whether it is meat or liquor, the Shiv Sena is indeed more tolerant than BJP because the basic difference between them is that the former has primarily geolocal concerns while the latter identifies with a pan-regional religious cause that is rooted in their fascination of a *sattvik* Brahmin-Bania social order.

Like the user you replied to defended BJP, it could be also said of the Sena that any mention of them will conjure up imagery of protests against cricket matches or incendiary writeups especially in the minds of the likes of Rushdie or [Suketu Mehta](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/37j8lp/visiting_bombay_in_julyaugust/crnb5lm) or Shobhaa De, who found the post-Samayukta mill worker-type Sena responses too brash for their 'refined' tastes.

India is a difficult nation to rule, with a plethora of nations within this nation. The BJP, that clearly nurses ambitions of becoming the default *shatpratishat* party of governance, has to jump through hoops to work towards that goal. Because it also entails doing the balancing act between competing and sometimes adversarial interest groups - their infuriatingly countless flip-flops on issues like [statehood for Gorkhaland and Uttara Karnataka](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2opx9n/bjp_on_statehood_for_northern_karnataka_and/) are illustrative cases in point. Then there is the curious case of the legacy of Nathuram Godse - the BJP plays footsie with his admirers but avoids being seen as doing so, something for which his descendants have called BJP as 'unreliable' and 'two-faced'.

The BJP draws heavily from the Brahmin-Bania dominated narrative of how Bharat should be, while the Shiv Sena has been *primarily* concerned with a region of Bharat. Which is why the Sena is more accepting of the people of said region, be they [Konkani Muslims](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3c6htv/i_am_sorry_i_voted_for_bjp/csswxjh), or Christian East Indians. How many people know about Sabir Shaikh or [Champasing Thapa](http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai/close-aide-becomes-family-at-last-rites/article1-961220.aspx) or Abdul Antulay today? Because of the very fact that they largely represent the blue collar urban lower-middle classes, the Sena does not have the kind of resources as does the BJP which has the sympathies of the Sangh and the resourceful trading communities, which do ask for their pound of flesh in return, as BJP leader Raj Purohit told us a few weeks ago.

A sly party like BJP cannot be taken at face value - no matter what kind of a suave image they have managed to project, their fangs will be bared after they become sure they are firmly in saddle, like they did in Maharashtra:

&gt; In fact, differences between the two parties can be so intense that many Sena leaders believe that far from wanting to share power with the Sena, the BJP game plan is to use Thackeray's party to grow in the state and make a bid for power on its own at a later date. Says a Thackeray lieutenant: ""The BJP is using us to ride piggyback to power. We have become the shendis (tails).""

[Source: Thackeray's Sena scare, February 28, **1995**](http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/has-the-uneasy-shiv-sena-bjp-alliance-breached-the-congressi-bastion/1/288406.html).

It is understandable why Rushdie and ParanoidAndroid feel BJP was/is more 'accepting'; maybe a decade later they will be contradicted by someone who today is sitting in his Bhayandar home, wondering why mom said she can't make his favorite masala chicken for the whole week. 


[PS: Mr MyselfWalrus, there's also the undeniable fact that the BJP largely represents the ex-[Kushanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kushan_Empire#/media/File:Kushanmap.jpg) peoples in India which is why they're also called the cow-belt/northie/Hindi party. Like people elsewhere couldn't empathize why so many in Tamil Nadu had a lot of interest in the happenings in Sri Lanka, the rest of India has much lesser interest in relations with our Western neighbor as do the ex-Kushanians. BJP thus, remains the latter's best bet for 'normalization' of said relations which is why again, a fair assessment of their favorite party vis-a-vis Sena would be asking for too much.]",2015-09-06 18:07:26+00:00,cusnja7,5.0,t1_cushm2o,11833.0,india

6858,"&gt; I have had this doubt too for a long time. Let me explain, perhaps you can enlighten me. Its all anecdotal, that's why I am not confident you are wrong, or right.

&gt; I have always seen a higher need to give for charity among my community, Christians than among my Hindu friends. I personally feel that compulsion, that I got to help out the less fortunate, from beggars to orphanages to whatever.

&gt; However, as a general rule, I have seen my Hindu acquaintances ignoring stuff which I can't. There is a much higher acceptance of things as they are. Less of an impulse to charity. Say, less (christian) guilt.

Is it so that Christians have a compulsive feeling to help out the needy because of the religious indoctrination that the wretched need to be rescued from their misery? Can't help thinking of Mother Teresa who thought it was her divinely ordained duty to help the suffering (by preventing it's alleviation?!) Do your Christian friends secretly baptize in their minds, every needy person they help? Maybe because the dominant feature of story of Jesus overwhelmingly is suffering (and compassion, which the clergy has conveniently used to their ends).

&gt; Over time, I have come to suspect this is the karma theory filtering down into culture, and everyday life subconsciously. People's misfortunes just are.




 
&gt; For example, say conversion is completely banned. Absolutely banned. No Hindu can even go to a Church. Christians are expected to not mention Jesus or Bible or even display a cross in front of a Hindu for subconcious messaging. Still, Christians will run their hospitals, orphanages and whatnot. We can't help it. Call it the Christian guilt.

See, now because we're just building 3BHKs in the air, we're going to go nowhere if I too reply that charity too has been an integral feature of Hindu society. Just that the Christian marketing is way slicker.
 
&gt; Also, another question. Hindus are the vast majority in India, right? Do you really think, if the community wants, they cannot uplift every downtrodden Hindu? Just look at the money rich Hindus have, rich temples have. It can even be a great business investment, educating all the Hindu poor. But do we see a great focus on education?

Do they ask the same question in rich Western nations that have yet not managed to eliminate poverty? Why address Hindus as a monolithic entity when we all know Hindu society is so mindbogglingly diverse, marauding invaders over the centuries got bewildered trying to make head or tail out of it! Why assume all Hindus everywhere share with Keralites the same passion for education? Look at Hindu trading communities who emphasize business more than education - they're not doing bad!
 
&gt; Also remember the reservation debate is largely a debate among HIndus. Hindus who think reservation is unfair, vs Hindus who think reservation is fair. How many anti-reservation activists do you see proposing a comprehensive plan to bring all the lower-caste people up to their level socially, culturally, economically? Let us make sure there are no poor Hindus as a slogan?

How does any society on earth make sure there are no more poor people? Poverty is not a static concept, with elevation of living standards definitions of poverty change. No human society will ever be able to achieve perfect egalitarianism for considerable period of time.",2015-09-05 16:05:41+00:00,curl4xp,7.0,t1_curcr87,28431.0,india
6859,"&gt; There is no incentive in Hinduism to help other people. One's salvation(Mokhsa) in hindusim is strictly dependent on how well one performed one's Varna duties (Bhagvat Gita). And, performing other peoples Varna duties, contributes nothing towards Moksha(B.G)

Wrong! 

&gt;  One may amass wealth with hundreds of hands but one should also distribute it with thousands of hands. If someone keeps all that he accumulates for himself and does not give it to others the hoarded wealth will eventually prove to be the cause of ruin.

According to an October 2013 report by the state’s Planning Department, Marathwada’s per capita income is 40 percent lower than that of the rest of Maharashtra; that is even lower than in the Vidarbha region (27 percent lower than the rest of Maharashtra).

&gt; The report shows that Marathwada’s annual rate of growth in irrigated area is far below Vidarbha and the rest of the state. Per capita water availability in Marathwada is 438 cubic meters (cum), as against 985 cum in Vidarbha and 1,346 cum in the rest of Maharashtra. Water availability per hectare of culturable command area (CCA) in Marathwada, Vidarbha and the rest of Maharashtra is 1,383 cum, 3,627 cum and 9,173 cum respectively.

WTF! Could someone from Kerala elaborate on this?!


.

&gt; Simultaneously, there has been a rise in Hindu religiosity, on the lines of, and partly **in reaction to**, the Christian and Muslim revivalist movements that accompanied the remittance-fuelled affluence of these two communities.


That's usually the story elsewhere too.

.

&gt; The shakha today has 17 members, **including some Christians**..

&gt; For instance, the Sri Krishna Jayanti processions organised by Bala Gokulam, an RSS-leaning forum, have become increasingly popular in recent times. Anup and his friends started one in 2007 with 31 people; last year it had 220 people. **Some were Christians.**


So, like Roman Catholic Brahmins, Roman Catholic Kshatriyas and Dalit Christians, we now have Hindu Christians? Mohanji did say as residents of Hindusthan, we all are indeed Hindus.


.



&gt;  Accused by both Hindu and Muslim groups of ‘appeasing’ the other, and by caste associations of being hostile, the CPI(M) is in an unenviable situation. 

Probably this is why Dr Ambedkar refused to support initiatives to make India a strictly secular nation in true sense of the word - he instinctively knew Indians are a deeply religious people.

&gt; Lambasting inter-caste marriages, Idukki Bishop Mar Mathew Anikkuzhikkattil on Saturday stirred a hornet’s nest by saying incidents of Christian girls falling victims to ‘Love Jihad’ and the dubious agenda of the **SNDP** were on the rise.
Inaugurating the pastoral council meeting of the Kanjirappally diocese here, the bishop called for vigilance against such moves. According to him, inter-caste marriages were against Christianity which should be discouraged.


&gt; “Inter-caste marriages will spoil the purity and  characteristics of Christianity. Even if the government promotes such marriages, we should take care and discourage such tendencies,” he said.
He also alleged that Christian girls were being wooed and kidnapped by means of Love Jihad and the hidden agenda of (people belonging to) the **SNDP**. “Our girls are not hesitant to renounce Christian beliefs and leave their parents who brought them up while going with a Muslim or an **SNDP** member. This is because of the lack of a strong belief in Christianity.

See? How perceptions and concerns differ across individuals? This is why you should not expect everyone to be what you want them to be.

&gt; No, and I am merely calling out your bias.

You first comment sure hinted at something more than just that.

&gt; Irrelevant.

Relevant because the tenor of your comment was like that of a scorned ex-girlfriend.

&gt; They are currently in power - both at the state level (MH) and at the centre. Hardly qualify as underdogs anymore.

Aren't they underdogs on this sub?

That's just what you presumed.

&gt; I fail to see the plight of Shiv Sena or BJP.

They're yet to become India's default parties of governance.

&gt; I don't expect you to either understand or agree with my political views.

Good. I have my own personal political strategies I devised after much observation of how people behave IRL and in this community.

&gt; Calling you out on your bias is not a personal attack. It is a question that you have so far failed to address at any point in this thread - why is it that you find it so hard to criticise Shiv Sena. You can support them all you want - we live in a democracy and you are free to support any political party you want. Similarly, I am free to ask why can't you criticise them for the shit they pull?

You're a regular. I expected you'd know. On numerous occasions I have pointed out how theirs is a unique situation wherein they get disproportionate and often mischievously misplaced criticism; some of the regulars did agree. Will leave you to figure out the rest.

Did I give you my word on it and then go back on it, that you're so upset about it?! In my perception of a political landscape where 'secularism' ruled, parties like the BJP and SS were underdogs. Which is also when it came to choosing from between the two I chose to go with the latter. You don't have to be a Lankan Tamil or Kashmiri Pandit or a gay guy or a solitary techie wearing a skull cap going home after prayers who got beaten up to empathize with their plight.

7105,"&gt; According to Indo-Portuguese historian Teotonio R. de Souza, grave abuses were practised in Goa.[24] The inquisition was set as a tribunal, headed by a judge, sent to Goa from Portugal. The judge was answerable only to the General Counsel of the Lisbon Inquisition and handed down punishments as per the Standing Rules that governed that institution. The palace where the Inquisition was conducted was known to people as the fearful Big House. The Inquisition proceedings were secretive.

&gt; Fr. Diogo da Borba and his advisor Vicar General, Miguel Vaz had made plans for converting the Hindus. Under this plan Viceroy António de Noronha issued in 1566, an order applicable to the entire area under Portuguese rule:

&gt; &gt; I hereby order that in any area owned by my master, the king, nobody should construct a Hindu temple and such temples already constructed should not be repaired without my permission. If this order is transgressed, such temples shall be, destroyed and the goods in them shall be used to meet expenses of holy deeds, as punishment of such transgression.

&gt; In 1567, the campaign of destroying temples in Bardez met with ""success"". At the end of it, 300 Hindu temples were destroyed. Enacting laws, prohibition was laid from 4 December 1567 on rituals of Hindu marriages, sacred thread wearing and cremation. All the persons above 15 years of age were compelled to listen to Christian preaching, failing which they were punished. In 1583, Hindu temples at Assolna and Cuncolim were destroyed through army action.

&gt; ""The fathers of the Church forbade the Hindus under terrible penalties the use of their own sacred books, and prevented them from all exercise of their religion. They destroyed their temples, and so harassed and interfered with the people that they abandoned the city in large numbers, refusing to remain any longer in a place where they had no liberty, and were liable to imprisonment, torture and death if they worshipped after their own fashion the gods of their fathers."" wrote Filippo Sassetti, who was in India from 1578 to 1588.

&gt; In 1620, an order was passed to prohibit the Hindus from performing their marriage rituals.[25] An order was issued in June 1684 for suppressing the Konkani language and making it compulsory to speak the Portuguese language. The law provided for dealing toughly with anyone using the local language. Following that law all the non-Christian cultural symbols and the books written in local languages were sought to be destroyed.[26] Charles Dellon experienced first hand the cruelty of the Inquisition's agents.[27] He published a book in 1687 describing his experiences in Goa. L'Inquisition de Goa (The Inquisition of Goa).

There is nothing to conceal that Maharashtrians have generally loved whatever good the rest of the world world has had to offer. William Makepeace was a renowned and much admired India-born English author in his own right. The times of Prabodhankar in Maharashtra (the general area where Marathi was spoken then) were such that a [galaxy of reformist leaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Reform_Movement_in_Maharashtra) had created awakening among the laity. It is also pertinent to note that by the time Prabodhankar arrived on the scene, the first communal riot in Bombay city, that came there from Junagadh had already happened [1893]. The root cause was the Cow Protection programs which the Gujaratis and Jains were pursuing elsewhere which cause major 'disturbances' between the 'vegetarians' and Muslims. A wily Gujarati *setia* of Bombay started Cow Protection initiatives for Maharashtrians which ultimately led to a major backlash from the Maharashtrian labor force when the riots reached Bombay city, thus preventing major 'vegetarian' casualties.

Maharashtra was conceived as a reform-oriented state (*'purogaami'*) by largely Communist-inspired leaders of a region that was largely agrarian but also heavily industrialized. Small wonder then, that upper caste landlords of Goa that was initially slated to join Maharashtra, chose to stay a separate state in the Goa Opinion Poll, for fear of Maharashtra's land reforms. This is also why it was not only Marathis but also Sindhis, Jews, Muslims, Christians and other non-Marathis rallied for a Maharashtra state with Bombay city as it's capital!

In other words, a reformist, labor-oriented, agrarian Maharashtra was seen as distinct from a vegetarian, traditionalist, alcohol-abstaining, *setia*-dominated Gujarat. Which is why it is not surprising the Thackerays admired the best of the West, just like many other Marathis.

Now, SRK is a song-and-dance guy-cum-drama-queen who once [subtly played the Muslim card](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-17699074) conveniently when MNIK was about to be released; this when even someone the caliber of [APJ was mistakenly frisked twice](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/kalam-frisking-us-apologises-to-india-572058)! He was once expelled from Wankhede for misbehaving with security guards and was banned for some time. His calls for sporting ties with the enemy nation came while the wounds of the 2008 Mumbai attacks were yet fresh in public memory, and the nation was scaling new heights of secularism by contemplating bringing in a law that criminalized bystander Hindus and placed the burden of proving innocence on them, in cases of communal disturbances. No surprise the Shiv Sena slammed him.

A lot of secular-type apologetics spin how medieval Hindu-culling by non-Hindus was only political and not due to anything that had to do with religion. Seems like OP is doing the same with the issue of caste. He's probably hypothesized that discrimination of people against people within a society happens all over, just that in India it chanced upon the fault lines that ran along castes. Which makes caste not an exclusive causative factor but an associated factor in said discrimination.

Obviously, any discussion that is reminiscent of the British in India conjures visions of severe exploitation and thus, makes people here uncomfortable or defensive. Now, Mumbai is a city that is a unique meeting point of diverse cultures as /u/keyboard_dyslexic said, something no other city has managed to rival to date. Which is why there are always attempts to underplay the provincial character of the city by Indians themselves.


For example, the myth that 'Bombay' was derived from the Portuguese *Bom bahia* ('good bay') was refuted by the Portuguese, and there exist several centuries' old texts that attest to the fact that 'Bombay' was the European corruption of 'Mumbai' ('Mumba, the mother', a Hindu deity). The renaming of the city to it's original ancient and local name was not something uniquely unprecedented in the history of humanity or even India. People want to identify with their cultures, they want places they inhabit to reflect their pride in them, or even erase bitter associations with some names. This is one of the reasons why so many places across the world have undergone name changes, for example the [Derry/Londonderry name dispute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derry/Londonderry_name_dispute) closer to you!

However, a rough estimate shows that the officer had made a wealth of Rs 3 crore disproportionate to his income sources. He could not give a convincing explanation about the hard currency of Rs 23 lakh recovered from his house. Most of his financial dealings were in last two years,’’ sources said.

&gt; Vigilance had freezed Sooraj’s ten bank accounts and questioned him for several hours. His assets are in land and building. He has two warehouses and several real estate properties in many parts of Kerala.

Seems to have made a fortune. Consider this:

&gt;  Likewise, another clue investigators obtained was the transfer of Rs.600 crore to 40 banks in the district during 2001-2003. It was found that the funds that had been transferred to names of persons with fake address had been used under the guise of launching export business.

&gt; Speaking to The Hindu on Wednesday, Additional Director General of Police (Crimes) S. Anandakrishnan said the probe into the conspiracy angle required tough legal evidence. “Our terms of reference are to inquire the larger conspiracy, financial sources, national and international connections, and their ramifications,” he said.

7390,"You're just being naive. The SS has *absolutely* no friends in media especially in the English ones. Their statements get twisted to mean what they never intended to convey while more suave parties like AAP and BJP manage media to their advantage. Just today, I realized Arvind Kejriwal never apologized to Gadkari but somehow I was under the impression that he did and I don't even remember where I read it. That's the power of implanting ideas into the *ryot*'s heads! Consider this, one of the many lies media spun about the SS which got tremendous attention while the truth got buried in a Reddit thread: 
https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/303pnx/lgbt_need_psychological_treatment_sena_minister/

Secondly, there are differences in language styles of different sections of our society. The SS target audience is the one which gets swayed by articles sarcastically titled *vaacha ani gappa basa* - actually an exhortation to get up and do something! To a person brought up in the *Ganga-Jamuna tehzeeb* or who is in awe of the oratory of Vajpayee or Tharoor, it would make no sense! You just need to read critique of Jeff Kripal's work on Ramkrishna Paramahansa to realize how differences in culture and language sometimes are difficult to bridge and subtleties are often lost in translation.

You're free to disown them if you're ashamed of how and what they say.

Kids grow up - one becomes a rebellious gray character and the other, the quintessential mama's good boy. Rebel son is incredibly possessive of his mother, threatens moneylender and retrieves mother's pawned gold bangles. Mother gets angry and drives him away; he becomes a dacoit. Eventually, he tries to kidnap moneylender's daughter from her wedding when the mother - Mother India, has to stand the test of being not just a mother to the dacoit son, but a woman who treasures personal and societal values.

The final scene where a crowd witnesses the wrinkled and stooping figure of the once-beautiful mother inaugurating a water canal in the fields comes like an anti-climactic conclusion to a long story of her struggles - quite like how a battleship who has fought many wars triumphantly returns to her dock, confident and content that she played her part well.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; But I can't ignore that the amount of eve teasers within the islamic community is disproportionately high in ratio and they proactively target women from other communities with impunity and without fear.

Source for those lines? Like how I gave source for the lines I quoted?

&gt; You highlight the part where the poster admitted it that he does not know whether the rumours about the molesters being Muslims are true or not, but you forgot to the highlight the part where he mentioned this:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The islamic community seem to shelter their villains more proactively and celebrate it openly like seen in the case of the guy coming with reinforcements to kill the jawan

Well that was wrong on his part to have made assumptions on the basis of what he himself called rumors.

&gt; Doesn't fit your Shiv Sena approved bullshit rhetoric of all Muslims are bad, does it?

Source? 

&gt; The rest of the story is full of made up anecdotes intended to paint the Muslim community in a negative light. There was nothing more to that post than the classic Muslim hate that several individuals in this subreddit love to propagate.

As I said, there's no evidence to point out that post was made by anyone related to BJP. For all we know it could be made by AAP sympathizers who're known to use underhanded techniques like putting up fake posters, making unsubstantiated allegations (for which they get whacked in courts of law), and resorting to the filthiest techniques to malign political opponents as we saw in the recent Alka Lamba episode.

&gt; This is ""ahimsa"" over done. 

This fascination with absolute *sattvik* pacifism is the bane of Hindu society.

&gt; My Great Grandfather, a marxist student leader, pleaded and stopped a massive group of marathi youth from retaliating against muslims in 1946, after a group of muslim league rioters molested Hindu college girls at the Elphinstone college in Mumbai. 

This reminded me of the first ever communal riot, of 1893.

&gt; Interestingly, the Hindu landlords from Sindh, also supported Bhutto against the socialists (till the issue of partition was bought up).

A lot like how upper-caste Marathi landlords sided with the Catholics during the Goa Opinion Poll of 1967.

&gt; After my great grandfather stopped the mob, he was thanked by one of his wealthy muslim friend but he lost support from the Hindu textile worker class who had been in the receiving end of muslim league goons in Mumbai.

Pathan migrants from Afghanistan formed an influential part of the Bombay underworld long ago, and they were often used by mill-owners to intimidate workers into doing the former's bidding.

In their honor, India observes [14th April as Fire Services Day](http://mahafireservice.gov.in/Site/Information/sagaOfSacrifies.aspx), and there's a memorial dedicated to those firemen at the city's [Fire Brigade HQ at Byculla](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/Mumbai_Firefighters_Memorial.jpg).

7593,"&gt; one comment mentioning Hindu gods as fairer skinned ""aryans"" invading dark dravidian demons

There is the belief that the pre-Aryan (whether 'invasion' or 'migration') culture glorified dark-skinned deities like Shiva, that the interface with Aryans who had distinctly different traits and interests (nomads who valued livestock, especially bovines) necessitated a synthesis that resulted in the establishment of Vishnu (wily, protector of the *suras* - Aryans)  and Shiva (fiery appearance, straightforward, no aversion to physicality/sexuality, favorite deity of the *asuras* - the Dravidas) as equipotent figures of reverence. It was probably because of efforts on large scale that considerable overlap between populations which worshiped each deity began to occur - Adi Shankaracharya could have been one such similar figure.

Didn't forget anything.
 
&gt; 1) They found malpractices by hotels, not by the couples.

The Mid Day story leaves a lot of holes in the information it provides. It does not emphatically say hotels were not booked. If hotels were indeed not booked, we don't know if it is a strategic move to prevent long-drawn legal challenges as the crime lords wouldn't give up so easily.

Not everyone was booked under PITA - only three women were. Why not the rest? Surely something was amiss?

&gt; 2) They made the couples call their parents which is an unreasonable and illegal demand.

Technically, agreed. Strategically, probably good from the police's perspective to ensure parents spread the word which eventually impacts the business of such criminal-owned 'guesthouses'.
 
&gt; 3) They fined the couples. If mentally harassing them for five hours wasnt enough they extorted money from them for a law they didnt break.

Outraging just because it had to do with couples and alleged 'moral policing'? Driving without a helmet or getting into a streetfight will still see you having to put up with something similar.

&gt; 4) If this was to be a planned attempt to eliminate crime infrastructure, they should have caught someone actually breaking some law and put them behind bars. Instead they wanna round up people who dont get any privacy in a congested expensive place like Mumbai. Maybe the couples should have gone to carter road and made out in public.

You said you read 'most' of what I wrote, wish you read all of it. These criminals are apparently extremely resourceful and well-connected, and have not flinched from even legally taking on the cops! Operating within the constraints of our imperfect society, they have devised a strategy to cleanse a crime-infested area of antisocial elements that recently caused around a hundred deaths and threw their vulnerable families into utter despair.

&gt; India is not only a country of Hindus and Sikhs, but also, of Muslims, Buddhists, Catholics and Protestants. Most of India’s Christians are peaceful, but a major exception is the National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT). Active in the state of Tripura in Northeastern India since 1989, NLFT is a paramilitary Christianist movement that hopes to secede from India and establish a Christian fundamentalist government in Tripura. NLFT has zero tolerance for any religion other than Christianity, and the group has repeatedly shown a willingness to kill, kidnap or torture Hindus who refuse to be converted to its extreme brand of Protestant fundamentalism.

&gt; In 2000, NLFT vowed to kill anyone who participated in Durga Puja (an annual Hindu festival) And in May 2003, at least 30 Hindus were murdered during one of NLFT’s killing sprees.",2015-08-07 03:34:11+00:00,ctuf9ig,1.0,t3_3g37ej,92.0,india

&gt; Applauding the travel time taken for the live heart to be delivered in Green Corridor, he said, “Provisions should be made for a permanent green corridor in Mumbai, which will enable critical patients for immediate treatment. If traffic can be disrupted for VVIP movement, there can most certainly be one for critical patients in need of immediate medical aid.” 

&gt; Drawing focus towards the need to create awareness regarding organ donation, he said, “With the donor-recipient ratio being skewed in the city, there is a need for every Mumbaikar to understand the importance of organ donation and how it would help save thousands of lives. Every pledge counts.” 

&gt; Sukhmeet Sandhu, one of the hospital directors, said, “We are encouraged by the support we have received from the Minister of Health. We hope that with his continued efforts and support, we can save and enrich many more lives in future.

Err.. I meant to ask if even good social messages can be considered propaganda? Evidently not. Like O&amp;M used eunuchs to make an impact and drive home their point, what's wrong if governments deploy beggars as public service messengers. After all, they're everywhere!

&gt; Now is that not promoting the government's own selfish interest? That too on a regular basis. Not just 1 video. There are millions of other ways to promote their good message and schemes. They are exploiting beggars for crying out loud.


See, one of the problems in our nation is lack of knowledge. Many people are unaware of a lot of things that could go to make things better for them. For example, a lot of farmers are unaware of drip irrigation subsidy schemes of government. A lot of middle class people don't know the Centre gives subsidy if you opt for a solar water heater for household use. Hence, spreading knowledge of these schemes is a challenge in itself. And hence it is imperative governments try their best to popularize these schemes so their full potential be realized. Now, as long as we don't have a policy that we are going to something about beggars (which I doubt any previous governments gave any serious thought to), guess it is okay they at least do a bit in spreading public awareness messages.

7804,"&gt; by that logic I want 150 pages on Nayakars of Tamil nadu because mughals had 150 page. 

Why not? I mean, so many of us don't know much about say, the Cholas.

&gt; Havent i made it amply clear that mughals had a larger chapter because of their CULTURAL CONTRIBUTION.

That's like, your personal opinion only.

&gt; Yes. History is best when its objective leaving the readers to draw their own conclusion. Physical artifacts are some of the most objective historical things. Mughals simply left behind a richer heritage. EOS. Narrative can be made to fit anyones side.Maratha's contribution to admiistration and their peshwa system is more than well documented in the books. If you want to fap to maratha glory and bravery, go read some folktales. because at this point they are no more objective. The mughal army was led by a rajput jai singh in their clash with the marathas.

If Mughals contributed to culture and Marathas had a good administrative system what's to say culture should be given more coverage? There are a lot of documents pertaining to the latters' systems in some institutes in Pune. Why not try to mainain parity instead of getting carried away by 'cultural contributions'? There's nothing inherently great that makes Mughals' cultural contributions more worthy of study than those by other rulers in other fields. All the more because India has always been culturally rich, Mughals or no Mughals.

There were Muslims in the Maratha forces on good positions as well, so I don't see where you're going with that.

&gt; If you doubt what im saying you can always look up. all the maratha wars, they were not united. Holkars were the most powerful back then. Coward baji rao II allied with the english. Bhonsles allied with the french i believe. It was a huge cluster fuck with marathas. If you want your narrative to be glorifying the marathas sure. go ahead say that they were united all the time and fought for hinduism. But lay the facts bare and one can see the forced narrative.

You said:

&gt; There was nothing to be proud of them.

Which is why I asked you if you know anything about Hindavi Swarajya. But you keep repeating something about disunity like a broken record.

&gt; hindus fighting hindus? see marathas were no different from any other kingdoms. which is nothing bad. but pushing a false image is


So? If no Hindu fought another Hindu ever, you would still say Mughals were greatest because, cultural contribution. 

Mughal history is replete with family killings too, so that makes them less worthy of being proud of, no?

&gt; so much for hindavi swarajya. The marathas were pretty much the same base power grabbing rulers.

From where did you get the idea that Hindavi Swarajya excludes internal power plays?


&gt; Coming from madurai, I have seen my fair share of them. Let me tell you there is nothing spectacular about them. They were your standard 17th century buildings. Marathas were a bunch of warring chiefs. Barely had anytime other than fighting. I really dont expect them to excel at art.


My point was that despite Thanjavur being a blip on the Maratha Empire radar, they did enrich local culture in their own way:

&gt; Suresh will also be releasing a book on the history of the Tanjore Marathas, a clan that had been ignored in most Indian history books. ""They contributed to the art, architecture and culture of south India in a number of ways, but most of that is forgotten,"" he said.

&gt; ""They never destroyed an enemy's building, but preserved and expanded them, always using the same material used in the existing structure,"" said Suresh, citing the example of the Tanjore Big Temple in which the Marathas added a sub-shrine dedicated to Lord Nataraja.

&gt; The mistake you keep making is thinking of india as one back then. 

So you're saying there were differences amongst us that were as much as differences amongst us, and the invaders?!


&gt; Let me tell you as Tamil, rasktrakutas were very much hated down south. Chola kings made a career out of keeping the north of palar.

Was there as much hatred that translated into iconoclasm and genocide, as was there in the minds of the invaders that northern India had to countenance?

&gt; wasnt the caste system were the tribals were treated like shit were from this OWN land? is it justified to oppress the majority of the native people by the same hindus all right?

Do you really want me to go into what people belonging to different sects and denominations of other religions do to each other? Because what you're saying seems to be not an exclusive feature of Hindu society. Discrimination has always existed across all human societies.

&gt; Look , people did bad shit back then. that is because of the prevalent sense of morality. I wouldnt blame the hindus or the muslims. both did what was acceptable for their time.

Of course, but what's wrong in accepting the truth that Hindus were indeed culled in their own lands? It only opens the path to reconciliation.

&gt; hindus killed hindus , hindus oppressed hindus. nobody cares. muslims oppress hindus. everybody loses their mind. what kind of shitty bias is this? Remember why history has to be objective?

Hindus killed Hindus, we study about it. Ask for the truth about Muslims killing Hindus, everyone loses their minds. Why?!

&gt; lamest excuse ever. what religion were the people killed in thousands by ashoka at kalinga? the celebrated ashoka before settling down was blood thirsty maniac. after consolidating his empire he calmed down. Same with mughals.

Didn't Ashoka feel intense repentance for his act? And Mughals effin' gleefully documented their exploits as some sort of a stupendous achievement? See the difference why Ashoka is rightfully celebrated?

&gt; fsome final things to say.

&gt; when tipu was winning against the english in the thir anglo mysore war. Maratha fuckers allied with british inexchange for some land from british. shows the true nature of them

Tipu? Meh!

&gt; Tipu got Runmust Khan, the Nawab of Kurool, to launch a surprise attack upon the Kodava Hindus (also called Coorgs or Coorgis) who were besieged by the invading Muslim army. 500 were killed and over 40,000 Kodavas fled to the woods and concealed themselves in the mountains.[11] Thousands of Kodava Hindus were seized along with the Raja and held captive at Seringapatam (Srirangapatna). They were also subjected to forcible conversions to Islam, death, and torture.[12]

&gt; In Seringapatam, the young men who were forcibly circumcised were incorporated into the Ahmedy Corps, and they formed eight Risalas or regiments.[11] The actual number of Kodavas that were captured in the operation is unclear. The British administrator Mark Wilks gives it as 70,000, Historian Lewis Rice arrives at the figure of 85,000, while Mir Kirmani's score for the Coorg campaign is 80,000 men, women and child prisoners. In a letter to Runmust Khan, Tipu himself stated:

&gt; ""We proceeded with the utmost speed, and, at once, made prisoners of 40,000 occasion-seeking and sedition-exciting Coorgis, who alarmed at the approach of our victorious army, had slunk into woods, and concealed themselves in lofty mountains, inaccessible even to birds. Then carrying them away from their native country (the native place of sedition) we raised them to the honour of Islam, and incorporated them into our Ahmedy corps.""

&gt; The following is a translation of an inscription on the stone found at Seringapatam, which was situated in a conspicuous place in the fort:[14]

&gt; ""Oh Almighty God! dispose the whole body of infidels! Scatter their tribe, cause their feet to stagger! Overthrow their councils, change their state, destroy their very root! Cause death to be near them, cut off from them the means of sustenance! Shorten their days! Be their bodies the constant object of their cares (i.e., infest them with diseases), deprive their eyes of sight, make black their faces (i.e., bring shame).""

I'd say good job, Marathas.

&gt; Like i said if you want a pakistan style text book were ashoka is completely ignored and history starts with invasion of ghazini, again excuse me. Im glad indian books are throughly objective with (satish chandra books) where they clearly state for every inscription that glorifies someone, they give a caution that this is what we found and is probably some self praise. take it with a pinch of salt.

Pakistan textbooks are written from their perspective while ours are written from the dominant Leftist academic point of view. It is no secret the Left believes majoritarianism poses a greater threats than does minority appeasement. So there's that! This is why our history books are incredibly skewed against anything Hindu.

7808,"&gt; The universities and affiliated colleges in Maharashtra may soon have student elections as the Government has shown inclination to implement **recommendations of the Lyngdoh Committee.**

&gt; A delegation of students from 12 city colleges recently met Higher and Technical Education Minister **Rajesh Tope** with a request to restart the campus elections.

&gt; ""We are considering the matter positively and have no issues with recommendations made by the Lyndoh Committee. But we have to discuss the issue at the Government level before implementing them,"" Tope told PTI.

&gt; The state's universities stopped the polls since 1991 following violence and other untoward incidents in the campus. ""The polls are necessary for students to participate in political process,"" Vishal Chavan from Ruia College, who led the delegation, said.

&gt; The six-member committee, headed by J M Lyngdoh - an ex-Chief Election Commissioner - was constituted to reform student elections which often saw violence, money and muscle power. The panel submitted its report to Supreme Court in **July 2006**.

&gt; **The SC had directed its recommendations be implemented.**

TBH, I do think that the Marathas were downplayed. 


http://www.dnaindia.com/pune/report-ncert-cuts-short-shivajis-journey-in-std-vii-textbook-1830091


&gt; But anyway , mughals occupied a bigger chapter because of their cultural significance. 

So just after saying the Marathas were not downplayed, in the very next line you concede Mughals occupied a bigger chapter! Great!



&gt; Mughals were never praised in the books for their heroism. It was all about the music art, architecture and the general syncretism that happened. I dont remember marathas building grand buildings or inspiring a new system of music.

Is there a policy that 'culture' has to be given more importance than 'heroism'? 

Say, how much have you learned about the cultural contribution of the Thanjavur Marathas for example?



&gt; finally the marathas themselves were no single unity. Every clan was plotting agaisnt the others joining with the french and english. There was nothing to be proud of them.

What do you know about *Hindavi Swarajya*?

&gt; Also this thought that marathas were fighting against evil mughals is so fucking wrong. marathas were infact mughal feudatories inexchange for taxing rights. Do we call one side eveil when the pallavas and rashtrakutas fight? why does one want to call the mughals evil while marathas as the good?. Back then every body was fighting everyone else. Infact all the maratha clans themselves were at war.

The Mughals were a product of invasions of hateful barbarians that had in-built strong aversion towards Hindus. Their rule was instituted to keep Hindus subjugated. The Pallavas and the Rashtrakutas were products of this land, the Mughals followed a foreign ideology that was antithetical to the people of this land. So, there is no way the Pallava-Rashtrakuta conflict can be equated with the Maratha-Mughal one.

&gt; Also Mughals were not some evil plotters, the ghaznavids and the english were the looters and raiders. Mughals settled here. They made india their home. They wanted to run a stable empire.

The Mughals made India their home only after a long and bloody genocide of Hindus. How does it matter what Mughals wanted anyways? 


&gt; and saying leftists hate hindus is pretty stupid imo. leftists hate all religions. what makes you think a leftie wants sharia law?

The Loonie Lefties believe 'majoritarianism' is worse than minority appeasement. Which is why they always try to undercut the Hindus.


&gt; TL;DR : Marathas are given enough space given their contribution compared to mughals..


Pfft.. Political-colored spin.

If EDT, you may apply from a distance of at least 6 inches to pulse points like the base of the neck or inside of the wrists (don't rub), or clothing (many say it's inadvisable because EDT may stain or damage cloth fibers while on skin EDT eventually gives off a warm scent). To increase duration, apply after rubbing some moisturizing cream that itself doesn't smell strong (Nivea or even Vaseline petro jelly). Base of the neck is a good location because you can pull collars close to reduce scent, or like how the right person gets a nice whiff when you pull them close for a hug or more! Apply to chest if your EDT projects far so you don't announce your arrival or presence too loudly.

Dandruff is skin flakes due to dryness or infection. Better consult a qualified dermatologist - in either case, prompt treatment may help stop ongoing damage. If the weather in your city is humid and hot, you most likely have an infection and hair oil may provide more organic matter for the microbes to thrive especially if you have a dense crop. You may need to shampoo frequently but make sure you choose a gentle one - baby shampoos are good in this regard. If you have dry scalp, oiling will help by moisturizing the scalp.

&gt; Free tablets were distributed to 500 students invited from across India to the event. The government will be providing subsidies to students to bring the cost down to about **$35.**

&gt; The tablet, which has a seven-inch touch screen and 256 megabytes of RAM, will use the Android 2.2 operating system from Google and has two USB ports.

&gt; The Indian government pledged in 2009 that it would introduce a super-cheap laptop in order to **improve the quality of education** in the country through technology. Since then the project has been hit by delays and snags – critics called a first prototype **“nothing more than a souped-up USB memory stick.”**

So, Congress government planned to provide tablets to college students that were *subsidized* by taxpayer money, with no clear vision of what was going to be done with the tablets at all. Finally, we ended up with a tablet that froze often, the subsidy amount has likely been paid to the company that was previously unheard of, and there are numerous complaints that they never received the tablet at all.

*Sau choohe maar ke billi chaar dhaam chali*

Contrast this with the fact that the Sena's tablet initiative is with a very specific goal in mind - enable reduction in weight of schoolbags by transferring educational content from textbooks to tablets:

&gt; These tablets, manufactured by Mumbai-based e-learning company, will store all the text in one place, use audio-visual content and animation to help students retain information. Each chapter in the tablet will end with some tests for students and would help parents note progress of their wards. The development came a day after the Bombay High Court dwelled on the subject of heavy school bags causing ailments in children. A panel appointed by the State submitted its findings before a division Bench of Justices V.M. Kanade and B.P. Colabawala.

&gt; The 12-page report pointed out that 58 per cent of students below 10 years of age suffer from orthopaedic ailments caused by heavy school bags.

7932,"&gt; In 1894, Tilak transformed the household worshipping of Ganesha into a grand public event (Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav) in that house. The 
celebrations consisted of several days of processions, music and food. They were organized by the means of subscriptions by neighbourhood, 
caste, or occupation. Students often would celebrate Hindu and national glory and address political issues; including patronage of 
Swadeshi goods.[7]:152

&gt; The events like the Ganapati festival and Shiv Jayanti were used by Tilak to build a national spirit beyond the circle of educated elite 
in opposition to colonial rule. But it also exacerbated Hindu-Muslim differences. The festival organizers would urge Hindus to protect cows and boycott the Muharram celebrations organized by Shi'a Muslims, in which Hindus had formerly often participated. Thus, although the celebrations were meant to be a way to oppose colonial rule, they also contributed to religious tensions.[7]:152 Contemporary Marathi Hindu nationalist parties like the Shivsena took up his reverence for Shivaji.

Did Tilak instruct festival organizers to protect cows? 

See, there's background Katju has neglected to mention. Or more likely he doesn't even know it. The Junagadh town of Prabhas Patan had witnessed the massacre of Brahmins after  destruction of the Somnath temple in 1026, which Muslims upheld as a victory in their fight against idolatry. Centuries later, banias and Chitpavan Brahmins restored local temples. Probably wary of the rise of the former victims, Muslims were agitating to persuade the Nawab of Junagadh to stop 'favoring' Hindus in administrative services. On July 25 1893, Muslims attacked Hindus in that town during Muharram to avenge a riot earlier in Azamgarh. This conflict reached Bombay, and Gujarati *seth* Lakhmidas Khimji enlisted the support of mill workers who then attended a Gau Palana Upadeshana Sabha organized by Khimji. Eventually, things reached boiling point and..

&gt; Muslims did in fact commit the first violence. Armed with staves Muslims emptied out of the Jama Masjid and attacked a nearby Hanuman Temple whose bells and music were allegedly disturbing their prayers.

&gt; Many of the Muslims who participated in the rioting were not originally from the Bombay region.

When the Government of Bombay questioned the Police Commissioner's interpretation that the Gau Palana movement and Bombay Hindus' concern for what happened in Prabhas Patan was the causative factor, instead stating that news of the Patan riots might have 'exacerbated a predisposing cause', Muslims took this as an indication that they were losing influence and position to the Hindus.

On the backdrop of such violence, Vivekananda praised the relative peace-loving predisposition of Hindus but also exhorted Hindus to rise and be more martial than be 'like earthworms crawling at the feet of everyone who dares put their feet on us', and this was echoed by Bankimchandra Chatterjee, Surendranath Banerjee, Romeshchandra Dutt and Rabindranath Tagore. Tilak too was concerned at the turn of events - this was the first major Hindu-Muslim skirmish in Bombay region. Which is when he urged Hindus to learn from the Muslims who always make themselves heard in government. He exhorted Hindus to stop harping on soft measures and negotiate from a position of strength.

""Muslims had forgotten our long-standing friendship and started a regular campaign of harrassing Hindu mendicants that inevitably led to estrangement"", he said.

Also, it was Bhau Rangari and others who did more to popularise Ganeshotsav that was already being practiced in Pune. Because Tilak was the most towering leader of the region and also in the entire nation at that time, his name stuck more prominently to Ganeshotsav.

&gt; The Bill was opposed by many orthodox leaders who believed it as an interference in the Hindu religion. Bal Gangadhar Tilak opposed the age of consent. ""We would not like that the government should have anything to do with regulating our social customs or ways of living, even supposing that the act of government will be a very beneficial and suitable measure,"" Tilak vigorously protested.

Tilak was in favor of raising the age of consent but he did not want the British Government doing it; he wanted the Hindus to do it themselves.

In fact, Tilak urged social reformers to set an example for the rest of society, by marrying their daughters only when they turn sixteen, and their sons only when they turn twenty.

Now check out the Wikipedia entry about the Age of Consent Bill:

&gt; The Bill was opposed by many orthodox leaders who believed it as an interference in the Hindu religion. Bal Gangadhar Tilak opposed the age of consent. ""We would not like that the government should have anything to do with regulating our social customs or ways of living, even supposing that the act of government will be a very beneficial and suitable measure,"" Tilak vigorously protested.

That's all! Wikipedia might be an exhaustive repository of knowledge especially when it comes to topics on science and Western history but when it comes to the much contested and hoary history of probably the most invaded land of this planet, there's good deal of mischief and incomplete and/or inaccurate information there. For example, the Wiki on Mumbai now has conveniently omitted the part that says the Portuguese themselves now concede Bombay could not have come from 'Bom Bahia', but is most likely derived from 'Mumba aai'.  

&gt; This is the only thing that I can't find evidence for. According to online sources, Tilak opposed it because the government was undertaking repressive measures.


The British authorities brought in British soldiers to carry out sanitizing of Poona during which their behavior was [left much to be desired](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=De_ftH3bm-MC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=tilak+plague+women&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAGoVChMI88P4odWIxwIVCgaOCh2lPwew#v=onepage&amp;q=tilak%20plague%20women&amp;f=false). There were also allegations of rape of women being stripped for examination but those could not be proved for [lack of documentation](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=X4kUCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=tilak+plague+women&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBWoVChMI88P4odWIxwIVCgaOCh2lPwew#v=onepage&amp;q=tilak%20plague%20women&amp;f=false). 


Still, Tilak's writings and the assasination of Rand by the Chaphekar brothers made the authorities sit up and take notice, and finally they [conceded](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=X4kUCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=ipc+report+1900+Plague+Ports:+The+Global+Urban+Impact+of+Bubonic+Plague,+1894-1901&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PzdICxMpua&amp;sig=EtLRxlJcI-1ntKwVdYIkdzOgSnc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMIwejghteIxwIVTB6OCh0NQwY_#v=onepage&amp;q=ipc%20report%201900%20Plague%20Ports%3A%20The%20Global%20Urban%20Impact%20of%20Bubonic%20Plague%2C%201894-1901&amp;f=false) that the measures were indeed repressive, reduced powers of Plague Committees, made provisions for sensitization of healthcare workers to local customs and beliefs, and also provided for female doctors; echoes of this are found even today in India - it is customary for doctors to examine female patients only in the presence of another female. 


Tilak even built a Plague Hospital!

[Source](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=t3N7tT5kmOsC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;lpg=PA104&amp;dq=tilak+plague+hospital&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6Ivq_xpnJx&amp;sig=im_1pbqrr0Z5ZMwYptNS1J_OG8o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAmoVChMI6breh9iIxwIVVgWOCh2i_w1Q#v=onepage&amp;q=tilak%20plague%20hospital&amp;f=false).

&gt; Tilak wrote obscurantist nonsensical theories like that saying that the original origin of Aryans was in the Arctic

And the person who rules India's capital city today, and is looked up to by a section of the youth as a secular and forward-thinking role model, does not believe in modern medicine but [trusts homeopathy and fish therapy](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2efcur/til_kejriwal_doesnt_trust_the_modern_allopathic/). What's your point?! Some of our greatest leaders believed in ideas that were part of zeitgeist. Even Gandhi believed in the healing powers of mud packs.

&gt; After his 6 years in jail in Burma, he became an open British stooge, supporting recruitment for the British army in the First World War, supporting the Montague Chelmsford 'Reforms', 1919 etc

Thus, it is OP who tried to bring in the Mumbai riots issue in this discussion.

The very emergence of the Shiv Sena owes to the haughty and non-responsive attitudes of distant rulers who made promises only to break them - Congress once promised a Marathi state and then reneged on it. Then indulged in a lot of gymnastics to deprive Marathis of their deserved capital city. Which is why the Sena perfected the art of getting things done in their way. The tussle between pacifism and direct action is not a new one, it stretches long way into our hoary history and is also quite apparent among our own freedom fighters during the days of the Raj. Today, in the age of RTI and comparatively responsive governments it is easy to slam the Sena for not taking the path of unending *satyagrahas* to get things done in those times. Presentism. 

Had the powers that be, been responsive to concerns of the laity, the Sena would not have risen at all. If you're demanding punishment for the Sena for physical violence, will you also demand punishment for non-physical violence by the procrastinating higher-ups as well? And I'm surprised you associate 'constant bandhs' with Mumbai than Kerala or Bengal! And that too assuming there was no valid reason ever that necessitated a strike?! 


There was a reason devolution of powers from Centre to local self-governments was incorporated as a continuing aim of our systems of governance. I'll give you one example: for long there were demands from a lot of non-Hindi states that the RRB exams be conducted in state languages.

&gt; Communist leader Roza Deshpande gave me an example of how the Sena operated: 

&gt; &gt; The Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilisers (RCF) unit at Chembur had invited applications for certain posts. If the officials scrutinising the applications, most of whom hailed from Uttar Pradesh, saw the applicant was a Maharashtrian, they would tear the form and throw it into the dustbin. The Sena got to know of this. Sainiks got hold of all the the forms thrown into the dustbins, took them to the officials concerned and demanded an explanation. When the officials groped for a reply, they were beaten up. The next day onwards, the tearing-up business stopped, and Marathi youths started getting jobs at RCF.

What does being unique have to with anything here?

&gt; Can you show me a single person from Hindi heartland who speak Kannada, Telugu, Tamil or Malayalam even after living their whole lives in those south cities. Should we start beating them up too? 

When hatred for anything northern Indian manifests insidiously in [low-level antagonism](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/come-south-young-man-but-here-be-dragons/article2974594.ece), when it is part of a society, there's no need for a political movement - the job gets done by the average Joe on the street. The Shiv Sena was birthed precisely because Marathis were oblivious that they were getting shorted by migrants from other places. In fact, so inertial were (and are) Marathis, that the Sena's publication would title it's stories detailing migrants' misadventures as *Vaacha aani gappa basa* - 'read this and stay put', which was a tongue-in-cheek allusion to said inertia and a sarcastic exhortation to wake up and fight for their rights.





&gt; Don't support hooligans in the name of ""culture"" or ""religion"". Shiv Sena is India's own LeT and Bal Thackaray its Hafiz Saeed. Hope that motherfucker got a painful death. 

OTT exaggeration, political posturing evidently. Biharis have been bombed in Punjab, Hindis have been dragged out of buses and shot point blank in the NE, proponents of Dravida Nadu have spread intense hatred and propaganda against Brahmins, 'secular' national governments of India elevated to great positions people who went to great lengths to ensure foreigners learn exceptionally negative stuff about Hindus and who advocated using the 'wombs of Brahmin women to plant the seeds of the dark-skinned true sons-of-the-soil'!

8058,"&gt; Perhaps Narendra Modi is the only chief minister of Gujarat who had the courage to tweak the prohibition policy by allowing easier access to it in SEZs, visitors and business conventions so that the state could be friendlier to investment in other sectors, not alcohol. That triggered such outrage that even Modi was reportedly fazed. When 25,000 people, including a large section of women march from Gandhi Ashram to Gujarat Vidyapeeth to protest at any relaxation, he had to take note.

8100,"&gt; homosexuality was illegal way late into 20th century in USA. that does not mean they gave up on basic principles of equality in other spheres too.

The USA is not our master that we hold on to their apron tails. They have historically been a homophobic nation while we have always been more tolerant. Said law was a vestige of British rule on us and we should have thrown it out the moment they left but no, we persisted. Because we are not a modern nation at all.
 
&gt; korea/ Japan both had a untouchable caste/class, right till the time Ambedkar was alive. Google burakumin. So your point is wrong there too.

Here:

&gt; Affirmative action measures for Buraku people took effect under the Spe-cial Measures Law for Assimilation Projects (SML) of 1969 as a result of pressure from the BLL. Preferential treatment for Buraku people was justified as a temporary remedial measure until their education level, occupational sta-tus, and household income reach the national average, and prejudice and dis-crimination against them come to an end.

&gt; India is modern because it gives each person one vote. and justice is also given based on an individuals mistakes. Its not done based on what community he/she belongs to. but when it comes to jobs, thanks to Ambedkar, this basic principle of modern life, of individuality, is kept in the corner. 

India gives each person one vote but it does discriminate when it comes to when he wants to marry someone of the same gender. Or when it comes to number of spouses. It also discriminates on matters of succession, divorce, and administration of religious and educational institutions.

None of them have a history of suppressing a segment of their people for such a long duration of time, and none of them still carry the feudal tendencies we have developed over the centuries.
 
&gt; So as founder of that reservation system, Ambedkar is in my book the worst person. Cause he went and had the best western education, and then formulated a system that is anathema to the western-based principles ( of fraternity, equality), that the modern Indian republic is based on. 

Ambedkar formulated the system so that the privileged no longer continue denying modern education to the depressed.

And let's not even begin on how 'modern' the Indian state really is. A republic that still has separate laws for separate sets of people, and that declares homosexuality to be 'unnatural' and hence illegal while the rest of the world moves on from outright homophobia to legalization of gay marriages can hardly be called modern at all.",2015-07-26 16:46:25+00:00,ctgseu0,4.0,t1_ctgo87t,8785.0,india

8124,"&gt; That may be the case because they are a tiny party with a very small footprint, right?

BJP was once a tiny party, right? Did they ever disclose detains of their income then?
 
&gt; Their sole USP is anti-corruption. They don't have any experience in governance and their policies and vote bank is same as congress. So, if they aren't clean, there is no reason to support them. 

You have no idea how much BJP has alienated a lot of Indians with their sometimes-brazen policies. Of course people will continue to look for options. You cannot win everyone over with promises of materialistic progress. If that were the case, Hinduism would have been wiped out from this land long ago.

&gt; Fair question. AAP/JD/Congress/BJP all spend money in elections and we should require fully accounting and source of money from all of them.

Okay, but there's more to be worked out. AAP had support from a lot of middle class families that donated to them which is why they could leverage their strength in providing innocuous-looking account sheets. BJP largely has support from the trading classes and corporates, which is why donations to BJP will always be suspect, if they were made in lieu of promises of undue favors. That also leaves the question of parties that largely derive support from sections that are not financially well-off, they obviously procure funds in manners that certainly could be deemed less than desirable.

.

&gt; Translation:

&gt; The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Time I am, the great destroyer of the worlds, and I have come here to destroy all people. With the exception of you [the Pāṇḍavas], all the soldiers here on both sides will be slain.

&gt; Purport:

&gt; Although Arjuna knew that Kṛṣṇa was his friend and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he was puzzled by the various forms exhibited by Kṛṣṇa. Therefore he asked further about the actual mission of this devastating force. It is written in the Vedas that the Supreme Truth destroys everything, even the brāhmaṇas. 

&gt; As stated in the Kaṭha Upaniṣad (1.2.25),

&gt; yasya brahma ca kṣatraḿ ca
&gt; ubhe bhavata odanaḥ
&gt; mṛtyur yasyopasecanaḿ
&gt; ka itthā veda yatra saḥ

&gt; Eventually all the brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas and everyone else are devoured like a meal by the Supreme. This form of the Supreme Lord is the all-devouring giant, and here Kṛṣṇa presents Himself in that form of all-devouring time. Except for a few Pāṇḍavas, everyone who was present on that battlefield would be devoured by Him. Arjuna was not in favor of the fight, and he thought it was better not to fight; then there would be no frustration. In reply, the Lord is saying that even if he did not fight, every one of them would be destroyed, for that was His plan. If Arjuna stopped fighting, they would die in another way. Death could not be checked, even if he did not fight. In fact, they were already dead. Time is destruction, and all manifestations are to be vanquished by the desire of the Supreme Lord. That is the law of nature.

8203,"&gt; I know shiv sainiks hate Modi, but dragging him into every thread is just plain stupid.

It was a joke. A very, very civil joke. Can't you guys even tolerate jokes now?

&gt; Whenever I read your comments, I am reminded of Shiv Sena. A party with lot of potential - a party which had real grass-root level supporters and followers, a party which worked at grass-root level long before AAP came and made ""grass-root level work"" a fad.

Whenever I too read your comments I am reminded of BJP who promised us *Ram Rajya* which would be just and accommodating.

&gt; But, like the Shiv Sena - whose fanatical belief/disbelief in a couple of things - lead to their downturn (not out yet, only down).

Just like the cold, cunning, calculating, devious, insidious, oily-tongued, Janus-faced slimeballs that are the BJP whose many *jumlas* and manipulations have led to their grab at power.


&gt; So,it is with your comments.

So are your comments too.

&gt; Most of the comments are indeed very genuine and very helpful, and some are like these ;)

Quite a few Modi supporters too sarcastically make wisecracks on a lot of threads but never saw you pop in to tch-tch them.

&gt; Considering the fact that Thiruvalluvar's life has been fixed around the time of the Nanda's, that would make him only 50-60 years younger than Mahavira. The Jain caves in TN and other evidence suggests that the spread of Jainism happened much later, maybe in the middle Sangam period.

8252,"The very reason I mentioned Maharashtra in the national context instead of just talking about how many CMs Vidarbha has produced is, so it could be made clear that despite having nobody from Maharashtra become PM of India the state has progressed well. So why could Vidarbha not do the same despite giving four CMs?

Where do subsidies given over the years go? Into the pockets of people who were supposed to distribute the subsidy among the needy of Vidarbha. How is the fault of others if the contractors and distributors of Vidarbha usurp money meant for farmers? It is the people of Vidarbha who have to hold them accountable. Instead, it is these very people, who know they will get plum posts in a new Vidarbha state government who mislead the poor, ignorant people of Vidarbha into believing the former are their greatest well-wishers.

Vidarbha is in the rainshadow region but there is evidence of historical rainwater harvesting efforts which sadly are missing today. For example, if village-level representatives themselves [don't take interest](http://www.nagpurtoday.in/make-nagpur-dist-free-from-water-scarcity-urges-cm-fadnavis/05040929) in water management programs, what else can you expect? It is not only Vidarbha that produces power - Koyna produces hydroelectric power, Tarapur produces nuclear power. There are people who were [worse affected](http://infochangeindia.org/agenda/migration-a-displacement/the-mavlas-of-mulshi-displacements-earliest-victims.html) in our quest to build liveable frontier cities which is why the state is today counted among the best in India. And you just need to take a look at colleges in Pune and Mumbai, travel by trains from Nagpur and Amravati to Mumbai to realize how access to these cities on account of being part of one state has benefited Vidarbha in a way that has to do with not agriculture, but with being part of the new economy.

Marathwada is in a worse situation than Vidarbha, but you never see wails for statehood from there. Why? Where's the 'development' rationale in their case?

8386,"&gt; new lights give better visibility

Really?! Because..


&gt; The lack of illumination on the Marine Drive promenade has left walkers and regulars, especially women and the elderly, worried for their safety. The problem arose after the BMC suddenly decided to change the lights on the stretch from sodium vapour to white LEDs.

&gt; Mirror has been highlighting the ad hoc manner in which the civic body has changed the lights. On Monday, Mirror had reported about how an illumination survey exposed that the sharp focus of the LED lights have resulted in several dark spots on the road. Further, the illumination does not even reach the promenade, while the yellow light's glow used to extend till the sea.

&gt; Besides the aesthetics, the change has led to safety concerns too. Women walkers said they are afraid to step out for their pre-dawn walks due to safety concerns. Worse, resident associations said even BMC sweepers have complained to them that they take more time to clean the stretch due to visibility issues before sunrise. ""It gets scary if you are alone,"" said Grant Road resident Roma Singh, 30. ""There are stretches that have trees on the sideways and they are the worst. The previous lights were brighter and you could walk comfortably."" Singh a resident of Grant Road is walking on the stretch for past six months.

&gt; Another woman walker who requested anonymity said her husband has advised her not to go for walks before sunrise due to the recent change in the lights. ""I walk near the roads just so that I can see people clearly. I stopped taking up early morning and late nights walks for safety issues.""

&gt; The Porbunderwalas, a family from Mumbai Central, are pissed off that the BMC chose to tinker with the most perfect road in the city while there were so many that are crying out for illumination. ""You see shadows everywhere and people are susceptible to thefts and bag-lifting,"" said Vishar Porbunderwala, 58, who comes to Marine drive with his wife, daughter and granddaughter. ""The area is safe, but the dark stretch should be lit for safety of walker especially women.""

&gt; **Anil Bhati, Honorary Secretary of Marine Drive Council of Association**, said, ""There are plans to install CCTV on the poles to monitor traffic and crime. In the current state nothing will be seen on the promenade and footpaths in CCTV. Couples sit on tetrapods so do drug addicts. How will one secure these dark areas? **Previously the lights were enough to secure the 10 feet footpath and 4 km stretch.""**

&gt;  According to BEST president Arvind Dudhwadkar, LED lights along Marine Drive only produce 60 lumens and are directional so **not enough light reaches the footpaths.**

Because this identity is such an important aspect of their lives, bet they eventually do come to be aware of their history. 

&gt; They can't abuse their power if that is indeed the case.

As I said earlier, they were said to be given a boon by Lord Rama, and thus subsisting on handouts from society became an important if not the only means of sustenance for them. Now, as times are changing people have begun to question the legend behind their almost-holy position; as the article I linked earlier says, now people don't call them for their blessings on auspicious occasions as in the times gone by, and quite a few people tell them to bugger off when asked for money. What do they do then? Becoming more persistent and bold in their approach to potential donors is what they probably devised to survive in a rapidly changing India. Also, there are even instances when non-hijras dress up as hijras and beg in local trains, thus bringing in more competition to the real ones! More than these guys, it is babas who ask to have sex with young daughters of devotee families or money in return for divine favors, who abuse their power.

Don't be afraid or contemptuous of hijras, they're part of our legacy as an organized and just Hindu society wherein everyone had a designated place and the right to live with dignity. As others here have said, *talk* to them as a fellow human being, and if you don't want to give them any money tell them so.

As a side note, maybe you'll find it interesting that in quite a few Bollywood movies, they're often portrayed as the quintessential good guys with hearts of gold.

This:

&gt; The vernacular in Telangana region was a different dialect(s) as you would expect of any spoken language in any state. There was literature in Telugu in the form of poetry written all over South India until 18th century. When the composition of works and newspapers in spoken language started, it was heavily influenced by the people in the delta areas of what is now Andhra Pradesh since there was more literacy . The codified language was close to what they spoke. For example, the word endings, the vocabulary etc. The State of Hyderabad had significant numbers of people who spoke four languages (Marathi, Kannada, Urdu and Telugu) which influenced the local vocabulary.

&gt; When the state was merged in 1956, the standardized language was that of the Andhra state was use in education and media. However the local vernacular of Telangana was mostly used for comic purposes in the media. Also, the mingling of the people meant that Telangana people were being told that they don't speak ""pure"" language and the words they were using were not ""correct."" This happened more so in Hyderabad since there was an influx of people from Andhra (being capital and all). Example.

&gt; The resulting resentment added to other grievances of the people from Telangana.

[Yugandhar](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12839928-yugandhar) by Shivaji Sawant, because the central character of India's greatest epic was so layered and complex, no television series can do complete justice to it.

[Mrityunjaya](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6369447-mrityunjaya) by Shivaji Sawant, because it is refreshing and revealing to look at the Mahabharata from Karna's perspective.

[Shriman Yogi](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6727757-shriman-yogi) by Ranjit Desai, because it is a dramatized version of the story of a warrior who infused the desire for *Hindavi Swarajya* into a people who had resigned to their fate under a tyrannical rule, and laid the foundations of one of our nation's greatest empires ever.

[Yayati](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7607918-yayati) by Vi. Sa. Khandekar, because this work by a [Jnanapith Award-winning](http://www.tribuneindia.com/2008/20080406/spectrum/book2.htm) author is a reminder to us all, how relentless pursuit of material joy ['Yayati Syndrome'] is worthless, unless tempered with spiritual purpose.

[Shyamchi Aai](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13271546-shyamchi-aai) by Sane Gurujee because it is a an autobiographical account of the life of [Pandurang Sane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandurang_Sadashiv_Sane), a freedom fighter of the Civil Disobedience Movement, who started the Antar Bharati movement to promote learning of Indian languages by Indians, himself learned Bengali and Tamil and translated Kurul by Thiruvalluvar into Marathi, and among other things was associated with the Communist cause till the 1962 War for workers' welfare, was opposed to RSS and allied organizations and went on a fast to get the gates of the Vitthal Temple at Pandharpur opened for untouchables. The book deals with how the protagonist's mother deals with questions and moral challenges her child poses - the story was also made into [a movie](http://indiatogether.org/mother-reviews) by the doyen of Marathi literature, Acharya Atre. The movie went on to win the first ever President's Gold Medal for the All India Best Feature Film in 1954.


[Yuganta](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/961520.Yuganta) by Irawati Karve, because it 'studies the principal, mythical-heroic figures of the Mahabharata from historical, anthropological and secular perspectives'.

[Batatyachi Chaal](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12374910-batatyachi-chaal) by Pu. La. Deshpande, because it is one of the best and most memorable works of this author well-known for his self-deprecatory and wry sense of humor.",2015-07-11 13:08:17+00:00,csznquh,1.0,t3_3cw8hd,17513.0,india

8489,"&gt; Homosexuality by contrast is extremely materialistic and therefore selfish in its goal.

How is homosexuality materialistic? How is materialism bad?

&gt; Which is why it's considered one of the great sins in Hindu society. If you are marrying, you are underestimating the commitment involved.

So our PM is a great sinner according to Hindu beliefs?

&gt; Whose intentions were certainly not goodwill. The example of Valmiki convinces me Hindu society would have reformed outside of foreign influence. Now it's been raped, brutally raped.

Perfectly sane people of good standing within Hindu society sometimes defended ideas that would be considered abhorrent today. So yes, people with lot of goodwill too at times came across as not approving of reform. Which is what might be the case with homosexuality as well. Good people don't always have the best opinions.

&gt; Ask a Muslim or Christian to marry outside their religion and tell me if they aren't considered apostates. You'd be daft to think people of different social classes can marry very easily in another religion. It's impossible. 

Why should I be okay with aberrations in my people just because they exist in other people as well? If Muslims and Christians don't give any credence to the idea that the cow is a motherly animal because she literally feeds us like her child and actually kill her to eat her flesh, can that serve as a justification that some Hindus do it too? Wouldn't you expect Hindus to be exceptionally sensitive to this belief and desist from killing cows despite what Muslims and Christians do? I believe you would. Then why would you seek to justify the marriage thing by citing similar phenomena in other societies? 

&gt; The luxury of Industrial Revolution and society of excess affords it. That is not a weakness of Hindu religion. Till about a few centuries back, there was an ENFORCED caste system in Japan. And the principles of varna priority STILL exist in Japan. Your occupation demands the respect you are afforded. People always choose others of similar flock. This is THE natural flow of life.

Aren't restrictions placed artificially on unions between people not against natural flow of life?

&gt; There are other ways to solve the problem of population other than legalizing homosexuality. 

What? Nobody is demanding his gay rights because this can solve the overpopulation problem!

&gt; By doing that, you aren't even attacking the right flock of people and sending an extremely cancerous message of encouraging selfishness in society.

Again, denying someone to live a dignified life with whoever they love because the mere existence of their union appears threatening, is selfish in the first place.

&gt; Don't SPOIL people is the more realistic solution. 

Not inconceivable similar arguments were put forth when interracial marriages were legalised and caste barriers were broken down.

&gt; Of course, nothing much can be expected of governments which masturbate to the poor. The spoilt poor are the greatest reasons for population increase. Low quality stuff bhut hai India mein. Homosexuality is even less quality. These Fuckers hate life. If they didn't, they wouldn't be homosexuals or identify as such.

How do homosexuals hate life?

Good idea!

&gt; In the North Hindi is in the Syllabus so that is 1 option down. But that again for non-Native Hindi speakers should be treated like English. Meaning no need to speak them at home but learning them is better. Just treat them as lingua franca.

What about the native Hindi speakers of the northern part? Which third language should they learn?

&gt; Meaning the argument 3 languages are too many to learn(some use this line of rhetoric) is utterly moot. Indians are as a matter of fact at the basic minimum already trilingual if not more.

Aren't almost all northerners bilingual?

Can you imagine what it must have taken for him to hold his own against the combined might of the Central government, the secular intelligentsia and, a pliable and hostile media?! And we're not even talking about detractors within his own party! People who grow up weathering extreme challenges, after a certain point achieve considerable heft in their respective fields, and they become very adept and intuitive at problem-solving. The current events are just his way getting cleared so he can get a free hand later - as if the Modi-led system is undergoing catharsis.

As for the Dear Leader scenario, I think our setup has enough artificial and non-artificial safeguards that will prevent a virtual takeover, so rest assured nothing disastrous will happen. What needs to be guarded against is, as a nation we are ridden with multiple faultlines which makes us an incredibly difficult people to deal with. We often have had trouble staying united, and internal squabbles have historically worked to our disadvantage. IMO the PM needs to factor that in and if he manages to build bridges amongst people, we surely are going to work our collective way out of the morass we seemed to have headed into.

&gt; &gt; The Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilisers (RCF) unit at Chembur had invited applications for certain posts. If the officials scrutinising the applications, most of whom hailed from Uttar Pradesh, saw the applicant was a Maharashtrian, they would tear the form and throw it into the dustbin. The Sena got to know of this. Sainiks got hold of all the the forms thrown into the dustbins, took them to the officials concerned and demanded an explanation. When the officials groped for a reply, they were beaten up. The next day onwards, the tearing-up business stopped, and Marathi youths started getting jobs at RCF.

&gt; The cool, rainy and breezy ambience was suddenly shattered around noon when several hundred Muslims, attired in Pathan suits, dancing and playing huge drums, turned up to greet the 'prince' at the Matoshree gates.

&gt; ""My members and leaders came from all over Maharashtra to wish Aditya on his 25th birthday... The music and dancing was our way of conveying our love for him,"" Haji Arafat Shaikh, president of the Shiv Vahatuk Sena (SVS), the Muslim face of Shiv Sena, who led the musical procession to Matoshree, told IANS.

&gt; Later, the visitors were treated to a lavish spread of lipsmacking vegetarian and non-vegetarian biryani, pedhas, barfis and sweetmeats besides other tasty cuisine for which they hungrily awaited their turn in snaky queues.

&gt; Earlier, the SVS organised a 'chadar' laying ceremony and distributing sweets at the Haji Ali dargah in Worli, followed by a special 'maha-aarti' at the famed Siddhi Vinayak Temple in Dadar before proceeding to greet Aditya.

&gt; SVS activists fed beggars at the Mahim dargah, and in Chembur and Pune, distributed laddoos to people in Shirdi, launched a year-long autorickshaw training scheme for women in Thane, and similar other celebratory programmes in 16 districts across Maharashtra, Shaikh said.

Presumably because it thus neutralizes power centers in Maharashtra BJP and makes things easier for Fadnavisji and Modiji.

Messages to this effect have been doing rounds of social media websites and their authors allege that Fadnavis has been pushing all his rivals within the BJP to the wall to cement his place in the top office. The trust deficit among the contenders for the CM’s post has been there since the beginning, but it has now broken through the party’s walls and come into the limelight.

.

&gt; Another recent development that points to an intense intra-BJP war is the emergence of a video which allegedly has the party’s Colaba MLA, Raj Purohit, tearing into several members of the BJP. If the video is to be believed (Purohit has asked for a forensic test) then one can infer that most of the elected members in the BJP, in the Centre and the State, are not happy.
*It also highlights the money power being used by certain members of the party.*

OTOH you're fine with anecdotes 'ruling' discussions?

&gt; Nothing of that sorts. They were perfectly happy with Hindi being one of the languages, and didnt even knew rudimentary marathi. Their parents too spoke only when relatives arrived.

Why would they not be happy with Hindi? Seems you've started off with a very flawed presumption that Marathis hate the Hindi language per se. Would like to assure you that is *not* the case. For example, public perception notwithstanding even the pro-Marathi Shiv Sena has always argued for [not disrespecting](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=jsoxXeEH_6IC&amp;pg=PA484&amp;lpg=PA484&amp;dq=shiv+sena+national+language&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=n_cKmDvC6d&amp;sig=P46OPvpjq2wlJmIBkb6d5AB4zzw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2tuIVeq_MJShugTus4LQBA&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=shiv%20sena%20national%20language&amp;f=false) Hindi.

This is not about whether Marathis 'like' the Hindi language or not. This is about respecting the language and culture of any place one chooses to migrate to.

&gt; You need to move around more, and maybe make more marathi friends who live out of the state. I have seen this and speaking with experience. While availing domicile for a college, he looked all lost when one of the form i pulled out had Marathi stuff written, and i asked him to tell me which alphabet is which.

Again, anecdotal. Whereas I have provided links to support my contention Marathis have largely adapted to local cultures wherever they settled. 

&gt; Quite honestly.. What part of me being a NON NATURAL HINDI SPEAKER you dont get? 

Who said I didn't get that?

Source for the claim?

&gt; in the same way that Goa was given the vote and voted to stay independent of a Marathi speaking state.

Goa was complicated by some factors: upper caste *zamindars* were skeptical of Maharashtra's progressive land reforms which is why they did not want to join Maharashtra, and the powerful Christian lobby too was apprehensive of joining Maharashtra for fear of their influence getting diluted. So, the latter started championing the cause of Konkani (which they were trying to undermine and promote Portuguese), till then considered a dialect of Marathi and created a Marathi-Konkani divide.

&gt; Neither side benefits. The two political cultures are too different and have different needs. The needs of the city aren't met by politicians who come from completely different lives. The beef ban makes sense in Maharashtra, the alcohol laws make sense in Maharashtra, the language laws make sense in Maharashtra, they make no sense in Mumbai. That is just a start.

&gt; The Samyukta Maharashtra Movement is built around the idea that Marathi speaking peoples should be with each other in one state. 

Was it built around the idea that non-Marathis should be excluded from the state? And, not like only Marathis were part of the Movement. 

&gt; The people of Mumbai are no longer majority Maharastrian, in fact I've read it's as low as 20% now, and have the right to form their own state built around their language and government needs. 

Who has given them this right?

Maharashtra is the most urbanized state of India. People from the rest of the nation are constantly pouring in and settling down in cities and towns other than Mumbai. Today you're arguing for Mumbai, it could be Pune in a few decades! Hence, it is well within the rights of Marathis to plan for the integrity of their state and create conditions so that settlers assimilate and not consider themselves not part of the state. Which is what this submission is about.

&gt; No one cared that the city's name was Bombay when the city was majority Maharastrian. It was only changed way after the city was minority Marathi Manoos.

[Marathis are the largest linguistic group in Mumbai](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Mumbai#Demographics).

&gt; Forcing non-Marathi majority Mumbai to stay with Marathi majority Maharashtra is making both sides unhappy and weakens both. The city needs to go its own way.

*'Events and new possibilities can affect existing rights or require new ones. Advances of technology, medicine, and philosophy constantly challenge the status quo of human rights thinking.'*

&gt; The ICPD Program of Action in paragraph 7.2 “defines an individual’s sexual and reproductive health as complete well-being related to sexual activity and reproduction. Sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) encompass both entitlements and freedoms. This includes the definition of reproductive rights in paragraph 7.3 of the ICPD PoA, which clarifies that these are not a new set of rights but human rights in existing human rights instruments related to sexual and reproductive autonomy and the attainment of sexual and reproductive health.  Additionally, the 1995 Beijing Platform for Action (PfA) expands this definition to cover both sexuality and reproduction by affirming in paragraph 96 the right to exercise control over and make decisions about one’s sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence.”

&gt; Sure they can fuck how much they want but don't expect anyone to acknowledge their relationship as normal. You can't force others into thinking what you want.

That's not how things work. Untouchables marrying Brahmins was once thought of as an abomination. Women going to school was considered outrageous. Even the *sthapana* of Lord Ganesha outside of the home, in the gully, was considered despicable! But finally, things changed for the better, sense prevailed and we saw merit in changing with the times. Maybe nobody will be able to change your attitude towards their fight for their rights. But one thing is for sure, times are changing. We are moving away from the Abrahamic-inspired sense of shame in our rational belief systems that has always taught us to accommodate. (The Western duality of good God-bad Devil simply appears childish compared to Hindu concepts like *nirgun nirakara* which at a very basic level makes it easy for our society to assimilate and cultivate a bewildering array of lifestyles and traditions. And like it or not, this has been our greatest strength which befuddled and bedazzled all those who came to conquer and subjugate). The coming generations will surely be more open and receptive than hateful people who still have a chance to change and adopt a more humane perspective on human relationships, or sadly and angrily take it to the grave. These are the machinations of *kaal*, nobody can escape it. The world is changing and we have to keep up.

&gt; Regarding India, how do you know that the depiction on the temples were not supposed to represent sins? Is there any reference to acceptance of homosexuality in India in any book or research paper? I don't think it was widely accepted. 

Here:

https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=LGBT_themes_in_Hindu_mythology#Same-sex_sexual_interactions

http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/jul/02/gay-rights-india

&gt; Pantheism has got nothing to do with this, this is about the quality of our race and people, and in every higher culture feminine men, sodomy and homosexuality correspond to decline of that culture.

It is not 'feminism of men and sodomy', but idiotic pacifism arising out of a moronic fascination for anything purely *sattvik* that did Hindusthan in. Read up on why Sindh was badly mauled under the reign of Raja Dahir. Every society needs people of different balances of the three gunas, doing their jobs of keeping things going. Warriors need to fight. They need not be sensitive individuals too clued in to the aesthetics of *ahimsa*, that is for the pursuers of knowledge and the traders because they need to keep their minds calm and focused. Being gay has nothing to do with being feminine. You'll be surprised a lot of gay guys are way more macho than heterosexual males, while not all guys who act feminine are into guys. 
 
&gt; On the contrary I'd say that developing a culture suppressing degeneracy is what made European and Islamic civilizations prosper in the past. Current world scenarios are not a proper depiction of those civilizations at their peak. Today's world is more influenced by western liberal ideas from America and American culture in one way or another. Even the Afghani people were more progressive before the war and we know about the funding of extremist Wahhabism through petrodollar money. Western liberalism is also killing native European values which made them prosperous throughout last millennium.

No. Because by that logic, the Dark Ages of Medieval India should have made us incredibly powerful. But we got overrun again, and again, and again. Suppression of homosexuals does not make any society strong. Only societies anxious of their prowess do that. Nations at peace with themselves don't curtail basic freedoms of their own people.",2015-06-21 18:08:01+00:00,csdz5fd,9.0,t1_csd4mq2,81859.0,indianews

During times gone by, it was forbidden to enter into marital relationship with someone of the different *varna*, caste or race.

[Facts About Homosexuality and Child Molestation](http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/faculty_sites/rainbow/html/facts_molestation.html)

&gt; They are sexually more pervert because women in heterosexual relationships are usually gatekeepers of sex.

'Pervert' is relative as define by acceptance of what constitutes the 'norm'. Women can be perverted too. Here, this is what is said of women in some of our texts:

&gt; Women do not care for beauty, nor do they care for age.  Whether the man is handsome or ugly, a woman will enjoy him.

&gt; Knowing this disposition, created by Prajapati, a man must make the greatest of efforts to protect a woman.

&gt; When thinking of women, Manu gave them a bed, a seat, ornaments (implying love of these), desire, anger, dishonesty, malice and bad conduct.)

[Source](http://themotherindia.com/2013/02/13/sanskrit-tidbits-28manusmriti-and-position-of-women/)

The gatekeepers of sex, you say?!

&gt; Look up bug chasers. They are people who are excited by getting and giving aids to others.

Are you digging up the worst of gay subcultures to paint all of them with the same brush? Really, should we get into this? We could discuss the most horrific aspects of the hetero world and slam all of them too.

&gt; Look up poz culture. Similar thing as above

Again, not a valid argument.

&gt; For fags, the world revolves around their sexuality. For them it's important everyone around them accepts them. Look at gay parades and the degenerate ways they dress up during them.

Because we refuse to accept them for their sexuality, thus making it the most important aspect of their lives. Like how caste was once the most defining characteristic of one's identity and now at least in the metros nobody cares anymore because we have moved on from according it any importance. Similarly, if we were to accept them for what they are, sexuality will cease to matter so much.

&gt; Fag parents are more likely to abuse their kids and fuck up their sexuality and upbringing. There are books about this and I can link to them if you want.

Do divorced parents bring up their kids as good as their married peers?

&gt; Lastly, it is not what nature wants and most religions and personally i find it disgusting. Men weren't born to be feminine. Accepting faggots is a step in the wrong direction. It is traditional gender roles that have built society. Accepting lgbt nonsense is moving away from this. Also, if it's a choice, it's a defect like having a genetic disorder. Don't let these people breed. But that's if there is a choice in the first place. There are many cases where kids who were sexually abused as children grew up with extremely weird notions about sex, fag being one of them. 

Ah, *this* is the root cause of your hate for them. That you simply don't like them and you just search for ways and means to justify your hate for them, and clutch at any straw that might seem to bolster your case. When Hindu philosophic thought has such profound concepts as *Ardhnarishwara* and that even *Maryada Purushottam* Ram accorded people of the third gender a position of respect during Ram Rajya, there remains no religious basis in Hinduism for anyone to hate so much on them.

9114,"&gt; Yeah, the names, Mumbai and Bombay have different origins. One isn't a variation of the other. I don't understand how that can be even compared to Ramzan/Ramadan.

No. 'Bombay' was a corruption of the name of a Hindu deity. The notion that the name was derived from *Bohm bahia* today stands disproved by the Portuguese themselves. The reason I am engaging in this conversation with you is because when it comes to 'Mumbai', you argue such issues are superficial, and don't amount to much and that you don't care. But seems like Ramadan/Ramzan has gotten quite a share in your mind space. Like 'parantha' and 'Karela' bother you.
 
&gt; It's not my problem if some North Indians are dumb and take pride in it too.

Not saying its' your problem. Saying that northies not spelling it right does bother you that you rush in to correct them. 

&gt; Umm, no. What you say is plain stupidity.

You're missing the bigger point. That names, spellings often get twisted when they encounter a people not familiar with them. Which is what evidently happened to 'Mumbai'. Which you seem to think not much of, and yet cannot tolerate someone misspelling your parotta or Kerala.",2015-06-19 13:38:11+00:00,csbtpx2,5.0,t1_csbr9ty,6382.0,india
9115,"&gt; A widespread explanation of the origin of the traditional English name Bombay holds that it was derived from a Portuguese name meaning good bay.[6] This is based on the fact that bom is Portuguese for good, and the English word bay is similar to the Portuguese baía (bahia in old spelling). However, the normal Portuguese rendering of good bay would have been bahia boa rather than the grammatically incorrect bom bahia.

&gt; Other sources give a different origin for the Portuguese toponym Bombaim. José Pedro Machado's Dicionário Onomástico Etimológico da Língua Portuguesa (""Portuguese Dictionary of Onomastics and Etymology"") mentions what is probably the first Portuguese reference to the place, dated from 1516, as Benamajambu or Tena-Maiambu,[7] pointing out that ""maiambu"" seems to refer to Mumba-Devi, the Hindu goddess after which the place is named in Marathi (Mumbai). In that same century the spelling seems to have evolved to Mombayn (1525)[8] and then Mombaim (1563).[9] The final form Bombaim appears later in the sixteenth century, as recorded by Gaspar Correia in his Lendas da Índia (""Legends of India"").[10] J.P. Machado seems to reject the ""Bom Bahia"" hypothesis, asserting that Portuguese records mentioning the presence of a bay at the place led the English to assume that the noun (bahia, ""bay"") was an integral part of the Portuguese toponym, giving rise to the English version Bombay, adapted from Portuguese.[11]

[Source](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Mumbai)

&gt; Bombay: city in western India, from Portuguese, and popularly explained as Portuguese bom bahia ""good bay,"" but that seems folk etymology (for one, the adjective is masculine and the noun is feminine), and the more likely candidate is the local Mumbadevi ""Goddess Mumba,"" a Hindu deity worshipped there.

9141,"&gt; AT&amp;T doesn’t dispute that it slowed data speeds for some consumers with unlimited plans, but a spokesman said the FCC previously endorsed the practice as legitimate and pointed to a **disclosure on AT&amp;T’s website as evidence the company has been fully transparent with customers.**

.

&gt; The FCC has also warned Verizon about the practice, indicating that more carriers may face penalties if they advertise unlimited data plans but cap the amount of data consumers can use at full speed.

&gt; Verizon defended the policy as a reasonable effort to manage its network but **ultimately dropped it last fall under pressure from the FCC.**

[Source](http://www.wsj.com/articles/fcc-to-fine-at-t-100-million-for-capping-unlimited-data-plans-1434557988)

AT&amp;T had made disclosures *yet* they were fined. Verizon backed off and trashed similar plans. So FCC seemingly had a point. From the same source:

&gt; The action is part of a new aggressiveness by the agencies in their regulation of wireless carriers, as these services have become increasingly vital in consumers’ lives. And mobile broadband providers can expect this regulatory trend to continue: The FCC reclassified the services as common carriers in February, expanding the agency’s authority over the industry.

.

&gt; “Unlimited means unlimited,” said FCC Enforcement Bureau Chief Travis LeBlanc.

Why exactly is FCC pissed at providers? Here:

&gt; The commission isn't taking issue with AT&amp;T's throttling for the purpose of ""reasonable network management,"" it's taking issue with AT&amp;T throttling customers indiscriminately **because they've used a lot of data.**

[Source](http://www.theverge.com/2015/6/17/8796575/att-fined-100-million-fcc-misleading-unlimited-data-throttling)

Sounds a lot like 'Fair Usage Policy', no?


Edit: very relevant..

&gt; This is different from before because AT&amp;T used to claim the right to throttle “unlimited” LTE data once users exceeded certainly limits for the duration of billing cycles. Now it seems that once your connection moves off a congested site or once the site you’re on is no longer congested, you’ll be returned to your normal LTE data speeds.

9173,"&gt; Innate qualities and tendencies are key ancient concepts in Indian literature. Maitrayaniya Upanishad is one of the earliest texts making an explicit reference to Hindu trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva and linking them to their Guna - as creator/activity, preserver/purity, destroyer/recycler respectively.

.

&gt; In Samkhya philosophy, a guṇa is one of three ""tendencies, qualities"": sattva, rajas and tamas. This category of qualities have been widely adopted by various schools of Hinduism for categorizing behavior and natural phenomena. The three qualities are:

&gt; - Sattva is the quality of balance, harmony, goodness, purity, universalizing, holistic, constructive, creative, building, positive, peaceful, virtuous.[22]

&gt; - Rajas is the quality of passion, activity, neither good nor bad and sometimes either, self centeredness, egoistic, individualizing, driven, moving, dynamic.[4][23]
  
&gt; - Tamas is the quality of imbalance, disorder, chaos, anxiety, impure, destructive, delusion, negative, dull or inactive, apathy, inertia or lethargy, violent, vicious, ignorant.

&gt; In Indian philosophy, these qualities are not considered as present in either-or fashion. Rather, everyone and everything has all three, only in different proportions and in different contexts. The living being or substance is viewed as the net result of the joint effect of these three qualities.


&gt; According to Samkya school, no one and nothing is either purely Sattvik or purely Rajasik or purely Tamasik. One's nature and behavior is a complex interplay of all of these, with each guna in varying degrees. In some, the conduct is Rajasik with significant influence of Sattvik guna, in some it is Rajasik with significant influence of Tamasik guna, and so on.

&gt; The balance of Gunas of everything and everyone can change and does. However, change in one quality faces inertia from other two qualities in Indian worldview. Change needs internal or external influence or reinforcement, as knowledge and force to transform. The force to change comes from Rajas guna, while Sattva guna empower towards harmonious and constructive change, while Tamas guna checks or retards the process.

&gt; In Indian mythology, **Vishnu is envisioned with more Sattva, Brahma with more Rajas, and Shiva seen with all three Gunas.**

[Source: Guna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gu%E1%B9%87a)







&gt; The Maitrayaniya Upanishad (Sanskrit: मैत्रायणीय उपनिषद्, Maitrāyaṇīya Upaniṣad) is an ancient Sanskrit text that is embedded inside the Yajurveda.

.

&gt; The paragraph 5.2 of the Upanishad asserts the Guna theory of Samkhya school of Hinduism. The text states that in the beginning the universe was darkness (Tamas) alone. The Brahman impelled Tamas to differentiate, thus arose passion (action qua action, Rajas). The Brahman impelled Rajas to continue differentiating, and thus arose purity (right action, truth, Sattva). **These three Gunas reside in everything.** The aspect of Brahman that characterizes Tamas is Rudra. The aspect of Brahman that characterizes Rajas is Brahma. The aspect of Brahman that characterizes Sattva is Vishnu.

.

&gt; Max Muller summarizes it as, ""the perceptive organs are his reins, the active organs his horses, the body his chariot, the mind the charioteer, the whip being the temperament (emotions). Driven by that whip, his body goes round and round like a wheel driven by the potter. This body is made intelligent, and he (Atman) is the driver thereof."" He experiences the fruits of his Karma, his personality the **weaving of the three Guṇas (sattvam, rajas, tamas).**
