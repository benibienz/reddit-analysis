This and other similar cases which were brought to notice on 'Lokshahi Din' exposed the harassment meted out to citizens by civic officials.

&gt; On Monday, NMC had organized Lokshahi Din, which is held every month to offer citizens a platform to interact with officials and put forth their grievances. However, the public meeting, which was chaired by additional municipal commissioner Nayana Gunde, evoked poor response with hardly 20 citizens submitting their complaints to the civic body. Two complaints each came from Dharampeth, Laxmi Nagar, Ashi Nagar and Gandhibagh zones while five from Dhantoli zone. Apart from this, three complaints were received about water works department, two about health department, and one each against executive engineer (public works) and assistant commissioner (local body tax).

&gt; Though sources from NMC said that maximum complaints were related to encroachments, some concerned dereliction of duties by NMC officials, and corruption.

&gt; Ilias, owner of a paan kiosk, got his shop registered in his name around four years back. He was issued a market tax demand note of Rs4,000. A local politician approached him, offering to get the tax reduced. But Ilias was asked to pay a bribe of Rs1,000 to the NMC official concerned. When he refused, he was issued a revised demand note of Rs6, 240.

&gt; Since then, Ilias has been doing rounds of NMC to get his tax reduced to the original amount but in vain. ""For poor people like us, even Rs2,000 matter a lot. Rs6,000 is a huge amount for me. Why should I pay extra money just because I refused to pay a bribe?"" said Ilias.

&gt; Harish Kundle's grandfather left him their ancestral 'wada' at Bajeria. The total area of the premises is around 535.6 square metres. Kundle sold some part of it and lives in the remaining area. To preserve the age-old tradition of having an open space in the wada for get-togethers and recreational activities, he did not sell the open space in front of his house. However, his purpose was soon defeated as the buyers encroached on the some parts by building staircases and other constructions.

&gt; Kundle rued that following his complaints, NMC only took cosmetic action. ""In the last one-and-a half year, NMC has issued 8-10 notices and two reminders. Once, the anti-encroachment squad came to demolish the illegal structures but only razed a part of it,"" he said.

&gt; In some cases, no action was taken even when lives were at stake. In spite of repeated complaints, civic officials refused to crack down on encroachers who have allegedly obtained power connections from an electric pole at Kaushalya Nagar. ""The encroachers did not take permission from the slum department before building their houses near the pole. All of them are illegally drawing power from the pole. Although this is MSEDCL's job to disconnect them, NMC must remove the encroachers as there is no space left for power officials to carry repair work,"" said a resident Krishna Patil. He added that the wires posed a threat to human life.

And it doesn't seem sporty at all. A caterer hired for a private garba event being held at the government-managed stadium not only burned garbage multiple times on its open grounds, but also dumped a part of it in public area. What was worse is that neither the caterer, not the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) owned up the mistake. 

&gt; The garbage, consisting mostly of disposable plates and cups along with leftover food, was strewn across various points at the stadium. Rajput Singh, one of owners of the catering company said that despite the company trying to dispose of the garbage in the best way possible, they had no other option but to burn it.


&gt; His business partner Vivek Pandey, too, shrugged off the responsibility saying, ""My contract is only to cater food during the Navratri event. Garbage clean up is the responsibility of the event organizer."" Pandey said NMC officials did not cooperate with them in ensuring the garbage gets picked up properly. Singh said, ""We have been calling for NMC garbage truck but our demands fell on deaf ears. We had to make our own arrangements to take away the garbage."" He admitted that sometimes they had to dump the garbage ""in the grounds behind the sports complex"".


&gt; NMC officials clarified that it is not their responsibility to collect garbage from private events. Mahesh Dhamecha, assistant commissioner, Mangalwari zone said, ""It is illegal to burn garbage in open air. People doing it should come forward and own up or face penalties."" But Dhamecha also conveniently passed the buck saying that if the garbage was burned inside the stadium campus, it is not under his purview. TOI learnt that NMC officials reached the spot later in the day and gave the caterer the option to pay a fine or else pay the NMC for picking up the garbage. The catering company told the NMC that they would prefer taking the garbage by their own vehicles and disposing it of at the designated spot.

&gt; Intelligence agencies have started searching for those who planned protests just a few hours before Nawazuddin Siddiqui was slated to perform as Marich in a Ram Leela performance in his native village Budhana followed by his announcement to pull out. The inability to play such a small part as that of Marich in Ram Leela has given him publicity of the sort that he wouldn’t have ever gained by playing it in the first place. It is being said that a meeting between Budhana Chairman and Nawazuddin at his home is not just a coincidence but part this script. 

&gt; Budhana and Muzzaffarnagar are rife with discussions that Nawazuddin had indicated eagerness to play a part in Ram Leela just to distract attention from the allegations his sister-in-law had levelled against his family. Though he has tweeted that it was his desire since childhood to participate in Ram Leela, he had never before approached the Ram Leela Samiti for the same. At the same time, there are murmurs that it is someone else who are involved in the episode of opposition to his ascending the Ram Leela stage. The Shiv Sena had neither staged any demonstration, nor given any memo to district authorities opposing Nawazuddin’s participation in the show. The Shiv Sena district vice president had only on a phone call, registered his opposition to Nawazuddin, to the Ram Leela Committee members and district police administration. When the police got in touch with the Ram Leela Committee members to make inquiries, they informed Nawazuddin and then suddenly came the announcement of postponement of the performance just hours before the show was about to begin.
Jitendra Tyagi of the BJP is the current Chairman of Budhana Nagar Panchayat. Nawazuddin’s family is known to be close to Jitendra’s opponent Subodh Tyagi. It is being said lest the allegation of opposition to Nawazuddin’s performance be levelled against his party man, the very next day Union Minister of State for Water Resources [Sanjiv Balyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjeev_Balyan) who had gone to Sirsauli in connection with birthday celebrations of Chaudhary Mahendra Singh Tikait, visited Budhana Chairman Jitendra Tyagi and called Nawazuddin for a meeting. Good amount of publicity was given to this meeting. From there, [Sanjiv Balyan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdcwjciHUVk) expressed regret at Nawazuddin being unable to perform in Ram Leela and said people responsible for the incident are wrong. Now the Intelligence is trying to find out who exactly was behind the entire episode. It is said even the state administration has expressed interest in the matter.

&gt; **Police did nothing the next day**

&gt; Budhana: Nawazuddin’s performance slated for around 9 PM on 5 October was postponed but the entire following day police did nothing. After it became a big issue on social media with news channels carrying the story, police registered a case against a Shiv Sena leader 36 hours after the incident.


&gt; **Nawazuddin’s family silent on the issue**

&gt; On 7 October, Nawazuddin left Budhana for Delhi. Though he has been getting offers from several Ram Leela events in Muzaffarnagar, he and his family have maintained silence on the issue.

&gt; बुढाना में रामलीला के स्टेज पर अभिनय करने से मात्र चंद घंटे पूर्व विरोध कर नवाजुद्दीन सिद्दीकी को मारीच के अभिनय से रोक देने के मामले में पर्दे के पीछे के सूत्राधार की तलाश में खुफिया विभाग सक्रिय हो गया है। रामलीला के मंच पर मारीच जैसे छोटे अभिनय को नही कर पाने से नवाजुद्दीन को पूरे देश में इतना प्रचार मिल गया है जो वह अभिनय करके भी नही ले पाते। माना जा रहा है कि बुढाना चेयरमैन के घर पर नवाजुद्दीन और संजीव बालियान की मुलाकात महज इत्तेफाक नही बल्कि इसी स्क्रिप्ट का हिस्सा रही है । 
नवाजुद्दीन सिद्दीकी के बारे में बुढाना और मुजफ्फरनगर में चर्चा है कि वह अपने भाई की पत्नी द्वारा लगाए गए आरोप से ध्यान बंटाने के लिए ही अचानक रामलीला में अभिनय करने के लिए उत्सुक दिखाई दिए। हालांकि उन्होंने अपने ट्वीट में इसे अपने बचपन की इच्छा बताया है लेकिन आरोप लगने से पहले उन्होंने कभी भी रामलीला समिति से स्टेज पर अभिनय करने की इच्छा नही जताई थी। वहीं उन्हें रामलीला के स्टेज पर चढ़ने से रोकने के लिए विरोध कराने के पीछे असली सूत्राधार कोई ओर होने की चर्चा भी जोरों पर है। नवाजुद्दीन के स्टेज पर अभिनय करने के विरोध में शिवसेना ने न तो कोई प्रदर्शन किया और न ही कोई ज्ञापन दिया। बताया जाता है कि शिवसेना के जिला उपप्रमुख ने केवल फोन पर रामलीला कमेटी के पदाधिकारियो और पुलिस प्रशासन से ही इस पर आपत्ति जताई थी। पुलिस ने रामलीला कमेटी के पदाधिकारियों से सवाल जवाब किए तो उन्होंने नवाजुद्दीन सिद्दीकी को अवगत कराया। इसके बाद अचानक कार्यक्रम स्थगित किए जाने की घोषणा रामलीला शुरू होने से कुछ समय पूर्व ही की गई। 
बुढाना में इस समय नगर पंचायत के चेयरमैन भाजपा के जितेंद्र त्यागी हैं। जबकि नवाजुद्दीन का परिवार उनके विरोधी सुबोध त्यागी के निकट माना जाता है। चर्चा है कि नवाजुद्दीन के विरोध का ठींकरा कहीं चेयरमैन के सिर न फूट जाएं इसलिए अगले ही दिन सिसौली में चौधरी महेंद्र सिंह टिकैत के जन्मदिन समारोह में गए केंद्रीय जल संसाधन राज्यमंत्री संजीव बालियान बुढाना में चेयरमैन जितेंद्र त्यागी के घर पहुंच गए और वहां पर फोन करके नवाजुद्दीन सिद्दीकी को बुलवाया गया। दोनों की मुलाकात होने का खूब प्रचार किया गया। संजीव बालियान ने चेयरमैन के घर बैठकर नवाजुद्दीन के रामलीला में अभिनय न करने पर दुख जाहिर कर विरोध करने वालों को गलत बताया। अब खुफिया विभाग इस बात की टोह लेने में लगा है कि वास्तव में इसके पीछे असली सूत्राधार कौन हैं। बताया जाता है कि प्रदेश शासन भी इस मामले में दिलचस्पी दिखा रहा है।

&gt; अगले दिन पुलिस भी हाथ पर हाथ धरे बैठी रही

&gt; बुढाना। पांच अक्टूबर की रात में करीब नौ बजे नवाजुद्दीन का मारीच बनने का कार्यक्रम स्थगित हुआ लेकिन छह अक्टूबर को पूरे दिन पुलिस ने इस संबंध में कोई कार्रवाई नही की। सात अक्टूबर को समाचारों में सुर्खियो बनने के बाद मामले ने सोशल मीडिया पर जोर पकड गया तो करीब 36 घंटे बाद एसएसपी के आदेश पर बुढाना के प्रभारी निरीक्षक ने अपनी ओर से शिवसेना के नेता के खिलाफ मामला दर्ज किया। 

&gt; नवाजुद्दीन के परिवार ने चुप्पी साधी

&gt; नवाजुद्दीन सिद्दीकी सात अक्टूबर को बुढाना से दिल्ली के लिए रवाना हो गए। उनको मुजफ्फरनगर की अन्य रामलीलाओं से स्टेज पर अभिनय करने के लिए ऑफर दिए गए हैं पर खुद नवाजुद्दीन ने और बुढाना में उनके परिवार ने इस प्रकरण में चुप्पी साध ली है। वह कुछ भी अब इस मामले में नही बोल रहे हैं।

&gt; जानसठ कांधला से नवाजूददीन को रामलीला में अभिनय का न्यौता

&gt; जानसठ/ कांधला। हमारे संवाददाता 

&gt; जानसठ नगर की प्राचीन रामलीला हिन्दु मुस्लिम एकता कमेटी ने बॉलीवुड अभिनेता नवाजूददीन सिददकी को रामलीला के मंच पर रोल अदा करने का निमंत्रण दिया है। वहीं कांधला में नगर श्री रामलीला कमैटी मड़प पंचवटी के पदाधिकारीयों ने भी अभिनेता को अपने यहां अभिनय करने के लिए निमंत्रण दिया है।
जानसठ कस्बे की मोहल्ला मिश्रान स्थित प्राचीन रामलीला कमेटी ने मीटिंग कर अभिनेता नवाजूददीन सिददकी को अपनी रामलीला के मंच पर किसी भी कलाकार का रोल अदा करने के लिए फोन पर बात कर आमंत्रित किया। रामलीला कमेटी के अध्यक्ष वेदप्रकाश सैनी ने बताया कि हमारे रामलीला स्टेज पर सिददकी द्वारा रोल अदा करने से हिन्दु मुस्लिम एकता की मिसाल कायम होगी और कस्बे का भी नाम रोशन होगा। वहीं कांधला में स्थानीय रामलीला कमैटी मंडप पचंवटी के व प्रबंधक रामकुमार सिंघल व उपाध्यक्ष मेहरचंद सिंघल ने फिल्म अभिनेता से उनके निवास पर भेट़ कर रामलीला मंचन स्थल पर अभिनय करने के लिये आमंत्रित किया। प्रबंधक रामकुमार सिंघल ने बताया कि कस्बे की रामलीला मंचन दोनो समुदायों के लोगों को परस्पर जोड़ने का काम कर रही है।

&gt; TL;DR: Jansaath Ram Leela Hindu Muslim Ekta Committee has invited Nawazuddin to perform on their stage as have those from Kandhla.

Here's the local Shiv Sena unit head telling media they resented Nawazuddin's foray into the public staging of Ram Leela because of his [unsavoury character and bad reputation gained in the village community.](https://youtu.be/l3m-9VTpBDY?t=131) 

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

What's so wrong about Nawazuddin? Consider these:

Nawazuddin recalls when he was studying at NSD, Delhi all his batchmates had girlfriends except him. So he became friends with a girl. Once he took her to a park and **suddenly he grabbed her hand**:

&gt; नवाजुद्दीन यूपी के मुजफ्फरनगर जिले के बुढाना गांव से ताल्लुक रखते हैं।

&gt; नवाजुद्दीन ने पुराने इश्क का किस्सा सुनाते हुए बताया, ""तब मैं दिल्ली के एनएसडी में पढ़ाई कर रहा था। वहां सभी बैचमेट्स की गर्लफ्रेंड थीं सिवाए मेरे। मैंने भी एक लड़की से दोस्ती कर ली।""

&gt;""एक बार मैं उसके साथ पार्क घूमने गया था। वहां मैंने उसका हाथ पकड़ लिया। इस बात पर उसने मुझे डांट दिया। इस पर मेरी आंखों में आंसू आ गए।""

&gt; ""मुझे इमोशनल देख उसने कहा किसी को टच करने से पहले परमिशन लेना चाहिए। यह कहकर उसने मुझे गले से लगा लिया,"" नवाजुद्दीन ने हंसते हुए बताया।

&gt;  नवाजुद्दीन ने बताया कि उनके इसी रियल लाइफ वाकये को गैंग्स ऑफ वासेपुर-2 में फिलमाया गया।


That's not all. Before this, when he was a teenager in his village, he would follow a girl who would often go to the only house in the village that had a tv set, and once **ambushed her and grabbed her hand** and said 'what's there to watch in a tv, see me instead'!

&gt; **जबरन पकड़ा था पड़ोसन का हाथ**

&gt; टीनेज में उन्हें पड़ोस में रहनेवाली एक लड़की से इश्क हो गया था।

&gt; अपने फर्स्ट लव के बारे में नवाजुद्दीन ने बताया, ""मैं तब 17 साल का था। हमारे गांव में केवल एक घर में टीवी हुआ करता था। मेरे पड़ोस की लड़की टीवी देखने उस घर में जाया करती थी। मैं उस पर फिदा था, इसलिए उसका पीछा करने लगा। उसकी ही वजह से मैं भी टीवी देख लेता था।""

&gt; ""मैं उसका पीछा करता था। एक दिन हिम्मत करके मैंने उसका हाथ पकड़ लिया। मैंने कहा - टीवी में क्या रखा है, मुझे देखो। उसने गुस्से में हाथ झटकते हुए कहा - टीवी ज्यादा जरूरी है।""

&gt; ""मैंने उसे जवाब दिया कि एक दिन मैं भी टीवी पर आऊंगा, तब मुझे देखना। बस हमारी इतनी ही बात हुई और मेरे मन में कुछ करने का फितूर सवार हो गया।""

Nawazuddin has had to face allegations of **kicking his pregnant sister-in-law and harrassing her for dowry**:


&gt; फिल्म अभिनेता और बॉलीवुड के नए खलनायक नवाजुद्दीन सिद्दकी पर उनके छोटे भाई की पत्नी के आरोप लगाने का मामला सामने आया है। सिद्दकी पर दहेज के लिए मारपीट और कई गंभीर आरोप लगाए गए है।

&gt; दिल्ली के जाफराबाद निवासी युवती का निकाह अभिनेता नवाजुद्दीन सिद्दीकी के छोटे भाई मिनाजुद्दीन सिद्दीकी से 31 मई 2016 को हुआ था। आरोप है कि निकाह के बाद से ही पति व ससुराल वाले दहेज की मांग करते हुए उसे प्रताडि़त कर रहे हैं।

&gt; पीडि़ता ने पति पर नशे की गोलियां व इंजेक्शन लगाने का भी आरोप लगाया है। कोतवाली पुलिस द्वारा सुनवाई न करने पर वह शुक्रवार को माता-पिता व चाचा के साथ एसएसपी कार्यालय पहुंची थी। दूसरी ओर नवाजुद्दीन सिद्दीकी बुढ़ाना स्थित अपने घर पर मौजूद हैं।

&gt; परिजनों ने तेज बुखार से पीडि़त होने के कारण बातचीत कराने से इन्कार कर दिया है। इस मामले में परिवार का कोई भी सदस्य बोलने को तैयार नहीं है। दूसरी ओर, नवाजुद्दीन के पड़ोसियों ने दबे स्वर में मिनाजुद्दीन व उसकी पत्नी के बीच विवाद की बात कही।

&gt; बता दें कि आरोप है कि 28 सितंबर को नवाजुद्दीन सिद्दकी समेत महिला के पति व अन्य ससुराल वालों ने उससे मारपीट की। मायके से चाचा-चाची बुढ़ाना आए तो उन्हें भी पीटा। आरोप है कि नवाजुद्दीन सिद्दीकी ने तीन माह का गर्भ गिराने के उद्देश्य से उसके पेट में लात मारी।

374,2016-09-26 17:21:20+00:00,self.nagpur,https://www.reddit.com/r/nagpur/comments/54lq6r/after_rejecting_it_twice_civic_body_allots_cement/,False,"&gt; Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) standing committee had twice rejected proposals to give work order of two packages worth Rs29.15 crore in the cement concrete road project-II to Kamptee-based Abhi Engineering. Then, suddenly, the committee dumped its decisions and recently approved the work orders. Sources said this came about because the company is close to a minister.

&gt; The standing committee had first taken the decision not to give work orders to the private company on February 29 and then again on June 27. But the committee approved the work orders on September 12.

&gt; The projects department issued a letter of intent to the private company a couple of days ago. Now, NMC will enter into an agreement with the private company to execute the two packages, which are part of the Rs324 crore cement concrete road project-II.

&gt; NMC sources told TOI that the administration did not implement the standing committee's first two decisions to reject the work orders and go for re-tendering since the company is said to be close to a minister. ""The standing committee had even directed short tendering to ensure speedy completion of process and execution of works. But, the administration kept on pursuing the case over seven months,"" sources said.

&gt; They added there was a cold war between mayor Pravin Datke and the minister over this company. ""Datkeknew the company was not qualified for the cement concrete road works. He asked the standing committee not to approve the work orders. He remained firm on the decision even after he received a call from the minister to consider the company,"" the sources said.

&gt; However, the projects department had made a technical mistake in the case. It had opened the financial bid of the private company, when it should have disqualified the company in the technical bid itself. The concerned minister approached another senior minister and argued this point. ""Then Datke had to relent and gave the green signal to the standing committee,"" sources said.

&gt; To save face, the standing committee appointed a subcommittee to verify the private company's works and submit a report. The committee comprised all NMC officials, who submitted a report in favour of the private company.

&gt; Another bidder for the works had also lodged a complaint against Abhi Engineering, but that too was set aside.

&gt; Datke told TOI he had received some complaints, so he asked the standing committee to verify details of the company. ""Now, the administration has cleared the points raised by the standing committee. We have to ensure speedy execution and completion of the project,"" he said.

&gt; Standing committee chairman Sudhir Raut said the decision to approve work orders was taken as per the committee's recommendation. However, he did not explain why the standing committee went back on its two earlier resolutions.

&gt; Ajju Vijayvargiya of Abhi Engineering first spoke to TOI in detail about the case, but later refused to be quoted in this story.

&gt; The private company will now execute the package-I of Rs11.69 crore covering South Ambazari Road fromRahate Colony T-point to Mate Squareand package-II worth Rs17.46 crore from Mate Square to Ambazari Lake T-point, Mangalmurti Square toShitlamata Mandir and RPTS Road from Madhav Nagar Square to WHC Road.

&gt; **Executive engineers to speed up project**



&gt; The delay in execution of Rs324 crore cement concrete road project-II has forced NMC to appoint four executive engineers just to oversee the project. For this, the civic body has abandoned its first-of-its-kind plan to appoint an executive engineer for each of the 10 zones. 



&gt; Earlier, one executive engineer used to look after civil works of two-three zones. Other executive engineers used to head departments like estate, traffic, projects, water, hot mix etc. To ensure proper and timely works, NMC had appointed one executive engineer for each zone a few months ago, for the first time in history.



&gt; A couple of days ago, NMC appointed four executive engineers — Mahesh Gupta, MG Kukreja, Narendra Borkar and MH Talewar — specially for the cement roads project and relieved them from the zones. They also have charges of their departments.



&gt; Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had announced the cement roads project in December 2014. NMC is yet to issue work orders for all packages in the project. Also, CM has already approved project III worth Rs300 crore for NMC.

With 10 days left for September to end, NMC employees have not yet received salaries for August. Many are relying on their savings, but not all have that option.

&gt; Contractors executing various works for the civic body too have been kept waiting for payments for weeks. NMC has also defaulted on payments to the Kanak Resources Management Ltd, entrusted with lifting garbage from city since April this year. The outstanding dues are around Rs22 crore.

&gt; After abolition of LBT, many urban local bodies have been unable to pay salaries to staffers on time because of huge fall in revenue. Sources said salaries were disbursed on time until December 2014. With the decision to scrap LBT from August 1 last year, the fall in revenue after LBT exceeded what was planned for and the NMC is feeling the pinch more over the last few months.

&gt; Till August this financial year, revenue from various sources was Rs498.65 crore as against a committed expenditure of over Rs70 crore every month (Rs 350 crore so far). In addition money is to be given for development and maintenance work.

&gt; Ramesh Dahake (name changed) is a sanitary worker with the NMC and father of two school going children. He has to borrow money every 60 days. ""It is embarrassing. After every few months, I have to borrow some money from relatives to meet basic needs. Both my children are studying in municipal schools and I don't have to pay their fees but even they have needs. The situation is the same every other month. We receive our salary late and no one comes up with a permanent solution. For Class IV employees, particularly, it is difficult to survive as we have a meagre salary and no savings,"" a miffed Dahake said.

&gt; A delegation of sanitary workers met additional municipal commissioner with a request to prioritize timely disbursal of salaries every month. ""We requested the mayor to ensure there was no delay. The employees are now tired and don't want to go on a strike. It is of no use as neither the corporation, nor the government pays any heed to our demands,"" the delegation said.

&gt; ""There are employees who have housing loan and due to erratic salaries, they are facing threat of defaulting on loans,"" said a senior official. ""If we knew about this financial crunch, we wouldn't have gone for loan. Now, it is a burden for us and we have to pay additional interest if there is a delay in paying EMIs. The situation is grim and the government should intervene to assist the corporation,"" said a schoolteacher.


&gt; Senior officer from NMC's accounts and finance department admitted that the civic body had not paid salaries of its 10,000 staffers this month. ""Rs40 crore is required to disburse salaries to all including daily wage employees and pensions,"" he explained, claiming arrangements were being made to pay the salaries.


&gt; Mayor Pravin Datke and municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar were not available for comments. Standing committee chairman Sudhir Raut said salaries would be disbursed within a couple of days. He claimed NMC had also approached the state government to increase the monthly grant of Rs40 crore to Rs60 crore.


&gt; Committed expenditure of every month: Salaries — Rs32 crore; Pension---Rs8.50 crore, Bills towards electric consumption — Rs10 crore, Loan instalment---Rs5 crore, Kanak Resources ---Rs5.50 crore and Miscellaneous expenditures Rs10 crore


&gt; Income in August: LBT--Rs5.60 lakh; Property tax:-Rs8.30 lakh: income from water works: Rs1227.62 lakh; market--Rs53.53 lakh, town planning---Rs329.63 lakh; other--Rs280.88 lakh, education grant--Rs334.34 lakh; LBT grant--- Rs 4064 lakh

438,2016-09-21 14:21:40+00:00,self.nagpur,https://www.reddit.com/r/nagpur/comments/53td7u/nmc_likely_to_hike_amount_it_pays_to_private/,False,"&gt; Cash-strapped Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is all set to increase the rate being paid to private water operators at Orange City Water Private Limited (OCW) for the fifth consecutive year. OCW payment will increase to around Rs 98 crore per annum from Rs 72 crore.

&gt; NMC sources told TOI that the proposal to increase rate to Rs10.72/unit from existing Rs 10.43 per unit has been received by the OCW. ""NMC's special purpose vehicle, Nagpur Environmental Services Limited (NESL), will be approving the hike for OCW after checking the wholesale price index (WPI) and consumer price index (CPI). Municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar will approve the new rate without requiring any consent from the standing committee or the general body,"" the sources said.

&gt; If approved, it will be a hike of 36% in last five years. The NMC had entered into an agreement with OCW for a rate of Rs 7.90/unit in 2011-12.

&gt; The revision in OCW rate will increase NMC's huge financial losses from water works and also the burden on hapless water consumers. NMC used to incur a loss of around Rs14 crore per annum before handing over water works to OCW. The losses increased to Rs75 crore after roping in OCW.

&gt; It happened due to the controversial agreement signed with OCW. NMC agreed to pay OCW for 250 million liters per day (MLD) as against water billing of around 185 MLD. The rate was fixed at Rs7.90 per unit despite water tariff at Rs5 per unit. Also, provisions of increase in OCW rate were made in the agreement. The OCW rate was linked with WPI and CPI. Hike is given as per the revisions made in these two indexes every year.

&gt; To cope up with regular hike in OCW rate, the NMC is increasing the water tariff in every fiscal since 2011-12. The hapless water consumers are facing 5% hike in water tariff every year. Still, the hike in OCW rate is much more than that of water tariff. OCW's new rate will be Rs10.72 per unit while minimum water tariff is Rs6.68 per unit.

&gt; Chairman of water works consultative committee Sandip Joshi said he was not aware of any such proposal.

&gt; Leader of opposition Vikas Thakre said, NMC should terminate agreement with OCW as citizens are going to face high water tariff every year. ""OCW failed on all accounts, be it water supply, water losses, metering, revenue and execution of 24x7 water supply project. Even services deteriorated since NMC roped in OCW. NMC is gifting crores to OCW as rate is not linked with performance,"" he said.

&gt; OCW said services have improved to a great extent in various parts of the city since it took over the water works. ""Around 3 lakh people benefit from 24x7 water supply.""

The BJP reportedly promised to discuss the issue in the general body meeting on Friday, but then kept mum. Interestingly, the Congress-led opposition raised the issue and did not allow the house to function. The proposals on agenda were passed without discussions, with no decision taken on the insult of the corporators.

After the demonstrations inside the house, mayor Pravin Datke also faced strong protests by Shiv Sena woman corporator Alka Dalal and 11 corporators of ruling alliance outside the Town Hall at Mahal.

When the general body meeting started, leader of opposition group Vikas Thakre raised the issue of the insult of ruling alliance corporators by OCW. ""Corporators were booked by police following an FIR by OCW. The BJP did not take any cognisance. Now, OCW has even insulted the ruling alliance corporators. BJP is under pressure from its top leaders to not act against OCW. But we will not tolerate such insult. In fact, OCW should be ousted as water supply services are worsening,"" he said.

Thakre also accused the BJP of protecting tar road works contractors as inquiry report on road works scam was not tabled in the house. 

One of the ruling alliance corporators, Ravindra Dolas, also raised the insult by OCW officials. But Datke wanted the house to discuss only the proposals on the agenda. Congress corporators rushed into the well of the house and staged demonstrations. After adjourning the meeting for 10 minutes, Datke read out the proposals on the agenda and declared them approved before winding up proceedings. 

Later, the 11 corporators staged demonstrations outside Town Hall, condemning the inaction against OCW. Datke assured to take up the issue in the next general body meeting.


Dalal shouted at the mayor and also condemned the lack of discussions on the proposals submitted by her. ""One related to NMC giving benefits to a private educational institution and another related to Maskasath RoB. It took me two years to bring the issues to the general body. Now, I will have to again follow the same process. It is an injustice towards a woman corporator,"" she said.


Ruling alliance corporator and former mayor Kishor Dorle said the BJP dumped them after taking advantage of their support. ""BJP gained power at NMC in 2012 with the help of independent corporators and those from small parties. BJP leaders broke our team and inducted a few of us into the party. We raised issues related to OCW with mayor and also ruling party leader Dayashankar Tiwari, but got no response. We decided to go to OCW office and solve the problems. OCW locked the office and took us for a meeting to the terrace. None of the OCW officials came to discuss the issue. We objected to OCW's behaviour and left. Then we met municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar and lodged a complaint against OCW,"" he said. 


No decision was taken on the proposal seeking increase in corporators' remuneration. General body has passed a resolution in this regard some 18 months ago and it is pending with the government.


Datke said Hardikar will submit action taken report on alleged road works scam in the next meeting.

The function was addressed by RSS national executive member Indresh Kumar, who also heads the Muslim Rashtriya Manch (MRM) formed in 2002.
Earlier, it was claimed that for the first time, an RSS functionary would enter a madrassa and unfurl the flag on Independence Day.
Instead of a madrassa, the function was held at Dawoodi Bohra colony, an isolated residential pocket in North Nagpur. The main Muslim localities like Mominpura or Jaffar Nagar were not the venue. Belonging to the Shia sect, Bohras — a trading community — are traditionally known to be close to RSS and BJP here. The community also accepts its Hindu roots which was also mentioned by one of their leaders during the function.
The audience included over 150 residents from the colony, who were later addressed by Kumar inside a mosque on the same premises.
Sources say madrassas were reluctant because of Kumar's credentials. He was among the accused in the Amjer dargah blast case of 2007, though acquitted later. ""It was mainly because Kumar was supposed to address the function, a message was spread by BJP and MRM leaders seeking participation by the madrassas in Mominpura. The appeal was, however, 'rejected',"" said a community leader in the locality. This was the reason why the moderate Bohra community was chosen, say sources. Mominpura is a Sunni dominated pocket.
The MRM activists later explained that the colony was preferred instead because the madrassas did not have enough space. The kids from madarssas were brought to the Bohra colony. Similar functions were held elsewhere in the country too, they said.



As the crowd at Bohra colony raised slogans like Vande Matram and Bharat Mata ki jai, Kumar announced setting up of an anti-terror cell of RSS, which will work on weaning away Muslim youth from outfits like IS. The activists will go to educational institutes and urge the Muslim youngsters to focus on education, he said.
Kumar said, ""India as a country existed from time immemorial and Islam came later. If Pakistan is championing Kashmir's separation, its own provinces like Sindh, Balochistan and North-West Frontier Province want to break away. The rebels are, however, brutally crushed using tanks and fighter planes.""




Shabbir Fidwi, a community leader of Bohras, also repeated Kumar's lines saying that it was only due religious tolerance in India that Islam could survive in the country.
Kumar said it was in 1986 when for the first time he addressed Muslims in a public rally. The rally was organized in sensitive Rajauri town of J&amp;K having Muslim majority. The event was held at the behest of a Congress leader. ""The situation was grim with chances of violence breaking out but since then I have been winning the hearts of Muslims,"" he said.
He commented, ""Pakistan was born in 1947 and the nature's law is that anyone born has to die. So would Pakistan, all we can hope is to remain alive to pay last respects to it.""

The Fadnavis Government signed an agreement that is extremely favorable to Gujarat on 7th January, 2015. Surprisingly, the agreement was signed despite objections raised by the Nashik Irrigation Department and Tapi Irrigation Board. An RTI has revealed that the Maharashtra Government conveniently overlooked these objections.

&gt; At a time when states are trying their best to secure rights over water, it is unfathomable why Maharashtra simply gave up theirs. A RTI query by Jeetendra Ghadge has made this shocking revelation. As per Maharashtra-Gujarat water sharing arrangement, Gujarat was mandated to supply 5 tmc water from the Ukai project for farmers displaced by the Sardar Sarovar Project. In addition, as ruled by the Narmada Tribunal Maharashtra was to get 10 tmc water from the Narmada itself. As per the agreement signed on 7th January, 2015 by Fadnavis Government, Maharashtra will get 5 tmc water from Ukai. But Maharashtra will get only 5 tmc out of it's share of 10 tmc Narmada water.

आणण्यासाठीच सरकार जाचक अटी लादत असल्याचेही ते म्हणाले.

Translation:

&gt; Office bearers and workers of jewelers' organizations that are on strike for various demands, visited Raj Thackeray at his residence Krishna Kunj this Friday. They also indulged in chanting the slogan '*ek hi bhool, kamal ka phool*' ['that one mistake, the lotus flower' - apparent reference to an admission that they consider voting for BJP as a mistake]. The very same BJP on whose side we stood by physically, mentally and financially is now only giving us utter disappointment, is what they told Raj Thackeray.

&gt; Despite strongly supporting BJP during the elections how could this have happened, Raj reportedly counter questioned the office bearers. To which they replied, it was a mistake on our part; those who gave us numerous assurances then, do not agree to meet us to even listen to our grievances today. They bragged that they will work on all our demands once their government is formed, and now they are nowhere to be seen. So we will not commit that mistake again, is what the office bearers also conveyed to Raj.

&gt; They discussed the problems and demands of the organization which Raj said seemed quite valid and reasonable. He advised them to persist with the strike. This government will not listen to you till they get singed, is what Raj conveyed to them. Big jewelery companies from across the world are trying to claim the [Indian] market, which is why government is trying to pressurize small and medium businesses by enforcing strict terms, he said.

&gt; राहुल बजाज यांच्या बजाज कंपनीच्या ७० हजार नव्या रिक्षांचा लॉट तयार असून, केवळ राहुल बजाज यांना फायदा व्हावा यासाठी फडणवीस सरकारने हा नव्या परवान्यांचा घाट घातल्याचा आरोप राज यांनी यावेळी केला. एका रिक्षाची किंमत १ लाख ७० हजार इतकी गृहित धरली असता ७० हजार रिक्षांसाठी सरकारचा एकूण ११९० कोटींचा राहुल बजाज यांच्या कंपनीसोबत करार झाला असल्याचे राज म्हणाले. भ्रष्टाचार समूळ नष्ट करण्याची घोषणाबाजी करणारे देवेंद्र फडणवीस यांनी याबाबत उत्तर द्यावे नाहीतर नव्या रिक्षा रस्त्यावर उतरणार असतील तर रिक्षातील प्रवाशांना आणि चालकाला खाली उतरवून ती रिक्षा जाळून टाकण्यात येतील, अशी भूमिका राज यांनी मांडली.

Translation: 


The State Transport Department plans to distribute 70,000 autorickshaw permits in the coming days. But of these, 70% permits have been given to outsiders. Basically, when there is no space in Mumbai to accommodate these 70,000 autorickshaws, what is then the reason for distributing these permits? Raising this issue, MNS Chief Raj Thackeray instructed his workers to burn new autorickshaws if seen plying on the roads. He was speaking at a function organized at Shanmukhanand Hall in Mumbai to mark the completion of 10 years of the MNS.

Raj alleged that Rahul Bajaj's company has created a lot of 70,000 rickshaws and only to benefit Rahul Bajaj has the Fadnavis government decided to take this step. Assuming one rickshaw sells for 1,70,000 the government has gotten into a deal amounting to 1190 crores, he said. As Devendra Fadnavis has always raised slogans claiming to strive for rooting out corruption, either he should come clean on this issue or such newly plying rickshaws will be burnt after removing the driver and passengers sitting in them.

.


**Issues raised by Raj in his speech-**

MNS has exposed 40,000 fake autorickshaw permits.

&gt; कंपनी में काम करनेवाले उसके दोस्त के साथ वह कल मुंडवा में पार्टी के लिए जा रही थी।

&gt; दोस्त ने उसे धोखे से नशे की दवा मिलाई हुई शराब पिलाई।

&gt; पार्टी की जगह जाने की बजाय वह उसे अपने धानोरी स्थित फ्लैट पर ले गया।

&gt; वहां पर पहले से ही उसके चार साथी और एक युवती मौजूद थे।

&gt; सभी ने शराब पी रखी थी।

&gt; पीडित युवती बेहोश होने से उसके कुछ पता नहीं चला

&gt; पांचों ने उसके साथ गैंगरेप किया।

&gt; महीने के भीतर तीसरी वारदात

&gt; शहर में एक महीने के भीतर रेप की यह तीसरी वारदात हुई है।

&gt; वैलेंटाइन डे के दिन शहर के हड़पसर इलाके में पार्टी मनाने के बाद युवती का उसके ही दोस्तों ने रेप किया था।

&gt; वहीं गुरुवार को हनुमान टेकड़ी इलाके में अकेली काॅलेज छात्रा संग रेप हुआ था।

&gt; पुणे में एक आईटी प्रफेशनल से गैंगरेप का मामला सामने आया है। पीड़िता ने अपने पांच दोस्तों पर आरोप लगाया है कि उन्होंने उससे रेप किया और फिर उसे बेहोश छोड़कर भाग गए। पीड़िता को सैसून अस्पताल में भर्ती कराया गया है। पुलिस ने सभी आरोपियों को गिरफ्तार कर लिया है।

&gt; मिली जानकारी के मुताबिक हिंजवडी आईटी पार्क में काम करने वाली 24 साल की लड़की शनिवार को अपने दोस्त के साथ होटल में खाना खाने गई थी। वे दोनों एक ही कंपनी में काम करते हैं। लड़की के दोस्त ने ही उसे पार्टी के लिए बुलाया था। इस दौरान उसने कथित रूप से उसके ड्रिंक में कोई नशीली दवा मिला दी जिससे वह बेहोश हो गई। लड़की के मुताबिक, जब उसे होश आया, तो उसने खुद को पुणे एयरपोर्ट के पास विश्रांतवाड़ी इलाके के एक फ्लैट में पाया।

&gt; पीड़िता ने बताया कि नशीली दवा खिलाने के बाद आधी बेहोशी की हालत में उसके दोस्त ने अपने चार साथियों के साथ उससे रेप किया। पीड़ित लड़की की शिकायत पर पुलिस ने अभिनय साही, दीपतांशु गुप्ता, देवरत दुबे, अनंत चानर और अभिजीत देवड़े को अरेस्ट कर लिया। इसके अलावा पुलिस ने एक महिला से पूछताछ की है।

&gt; पुलिस अधीक्षक राकेश चवाण ने बताया, 'पीड़िता एक फर्म में पिछले चार साल से काम कर रही है। गिरफ्तार लोगों में से एक अभिनय ने वहां एक महीने पहले ही जॉइन किया था। शनिवार को कंपनी के इवेंट में दोनों ने साथ जाने का फैसला किया था। पीड़िता ने अभिनय को अपनी कार में बिठाया। इवेंट में पहुंचने से पहले उन्होंने ड्रिंक करने का फैसला किया।'

&gt; घटना के बाद घर पहुंचने पर पीड़िता के पिता ने उसके देरी से आने की वजह पूछी तो उसने पूरा हाल बयान किया। इसके बाद वह उसे पुलिस स्टेशन ले गए और शिकायत दर्ज कराई।

While Chennai has made commendable progress, Mumbai and the rest of Maharashtra languished for want of a sustained awareness campaign, and planning and infrastructure. 

With a view to facilitate cadaver organ harvesting and transplantation, the Minister for Public Health and Family Welfare, Dr Deepak Sawant and Minister for Road Transport Mr Diwakar Raote, both of the Shiv Sena decided to coordinate functioning of both departments to create 'green corridors' - lanes without red traffic lights dedicated to ferrying donated organs to the site of surgery.

On 3rd August, 2015 the first heart transplant in Mumbai in recent times (the first ever took place in 1968) was conducted on a 22 year old cardiomyopathy patient called Anwar Khan who received the heart of a 42 year old woman who had died in Pune of brain stroke - the donated heart was transported from Pune to Mumbai's Fortis Hospital in 90 minutes flat via green corridors in each city:

&gt; The heart left Pune's Jehangir Hospital at 2.38pm and at 4pm, doctors at Mulund's Fortis Hospital had started the transplant operation. It was brought to Pune's airport in seven minutes, flown by air ambulance to Mumbai in half an hour, and reached Mulund from the Santacruz airport in 18 minutes in a Fortis ambulance that was escorted by a Mumbai police jeep and motorcycle. The ambulance had taken 90 minutes to reach the airport from the hospital.

It took some good planning and deft handling of traffic in Pune:

&gt; Alerted about the need to quickly transport the heart — transplants must happen within four hours, the sooner the better, the city traffic police pressed into service close to 150 personnel in the well-coordinated operation to create the first green corridor in the city for a heart transplant.

&gt; An assistant commissioner of police was at the wheel of the pilot jeep and two traffic policemen rode ahead on a motorcycle. One lane all along the route was kept free and all signals were green, exactly the way it's done for movement of VVIP visitors in city.

And in Mumbai too:

&gt; After traffic police chief Milind Bharambe learnt about the heart being ferried, his department chalked out a detailed plan to pilot the ambulance. ""We spoke to the airport authorities in advance so that no time would be wasted once the heart was airlifted to Mumbai airport,"" said a traffic police official. Bharambe said they had expected the journey to take 25 minutes, but it was done in 18.


&gt; ""We arranged for the ambulance to enter and exit the airport premises from gate no. 8 at Kalina instead of waiting outside,"" said ACP Vijay Dhatrak, who drove the pilot jeep. ""We kept in touch with the police control room, which alerted the outposts before we were to pass through their jurisdictions. These officers were out on the road to keep one lane free for our team.""

Encouraged by the results, Dr Deepak Sawant declared hospitals will get a green corridor whenever they ask for it, and that a permanent one will be tried to be set up for all critical patients - ""If there can be green corridors for VVIP movement, there can most certainly be one for critical patients in need of immediate medical aid"".

Within a week, a second similar feat was achieved for another heart transplant:

&gt; A green corridor was created from Vashi’s MGM hospital to Mulund’s Fortis. It took 14 minutes and 9 seconds for the live heart to be delivered in the 19 km journey. It generally takes more than an hour to reach Mulund from Vashi in peak hours.

Recently, a green corridor from Aurangabad to Pune facilitated liver transplantation not once but twice this week:

&gt; Five days after a green corridor was set up from Aurangabad to Pune for a liver transplant at Ruby Hall Clinic, a similar exercise was conducted Friday afternoon.

&gt; Traffic authorities set up the green corridor from government hospital Aurangabad to Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital and a liver was transported in three and-a-half hours for the transplant operation.

&gt; “We faced a challenging situation today as there were at least 25 traffic signals from Wagholi to Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital,” Sarang Awhad, DCP Traffic told The Indian Express. On Sunday, the green corridor had helped bring the liver in three hours owing to less traffic.

&gt; “However today we had to ensure traffic coordination so that the ambulance reached the hospital within minutes. It took 19 minutes to cover a distance of 17.03 km,” Awhad said.

&gt; “There was perfect coordination among traffic authorities at Aurangabad and Ahmednagar and once the team of doctors reached the outskirts of Pune at Wagholi, the Pune traffic department took over,” he said.

Now, Maharashtra Health ministry plans to formulate protocols to smoothen cadaver organ transplant efforts. 

&gt; This includes fixed air-ambulance rates, GPS for road ambulances and traffic police coordination, a different siren colour and sound for ambulances, and appointment of nodal officers in each division in the police force to clear the way for documental proceedings.

&gt; With a slew of bureaucratic clearances, the process of inter-city and inter-state cadaver organ transplant, which is currently riddled with time-consuming formalities, is set to get faster and simpler.

&gt; In a high-level meeting with health minister Deepak Sawant on Wednesday, issues like delays from the police end were raised. “For cadaver transplant, a no-objection certificate is required from the local police. Every time, we have to explain to them what a cadaver donation is and make several phone calls to get the clearance,” said doctor Gauri Rathod who heads the state organ donation at Directorate of Health Services. The procedure is more cumbersome for inter-city transplants.

&gt; Now, a nodal police officer assigned for each division will be trained on what cadaver donation is and what documents are required for the procedure. “The nodal officer will be contacted to facilitate every transplant,” Rathod added.


&gt; With a thrust in inter-state organ transplant, the health ministry is also deciding on how an ideal green corridor can be created by finalising air-ambulance fares and fixed road transport protocol. Before extracting an organ, the traffic police will be informed an hour in advance. A GPS in the ambulance will help in navigation and a sticker will be put up on the ambulance to show it is carrying an organ. The health ministry is also considering changing the sound of siren in the ambulance to show urgency in getting a road cleared.

&gt; In order to create awareness among the public about these movements, the traffic police will be using the variable message signs (VMS) signboards and also public announcement systems to divert or alert motorists to keep paths clear. An alert to FM radio channels will also be given for notifying those driving on similar routes.

With a view to facilitate cadaver organ harvesting and transplantation, the Minister for Public Health and Family Welfare, Dr Deepak Sawant and Minister for Road Transport Mr Diwakar Raote, both of the Shiv Sena decided to coordinate functioning of both departments to create 'green corridors' - lanes without red traffic lights dedicated to ferrying donated organs to the site of surgery.

On 3rd August, 2015 the first heart transplant in Mumbai in recent times (the first ever took place in 1968) was conducted on a 22 year old cardiomyopathy patient called Anwar Khan who received the heart of a 42 year old woman who had died in Pune of brain stroke - the donated heart was transported from Pune to Mumbai's Fortis Hospital in 90 minutes flat via green corridors in each city:

&gt; The heart left Pune's Jehangir Hospital at 2.38pm and at 4pm, doctors at Mulund's Fortis Hospital had started the transplant operation. It was brought to Pune's airport in seven minutes, flown by air ambulance to Mumbai in half an hour, and reached Mulund from the Santacruz airport in 18 minutes in a Fortis ambulance that was escorted by a Mumbai police jeep and motorcycle. The ambulance had taken 90 minutes to reach the airport from the hospital.

It took some good planning and deft handling of traffic in Pune:

&gt; Alerted about the need to quickly transport the heart — transplants must happen within four hours, the sooner the better, the city traffic police pressed into service close to 150 personnel in the well-coordinated operation to create the first green corridor in the city for a heart transplant.

&gt; An assistant commissioner of police was at the wheel of the pilot jeep and two traffic policemen rode ahead on a motorcycle. One lane all along the route was kept free and all signals were green, exactly the way it's done for movement of VVIP visitors in city.

And in Mumbai too:

&gt; After traffic police chief Milind Bharambe learnt about the heart being ferried, his department chalked out a detailed plan to pilot the ambulance. ""We spoke to the airport authorities in advance so that no time would be wasted once the heart was airlifted to Mumbai airport,"" said a traffic police official. Bharambe said they had expected the journey to take 25 minutes, but it was done in 18.


&gt; ""We arranged for the ambulance to enter and exit the airport premises from gate no. 8 at Kalina instead of waiting outside,"" said ACP Vijay Dhatrak, who drove the pilot jeep. ""We kept in touch with the police control room, which alerted the outposts before we were to pass through their jurisdictions. These officers were out on the road to keep one lane free for our team.""

Encouraged by the results, Dr Deepak Sawant declared hospitals will get a green corridor whenever they ask for it, and that a permanent one will be tried to be set up for all critical patients - ""If there can be green corridors for VVIP movement, there can most certainly be one for critical patients in need of immediate medical aid"".

Within a week, a second similar feat was achieved for another heart transplant:

&gt; A green corridor was created from Vashi’s MGM hospital to Mulund’s Fortis. It took 14 minutes and 9 seconds for the live heart to be delivered in the 19 km journey. It generally takes more than an hour to reach Mulund from Vashi in peak hours.

Recently, a green corridor from Aurangabad to Pune facilitated liver transplantation not once but twice this week:

&gt; Five days after a green corridor was set up from Aurangabad to Pune for a liver transplant at Ruby Hall Clinic, a similar exercise was conducted Friday afternoon.

&gt; Traffic authorities set up the green corridor from government hospital Aurangabad to Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital and a liver was transported in three and-a-half hours for the transplant operation.

&gt; “We faced a challenging situation today as there were at least 25 traffic signals from Wagholi to Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital,” Sarang Awhad, DCP Traffic told The Indian Express. On Sunday, the green corridor had helped bring the liver in three hours owing to less traffic.

&gt; “However today we had to ensure traffic coordination so that the ambulance reached the hospital within minutes. It took 19 minutes to cover a distance of 17.03 km,” Awhad said.

&gt; “There was perfect coordination among traffic authorities at Aurangabad and Ahmednagar and once the team of doctors reached the outskirts of Pune at Wagholi, the Pune traffic department took over,” he said.

Now, Maharashtra Health ministry plans to formulate protocols to smoothen cadaver organ transplant efforts. 

&gt; This includes fixed air-ambulance rates, GPS for road ambulances and traffic police coordination, a different siren colour and sound for ambulances, and appointment of nodal officers in each division in the police force to clear the way for documental proceedings.

&gt; With a slew of bureaucratic clearances, the process of inter-city and inter-state cadaver organ transplant, which is currently riddled with time-consuming formalities, is set to get faster and simpler.

&gt; In a high-level meeting with health minister Deepak Sawant on Wednesday, issues like delays from the police end were raised. “For cadaver transplant, a no-objection certificate is required from the local police. Every time, we have to explain to them what a cadaver donation is and make several phone calls to get the clearance,” said doctor Gauri Rathod who heads the state organ donation at Directorate of Health Services. The procedure is more cumbersome for inter-city transplants.

&gt; Now, a nodal police officer assigned for each division will be trained on what cadaver donation is and what documents are required for the procedure. “The nodal officer will be contacted to facilitate every transplant,” Rathod added.


&gt; With a thrust in inter-state organ transplant, the health ministry is also deciding on how an ideal green corridor can be created by finalising air-ambulance fares and fixed road transport protocol. Before extracting an organ, the traffic police will be informed an hour in advance. A GPS in the ambulance will help in navigation and a sticker will be put up on the ambulance to show it is carrying an organ. The health ministry is also considering changing the sound of siren in the ambulance to show urgency in getting a road cleared.

&gt; In order to create awareness among the public about these movements, the traffic police will be using the variable message signs (VMS) signboards and also public announcement systems to divert or alert motorists to keep paths clear. An alert to FM radio channels will also be given for notifying those driving on similar routes.

Dr Deepak Sawant has said they are trying to tie-up with airlines for air ambulance facilities as well, and are contemplating waiving off 20 per cent of the state taxes levied on airlines for air ambulances in case of inter-state transportation.

Good planning and coordination between Minister for Public Health and Family Welfare, Dr Deepak Sawant and Minister for Road Transport Mr Diwakar Raote both of the Shiv Sena, and their respective departments seem to be finally paying off. Mumbai could soon have a well-oiled cadaver organ donation and transplantation program running like clockwork.

The BJP is still a party of the middle class. In the last thirty years, this class has spread even in the rural areas. The growth of educational institutions, the tentacles of taluka and district level government offices, the spread of the banking sector, the rise of the computer and mobile phone generation and the aspiration of becoming metrosexual, particularly in the age group of 16 to 30, has generated **disdain for agriculture**. This new, rural white collar, non-agricultural class provided political backing to the BJP. But the rural economy, which supports this class is still agricultural. 

&gt; The cruel drought conditions and consequent devastation of the farmers, not only in Vidarbha and Marathwada, but even in the rest of the state, burst rudely the bubble of hope created by the blitzkrieg of the Modi  campaign. Farmers were also lured by the promise of high remunerative prices for the agricultural produce and bonus made by the BJP. The party knew that it was promising the impossible. But they convinced themselves that in elections and war, everything is permissible. The Congress and the NCP, despite their corruption and power-centric politics are still rooted in the soil. They still communicate in the language that farmer understands.

&gt; The new rural middle class and it’s urban counterpart, with their eyes focussed more on Mumbai or Manhattan, had lost touch, not only with the soil but also with their poor or lower middle class past. They had forgotten the days when there were no schools, colleges, banks, computer classes and the consumer culture so evident today. Just about 25-30 years ago, there was no STD booth, no xeroxing facility, no two-wheelers and erratic state transport services. Those in the age group of 40-plus have seen the days of scarcity and famine. Most of Maharashtra is a rain shadow terrain. Irrespective of who is in power, life in many parts is severe. All this had faded from memories. But harsh reality began to dawn on them in just one year. That reality check came not because of any Congress campaign or change of guard in the party. The widespread failure of crops, the absence of the governance that was so loudly talked about and sheer lack of sensitivity or even comprehension of the farmers’ problems in the ruling dispensation led to popular frustration and anger.

&gt; A video showing Bihar CM Nitish Kumar being hugged by a tantrik who also says 'Lalu murdabad' has not only gone viral but also given a potent weapon to the BJP-led NDA four days before the third phase of assembly election on October 28. The video is in stark contrast to Nitish's image of a modern, forward-thinking engineer-turned-politician.

&gt; The BJP is set to use the video in the last three rounds of the polls to drive home its point that the JD(U)-RJD-Congress Mahagathbandhan is a ""fragile and opportunistic alliance"". BJP spokesman Sanjay Mayukh said people of Bihar now know how Nitish is using occult science to remain in power.

**Kalyan-Dombivali**:

&gt; The BJP, on Tuesday, even organised a Yagna, which is supposed to bring success to them in KDMC polls.

Sudhir Dalvi, the driver of the Shiv Sena city chief Bhau Chaudhari was assaulted and glass panes of the vehicle were smashed. A motorcycle and some weapons were recovered by police at the scene of the crime. BJP candidate Vikas Mhatre and 60 others have been booked by Vishnu Nagar police in this regard.

Only a few hours after CM Devendra Fadnavis challenged 'show me where a single worker has ever assaulted anyone', this incident occurred on Friday [?] night at around 12.30 am. 'The mob that came to Garibacha Wada ['Locality of the Poor'] was carrying swords. They fired at our homes. Broke glass panes of windows', alleged residents of the locality. A few people have been injured in this attack. The Police, led by V. V. Laxminarayan, reached the spot in large numbers as soon as they got wind of it. 'We got very scared when the firing started. Grabbed the kids and  stood against the wall for dear life, for a long time. A bullet even passed by my daughter', a woman constantly pleaded with senior police officers.

**No arrests made.**

Shiv Sena leaders including Thane district Guardian Minister Eknath Shinde, MP Anil Desai, Shrikant Shinde, Naresh Mhaske rushed to the spot. No arrests were made at least till late Saturday. Vikas Mhatre has refuted his involvement and stated that he was in his home at the time of the incident, and even gave CCTV footage to the police to buttress his claim. But police said that such footage is officially not entertained.

**Making Bihar out of Dombivali**.

Since the CM himself had given a provocative speech saying 'we have not worn bangles. BJP workers should have no fear', BJP workers have gotten a go-ahead to indulge in such acts to terrorize people. Guardian Minister Eknath Shinde said it is condemnable that things have come to such a pass that in a city like Dombivali otherwise known for being cultured, elections are being fought on a Bihar pattern. MNS leader Nitin Sardesai commneted that democracy is being murdered in Corporation elections.

One of the quibbles 'activists' had about the raid was:

&gt; Another 21-year-old woman was slapped by a female police constable when she refused to pay the fine.

Tyrannical police persecuting helpless teenagers? Here:

&gt; One of the women had come with her fiance. Asked embarrassing questions, **she slapped one of the lady constables**. The lady constable hit her back.

[Source](http://www.ndtv.com/mumbai-news/cctv-footage-shows-mumbai-police-raid-on-couples-in-hotels-1205470)

In what right mind do you physically assault a police constable?! These are a familiar kind of classist people who believe they are superior than police constables - *tere jaise dus logon ko khareed loongi* ('I could buy ten people like you'). In fact, it is commendable the lady constable did not thrash the living daylights out of the assaulter.

.

&gt; 'They should fine the hotels'.

One grouse the 'activists' have is that the hotels should also have been fined if guests were found to have no proper ID and made misleading entries while checking in. From the same source:

&gt; Even the guest house staffers were fined.

.

That this is a localized event and you can still check into any hotel in Mumbai provided you fulfill requirements like carrying ID and making relevant entries was underplayed. This cleansing op was carried out by the police because:

&gt; ..complaints by locals regarding acts of ""public indecency"", soliciting and drunken ruckus. 

.


Interestingly, The Hindu has [omitted the part](http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mumbai-hotel-raids-spark-outrage-probe-ordered/article7519492.ece) about the lady constable being beaten up by a 'guest', while a publication that has made it known that they are in the business of advertising than news carries [a quote by just one political party](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Police-commissioner-orders-probe-into-detention-of-couples-from-hotel-rooms/articleshow/48417390.cms). Pertinent to note, polls to Asia's richest municipal body are due in 2017, student body of said political party has [just been formed](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/article7405104.ece?m=dtp) and their HQ in Delhi has just released a massive amount of money to be spent on PR - there's going to be a lot of obfuscation, muck raking and *dramebaazi* in the near future.
