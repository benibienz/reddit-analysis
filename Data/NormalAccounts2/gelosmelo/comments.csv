Lanturn, which is a water/electric type who can either have water absorb or volt absorb as an ability, so that checks electric types, and it raises your special attack. Lanturn knows soak, which turns the other Mon to a pure water type, and with rain active you can get in 100% accuracy, stab thunders. Usually ko's but takes a bit to set up, so I usually just thunder away lol. Then I went with a physical floatzel with swift swim. Out speeds a lot, and hits as hard as kabutops, which is highly recommended for a rain team. Those are the main ones I have, but like  /u/DavisWuhu said, it would be good to have a steel or dragon type. There are a bunch of things that will work well with rain, you just have to find them.
