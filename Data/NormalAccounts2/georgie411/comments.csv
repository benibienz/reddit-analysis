 The flip side of protecting innocent people from being convicted is that sometimes guilty people get off or get offered generous plea deals like this to avoid them getting off completely. The state likely felt it was more important to make this guy a registered sex offender than risk bringing a weak case against him. 

The upside is he's got 10 years on sex offender probation. That's not like the probation you get for a DUI. You have to follow a shit load of rules and the smallest mistake can send you to jail.

73,"That actually wasn't really a money grab. It was a loophole way to effectively make marijuana illegal at a time when they couldn't just pass a federal law banning marijuana. They passed a law saying you could only have ane sell marijuana if you paid for a special tax stamp for it, but they only made a tiny amount of those tax stamps available  effectively making it illegal.

It wasn't until later that the courts ruled the federal government could just ban a drug without passing a constitutional amendment. That's why prohibition of alcohol took a constitutional  amendment instead of congress just being able to pass a law making alcohol illegal.

So back then congress couldn't just pass a law banning marijuana, but the constitution gave the federal government power to levy taxes. Anti drug crusaders manipulated that power to pass a tax law that effectively made marijuana mostly illegal without explicitly outlawing it.

I can't believe CC didn't try out guest hosts before Jon Stewart left for good. John Oliver proved he could do the show (he only needed a few episodes to really get the hang of it) when Jon left to film his movie, but for some reason they didn't bother trying out other guest hosts when John Oliver signed with HBO. 

Also I think Noah is much more likely to get fired than Jon would have been those first two years. When Jon took over the show it wasn't remotely as big of a deal as it is now. CC can't afford to wait around and hope Trevor turns things around.

His research found that in a given encounter police are actually less likely to use deadly force against blacks than whites. The professor said it was the most surprising finding of his career. 

His research  did find elevated rates of lesser use of force on black suspects, but when it came to deadly force the research showed cops are actually more hesitant to pull the trigger on black suspects than white suspects. Even when accounting for several other relavant variables like suspect behavior and whether or not the suspect was armed.

He found that black people are killed at a disproportionate  rate only because they're stopped and arrested at a disproportionate  rate. Not because a cop is more likely to shoot a black suspect than a white suspect.

I agree we need more funding to better train police though. Many departments also need funding for higher salaries so they can attract better applicants.

Cops who don't feel like they're valued and respected are probably also going to be worse cops.

There's no requirments that the incitement of violence has to be directed against a protected class like race or sex.

Even if the language did explicitly  apply this to protected classes it's still a far cry from hate speech laws in other countries.

The courts have long held that the government can place reasonable restrictions on the place and time of protests. What the government can't do is discriminate against some protests just because they don't like the content of the speech invovled. The government has to provide reasonable accommodations for protests,but there are clear limits to what's considered reasonable.

The government certainly has the right to prevent protests that are trying to shut down an interstate. It doesn't matter how otherwise peaceful the group is being that's clearly illegal.  My understanding was this protest devolved into rocks and fireworks being thrown at cops. That's the reason for the misdeamenor 3rd degree riot charge, but they could have been arrested simply for being in the interstate and refusing to leave.

Dude in Baton Rouge  was being stopped because he apparently  threatened someone with a gun. It's not like the cops just pulled him over for a broken taillight like Philando. 

The Baton Rouge cops probably used bad tactics but they had a legitimate reason to try and arrest him and also a legimate reason to fear he could shoot them since the reason they were trying to arrest him is he threatened someone with a gun. The cops tried to get him to comply and things went south. The shooting still looks iffy  but we also can't see his right hand on the video so we can't tell whether he was reaching for the gun he had in his right pocket.

The Baton Rouge dude also had a good reason to avoid getting arrested, while Philando had zero reason to try and shoot the cop. The Baton Rouge guy had a long criminal record and had spent years in prison for things from statutory rape to domestic violence to several batteries. He even once was arrested for fighting with a cop. He was also about to go back to prison for a few years because he was a convicted felon illegally in posession of a handgun. It would have been the second time he was caught in possession of a gun as a convicted felon.

Also considering how long the guy's arrest record is it's not that unlikely that the cops knew who he was and knew he had a history of violent behavior. 

Philando had none of those reasons to resist arrest or shoot the cop because he wasn't breaking any laws and lawfully had the gun.
Philando was obviously just an innocent guy who got shot because a cop freaked out for little reason. The Baton Rouge case is much more iffy to me.

With that being said this guy makes an absolutely terrible poster child for protestors. He's a registered sex offender, wife beater, whos been arrested for several other batteries including one where he fought a cop and had an illegal gun fall out during the scuffle. He's got multiple felonies and to top it off he owes 30 grand in past due child support. 

No doubt though that this guy would still be alive had he just complied. You should always comply but you absolutely have to comply if you're carrying a gun. Even if youre licensed youre running a big risk of getting shot if you resist and then a cop notices the gun in the scuffle. 

Even if a cop is wrongly hassiling you (which wasnt the case here, but it's happened to me before) youve gotta just go ahead and comply. You can fight any violation of your rights in court. You cant fight them if you're dead. That's not to say you should just let them search your car or house though. Im talking about complying to commands to stop or sit down or put your hands behind your back. ",2016-07-07 06:01:04+00:00,d52hvca,2.0,t1_d51u0yu,36359.0,ImGoingToHellForThis

You can drop a baby off at designated locations and don't have to answer a single question if you don't want too.In fact in many states you can even invoke the safe haven law right after giving birth at a hospital. I just looked it up and Ohio is one of those states. In every state if you give birth outside of a hospital you can drop the newborn off at designated safe havens no questions asked. 

On top of that even without the safe haven law you can put the baby  up for adoption after a hospital birth. There just has to be a 72 hour wait that's designed to make sure birth mothers are sure they want to give it up. Newborn babies are in desperate demand so barring some serious birth  defects there's basically a 100 percent chance the newborn will go to a stable adoptive family instead of being raised in foster care. 

Desperate couples will even straight up pay birth mothers to pick them. Especially a healthy white sorority girl at a good university. There's people who will (illegally) pay mom's like that 50k or more to be chosen over other couples. It's common enough that there are even con artists out there who purposely get pregnant then promise the baby (and take cash) from multiple couples who think they're going to get the baby.

There are apparently some prisons that don't automatically give you enough pads automatically, but there's none that won't give you any if you don't have any money. 

According to the article there was one prison that only automatically gave you 10 pads a month, which is obviously really on the short side. It's the same thing with toilet paper. I've been to jail a few times in my younger days and the couple I was in didn't automatically give you enough toilet paper for how the average person uses it.

 It would be enough if you always used only two squares and never blow your nose with it , but how average people use it it wasn't enough. Especially since the nasty dusty jail really triggers your allergies and people are constantly spreading colds. Thing is there were always some guards you could ask who would get you more so it wasn't quit as terrible. Sometimes you'd have to hound them though.  I imagine it's the same with pads at places that are skimpy with how much they automatically give you. 

Soap was the same way btw. They'd give you this tiny bar that you were supposed to make work for two weeks, but like the toilet paper you could usually find a guard to give you extra. The best part is that shitty little bar of soap was also your shampoo. You had to actually have money to buy shampoo at the jails I was at. The worst part was the insanely short toothbrush they give you. You'd have to constantly scrape your nuckles  on your teeth to brush your back teeth. I think the reason for it was so you couldn't sharpen the bottom into a long shank.


This law is definitely  a good thing though. There's no reason places like public schools shouldn't be able to provide the cheap tampons and pads to students the same way they provide cheap toilet paper.

302,"There's not an official definition, but people who are currently 18 to 35 is the age range you usually see. It's the age range pollsters are using to find out who millennials are voting for. It's similiar to the same age ranges used for Generation X, Baby Boomers, and The Quiet Generation (also known as The Greatest Generation). Wikipedia says different researchers use slightly different age ranges but generally millennials are people born in the early 80s to around 2000. 

Also if you're late 30s you're not the same generation as your son. You're part of Generation X and your child is either a Millennial  or he's part of the next generation that hasn't been given a name yet. If he's 16 or 17 he'll be lumped in with the next generation. If he's 18 or 19 he's a Millennial.

If you happen to be born at the very beginning  of one generation then you certainly could have a child that's considered part of the same generation as you. Considering the age range is typically less than 18 years you'd have to have a pregnancy in high school though.

There are certainly significant  differences between the oldest millennials  and the youngest ones, but that's true with all generations. The oldest boomers (born around 1945) had significantly different childhoods than the youngest boomers. The oldest boomers were raised in the 1950s, while the youngest boomers were raised mostly in the vastly different 1970s. The level of social change between those two periods is vastly greater than the level of social change between the youngest and oldest millennials.

They have to pay a surcharge to the government that's well over 100 percent of the cost of the car. So if you want to buy a Honda Accord that would cost 30k  you actually have to pay around 70k.

They don't want to jack the prices way up and look like assholes. They also want shows to sell out fast because it's extremely good PR. In reality a show selling out really fast usually means shit loads of scalpers just bought tickets immediately.

A correctly priced face value ticket should result in tickets selling more slowly and there being a few left a couple days before a concert. Obviously if tons of seats are empty you priced too high, but some seats not selling can be a good thing. It probably was the result of actual fans directly buying your tickets instead of scalpers with bots buying them.

For artists who want to keep prices low, but sell tickets to actual fans you can require people attending the concert to swipe the card they used to purchase the ticket and provide photo ID. That way only the people who bought the tickets can get in. That's a more time consuming thing at the gate but some artists do it.

399,"""Have you ever heard read your rights bro""

Miranda Rights have to do with police interrogation. They're basically just meant to tell you that you don't have to answer questions if you don't want to and that you can also request a lawyer to be present during questioning. That doesn't mean you can demand to see a lawyer immediately just because you've been arrested. Miranda Rights also inform you of your general right to an attorney, but it's only something you have to immediately get if they want to question you after you've asked for an attorney.

For a shit load of arrests there's not even a need to read Miranda because they're not going to do any sort of questioning that they want to use in court. They only have to read you your rights if they want to use what you say against you in court. A lot of people erroneously think that if the cops don't read you your rights after arrest then that means the arrest was illegal and they have to let you go. That's not remotely true. 

So yes you have a right to demand a lawyer, but only if the police want to question you. In fact often times if you do demand a lawyer during questioning they won't even get you a lawyer right then. They'll just stop questioning you and you'll get taken back to jail. Eventually you will get to see a lawyer, but not necessarily real fast.",2016-06-09 04:00:59+00:00,d41vy17,9.0,t1_d41s958,6302.0,news

Raising a child with severe autism is about as difficult as parenting gets. You're not raising a quirky math geek who has a little trouble with social skills. You're raising someone who literally can't even communicate with you. They're completely dependent on you and 95 percent of the time the only emotion they'll express to you is anger. 

Raising a kid with downs syndrome is difficult, but raising a kid with severe autism is ten times harder. They're way more dependent on you than a down syndrome child, and while down syndrome children are often full of love and warmth you get the complete opposite from a child with severe autism. 

Watch some videos on YouTube  about kids with severe autism.

Both are wrong but the former is statutory rape, while the later is a much more serious crime that's generally punished much more severely. 

Also those studies dont seem to be taking into account the fact that kids have contact with far more teachers than priests so the risk of an average individual priest could still be significantly higher than the risk from an average individual teacher.

445,"It's not that significantly fewer men want to be with them because of their high job status it's because as their status rises the amount of men they find acceptable to marry decreases. Studies show that on average women care far more about marrying a higher or at least equal job status spouse than men. When you're a rich doctor there's very few available men with a higher status than you. There's more male doctors perfectly happy to marry a good looking female nurse. There's a lot fewer female doctors who would be happy marrying a good looking male nurse.

Keep in mind this is all just talking about average tendencies. There's definitely  some high job status women who are perfectly happy marrying a lower job status guy, and even a few who specifically  look for a guy who will stay home with their kids.


The similar example for men is that as their job status increases their expectations for how physically attractive their wife is increases. So the pool of women male doctors find acceptable also goes down as their job status rises, but the major difference is the pool of those attractive women interested in him significantly  increases as his expectations increase. For female doctors as their expectations rise the pool of men interested in them doesn't increase like it does for male doctors.

I don't doubt that sex addicts who are addicted to porn experience  problems as a result, but that's just common sense. Almost any addiction has negative effects on people's relationships  and life

Also other articles on the website make absolutely ridiclous  claims that have been debunked over and over again. For example they claim porn creates rapists, when actual research has disproven that multiple times. Some research has even suggested porn reduces rape.

Problems arise when people abuse it or its prescribed inappropriately high without slowly titrating  up. When taken correctly the side effects aren't that bad. The most common is constipation. 
 
One problem is when people abuse narcotic pain killers like Vicodin  or Percocet  that also have Tylenol in them. Tylenol is highly toxic to your liver in high doses.

It would only possibly be abuse if it was in the context of a severe and pervasive  pattern of other  highly controlling behavior.  Calling everything abuse diminishes  the seriousness of actual abusive behavior. 

I doubt there's even many Tumblr users who would say that just looking at a partner's phone is domestic abuse. Then again that's partly becauase phone snooping is typically associated with women. If it was the other way around they might agree with you. Even then I doubt most would say looking at someone's phone once amounts to domestic abuse.

 Granted odds are a single glass of wine probably won't hurt, but why even take the chance? A single cigarette or even a single line of coke probably won't hurt the baby either, but I don't see anyone arguing for those to be socially acceptable.

 Excessive consumption of alcohol actually causes more serious birth defects than crack addicted mothers. Crack babies come out underweight and agitated, but after a couple weeks of treatment they typically get better and develop normally. Fetal alcohol syndrome babies have serious permanent defects.

Men have to openly change clothes and go to the bathroom in your prescence as you walk by and look in each window. However the courts ultimately ruled male prisons had to hire female guards even though there were reasonable privacy reasons for only hiring men for direct contact in male housing units. Not to mention quite a few female prison guards have fallen in love with and been manipulated by male prisoners.

I doubt this camp counselor position invovles as much intimate contact with the opposite gender as a prison guard. Most companies just avoid this by not explicitly advertising what gender you want. Explicitly excluding a gender in the ad opens you up to a whole lot more risk of lawsuits.

The court ruling also applies to male juvenile prisons. So it's not just a matter of children.

Keep in mind the woman says in the article that she's been yelled at by other women when they wrongly mistook her as a man trying to come into the women's room. Do you think those women should have been able to shoot her just because they're overly paranoid about men?

In fact that article suggests the opposite may be true. That the realities of kids parents struggling more may have made them less likely to engage in risky behavior. I'm  not saying I definently agree with that, but that's what some researchers are saying.

The best birth control is convenient and cheap access to long term birth control for teen girls. Things like iuds  and depo  shots. Use of long term birth control has gone up significantly  as teen birth rates declined. Long term birth control is FAR more effective  than things that motivate kids to want to wait. The failure rate for IUDs  is absolutely miniscule compared to the failure rate for abstinence.


The article says researchers think widespread access to broadband Internet might have played a significant  role. Internet access gives kids easy access to information on contraception and how to get it without having to invovle your parents.

  I think society has such an interest in stopping teen pregnancy that we should make it available for free through high school partnerships with doctors offices.

658," If you read the article you'll see the stats showing highly educated Americans in general are far more liberal than other Americans. It's not just within the Democratic party.

31 percent of Americans with post grad degrees are consistently liberal. That's much higher than other education levels. Only 5 percent of Americans with high school or less are consistently liberal. That's not a small difference. That means postgrads are over 6 times more likely to be consistently liberal.

Edit:

To be fair to Republicans post grads is a broad category that includes a lot of degrees that arent necessarily considered especially difficult. People who major in things like Sociology and Women's Studies pretty much have to get graduate degrees to have any hope of employment in the field. Whereas there's other majors (that are often considered more difficult) where it's much easier to get a job with just a Bachelor's. Many of those majors attract people who are less liberal than people who major in  things like Women's Studies, Sociology, and many Humanities majors.

A lot of the majors that you have to get graduate degrees to get a job happen to be in the most liberal departments. I'd be curious to see the breakdown for certain post grads  like medical doctors. Something tells me they'd be substantially less liberal than post grads overall. I have no doubt theyd still be more liberal than average Americans, but i think more would fall into the ""mostly liberal"" category than ""consistently liberal"" category.

For personal auto insurance women work out to be the lesser risk (especially compared to young men) because on average they drive significantly  fewer miles and have lower risk of major accidents.

That bag doesn't look like more than a quarter ounce to me. It doesn't take that much to get that much smeared powder on his jacket. If you really look at the bag it's much smaller than you probably thought just glancing at it.

 Granted I was buying in Atlanta which is a big transit point for coke. I know in some other countries coke is way more expensive.",2016-04-08 19:19:36+00:00,d1vazba,3.0,t1_d1u253o,80748.0,WTF

874,"The forensics also apparently proved that the witnesses saying he was handcuffed were mistaken. Really goes to show how worthless eyewitness testimony can be. It's not even that people have to be trying to lie (although that certainly happens too), but people are also just really bad about remembering details of a dramatic and traumatic event. Studies show people wildly misremember details even when they're asked what happened immediately  after they saw it, and even when they're told beforehand they're going to be asked to provide details about  what they're about to see.

Some witnesses said he was handcuffed in the front. Some witnesses said he was handcuffed in the back. Some witnesses said he wasn't handcuffed at all. Others said only one of his hands was in a cuff.  The exactsame event and 20 witnesses  saw it so differently.

The forensic evidence suggests that what happened is the one cop was attempting to handcuff the suspect when the suspect bucked and tried to get away from the cop. They fell to the floor where the suspect was able to get his hand on the cops weapon. That cop was trying to prevent him from pulling out the gun when he told the other cop that he's got his hand on his gun. At that point the other cop people his weapon and ordered him stop. The guy didn't stop and the cop fired a single bullet.

The forensics showed he wasn't handcuffed both because he would have had at least some minor lacerations on his wrist if he was handcuffed during the scuffle, but also because of the blood splatter that was found on the cuffs. Forensic scientists determined the blood found on the cuff couldn't have happened if he was cuffed when he got shot. The cuffs had to be lying on the ground when he got shot.

Also keep in mind that they didn't just hassle this guy over bullshit like some other cases. The cops were called because he beat up his girlfriend and then attempted to physically prevent the EMTs  from taking his girlfriend to the hospital. That's the reason why they were trying to restrain him and arrest him.

This CNN article goes into pretty decent detail describing what happened.

875,"Obama has never advocated for seriously ending the war on drugs. He's never called for decriminalization or proposed any sort of law to stop people being arrested for drugs. I don't see why you think he would have done that with a different congress when he's not even calling for it. You'd only have a point if he was calling for it but congress was stopping him. He's not even proposing anything for congress to stop. 
  

The president isn't a king who can wave a wand, but they sure as hell are free to say what they want to happen. Obama hasn't said he thinks states should decriminalize  drugs. Obama hasn't said he thinks the federal government should stop arresting people for drugs either. Obama hasn't even called for the decriminalization  of marijuana much less full legalization. He sure as hell hasn't called for anything  remotely resembling ending the war on drugs.

He certainly could also use his position to lobby for congress to pass laws curbing the federal war on drugs. He could at least lobby for Marijuana to be removed from schedule I. 

I just don't get how he could flatly say that drug addiction isn't a criminal problem, but not follow it up by actually advocating for anything  resembling decriminalization  of drugs. I'm not saying he needs to call for fully legalizing drugs, but he should call for changing laws so that people will no longer be arrested for simply being drug users. Drugs can still be illegal without throwing people in jail just for using them. You don't have to let CVS sell heroin just because you stop arresting drug users.

Now I get that realistically this congress probably won't pass serious reforms to the drug war. All I'm asking is that he at least try. He doesn't even have to try that hard.

929,"Nixon wasn't *that* bad on drugs compared to Reagan/Bush/Clinton. He did start the push towards the drug war, but when he was president the federal government actually spent more money on treatment than enforcement. He wasn't the one who pushed the policies that so dramatically increased the prison population.  I was shocked to learn how liberal Nixon was compared to modern day republicans. Hell he was liberal compared to a lot of modern day democrats. Noam Chomsky has actually seriously called Nixon ""our last truly liberal president"".

Here's an article that talks about a lot of the surprisingly liberal things Nixon did:

934,"Richard Nixon was a liberal on a lot of issues compared to how far right wing a lot of republicans  are now. When Nixon ran  against JFK in 1960 Nixon was the one with the stronger record for civil rights. He also created the EPA, supported some affirmative action, substantially  raised the minimum wage, proposed  a national health care plan, expanded food stamps, proposed a negative income tax for the poor, enacted supplemental security income for the elderly and disabled, and a few other things I was surprised to learn about. Noam Chomsky  has even seriously called Nixon ""the last truly liberal president"" we've had.

If you think you'll likely pass then taking the breathalyzer isn't a bad idea, but if you absolutely know  you're going to fail badly then it's better to refuse. Do keep in mind though that in a few jurisdictions the police will actually get a warrant to forcibly draw your blood. It's much more likely that they won't though.

You're still going to go to jail if you refuse, but it's more likely you'll ultimately   get the charge dropped or reduced to reckless driving.  Certainly more likely than if you blow way over the limit. I interned with a criminal defense attorney for a year and so sat through a lot of DUI hearings. It's not at all unusual for a DUI to get plead down to reckless driving, and that certainly looks a lot better than a DUI on your record. If you blow three times the limit you're probably not going to get that reckless plea.

If you do refuse then they'll try and to find other evidence against you. They'll try to get footage of you acting like a drunk idiot in your cell. So shut the fuck up and just lay down and go to sleep until you sober up. 

If refusing to blow didn't give you an advantage in court then there's no way jurisdictions would spend the time and resources to have have a medical professional forcibly draw your blood. The cops and courts absolutely want you to blow, but many like to make it seem like you're just as fucked if you refuse.

Check out the PBS documentary The Dancing Boys of Afghanistan or a Vice documentary I can't remember the name of. 60 minutes also did a segment about how hard it is for the US military to get the Afghan police to do anything to stop men from raping boys. They interview several Afghani people who don't support the practice, but few understand why the Americans care so much about the rape of boys. One literally says ""if they don't fuck the boys who are they supposed to fuck their grandmother's pussy?"".

The New York Times reported last year that American soldiers were being ordered to ignore boys being raped by men unless the rape was being used as a weapon a war. Technically the Americans have no authority to stop Afghans from raping boys since that's a police issue. One US captain was kicked out of the service after he punched a boy raping Afghan Army officer in the face. He only resorted to punching him after trying in vain for months to get the Afghan authorities to stop him from raping his chai  boys.

Hillary was leading by a final polling average of plus 21. 

It's especially surprising since Michigan was relatively well polled. It's not like less important states that only have a poll or two done. Out of something like 10 relatively recent polls the closest any pollster got was  Hillary winning by 14. 

Im not saying this is the death of polling, but this is a legitimately shocking upset.

I agree that Hillary is still probably going to win, but one good thing for Sanders is we're done with the deep south, and that's by FAR Sander's weakest area. It's actually worrisome for the general election that Hillary is depending so much on these votes from the deep south.

 All of those votes in the democratic primaries there are effectively meaningless in the general election since democrats have basically zero chance to win those states in the general election. Especially since here's no proportional allegation of state delegates in the general election.

1085,"This raises red flags for the general election though. She should be dominating  a 74 year old Jewish socialist in almost every state, but so far she's only dominating him in deep south states. Those states matter the least in the general election, because there's zero chance states Ike Mississippi, South Carolina, or Alabama will go for a Democrat in the general election. There's also very little chance Tennessee, Arkansas, Georgia, or Louisiana will go for a democrat. So all these votes she's racking up in the deep south are basically meaningless for the general election. Especially since there's no proportional allocation of delegates in the general election. If you can't win the majority you get nothing from those voters.

She's doing surprisingly poorly in swing states against a completely unlikely candidate like Sanders. How the hell do you lose centrist Michigan to a candidate who calls himself a socialist? How do you lose a swing state like New Hampshire by 20 points to him? We're only an economic crisis or terrorist attack away from President Trump and that's pathetic.

Hillary will probably win, but she's a long way away from being done with this primary season. All her best states are over now that Mississippi voted today. There's nothing left in the deep south. There's some chance Sanders could win if we assume a lot of super delegates could be shamed into supporting the candidate who won their state and the majority of democratic voters , but it's likely Hillary will ultimately win barring something that could cause a major swing.

  Still you shouldn't downplay the importance of winning Michigan. The vote in Mississippi wasn't indicative of any change in momentum because she was expected to win huge there. Michigan on the other hand had polls showing Hillary up by 20 points just last week. I agree she's still likely to ultimately win the nomination though.

It spreads even easier because so many young black men are locked up that dating dynamics are completely skewed in young black men's favor. Theres simply way more young black women in the dating pool than young black men due to incarceration rates.

This is very different since it's the most conservative justice getting replaced by a democrat. Had RBG  died then it would have been easier for Obama to get a nominee through. If RBG died at the end of dubya's  presidency there would have most likely been a strong fight against whoever dubya nominated.

It's actually pretty rare for modern Supreme Court justices to die in office. Usually justices retire when their own party can replace them or at least die when their party has the presidency.

Black drug users live in crime filled ghettos that have constant police presence from all the violent crime. Of course drug users are more likely to get caught if there's constantly police around. It's not like cops just let white kids go when they catch them with a big bag of meth.

 Im white and was arrested a couple times for personal possession of pot when I was a teenager.  I was also arrested for personal possession of cocaine when I was little older. To this day Im a convicted felon for simply getting caught with a gram of coke. Nowadays i probably would have been sentenced to just drug court, but that didnt exist back then.

So yeah there is a probably valid point about drug crimes, but that doesnt apply to stuff like murder and other serious crime. There arent white people just being allowed to commit armed robberies and murders. For serious crime the data shows that it's not that white people and Asians just arent caught, but that black people genuinely do have vastly elevated rates for those crimes. Child molestation rates are pretty equal for blacks and whites, but for almost every other serious crime black Americans commit them at much higher rates

Now there can be a lot of reasons that help explain why black serious crime is so elevated, but there's zero doubt that it is off the charts compared to whites and Asians.

A 2 liter bottle of coke is US $3.55, which is apparently the most expensive average price for a 2 liter bottle of  coke in the world.

Like I said making minimum  wage in Australia is still better than making minimum  wage in the US, but making AUD $24 an hour isn't anywhere near the same as making US $24 an hour. It's not even like making US $17 an hour.

Movies that would be considered for oscars almost all come from America, western europe, and Asia. Of all those places the US has by far the highest concentration of black people. Yes African movies can win Oscars, but the amount of big movies coming out of Africa is comparatively tiny. There's not really a big budget movie industry in Africa. Certainly nothing remotely comparable to the  size and financing of Hollywood. And we're also really only really talking about sub Sahara Africa since North Africa is overwhelmingly Arab not black.

 Most non American movies nominated for Oscars are European, and Europe has far less black people per capita. Japanese and Chinese movies occasionally  get nominated, but they have almost no black people in those countries.  Including other countries with big film industries should actually drive the expected black  proportion of nominees down a little. Not too much though since the vast majority of nominees are still American movies.

"" Oscar nominations have not dramatically under-represented black actors. Instead, they have greatly over-represented white ones. Blacks are 12.6% of the American population, and 10% of Oscar nominations since 2000 have gone to black actors. But just 3% of nominations have gone to their Hispanic peers (16% of the population), 1% to those with Asian backgrounds, and 2% to those of other heritage""

So black actors are under represented in Oscar nominations, but not anywhere near as badly as Asians and Hispanics. Interestingly  though black actors since 2000 have actually won a slightly disproportionate  share of oscars since 2000.

1452," I think one of the biggest problems with getting reparations passed is there's not just a black white divide in America anymore. There's almost 150 percent more hispanics in America than black people. There's also a steadily growing east Asian and Indian population. It's probably going to be especially hard to sell those groups on tons of their tax dollars being used for reparations  when neither they nor their ancestors had anything to do with American slavery. 

So even if you could somehow convince enough whites you've still got to convince other minorities who really have no reason to personally feel guilty over slavery. And the non black/white population is growing very fast so it's just going to get even harder. Even without the surge of other minorities some sort of large reparations  bill is so unlikely to pass that it makes single payer look like a slam dunk in comparison and of course single payer isn't  actually a slam dunk.

One other problem is the black population is too small to influence politicans while being too large for a reparations type deal to be really affordable. The fact that the Republican party has completely alienated black voters doesn't help either since black voters are so solidly democratic that there's not even an attempt to fight over them in the general election.",2016-01-23 02:35:21+00:00,cz8joo0,4.0,t1_cz8jfho,489.0,politics

Differences in pay negotiating also might make up a small part. There's some research showing women are more likely to just take the first pay offer instead of negotiating for pay or asking for raises more frequently.

Apple is quite diverse compared to the diversity of the people who actually get tech degrees. Especially when you consider diversity in tech majors was even less ten years ago then now.

Maybe schools need to do more to recruit non asian/white  males to tech majors, but you can't blame that all on Apple. A lot of universities  are already making great efforts to increase diversity in tech majors. A recent study came out that found women who apply for a tenure track professorship in STEM fields are much more likely to get hired than similarly qualified men who apply for a tenure track professorship in a STEM field.",2016-01-16 19:07:02+00:00,cz0msxb,3.0,t1_cyzo5a5,78629.0,news

Just like it wouldn't make any sense to hire a bunch of IT guys to work as nurses so that nurses are more diverse.

Their diversity on average is actually far better than the diversity of people who actually get tech degrees so they're obviously making a big effort for diversity  already.

So if you're getting FAFSA grants and then get a  drug arrest then you lose the aid,  but if you were never getting federal aid then you can still get FAFSA grants with a felony drug conviction  on your record.

Also it's specifically drug crimes not just any felony that causes you to lose federal aid you were already  receiving. On top of that the laws were reformed in 2009 so that even if you lose federal aid from a drug crime it's only a temporary loss. You can reapply for it after a year or two or after going through a drug education class type deal. I think you have to fuck up 3 times before it's an indefinite  ban from federal student aid, but even then there's still a way to get the ban lifted.

In NYC the school department has a dedicated part of a building where they send teachers they want to fire. The teachers go and sit in a room and do nothing, but as long as they show up they get paid their regular  salary. The process to fire them can take many months to even years.

It's the same thing with cops in a lot of districts. Their contracts make it hard to fire them so when they're in serious trouble they're usually just put on desk duty or paid leave while the process works its self out. If they're convicted then they're outright fired, but sometimes simply being charged isn't enough to fire them.

Relevant passage:

Kvinnan var först tveksam till att göra polisanmälan, men övertalades av personalen. När tåget stannade i Hudiksvall stod polis på plats. Mannen greps och häktades.

Translated:

The woman was at first hesitant to report it to the police but was persuaded by the personnel [working at the train]. When the train stopped in Huddiksvall the police were waiting. The man was arrested and taken into custody.

Various sources cite the court protocol in which elaborates:

Tågvärden frågade om han skulle ringa till polis. Till en början ville hon inte det, eftersom hon inte ville sätta N.N., som är asylsökande, i en jobbig situation. Hon tyckte synd om honom [...] och var rädd att han då skulle utvisas till Irak.

The train attendant asked if he should call the police. At first she didn't want to, since she didn't want to put [the rapist], which is an asylum seeker, in a tough situation. She felt sorry for him [...] and was afraid he'd be deported to Iraq.

I have not read the court protocols myself but the story holds up and I'm sure ""anti-racist"" sites had been quick to debunk it if it was a fabrication. The reason she knew about the rapists situation was because they had been talking earlier, he had made a sexual advance but she had pushed him away.

Not to mention all the unsavory characters the illicit heroin market funds.  I think our first priority should be to reduce harm and deaths.

We could have at least just clamped down on new prescriptions while ensuring that people already dependent on oxycodone could have continued to get their medication at the doses they were used to. Instead we turned them all into criminals, and they in turn started behaving like criminals to support their addiction.

Also Ive got some personal experience with this. I'm a 7 year clean heroin addict. People usually get clean and stay clean on their own terms.

Check out this article:

http://news.investors.com/politics-obamacare/060514-703595-obamacare-individual-mandate-loophole-cbo-finds.htm

If you can structure your taxes so that you don't get any return then there's no enforcement mechanism in place to make you pay the penalty. They can't lock you up or garnish your wages or anything like that. The enforcement mechanisms that apply to normal taxes don't apply to the ACA penalty for not having insurance.

On top of that you can also qualify for hardship exemptions. You probably make too much to qualify for the standard hardship exemption, but there's other loopholes. If you've been a victim of domestic violence you get the hardship exemption. The thing is you don't have to provide any documentation or police reports or anything like that. You just have to put that you were a victim of DV.

1756,"I've heard there's technically no legal mechanism in place to force you to pay the penalty. They automatically take it out if you're getting a tax return, but if you can set up your taxes to where you don't get anything back then you might be able to avoid it. I'm no expert but I saw a news segment about this. Apparently the way the ACA was written there's no enforcement mechanism for the penalty so they can't lock you up over not paying it or garnish your wages or anything like that. Apparently the enforcement mechanism that applies to normal taxes you owe doesn't apply to the penalty for not having insurance.

Edit:

Found an article on it.

"" In addition, the law forbids the IRS from using its normal enforcement tools to collect unpaid penalties. Tax experts say the best it can do is withhold the penalty amount from any tax refund due.""


http://news.investors.com/politics-obamacare/060514-703595-obamacare-individual-mandate-loophole-cbo-finds.htm

I think they purposely left this loophole in place to avoid a situation where someone goes to jail for purposely refusing to pay the fine in order to protest the law. I assume they thought that would look bad politically and purposely didn't give the IRS real enforcement  authority.

On top of that there's an exemption to the fine altogether if you don't make much money. Apparently 87 percent of uninsured people qualify for the exemption.

Even more surprisingly you can find other loopholes to qualify for the hardship exemptions even if you make too much money. Apparently you can claim to be a victim of Domestic Violence and get the hardship exemption despite you not having to provide any documentation or police reports to substantiate  your claim.

From the same article:

"" The hardship exemption rules, for example, let anyone who ""experienced domestic violence"" avoid the mandate, without providing any documentation of abuse. Getting a shut-off notice from a utility is also sufficient to claim a hardship exemption.""",2015-12-29 03:36:09+00:00,cyekg75,3.0,t1_cyeahoi,16941.0,news
1757,"Yeah this is great advice for anyone regardless of their gender. It's especially true for men that if they're lonely they're absolutely going to have to be assertive and risk getting their feelings hurt, but it's also true for anyone who's not having partners they're interested in asking them out. Unless you just want to pray Mr perfect comes to you, then you've got to risk getting rejected. You've got to risk feeling awkward. You've got to risk feeling uncomfortable. You just have to remember that feelings are temporary. You're not going to never recover just because someone rejects you.

If you're that afraid of flouting 1950s gender dynamics  then at least try and make it abundantly clear that you like someone if you really want them to ask you out. Many men are just as nervous as you and will only ask someone out if they're pretty positive what the answer will be. Shyness and passivity is not rewarded in the dating market no matter your gender. It might have been rewarded somewhat for women in the 1950s, but not these days. If it's rewarded for any women these days then it's only the women interested in dating the vanishingly  small amount of men that believe in very strictly  traditionalist gender roles.

The only discussion going on is removing gun rights for the very tiny percentage of mentally ill people who have been declared seriously and dangerously mentally ill AND forcibly committed against their will by a judge. It is extremely hard to commit people against their will.

 A decent  amount of people are taken to mental hospitals on temporary holds for evaluations, but only a small percent of them are found seriously mentally ill enough for a judge to keep them forcibly committed against their will.  We wouldnt have tons of mentally ill homeless people if it was easy to get a judge to order someone forcibly committed against their will . Mentally ill homeless people used to just be swept up and sent to mental hospitals, but decades ago the courts made it so forcible commitment could only be used in very narrow and extreme circumstances. This type of ban wouldn't affect anyone who just voluntarily gets treatment for their mental health illnesses. 

I support gun rights, but I don't think there's anything remotely extreme about denying gun rights to the tiny percentage of people who are so mentally ill they've been committed to a mental hospital by a judge. It's  not about guns themselves.

Even in the hardest on pot states getting caught isn't as big of a deal as you seem to think. In the few worst states you will actually get arrested if caught, but basically everywhere let's first time personal marijuana users take a first offenders plea where it won't go on your record. Mosy big city police departments won't even bother arresting someone over personal pot posession. They'll typically just throw it away unless you're a dick or commiting other crimes.

I was a drug addict in my younger years and pretty much everyone I know who got busted with pot was doing something stupid like smoking in the car (like i did when i got busted with a friend) or being stoned and driving with it in their pocket.

He should probably be fired but 10 years in prison was a huge stretch over the facts in the case. All they can really prove is that he didn't buckle him in, but there's not a law requiring him to buckle suspects in its only an adminstration guideline (and that guideline didn't even exsist until literally a few days before the incident). They can't actually prove that Gray needed medical attention when he asked for it. It's likely he did but criminal cases are about what you can prove.

 He's got built in reasonable doubt because it's possible the injury didn't happen till before the last stop. The state medical examiner said they thought it likely happened earlier, but the defense had their own medical examiners to offer the opposite guess. The defense medical experts said the injury couldn't have happened before Gray asked for help because the injury he sustained would have made it impossible for him to speak. 

The only way I see them getting any convictions  is if they have evidence that the driver was purposely driving erratic to rough up Freddie Gray. Nothing like that came into this trial, but it's possible it will in the trial of the driver. If they have evidence the driver purposely drove crazy then he's probably the one who will actually get convicted.

Part of that is the legacy of segregated swimming pools  and part of it can even be attributed to black women not wanting to mess up their expensive to maintain hair. Another part of it is Black Americans have much more fear of the water, which perpetuates the cycle of not being able to swim since parents are too afraid to let their kids swim.

Anecdotally I took a swimming class in college. There were about 7 or 8 people who didn't know how to swim at all. All were African American. It's actually a pretty real societal problem, because black people who can't swim die from drowning on a decently regular basis. In fact black children age 5 to 14 die from drowning at a rate three times higher than white kids.

Edit

I did a quick Google and found out 70 percent of black Americans can't swim.

Edit:

Also in 2012 there were mass shootings in France targeting Jewish civilians and French soldiers. 7 were killed and 5 more were wounded. It was actually a series of separate attacks, but at least one would qualify as a mass shooting since at the attack on the Jewish daycare center 4 people were killed. Three of those 4 were little kids.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toulouse_and_Montauban_shootings

America  certainly has more mass shootings in total numbers, but it's not quite as rare as some people seem to think in europe. America especially has a ton of mass shootings that are gang/drug related incidents. 

Edit 2: 

Also there was another incident that happened this April in France. A muslim  man was attempting to go on a mass shooting spree at two churches in France. He was armed with an AK47  and a few other weapons. He hijacked a car to use and killed the driver. Fortunately the idiot accidentally shot himself in the leg before he could shoot up the churches.

1974,"My problem with them is their grand standing about how we have to pass these bills to save lives, but they're not actually proposing anything that would stop many of these incidents. I'd have a lot more respect if they were outright calling to ban guns because at least then their policies would match their rhetoric. 

They're trying to have their cake and eat it too by calling for modest reforms while acting like their proposals would dramatically reduce gun violence in America. That way they still get to say they support law abiding gun owners, while acting like they're proposals are going to make a huge difference.

The reality is universal background checks would do extremely little to stop these mass killings. Most of these mass killers don't even have a felony record before they snap. On top of that universal background checks don't do shit to stop straw purchasers  who legally buy guns and then give them to felons. Doing that is already a crime, but very few people are caught doing it. Most gun murderers are happening in gang ridden inner cities where they're already buying weapons from other people who passed background checks. Universal background checks wouldn't change that.

It also annoys me because they're grand standing on this issue only after the Republicans took back control of congress. The president had 2 full years where he could have pushed for these bills when the dems  controlled the house and had a filibuster proof super majority in the Senate. They could have passed anything they wanted even with zero republican votes. Yet they wait until they know it won't be passed to make a huge push for it. 

Part of me really feels like they don't really want these bills to pass because they want to be able to keep using them as a political weapon. If they actually passed their modest gun control reforms then to grandstand on gun control would require them to actually propose hardcore gun restrictions, which would be deeply unpopular in swing states.

I think it's much better  than just smearing all of the left because of the actions of  campus SJWs. There are many lifelong liberals in the media who are now speaking   out against the modern campus ""social justice"" types.  They're disgusted  because the SJWs engage in all sorts of behavior and idealogy that is at odds with bedrock liberal beliefs in stuff like due process, free speech, and respect for mutual discourse. 

I've read at least half a dozen articles in just the past couple months written by lifelong liberals disgusted with the campus antics of SJWs.  Real liberals don't shout down people they disagree with. Liberals in the 1960s protested and fought their schools for the right to free speech on campus. These SJWs are protesting to roll back those rights real liberals won in the 60s. They throw a hissy fit anytime someone they don't agree  with is invited to speak on campus, and sadly schools are frequently caving to those hissy fits.

The Atlantic published an especially good article outlining the problems real liberals have with this current crop of campus SJWs:

If she reportst this to police then they might go and talk to the woman to check her out, but thats it.

Had she written to an abortion clinic and wrote "" I'm willing to bomb your clinic"", then yeah she really might get arrested for that. Partly because there's proof she said it and partly because the context makes it clear that it was a threat meant to intimdate and scare the clinic. Just saying you're willing to bomb an abortion clinic to somone (as opposed to the clinic or it's employees) isnt going to send you to prison when theres not even proof you said it.

2017,"Many states (even California) have passed laws against racial preferences for public university admissions. Some schools in those states still find creative ways to give preference to black students, but for the most part its private universities that have the most extreme affirmative action policies.  

There was research done a few years ago that found  Asian applicants had to score something like 350 points higher on their SATs to have the same chance at getting accepted to top Ivy League schools as a black applicant. Whites had to score something like 310 points higher. Keep in mind we're talking math and verbal only. So its only out of 1600 not 2400. That's a massive preference. 

I support affirmative action if it means giving a tie or a near tie to the underrepresented minority, but giving someone a 350 point boost is insane. Not only is it unfair to Asians and Whites, but it also sets up black students for failure. Theyre having to compete against students who are out of their league academically and it results in them having much higher college drop out rates. Even for the students that dont drop out theyre much more likely than Asians and Whites to have to switch to an easier major.

I know I would have really struggled to compete at a place like Yale or Harvard and the most i could have even gotten was a 250 point boost. Id also point out struggiling to that degree just creates even further alienation from the rest of the school.

Of course theres also the issue of qualified black students being treated like they got in only out of charity. Even faculty and students who strongly support Affirmative Action can subconsciously view and treat black students differently without realizing it. On top of that the students admitted because of racial preferences themselves may subconsciously view themselves as inferior and make it even harder for them to suceed.

2298,"It would have to be a self imposed thing collectively  agreed to by major media outlets. Just like they voluntarily  refuse to name alleged sexual assault  victims they could just as easily voluntarily  refuse to report the accused person's name until a conviction or at least until charges are actually brought. Expecting them to withhold the name until after trial is probably unreasonable, but they could possibly be shamed into not disclosing  an accused ' s name during the initial investigation  right after an allegation. If evidence exsists  and charges are brought then it's  more reasonable to name them after that point.

All of this would have to be voluntarily done. Possibly through new self imposed journalistic ethics guidelines that major media outlets generally adhere too. This wouldn't stop non mainstream media from naming the accused. It wouldn't make it a crime to report the person's name.

The statement or action has to be closer to inciting  violence or harrassment  to get you expelled from a public university. Hanging a noose from a tree and calling for people to be lynched is a good way to get expelled, but making a political argument that's offensive to black people is generally protected. As long as you aren't making threats of violence or harassing individual students you're generally protected. Writing the n word on a black student's dorm door can get you expelled, but even something as extreme as arguing that jews made up the Halocaust is  generally protected  speech at a public university.

What you say absolutely can get you fired from most jobs though. In my state employers can fire people at basically anytime for almost any reason. As long as the reason isn't your race, religion, or ethnicity then bosses are free to fire you for even the dumbest reasons.

Even if there's pretty solid evidence  against you the difference between talking to the detectives and asking for an attorney is often the difference between 15-20 years and life without parole.

If you have very light thin eyebrow hair  you have to fill them out. The difference is dramatic . 


If you watch those beauty channels on YouTube you'll see the biggest difference  is simply when they haven't filled out their eyebrows  for many of the women. Women can go from slightly average to smoking with 10 minutes of  proper makeup .

That led the most shameless addicts like myself to switch to shooting heroin just for a stronger high. So heroin use was already elevated, but then the DEA started cracking down on pain pills and now the people who didn't want to try heroin have switched to it because they simply can't get pain pills for a reasonable price like they could in the late 90s and early 00s.

So it's two fold. An increase in pain pill abuse led to an inital surge in heroin use. Then the hard crack down on pain pills has led to a second surge in heroin use.

The people I feel the most for are the legitimate chronic pain patients who are having to jump through all sorts of hoops just to find doctors who will proscribe what they need and pharmacies that will fill it now.

Anything that acts as a form of political speech gets the highest protection from the courts. These kids could argue that their shirts are a form of political  speech, and it's possible the courts could agree with them. I'm not saying they will only that it's not 100 percent cut and dry.

Edit:

Apparently different courts have ruled differently on confederate flag cases in schools. Schools need to prove it will likely cause a serious problem and the ban also can't be targeted. Anything racially offensive to other groups (including whites) would have to also be banned, which this school code apparently does.

This particular school says they had incidents of racial violence in 2002 related to the flag.

These days you've typically gotta be completely unstable to be held against your will at a psych hospital for more than a 48 to 72 hour hold. People who genuinely are out of their mind and a threat to others are often released after a couple days precisely  because it's so hard to keep someone against their will. There are many parents of disturbed adult children who desperately try to get their child treated at a psych hospital only for them to be released after a day or two because they're not crazy enough to be held against their will. 

A little while ago a Virgina  politican was murdered by his adult son one day after the dad tried to have his son committed for treatment. They took his son in only to release him in a few hours after the deemed he couldn't be held against his will despite well documented disturbed behavior. 

I'm not saying committing people should be an easy process. All I'm saying is its typically very much not easy to hold someone against their will in a psych hospital for more than a 48 to 72 hour hold. She was held for 8 days.

Bernie's proposed policies are well in line with liberal progressives so why he continues to call himself a democratic socialist  is beyond me. Either he sees his policies as a stepping stone to socialism or he's moderated his views but still hung onto the democratic  socialist label for consistency.

Edit

This Daily Kos  article explains the differences between social democrat and democratic socialist . 


   ""There are essentially two types of socialists in modern Western democratic politics. Social democrats are effectively what the left is in nearly every Western European and North American country. They might find socialism laudable, but have made peace with enacting changes to capitalism to make it more equitable. Social democrats enacted policies typically referred to as the mixed economy or welfare state, such as Social Security and universal health care. While U.S. Democrats don't use these labels, social democrats generally define the center-left of the political spectrum in the West.

Democratic socialists on the other hand are typically seen as more radical left-wingers and advocate the outright replacement of capitalism with socialism.""

2612,"Isn't there some evidence that male intelligence has more variability  than female intelligence? As in men are both more likely to be extremely stupid and extremely smart? Men and women still average equal intelligence it's just there's more men on both extreme ends of the spectrum. 

Edit

Apparently there are studies that have found exactly what I'm talking about, but it's not considered a settled matter.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_intelligence


""Some studies have concluded that there is larger variability in male scores compared to female scores, which results in more males than females in the top and bottom of the IQ distribution.[14][15] This remains a controversial claim.[16]""

2613,"""Gijsbert Stoet and David C. Geary reviewed the evidence for the stereotype threat explanation of the achievement gap in mathematics between men and women. They concluded that the relevant stereotype threat research has many methodological problems, such as not having a control group, and that the stereotype threat literature on this topic misrepresents itself as ""well established"". They concluded that the evidence is in fact very weak.""


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat#Failures_to_replicate_and_publication_bias


"" Whether the effect occurs at all has also been questioned, with researchers failing to replicate the finding. Flore and Wicherts concluded the reported effect is small, but also that the field is inflated by publication bias. They argue that, correcting for this, the most likely true effect size is near zero (see meta-analytic plot, highlighting both the restriction of large effect to low-powered studies, and the plot asymmetry which occurs when publication bias is active).""

I'm not any sort of expert on this. Just pointing out it seems far from established that stereotype threat is the main cause of these performance  differences. A few small studies that don't even have control groups have gotten a lot of attention  while larger studies with control  groups  with less exciting results seem to have been largely ignored. This is quite typical for how research studies get reported in the media.

2694,"If Zimmerman pulled the gun on Trayvon then how did he end up letting an unarmed guy beat the shit out of him? It makes more sense that he only pulled the gun after Trayvon knocked him to the ground and was hitting him. We know based on witness testimony that seconds before the shooting Trayvon was on top of Zimmerman ""beating him MMA style"". We know from the same witness that Zimmerman was screaming out to him for help. That witness went in to call 911 and mere seconds after he went inside the shot was fired.

It's possible Zimmerman tried to tackle or punch  Trayvon and that's what started everything, but it seems quite unlikely that he pulled a gun and that's what started everything.

Since there was no evidence to prove Zimmerman attacked Trayvon first the jury came to the only solution they could, which was to find him not guilty. Really there was no evidence to prove Zimmerman hit Trayvon whatsoever  before the shot was fired. Trayvon didn't have a mark on him other the gun shot wound and injuries to his hand from punching zimmerman.

Also the entire point of Basic Income is that it's not supposed to punish people for working. That only works if everyone gets Basic income. Taxing middle class people 100 percent on the Basic Income gets rid of the whole point. ",2015-08-20 20:24:39+00:00,cu9vv09,3.0,t1_cu9ntrc,11955.0,news
2763,"Yeah Basic Income is only practical if it completely  replaces every other welfare program out there. The Basic Income amount would also have  to be substantially less than the maximum amount of expenses current welfare programs would pay for. One benefit is it would get rid of the hugely expensive bureaucracy  surrounding current welfare schemes. There would no longer be a need for the tens of thousands of paper pushers who go through welfare applications and track whether people are still qualified.

The main benefit of Basic Income over current welfare schemes is that it creates zero disincentive  for people to work. There is no downside in taking a job with Basic Income. Under current welfare schemes people are often basically penalized for working. The amount they lose in benefits from working is often less than the extra money they get from working a low wage job.

There's probably no way Basic income is practical in the US without significantly raising taxes. Finland is a different story because Finland already has massively more generous welfare benefits than the US. Their costs are already so high that Basic Income could possibly even save money if it completely replaces all other welfare programs in Finland.

2765,"Well the basic income rate set will probably be lower than the max amount people could get from various welfare programs combined. The costs of implementing all those welfare programs would also all be slashed if basic income was passed. You don't need a huge bureaucracy with tens of thousands of paper pushers for a program that everyone automatically qualifies for. There's no application process and no conditions to keep getting basic income. Everyone gets it no matter how much they make, and if passed Basic Income would replace every welfare program. 

Also the main potential benefit is there would no longer be a perverse incentive for people not to work. Under most welfare schemes working a certain amount can actually lower your net income because you lose welfare programs you were on. With basic income there is no downside for people working. People wouldn't be punished for working with Basic Income.

I'm not saying it's practical in America. All I'm saying is its an interesting  concept, and would almost certainly result in more  people working than current welfare state schemes. This is more practical in Finland since welfare benefits are already extremely generous  so replacing welfare with basic income is not only feasible but could possibly even save money long term. In the US welfare benefits aren't generous enough for us to replace them with basic Iincome without substantially  raising taxes.

Basic Income has aspects that appeal to both liberal and conservative economists.",2015-08-20 19:57:10+00:00,cu9uqxq,5.0,t1_cu9rvfo,4299.0,news
2766,"Well the main benefit of basic income is there is zero downside for people taking jobs. Whereas most welfare schemes make people lose benefits if they start working a certain amount. Of course the cost  of providing every single person this basic income means that this program will need to greatly increase low income workers taking jobs to be practical. The other main benefit is it completely slashes the cost of implementing and regulating all the welfare programs. The bureaucracy  that could be cut would save a lot of money. You don't need a huge bureaucracy to implement basic income because everyone qualifies for it so there's job screening process or rules for staying on it.

2778,"Surprisingly  non combat veterans have pretty close rates of suicide to combat vets. I'd imagine the type of person who chooses to join the military is just more prone to suicide. People who join the military on average probably have relatively aggressive and risk taking personalities. On top of that a lot of people who sign up have gone through some hard times  and are looking to get their life back on track. Stuff like higher rates of alcoholism and drug addiction  increase suicide risk. As do troubled childhoods in general. There are tons of guys who this doesn't apply to in the military, but I'm just talking about rates compared to the general population

Also pretty much everyone in the military is familiar with and has access to a gun. Guns don't necessarily increase the chance you'll attempt suicide, but they certainly increase the odds you'll actually succeed  in killing yourself. People who do stuff like swallow a bunch of pills  frequently end up surviving, but very few people survive a gun shot to the head. Ironically I actually know a guy who did, but he's missing an eye and a chunk of his face.

Edit 

In fact this study found soldiers  who saw combat were no more likely to commit suicide than soldiers who didn't based on data from 2001 to 2007.

Federal legalization by Congress will have almost zero impact on marijuana users in states where state law says it's illegal. Only a Supreme Court decision ruling pot laws unconstitutional would legalize at the federal and state level at the same time.


Other than that I completely agree with you. Holding out for a perfect deal is hella risky. Marijuana reform is thriving on momentum and a state like Ohio successfully legalizing is of massive importance. Likewise if it fails its a huge blow to the momentum legalization has.

Just because theres an open window for legalization right now doesnt mean it will stay that way. Political winds can and do shift.

Some on the feminist left think that sex workers themselves should never be arrested, but that police should go after buyers aggresively.

2881,"Is there actually any evidence that incest is higher in those states? I could maybe see stuff like marrying cousins (FDR style) as being more common since those are rural states where population is loosely spread out. If you live in a town of 100 people the odds of fucking a second cousin probably go way up. However do cousins even count as incest? I thought it had to be a more direct relationship like mother and son or brother and sister to be considered incest? 

I would imagine the vast majority of incest is parents molesting their children. The odds of that happening are probably closely tied to rates of pedophilia, and as far as I know pedophilia is pretty evenly spread out among economic classes. Pedophilia also doesn't follow the typical racial disparity that most violent crimes do. Poorer groups like African Americans arent more likely to commit acts of pedophilia than whites.

 The percentage of incest where parents  sleep with their adult children is probably tiny compared to the amount of parents who molest their young children. So I would imagine rates of pedophilia would be the best indicator of overall rates of incest.

Edit

I did some Google searches and couldn't find any sort of state stats on incest, but I might have missed something.

""I support the Brady bill and I urge the Congress to enact it without delay. It's just plain common sense that there be a waiting period [7 days] to allow local law enforcement officials to conduct background checks on those who wish to buy a handgun.""

He said this when daddy bush was in office in spite of Bush being publicly opposed to the Brady bill.

Reagan also publicly supported an assault weapons ban in 1994.

3046,"You could still have Herpes and HPV. Those aren't tested for by routine STD blood tests, and tons of people who get them never have physical symptoms. It's especially common not to get any physical symptoms (genital warts) from HPV.

Unfortunately HPV and Herpes are just risks you have to accept if you want to be sexually active with anyone. Condoms don't even really protect you much because both spread from skin to skin contact in the genital region as opposed to just bodily fluids. Well over half of all sexually active adults get HPV at one point in their life.

 Fortunately for the vast majority of people it's no big deal. Although a very small percent of men do develop throat cancer from HPV (from going down on women) and a small percent of women develop cervical cancer. For women as long as they get routine pap smears any abnormal cells on their cervix can be tackled quickly. 

Herpes has a higher chance of actually causing physical symptoms than HPV, but the actual problems caused by it are very minimal. If youre wondering why your STD screens didnt include a test for Herpes (or HPV) its because the CDC actually specifically recommends against herpes being tested for in standard screens. 

The reasons for this are a combination of there not being very accurate genital herpes tests, genital herpes being a relatively minor nuisance, and  there being no cure for genital herpes. Combine in the fact that condoms don't prevent the spread of herpes and there's not much benefit in non symptomatic people finding out they have herpes if the only way not to risk spreading it is to never have sex again. As for HPV AFAIK a test doesn't even exsist for asymptomatic  men, but even if it probably wouldn't be recommended by the CDC.

3063,"The net effect might ultimately be what you describe, but I'm pretty damn sure the RNC  doesn't want Trump out there saying insane shit or even just being involved in the first place. Almost every journalist is saying that their off the record talks with Republican officials have involved the Republicans being pissed off and frantic about Trump. Prebus personally told Trump to tone it down. Fox News also changed the rules of their debate presumably just to call Trump's  bluff and keep him off the debate stage. 

After Trump started gaining traction they announced that anyone participating in the Fox News debate had to file their full financial disclosure prior to the debate. Previously there was no requirement to do it before the ultimate FEC  deadline plus extention time. Mandating it before the first debate is unusual and there doesn't seem to be any motivation other than trying to keep Trump out.

The reason they would do that is because there was a whole lot of speculation that Trump would quit the race prior to having to actually disclose all his finances. Especially since it was widely speculated that Trump wildly inflated his actual net worth in speeches and interviews. Unfortunately for Fox News and the RNC Trump actually disclosed his finances  to the FEC and will have to be allowed in the debates.",2015-07-19 05:58:00+00:00,ct8euj9,2.0,t1_ct7um31,43667.0,nottheonion

3068,"The thing is the system is set up for pleas. Unless you're charged with something very serious they usually offer you a very reasonable plea deal early on (at least very reasonable compared to the statutory  maximum). People who just admit guilt usually get released pretty quickly on probation. 

The problem is people who actually are innocent  have to choose between accepting a criminal record and getting out on probation or fighting for their innocence  and spending forever waiting for a jury trial. For a lot of charges the time you'd spend waiting for a jury trial can far exceed what you'd actually be sentenced to if you took a plea.

I think the obvious fix for this is to set a time limit on how long someone can wait for trial without being released on an OR bond (if they had qualified for bail). That's where you're let out on bond without having to actually post any money. The only people who are going to sit in jail for months without posting a bond are going to be the people who truly have no means to post the money. If they can't post  it within a certain amount of time the state should have to release them on an OR bond if they haven't given them a trial yet.

Obviously this would only apply to cases where someone is ruled eligible for bail by a judge. Accused mass murderers wouldn't get let out because they wouldn't be eligible for a bond to begin with.",2015-07-18 05:36:12+00:00,ct7fydw,3.0,t1_ct70bl2,30829.0,news

Ass rape is  an entirely  different scenario. Especially when it supposedly  happened in conjuction with choking and hitting.

Anal sex is extremely painful if done forcefully especially without lots of lube. Her account is he pulled his condom off and then immediately physically attacked her and  raped her in the ass. That would be extremely brutal and painful. You have to be relaxed to have non painful anal sex. In her scenario she would be about as far from relaxed as possible when he's choking her and shoving his unlubed  dick in her ass.

3102,"There's not the same stigma surrounding people who have oral herpes, yet oral herpes has similiar effects and  can and does transmit to the genital region. A shocking percentage of people have genital herpes it's just most never know and it doesn't effect them. Routine STD tests don't even test for it. The CDC specifically advises against routine testing of herpes because there's no evidence it would do any good.

Routine screening of bacterial STDs  is important because they can be easily cured and thus quickly prevented from spreading to other people. Routine screening of HIV in high risk groups is important because the consequences of having HIV are still very serious (despite dramatically better outcomes these days). 

Also condom use almost eliminates the risk of spreading HIV. Condoms however don't offer much protection against Herpes since the virus spreads from skin to skin contact as opposed to just bodily fluids. A person who finds out they have HIV can just use condoms to prevent the spread. A person who has herpes would have to never have sex again to prevent the spread of herpes.

All of this is the reason the CDC doesn't even support screening for herpes. Herpes is just a necessary risk that you have to take if you're sexually active. The only possible way to have sex and not be at risk for herpes is if you're a virgin who marries a virgin and neither of you ever cheat. Other than that there's no way to protect yourself from herpes. Asking people to get a routine STD screen doesn't work, because they don't test for it. Always using condoms doest work because they don't prevent herpes spreading.  

The usually minor effects of living with herpes are a small price to pay for having an active sex life. The people who get frequent outbreaks make up a very small percentage of people who have herpes. A huge percentage of people with herpes never know they have it, while another big chunk of people only ever have very rare outbreaks.

As far as I know I don't have herpes so this isn't just me acting defensive. I'm also not a SJW whatsoever. I just happen to think the stigma surrounding herpes is way more than it deserves. Also to be clear I do agree that someone who knows they're infected should discuss that with their partners. I think that would be way more common if people didnt think herpes was the end of the world.

3103,"To be fair herpes has been used to try and fear monger kids out of having sex. I agree you absolutely should be honest with any partners, but we also need to reduce the stigma around herpes. A huge percentage of sexually active people have it. The vast majority never have symptoms that they notice and don't know they have it. Even if you've had routine STD tests you don't know whether you have  herpes. Herpes and HPV are not tested for in routine STD screens. Both are also spreadable regardless of whether you use a condom. Unless you're going to be a virgin  who marries a virgin, then HPV and Herpes are necessary risks if you want  to be sexually active.

With people who are very active in the swinger  community I'd wager almost all of them have had HPV or Herpes. Like I said condoms don't offer much protection against either, and routine  STD screens don't even test for them.

Here's the CDC talking about why they don't recommend routine STD tests include herpes.

Going through a little phase of excessive calorie restrictions doesn't mean you're anorexic anymore than getting drunk a few times makes you an alcoholic. There has to be a sustained pattern of behavior for it to be an issue. The fact that there are literally only 2 percent of people in America who are underweight is really a testament to how few chronic anorexics there are.

Keep in mind that the 2 percent underweight figure includes people who are underweight because of physical health problems like cancer patients going through chemo and elderly sick people. It also includes people who are underweight due to chronic abuse of stuff like meth, which absolutely destroys your appetite and practically makes it physically difficult to eat. Only a small percent of those underweight people are actual anorexics.

3172,"This is something that has been a pet peeve of mine for so long. It's always bugged me that so many people have this mentality that you're suppose to gorge yourself when you're pregnant. People think you're supposed to blow up and it's supposed to take you years to lose baby weight. Well yeah its going to take a long time to lose the weight IF you eat 3500 calories a day and gain 80 pounds during pregnancy.

My sister in law just gave birth a little while ago. She was already a pretty thin girl and ate a very healthy diet during pregnancy. There were people in my family freaking out about how she was too skinny and should be eating so much more during pregnany. Even saying she should be eating all sorts of junk food. People were genuinely freaking out about how the baby was going to be malnourished. 

Of course the doctor told her she was gaining exactly the appropriate rate of weight for pregnancy, and was actually enthusiastically praising her for not overeating like so many others.  People just wrongly have this idea that you're suppose to blow up during pregnancy. When she was 9 months pregnant she had a huge belly, but still otherwise looked like a thin healthy girl. 

Not only did the baby not come out malnourished she came out weighing over 9 and half pounds! People just delude themselves into thinking their pigging out is feeding the baby, when in reality all those exta calories are just turning into excess body fat on mom.

Eating more than a few hundred calories over maintenance  is not helping the baby. All its doing is indulging your personal desire to eat bad, and doing so puts your own health at risk. So many people gain absolutely insane amounts of weight during pregnancy and as at result have complications like high blood pressure and gestational diabetes.

My sister in law didn't struggle to lose baby weight, because she was smart enough not to put it on to begin with. Within a couple months she was basically back to her normal weight and she didn't have to starve herself or go to the gym hours a day to do that. Obviously the stretching of the skin on your stomach is not something that will go away quickly, but the pregnancy weight itself can go away if you actually eat like experts recommend when you're pregnant.

Now we know that not only is ""eating for two"" really unhealthy for mom it also may be unhealthy for the brain  development of the baby.  It's also going to be harder and more stressful taking care of a newborn if you're dealing with the 80 pounds of ""baby weight"" you put on by following the bullshit idea of eating for two.

3173,"Yeah Answer  2 makes a lot of sense. If you ever watch that show My 600 Pound Life you'll  see how insanely fast most people lose weight after gastric bypass. All gastric bypass really is is forced calorie restriction. If you eat more then a tiny bit at a time you get hella sick. So the people who actually follow the doctors plan after surgery lose the first couple hundred pounds  insanely fast. 

The only reason I can think for this is that they had become so fat that their maintenance  calories had become insanely high. High to the point where they would have lost weight even by eating an amount that would cause weight gain in  most thin people. When these people suddenly are forced to only eat 1000ish  calories a day the weight absolutely melts off despite them only doing very minimal physical exercise early on.

I think gastric bypass is really the perfect counter argument to people who deny calories mattering. If calorie defecits  don't matter then how the fuck do you explain the insane weight loss of people who are forced to restrict calories due to gastric bypass? People just ""dieting"" can bullshit themselves  and others and claim they're not losing weight despite strict calories restriction, but we have no way of knowing whether they're full of shit. Gastric bypass forces calorie restriction so these people can't lie. That's why they lose weight.

Edit

You need to state that you are a soon to be father and you intend to assert parental rights. You give the full name of the mother of the child and her contact information. Also put a rough estimation of the due date.  Obviously you also need to include your name, address, and phone number.

The problem is doing all of this doesn't actually grant you any rights to custody. All it does is require them to inform you the baby is being given up for adoption and a time period to fight for custody. Make records of any money or support you give to the pregnant mom. Insist on them taking it, and give checks as opposed to cash. Hold onto text messages so you can show an active interest in the child throughout the pregnancy like the guy in the article.

3216,"Yeah domestic violence rates are heavily centered around the poorest demographic. The common movie trope of some upper middle class suburban husband repeatedly beating the shit out of his all American wife is not at all what a typical DV  situation looks like. Rates of DV for married people are dramatically lower than for single people and dramatically lower still for financially stable married families.

Women and children are dramatically safer from abuse if they live with their husband/biological father of the children. The most common victims are relatively unstable poor women who bring abusive thug/hick boyfriends in the house who then hurt them and their children. The women themselves are often quite aggressive and the abuse is often mutual stemming from mutual abuse of drugs and alcohol. 

There are cases of some seemingly well off responsible husband who secretly  abuses a completely passive wife, but they're not at all the common scenario.  The common scenario is self destructive unstable people constantly fighting and screaming, and then one of them escalating the violence too far.

Edit:

I also think crazy aggresive unstable people are just drawn to each other. If you look at DV statistics a woman who's experienced  DV once is drastically more likely to be in future relationships  involving DV. I think it's because they're the type of people who like to be dramatic, fight, and argue and they are somehow drawn to other people with similiar characteristics. 

I've had 6 long term relationships in my life, and I've never even been in a real screaming fight in any of those or with my wife. Not a single time, and it's because none of us had that real dramatic and confrontational personality. I have a friend in a relationship where at least once a week they have a fight substantially worse than any fight I've ever been in in 15 years of dating.

 I believe that he and his girlfriend absolutely thrive on drama and tension. They've both gotten physically violent with each other numerous times. If they break up I'd imagine there's a really good chance their next relationships will be the same way. All it takes is putting two people like that togather.

You're acting like having sex is some sort of extremely serious special thing that has to be treated entirely different than every other thing in the world. Women don't lose value because they have sex with someone. I agree that there's a point where you can go from persuading to harassing, but the same point exists whether you're talking about sex or going to see Magic Mike. 

Obviously there's a point  where you go from friendly persuasion to demanding someone go see Magic Mike with you, but normal sane people understand that persuasion  and demanding are very different. If the song described some guy yelling at a girl demanding sex, then I'd agree with you. That's not at all what the song describes though.

3229,"The thing is Americans say the exact same things. It's pretty common for American kids to tell someone not to spaz  out. It's just instead of meaning don't act like a retard it just meant calm down. The implication is obviously that a spaz is someone who acts a little crazy or clumsy, but not someone who is actually mentally retarded or disabled. I just think the term spastic became much more specifically associated with cerebral palsy in the UK. 

You guys had a charity called something like the Spastic  Society specifically meant to help people with cerebral  palsy and that's probably the reason for all of this. All the old cerebral palsy  charities in the US don't seem to use spastic in the title in any way.

I'd also point out that spastic only really ""means"" cerebral palsy in the UK because that's how you guys used it. The term spastic orginally just meant muscle spasm, and that's still the common meaning in the US. Cerebral palsy isn't the only thing associated with spastic. There's also something called spastic colon or spastic colitis, which is Irritable Bowl Syndrome. There's also spastic bladder and spastic lower back pain.

3230,"Yeah the Wikipedia article on the word said people in the UK rate spastic as the second most offensive slur for disabled people. It's behind retard. In the US it's not even a remotely offensive word. Any intended reference to disabled people would be something really minor like someone having ADHD  not someone who's mentally retarded.

The Wikipedia article suggests the reason spastic became a slur in the UK had a lot to do with some sort of children's show in the early 80s having a character with cerebral  palsy. That apparently led to school kids calling people spastic in a manner like retard. British kids also called people ""Joeys"" with the intention of calling them retarded since the disabled character's name was Joey.

So basically some sort of public service lesson on disabilities inadvertently  led to spastic being used like retard. Personally I find this fascinating because I had no clue it was considered offensive in the UK. Do British people watching American shows think we are all assholes making fun of retarded people? I read that several American toy products had to be recalled from the UK over use of the word spastic.

If you told me yesterday that spastic is a major slur in the UK, then I would have looked at you like you're a tard.

This woman clearly did not get this body from eating 100 calories a day and chain smoking cigarettes between lines of coke. This woman got this body from a long term commitment to moderate excercise and a healthy diet.

There are some people who over exercise to the point of being an unhealthy obsession, but this woman is clearly not an example of this. She's not some sort of female bodybuilder shooting steroids and lifting weights 6 hours a day. Nor does she look like she does 6 hours of cardio  a day and is wasting away from excessively  low body fat. She doesn't even have really defined abs. This is the body of someone who works out moderately and eats healthy. That's it.

Our society has become so unhealthy that working out for 45 minutes a day 5 days a week is considered unreasonable. This body does not require starving yourself and exercising 7 hours a day. It just requires moderate exercise and a healthy lowish calorie day OVER a long period of time. The reason there are so many grossly overweight people is because 95 percent of people don't commit to a lifestyle change for long enough to see dramatic progress.

You sure the cops you see in court aren't mostly special duty officers who work just in jails and courts?  Even then most of the correction officers I've encountered were in relatively decent shape, and I've encountered many dozens in several different counties.

Maybe the Atlanta region is stricter on officer fitness, but I can honestly say I extremely rarely see a fat cop here. I never remember seeing an actual obese cop (like the video) beyond maybe a couple of the ladies working the computers at intake in the  jail.

Maybe fitness requirements  are just highly dependent  on the city or county? Now that I think of it a lot of the obese cops I've seen on TV have been in the northeast. Maybe because union job protections there are much stronger? Down here ""it's right to work"" so there's not much to hide behind.

3295,"No doubt there are some prisons that are more secure than any jail. The super max prisons have no equivalent in terms of county jails. However, there are plenty of minimum  and medium security prisons that are easier to escape from than some large county jails. Large county jails often house everyone from pot heads to mass murderers. In doing so the security tends to default towards the highest level offender they have.

Minimum security prisons don't house a kid who had a gram of pot, but they also don't house anyone looking at more than a few years. There are plenty of prisons where all the inmates are relatively close to getting out, and as such are trusted with a fair amount of freedom. When you watch TV shows about prisons they usually just show you maximum security prisons.

All I'm saying is that your average large county jail is much closer to maximum security than a minimum or even medium security prison.",2015-06-30 16:56:33+00:00,csnpcs8,4.0,t1_csnlimn,5847.0,videos

Just a little while ago in my town an unarmed white kid got gunned down by cops serving a search warrant for petty ass marijuana. ,2015-06-27 01:42:33+00:00,csk3g55,6.0,t1_csk2cze,2144.0,news
3351,I found it kind of interesting that the AME church that the Charleston shooting happened at is actually strongly against gay marriage. The president celebrated the legalization of same sex marriage right before going to speak at the funeral of pastor who was against gay marriage. Just crazy the odds that these two events would happen on the same day.,2015-06-27 01:24:13+00:00,csk2vxk,2.0,t1_csjtixd,17118.0,news
3352,"Problem is proving that she knew he wasn't the father. If he believed it enough to give her money, then he surely must have had sex with her around the time she got pregnant. Unless they can prove she knew he wasn't the father then I'm not sure how strong of a case they have. In cases where there's clear evidence of purposeful deception I agree fraud charges are appropriate.",2015-06-26 23:00:31+00:00,csjyejx,4.0,t1_csjpedq,14925.0,MensRights
3353,"Yeah OP needs to read to the end of article where they point out a similiar case of a rich boy driving drunk and killing someone. He's apparently got off scot  free, and people in Thailand are enraged by the way rich people get off in Thailand. 

There's plenty of research in America showing discrimination against men in the criminal justice system, but this single case of a rich girl in Thailand is pretty meaningless",2015-06-26 22:43:40+00:00,csjxv5q,2.0,t1_csj8r8s,47136.0,MensRights
3354,"Which study are you talking about? The little interactive chart thing that searches through rate my professor posts for keywords and separates them by gender? I haven't looked at it all obviously, but from playing around with it you can see its a very mixed bag. Women are more likely to be called bossy, yet men are dramatically more likely to be called jerks, dicks, and assholes.


As far as looks related comments it seems like it's largely dependent on the gender makeup of the subject area. Female dominated majors like Fine Arts and Humanities end up with mostly men being described as either hot or ugly. Male dominated majors like engineering end up with mostly women being described as hot or ugly. I think the reason for that is pretty self evident.

The news reports on that rate my professor interactive chart all focus on negative words that female teachers are more likely to be called, but playing with it for 2 minutes will show you there are plenty of negative words that are used disproportionately  against male professors.

The NY Times article on it references solely positive words that male teachers are more likely to be described as, and solely negative words that female teachers  are more likely to be described as (with the possible exception of beautiful). It's absurd. They could have take a more nuanced and honest look at it, but chose to sensationalize  it instead.

Edit 

Somehow I missed this the first time I read it, but checkout that NY times article about the gendered use of words on rate my professor. They actually quote the author of that study (of sorts) as specifically saying he was surprised by how few students actually commented on female teachers dress or appearance.
