66,"There are couple of points I would like to make. Issues and proposals for solving them:

1. There is no unified official body/organization that will be responsible for marketing and PR of FOSS in general. Regardless of FSF efforts, a unified center that will help FOSS projects to create modern looking webpages, work with mass media, come up with campaigns and deal with public relations, develop marketing strategies and l product development. Leave the code for the developers and business for businessmen. Distribute the workforce by knowledge and skills. You can't expect developers to be good at sales and marketing.

2. After more then 30 years there is still no viable proven business model that will bring steady financial support for FOSS projects(rather then donations). Here we could take example from RedHat. Create a product, give it away. Provide a 24/7 fanatical super personal support for a monthly fee. Right now, once you switch to FOSS your on your own. You are lucky to find help in forums, reddit or irc. But other then that, you're doomed. FOSS developers and their fans have to ""grow up"" and take responsibility for their product. If they want to make a substantial income, it is possible via technical support subscriptions. We are in 2016 now. There a gazillions of ways to be in touch with your user, messengers, calls, text, video calls. Whatever. Call them by name, congratulate them with their birthday. Create a family.

4. Most of the FOSS is made just for the sake of doing it, and depends on the whims of its leader/founder. There is no market/customer development teams, no product development teams. One word, it seems just amateurish. In this case, FOSS project leaders should change their mentality, and treat their ""baby"" with responsibility. Its a commitment. Quick example, Crunchbang. Beautiful and reliable distro. One guy left the project. Result? Crunchbang ++, Bunsenlabs, and others. Instead of consolidating efforts they are split. No need for another distro just because you changed the icon theme. The projects/products shouldn't be dependent on one person decision.

4. Despite of existence of so much literature on market development and bringing new products to mainstream markets, everybody ignores it. And we are not talking just about pretty websites here. Just read Crossing The Chasm or Inside The Tornado by Moore. As I understand,  we are in an early market, the segment of technological enthusiasts. We didn't even crossed the chasm of Visionaries. And we doing it all to ourself. Nobody to blame. 

5. The mentality of FOSS community that money is evil. Well ,if its so, why then most of them are asking(read begging) for money for support? As like sayng, hey we created this shiny new thing. Can you help us? In our capitalist global economy it is really hard to make it work, unless you make a really distinct product that changes ""the game"". Which means, most of the FOSS alternatives are just substitutes of already functioning systems. Unless you are a geek, innovator, visionary you won't change your habits for mere sake of change. FOSS really has to bring something unique and new to the table. 

7. Desktop market shrinks. Due to my job, I have a chance to ask random people of different layers of society about their personal computers. Here are couple of interesting insights. A good part of them use their computers(laptops) once a week if ever. All of their tasks are done using a smart phone. Their are mostly consumers of the information. They don't care about their online privacy, ignorant about FOSS. They don't bother. So if a person doesn't know its sick, you can't sell him medicine. The other part use their computers more often, because of their jobs or school. They produce information. Most of the complains will be regarding speed. But over all their are satisfied, since they don't know how do alternatives work. They don't know of the existence of alternative at all. Besides lots of them use proprietary software. 

In my opinion, when it comes to desktops, FOSS its in a dead end. It has if not to revolutionize itself at least evolve. Adopt to new realities of the market.  Has to decide who is their market. Whom they are targeting? I will believe these will be people who produce information since desktops are easier for that kind of tasks. We can see right now, IT developers prefer FOSS. But other then that there is a lack of professional high quality software that will make people switch from Adobe, Autodesk etc. 

And last thing, there is also a problem with a channel distribution. Other then internet, there is nothing else. As alternative, direct sales, network marketing or even MLM are all viable solutions. ",2016-01-11 19:00:38+00:00,cyubqod,1.0,t3_407hgu,173541.0,linux
