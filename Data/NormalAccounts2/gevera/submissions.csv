I would like to know the community position on elementary OS Professional Technical Support via Membership Subscription (RedHat Model). 
I know that Dan, Cody and other guys of the project are in need for financial support and extra streams of income. 
I also know that there are users of elementary OS that are in need sometimes for PROFESSIONAL technical support, and some of them might even agree to pay for it.
So in this case I see a win-win situation where both parties benefit from it.
Since technical support might steal time from the development, that might affect the speed of the elementary releases. At the same time though, if enough cashflow is created, part time technical support assistants/contractors could be hired specifically for this task. 
In a nutshell, elementary project receives financial support in exchange for technical support from its members. Users go on official website, register on members page, share their contact information and pay a monthly or early fee. In case those members have any difficulties, elementary technical support team will help via phone, email or remote control assistance. Thus, members will have less headaches with their issues. If everything works as it should, elementary team will generate cashflow that could be invested in continuous refining of their OS and grow as an IT startup. On the users side, the members can directly support the project they love and be pleased with the quality of the service. In case things don't go as expected, elementary team just loses time and effort in implementing the changes on their website.",elementaryos,Community feedback - elementary OS alternative source of income - Membership subscription,https://www.reddit.com/r/elementaryos/comments/56olrx/community_feedback_elementary_os_alternative/

I ran pacman -Syu and it promted of 900mb downloat, net of 3500gb of installs. I accepted all the changes, pacman started to dowload all available updates. Now i noticed a gnome shell notification about low disk space, only 137mb left. After some time, my virtualbox session crashes. I reboot it, and now pacman doesnt wark, plus im low on disk space.
