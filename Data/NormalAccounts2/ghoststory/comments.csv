 I'm not a qpoc but i hear them and believe them when they say that Yes, it fucking does.

You're clinging really firmly to a kind of #NotAllCops argument, the kind of argument that is regularly decried in this very sub. And anyways, I've already addressed the fact that folks who work as cops are not being demanded to leave, their floats are, and beyond that they are still welcome to show up out of uniform. So you're really fighting for their right to have their float included in the parade, which I've addressed above.

&gt;Guess what? No matter what, cops will be there.

You know what? until recently I would have agreed.

Being a person of color doesn't come with any of those privileges . They are born into a world that systematically disenfranchises them because of skin color, and they have little chance of divorcing themselves from that reality.

The equivalencies you've set up are false, because queer cops have privileges they can divest themselves of without sacrificing anything, besides the power that comes with cop-dom. To equate that sacrifice with qpoc sacrificing safety is simply wrong.

&gt;From the countless times that Iâ€™ve been rejected for a white girl, Iâ€™ve been taught that my desirability was only a fleeting moment whereas a white girl was the one worth getting to know, the one worth bringing home to parents and the one worth being treated as a human. I was the sexual object, whereas my housemate was the one who had feelings worth considering.

I recall the number of times that my non-white girlfriends and I have praised a white guy (...) for seeing us as a real people instead of objects.

It's true that jews and arabs lived together in palestine long before 1948. in 1918, there were 700,000 arabs and 56,000 jews in palestine.

263,"I never claimed that racism is only perpetuated by white people. I have been focussing on white people (and anti-black racism) because of your comparison of /r/blackladies to stormfront.

I also never claimed that racism can ""only be institutional"". I brought up institutional racism because it's important to recognize that racism goes beyond the public online spaces we're discussing.

Like I've said, I believe that racism is rooted in power and historical context. As such, I believe that many marginalized groups (indigenous, black, asian, middle-eastern) can experience racism, and within many different spheres, not just institutional. it could be in every day interactions, online, or within intimate relationships/friendships. 

It's also important to acknowledge that white people are not the only people who perpetuate racism, but these instances are still informed by the power dynamics between groups. These are all important discussions that are already happening if you're interested.

But my feeling is that your main point of interest is whether or not non-white people (say, users on r/blackladies) can be ""racist"" towards whites, specifically.

Again, I'm not here to change your beliefs, but to challenge them. My belief is that it's unproductive to talk about ""racism against whites"", because white people as a group have been the ones that have historically spread the most racism, and continue benefit the most from those racist practices. 

 I've explained this many times. You're clearly not interested in discussing that, just as a creationist might not be interested in discussing the fossil record.

As such, I hesitate to post academic articles, because if you actually cared, you'd do some research yourself. simply googling ""racism and power"" will bring up a host of articles that you can look at, if you feel so inclined.",2016-06-30 16:51:34+00:00,d4u616p,33.0,t1_d4u3pva,2930.0,Drama

1) yes!

2) no, they aren't.

I can see that it's very important for you to be able to equate these two groups, to paint them both as ""racist"", therefore allowing you dismiss them both. I have my guesses towards your motivation for this: dismissing stormfront as ""bigots"" allows you to dismiss the real-life violence that stormfront and other racist online spaces perpetuate against people of color. By the same token, you can dismiss the lived experience of r/blackladies as ""racist"", absolving you from considering what it is that black women find so frustrating about white people. 

This requires a simplistic definition of racism (something like ""one racial group expressing dislike for another"") that I, and many others, consider to be insubstantial, precisely because it's main function is to dismiss the power dynamics that exist between said groups. 

clinging to this ""definition"" tells me a lot about you. it tells me that you're not interested in discussing said power dynamics, and that you'd prefer not to think about their historical precedent, and present-day consequences. I'm not expecting to change your belief. but I won't walk away without challenging you to face those feelings.

313,"&gt;So this is the fault of the US?

i brought up US imperialism killing middle eastern people because you insinuated that i was fine with watching queer people die. I dont really know how you feel about the US killing hundreds of thousands of people in the middle east though. 

&gt;And a great many more who are not ok with homosexuals.

assuming this is true, it still doesnt invalidate the experiences of queer muslim folks, and muslim folks who support queer people.

Again, this is a cultural issue, and certainly not one that is confined to Muslim communities. queerphobia is a cultural artifact that we can only fight with education and compassion.

My belief is that it's inappropriate for people who do not have to deal with racism (read: white men living in Ottawa) to weigh in so heavily on issues regarding racial discrimination. If anyone was actually interested in having a discussion, I would expect more consideration for the POV of the folks raising concerns about this band's name and what it means to give them a space to perform. 

I see no such discussion here. The bulk of what I see is people saying that if they don't see a problem, there's no problem. and if they feel good about the venue, no one should dare call their practices into question.
