Since then i haven't stopped going on reddit so i thought I'd give nofap another try.
I've fallen out of a relationship that I may not be able to salvage, certainly not if I keep maintaining my relationship to porn
It's always nice sharing with other people and I hope nofap, and my fellow fapstronauts, help keep me accountable.

Much love to you all, and here's to caring for ourselves, too.
