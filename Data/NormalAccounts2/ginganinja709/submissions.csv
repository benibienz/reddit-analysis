I saw it a few months back and I can't find it anywhere now. They're standing on stage together, and I need it to win an argument.",trump,Mitt Romney Tax Returns,https://www.reddit.com/r/trump/comments/4iybct/mitt_romney_tax_returns/

Historically the black community has held manufacturing or construction jobs in the us, just think of detroit and the big 3 auto manufacturing companies and a high black population. These jobs are now either being exported to china, or taken by illegal immigrants. Now when there is a high unemployment rate in a community crime rates go up as people struggle to make a living. This is exactly what is happening to the black community today, they have a higher crime rate in part because they're out of a job and desperate to make money. This leads to a negative image of african americans and heightened racial tension. 
So how do we get the manufacturing jobs back? 
1. Stop illegal immigration
2. Stop china's currency manipulation
3. Stop unions from bankrupting companies
All things trump has talked about, just not put into a racial context. This is why trump has 25% of the black vote, because he's actually trying to solve problems and not just pat black people on the back and say that he's sorry",trump,Trump to end racial tensions,https://www.reddit.com/r/trump/comments/46dibi/trump_to_end_racial_tensions/
