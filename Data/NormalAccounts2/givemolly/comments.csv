1,"All the tracking maps were disabled. Everyone thought the 3 step problem would be temporary too. At this point I doubt tracking in any way will be fixed. If it is sometime in the future, based on how long it's been since the problem began, I'd wager the fix would come too late. I've also deleted the app",2016-07-31 13:26:46+00:00,d5ya1u5,2,t1_d5ya05p,113,pokemongo
2,"So now one is allowed to be upset about a ""bug"" that has existed for over a week, that takes away from the entire point of the game, because you, singular, are not able to play? I think the complaints are completely valid. The game isn't out everywhere, a lot of people can't play, but that doesn't mean that everyone in the world who can should stay silent about every problem.",2016-07-24 07:19:12+00:00,d5oixv5,1,t3_4uc6s3,401,pokemongo

5,"I have the same problem. I have a loop I usually walk in my neighborhood that's 5km and it was tracked fine when the game came out. Now I'm lucky if it registers 2 of those 5 km. I've seen lots of posts about it so I think it's a common problem, probably a problem with the server being overloaded so it doesn't refresh your location as much",2016-07-18 17:56:04+00:00,d5h29j8,1,t3_4tg4ne,3988,pokemongo
