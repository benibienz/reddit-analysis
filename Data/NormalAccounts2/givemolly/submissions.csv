I have a hypothesis that, if correct, can prevent losing pokemon in that way. 

Last night I was catching a pidgey and after the 8th failed attempt I gave up and ran. When you run from a pokemon, it returns to where you found it and you have the opportunity to catch it again. What I noticed was the button to run away from the pokemon appears the instant the pokeball opens up. This means you can run before the pokemon even hits the ground. 

My hypothesis is that if you run from the pokemon the instant it breaks free, the pokemon won't have time to start the animation to flee, and therefore you can keep a cycle of throwing pokeballs and running away the moment the pokemon breaks free in order to prevent it from fleeing after too many attempts. 

I did some testing with a few different encounters. 
1. Encounter a pokemon
2. Attempt to catch pokemon
3. The instant it breaks free, run as soon as the option pops up.
4. Repeat

None of the pokemon I tried this on ended up running and I caught all of them. If this really works then it'll be a nice way to make sure you don't lose any rare pokemon you come across. Still needs way more testing though, I could have just been lucky.

TL;DR: run away the instant the pokemon breaks free, reencounter, repeat, might be a way to stop pokemon from running",pokemongo,A hypothesis to combat running pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/4tnfep/a_hypothesis_to_combat_running_pokemon/

It's usually not every lucio in a game though. Most of the time it's just our lucio, but sometimes it's the enemy lucio. Either way, really annoying to play against all you can see is his gun and his skates gliding around.

The second I've found more recently with D. Va. When your meka dies you get that warning sign before you jump out, but since yesterday, nearly every time I eject, the warning sign comes on as normal but about 2 seconds later when I'm running around meka-less, it comes on again and turns my whole screen black except for the red warning sign flashing. 

Not sure why or how these bugs happen or how to replicate them. Anyone else experienced these? Any solutions?",Overwatch,A couple of bugs with lucio and d. Va,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/4s304f/a_couple_of_bugs_with_lucio_and_d_va/

Probably a lot of people, just because this is the highest level of play doesn't mean everyone has to be a meta slave.

1st Why is violent revenge his preferred set? The way I see it is chilling is primarily a db10 mon due to his ability to steal the immunity buff. If there is only one buff to steal wouldn't a swift set make more sense for faster turns to be and to steal the buff faster? My chilling is vio rev but I can't do db10 yet so I can't try it out myself but when I've used him in similar scenarios he gets violent procs but since he doesn't really do damage and he almost always steals buffs first try they seem useless. 

2nd question is are skill ups actually good on him? Looking at what gets increased when you skill him up, his first skill gets damage increase which is pretty useless since he's not meant to do damage unless you really want him to and effect accuracy but he has 3 chances to steal buffs and for dragons at least you get it first attack. The effect accuracy could be good with his attack speed slow but thats about it. His second ability decreases cooldown with skill ups but the problem I see with lower cooldown on this skill is that his ai would be using it instead of his first skill when the dragon gets the immunity buff and you would have to either pray for a violent proc (this is the one case I can see violent &gt; swift) or wait until your next turn.",summonerswar,Some questions about Chilling,https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerswar/comments/421po2/some_questions_about_chilling/
