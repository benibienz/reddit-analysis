Carried to Silver last season through duos and to gold the season before that. It hasn't been until this season that I've realized how hard I was really carried by my diamond friends. That in combination with over a year spent away from the game since the last time I was what I would call decent. I was bouncing around in S3-S4 before I rollover hoping to get my mmr, mostly solo queue but some duo, went 4-6 in placements and went straight to B4 because I'm pretty sure my MMR was a fair bit lower than the avg. S3 from over duoing to get to silver towards the start of the season and losing a lot of matches at 0 LP. I've had some time off and as I'm starting an internship full time in a little over a month, I don't have any classes this qtr., and seeing as it's the start of the season, most of my RL friends are playing whenever they can too, so I've been playing a lot league more than I ever have. I'm talking almost 200 games played. I had this idea that I needed to climb my way out of of Bronze ASAP while those that didn't belong here were still around high bronze and it wouldn't be complete ELO hell quite yet. As I played so much solo queue without my high plat/diamond friends on their smurfs, I realized how bad my fundamentals were for someone who previously considered themselves to be high silver or even gold skill level. I compared myself with other previous golds that climbed there themselves and didn't nearly have their ability to consistently carry bronze matches. My CS at times was where I thought it should be but not consistently, at times not above 150 at 25 minutes, which I figure basically leaves me useless as a carry at that point in the game. Most of these realizations came around 60~ games for me. I really anticipated climbing out into silver in less than 100, perhaps even less than 50 games. Almost 200 games later and I'm b5 0 lp, lower than I started. (After a fkn tilter of a night mind you), and I just don't know what to do. I honestly feel that I'm able to be self critical and see my mistakes much more than the average bronze and my friends that sit in skype with can attest to this. I also come down on myself for lack of cs and I've definitely seen it improve in the last 100 games along with my map awareness and death count avg.. I could state the obvious about AFK's and whatnot, and in my case I without fail seem to get my unlucky AFK games the match before series or in my series itself, but this obviously cannot be completely blamed for my rank. Around the 100 game mark I also went through and checked my brand games, who I played for a majority of those games, and saw that my win % with him was really low, especially considering I felt that was my most impactful champion/lane pick. So I decided to stop with the support for a while, even the games I did well and had that crazy brand support damage, it still didn't feel like I could carry myself out of bronze with it even if it my most comfortable pick. Decided to focus on improving ADC and top game, because it seems like the easiest to carry from, and they're my weakest positions. What are some other steps I could take to make myself silver worthy? Really any tips are appreciated, along with any tales of the climb anyone might have from their own experience. Would you advise trying to push with a small set of champions or really focusing just 1 or 2 and trying to master them as well as I can? Is a 45% win rate in b5- b3 a sign that a climb is really not a realistic goal for me? Sorry this post is all over the place, but my mind is feeling a bit that way after this tilt party and I'm just feeling lost. As someone who considers himself a decent gamer, with a pretty healthy record PVE record in all kinds of MMO's, namely a world top 5 HLK25H kill and a world top 10 KJ kill, I really don't feel like I have the reflexes or awareness of someone that should be bronze, even though with a couple really old glad titles, I'm historically not a PVPer. With a past full of so much serious gaming and relative success with hard objectives, it's killing me that I'm ending up so unsuccessful this series after putting so much of myself and my time into it. Halp pals D:&gt; .

TLDR -~- My KDA for the last 100~ is 6.5.:3:7, avg CS at 15 minutes is 104,  is this even close to where I need to be to contend at low Silver? Do I deserve a 45% win rate with a scoreline like that? What things do I need to focus on to really climb and improve my win %? How did you climb out of bronze by yourself? What are champions to learn that are perfect for the job?
