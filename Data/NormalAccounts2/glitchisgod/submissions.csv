I recently got back into edm mainly deep house &amp; garage I suppose. I really have liked Gorgon city, Clean Bandit, Grades, Disclosure, Duke Dumont, Zhu, Shift K3y, Rudimental, MNEK &amp; Route 94. I like good singers over good beats. What else do you think i'd like? I have trouble keeping up with new songs because i've been into hip hop for a few years. I know most of the artist I listed are pretty mainstream, I'm not necessarily looking for mainstream. I do like songs with videos but I can do it without them too.
