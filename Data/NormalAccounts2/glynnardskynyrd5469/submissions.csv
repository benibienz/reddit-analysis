Ever since, my life has went into a downward spiral. This is all because of what has happened after her. I literally can't seem to get a girl. I have been in three extremely short relationships since (all three left me because of my intense insecurities). I also haven't had sex in a long time. Ironically, my celibacy streak has actually ruined a couple opportunities. Sex has become kinda weird to me. I am bitter towards those who have it. I did have a very active social life, but I got to the point where I was so sick of women liking my friends instead of me, that I literally quit going out. Listen, I'm in no position to blow my own horn, but I'm a pretty cool guy. I have a good job, my own house, my sense of humor is a big part of my life, so I start to wonder: why me? I'm obviously still sore from my engagement (I won't go into it, but I actually broke off the engagement). I just feel like I'm walking in quicksand. I am constantly thinking about the rejection of the last few years and have begun to truly wonder what the hell is wrong with me. I have resorted to shrinks, anti-depressant medication. It shouldn't affect me like it does. Everyone wonders what happened to the old me. I'd love to meet women, and start off fresh. But, those insecurities rear their ugly head pretty soon after a girl shows interest. If it wasn't for the immense heartbreak I have gone through, there is no doubt I would have been more successful. So, what gives? This is sort of a last resort. I can't do this much longer. It hurts too bad.
