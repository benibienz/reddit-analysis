Most have been saying how wonderful and fun the game is (not that I would know) but it seems like everyone is too into pokemon to be able to say otherwise. I love pokemon as well, but the last 4 generations have just been boring and too easy. My problem is everyone said XY was different and better and, to me, it was just as mundane as the previous entries. Not trying to bash, but Im just trying to get a level perspective on this game before I buy it. Youve seem to carry the same idea.

64,"A lot to say. Kuma is only 6 months, so I'm learning here and I'm sure all his behavior will not be his final temperament. 

He has a problems getting along with other dogs, but only because he is 3x more energetic than they are. Other dogs end up being fed up with him because of annoyance. He is very friendly with people and loves to say hello. But he adores me and my girlfriend. 

We were on a 4 day vacation and after coming back he started to sleep by us and stick close by. They say Shibas are super loyal to their family and it is true. Even at the park he won't run too far away. 

Energy wise. It's on and off. For 12 hours straight he will lay around and sleep (I assume it's because he is growing) then the other half of the day he is wired. It can be exhausting. 

Otherwise trading him is dead easy. And he is smart enough to instinctively know many basic habits. Like walk with me and potty training. 

Lastly is doesn't help that he is one of the most gorgeous dogs I've ever seen. I look at him every and enjoy how cute or handsome he is.

102,"Glad your hitting up the water park. Something about Florida and its water parks are equal to none. I would suggest moving that second day from the Magic Kingdom to something else. Magic kingdom is great but very, very similar to Disneyland. Hit up the new experiences and skip places like Peter Pan/Buzz Lightyear/Splash Mountain/etc. Since they vary slightly you should fill that one day with everything new in MK (Beauty and the Beast, Carousel of Progress, Liberty Square) and call it. Use that extra day to go for Epcot a third day or even Studios a second. This is a power opinion, but coming from WDW to DL I found WDW and Disneyland were way too similar! You would need 2 days to complete MK, but if you are truly strapped for time you may find yourself disappointed that about the MK is just like DL. (Thought I must note that even the same attractions are different in interesting or worthwhile ways like Haunted Mansion, Splash Mountain, Thunder Railroad) 

It may sound silly, however I think a very underrated part of WDW is its resorts. I enjoy the themes and atmosphere that make the park so great and you can find a lot of that ingenuity in its resorts. Most of WDW's hotels are themed to the level of Grand California Hotel or even more. It may be fun to take the extra day from MK and use it towards the Water Park and visiting the different hotels. Check the shops, enjoy the scenery, walk around. I enjoy taking my time around the parks to find the little things and quirks placed around the parks and going to a resort with many many hotels with that same craft is fun to me. Only do this if you dont have kids :p But do try and check out the other hotels if you have any time at all.

Just hold that second day to MK till the end, if you find you need extra time to see another park then use that day. Next time schedule ~~9~~ 20 days... WDW is intense lol ENJOY!",2016-09-28 07:59:17+00:00,d858nsj,3.0,t1_d857nxi,3326.0,Disneyland

147,If you are strapped for money and really MUST go that cheap and are sure you dont need the space then go for it. But I would Highly recommend not doing so. Maybe even the 5s in 32gb. That must be dirt cheap right now. I would recommend a 6SE at 32gb or at the very least a 6se 16gb.

148,"Some say physical force is bad or makes them distrust you, but I feel there is some give in that. But I would probably spank my kid if I had one. I just use enough physicality to show Kuma he can't get away with being a dick. Nipping is fine. I know he is only 4 months, but biting I won't tolerate. I mostly use timeout and you redirecting. I ALWAYS have a toy to shove in his mouth when he gets to be too much. As far as being physical goes I do enough to pester him and show him it goes both ways. I grab the loose skin on his neck (gently) and hold it, I hold his mouth closed and have him look at me and say no, roughhouse with him and pin him down. 

Just to be clear I do these all in mostly playful ways.  I try to be fun and rough, kind of show him I'm not a pushover. But we have a good time. He loves it. Except holding his mouth shut. 

Lastly a great trick I found is to put my index finger into the very back of his teeth, where there are just gums. He thinks he is chewing but it doesn't hurt at all. Saved me when I'm trying to watch a show and he nips at me. 

Hope this helps, Kuma is 4 months right now so I'm experiencing everything just a month before you. ",2016-08-16 00:49:54+00:00,d6j2udy,1.0,t3_4xr2fb,86204.0,shiba

This test was not exact, but good enough. Even then most all the recent phones and firmwares looked to run quite fast and smoothly. Running iOS on a phone might have been hard 9 years ago, however we have perfectly capable machines in our pockets now. Updating your phone was important with iPhone 1,3, and 4, but as the 6S and 7 come out, updating is not necessary. The hardware has matched the needs of the software and will only surpass it from here. Smartphones only NEED to be so powerful. We will never need to run Halo and Lightroom on these devices. The only reason I will be updating from the 6-7 is because my battery does not last as long as it used to.

Pop quotes... 10 years from now no one will care about Hunger Games let alone the sad way it fizzled out of existence in the last film. 

The point is people get tattoos of ridiculous things on themselves. I fucking love Harry Potter, I read it every year. I love Final Fantasy, I have played nearly every game. However, there is no reason to get a huge sleeve of Alan Rickman saying ""Always,"" or a moogle on your arm.

*Roommate now - Has a dog she never takes out so it resorts to urinating and shitting all over the kitchen floor, which she proceeds to clean up every now and then WITHOUT mopping. Why? Because dog pee is sterile. She lets the dog eat out of the peanut butter jar and never clean up its hair. She once found a cat and never changed its litter box so eventually the whole house smelled like a burning asshole for a few months. After the cat was gone she thought maybe she could use the old litter box as a drawer for clothes. WTF!?

*College Roommate - He was so lazy he never left the room and played video games and watched OTHER people play video games on youtube all day. He was so lazy he once got up at night and peed in the sink in our room instead of walking down the hall to the public bathroom (dorm). He was a pain but not the worst.

*My first roommate - Sold drugs from our dorm room and brought a lot of shady people to hang out. This resulted in someone stealing my credit card information and charging $11,000 to it in stolen iPads. I also once woke up to him banging some girl and for the next 10 minutes the sound of his ballslapping grew louder and more frequent.

I was never able to take my computer to class because the battery only lasted a couple hours and I looked crazy trying to lug that and books everywhere. Just remember this. 

I cannot speak fully to the XPS15 but after my AW, this thing feels like a godsend. It is incredibly light, sophisticated and sexy. The AW has too much aesthetic to it, after a while I wished it was simpler and lighter. The XPS is very light and feels much much more durable than the AW. I can also take it to the bathroom.

359,"Dear PaxterBaxter,

I have not played your game. And honestly, for .99 I wont. Ever. There are a few things that turn me off of a game and one of em is not being able to play it. You are asking me to spend a whole dollar of my money to take another chance at another puzzle game that might let me down like all the others. I NEED a lite version. I need to play 5 levels.every puzzle game I love has been free in the beginning. Do that. Make the first section free and make us pay .99 for the rest. Then it seems like a deal. ""Oh this is good, only a buck for the rest of these levels? fantastic!""

Second (again I havent played it) please do not use time or star based systems. In a world of multitasking and no time to do it in, I want a puzzle game I can play while I watch my favorite tv show or listening to a podcast or while watching Youtube. The last thing I want is to be constantly timed in my effort or graded on my performance. I want solid puzzles that take a string of logic to fix. Do not bar your game behind a system only multimilliondollar companies can succeed with. Give me a solid level and as a human with a brain I will want to figure it out. I will figure it out and let me progress to the next level. Hiding your levels behind time scors, energy, or stars will only discourage me from playing anymore of your game. This has turned me off of many incredible games. I want to finish them but sudoku turns out to be the best option in the end. No one is twisting my arm in the end.

Finally the art style. I get it. A mouse and cheese and a puzzle. Classic. But it looks cheesy (mind the pun) If you cannot create a cohesive character then go simple. Simple lines and shapes, in the end I will only notice shapes as I try to sole the puzzle. Make objects obvious, Make the controls intuitive. The less I have to think about what things are and how they work the quicker I can play. The sooner I can easily show my friends how to play. 

I could test your game for you if you are interested in more commentary but it seems you already have quite the number of responses. Let me know. 

(Finally if you want people to know about your game, then MARKET MARKET MARKET. Post it EVERYWHERE. Out of sight out of mind. If I see it everywhere then I am likely to give it a shot.)

Goodluck,
GF",2016-01-04 09:14:16+00:00,cyld8wo,1.0,t3_3zacmv,60064.0,iphone
360,"Wow! I came back to some fantastic results. and way above what I was thinking of. I say 2-300$ because I know there must be some way to buy old model processors for cheaper. Those results are pretty nice though. On top of that I need a monitor but im sure I can find a cheap enough one. My last question is, are there hdmi and sound ports on the mother boards? or will I need some kind of USB converter device?",2016-01-02 20:35:14+00:00,cyjm231,1.0,t3_3z6fyo,2543.0,pcmasterrace

364,"I'll start by saying, while gorgeous, the 4K screen is frivolous. So nix that. I have the FHD and it is still outstanding to look at. 

Go Core i5. It's not the fanciest but it has some decent power and it's a quadcore with turbo boost. 
This version also contain a 1tb hdd with 8gb memory and a rock solid Nvidia GTX 960m. 

I was in the market for a beautiful and powerful laptop but for the cheaper side. If you shop in the ""For Work"" section you will find this skew for $1,299. I believe this is only a step up from the base model of $999. Save a the $400 and buy this model.  I have been testing it for the last couple weeks and it is just what I needed. 

I think SSD and 4K are overrated when it comes to budget. These are not ""must haves"" so please skip them.

365,Right click Desktop &gt; Open Nvidia Setting &gt; click Manage 3D Settings. Here you can personally find the program/game and see if Nvidia has assigned it discrete or integrated graphics. You can forcefully assign it on or the other. Hit apply. You can sleep soundly. And plug in that computer!
