While I am rather pleased with the upgrade, however I cannot help but shake some thoughts that follow after using this 7 for the past 2 weeks.
-
The iPhone 6 is sleek and fast. It always took fantastic photos on the go, quickly accessed any webpage via LTE, play any game, and could handle pretty much any task I threw at it. It is a sophisticated enough to endure through the years to come as its predecessors were not. I believe the 6 is that perfect phone that is just capable enough to readily handle any task you would, reasonably, throw at a mobile device. Realizing this, there really is no strong need to update to a newer phone ever again. At least for the next 5 years I am confident it will be a more than capable phone. The 6 has been, and still is, a bitchin phone. So what about the 7?
-
We have the staples of every iPhone upgrade -Battery-Screen-Camera-Speed. These come with every new iPhone with a couple new fun additions like -Touch ID-3D Touch-Stereo Speakers-Water Resistance-No headphone Jack. This year, as already discussed, the upgrades were boring and nonessential. This is the 7s flaw and advantage. This phone feels much more confident than both the 6 and 6S, and flaunts it as a monolith of beautiful technology. The 7 feels sturdy, gorgeous and powerful. I have never felt such awe of a device as I have this. I am pleased to have upgraded. Maybe the matte black look helps, however I have constantly been admiring how amazing the phone both looks and feel. Not to mention its bizarre and fantastic Home Button. Not to mention my excitement at any opportunity to use its excellent camera. Not to forget about the battery that just will. not. quit. I can barely contain my excitement (clearly) over this wonderful phone. 
-
Yet again and again I think about how, really and truly, nonessential the upgrade was. It did not feel necessary, but convenient. Before this, every upgrade felt like a vital step to keep up with the race of ever advancing technology. This race seemed to have peaked with the 6. Arguably even the 5S, but I will forgo it because of its form factor. No matter how much Apple tries to convince me to move from my 6 to my 7, the reasons have always felt vague to me. Courage? A silly answer they probably scraped for months to find. This is not a thought on my dissatisfaction with the 7, but with my worry over technology. It seems we have reared up against a brick wall in advancement. The only ""innovation"" in smartphone technology seems to be wireless charging and a ridiculous 4K, 5 inch screen. This seems a feeble way to fight off the inevitable notion. There has not been much advancement and there may not be in the the future. 
-
However, I do welcome the much needed refinements. Perhaps the technology has come so swiftly that a period for refinement is necessary. If so, the 7 is a golden move. This can also been seen in the flagship Galaxy series, of course. This of course can only make the announcement of the 10th anniversary iPhone or even the later 8 model feel all the more exciting. While I have doubt, I do hope the all-important-Apple has a few more strokes of genius left to offer. Something that heralds innovations once again. 
-
The 6 has been the perfect phone. I would still recommend it to any looking to buy a future-proof phone. But it is a lasting reminder of why I/we feel so bored with announcement of the 7. Only more refinement to be had. I was expecting the iPhone to feel like a new toy, when instead it feels like a more snug and familiar glove. Which is just fine, just not what anyone expected this year. 
-
So go enjoy your new iPhone 7. Take some killer photos. Handle all your daily tasks with fluidity and ease. Its a sensation unlike any other. A truly even more perfect phone. And those of you with you 5S/6/6S. Do not feel left out this year. The iPhone, it seems, is taking a year off of fun. Enjoy your older phone, it will handle anything you will throw at it just as any new fancy phone will. Lastly those of you with a 4/4S... FUCKING UPGRADE ALREADY.

I would greatly appreciate guidance in this matter before I move forward. Also please do not comment on how stupid I have been... that is a given.

Story: Basically I have $23,000 in school debt and $5,000 in credit card debt. Life was pretty hard and unstable and unfortunately I needed every lift I could get, despite the obvious downfalls. My parents had a nasty divorced and I became unable to finish school let alone support myself or my mother. It took a few years for us to get back on our feet, however now I have a decent serving job and I have finally been able to save about $5,000. Something to cushion me. My debt mostly went unpaid because working minimum wage 60 hours a week is still barely enough to live on. Between me and my mother, money was scarce. Paying debt was an option I chose to hold off until later. Now I have debt collectors asking for me and a potential lawsuit on school loans. It is soulcrushingly scary to say the least. I do wish I could have addressed this all before, but it has taken most of the past year to get myself back on my feet, so to speak. $5,000 is not a lot but it is just enough to feel safe. Safer than $100 a month like the last few years. So lets get to it...

Questions: I am entirely unsure how to proceed. I am here to ask in hope that I am not in a lose/lose situation. I hope there is a way out of this. How am I supposed to talk to these debt collectors. Since I received a voicemail using the word ""lawsuit"", are we past help? Finally my credit card debt is present, but I have not been asked to pay up yet. I assume I have a bit more time before they push my account onto a debt collector. Should this be my first focus?

Final: I am here looking for guidance, as I assume most people here are. I am not looking to be berated, just help with an ugly situation.

3. If I miss the preorder online, does the Apple store get a large shipment? If I buy a phone there can I add it to my monthly Verizon plan, or will I have to pay full price?

4. Buying at the Apple store. For those who go release night-before. How early do you advise to show up to get your desired phone? (I hear there have been release day shortages the past few years.)

I could name most the songs from Bleach and why they are important, however ""Life is Like a Boat"" is what hooked me to the show and thus anime and the whole genre of japanese influenced music. If any song were my Fullbring it would be this. Even now I can lay there all day and listen to this song. It is comforting and somehow this song feels appropriate for tonight. 

Bleach is special to us all for obvious and varied reasons. For me? It rocketed me into a very inspiring, dorky, and cool passion for anime. It is because of bleach that I have seen so many wonderful shows, from Space Dandy to Angel Beats to Clannad. 

The release of this final chapter is The End. The end of ""Clavar la Espada"", the end of ""Alones"" and the end of ""Life is Like a Boat"". Growing up as a teenager is strange and difficult. I feel Bleach was there for a lot of us. Angsty. Stylish. Cool. Damn cool. It spoke to me and its music was the driving factor. There was absolutely nothing (and nothing yet) like being so engrossed with the Soul Society Arc and getting goosebumps over ""D-technolife"". WHAT AN AWESOME FUCKING MOMENT. I had to look up UVERworld, I had to listen to ""Hakanaku"" and ""Shamrock"" and ""Chance! ""

Here listen to [Sen no yoru Wo Koete](https://vimeo.com/165988460)

Nothing like Senna fading away. I was lovesick. Young, dumb and lovesick. ""Tonight, Tonight, Tonight"" still feels so insanely chill. ""After Dark"" was D-technolife Pt. 2. I was AMPED, so insanely amped up for Hueco Mundo and Aizen. Asian Kung Fu Generation is now one of my favorite bands. Even as the show and filler wore on we were GRACED with ""Stay Beautiful."" 

""Quincy's Craft"", ""Into the Fire"", ""STAND UP BE FUUUUCKING STRONG!!!!!!!!!!!! NUMBAH ONE BABY!!!!""

I know I said I wouldnt talk about every other song. But how could I not, I know you were... Its through this music that I can lean back, close my eyes and remember where I was with every episode and every chapter. Where I was growing up. It was all thanks to Bleach.

Maybe it was Naruto for some, Inuyasha for others. Mine was Bleach. Ichigo, Zanpakuto, BAN----KAI!!!!! ""Life is Like a Boat"". Everytime the song played at the end of an episode it complimented the dark tone of the show. It spoke to me. It still speaks to me. It calls to some old long lost vibe in my being, reserved for my young wonderful teenage self. That vibe is rarely touched anymore now that I am older. It is tucked away somewhere with this song at the bottom of another thousand feelings and songs, in my personal library. 

Alright, thats getting pretty obtuse. But I am sure many of yall feel the same as me on some point here. Otherwise you wouldnt be reading this stupid long post on a Bleach community post. Fucking nerd. 

Last song you should play, [Going Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwbxrQAWxok) 

Ill pour one out for Bleach, its about the most adult thing I can do. The last chapter was here and gone like Christmas morning. Wonderful yet sad. Very sad. Very, very empty. I am sure that is all I will be able to feel. As she says, Life is Like a Boat.

Nobody knows who I really am
I never felt this empty before
And if I ever need someone to come along
Who's gonna comfort me, and keep me strong

We are all rowing the boat of fate
The waves keep on comin' and we can't escape
But if we ever get lost on your way
The waves would guide you thru another day

Till next time,
GF

I found the series to have just as much animey bullshit but it felt more cohesive. As I anticipate the next chapter of Bleach I am reminded of some strange plot threads left dangling in the dark. We had illusions to Orihime's powers and back stories to great characters, like Unohana, left unrevealed. While I do not think Naruto was perfect, it felt well planned and even emotional in its outcomes. A fight was, usually, not just a fight, but a conduit to explain a character and help the reader expand their perception of the character. Bleach has been great fun this past few years, but so far these fights just feel like an excuse to see a long awaited Bankai. I think the reason the Espada fights (in Hueco Mundo) felt so fulfilling was because we got to see into the Espada's origin. The long awaited enemies had a past and an impetus to their character. It may not has been as grounded as Naruto's but it felt compelling. 

Here we are, mid 1000 Year War Arc, and the conflicts, introductions, and DRIVE to fight feel forced. I am TOLD that Quincies and Shinigami hate each other, this is the base reason for this war, however I was never shown any atrocity or anecdote that leads me to feel this war is necessary. But I think I am getting off track even here. The fight with Aizen felt REAL. I knew why everyone was so invested in the battle. We read about it/watched it for years. Ichigo, saving Rukia, the danger of hollows and the threat of arrancar/ ESPADA! When watching Ichigo and crew blaze into Hueco Mundo (read: After Dark Opening) I KNEW why I was there EVERY. SINGLE. WEEK. When Ichigo stopped Grimmjow BAREHANDED because he absolutely could not lose, I knew why. it was understandable. IT WAS REAL. Teenage me knew it. I know it. 

If Naruto has shown me anything, in juxtaposition, it is that Bleach has no UMPH! I love seeing these new Bankais. I have dreamed all my young days to see Urahara KickASS (and how freaking great was it?!), but where is the EMOTION, THE PASSION?

THE PASSION?!

Naruto was fueled by brotherhood and loneliness. Friendship and betrayal. Family. Different Values than those represented in Bleach, but tangible. BELEIVE IT. What an awful line. But I cannot dock the series for wearing its heart on its sleeve, through and through. It made the battles intriguing and it made the reason to read so worth it. When Kakashi and ---to finally fight together. WOW. I stared at that page for half an hour. I think this is why we found the Hueco Mundo Arc and especially the Soul Society Arc so wonderful.

I have felt strange about Bleach lately, I did not know why. Maybe because I am 23, an ""adult"", maybe the silliness of anime does not capture m in the same way. But... then why did Naruto? Still stupid, still anime, but heartfelt and emotional. Bleach has felt strange because these 26 Sternritter are unknown to me, then they die. There are no consequences, just fireworks.

Before anyone tells me to ""just stop fucking reading and complaining then"" I want to say I still hold hope. Bleach is my first anime, straight off of Adult Swim late night, every night in the summer. I just wanted to discuss where everyone else is with the series. I want to know if everyone feels as strangely disconnected as I do. This is not a comparison or VS on Naruto. I know we still have a ways to go, many chapters and maybe years ahead of us. It just sparked my thought.

Ive had my alcohol, Ive written a ton, Ill let yall do the rest. Thanks Guys.

I'll start by saying I think SWL is a fine idea, but is a lot like Radiator Springs in a few ways. Cars land was a fast reaction to a huge merchandising fire that Cars had started. It would be like creating a Frozen Land and lo and behold everyone is exhausted of Frozen, even children. Now we are stuck with a huge sore spot in the shape of Radiator Springs. The theme is lame and no one is connected to the idea. Why so specific? Why not Pixar Land? The theme is broad and well loved. I feel SWL could very well be in the same vain. The only difference being Star Wars might be a large enough identity to survive on its own. 

My main gripe lies in its placement at DISNEYLAND. Of all places. Replace RS for all I care, at least put it in the poorly identified California Adventure. There really is not much coherence in its build. SWL would at least fit well here. But in Disneyland?! Here we have The lands (themes) of Fantasy, Frontier, Tomorrow, New Orleans, Critter Country, Toons, and Adventure. These are (with a couple small exceptions) broad ideas or themes that feel both traditional and capture the imagination. With Fantasy comes thoughts of Knights, Dragons, magic, love. With Tomorrow comes thoughts of the future and space and invention. These sections of Disneyland encompass many of Disneys IPs, even Star Wars fire in Tomorrowland. Done. Add a Star Wars ""section"" and a few rides and call it. I'm looking at Magic Kingdoms Fantasyland expansion. Classy. Yet smack near the most traditional of places in Disneyland we have Star Wars right next to Mark Twain and Tom Sawer and Winnie the Pooh. Who thought this was a good plan? Even if Star Wars is not a broad theme it completely interferes with Disneylands old time feel and charm. All of this just to CASH OUT on the hype of Star Wars over the coming few years. I know it will make BILLIONS of dollars but this is just wrong. It's tactless. 

As if RS was not bad enough we have yet another movie getting a its own land. This space could have been used for a very meaningful more traditional expansion to Disneyland, maybe like Imaginationland or some expansion.

It saddens me to see this happening to Disneyland. It feels cheap and shortsighted and most of all downright infuriating. I'm sure other here feel the same. Just wanted to vent and discuss.

Dumbledore is actually himself, Its nearly scene for scene with the books and feels like the true film incarnation of the books. The reasons are obvious. 

The 3rd and 4th movies while they have a distinctly different feel under the new director, I think they still hold up very well compared to the books. Dumbledore pretty much stinks, but they hold rather true to form and I actually enjoy their darker tone. Although I do wish they could have kept it a little more ""magical"" like the first two movies.

The last four start to fumble. I am not calling them bad. Actually considering the sheer material they have to sift through, the mostly coherent plot and callouts are good. However, these films are just random sometimes and at some points are too jumbled. From the outside almost none of it holds up, and thats the problem.

The first four movies can viewed by my mother and I am confident she would understand what is going on, But during the last four movies I feel sorry for her having to sit through them. They practically make no sense and lose that flair of magic and awe.

I didnt mean to rant just felt need to express this and see how people feel.

tl;dr - The first two movies are magical and very faithful to the source. The third and fourth movies look different but mostly contain the flair of the first two movies. The last four movies are an odd jumbled set, that are not as enjoyable to watch. They do make a valiant effort at the job though.
