If it's meant to be, it's meant to be.  He asked the first girl out, and I think they dated once or twice but didn't last.  Now, after dating a couple of girls he would have never asked out,  he is married to a gorgeous girl that has an amazing personality and I have the cutest little nefew.

Basically what's the worst that can happen? She says no? So? Now atleast you know and can move on.

Like I said in another post on in this sub when I was talking about what I tell people to try to get them to try paleo:

&gt;I tell them everyone is different and affected differently by things, so you have to find what works for you. Try the paleo diet hardcore for a month, then change only one variable for a week, don't jump completely off the ship. If you miss yogurt the most, try yogurt and see how it affects you. If it doesn't affect you negatively or you can deal with the effects, then keep eating. Keep doing it for all the stuff you miss. This way you know what effects your body and you also know how it feels at optimal health.

I know you have probably heard most of this but maybe one or two things will be something knew you can talk to him about:

The way I try to convince people to try paleo is that I tell them its not a fad or get someone trying to get rich selling placebos.  They don't ask you to buy a special pill or drink.  They mainly tell you to take out all the processed foods out of your diet.  

I tell them that it is deigned to bring you back to a diet that if a caveman existed today, in a place that had all the variety in food we have today, he would be able to eat.  

I also point out that in the 2.5 millions years humans have been around, we have only started eating grains in the last roughly 10,000 years and eating/drinking dairy in roughly the last 5,000 year.  

So if you scaled that 2.5 million years down from one end zone (0 yard line) to the other end zone, we would have just started eating grains 4 inches from the end zone and dairy 2 inches from the end zone. (not sure if this is exact but its what I remember from seeing in a documentary, and i could be wrong.)  

If you only took this into consideration, you could kinda see that possibly we are not designed to ingest grains or dairy, but I always love to point out and ask them what happens after they eat corn on the cob?  You pass most of it, and you can see it the next day.  That is because our body can not process whole grains until the are mechanically or thermodynamically broken down before we eat them. Just like if you ate the raw grain ingredients of bread, your body would not be able to break down most of it.

I tell them everyone is different and affected differently by things, so you have to find what works for you.  Try the paleo diet hard core for a month, then change only one variable for a week, don't jump completely off the ship.  If you miss yogurt the most, try yogurt and see how it affects you.  If it doesn't affect you negatively or you can deal with the effects, then keep eating.  Keep doing it for all the stuff you miss.  This way you know what effects your body and you also know how it feels at optimal health.

22,"Yeah I have simular problems.  

If I ingest anything with wheat in it now, even the last ingredient, I have all the celiac symptoms.  My grandmother was dianotics with celiac, and since you have to eat gluten for a month before you get tested, I just assume I have it now.

Dairy just makes my nose clog up, and makes me snore pretty bad according to my wife. I know I don't wake up as rested either as I use too. Usually only last a day tops.

Before I went on the paleo, I was a 21 year old that had sleep apnea and had to use to a cpap machine.  I have snored my whole life, but I never realized how bad it was (other than my wife telling me) until I went in for my sleep test.  They told me that the normal snore index was 200.  Mine was 2000.  One week into hardcore paleo diet, and I wasn't snoring at all!

I kinda think that before that paleo diet, we had built up a tolerance for dairy and wheat that subdued the negative effects. Then, when we went on the paleo diet, our intestines healed and we developed new good bacteria for our diet and body (some studies say it only takes 24 hours of diet change to develope them).  So now when we try to eat something our body is not originally designed for, and hasn't built up a modified system to handle it, so we receive all the negative side effects because our bodies see it as an infection and fights it by flushing our systems and causing inflammation to contain it.    

Just my opinion.  No medical/nutritional background at all.",2015-10-26 18:14:11+00:00,cwdm8xs,1,t3_3qay6r,3128,Paleo

37,"I live out of hotels for work.  I have listed below some of the tips I have learned over the years that hopefully may be able to help you.

Right off the bat, go to a hardware or big box store and grab a fridge thermometer. I paid around $5 for mine and it has saved me alot money. It is so hard to dial in the temperature on the hotel refrigerators with out one, but now I am not freezing my lettuce and other produce.

Chicken salad you don't have to cook:
Rotisserie chicken, lettuce, toppings from the produce section,  and zipable sandwich bags.  The rotisserie chickens are great because they are already cooked and cheap! I take the chicken, shredded it, and portion it into sandwich bags.  I also have a cheap knife with a sleeve (makes travel easy) and a small cutting board that I use to chop up some peppers, onions, and what ever else looks good in the produce section. After chopping it all up, I also put it all into individual sandwich bags. (I know they are not the most environment friendly option but they take up alot less space than plastic containers in those tiny hotel fridges, they are cheap, and I don't have to clean them when I am done!) Now with all your prep work done, throw all the bags into a grocery bag and toss them in the refrigerator. When you want a salad, just pull out the grocery bag and some lettuce. Throw the chicken in the microwave if you want it hot and build a delicious salad with the rest of your ingredients. This is a cheap, easy, and healthy alternative to going out all the time.

You mentioned you had a crockpot. Do you have crockpot liners? If not, get some! They are a life saver, especially in a hotel room. They are a giant plastic bags that you line your crockpot with and for some magical reason, do not melt. When you are done, you pull the bag out and throw it away, leaving behind a clean crockpot with nothing burnt along the edges to clean up. You can usually find them in most grocery stores next to the zip lock bags.

Also, I travel with an electric skillet with a lid and a 6'x3'ish folding table that is adjustable to multiple heights, including its top heights that is equivalent to most kitchen counters heights. Most hotels do not want you to cook on their furniture, but when I tell them I will be cooking on my own table, most of the time they are ok with me cooking in the room.  I try to stay away from most foods that make a mess when you cook them (making sure to leave the lid on as much as possible) or will stink up the whole room. Stuff like bacon is a no ago! The hotels are nice enough to allow me to cook so I try my best to respect the room for the next guest.


Cleaning:
Ahhh the fun part of living in a hotel.... sinks are always tiny and make a pain to clean up any cooking device. I use to struggle until a friend let me in on a little secret I had never thought of for some reason, the bath tub. I felt so stupid for never thinking of this, but God has it made cleaning so much easier!

I usually just buy a sponge with a scrub pad and some dishwashing soap. I do most of my cleaning in the tub. It's more open than the sinks and makes cleaning so much easier. If I have alot of let over food bits and stuff in what I am cleaning, I'll either try to whip most of it into a trash can with a paper towel or flush it down the toilet to keep from clogging up the bath tub. 

I am sorry for any typos and miss spellings, but I am writing this on a phone. I hope some of this will help you. Sorry to hear about your house, but I am glad your family is safe!

Edit: I just remembered this. Frozen veggies in the steam bags! They are really easy, taste alot better then can veggitables, and save you from having to clean another pot or pan.",2015-08-17 14:31:39+00:00,cu5w499,1,t3_3h9fzt,47498,Cooking
