I have created a cell to the right of the cell the users needs to change that subtracts the 2 cells and set solver to manipulate the cell as an integer until the subtraction cell is within -1 and 1.

I was hoping to create a macro keyboard shortcut that would run the solver for whatever cell is currently selected.

Here is what I created with the actual cells referenced:

    Sub Solver2()
    '
    ' Solver2 Macro
    '

    '

        SolverOk SetCell:=""$D$13"", MaxMinVal:=2, ValueOf:=0, ,yChange:=""$E$13"", Engine _:=1, EngineDesc:=""GRG Nonlinear""
        SolverAdd CellRef:=""$D$13"", Relation:=1, FormulaText:=""1""
        SolverAdd CellRef:=""$D$13"", Relation:=3, FormulaText:=""-1""
        SolverAdd CellRef:=""$E$13"", Relation:=4, FormulaText:=""integer""
        SolverOk SetCell:=""$D$13"", MaxMinVal:=2, ValueOf:=0, ByChange:=""$E$13"", Engine _:=1, EngineDesc:=""GRG Nonlinear""
        SolverOk SetCell:=""$D$13"", MaxMinVal:=2, ValueOf:=0, ByChange:=""$E$13"", Engine _ :=1, EngineDesc:=""GRG Nonlinear""
        SolverSolve UserFinish:=True
        SolverFinish KeepFinal:=1
    
     End Sub

And here is what I tried and can not get to work:

    Sub Solver2()
    '
    ' Solver2 Macro
    '
    
    '
    SolverReset
    
        SolverOk SetCell:=""ActiveCell.Offset(0, -1).Activate"", MaxMinVal:=2, ValueOf:=0, ByChange:=""ActiveCell.select"", Engine _
            :=1, EngineDesc:=""GRG Nonlinear""
        SolverAdd CellRef:=""ActiveCell.Offset(0, -1).Activate"", Relation:=1, FormulaText:=""1""
        SolverAdd CellRef:=""ActiveCell.Offset(0, -1).Activate"", Relation:=3, FormulaText:=""-1""
        SolverAdd CellRef:=""$E$13"", Relation:=4, FormulaText:=""integer""
        SolverOk SetCell:=""ActiveCell.Offset(0, -1).Activate"", MaxMinVal:=2, ValueOf:=0, ByChange:=""ActiveCell.select"", Engine _
            :=1, EngineDesc:=""GRG Nonlinear""
        SolverOk SetCell:=""ActiveCell.Offset(0, -1).Activate"", MaxMinVal:=2, ValueOf:=0, ByChange:=""ActiveCell.select"", Engine _
            :=1, EngineDesc:=""GRG Nonlinear""
        SolverSolve UserFinish:=True
    SolverFinish KeepFinal:=1
        
    End Sub


Everytime I try to run the above code, the only thing that happens is excel turns to manual calculations and ""Setting up problem..."" is displayed in the bottom left corner.

Does anyone have an input?  Can I create what I am actually trying to do?

I jokingly told her I was going to find the hottest sauce possibly and see if it would even make her blink. She took the bluff.

I was going crazy watching Larry Butler in the youtube video, ""Winmau World Masters 2015 Day 3"" starting around 5:50:00.  I know it is rare for an American to make it that far.  His quarter final match vs Martin Adams was crazy (I loved that announcer! I have never heard someone so into something!).

I came on here and saw the post ""Who are your top 3 active players you love and hate the most?"" I realized that I didn't really know any of them.  I basically only know MVG, Taylor and now Bulter and Adams, but I would like to start watching and following more.

So in my roundabout way,  what do y'all do in the States or do the fellow darters from across the pond have any suggestions?  Would also be really interested in following the big American Tournaments if you have any suggestions.
