 Please explain how the iPhone 7 is leaps and bounds behind the competition...I can't see it. I'll give you the lower resolution, but it's still a damn good screen.   
 Battery is purely anecdotal to use cases. I might get a day and half on charge normally but you might get only until noon. It depends on how each person uses the phone. Almost every flagship will make it a day for most people.   
 Worse camera? It hasn't even been thoroughly tested yet, but let's build off of last years..the only camera that beat it was the S7 and Note 7. And even that came down to user preference. So top 3, but leaps and bounds behind competition?

414,"&gt;  Is there a such thing as an independent phone, as in not one from a cell company but just an unlocked version?

Yes, you'd buy [this](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-S7-Factory-Unlocked/dp/B01CJU9BBM?ie=UTF8&amp;m1k=d_ac&amp;tag=androidcentralb-20) one. The ""F"" model. 

&gt; I know from my research that Cricket runs on the AT&amp;T network, but what makes the AT&amp;T phone better than the T-Mobile if they're both using GSM? I thought the GSM was all that mattered (though I'm open to all feedback, as I just learned about the difference between CDMA and GSM today), but based on your comment, it appears there are further complications. I've just gone where I order most things, Amazon, and I've looked up what the different model codes mean and found both the AT&amp;T version, as well as the T-Mobile.

Generally, if you're not going to bother unlocking the bootloader/rooting it's best to buy the phone that was designed specifically for the network you are going to be using it on. That is the only reason I said that.

The google voice parking is just another way to say, port your number to google voice. This way, you order a sim from cricket(or buy one at gamestop), activate and they'll give you a number. Forward that number to your google voice number and if you get on a family plan that goes sour you only lose the forwarding number, not the number that you actually give out to people. So if that did happen, you would be out the $20 you paid for the month and $10 more for a new sim card. Hence why I said you'd be out $30. If you call them to activate your account you'll skip the $25 in store activation fee. 

&gt; Effectively you can get 7.5 GB a month for about 24 dollars.
&gt; This part I'm not quite following. Care to elaborate?

Your plan is usually $20/month for 2.5 gb of data. Once you use those 2.5 gb, you can either just ride out till the end of the month at throttled speeds or you can call/go on the website and change your plan. If you change your plan to the 5 gb plan, you'll make a payment right then, usually for around $5 or less, depending on the number of days left in the month. You'll recieve all 5 gb. Making it 7.5 gb for the month. The night before you pay your bill, call again/log back in on the computer and change your plan back to the 2.5 gb one. Usually they'll refund you close to a dollar back. You can do this every single month if you feel like it. Note you can only make two plan changes a month per line, so make sure you go up high enough to cover the rest of the month. I've only had to do this 4 or 5 times but it's really nice that it is available. 

You're not really sticking it to AT$T...you're using a lesser form of their network, the excess that would have not been used anyways, and receiving far less speeds than their postpaid customers. However, for myself, the 9 mbps is plenty for mobile. I can stream HD video from my plex server all day every day on it. It more than meets my needs.

417,"Month to month. You could do it yourself for 35 with auto pay. So 65 with phone included. Yes you'd have to buy outright, definitely do not buy a cricket branded phone. I'd personally look at T-Mobile versions as they are generally unlockable, if you are the root and ROM type. If not, buy the att version. It will work the best on cricket. 

As far as trusting other people, that'd be up to you. Personally I'd park my number with Google voice and not worry, at most you'd be out 30 bucks if they messed you over. Most people on that sub are there to save money so I'd say they'd be straight up.


I do the 5 lines for 100 with family and it's awesome. 20 a month for talk and text, 2.5 GB of data. If you go over, go on the website and change the plan for the month. Before you pay for the next month, change it back. You can do this every month. Effectively you can get 7.5 GB a month for about 24 dollars.

You are almost guaranteed to have better service on Verizon, unless you live in a freak zone with horrible Verizon coverage. Sprint and T-mobile have the worst coverage combined so...Project Fi is only for metropolitan areas.

Then I would invest in various other anime studios to try and subtlety change the frenetic pace that anime is released at to up the quality.

874,"&gt; Internet and Mail
&gt; 
&gt; why gmail and mail? why internet and chrome? doesnt google make android? why isnt the default browser just chrome? can/should i delete mail/internet if my preference is to use gmail/chrome?

While Google owns Android, it's free to use and customize. Chrome and Gmail are actually Google's customization and Internet and Mail apps are AOSP, as in bone stock Android's version of those apps. You can feel free to hide them/freeze them without worry.    

   
&gt; Ringtones
&gt; 
&gt; i cant figure out how to put my old ringtones on my new phone. All my old tones are .m4r so i dunno if maybe they arent compatible? How do i download ringtones directly to the phone?

Just download Zedge or another ringtone app. Your old ringtones are more than likely on there as well, unless they were custom ones you made yourself.

&gt; Music
&gt; 
&gt; I downloaded music manager and loaded up my music. currently downloading the albums to my phone. Not all songs got transferred to my music. Why? some albums are missing hundreds of songs I read something about some DRM, maybe its that? Is this the best way to get my itunes library onto my S6? can i not just drag and drop my music from my computer to the phone? is there an itunes like manager for android?

Doubletwist is the go to for managing itunes collections on Android, or it was. I don't know nowadays, haven't used itunes for anything other than podcasts.

&gt; Themes
&gt; 
&gt; I'm already using some great looking themes... but not all the apps change to match the theme. Is that just the nature of the beast? Seems like only 3rd party apps dont change.

Themes would change the system apps and any apps included in the theme. If the theme developer didn't include the app, it's not going to be themed.

&gt; Misc
&gt; 
&gt; Any good articles that you know of the help me transition would be great.
&gt; What are some essential apps i should get?
&gt; widgets you cant live without?
&gt; i was using alien blue to browse reddit on my iphone, i cant find it in the play store. only ""reddit is fun"". is this the best reddit app?

There's plenty of posts here in /r/Android that cover essential apps,  widgets are so 2012 and Reddit is Fun is the app I personally use. Don't know if it's the best.
