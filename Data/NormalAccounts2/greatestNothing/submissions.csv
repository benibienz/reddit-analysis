Mobo: asus m5a99fx pro r2.0   
Stock CPU cooler

Hello, about a week or two ago my computer shut off after a warning popping up in the corner that CPU temp was at 65c. It shut off a minute or two later. When I went to turn it back on it would spin the fans for about 5 seconds and then power off. If I depower the mobo and hit the memory test button 2 seconds or so after boot I can get it to boot up and run fine, it will software reset but a cold shutdown and power on fails, unless i run the memory test. Since the I've been paying attention to the cpu temp through asus suite II. CPU temp will never get below 46c. Seems awfully high for idle. Also since the computer shut off the first time..things aren't working. Onboard USB ports in the rear won't power my wifi usb receiver, and today the audio just stopped working. I tried today to install a corsair h100i v2 but couldn't get it mounted correctly in my case and the stock backplate was loose as hell, didn't like that. So i packed that back up, applied thermal paste(pea sized, let the cooler spread it), and put the stock cooler back on. No change. 

Also, I tried to run Prime95, it shut the computer off within a second of hitting start.
