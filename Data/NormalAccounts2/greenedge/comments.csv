I think the reason she got a lot of hate is because her outfits and behavior seemed desperate and unauthentic(opinions vary)like the meat suit for example. Many accused her of ""peacocking"" which apparently is when you dress in an odd or distracting fashion to draw attention away from perceived insecurities/flaws.

35,"He absolutely does have a point. Why are you ok with blaming people who have had nothing to do with slavery, racism, and discrimination? It's obvious that black people(any minority really) have been treated horribly in America, but what the fuck does that have to do with me? I never owned slaves, I've never met anyone who was ever a slave. It's like if I complained that because my great great grandmother was a slave (in Italy) I should be entitled to some sort of special treatment. The expression 2 wrongs don't make a right rings true. No one is arguing whether or not black people used to be treated inhumanely, I'm simply arguing that it has nothing to do with people  who never practiced the space trade or racial discrimination. When will it end? Are we gonna start this train of white guilt for us to feel bad for the Native Americans, black people, the Chinese, the Irish? Who else's unfortunate treatment  are we expected to take the blame for next?
