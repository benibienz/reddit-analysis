I have been wanting to expand my career into the field of Cyber Security( I have done a few things with penetration testing using Kali Linux), I was wondering if I would benefit more from a associate/bachelor in cyber security or from certifications. The certification that I think will be useful are as follows:
Certified Computer Examiner (CCE)
Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)
Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)
Cisco Certified Design Associate (CCDA)
Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)
Cisco Certified Network Professional (CCNP)
CompTIA A+
CompTIA Linux+
CompTIA Network+
CompTIA Security+
Computer Security Incident Handler (CSIH)
LPICÂ­-1
Microsoft Certified IT Professional (MCITP)
Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert (MCSE)
Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert/Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate (MCSE/MCSA)
Mobile Forensic Certified Examiner (MFCE)
There are some on this list that I doubt will be of use(such as comptia a+ lol)
Which of these certifications are worth it?
Would you hire someone in the field of CyberSecurity with these credentials?
Overall what can I do to further myself into this rapidly growing field?
Any and all help is greatly appreciated. If you have any questions for me just ask.

We're clearly connected to the internet and can access other secure pages such as financial institutions. Whenever we run the update we get error code 12029(unable to utilize our web connection). It should also be noted that we have a shared network drive that we utilize so we don't have to purchase the multi user version license. These all worked prior to the upgrade to windows 7.
