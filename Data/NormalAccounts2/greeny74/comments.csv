It's been a non-stop party here in Chicago. The Cubs won the World Series (God DAMN it feels good to say that) and I've been reveling in the awesomeness. While I did not go to the parade and rally today, about FIVE MILLION people did, so that should give you all an idea on how big a deal this is.

Unfortunately, in my super-excited celebrations of the final out, I broke my foot. So I'm not moving around too much right now. Going to the doctor in a few days to see the extent of the damage.

While the vocal songs are always terrific, sometimes the score sets the real tone of the show, and some of the most crucial moments of RWBY would not be the same without the beautiful score that you have a hand in creating. Seriously, you are terrific!

A couple questions, if you wouldn't mind answering:

1. Do you have a favorite particular RWBY song lyric(s)? 

2. How hyped should we be for the music in Volume 4?

- WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIGHT!. Still makes me giggle.

- More evidence that Nora is the best. One-hits all of Team BRNZ.

- Debut of our favorite drunk uncle.

- Oh my God, you could grind meat on those- I mean, hello, Team SSSN

- Gavin as Scarlet is still perfect. 

- WATER WEENIE shows his true colors

- Best battle music in V3 IMO

- Poor Sage. Out of the fight almost immediately.

- I have a soft spot for pirates, maybe that's why I like Scarlet so much.

- ME GENNIES, SUN!

- Oh STOP BEING SUCH A WATER WEEINE, NEPTUNE

- OH BABY A TRIPLE!

- Drunk uncle is drunk.

- Most underrated song of of V3. Blake, contain yourself.

______________________________________________________________________

*Thwack!*

The log split with such force the two halves went flying across the yard. they each came to rest in separate piles equally distant from the block. Each pile was now the size of small car.

As pointless as it was to chop so much wood, Yang had gotten quite efficient doing it with only one hand.

At first, she had been so horrible, she couldn't even properly sink the blade of the ax into the wood. It was only after many hours of practice that Yang could split the logs with such efficiency. 

Of course, Yang had nothing but time on her hands. Since Beacon was still a Grimm-infested ruin, Yang spent all of her time at her family home on Patch. The woods surrounding the quaint little cabin provided her with plenty of material to vent her pent up aggression on.

Yang sighed as she sunk the ax into the chopping block. She had been going at it for 5 hours without a break. In that time she had managed to get lost in the rhythm of her work. There wasn't anything else for her to do around the house...or even anyone else to talk to. Her father, Taiyang, had left a few days ago. And Ruby...

Ruby had been gone since winter. The only thing she left behind was a note explaining that she was going to find out who was behind the atrocities that befell the kingdom of Vale the previous fall. Taiyang was so distraught that he desperately looked for any lead as to where Ruby may have gone, if only to bring her back safe and sound. When he received a report of a small village in Mistral being saved from a Grimm attack by a group of underage Huntsmen, he took off, trying to run down a possible lead on his daughter's whereabouts. Leaving Yang here all be herself.

It didn't bother Yang as much as it used to. She had always been a loner type of person, except when there was someone to protect. But with everyone now gone, she was only left to herself. Just her and the birds.

One particularity large crow sat in the bushes next to the house, eyeing Yang with an strange look on its face.

Yang sat on the edge of the chopping block and let out a sigh. ""You might as well show yourself.""

The crow morphed into a lanky grizzled man with a tattered red cape. ""So you knew it was me.""

Yang scoffed. ""Of course. No crow is bigger than you, Uncle.""

Qrow smiled. ""Are you calling me fat, little firecracker?""

""Maybe.""

Qrow jutted his head towards the piles of wood. ""I see you've been keeping yourself busy. You keep up this pace and Patch will be deforested within a year.""

Yang turned and looked at Qrow with disdain. ""You obviously came here for a reason, so get to the point. Otherwise, just leave me alone.""

Qrow spread his hands. ""I bring news of your sister.""

Yang's expression softened a bit. ""Ruby? How is she? She's not-""

""She's fine. Not hurt"" Qrow said quickly. ""Quite the opposite, in fact. She and her other friends have been kicking some serious butt for a their age. She actually saved a village on the edge of Mistral. Took down a Beringel, if you can believe it.""

Yang grunted and looked down at the dirt. A thin smile crept on her face. ""Ruby always was an over-achiever.""

Qrow walked over to his niece and set a hand on her shoulder. ""She misses you, of course. You should go to her.""

Yang shrugged off Qrow's touch and got up. She walked towards the house, shaking her head. ""No, I shouldn't. I'd be useless out there.""

Qrow scoffed. ""You wouldn't be useless. You need to break yourself out of this funk."" He walked up to Yang and spun her around to face him. Rusty eyes burned into soft lilac. ""I get it. You lost an arm. Your friends either died or left you. Big deal."" 

Yang started to open her mouth but Qrow cut her off. ""That doesn't mean you get to use that as an excuse. The same thing happened to Ruby. She lost people too. But she's overcoming that. It's time for you to do the same.""

Yang growled and shoved her uncle away. ""What do you expect me to do?"" she screamed. Lilac eyes turned crimson, as she stormed towards Qrow, forcing him back. ""I can't fight with just one arm! What good is fighting back if you can't actually do anything!""

Qrow swept his arm towards the piles of wood. ""You're telling me you're incapable, when you are personally responsible for cutting down half the trees on this damn island? That just tells me that you're channeling your energy into the wrong place.""

Yang stopped and glared at her uncle, her single hand balled into a fist.

Qrow looked at his niece with a hint of amusement. ""You're angry. Good. But I'm not the one you should be angry at. You should channel that anger, that rage, and loose it on the people responsible for this mess. And you and I both know where you can find those people.""

Qrow turned to leave. ""I've got to get going. When you change your mind, You'll know where to find me.""  He stopped for a moment and turned back towards Yang. ""You talk about being alone here. Even though Ruby is with those other kids, she is just as alone as you. She could really use someone who knows how she feels.""

What that, Qrow turned and morphed into his namesake, and flew off into the cloudy sky, leaving Yang amongst the huge piles of wood.

Tonight marks the end of a truly rough patch in my life. But after fighting through it and finally putting in the work to get out of it, I am extremely proud to say that I am no longer homeless after over three years of being so.

I finally got approved for a new housing program in my area, and I completed the move-in process this morning. This is the first night in 3 years that I won't have to travel from shelter to shelter or stay in a hotel, sleeping on a plastic pad less than a foot off the ground. I feel that my life is finally heading in the right direction. And a big reason as to why I have not lost it in the last few years is being able to find things to be happy about. Namely, the RT and RWBY communities. You guys are the fucking best. Thank you all for everything you do to make this the best damn place on the internet. You guys are good fucking people.

No prior experience, but I've always wanted to give it a shot.

* **Will you be watching RWBY when it airs or will you be waiting until the public release?**

I am a sponsor so I will be watching as soon as it becomes available.

* **Do you have the time in your schedule to keep up with the sub? Also, what timezone are you in?**

My schedule is completely open during normal daylight hours. Nighttime is a bit less reliable, but I normally still available up until around 9-10pm. I am located in the US Central Time zone (same as Austin TX, RT HQ)

* **How long have you been a part of this community? How active are you?**

I have been a member of /r/RWBY since August 2014, right around the middle of Volume 2. I am very active on the subreddit, constantly sharing art and fanfiction from throughout the RWBY community.

* **Why do you want to join the mod team?**

The /r/RWBY subreddit is the first real Internet community that I've ever really been immersed in. Even when I was a noob everybody was (and still is) incredibly nice and open. You guys accept any and all who love the World of Remnant. The attitude I've experienced here has also rubbed off onto my personal life, allowing me to become a lot more cheerful and open. I think keeping this sub a clean safe place to bask in the show that we love is a task that I would love to help with.

* **Any additional information you think would be relevant to your application.**

Nothing really, except that you are all swell people no matter who or what you are :)

Also, Mod Green would look nice with my username. Just sayin' ;)

In fact, he's a freaking idiot for letting himself get so angry and livid that he started swearing without realizing what exactly he was saying.

Hockey players curse CONSTANTLY. Foreign players even curse in their own native tongues so no one can understand them. By being suspended one game, Shaw is now the NHL's precedent for this type of behavior.

1966,"My first job in high school was working in a movie theater. Once after a particularly busy night, I was tasked with cleaning one of our popcorn machines. Normally we would shut the machines down and let them cool for a half-hour before cleaning but because it was already close to closing time I was told to clean it right away. So, as I'm cleaning this still-very-hot popcorn machine, my right forearm accidentally made contact with the kettle bowl. To say that I got burned was a huge understatement. I *heard* the flesh on my arm cook before I felt it. I was left with a shiny scar about the size of a quarter smack dab in the middle of my forearm.

**Gender?** I'm a dude!
 
**How old are you?** 25
 
**Where are you from?** Chicago, IL
 
**Do you have hobbies?** Bike riding, reading, writing, sleeping, watching hockey ([Blackhawks are best team](https://i.imgur.com/7RHiJib.jpg))
 
**What kind of music do you listen to?** Lots of alternative and punk rock 
 
**Favorite bands?** Rise Against, Trocadero, Jeff &amp; Casey Williams (duh)
 
**Favorite food?** Meat. Bonus points if preparation of said meat involves flames and BBQ sauce.

**Favorite Drink?** I liek chocolate milk. 
 
**How did you find RWBY?** After watching RT stuff on Youtube, I kept seeing RWBY on the sidebar and not knowing what it was. I gave in and started with Episode 1. Best decision ever. Of all time.
 
**Do you create anything for the fandom?** [I write fanfic!](https://www.fanfiction.net/~greeny74)(although nothing recently; that will change soon, I promise!) Give some of my stuff a read if your interested! Also, with the help of /r/RWBY, I created two massive RWBY Dance Party videos!

And, perhaps my greatest addition to this sub, [the best hype GIF in Remnant.](https://i.imgur.com/kYRtkH4.gifv)
 

**Favorite ship?** ARKOS WAS CONFIRMED, IF ONLY FOR A MOMENT. Also, Night's Watch is also near the top. All ships deserve recognition, however. Even the trash ones.
 
**Favorite Character?** So hard to pick just one, but it's basically a rotation of Ruby, Yang, Pyrrha, Neo, and Qrow.
 
**Any headcanons you'd like to share?** Nothing specific, but I acknowledge any and all potatoes.
 
**Anything interesting you'd like to share about yourself?** I've gotten to kiss the Stanley Cup twice in the last 3 years! [Here's photo proof of the most recent.](http://imgur.com/manAyRo) Hoping for a third time this summer!",2016-03-28 19:31:55+00:00,d1gpkip,1.0,t3_4cb1g2,8902.0,RWBY

2971,"The first time I ever saw Monty's work, I didn't even know it.

I was a sophmore in high school when Haloid was first released. For a young high-schooler who was desperate to avoid anything resembling actual schoolwork, Haloid provided the perfect distraction. Whenever I had access to a computer, my friends and I would watch Haloid at least once, even if we got in trouble for misusing the computer lab. The thing is, though, Haloid was so well made, I couldn't believe that one person did all this.

Eventually, though, time passed on and I got on with my life, with Haloid becoming just a memory.

Fast forward a few years, I started to rediscover Rooster Teeth in earnest, starting with Rage Quit and Achievement Hunter. Hungry for more content, I finally decided to watch Episode One of a little show called RWBY. I was blown away instantly. The fight choreography, the weapons, and characters, the music! It was all so incredible. I had to find out who made all this. Who was behind the masterpiece that I had just seen.

Monty Oum. The name sounded so familiar. I looked up his past work, and discovered that this was the same person who created the video that was almost single-handedly responsible for introducing me to a whole new world of content.

I devoured every scrap of Monty's work I could find. I started watching RWBY in the middle of Volume 2. I was so immersed in the show, I was caught up in an couple hours. I tore through every single episode, then went back and immediately watched them again. I discovered Dead Fantasy, and fell in love with that as well. I caught up on Red vs. Blue and discovered the Freelancer Saga. Withing the span of a couple months, Monty's work became an inseparable part of my life. When I saw Monty's drive create, it inspired me to do the same. I started writing fanfiction based on RWBY to explore my creative output.

When the news first broke that Monty was in a coma, it felt like it wasn't real. Like someone was just kidding around. ""Haha, cool joke, Burnie."" But it slowly hit me that day that this was for real. The rest of that weekend I was lost in my mind. Even the Super Bowl that Sunday couldn't break me out of my funk, beacause I was glued to the internet, desperate for new on Monty's condition.

When the news broke the next day, I was at school. I saw Matt's journal, and I just broke down. I left my class without a word and went outside to a part of campus where I knew I would be alone. it was like -10 out with freezing wind, and I was out there in a thin hoodie. I didn't feel a thing. I just sat down and cried.

It felt like a chunk of my heart was ripped out of my chest. Here was this man who had created so much, and still had so much left to share. What was going to happen? Would RWBY die without it's driving force? There was so much uncertainty. Then I realized just how much Monty had actually done. How far he had planned ahead.

When RWBY Volume 3 debuted in October, all of my fears were instantly wiped out. The show still had it's Monty flair, whether it was by his own hand or by those he left behind to carry out his work. It was like he never left at all.

It's one year later. Every time I see a scene from RWBY, or a song from the soundtrack shuffles on my playlist, or a see a piece of badass fanart, I think of Monty Oum.

And how he is still here with all of us, in one way or another.",2016-02-01 15:58:30+00:00,czjsbp2,1.0,t3_43nh6x,29670.0,RWBY

A little background on this artwork:

This past Friday at Rooster Teeth's annual convention (RTX), the RWBY panel revealed some new info about the upcoming Volume 3, some of which was the reveal of a new character named Winter Schnee, the older sister of Weiss (one of the 4 main characters of RWBY). In my opinion, and several others, she seems very Satsuki-esque, and so that has been spawning all sorts of awesome artwork, including this piece. Not sure how this sub feels about crossovers, but I think this is pretty fantastic! ",2015-08-09 20:36:28+00:00,ctx7k22,1.0,t3_3gdumj,454.0,KillLaKill
