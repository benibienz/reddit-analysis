I post because I think they make some of the best engaging and accessible educational content on the internet, and I want to live in a world with a more educated populace.

Anyway, these are some of my favorites:

* PBS Space Time
* Healthcare Triage
* Minute Physics
* Minute Earth
* Brady Haran's Channels (Computerphile, Numberphile, etc.)
* SmarterEveryDay
* Vox
* Nerdwriter
* Kurz Gesagt
* Geography Now

* CGP Grey
* VSauce
* Every Frame a Painting
* Vihart
* 3Blue1Brown

A lot of people seem to find them useful, but if you don't, that's fine...spend your time elsewhere on reddit. Again, I have no relationship to these channels except that I'm a fan of them. The up/down votes are helpful as filters and tell me that at least a few people appreciate the videos in these subs. 

When I post to /r/videos yeah it's in part for the karma and also the hope that people will maybe learn something or become curious about the world... I post educational content that I'm a fan of (things that typically get posted anyway).
