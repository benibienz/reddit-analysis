ME: Hello, I'm interested in learning more about Shadow.GG.

CHRIS: Hello there! Thanks for getting in touch. Are you affiliated with a pro team?

ME: No, I am just an amateur player. I assume this is only available to professionals?

CHRIS: Yes, Shadow.GG is really geared towards the professional player; not that we want to keep you out but the features and dataset wouldn't really provide much benefit to you. :) But please keep posted on what we're up to, as we're planning some products for the amateur player for next year.

ME:I understand that, but could I ask why, even if i may not benefit us as much, why is it that StatsHelix and ShadowGG don't want at this stage non-pros using it?

CHRIS: That's a fair question. Shadow maintains a canonical set of matchplay data that is shared by all clients to the platform, as opposed to having each team upload and maintain their own library of matches.  That way we can ensure that every last bit of data is valuable to those pro teams that use the platform. That, and our pricing isn't generally affordable for an individual that wants to review matches for their own interest; we can't really just fling open the doors or the business model around the platform doesn't add up.  As I mentioned, we'll have something tailored more to the purposes of the average player who wants to improve their play on offer in 2017.

ME: Ok, thank you, that explains it quite nicely. Thanks for your time and I can't wait for a version I can use!",2016-11-03 16:55:11+00:00,d9k6nvc,5.0,t1_d9k63xm,620.0,GlobalOffensive
