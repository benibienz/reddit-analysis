Edit: So i found this article where the director explains it a bit more . He says that its not a 
documentary about lucha libre nor a Bio . It's a commercial  movie inspired by real life events that converts heroes in to superheroes and villains into supervillains.   So i guess thats why they used the term biographical fiction

Apple, other handset manufacturers use third-party labs certified by U.S. wireless industry’s trade group
Samsung’s battery crisis has put a spotlight on cellphone battery testing. 
By RYAN KNUTSON and  EUN-YOUNG JEONG
Updated Oct. 17, 2016 1:54 a.m. ET


The batteries used in Samsung Electronics Co.’s troubled Galaxy Note 7 were tested by a lab that belongs to the South Korean electronics giant, a practice that sets it apart from other smartphone manufacturers.

To sell smartphones at major U.S. carriers, phone makers are required to test phone batteries at one of the 28 labs certified by the U.S. wireless industry’s trade group, the CTIA, to ensure compliance with standards set by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.

Samsung is the only such manufacturer using in-house battery-testing facilities for CTIA certification, according to the association.

Samsung’s battery crisis has put a spotlight on cellphone battery testing, an otherwise mundane corner of a global industry that shipped some 1.9 billion units last year, according to research firm Gartner.


A spokesman for Samsung said its internal testing labs didn’t reveal any problems in the original and replacement Galaxy Note 7 phones. The device was recalled last month and then discontinued last week after original and replacement units caught fire.

Apple Inc. said it uses third-party CTIA-certified labs to test its batteries. Huawei Technologies Co. didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Lenovo Group Ltd.’s Motorola and Microsoft Corp.’s Nokia have operated CTIA-certified battery labs, though the association says both labs are being closed. Motorola said it tests batteries at its own labs but uses third-party labs for CTIA certification. Microsoft declined to comment.

In a statement Friday, Samsung said its plans to make “significant changes” in its quality-assurance processes in light of the Note 7 crisis. Samsung declined to comment on whether it has plans to use third-party labs for battery testing.

Tom Sawanobori, the chief technology officer at the CTIA, said the association audits test labs to ensure personnel are qualified, that they comply with standards, and that there is no undue influence from manufacturers. Test labs are typically in separate facilities and under separate control, he said.

“We’ve certified over 1,500 batteries,” he said. “This is the first time we’ve had an issue.”

Last week, engineers from CTIA certification labs gathered in Atlanta for an annual meetup. While the scuttlebutt was focused on what could be behind the Note 7’s battery problem, a CTIA representative told the gathering that neither the group nor Samsung would discuss it, two attendees said.

In the early 2000s, as cellphones were proliferating around the globe, a flood of cheap batteries from inexperienced manufacturers caused increasing failures, battery experts say. In response, the CTIA, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and the IEEE worked together in 2005 to create a voluntary program for battery testing, which the CTIA administers.

Eddie Forouzan, a member of the IEEE committee that developed the battery standard, says the process significantly reduced problems, and that safety failure rates in cellphone batteries went from being measured by the parts per million to the parts per billion. There have been at least 92 reports of batteries overheating in the Note 7, which went on sale in August.

Mr. Forouzan, who now runs his own lab in San Diego, says letting manufacturers test their own phones creates the potential for conflicts of interest.

John Copeland, who used to work for Motorola’s lab and now helps run a test lab in Atlanta, said it was normal for cellphone makers to use their own labs because it helps the companies protect trade secrets.

Phone makers are “very concerned about their proprietary information leaking out,” he said. Mr. Copeland said the audits were sufficient to ensure there wasn’t a conflict of interest.

Jason Howard, chair of the IEEE working group that wrote the battery certification standard, said that “on the outside that might make people nervous that a company is self certifying, but that’s common practice on a lot of standards.” Companies that use their own labs can get products out to market faster than if they had to wait in a queue at an outside test lab, Mr. Howard said.

Samsung has been testing phones at its internal CTIA-certified lab since 2009.

For CTIA certification, smartphone batteries are tested on their own and while being operated inside a device, says Kim Tae-young, director at the Korea Testing Laboratory, the only other CTIA-certified battery testing lab in South Korea. The tests mainly focus on whether batteries work properly while a phone is being charged or used for calls, which is when they are most likely to heat up. “We also put batteries in high temperatures that simulate summer conditions to monitor potential overheating or combustion hazards,” he said

A spokesman for Samsung said Thursday that it is “working around the clock” to identify causes for why some Note 7 devices caught fire and that it was “premature” to speculate on investigation outcomes.

Mr. Forouzan said he hopes Samsung quickly releases details about how the batteries failed so experts can determine if safety tests need to be improved. “They have to tell us what happened so we can fix it.”

Bodegas are hot.

Yes, the humble corner stores, with their grouchy cats and reams of toilet paper, are fast replacing the taxi and the bagel as a symbol of New York authenticity, lending urban credibility to any endeavor.

There’s Bodega, the clothing line, and Bodega, an art gallery on the Lower East Side. Not to mention the Bodega, a wine bar in Bushwick, and Bodega Pale Ale, a craft beer only distributed in New York.

Bodega 88, a sports bar, opened in August on the Upper West Side, in a former bodega.

“We had tons of names. That was the silly one, but for some reason, that’s the one everybody loved,” says Joe Del Monte, director of operations at its parent company, Main Street Restaurant Partners.

Like its namesake, Bodega 88 aims to attract patrons from all walks of life, he says.

Bodega Magazine, “your literary corner store,” is an online monthly whose founders met while studying creative writing at New York University.

Managing editor Cat Richardson says each issue provides a quick, accessible hit of contemporary fiction, poetry and creative nonfiction, with a few surprises thrown in.

“It has everything you need, like toilet paper, and then something unexpected,” she says.

Ms. Richardson doesn’t worry that bodegas are exclusive to New York. “I think most people have watched enough ‘Law &amp; Order’ that they are at least vaguely familiar with the term,” she says.

Mark Littman, founder of Bodega Studios, a video-production agency with offices in Chelsea and San Francisco, says the outfit’s name is a nod to its New York roots and personalized service. “You can get anything you want, any time you want, from a bodega,” he says.

These references work but feel imperfect. To my mind, a bodega is a very specific kind of corner grocery.

When I accidentally started smoking again last year, for example, I didn’t buy my Marlboros from the local deli. I walked 10 extra blocks to the bodega, where the winking counterman slipped me 50-cent loosies in a brown paper bag.

A proper bodega features a faded awning advertising EBT, hot sandwiches and cold beer. It sells $1 coffee, cheap Honey Buns wrapped in cellophane and Jarritos soda. The guys outside are playing dominoes.

“They’re a little dingy, but in a comforting way,” says Queens native Kate Haubrich, who co-founded Third Rail Beer.

The brewery’s citrusy Bodega Pale Ale has been a hit at local beer festivals, where people get excited just by the name, says Ms. Haubrich. New Yorkers feel great affection for the bodega, and for good reason.

“In a bodega, you won’t be judged,” she says. “I can go to a bodega in my pajamas, looking not cute at all, and it’s fine. If I go to the deli, maybe I should put my mascara on first.”

Perhaps this view is outdated.

“Before, when you say ‘bodega,’ it was a place of crime, not everything legitimate,” says Zulay Mateo, executive director of the Bodega Association of the United States. “We have worked very hard in the last decade or so to associate the name bodega with community and a positive family image.”

With wealthier people moving to bodega-heavy neighborhoods, the stores are offering more upscale brands, she says. “It’s more mainstream than it used to be.”

I’m not sure I like this trend. So I was delighted to visit Bodega Pizza in Washington Heights, with its hard-core retro-bodega theme.

Co-founder Jose Morales, who grew up in the neighborhood working in his father’s bodega, remembers corner stores where everyone gathered to drink and play the Dominican lottery. Between paychecks, families bought groceries on credit, running a tab recorded on the back on a cigarette carton.

“I wanted to pay homage to the New York I grew up in,” he says.


The facade of his pizzeria, which opened this summer with partner Angely Herrera, is a yellow metal awning featuring a traditional bodega’s red lettering and flashing bulbs.

The front windows are stacked with green tins of Keebler Export Sodas Crackers, pillar candles and faded Brillo boxes. “Hispanic households do a lot of unnecessary cleaning,” Mr. Morales says.

Inside, there’s a quarter-fed arcade game featuring Pac-Man, Centipede and Donkey Kong. Not to mention a graffiti-covered restroom.

While Mr. Morales’s pizzas are selling well, some older folks in the neighborhood get confused and try to buy the detergent in the window.

Mr. Morales, an agreeable man, says he’ll soon offer groceries along with the pizza. “You can eat a nice pie, have a beer and go home with some soap, cereal and toilet paper,” he says.

As for all the newcomers hopping on the bodega bandwagon?

“Just do your homework,” Mr. Morales says. “If you know the history of it, more power to you.”

Group funded by top hotel-trades union helped devise lobbying effort to curb home-share services

City Councilwoman Helen Rosenthal, center, joined opponents of Airbnb at a rally outside City Hall in January. ENLARGE
City Councilwoman Helen Rosenthal, center, joined opponents of Airbnb at a rally outside City Hall in January. 

A political organization funded by a top hotel-trades union has helped develop a multifaceted lobbying effort to persuade New York City politicians to curtail Airbnb, according to emails and records reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

The group known as Share Better has written talking points and op-eds for City Council members, arranged meetings and suggested new rules for home-share services. The president of the 32,000-member New York Hotel Trades Council, which has funded Share Better, has met with Mayor Bill de Blasio at least four times, the documents show.

Unite Here, another hotel union close to Mr. de Blasio that opposes Airbnb, has given $400,000 to the Campaign for One New York, a now-defunct political organization whose activities have drawn state and federal investigations.


Mr. de Blasio has proven a willing ally. He hired employees for a special unit to go after illegal apartment-share listings and promised last November to spend about $10 million on enforcement over the next three years. Manhattan City Councilman Helen Rosenthal has proposed a bill that would raise the fines on illegal listings. Share Better is pushing for even more enforcement.

A spokesman for Mr. de Blasio said it was important to take on “bad actors who take apartments off the market by way of illegal hotels” and that the mayor was proud to spend more on enforcement.

Airbnb declined to comment for this article.

‘I think the anti-Airbnb forces waited too long, and the Airbnb message is already in the marketplace. Now the hotel industry is on the defensive, and New York City is going to be one of the last places to settle this.’
—Bjorn Hanson, professor at New York University
Bjorn Hanson, a professor at New York University who studies the hospitality and travel industry, said Airbnb had been effective at winning over the public and that the hotel industry didn’t “garner as much sympathy.” In places such as Newark and Jersey City, Mr. Hanson said, Airbnb agreed to settlements under which it sent some tax revenues to the local government.

“I think the anti-Airbnb forces waited too long, and the Airbnb message is already in the marketplace,” Mr. Hanson said. “Now the hotel industry is on the defensive, and New York City is going to be one of the last places to settle this.”

The emails reviewed by the Journal suggest that the campaign launched in 2014 against Airbnb has been detailed and comprehensive.

In one 2015 email, Ms. Rosenthal tells a consultant for Metropolitan Public Strategies, a political consulting firm that has worked with Mr. de Blasio, that she doesn’t need to see a final version of an op-ed before he submits it for her.

In an email asking for a meeting with another councilwoman, the firm explains that the issue is important to the hotel trades council. In another case, the firm suggests council members write a letter calling for more aggressive regulation.

For its part, Airbnb hasn’t shied away from spending money to advance its cause. It has hired a consultant with ties to Mr. de Blasio to lobby him, tried to forge a national alliance with SEIU—a union close to the mayor—and lobbied officials in Albany to pass legislation to curb the city’s ability to legislate the service.

The firm has paid Capalino + Co., a firm headed by James Capalino, the city’s top lobbyist and a fundraiser for Mr. de Blasio, more than $200,000 to lobby City Hall.

Much like Uber, the app-driven rider service, and another company seen as disruptive to a traditional New York City industry, Airbnb is popular, digitally savvy and rich. Airbnb says its service helps residents pay their bills.

But many hotels have simply seen Airbnb as unwanted competition. The hotel unions have been buoyed by a 2014 report by Attorney General Eric Schneiderman that shows most of the company’s listings were technically illegal. Airbnb has showed data that says 95% of their listings are legal, but Mr. de Blasio’s office has questioned its reliability.

At a recent board meeting of New York City and Company, the city tourism arm, Mr. de Blasio expressed support for more enforcement when talking to Joseph Spinnato, the president of the Hotel Association of New York City, according to people present. Mr. Spinnato said he thanked Mr. de Blasio for his effort on the issue. “When you talk to de Blasio, you’re preaching to the converted,” said Peter Ward, president of the New York Hotel Trades Council.

Metropolitan Public Strategies has worked on Mr. de Blasio’s affordable-housing push, his efforts on national progressive issues and his 2014 drive to wrest control of the state Senate from Republicans. Neal Kwatra, the firm’s head, was the former political director for the hotel trades council.

Ms. Rosenthal said working with Share Better is a “marriage of opportunity” because they share the same positions. Mr. Ward said elected officials didn’t do the union’s bidding, but that the union helped “shape their opinions.”

“I wish I had the ability to make people in elected government do my bidding,” he said. “I don’t have the ability to make people do my bidding.”",2016-05-10 15:01:11+00:00,d2zz8nx,2,t1_d2zywxc,450,nyc

TL;DR by u/twenafeesh: 

This lasted from 2012 to 2015, and included hacks on at least nine big publishing firms or financial companies, including JP Morgan, Dow Jones, and the Wall Street Journal.

They used the information they gained by monitoring compromised email accounts and accessing confidential information to run pump&amp;dump schemes, illegal gambling rings, credit card fraud, and others, generating hundreds of millions of dollars for their little crime ring.

In the end they apparently compromised more than 75 companies, and used legitimate bank and brokerage accounts, to which they had gained access, to launder money.",2015-11-11 15:28:40+00:00,cwwkf9j,2,t1_cwwjxnu,855,TechNewsToday

Some of those products are really close to the door so I'm sure they have a system in place maybe they have RFID proximity sensors within them that if the item moves away from the tables cameras will focus on them and alert someone. If Microsoft starts reporting lots of theft the local precinct will force them to chain down the products to prevent it being stolen or stop reporting the theft and eat up the cost as it will create a spike in the crime numbers for the area. ,2015-10-27 12:40:58+00:00,cwei5y3,1,t3_3qdmuz,30197,DailyTechNewsShow
