5,"I don't think Jesse intentionally resist the temptation of power and money. Time and time again, he just proves himself incompetent at most of his endeavors. He has a good heart, yes, but at the same time he just doesn't have the temperament to be a top notch man. 

It is ultimately by influence of Walt that he became a top cook, of course along with all the misery that come with it.
