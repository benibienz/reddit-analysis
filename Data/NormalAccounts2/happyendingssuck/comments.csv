Pick a champion that you enjoy playing, and spam that champion. Once you learn the champion well and learn how to farm well, you can start focusing on macro level stuff like wave management. Contrary to popular beliefs, you do not have th have godly mechanics as a mid lanes assassin and be like Faker Senpai to carry. You can easily carry from any role as long as you understand your role in the game well enough. All the stream watching in the world won't help you if you don't apply the things you learn in the stream. I would recommend recording some of your games, bad and good, and see where you tripped up, and what you could have done better.

The number one thing I would recommend is to not get cocky, however, because as soon as you get cocky and start thinking you're better than everyone else, you stop looking to improve, and your rank stagnates or you can even drop. Always look to your mistakes, don't use your teammates as an excuse.

92,"Stop blaming it on your adc. Try shotcalling more, but don't bash teammates for what they're doing, as they're less likely to respond well that way. I.e instead of saying ""Nasus stop splitting top, you aren't getting anything done"" say ""Nasus we need you mid to help us push/teamfight."". 

If you can get a duo who is a good adc do that. It'll make your life easier. 

Don't waste as much money as you are on buying wards. I have a feeling you're just buying wards at random and putting them in not very meaningful positions. Reasoning being I've never seen a low silver player do anything besides warding at random. Also, map awareness on silver sucks. Pants are dragon just released a new guide about warding, You should check that out.

Of course it's possible getting out of silver playing thresh, I have multiple friends who have done that, although you might want to learn a couple of other supports that might fit a certain comp more.

A ranked team is not going to be easier to get rewards in, unless you guys really can get together often to spam ranked 3's or 5's.

100,"I'm only gold 2 but I'm a top lane main. If you already beat your opponents in lane, you have two options:

1. Take the tower and go roam to help other lanes, this can be mid or it can be bot. If you do this early, try to help take drag or something. Don't be afraid to leave, just make sure to come back every once in a while to top lane to make sure ur staying ahead in exp and farm. It's always good to help out your team.

2. If your team is doing fine, or even sometimes if they aren't, win lane and learn how to freeze. Freeze the lane and zone your opponent. Once I played irelia I was vs garen and he had 50 cs at 30 minutes because I didn't allow him to farm. What this does is it makes the other top laner useless, and in great scenarios, it pulls the jungler top, since that is the only way they can break the freeze. This gives your other teammates room to get objectives earlier. Also, if you are really ahead, you can probably just straight up 1v2, especially as Irelia or rumble. If the enemy top laner leaves, push, damage tower some, leave it up if you want to keep on denying or take it and push tier two and start taking the enemy jungle. Don't stay in their jungle too long though unless you are confident on your ability to 1v2 or 3, or if you know their mid laner isn't Gonna be there.",2015-07-31 04:17:11+00:00,ctmfn53,1.0,t3_3f6v2x,35641.0,summonerschool
