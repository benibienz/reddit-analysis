180,Growing up we all knew that when our mom would say she's 'heading out the door' or is 'on her way' (pre cell phone era) she is actually far from it. On multiple occasions I witnessed her saying these things to people on the phone as she was making coffee or something. We all grew up to be very punctual because we know what it is like to be on the receiving end.,2016-06-01 11:28:08+00:00,d3rl62q,5.0,t1_d3redfd,21583.0,AskReddit
181,"I want my friend to see this. I'm the kind of person who is not late. Ever. My friend is the opposite. I once came to pick her up and when I texted that I was there, she texted me to come in as she still had to take a shower and get ready. I now set times for her at least a half an hour earlier to avoid being late. I'm used to it now and I no longer get anxious about it- However, when it involves us being late to meet someone *else* I get a little angry. My brother and his GF once waited nearly an hour at a restaurant for us- We were late because despite the warning alarms I set for her (Yes, I set alarms) and talked to her about meant nothing to her. I had one alarm set for when we need to be in the checkout, and one set for the time that we need to be heading out in order to get there on time. I even gave verbal warnings about how the alarm for one will be going off in 5 min, etc. After the second alarm I basically had to push her to the checkout. My brother was pissed about our tardiness, and is still disgruntled about it to this day. I guess I am too.",2016-06-01 11:14:44+00:00,d3rkvd0,2.0,t1_d3qqdwg,58477.0,AskReddit

Coming here just to ""visit"" your badge is good too! I have never had a stop like this since I had my first drink 10 years ago so visiting my number is motivating. Perhaps it will be for you too :)

292,"I started to be active with exercise again- Yoga, specifically, every morning I could. I joined a place that for new members you can get unlimited classes for a month for only $39. I began to get stronger and develop muscle definition and that helped with my confidence. It's crazy how fast your body responds! My increased self esteem lead to brighter days and evenings began to be no problem because I wanted to feel good for yoga. 

Essentially, I began to put structure back into my days by having a plan for the following day. I kept busy. The days kind of flew by- I was surprised when my counter said 21. The last time I was close to that was a year ago (Spring time always gets me motivated!) Now it is a matter of just keeping on- Having a drink isn't worth resetting my beautiful streak. Instances when I am going to be in a situation where there is alcohol I plan ahead as well. I always have another beverage with me, or if we're out I order one (diet soda or just water with a slice of lime or something.) No one really questions it, and if they do I just say I'm good- craving soda today or something. 
The other day I was at an event in which everyone was drinking either red wine or whiskey. I gotta say it reeked. I was completely turned off. That surprised me too- Delightfully surprised though.
