&gt; 
&gt; The term dry drunk is believed to originate from 12 Step recovery groups. It is used to describe those who no longer drink alcohol but in many ways behave like they were still in the midst of addiction. The dry drunk may be full of resentment and anger. Instead of finding joy in their life away from alcohol, they can act as if they were serving a prison sentence. The only change this person has made is to stop drinking, but in other respects their life remains the same. Friends and family can complain that the dry drunk is almost as hard to be around as they were when drinking. In AA, they describe it as a person that hasnâ€™t touched alcohol in years, but have not yet managed to get sober.

&gt; Our minds are always running, often filled with negativity or worry. Resentment or bitterness about the past, or anxiety regarding the future. That is your brain. You are not your brain. *YOU* are your heart. Your heart holds warmth, security, a sense of calm. It is positive. It is You.
Lay on your back and place your left hand on your heart, and then place your right hand on your belly. As you rest, imagine a white light emitting from your heart. Take a slow breathe in and out... As you breathe in, see how the light brightens and expands throughout your body. To your arms, your legs, your mind... Let the light from your heart rise up, greet, and hold your thoughts. Let the light envelope your mind. As you breathe out, feel the light return to a baseline. Continue to breathe, picturing this natural pulse in your body. Continue to do so for as long as you need. 

This can be done anytime, anywhere. Take a moment to focus on your breath, and visualize your light as it provides comfort to your mind.
