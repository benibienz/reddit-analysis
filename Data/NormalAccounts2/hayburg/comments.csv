2,"Even more dramatically, the president is supposed to represent the interests of the United States and the current electoral system ensures that only voters in the swing states have their needs considered during the election. Even rural states are completely ignored if their vote is predetermined by demographics and the state of the economy. That's the real issue that needs to be corrected. Hundreds of millions of dollar are donated and spent by the campaigns, 96% of that money was spent in 12 states. ",2016-11-15 01:36:36+00:00,da0nx1h,,t1_d9tiqeu,,NeutralPolitics
3,"In the constitution and in Hamilton's [Federalist Paper #68](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed68.asp), it says the intention of the electoral college is to prevent uninformed voters from determining the president out of populism. The intention was not to give any certain states any more power than another in order to correct some perceived imbalance. Now, the entire election happens in 12 states. Hundreds of million dollars are spent in just those 12 states and the needs of the people in those 12 states are the only things the candidates are concerned with. This is a consequence of the winner-take-all system of allocating their electors, which all the states (besides maine and nebraska) adopted over the course of the 1800s. The battleground states are arbitrary determined each election by demographics and the state of the economy. Those things change fairly slowly so the swing states tend to be nearly the same each election, always maintaining their dominance over the outcome of the election. They were not rationally determined to deserve more say in who becomes president than any other state. In my opinion, we either make it equal so that individuals get one vote that matters equally no matter where they live, or we come up with a rational justification for why some states deserve more say and adjust the balance of power so that it doesn't fully lie with solely 12 states that weren't rationally chosen.

In 2000, Florida did just that, overruled the will of the people of the country. If Hillary wins Michigan (which she probably won't, but it's not called yet), then in 2016, Florida did just that, again overruled the will of the people of the country. The way the system is *currently* set up allows for one swing state to override the will of the *people* in those other 49 states.

How do you decide which state has that power? How do you decide which individuals have more power because of the state that they live in? Those individuals are not just making a decision that determines a government that works for them, like you said.  When you're voting for the president, we're trying to form a government that works for all of us.  Hence, it is fair that every person deserves an equal say. If you decide that individuals in some states should have more power, then how do you determine which states? Because right now, it's the arbitrary states that happen to be swing states based on demographics and economics as opposed to anything rational.

When you vote for president to represent your country, should everyone get one vote?

Yes, we have a lot of tiers of government that have control over various subsets of the people for that great reason.  However for each of the those tiers, everyone affected by that vote gets exactly one vote, except when we vote for the president. The president is someone who represents all of us and no matter what state you move to, they will be your president.

&gt;reacting emotionally to one very unfortunate situation without considering it in context with all the other benefits conveyed by the current model.

The current model was not a rational distribution of power. The power being held in the swing states is a consequence of winner-take-all being adopted by some states wanting more individual power in the 1800s while most other states were still assigning electors proportionally. It doesn't inherently favor any political party; it just happens to have overruled democrats twice in recent memory. The current system introduces an element of randomization when there is a close election (1 out of every 6 non-landside elections in fact).  When that randomization doesn't make a difference too often and happens to help you twice in recent memory, you don't see a reason to change it.  However, to be a fair and rational system, it must be changed.",2016-11-14 16:58:30+00:00,d9zzfa4,4.0,t1_d9zyl1t,1058.0,wikipedia

Swing states are effectively randomly chosen each election by demographics and the economic state of the country. Those things change fairly slowly so they tend to be the same states each year. Those are the only states that will have any say in the election and they get an overwhelming share of the attention and money (96% of the hundreds of millions of dollars goes to 12 states). Solidly red states have just as little power in this system as solidly blue states and if they thought about it rationally, they would see that it's just a matter of time before they have their will overruled by the randomness that is inherent in the system. Just because it happens to have benefitted republicans twice in recent memory does not mean it inherently benefits them. It should be straightforward to convince them if the people in their state start insisting that they implement a fair system. It can be changed by a simple law implemented at the state level.

&gt;In fact, the only reason high population dense areas can exist in the first place is because of rural areas like farms.

&gt;In my opinion, the electoral college did it's job this year. It made sure smaller states were heard, but it still took a lot of them to overcome the voting power of the larger states.

Smaller states were not considered by the candidates.  There were no campaign events in Wyoming even though they have most electoral power per person.  There are no campaign events in any small states that aren't swing states.  The electoral college applied a random distribution of power that happened to agree with the choice of the small states.

When you look at county maps like you showed in Minnesota and say that the blue and red areas on the map should match then you're effectively saying people that own more land should have more say. You're saying ""California would have significantly more voting power than other states."" However, why shouldn't every person get one vote to determine the person that represents all of us?

The magnetic button wouldn't work on my cardboard viewer.  Tapping the screen allowed me to move, but not using my button.  Not sure if that's something specific with my viewer or more general.

If there has to be a pop-up ad, it should come up before showing anything else and before going into VR mode.  Then I wouldn't put it in my viewer and then have to take it out to close the ad.

When I walk into a wall and move along it, I can kind of see through it in flashes.  If you can make the threshold where you run into the wall a bit farther away from the wall, then the camera wouldn't partially pass into the wall.  Effectively, you can make an invisible wall a bit offset from the visible wall to prevent the camera from moving into the real wall.
