I'm working on a custom computer for a CubeSat and I have a list of specifications, but I'm not sure who to go to that could do custom electronics solutions like that.  Any ideas or information about who to talk to would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!

Specs:

-RAID 1 controller for 2 SATA SSDs (at least 3 Gbps, 6 would be nice)

-Multiple serial outputs/inputs (at least two RS422)

-ethernet

-usb

-low power usage processor (less than 6W max)

-ideally PC104 form factor (or smaller)",AskElectronics,"Where should I start for a custom computer for a CubeSat?

I'm helping to design an S-band Cassegrain antenna and I have a few questions. First of all, can [a patch antenna like this one](https://www.clyde.space/products/13-cput-sband-patch-antenna) be used as the feed.  The antenna would only be used for receiving transmissions so the beam width of the patch itself shouldn't matter right?

Assuming you can, does it have to be placed at the focal point like in the second schematic in the album or can it be moved lower like in the first schematic.  As long as the reflected rays still hit the patch antenna, it should be fine right?  Would each of the rays be out of phase?  I'm not sure if the path lengths are all the same unless the feed is at the focal point.
