2,"The most common foot officier's weapon during the 18th century was a spontoon, basically a fancy spear or halberd used for self defense and to make the officer visible. You can see a number in this painting here: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/The_Battle_of_Fontenoy.jpg

As was mentioned, officers could purchase and carry fusils instead if they wanted to. The main issue is that officers armed with shoulder firearms or pistols were typically given specific orders not to fire their weapons. In combat a sergeant was expected to give his full attention to commanding and keeping his men in line, which he couldn't do while aiming or reloading a musket.

Nonetheless, the second half of the 18th century started to see more and more officers preferring a fusil over a spontoon or just a sword, particularly among the British. It seems that their experiences in the Americas taught them to prefer having an actual musket to fire in a pinch, even if they didn't use it very often. Ironically, during the War of Independence American officers were using the spontoon more and the fusil less often than British officers did.",2016-11-21 02:54:37+00:00,da90np9,3.0,t1_da8zdtm,1793.0,history

4,"He's a fun source since he almost reads like a modern day internet commentator right down to the ""Here is my ranking for the top 10 weapons ever, you won't believe what isn't number 1!"". He also writes about weapons in very broad terms like above, where where he claims that the half-pike, glaive, and short staff all work in more or less the same way, making his claims pretty easy to generalize. However is actual explanations tend to be pretty vague and hard to understand, and given his clear biases, there isn't necessarily a guarantee that he actually knows what he's talking about.

He doesn't seem to be completely alone on his rapier opinion though, at least as a battlefield weapon. William Garrard (1587) mentioned that the rapier as an important sidearm for infantry (though elsewhere he just says ""sword""), however Humfrey Barwick (1592) and Robert Barret (1598) both felt that a 3 foot short sword like Silver's is ideal for soldiers. Barwick even specified that the sword should have ""no hilt but a cross only"" and wrote that the ""long sword"" should not be used by either cavalry or infantry.",2016-11-20 23:24:37+00:00,da8s4kl,3.0,t1_da8pt3c,3159.0,AskHistorians

It is interesting though that he claims the halberd is only 5 or 6 feet long. Many halberds were [quite a bit longer than that](http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/26665) especially with the long spike on top, so it might be that he's referring to something more on par with a knight's poleaxe.

He does mention some kind of weapon 8 or 9 feet long with a complex head called the ""Welsh hook or forest bill"". This polearm ""has advantage against all manner of weapons whatsoever.""

Edit: It's worth remembering that this is when discussing weapons for one on one combat or personal defense. For massed combat he claims that the much longer morris pike defends better than weapons of the perfect length, while shorter, weightier weapons like the battle axe ""do much more offend the enemy, &amp; are then much better weapons, than is the short staff, the long staff, or the forest bill.""",2016-11-20 21:53:39+00:00,da8o4t7,4.0,t1_da8kgx4,4651.0,AskHistorians

At Malplaquet (1709), for example, the best evidence indicates that 2/3 of the wounds received by French troops came from the enemy's fusils, with only about 2 % were inflicted by bayonets. Of the men wounded by gunfire, 60 % had been struck in the left side, the side facing the enemy as a soldier stood in line to fire himself."" (Lynn - ""Giant of the Grand Siecle"" p 489) 

This seems more or less backed up by books I've read. Cavalry would get relatively more use out of their saber when charging other cavalry, but for the infantry actual bayonet melees tended to be extremely rare. The bayonet charge was a commonly used and often decisive tactic, but most of the time the effect was largely psychological.

Knights would typically fight on horseback with a lance, but when the situation required it they would dismount and arm themselves with shortened lances or other polearms. Whether the weapons for each period are correct as well as wether the armors used are actually suited for fighting on foot I'll have to leave to someone else's judgment. English knights from the 100 years war for example generally preferred to fight on foot and as a result their armor designs changed to become more flexible and provide greater range of movement when swinging poleaxes. Italian cavalry armor on the other hand tended to include more overlapping plates which made it more restrictive but provided greater protection from a charging lance.",2016-11-19 02:00:28+00:00,da6hnrt,2.0,t1_da5jriw,49406.0,badhistory
11,"Elizabethan writers seemed to consider it a matter of practicality. Pikemen needed to be able to afford good armor and needed to be fairly tall, strong men while firearms were more suited for smaller, more nimble men. And even though many noted that firearms tended to cause most of the casualties they still considered pike squares to be the ""strength"" of the army, since they were the only thing that could resist a charge by cavalry or other pikemen.

Foot officers were also generally expected to use primarily polearms all the way up through the 18th century due to the fact that firing a musket was considered to destract them from their command duties.

Humfrey Barwick began his career as a common foot arquebusier and slowly worked his way up to captain as a mercenary. And though he had a very high opinion of firearms he still considered weapons like the pike, halberd, and pistol to be more suited for those of noble birth.

It's possible some noblemen might have preferred to become a foot musketeer, or more likely a dragoon or mounted arquebusier (although, even these seem to be more often created by taking footsoldiers and teaching them how to ride relatively small, cheap horses), but if a man was wealthy enough to actually afford good armor and a good horse, as well as an assistant to help with his equipment, he was probably more suited to be heavy cavalry.",2016-11-18 23:39:49+00:00,da6cl0v,4.0,t1_da5sua6,25950.0,badhistory

18,"If you're asking about heavy lancers in general then at this time they weren't quite extinct yet in western Europe, though they were largely on their way out. John Cruso's *Militarie Instructions for the Cavallrie* still included instructions for the training and use of [heavy lancers](http://imgur.com/a/EHbVc) in 1632.

There was a continuing debate over lancers vs reiters/cuirassiers, but overall the lance seems to have been losing. Though Gustavus Adolphus was credited with discovering during the 30 years war that his reiters could defeat polish hussars if he ordered them to charge aggressively and hold off their pistol fire until melee, yet Francois de la Noue was making pretty much the same argument as early as the 1580s. He pointed out that lance charges rarely killed anyone in pistol-proof armor and could at best injure the horses, while the reiters with their pistols at the ready were far more effective in the melee: ""the Reiters are never so daungerous as when they be mingled with the enemy, for then be they all fire."" He pointed that because of the danger of pistols cavalry clashes rarely lasted for a few moments before one side broke, thus good discipline would have been more important than the psychological impact of the lances. In 1632, John Cruso wrote that the main reason so few lances were being employed was that there were so few remaining actually trained in their use. Using the lance required a huge amount of training for both the rider and the horse, especially when talking about the massive, 18 foot lances needed to be effective against infantry armed with pikes. In addition, the lancer needed to be trained how to use his sword, pistols, and lance, while the cuirassier only needed to learn to use his sword and pistols. Cruso also pointed out that Lancers were less flexible, could only attack in a straight line, and were only effective on hard, open ground. 

Essentially, a lancer required a significant amount of extra training, and provided a questionable amount of extra utility. I'm not an expert on the Polish Hussars, but essentially it seems to be a case where the Polish lance tradition was able to survive much better than it did in western Europe.

Something definitely went wrong for the Chinese during the First Opium War, but the majority of British troops were still armed with smooth-bore muskets, not rifles and breach loading cannons. Andrade mentions Robbins' ""Ballistic Revolution"" as one way china's military technology was behind the west at the time, little while back though I found a JSTOR article titled ""China and Western Technology in the Late Eighteenth Century"" by Joanna Waley-Cohen which claims that in 1774 a Jesuit scholar discovered mistakes in the mortar tables used by the Qing military. The priest was sent by the emperor to assist the army which was besieging rebel fortresses, and after the corrections were made they were able to shoot much more accurately. Given the timeframe, I wonder if this priest's ""discovery"" came about because he acquired a copy of Benjamin Robins' work? Anyways, that might be something for another thread.

Our best evidence for the use of extremely powerful bows by English archers comes from the bows recovered from the Mary Rose, a warship that sunk almost a century after the hundred years war ended. In addition, many of the laws we know about related to English archery also date to the Tudor period, including laws requiring archery practice once a week and regulations passed to ensure that good quality yew bowstaves were widely available at affordable prices. There is some evidence that the quality of English archers may have declined over this period, but it seems to have been a fairly slow process overall up until longbows were largely supplanted by firearms towards the end of the century.

41,"Thanks, as I understand it sanitized fabric inside a wound won't cause issues, but an early modern soldier's clothing generally was not very clean. There was no understanding of germ theory back then but surgeons still generally focused on removing as much foreign material as they could, including the bullet, fabric, and anything else they could find. I was thinking it might be that wearing extra layers of clothing was discouraged in order to make this easier, although I suppose it wasn't discouraged enough to make musketeers fight shirtless.

One of the tests from the [Graz experiments](https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/MCR/article/view/17669/22312) found that placing a mild steel plate in front of the target drastically reduced the size of the wound cavity, (from 369 cm^3 to only 25 cm^3) so armor may have improved survivability in that sense, but it had the downside of leaving metal splinters deep inside the wound. However an authentic, pistol-proof horse's breastplate was also tested and reportedly caused much less splintering than the modern steel did. So it may have also depended on quality.

I came across an article titled [A Detailed Study of the Effectiveness and Capabilities of 18th Century Musketry on the Battlefield](http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/44838/1/44838.pdf) (pdf) which involved testing a simulated Brown Bess musket against gelatin blocks with various materials like wool or a scottish targe in front of them and noted a lot of material deposited in the wound, but didn't test buff leather and didn't test whether more layers of fabric resulted in more material left in the wound. They did decide to test a modern CBA vest against the Brown Bess though which is pretty neat.

It might be that you're right, Garrard seemed to be under the impression that stamina and agility were the most important things for an arquebusier and there is presumably some reason he still recommended padded jacks for archers but not for gunmen.

52,"For what it's worth, Andrade's overall thesis is that the development and adoption of gunpowder technology in china isn't entirely linear. He argues that east Asia overall was slightly behind in military technology in 1500, caught back up during the 16th and 17th century, particularly during the large scale conflict between the Ming and Qing, then fell behind again sometime prior to the first opium war.

Wheelocks I think are an interesting aspect which isn't discussed by Andrade and rarely at all in discussions about firearms outside of europe. Aside from perhaps one sentence along the lines of ""They knew wheelocks existed but decided they were too expensive/too complex and didn't bother."" Wheelocks were very expensive, delicate, and probably even more complex than flintlocks were. Yet as Bert Hall points out there were apparently enough wheelocks in Europe to completely revoultionize European cavalry warfare in the second half of the 16th century. By 1600 most cavalry were supposed to carry two or three wheelocks and even lancers were now expected to carry a pistol or two, and all these weapons would have required constant repairs and replacement. All this seems to suggest the development of an extremely large and advanced wheelock industry in Europe completely unlike anything elsewhere.",2016-11-08 21:29:08+00:00,d9ro883,5.0,t1_d9rkdd8,4413.0,AskHistorians
53,"According to Andrade, discoveries by Chinese archeologists might put some dates back a bit earlier. For instance, while the oldest dated surviving chinese gun comes from the end of 13th century, another 108 kg bronze gun along with a round iron ball were discovered which contextually date to sometime in the early 13th century. In either case it is interesting that the earliest hard evidence for Chinese cannon dates to around the time or slightly before gunpowder arrived in Europe. It is true that as early as the end of the 14th century Europe had a significant advantage in the use of large siege guns designed to batter down walls, however Andrade claims had a significant advantage in the use of smaller guns, with up to 10% of early Ming troops being armed with firearms, far more than European armies at this time. Intriguingly, he writes that studying examples of Chinese cannon from between 1300 and 1450 shows that they were following a pattern of developing longer bores relative to diameter the same way cannons were developing in Europe at this time. Though of course he argues that this stopped after around 1450.

Andrade also claims there is good evidence that corned gunpowder may have been invented independently in China. Chinese archeologists studying Ming land mines from around 1370 found that they apparently contain corned powder. The article he cites is in Chinese so I can't even understand the title, although it makes sense that landmines would need a reliable powder with ingredients that aren't liable to separate like serpentine powder. I don't know exactly what kind of corned powder was used, maybe it was more of a ""crumbled"" variety rather than made into uniform grains.

He generally focuses on the development of cannon during this period and doesn't say much about the development of the matchlock. Which I find a bit odd, if the Chinese were making a much heavier use of small arms you would expect their small arms technology to develop faster.

If I remember from *Gunpowder and Firearms: Warfare in Medieval India* gunpowder was first introduced to India around the time of Mongols and early guns were likely first introduced through the Ottomans. It is also possible that Ottoman guns reached China earlier than the Portuguese but I don't know that there is evidence for it. In the later 16th century Turkish muskets were definitely in China and Ming sources claim that they were even better than European muskets. According to *Gunpowder and Firearms*, when the Portuguese arrived in India their cannons and small arms were generally superior to the Indians' weapons in some way and had a significant impact on Indian warfare.

56,"Very interesting. It seems like modern adaptations of Shakespeare tend to skim over the swordfights a bit.

I wonder how much validity there was to Silver's arguments. Personally, my only swordfighting experience comes from modern epee fencing, so I find it hard to see how the shorter sword could ever win. However while Silver was certain that a good old English short sword would trounce a foreign rapier in a duel, many of his arguments had to do with which was better in self-defense situations. For instance he argued that a short sword could be drawn more quickly and required less room, and that it would be better at defending blows and thrusts than a rapier. In one of his more interesting anecdotes, an Italian fencing master got in a quarrel and drew his rapier against a waterman, only to be badly beaten by oars and stretchers which he could not defend against.

Some military writers such as William Garrard do specify the rapier as being an important sidearm for soldiers. Though most of them just say ""sword"" without mentioning the type. Humfrey Barwick, who otherwise tends to have a very modernist attitude in his work, writes that footmen should all carry 3-foot short swords, even specifying ""no hilts but crosse onely"". Robert Barret wrote one year after Silver and mentioned arming troops with short swords. He even thought that in a press the most useful weapon might actually be a dagger anyways: ""For who doth not know that if the enemy be like to be victor, the armed pikes will yeeld backward as they feele themselues distressed, so as when the pikes are in such maner crashed and clustred together, that they can no longer charge and push with their pikes, then will the throng or presse in the center be so great, that the halberds and bils shall haue little roome to strike; **nay short swords will hardly haue rome at that instant either to thrust or to strike. I would thinke daggers would do more execution at that time**, and in that presse vntill one side fall to flight.""

The real affect of all this though is that it really screws with D&amp;D-style weapon categorizations, since what most people tend to call ""a medieval longsword"" was to the the Elizabethans ""a shortsword.""",2016-11-08 04:19:25+00:00,d9qn2o9,1.0,t3_5bmy1x,44093.0,EarlyModernEurope

61,"Much of this comes from Tonio Andrade's *The Gunpowder Age*.

Many early Chinese gunpowder recipes burned relatively slowly making them ill suited for propelling a projectile. As a result early gunpowder weapons largely took the form of fire arrows, firebombs, and firelances (a small hollow tube fixed to the end of a pole or spear which would spray fire at the enemy, a bit like a flamethrower). Because Chinese fortifications tended to be thicker  and wider at the base than castle walls in Europe at the time Chinese siege tactics tended to revolve more on attacking the gate or setting the buildings inside on fire rather than battering down walls, and as a result these incendiary weapons continued to play a role in Chinese warfare throughout the middle ages.

Nonetheless your premise is incorrect, the Chinese did eventually develop more explosive recipes for gunpowder and guns before the Europeans did. They were able to make new explosive ""thunderclap""-style bombs as well as early cannons and ""improved fire lances"", which used a metal tube to shoot a round, metal bullet and could be reloaded. For most of the late middle ages up until the second half of the 15th century European and Chinese gun technology seems to have been more or less on par and if anything the Chinese seem to have had the advantage. Over the next fifty years however the matchlock arquebus and the ""classic""-style, long-barreled cannon were developed in Europe. These weapons then remained unknown to China until the technology was brought over by Portuguese explorers in the 1520s. 

Exactly why these weapons were developed in Europe rather than China is not clear. Andrade suggests that it had do with the relative amounts of warfare seen during this period. Essentially, in 1450 the Ming dynasty had finished stabilizing it's rule and with no major military threats there was no longer much need to develop new gun technologies.

I had it extracted by Dr. Parot and put in one of the boxes in the regimental ambulance, intending to keep it as a memento; but unfortunately it got lost.

&gt;You will understand that for such a minor injury I was not going to leave the regiment, particularly at such a critical time…

Why do I get the sense that he's using his ""we don't know what the psychological effect of gunpowder would have been"" statement as a blanket excuse to replace alexander's army with literal zombies who wouldn't flinch no matter how many of them were mowed down? Because that's pretty much the only way I see alexander's troops even remotely standing a chance, and even then that's mainly because Napoleonic tactics weren't optimized to fight mindless zombies, because they don't exist.

People tend to forget that the bayonet charge was still far more of a psycological weapon than muskets were. Throughout the 18th century and napoleonic wars bayonet injuries were still generally extremely rare compared to those from bullets or artillery. Coming into sarissa range of a still-loaded musket would basically suicide, and even if they if they did come close enough the musketeers would just retreat, possibly even in good order because they aren't encumbered by heavy armor, 20 ft poles, or dense formations 16 ranks deep. (As an aside I kind of get the sense that this historian's proposal that the Macedonian infantry would simply form in a massive line two miles long at Waterloo and then march at double time while maintaining cohesion over hedges, ditches, fences ridges, and buildings isn't the most brilliant strategy).

As far as Greek archers, slingers, and javelinmen having greater range and effectiveness than muskets, just no. Don't make me bring up Marbot's opinion of the archers he fought at dresden and leipzig, it wasn't high.

As for ""catapults were basically the same thing as cannon"" lol out loud out laughing.

Pretty much the only thing in Alexander's army I can see being somewhat effective would be his companion cavalry. Lancers were seeing sort of a resurgence in popularity during this period, but at the same time that mostly just shows that they wouldn't have been anything new to the troops at Waterloo.

75,"As far as the English longbow goes, it was officially dropped by the English army in 1595, one of the last nations in western Europe to do so. At the time, many still considered the bow to be their national weapon so the move was fairly controversial and a great deal of military literature was written discussing the relative merits of each weapon. Contrary to many modern claims the majority actually did consider firearms to be better overall, primarily focusing on guns' far superior range and force compared to arrows, the fact that archers get less effective as they grow tired or get insufficient food and rest, or the fact that guns can be more easily used from behind cover/in dense formations.

One of the most damning pamphlets came from an English mercenary named Humfrey Barwick, who originally spent his youth training to be a good shot with a longbow before being given an arquebus when he first joined the army in the mid 1500s. He considered the bow to be a completely inferior weapon in just about every respect: anyone with an arquebus and good powder could shoot a bullet farther and with more force than the strongest archer, the gun is more accurate because it is aimed ""by rule"" while the bow is aimed ""by guess"", he even argued that firearms had a greater overall rate of fire because they could shoot from farther off or shoot multiple projectiles per shot (""A perfect Harquebu∣zere wil discharge more Bullets, be the time short or long, then any Bowman can doo arrowes""). He follows this up by claiming that in his long career as a mercenary he had seen hundreds of men killed by bullets for every one killed outright by arrows or crossbow bolts.

Similar arguments were put forward by well known war veterans such as Barnabe Rich and Sir Roger Williams (the latter of whom called bowmen ""the worst shot used these days"") and in the end the hardliners won out. The declaration that longbows were no longer fit to be weapons of war meant that even the ""moderates"", who agreed firearms were better overall but thought smaller numbers of bowmen might still be effective as light infantry or for shooting over the heads of musketeers and pikemen, were no longer being taken very seriously.

As for armor, during this period pikemen and cavalry still usually wore metal armor and longbowmen were still ordered to wear padded jacks, but arquebusiers and musketeers weren't ordered to wear any armor at all except for a morion. Those who claimed that 500 musketeers would beat 1000 archers in a straight up fight would have been aware of that fact.",2016-11-02 21:04:16+00:00,d9ixolu,1.0,t3_5aqybn,15915.0,AskHistorians

85,"None of that proves military muskets became progressively more accurate over time. The mass produced Brown Bess was designed to maximise reliability and ease of production, not accuracy. And even in the 19th century there were still individuals like Col hanger that most of them weren't bored nearly as well as hunting fowlers or expensive officer's fusils.

&gt; Yes, but presumably there is a reason why this wasn't utilised militarily on a scale smaller than a grapeshot.

There actually are quite a few examples where some soldiers preferred to load their muskets with buckshot or other loads, but the main reason they weren't used that way more often seems to boil down to the fact that a single lead ball is accurate enough and tends to do much more damage than multiple low-energy pellets or multiple low-energy arrows do.

&gt; It does say that there were applications where something else was still preferable to firearms.

ie some noblemen still thought crossbows were ""cool"". No one would say that a crossbow would generally beat an assault rifle one on one today, just because some people still like to hunt with them.

It gets pretty complicated to go over the response of every single culture on the planet (though like the native Americans many of them had a lot more respect for firearms than they are commonly given credit for, or mainly used bows because guns and gunpowder were too expensive or not available in large enough quantities). However the European experience was that firearms were the preferred weapon in pretty much every scenario.",2016-10-29 07:07:09+00:00,d9citw5,9.0,t1_d9chvq5,2989.0,badhistory

87,"&gt; Sporting and hunting muskets are an entirely different class than military muskets

That's a distinction which was very much blurred in the 16th century. Higher quality weapons did make their way into military service and even reloading procedures often weren't standardized yet. Although even a relatively simple gun shooting unpatched balls or square bullets is still generally going to hit what you're aiming at 50 yards out. And again a musket loaded as a shotgun will make it sort of difficult to miss. Many early sporting manuals actually recommend a *minimum* shooting distance of 40 yards so that the bird's corpse isn't mangled too badly.

&gt;For other uses, crossbows were still being made in the 17th century.

They were still occasionally used for sport by the upper classes, although so were boar spears so that doesn't really say much. 

There weren't squads of ""crossbow snipers"" being used by any european military. And they weren't being used by American settlers who needed to hunt for food and defend against native Americans.

""Effective range"" is a really subjective term, and it definitely doesn't do much good to compare some medieval chronicler's definition of term to how it's defined in a Napoleonic era military manual. Most of the 16th century military writers just considered range a no contest in favor of firearms: a musket shot was deadly to unarmored men at 600 yards while few archers could do much with a war arrow beyond 200 yards. Blaise de Monluc fought against english longbowmen around Boulogne in the 1540s and noted that their weapons were ""of very little reach"".

In reality it was understood that anyone with a firearm could shoot a bullet much farther and with more force than any arrow, and archers who could reliably shoot more accurately than the best musketeers seem to have been extremely rare or non-existant (particularly in combat ""easier to aim"" almost always means ""more accurate""). Humphrey Barwick initially spent his childhood learning to be an archer, but wrote that after just 4 months of practice with his first arquebus he could shoot just as accurately as the best archers in England who had been practicing their entire lives. When he first joined the army in the 1540s he claimed that his commander held trials of arms involving bows, crossbows, and firearms two or three times a week which apparently left little doubt that guns were the more accurate weapons. In combat his conclusion was even more damning, estimating that he had seen hundreds killed by firearms for every one killed outright by a bow or crossbow.

It's worth noting that by the end of the century even the ""moderates"", who agreed that firearms were better overall but that archers might still be effective as light infantry or for shooting over the heads of the musketeers and pikemen, were no longer being taken very seriously.",2016-10-28 03:06:59+00:00,d9ay6l7,3.0,t1_d9alabv,18674.0,badhistory

96,"For a very good recent book on the subject I highly recommend *The Gunpowder Age: China, Military Innovation, and the Rise of the West* by Tonio Andrade. He sums up a lot of the information and theories available as far as china goes and concludes that the main cause does seem to be a relative lack of major wars. 

Essentially, Chinese military technology underwent two different divergences compared to Europe. Prior to the mid 15th century Chinese gunpowder technology was on par with or better than that of the west. Chinese cannon was following European ones in the trend of longer barrels relative to bore size and the Ming army employed a larger proportion of handgunners than European armies would up until around 1500. By 1450 however the Ming had achieved a level of relative stability with no major opponents and military development stopped. Meanwhile in Europe over the next half century the ""classic"" cannon was developed and the matchlock arquebus started becoming widespread. As a result when the Portuguese first arrived in the 1520s both sides agreed that European guns and cannon were far superior.

This didn't last though, by the end of the 16th century and over the course of the 17th century warfare picked up again in china and European gun technologies were quickly adapted first by the Ming and later by the Qing as well. China developed complex drills and countermarch-style volley fire techniques even earlier than the Dutch did, and by the end of the 17th century they had defeated two Renaissance-style artillery forts. They even had plans to build their own but once the Qing had firmly established their dominance there was no longer any real need. Thus, Andrade argues, China had again reached a level of relative military parity with Europe. It was then over the course of the 18th century that again a lack of warfare combined with the relatively isolationist policies of the Qing dynasty led to a lack of military innovation and serious decline in the quality of the army leading up to a decisive defeat by the British during the Opium Wars.",2016-10-27 04:15:32+00:00,d99kg01,1.0,t3_5985ok,186142.0,AskHistorians

98,"As for the blunderbuss: Any smoothbore firearm could be turned into a shotgun by putting multiple musket balls, pistol bullets, or hail shot/small shot into the barrel. Early firearms were definitely used this way, although exactly how often isn't entirely clear. Elizabethan writers discussed the concept quite a bit. Humphey Barwick's suggestion for maximizing a musket's rate of fire was to drop more and more bullets into the barrel as the enemy got closer, all the way up to six (although he cautioned that the more lead, the less powder you should use). One of the reasons Roger Williams gave for preferring the large caliber musket over the smaller caliber caliver was that the musket was more effective when firing small shot. John Smythe actually recommended that all musketeers load their weapons with pistol bullets or hail shot and hold their fire until the enemy came into a very short range. The main reason that a single, large caliber musket ball was generally preferred over multi shot loads just seems to be that it had far greater penetration and created a much larger wound cavity.",2016-10-26 23:00:01+00:00,d997j0h,1.0,t3_59jexc,13959.0,WarCollege
99,"If he is a member of a militia he might not need to. While wealthier citizens were generally encouraged to bring their own arms and armor, by this point many towns were collecting military equipment in public arsenals in order to equip soldiers in times of war. However these were still frequently under-supplied and what little equipment they did have was often low quality, old-fashioned, and ill-fitting. 

The most likely scenario is that he wouldn't be wearing any armor at all. While the front ranks of a pike block needed to be well armored and would ideally be comprised of gentlemen who could afford to do so, many pikemen in the rear ranks would be completely unarmored and essentially just there to add more mass to the formation. Arquebusiers and musketeers during this period rarely wore any armor at all aside from sometimes a helmet. For them armor usually wasn't even recommended due to their need to serve as skirmishers and the fact that they already had to carry quite a bit of heavy equipment.

As far as options go if our peasant is dead set on acquiring himself some sort of armor. For the first half of the century padded jacks were extremely popular in the British isles. Jacks continued to be main armor used by English longbowmen and in Scotland even many noblemen reportedly preferred to wear thick jacks with a small wooden targe strapped to their left arm instead of a metal cuirass. Mail and brigandine armors were still present during this period, however they were being increasingly seen as old fashioned and not nearly as protective as plate armor. So it might be possible to acquire a used suit for relatively cheap. The most common armor during the period were low-quality, mass-produced munition breastplates and helmets. In times of warit might be possible to acquire equipment that had been looted from soldiers either killed in battle or by disease. Or equipment might be purchased from deserters or simply from soldiers who were tired of carrying it around and wanted a bit of extra pocket change (at various times the English army tended to have a problem with large amounts of equipment that went ""missing"").

101,"This sub occasionally gets questions like this along the lines of ""why did Asian armies do this while European armies did this"", however I've noticed that they tend to rarely get satisfactory answers if they get answered at all. This might be due to the fact that there aren't many people who are experts in both medieval European and medieval Chinese warfare. Generally fully understanding how warfare and weapons developed in just one region for just one period of time tends to be a full time job.

For swords, the simple explanations like ""one was better against armored vs unarmored"" or ""one was better from horseback"" seem to have too many counter-examples to take at face value. Knights of course often fought from horseback and there were many periods where straight swords were used against mostly unarmored enemies. Similarly there are definitely examples of asian soldiers who fought with curved swords against armored opponents on foot. While the curved saber started to become more popular in Europe once cavalry stopped wearing armor it was hardly universal and the thrust vs. cut continued to be debated by scholars well into the 19th century. If you could somehow develop a complete knowledge of warfare during all these periods and then perform a statistical analysis of the victories of the straight sword compared to the curved sword then maybe in theory you could figure out which was really more effective in which situation, but that probably isn't going to happen.

In addition, curved vs straight is just the tip of the iceberg. You'd also need to dive into why some peoples preferred swords with very pronounced curves while some preferred swords that only had shallow curves, why some swords had the center of mass right at the handle while others had the center of mass further down the blade, why some swords had a cross section that looked like this while other swords had a cross section that looked like that, etc.

Again there likely isn't a very good answer to your question. It may be that choice between straight vs curved blades often did just boil down to culture, tradition, or personal preference. Most sword designs are at their heart a compromise of some sort between various features. However a strong cut from a knight's longsword is still going to make someone pretty dead, as is a thrust from a katana.

This might seem rash, but it worked surprisingly often, e.g. at the battle of Mont Gisard, where King Balduin and Reynald de Chatillon defeated Saladin. A possible explanation is that this allowed the Latins to take their enemies by surprise.

Coordinating a large number of cavalry to simultaneously turn and retreat on a dime can be fairly difficult even in the best of circumstances. In Europe once ranged cavalry finally became popular due to the invention of the pistol they still never fully got the hang of the technique. Sir Roger Williams complained that if a hundred reiters discharged their pistols from 100 or even 160 yards away they often still wouldn't have time to finish turning around before the heavy lancers smashed into them. The problem wasn't really solved until the reiters were simply trained to charge home and fight with their swords.",2016-10-18 05:34:44+00:00,d8wv7y2,2.0,t1_d8w8eyd,32450.0,AskHistorians
107,"Pike and shot doesn't really refer to any single tactic, rather it refers to a wide variety of different tactics used to achieve a close coordination of mobile pike blocks with troops armed with firearms from around the Italian Wars to the end of the 17th century. Both pikes and missile weapons certainly did exist before this period, and many of the tactics did take inspiration from the past. Famously, Maurice of Nassau based his formations on the Ancient Roman Triplex Acies, and his method of volley fire was inspired by a description of Roman countermarch techniques. In china a similar method of countermarching volley fire had been used with crossbows for over a thousand years. In general though, formations in the pike and shot era looked pretty different compared to those of the past, especially by the 17th century.

The dominant feature of infantry tactics for most of the 16th century, the ""great square"" of aggressive, disciplined pikemen, gained popularity sometime in the 1400s. The matchlock mechanism was also developed sometime in the 1400s but there wasn't much of a relationship initially. At the start of the Italian wars shot still played a fairly minor role and among Swiss and landsknecht infantry they were still outnumbered by pikes by about 10 to 1. Their purpose was mainly just to form a skirmish line in front of the pike block in order to screen it's advance. While most of the shot used firearms at this point in practice it might be a mix of light infantry weapons including arquebuses, old-fashioned handgonnes, bows, crossbows, even slings and javelins. Over the course of the Italian Wars and the rest of the 16th century as firearms proved how powerful they were they steadily formed a larger and larger proportion of the total infantry until they equaled or even outnumbered the pikes. Since firearms are most effective at close range and only the first couple of ranks can fire at once this was where military thinkers needed to start dreaming up creative ways for musketeers to maximize their fire while still working closely with a pike square.

The most significant attempt to incorporate traditional ranged weapons into pike and shot tactics seems to have come from the English. England was relatively slow to modernize and didn't start employing significant numbers of arquebusiers until around the 1540s. As firearms became more common they quickly replaced bowmen at the front and wings of the formation and archers were moved to the rear of the pikemen where they could shoot over the heads of the troops in front of them. In practice this doesn't seem to have been very effective though. Sir John Smythe blamed it on the fact that longbowmen still needed to see their targets to shoot accurately, and this was not possible with such a huge mass of men in the way, especially when the view is further obscured by gunsmoke and a forest of pikes.

116,"Thanks. It sounds like there's quite a bit of evidence for experiments with various methods of volley fire prior to the end of the 16th century. It seems like there may have been advantages and disadvantages to each type, for instance the method of dividing the line into columns 4 or 5 across would have meant a more dense formation overall, but longer reloads since the soldiers have to travel farther to reach the rear.

I wonder if methods of rotating fire would have been figured out more quickly on a smaller scale. For instance napoleonic skirmishers sometimes mentioned working in pairs, with the second man not shooting until the first man is mostly finished reloading so that at least one gun is always at the ready. Maybe experienced soldiers in the 16th century would have also figured out to work in pairs or small groups while skirmishing prior to company wide volley drills being invented. Similarly during sieges, if 8 men with matchlocks are defending a tower that only has 2 gun loops facing the enemy, then they aren't going to be very effective if they don't figure out how to take turns shooting. This is mostly speculation, but it seems that small groups of harquebusiers pretty early on became known for being very effective at defending fortifications or at fighting behind ditches, hedges, or rough terrain. Whether against infantry or cavalry.

Interestingly, the New England colonies originally brought over large numbers of polearms but seems to have quickly decided that they were not much use in the terrain and against the Native Americans' fighting style. They started relying almost entirely on firearms in combat and the Indians started working to acquire firearms as well. Basically polearms seem to have been considered obsolete in North America almost a century before they stopped playing a major role in European armies.

I read *Tactics and the Face of Battle*, very interesting. I like his explanation of tactics evolving around controlling or creating mass panic. The square vs line thing is something that has often confused me, since if the soldiers on both sides were robots then the line would theoretically always surround the square and cause more casualties. Overall though it seems to further highlight the difficulty of organizing and commanding massive numbers of soldiers. I have doubts about the claim that bows had a greater range/accuracy than firearms though and that might be a topic for another thread, but I wonder how much the puzzle of figuring out where to position missile troops actually changed from before firearms were introduced.",2016-10-10 21:39:44+00:00,d8mg38t,,t1_d8bzj4q,,EarlyModernEurope

To quote English veteran Sir Roger Williams, ""I persuade my self five hundred musketeers are more serviceable than fifteen hundred bow-men.""

@ /u/otblock57, it was firearms that had a far greater range than bows did. Just because tactics changed to favor preserving the shock of the initial volley until the enemy came extremely close doesn't mean that long range harassment with guns wasn't possible. This tactic was used to great effect by the Japanese during their invasion of korea, where minister Yu Songyong repeatedly mentions instances where japanese musketeers were inflicting casualties on korean soldiers while all the korean arrows shot back fell short. William Muller, author of *Elements of the Science of War* (1811) clarified that while normally fire was to preserved until the enemy was no farther than 200 paces and ideally within 50 paces, if an enemy battalion did ever open fire from 300 or 400 paces away then you should still shoot back.

In combat the flatter trajectory and ease of aiming gave the musket a much better practical accuracy than bows and crossbows, which required constantly making guesses about range, crosswinds, and other factors while under the extreme stress of being shot at. Generally bowmen or crossbowmen wouldn't be aiming at specific targets beyond 50 yards either, beyond that it would just be zone shooting. Larger caliber musket balls were also far more likely to incapacitate than arrows when they hit or pass through two or more people, especially at ranges less than 150 yards.

Firearms were extremely effective when used from natural cover or fortifications, far more so than bows. Guns' effectiveness while skirmishing or use in seiges was quickly identified as one of their greatest strengths, "". . . euery Bushe, euery Hedge, euery Ditch, euery Tree, and lamost euery Moalhil is a sufficient safgarde for a shotte, where the Archer is little worse, but on a playne.""

The second quote is from an English surgeon about the Boston rebels in 1777. ""Their muskets were charged with old nails and angular pieces of iron, and from most of the men being wounded in the legs, I am inclined to believe it was their design, not wishing to kill the men, but to leave them as burdens on us, to exhaust the provisions, as well as to intimidate the rest of the soldiery.""",2016-09-28 23:23:25+00:00,d867kgb,3.0,t1_d8659th,3524.0,AskHistorians
138,"I have an interesting one.

Today the use of bullets specifically designed to cause extra damage to human flesh is considered a war crime. And while a soft, lead musket ball practically classifies for that on its own it appears that some some soldiers still didn't think their bullets were hurting the enemy enough. This lead to multiple varieties of mutilated shot including bullets hammered into cylinders or other shapes in order to make them tumble upon impact and cause larger wounds as well as bullets with nails or other bits of sharp metal hammered into them. Possibly one of the most brutal were bullets cut into 2 or 4 conjoined sections which would split apart upon impact.

In 1777 General Howe wrote this to Washington, “My aid-de-camp will present to you a ball cut and fixed to the end of a nail, taken 
from a number of the same kind, found in the encampment quitted by your troops on the 15th inst. I do not make any comment upon such 
unwarrantable and malicious practices, being well assured that the contrivance has not come to your knowledge.”

And to his credit Washington responded, “Your aid-de-camp delivered to me the ball you mention, which was the first of the kind I ever 
saw or heard of. You may depend the contrivance is highly abhorred by me and every measure shall be taken to prevent so wicked and infamous a 
practice being adopted in this Army.”

The second reason is that the slower rate of fire was seen as a good thing while in combat. Volley fire doesn't improve the mechanical accuracy of the musket at all (in fact, troops told to fire at a paper target generally did worse when firing volleys than when told to fire ""as skirmishers""). However in combat, when soldiers are stressed and firing as fast as they can, it was observed that troops frequently forgot steps when loading their guns (accidentally shooting with the ramrod still in the barrel was a common occurrence) and many didn't even take the time to fully level their barrels before pulling the trigger. During the Napoleonic period accuracy in combat tended to be at best 1/10th what it was on the practice field, and was usually much worse.

148,"""More time than a smoothbore musket"" in general. It varied a lot depending on rifle and what kind of load is used. Many flintlock rifles had fairly short barrels which offset the loading time quite a bit. The twist, number, and depth of the grooves might also affect loading speed somewhat.

British troops armed with the baker rifle typically carried premade paper cartridges similar to those used my muskets for when rapid fire was needed. Loading these involved essentially same number of steps as a smoothbore musket with the exception of the ramrod being pushed into the barrel using both hands instead of just one, in order to ensure that the cartridge is forced down with one stroke. Over time fouling would make this more and more difficult, but initially the effect on loading time probably wasn't that major. However, when maximum accuracy was needed a rifleman would be taught instead load his powder using a powder measure rather than a cartridge, then take a loose ball, wrap it in a piece of cloth or leather, then carefully push it to the bottom of the barrel. When all this was repeated in between every single shot for long range shooting, the fire rate did indeed become quite glacial again.",2016-09-22 09:59:17+00:00,d7x9di0,4.0,t1_d7wyhbb,26757.0,AskHistorians

150,"16th century sources do indeed tend to be pretty unclear when it comes to firearm's rate of fire. Humfrey Barwick was a strong proponent of firearms at the end of the century and as such is probably represents the upper end of what might be expected in terms of fire rate. While serving as a mercenary for the French army he described a war meeting in which he overheard a nobleman claim that an arquebus could only be fired 10 times per hour. Some people apparently did think the fire rate was this low, but Barwick thought the man was daft and afterwards approached him offering to personally demonstrate shooting 40 times in one hour with a single piece. One shot every 1 minute and 30 seconds doesn't seem like much, but this seems to have only been the rate for long term fire over the course of an hour, which would have required occasionally cleaning the weapon, adjusting the match, and measuring the powder for each shot independently since a soldier at the time typically didn't carry 40 whole wooden cartridges at a time.

For short term rate of fire, later on in his discourse he described the maximum number of times that a soldier with a *musket* could shoot at an advancing army, which involved shooting once in the time it took the enemy to march (not running) 80 yards (presumably 60-90 seconds, he recommended making up the difference by shooting multiple bullets at a time as the enemy got closer).  The fact that he says this is for a musket is significant because the 16th century musket was a very different beast compared to the muskets of the 17th and 18th centuries. It was extremely heavy with a longer barrel and a larger bore than later weapons and had to be supported by a forked rest while firing. Most troops at the time would have been armed with an arquebus or caliver, firearms which which were much lighter and had a much shorter barrel. Humfrey Barwick and Sir Roger Williams both wrote that the arquebus/caliver could fire twice as quickly as the clumsy musket could (though they prefered the latter because of its far greater force).

That would make the ideal rate of fire for the late 16th century arquebus/caliver: 30-45 seconds per shot max, 40 shots per hour sustained

And for the heavy musket: 60-90 seconds per shot max, 20 shots per hour sustained.

As far as how rate of fire compares to the wheel lock or flintlock. A matchlock is generally more complicated to load since it requires constantly tending the match to keep it burning as well as adjusting the match length as it burns down. In addition manuals on loading reccomends removing the match after every shot and holding it in the opposite hand so the soldier doesn't accidentally blow himself up while handling powder (loading could still potentially be done much faster if shortcuts are taken as demonstrated by [this reenactor with an arquebus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-lGCtbg580)). A wheel lock firearm did away all this but added the need to reset the spring with a specialized tool after every shot. As far as flintlocks go, most manuals and sources tend to give a maximum fire rate of around 3, maybe four shots per minute. As far as I know, even with greatly simplified drills reenactors tend to have a lot of difficulty reloading a full sized Napoleonic musket in under 20 seconds.

So to sum up, 16th century muskets did take a long time to reload, largely due to its size. A flintlock musket was generally quicker and easier to reload than a 16th century matchlock caliver (which was similar in length and weight) though probably not as much as you're saying. And there was more to reload speed than the type of lock.",2016-09-21 21:25:18+00:00,d7wlp92,1.0,t3_53uetz,13151.0,AskHistorians

See this recent discussion by /u/PapiriusCursor

It is true that soldiers in the early modern era were typically far less accurate in combat than they were on the practice field, P.B. Hughes in his book *Firepower* concluded that a typical musket volley scored a hit rate of only around 5% at 100 yards despite the fact that experiments in the 18th-19th centuries found volleys could hit a batallion sized wooden target 50-70% of the time at the same distance. Whether this was due to a ""psychological resistance to killing"" in part or at all however is not clear, there doesn't seem to be much direct evidence to support that theory, and most authors such as Hughes tend to conclude that mechanical or typical battle-stress related explanations are sufficient to account for the discrepancy.

In 1860 the US army conducted a series of experiments (Fuller, *The Rifled Musket*) which involved shooting various types of rifles at 10ft wide, square targets at various distances. When 10 soldiers were told to fire 5 shots each in volleys they struck all over the face of the target, sometimes performing almost as poorly as the smoothbore muskets at 100 yards. When 10 men were told to fire ""as skirmishers"" they were more accurate, but still generally struggled to stay on the board, never mind hitting the center. Shortly afterwards the experiment was repeated using the same weapons, but with only one soldier shooting and reloading his weapon 10 times in a row. This time the rifle bullets typically all struck an area less than 12 in across at 100 yards. This just goes to show just how much the smoke, noise, and pressure of having even 9 other soldiers shooting alongside a person can effect accuracy. Never mind on a battlefield when thousands of men are shooting at once and the enemy is a moving target which is also shooting back or charging forward with a bayonet.",2016-09-21 18:36:51+00:00,d7wd8je,1.0,t3_53s5gd,37550.0,AskHistorians

The concept of recreating corps of longbowmen like those from the Hundred Years War to fight in modern conflicts was occasionally brought up by various writers in the 17th-19th centuries, notably Ben Franklin during the Revolution, but generals at this time couldn't field such troops even if they wanted too (in fact it seems that Franklins' recommendation to fill the colonial army with companies of pikemen was taken much more seriously than his archery suggestion).

The more complex answer is that bows and arrows likely wouldn't have helped much anyways. Even when archery was still widely practiced the question of whether bows or matchlock muskets were more accurate in a direct comparison seems to have been debatable at best. Writing about his early years as in the English army in the mid 1500s, Humfrey Barwick claimed that his commander held trials of arms 2-3 times a week involving longbows, crossbows, and firearms which wound up leaving little doubt that firearms were the most accurate of the three. He also concluded that after just a few months of training with his arquebus he could hit any target near or far as well as ""the best archers in England."" When the matchlock musket arrived in China and Korea, local sources wrote that on the practice field they would strike the target ""five times better than the bow and arrow.""

A soldier's musket like those used during the revolutionary war could supposedly strike the the figure of a man at 80 yards, a feat that takes quite a lot of practice to match with a bow and arrow. A hunting musket, which used a ball that fit the barrel more tightly and a much smaller powder charge, was likely even more accurate and that's not even getting into the American long rifle, which could supposedly strike a man's head at 200 yards most of the time. In late 18th century trials it was found that volleys of musket fire could inflict casualties on a battalion-sized target 400 or even 500 yards away, which is even more so exceedingly difficult to match with longbows. In actual combat the accuracy was always much lower than on the practice range and it wasn't too uncommon to see entire musket volleys miss at 100 paces, but the fact that so much of it is attributable to human error suggests that replacing the muskets with a weapon far more complicated to aim and shoot would not have helped much.

In theory it doesn't take a lot to kill an unarmored man. Dr. Joseph Bill's ""Notes on Arrow Wounds"" compiled various examples of arrow wounds suffered on the american frontier in the 19th century and concluded that they were indeed quite deadly, particularly if they struck the lungs or gut, or if the arrowhead broke inside the wound and surgery was not available. However even so it seems that the sheer stopping power of a large-caliber musket ball tended to be much preferred and had a far greater psychological impact. With a full military charge an 18th century musket ball could achieve a muzzle velocity of almost 1.5 times the speed of sound, shattering bones and creating a larger wound cavity than even many modern assault rifle rounds. Arrows by contrast are unlikely to break bones and may not even pierce the skull unless shot from a powerful bow. As an example of this from the Napoleonic Wars, French general Marbot wrote about his experiences fighting Asian horse archers who had been levied by the Russian army mocking the fact that their arrows caused only ""minor wounds"" if they hit and claimed that he recalled seeing only one man actually killed by the weapon. Marbot himself was wounded by an arrow which penetrated ""about an inch"" into his thigh. He claimed that he didn't even notice it until it got in the way of his sword hand, and even then it did not affect on his ability to command.

The one real advantage archers would seem to have over firearms would seem to be rate of fire. However, even that comes with caveats. A smoothbore musket could be loaded with a wide variety of ammunition, and in the americas loading a weapon with multiple bullets has a long history, dating all the way back to Samuel de Champlain who in the early 17th century was able to kill two Iroquois chiefs and wounded a third in a single shot by loading his arquebus with four bullets. During the revolutionary war, double shotting muskets or loading them with buckshot was extremely common to the point where ""buck and ball"" cartridges made of one musket ball and 3-4 buckshot became standard in the continental army. In terms of total projectiles it was definitely possible for guns to achieve a higher overall rate of fire than bows and arrows (the record for a punt gun is around 500 birds with a single shot) however in terms of total aimed shots then the bow could win out as long as the archer's strength holds.

Overall I highly doubt bows would have been a very effective weapon for either side during the revolution. If a bunch of american colonists were given bows and arrows and told to go fight a guerilla war against the British, it would probably go about as well as this account of John Mason fighting Pequot archers shortly after the Mystic Massacre:

&gt;The Enemy still following  us  in  the  Rear,  which  was  to windward,  though  to  little  purpose ;  yet  some  of  them  lay  in  Ambush  behind  Rocks  and  Trees,  often  shooting  at  us,  yet  through  Mercy  touched  not  one of us : And as we came to any Swamp or Thicket, we made some Shot to clear the Passage. Some of them fell with our Shot; and probably more might, but for want of Munition

Wet weather was identified pretty early on as a potential weakness of firearms, although 16th century mercenary Humphrey Barwick argued that a good soldier should know how to keep his powder and match dry in the rain, and that if it really was ""so wet that everything is wet"" then it would be bad weather for archers and infantry to attack in as well.

The amount of power packed in gunpowder could sometimes vary quite a bit depending on the manufacture, quality, and grain size. But assuming the powder was just damp enough that it still burned but didn't burn completely then close range penetration might be affected pretty heavily but range, probably not so much. This is due to the fact that air resistance on a round bullet is not linear, and affects faster bullets much more heavily than slower bullets.

To use the matchlock tested during the 1988 experiments in Graz, Austria as an example, at 100 meters the velocity of the bullet had already dropped from 449 m/s to 264 m/s.

I was looking through Fuller's *The Rifled Musket* the other day and the results of the 1860 tests are sort of interesting. Each weapon had three different tests at each range, one where 10 soldiers were told to fire 5 shots by volley, one where they were told to fire by files, and one where they were told to fire as skirmishers. For the volley test at 100 yards the single shot scored 37 hits while the buck and ball scored 36 hits with the ball, which is pretty similar accuracy. When told to fire as skirmishers however the single shot hit 43/50 times while the buck and ball hit only 33/50 times, even worse than the volley fire. Since just about every single other weapon tested achieved higher accuracy when skirmishing rather than volleys I'm kind of tempted to write that off as an outlier though, especially since the buck and ball was back to matching the single shot smoothbore for accuracy in all three 200 yard tests. That would seem to suggest that the buck and ball load didn't have much of an effect on accuracy. It also doesn't seem to have had much of an effect on rate of fire, since US soldiers were still expected to achieve 2-3 shots per minute with buck and ball cartridges. 

So it doesn't seem like there was much reason not to use buck and ball. But it's still curious that other nations don't seem to have been interested in it.",2016-09-11 00:15:14+00:00,d7hku44,2.0,t1_d7h5pht,23574.0,WarCollege

174,"Bombs are almost as old as gunpowder itself and the idea of shooting bombs out of a cannon is almost as old as cannons. For most of its history the shell was just a hollow iron cannonball packed with gunpowder and a hole for a fuse to stick out. They were fired at a low velocity usually out of a cannon with a short, extra wide barrel. The problem was that they weren't very accurate and the fuses were extremely inconsistent; sometimes they would go off too early, sometimes too late, and sometimes not at all. As a result they were generally limited to siege warfare, they especially weren't used in ship to ship combat very often.

In the late 18th and early 19th century shells started to become much more popular. Fuzes became much more precise, and greatly improved knowledge of ballistics science meant that a gunner could look up values on a chart and pick out the precise length of fuze needed to explode a shrapnel shell directly over the heads of a line of infantry. During the Civil War firing both solid shot and explosive shells out of cannon was common.

175,"In the early 1500s the Spanish and Italians were primarily using arquebuses instead of crossbows. The musket started to be used in small numbers by the Spanish from around 1520 onward.

Starting in the mid 1500s mounted arquebusiers and pistol-armed reiters were becoming popular as well, and by the end of the century they were being deployed in larger numbers than lance-armed cavalry.

The English were one of the last nations in western Europe to adopt firearms. Compared to the Hundred Years War and the Wars of the Roses they were not involved in as many major campaigns and instead chose to rely on Longbowmen and small numbers of foreign mercenaries with firearms for the first part of the century. From the 1540s onward however it was becoming apparent that English longbowmen were performing very poorly in wars against troops armed with firearms on the mainland. The English government started to modernize its army rapidly, importing large numbers of firearms and paying arquebusiers and musketeers higher wages than it did for other infantry. Despite laws requiring archery practice still being in place and attempts made to limit firearm practice and hunting during peacetime English archery continued to see a steady decline. By 1590 it was noted that very few fit archers were showing up to muster and a few years later the government declared the bow no longer fit for service.

The excuse he gave was that the large, bright colors were too destracting and made it difficult to aim. Maybe there really is some psychological factor that makes it harder to aim at a large target or makes people less likely to take careful aim.

177,"Is it just me or do historians seem to be all over the place with their interpretations of the [Graz Armory Experiments](https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/MCR/article/view/17669/22312)? Seriously, in some cases it's almost at the point of ""The Graz tests showed a bunch of rusty, antique muskets could only hit a 30 cm (11.8 in) target half the time at 100 meters. Clearly smoothbore firearms were completely useless beyond 15 yards!""

If you are currently writing a paper and plan to cite these tests here are some things to keep in mind:

-The firearms selected for the tests were specifically chosen to represent lower-quality weapons, largely because they didn't want to risk damaging any of the nicer weapons they owned. And it seems as though the hundreds of years of rust and corrosion weren't kind to the weapons they did want to test, two of those they picked out had to be thrown out beforehand because an analysis showed it would be too risky to actually load them with gunpowder. To show what nicer weapons or a different load might do [here's a youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ-UazWAOSk) where some guy manages to outperform the Graz tests at 97 yards despite not even using a mechanical rest.

-A spread of 0.5m to 1m at 100 meters isn't even that bad. Sure it's terrible compared to modern weapons, but as far as the 16th-18th centuries go it's pretty good. It's more than enough to strike a formation with consistency, and it still means you can take down that high-ranking officer from a football field away at least half the time (just tell a couple of your buddies to fire at him also if it's that important). Also, just because a musket only hits a 30cm target 50% of the time it does not follow that the bullets simply vanish into to the aether and will never in a million years strike the broadside of a barn at 200 yards. To use Moritz Thierbach's summary of early 19th century musket trials as an example: even though only 60% of the musketeers struck a 100 ft wide ""battalion"" target from 75 m away, 25% were still able to hit the target at 225 m and 20% were still able to hit it at 300 m away. One test performed by the French army in 1800 found that 5 out of 100 bullets fired were still able to hit a 1.9 m tall battalion target at 471 m! If any of those figures were actually achieved in combat by an army of thousands of men it would be absolutely devastating.

-If you want to use other sources to argue that musket fire wasn't useful beyond a very short range that's all well and good (there are certainly plenty that support that position). But don't just drop the Graz tests in there like they completely prove your point because they don't really. If anything they suggest that the magnus effect on its own isn't nearly enough to explain away the extreme inaccuracy often attributed to muskets, and you'll have to dig much deeper to explain what's really going on.",2016-09-06 06:25:33+00:00,d7b7pl0,1.0,t3_4zpdzx,915203.0,badhistory

180,"&gt; A hunter would more likely use a rifle

During the 17th and 18th centuries no, rifles were still expensive and fairly uncommon. The most popular hunting firearms during this time were indeed smoothbore.

Smoothbores were indeed accurate enough to make decent hunting weapons at the range most bow-hunting traditionally took range at. Colonel Hanger, who was a serious critic of musket accuracy in the early 1800s still concluded that an infantry musket, if not badly bored, would strike a target the size of a man at 80 yards. Civilian hunting smoothbores, commonly known as fowlers, could achieve much greater accuracy by using a ball that fit snugly in the barrel and a much smaller powder charge than what was used in military muskets. Against large game such as deer and buffalo they would still propel a bullet with far greater force for far less effort than could a bow and arrow. (Edit: it's worth noting that while the Brown Bess of the late 18th century generally didn't have a rear sight, rear sights were common on fowlers as well as many matchlock and wheellock firearms dating back to the 16th century)

Various sizes of buckshot and birdshot were also widely used by smoothbore hunting muskets since the 16th century. Some larger fowling pieces were reportedly able to wipe out entire flocks of birds with one shot, and as early as 1548 the english government was trying to regulate the use of ""hail shot"" by sportsmen in order to prevent game populations from being depleted.

In North America firearms quickly became popular among native tribes for both hunting and warfare. Despite early attempts to limit the firearms trade, guns and ammunition quickly became one of the biggest if not the biggest trading item in the new world. In 1628 the Indians in new England were reported to be ""full of fowling pieces, muskets, pistols, etc."" By the 1640s they were reported to be casting their own bullets in a wide variety of sizes and able to perform repairs on their firearms about as well as ""any Englishman"".  In the colonies it quickly became a requirement that every militia member own a firearm of some sort along with both musket shot and smaller shot since pikes and polearms were found unsuitable for the terrain. Without the many hunting restrictions which existed in England hunting quickly became a common means of putting food on the table, and in some cases mass killings were carried out against certain ""nuisance"" animals like crows and wolves.

181,"That's a fairly widely accepted opinion but it doesn't necessarily hold up. If the longbow is only more effective when the longbowman is given 10 years of training and the arquebusier is only given a couple hours or a week to train then how does that make it a better weapon? The fight would be just as one-sided if it were an arquebusier with 10 years of training against one who had barely trained at all.

That's what makes Barwick's arguments interesting, since he comes at the problem from the perspective of a footsoldier who actually had spent years learning to master his arquebus (he also spent his youth learning to shoot a longbow and, according to him, was a pretty good shot with it). His conclusion was pretty one-sided, claiming that he could out-shoot the best archers in england with his arquebus, that in combat he had seen hundreds of men killed with bullets for every one killed by a bow or crossbow, and basically that the longbow was an antiquated weapon completely worthless on the modern battlefield.

184,"It's sort of tricky to pin down what range exactly Barwick thinks point blank is. At times he does seem to use it in the modern sense: the distance beyond which a shooter needs to elevate his aim in order to hit his target.

Also, while I'm on the subject there are some places Barwick misrepresents smythes' claims somewhat as well. Barwick constantly repeats that Smythe did not think firearms useful beyond 8-12 yards which isn't completely true, he claimed arquebusiers had an effective skirmish range of 40-60 yards, and the shorter ranges he gave were only for receiving a charge (with the maximum range given as 15-20 yards, not 12). So maybe don't believe everything published in the 16th century either.

John Smythe actually thought the arquebus was an alright weapon as far as firearms go due to the fact that it was relatively light and easy to handle. Humfrey Barwick and Roger Williams (another writer) both generally preferred the power of the musket, in particular the heavy Spanish musket they fought against in the lowlands. Barwick wrote that if only the musket could be used on horseback like an arquebus then it would be ""the best of all manuall weapons, that yet haue beene deuised and inuented.""

199,"It seems like the AI sometimes gets stuck aiming at a spot directly above the enemies heads. It happened against the musketmen as well, although at that range the arrows were inaccurate enough that they would occasionally go low and score kills.

Also, the poacher arrows looked like they were killing everything in one hit now. Were they buffed or do musketmen and archers just have really low hp now? 

Anyways, I don't have the pre-alpha, and and I realize this game isn't really meant to be realistic but here are some thoughts for /u/wilnyl on what i've seen of musketmen so far.

-the impact of the Magnus Effect on the accuracy of smoothbore muskets tends to be somewhat overstated, with a good, long barrel and a fairly snug ball a musket from a mechanical rest will shoot with a spread of about 1-2 feet at 100 yards. That's very hard to achieve with a bow or crossbow, especially since a Bowman needs to be much more careful about estimating range, windspeed, elevation, etc. Which is why a majority of 16th century writers concluded that matchlocks actually were far more accurate than bows.

-Given how innacurate the muskets in the game are and their tendency literally send people flying they seem to be acting more like short barrel, large caliber [handcannons](http://www.treasurenet.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=329883&amp;d=1332405799), from the late middle ages. Although that kind of just makes the guns fit the era better, even though they look like flintlocks instead.

-if you ever decide to try and implement tactics options, a good one would be a slider to set the maximum engagement range of different units. Gunmen clearly could shoot all the way across the if the aimed upwards a little bit, and sometimes you might want them to just sit in the corner and hardware the enemy with covering fire, other times you might want them to hold their fire until they get really close to the enemy where their initial volley will be far more accurate and devastating. Choosing the perfect range to start shooting at would be even more important if gunmen had their rate of fire nerfed.",2016-08-13 11:47:00+00:00,d6fs4ye,1.0,t3_4xhw1l,20568.0,AccurateBattleSim

That's better than Humfrey Barwick's claims, and it doesn't necessarily mean they were that terrible as archers, there were similar complaints about the effectiveness of English longbowmen as well: the top shooters only represented a small proportion, long campaigns would weaken them and make it more difficult to draw their bows, in combat many archers stopped drawing their arrows all the way to the head, archers had to shoot at closer ranges, etc.

[This site](https://sellsword.wordpress.com/2011/08/09/firearms/) talks a little about musket accuracy and sums up the results of a number of musket trials which were preformed in the 18th and 19th centuries against large wooden targets representing an enemy batallion. They may not seem that impressive, but realize that even a 5% hit rate at 400 yards would mean that 1000 musketeers are inflicting a devastating 200 casualties a minute if they ever actually achieved that in combat (even a 50% hit rate at 100 yards would have absolutely anihillated any bayonet charge). But of course that rarely ever happened, instead soldiers during the Napoleonic period generally inflicted closer to 1-3% casualties at 100 yards, even though a musket at that range is basically just point and click. That's because a battlefield, even back when troops fought standing side by side in lines, is vastly different to a practice range. The problem that keeps coming up with all these bow vs musket debates is that people talk up the effectiveness of the bow on the practice range and assume that it's going to be similar in combat, when it clearly isn't.

209,"This really isn't true, aside from a few nostalgic writers pining for the good old days of Crecy and Agincourt it was pretty much universally agreed that the English Longbow had performed extremely poorly when it faced off against mainland foes armed with matchlock firearms during the 16th century. Few longbowmen were capable of consistently shooting a military arrow more than 200-240 yards, while a heavy Spanish musket ""will kill the armed of proofe at ten skore yardes, the common armours at twenty score, and the vnarmed at thirty skore, being well vsed in bullet and tried powder.""  In terms of accuracy, a bow only wins out when shot from a mechanical rest at a stationary target with consistent arrows. In combat accuracy always drops dramatically, even among well trained soldiers, and when that happens the weapon which is more complicated to aim always suffers the most by far.  Blaize de Montluc wrote about his experiences fighting English longbowmen in 1545 (the same year the Mary Rose sank loaded with 120-180 longbows) and noted that the English archers consistently had to shoot at far shorter ranges than the French arquebusiers did. At one point he wrote that the English waited until they got to within ""4 or 5 pikes length"" before shooting their arrows. He generally only felt threatened when the English had brought along a few musketeers to provide covering fire or when they were backed up by Italian mercenaries armed with firearms.

Even the rate of fire advantage bows had wasn't really that significant. English mercenary Humfrey Barwick argued that over the course of a battle one man with a firearm would deliver more than twice as many shots than a bow, due to the fact that the firearm could shoot at longer ranges and by the time the enemy got into bow range they could quickly close to melee. He also pointed out that unlike a bow a musket could be loaded with multiple bullets at once or small shot, which was a fairly common practice at closer ranges. Muskets loaded with pistol bullets or small shot were noted to be very effective at Jamestown colony and during the Pequot War.

And that's not even getting into the other advantages of firearms including the ability to penetrate armor and the fact that firearms easier to shoot from cover. According to Barwick, over the course of his career as a mercenary he had seen thousands of men killed by bullets, but only a few killed by crossbow quarrels, and he struggled to remember seeing any killed by archers despite fighting alongside all three weapons. It's really no wonder that the English was working so quickly to replace the Longbow with matchlock firearms by the end of the century.

210,"It's hard to say why two-handed weapons remained rare for so long. I think it's clear many people thought two-handed weapons beat out sword and shield in melee after they became popular, but I don't know of that was also prevailing opinion back when shield walls were still the prevailing tactic. Admittedly I'm less knowledgeable about that period.

Improved armor or at least more widely available armor does seem to be a likely culprit. Shields were seen as a necessity in battle for a very long time and even soldiers who did use two-handed weapons like the Dane axe in the early middle ages often carried a shield anyways. For example [this Saxon Huscarl](http://previews.123rf.com/images/jorisvo/jorisvo1401/jorisvo140100009/24854192-Detail-of-the-Bayeux-Tapestry-depicting-the-Norman-invasion-of-England-in-the-11th-Century-This-tape-Stock-Photo.jpg) is shown receiving the initial cavalry charge with a spear and shield while holding his daneaxe in his shield hand. Afterwards many of the huscarls are shown having discarded their spears and shields and fighting with their axes alone. The start of a wider adoption of two-handed weapons does generally coincide with the growth in popularity of mail reinforced by plate in the later 13th century. Pikes were used by Scots during the Wars of Scottish independence as well as Flemish urban militias to effectively counter heavy cavalry, however the poorly armored Scots did prove to be very vulnerable to english longbowmen. During the hundred years war many English and French knights chose to fight dismounted and for them the main weapons of choice were generally either shortened lances or other two-handed polearms.

It's sort of hard to blame it entirely on the invention of plate armor though. I know that some historians like Dan Howard would probably argue that good quality mail over a thick gambeson or a bronze hoplite cuirass could protect against arrows just as well as a late Renaissance munition breastplate. Thick padded jacks and other standalone textile armors were also extremely popular during the 12th-15th centuries and according to some sources described as providing fairly good protection. According to the Ordinances of King Louis XI on the subject of 25-30 layer linen jacks,  ""Thus shall the wearer float, as it were, within his jack and be at his ease; for never have been seen half a dozen men killed by stabs or arrow wounds in such Jacks, particularly if they be troops accustomed to fighting.""

So to answer your question, maybe. It's hard to know for certain what the specific reason was, it may even have been a combination of reasons. Sorry I can't be of more help, if you ping one of the medieval flairs they might be able to provide you with a better answer.",2016-08-08 18:37:00+00:00,d69c3yh,3.0,t1_d68zf62,17533.0,AskHistorians

212,"It was from an unnamed french footsoldier Humfrey Barwick claimed to have spoken to while serving as a mercenary for the King of France sometime in the late 1500s. Barwick was an arquebusier, but had learned to use the english longbow as a boy and was trying to impress the soldier by talking about the longbow's power and rate of fire. The Frenchman simply replied that it was not a weapon to be feared.

&gt;for saith he, when I doo marche directlye vpon them and seeing them comming, I doo stoupe a little with my head, to that ende my Burgonet shall saue my face, and seeing the same arrowes lighting vpon my heade peece or vpon my brest, pouldrons, or vambra∣ces, and so séeing the same, to be of no more force nor hurtfull: then doo I with lesse feare then before, boldelye aduaunce forwardes to encounter with them.

This seems to have been a big part of the reason Barwick became so critical of archery, since he himself was struggling to remember ever seeing someone killed by the archers that fought alongside him. Sir John Smythe, a staunch defender of the longbow even as it was falling out of fashion, also noted that arrows tended to rarely kill armored men outright, and instead focused more on their ability to wound unarmored parts of the body and kill rider's horses.

214,"The trend towards two-handed weapons on western battlefields began well before firearms started to become a major force, although they may have helped hasten the shield's decline (while metal shields and armor were often proofed against pistols in the 16th century, Sir Roger Williams noted that a shield thick enough to protect against more powerful weapons like the musket would be too heavy to fight with for long periods of time). It's also true that a well armored individual doesn't necessarily need a shield to protect himself from arrows and crossbow bolts. According to one French soldier, all he needed to do was tilt his head forward a bit so that his helmet protected his face and he could advance fearlessly into a hail of arrows while they bounced off his armor. Even if a soldier was only wearing a helmet and a breastplate it became relatively unlikely for an arrow wound on his limbs to be fatal.

As for melee combat, by the late 16th century it seemed to be agreed that longer polearms held the advantage over the sword and shield in most situations. Englishman George Silver, who wrote about fencing in 1599 claimed that the two-handed sword, battle axe, half-pike, and pike all held the advantage in single combat over the sword and buckler or sword and target (a type of shield strapped to the arm), even going so far as to suggest that a half-pike might be able to fight off two swordsmen at once. In massed combat however Silver seemed to think that the sword and target could still an effective weapon. Military writers Robert Barret and William Garrard claimed that the sword and target were the best weapons for fighting in tight spaces like mines, trenches, or a breach. They also thought that they would be pretty strong weapons in a press of men, citing the effectiveness of the Ancient Roman legions. Roger Williams agreed about the mines and trenches, but wrote ""The Pike is the chieftest weapon to defend, and to enter a breach"" as long as it had small numbers of shot and halberders or targeters to back it up. Barret and Garrard both still only recommended around 2 or 3 targets per 100 infantry, and all the writers generally agreed that on a flat plain, nothing could resist a push of pike.",2016-08-08 02:21:08+00:00,d68j4ql,1.0,t3_4wkva9,45683.0,AskHistorians

First, unlike the movies, [decent mail or plate armor usually protected pretty well against most bows and crossbows](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2r9x2l/polearm_formations_vs_arrows/cndwzoo) (/u/elos_). Attacking troops could also rely on troops with [large shields](http://manuscriptminiatures.com/5152/16001/) or pavises to lead the way and protect them from projectiles. Even after the bulk of medieval infantry started to be equipped with polearms or other two-handed weapons, shield-bearers or [targeteers](http://imgur.com/a/7IZSI) continued to be a popular choice for leading the assault over over the enemy walls or into a breach. Attackers could also rely on makeshift mobile defenses like mantlets or [large shacks on wheels](http://manuscriptminiatures.com/4143/7307/) (edit: commonly known as tortoises) to protect sappers or battering rams while they got close enough to damage the enemy defenses.

Last, it's important to remember that attackers were generally shooting back at the defenders as well. Cannons and siege engines definitely made it dangerous for defending archers to stay on top of walls and towers while bowmen and crossbowmen who advanced close to the walls behind thick pavises might be close enough to harass or pick off defenders who leaned to far out over the wall or spent too much time trying to take careful aim at important targets. Archers on top of [wooden siege towers](http://manuscriptminiatures.com/4165/7790/) might be high enough to shoot at an even level or even down on top of defenders atop the walls. Once armor became less useful due to the proliferation of firearms it started to become more and more important for attackers to gain fire superiority during an assault. In the late 1500s, mercenary Humfrey Barwick described how one fortified town fell in a single day with minimal casualties because the French arquebusiers got so close to the walls that the spanish defenders could not stick their heads over the top to fight back while French engineers blasted their way in.",2016-08-06 05:42:13+00:00,d66eezv,1.0,t3_4wd49h,24919.0,AskHistorians

After the Indian Massacre of 1622 the king of England offered the Jamestown settlers bunch of old arms an armor from the tower of london which were obsolete in Europe but might still be effective against Indians. These included billhooks, chain mail shirts, and 400 longbows with 800 sheaves of arrows. The colonists accepted everything but the longbows and arrows, which they requested to be left on bermuda. Apparently this was because they did not want their English bows and arrows to fall into Indian hands.

222,"The bow was officially phased out by the English army in the 1590s, although English laws requiring archery practice remained on the books well into the 17th century and men with bows continued to show up on muster roles for quite a while, but the usual practice was to lump them with the unarmed men and try to find them muskets.

The last significant attempt to revive military archery by the English army was during the Ile de Re Expedition of 1627, during which counties were ordered to supply up to 24% of their troops with bows, but it isn't clear how many archers actually took part in the expedition. There also may have been small numbers of archers who fought during the English Civil War.

They were writing for readers who already knew what contemporary combat was like so most of them didn't really see the need to.

That said there are a couple of reasons that archers might not use all of their arrows before engaging. The first may have been to preserve their strength. Repeatedly pulling a 100-150 lb warbow is extremely difficult, and one of Humfrey Barwick's complaints about archers in the late 16th century was that they tended to grow tired during combat and stop drawing their arrows all the way back. This problem was compounded if the archer had to spend a lot of time ""roughing it"" while on the campaign trail. Second, archers may just not have had enough time to shoot many arrows before one or both sides charged into melee. Not every archer in the army may have been capable of shooting at maximum range, especially with heavy war arrows, and those that could may have preferred to shoot at close range anyways where their shots would be more accurate and powerful. Messire Blaize de Montluc described encounters with English archers shortly before the Mary Rose sank and noted that they tended to shoot at very short ranges, at one point he writes that they closed to within ""4 or 5 pike lengths"" before shooting a shower of arrows.",2016-08-01 16:52:49+00:00,d5zshe1,1.0,t3_4vlpur,25319.0,AskHistorians

245,"Initially the introduction of gunpowder did coincide with an increase in the use of plate armor, partly due to improving metallurgy and partly because while good quality mail or very thick padded jacks might be enough against arrows and crossbow bolts they didn't protect very well against bullets.

247,"This is a copy-paste of a response I gave a while back to someone asking whether bows and arrows would have been effective during the Revolutionary War, explaining that when smoothbore matchlocks fully replaced bows in the 16th century many people did consider the gun's to have far better range and accuracy than bows:
 
-

French General Baron de Marbot wrote about his encounters with Tartar and Baskir horse archers fighting for the Russians during the Napoleonic wars. Overall they were found to be very unimpressive, even though the French wore almost no armor. He also gives an example of why the ability of archers to fire over the heads of troops in front of them isn't as much of an advantage as you would think. 

&gt;I have never understood with what aim the Russian government brought from so far and at such great expense these masses of irregular cavalry, who having neither sabres nor lances nor any kind of firearm, were unable to stand up against trained soldiers, and served only to strip the countryside and starve the regular forces, which alone were capable of resisting a European enemy. Our soldiers were not in the least alarmed at the sight of these semi-barbarous Asiatics, whom they nicknamed cupids, because of their bows and arrows.
&gt;
&gt;Nevertheless, these newcomers, who did not yet know the French, had been so indoctrinated by their leaders, almost as ignorant as themselves, that they expected to see us take flight at their approach; and so they could not wait to attack us. From the very day of their arrival in sight of our troops they launched themselves in swarms against them, but having been everywhere repulsed by gunfire, the Baskirs left a great number of dead on the ground.

-

&gt;With much shouting, these barbarians rapidly surrounded our squadrons, against which they launched thousands of arrows, which did very little damage because the Baskirs, being entirely irregulars, do not know how to form up in ranks and they go about in a mob like a flock of sheep, with the result that the riders cannot shoot horizontally without wounding or killing their comrades who are in front of them, but shoot their arrows into the air to describe an arc which will allow them to descend on the enemy. But as this system does not permit any accurate aim, nine-tenths of the arrows miss their target, and those that do arrive have used up in their ascent the impulse given to them by the bow, and fall only under their own weight, which is very small, so that they do not as a rule inflict any serious injuries. In fact, the Baskirs, having no other arms, are undoubtedly the world's least dangerous troops.

The supposed superiority of bows and arrows over even smoothbore firearms in terms of range and accuracy is likely greatly overstated. During the late 16th century the abandonment of the longbow by the English army was a very controversial and a great deal was written by experienced military men both for and against the switch. Some, like Sir John Smythe did indeed feel that England's ancestral weapon was vastly superior to firearms and that muskets were completely useless beyond 20-30 yards. But many others, such as Roger Williams, claimed that a musket with good powder was deadly to both horse and man at up to 600 yards. According to him, bowmen were ""the worst shot used these days"" and in the field 1500 bowmen would be less effective than 500 musketmen. Humfrey Barwick, an English soldier who served as a mercenary on the continent wrote a lengthy rebuttal to many of Smythe's arguments and claimed that he personally could hit a single man with his arquebus at 120 yards while doubting that the best archers in england at the time could do the same. Obviously not every musketman could achieve this, especially in the heat of battle, but bows would be even more difficult to aim. As Barnabe Rich put it, a bow may miss wide, short, or long while a firearm may only miss wide. What seems to be a common thread is even bow proponents noting that the number of archers skilled enough to reliably outshoot a skilled man firearm seemed to be fairly small, and dropping rapidly. Barwick took this one step further and noted that in his experience archers had a tendency to rapidly grow tired in combat and stop bringing their arrows to full draw, or that poor nutrition and sleeping in the cold might leave them too weak to shoot their bows at all.

A couple other arguments made in favor of firearms in the late 16th century:

-A flatter trajectory meant that a standing man presented a larger target, thus a bullet was more likely to hit than an arrow falling down at an angle.

-The weakest guns tended to have far more force than even the strongest bows. Unless you are using an extremely high draw-weight bow it might not be enough to break bones or pierce a man's skull or ribcage. Only the thickest armors could stop most firearms.

-Guns could be used more easily from cover than bows could and could be kept in a ready to fire position.

-At shorter ranges muskets could be loaded with multiple projectiles. This is especially relevant to the revolutionary war when double-shotting muskets or loading them with ""buck and ball"" shot was extremely common. Even in terms of volume of fire a formation of archers would likely still be at a disadvantage against a line of musketmen firing 4-5 shots per minute and 2-5 projectiles per shot.

258,"While he doesn't use that phrase exactly, Humfrey Barwick's *A breefe discourse* is a good example of that attitude dating back to at least the late 1500s. At the time firearms had almost completely replaced longbows in the English army and Barwick was writing in response to traditionalists who opposed the abandonment of what they considered their national weapon. He spends a great deal of time arguing that while the longbow may have been the best weapon on the battlefield in times past warfare had greatly changed due to the introduction of firearms. He gave multiple examples of how what used to be considered sufficient armor in the past was far weaker than the armor being used today.

Sir John Smythe in particular he accused of trying to prove archery's effectiveness with examples which were 200 to 2000 years old at the time.

""And whereas Sir Iohn Smith doth rehearse ma∣nye and sundrye exsamples of victories and ouer∣throwes, giuen by the force and effect of Archers, some aboue 2000. yéeres since, and some 200 yéeres since, and the most betwixt these times: but what hath béene doone since the perfect knowledge of fire weapons hath béen in vse? and wheras Manuell the Emperour of Constantinople, had in his armour or Target the number of 30. arrowes sticking: one Harquebuze or Musket shot would haue dispatched the matter,""

He even sarcastically asks if England should also give up its cannons and go back to using battering rams and other weapons fit for savages.

""what, shall we refuse the Cannon and fall to the Ram againe? or to knowne weapons more meeter for Sauadge people then for puissaunt Princes, that are able to maintaine those of the greatest force?""

282,"The pikes that were occasionally used during the Napoleonic wars as well as the ""Joe Brown pikes"" used during the US Civil War were around 7-8 feet long, meaning they were closer to a spear or medieval ""half-pike"" rather than what we think of as a true medieval pike which could be up to 20 feet long. That aside, in an era where bayonet charges were still common there was still reason to believe that soldiers armed with pikes might still be effective. As Governor Brown put it ""Hand to hand, the pike has vastly the advantage of the bayonet, and those having the bayonet, which is itself but a crooked pike, with shorter staff, must retreat before it."" His argument was that since enemy infantry rarely stood their ground in the face of a bayonet charge they would definitely not stand their ground in against charging pikes.

In George Silver's 1599 ""Paradoxes of Defence"", he argued that the half-pike or short staff is one of the best weapons for single combat, having the advantage over swords and buckers, two-handed swords, battle axes, and morris pikes. However in massed combat he writes ""The morris pike defends the battle from both horse and man, much better than can the short staff. . .""

In the 19th century however, the very long pikes which would dominate during a push of pike were no longer being used by the enemy, so for a theoretical force armed with pikes they would only need their weapons to have slightly more reach than a musket and bayonet.",2016-07-02 05:31:19+00:00,d4wbkrc,1.0,t3_4qtkgl,36034.0,AskHistorians

298,"It took a quite a while for firearms to really ""completely take over"" rather than being combined with pikes and other melee weapons, but in the 16th century, when the matchlock really became widespread, mercenary Humfrey Barwick did note that battles seemed to be far more often fought at range rather than the two sides closing to melee like they did in the past. Barwick gave a number of reasons for why he thought firearms were far superior to bows, but the big one which really impressed every firearm proponent tended to be the massive force of the weapon. A warbow drawn by an extremely strong archer might shoot an arrow with up to 100-150 Joules of kinetic energy, but firearms relying on stored chemical energy could achieve far more. In tests performed at Graz Austria, one antique 1580s musket was able to achieve a muzzle energy of nearly 7000J. According to Barwick, armored soldiers needed only to tilt their head forward to protect their face and they could advance into a hail of arrows completely unafraid, but heavy muskets on the other hand though could pierce good quality armor as far out as 200 paces.

More power = better also tended to be the prevailing opinion when comparing different firearms. Sir Rodger williams wrote about calivers (a firearm which was a bit lighter and had a smaller caliber than the musket): ""the Caliuers may say they will discharge two shot for one, but cannot de∣nie; but one Musket shot doth more hurt than two Ca∣liuers shot"". Barwick also mentioned that he thought the musket to be much better than the caliver/arquebus.

Edit: to add a little bit more to the discussion, the concept of ""switching"" between direct and indirect fire with bows is probably not the best way to look at it. In order to shoot with the maximum amount of force a bow needs to be drawn all the way each time. That means against a distant target you need to shoot at 45 degees, against a close target you need to shoot at 5 degrees, against a target in-between you need to shoot at 25 degrees and so on.

337,"Whether the pilum was intended to bend or break on impact is somewhat disputed. I believe it goes back to Roman historian Peter Connolly who was doing experiments with pilum replicas and found that hitting a shield generally wasn't enough to actually make the iron shank bend.

Basically there is very little evidence that it was supposed to bend. Polybius wrote that the light, 3-foot javelins used by skirmishers were designed to bend on impact, but not the pilum. There is a literary account that Gaius Marius ordered his troops to replace one of the pins on their pilums with a wooden one which would break on impact, but there's no mention of how effective this was or whether the practice was continued.

There are good reasons why the Romans wouldn't want their pilums to bend most of the time. If you have a projectile that bends or breaks on impact then it is basically wasting a good deal of energy and isn't going to penetrate nearly as well as something sturdier. According to Vegetius the barbed head was more than enough to prevent roman javelins from being removed from a shield.

&gt;I have never understood with what aim the Russian government brought from so far and at such great expense these masses of irregular cavalry, who having neither sabres nor lances nor any kind of firearm, were unable to stand up against trained soldiers, and served only to strip the countryside and starve the regular forces, which alone were capable of resisting a European enemy. Our soldiers were not in the least alarmed at the sight of these semi-barbarous Asiatics, whom they nicknamed cupids, because of their bows and arrows.
&gt;
&gt;Nevertheless, these newcomers, who did not yet know the French, had been so indoctrinated by their leaders, almost as ignorant as themselves, that they expected to see us take flight at their approach; and so they could not wait to attack us. From the very day of their arrival in sight of our troops they launched themselves in swarms against them, but having been everywhere repulsed by gunfire, the Baskirs left a great number of dead on the ground.

-

&gt;With much shouting, these barbarians rapidly surrounded our squadrons, against which they launched thousands of arrows, which did very little damage because the Baskirs, being entirely irregulars, do not know how to form up in ranks and they go about in a mob like a flock of sheep, with the result that the riders cannot shoot horizontally without wounding or killing their comrades who are in front of them, but shoot their arrows into the air to describe an arc which will allow them to descend on the enemy. But as this system does not permit any accurate aim, nine-tenths of the arrows miss their target, and those that do arrive have used up in their ascent the impulse given to them by the bow, and fall only under their own weight, which is very small, so that they do not as a rule inflict any serious injuries. In fact, the Baskirs, having no other arms, are undoubtedly the world's least dangerous troops.

The supposed superiority of bows and arrows over even smoothbore firearms in terms of range and accuracy is likely greatly overstated. During the late 16th century the abandonment of the longbow by the English army was a very controversial and a great deal was written by experienced military men both for and against the switch. Some, like Sir John Smythe did indeed feel that England's ancestral weapon was vastly superior to firearms and that muskets were completely useless beyond 20-30 yards. But many others, such as Roger Williams, claimed that a musket with good powder was deadly to both horse and man at up to 600 yards. According to him, bowmen were ""the worst shot used these days"" and in the field 1500 bowmen would be less effective than 500 musketmen. Humfrey Barwick, an English soldier who served as a mercenary on the continent wrote a lengthy rebuttal to many of Smythe's arguments and claimed that he personally could hit a single man with his arquebus at 120 yards while doubting that the best archers in england at the time could do the same. Obviously not every musketman could achieve this, especially in the heat of battle, but bows were still even more difficult to aim. What seems to be a common thread is even bow proponents noting that the number of archers skilled enough to reliably outshoot a skilled man firearm seemed to be fairly small, and dropping rapidly. Barwick took this one step further and noted that in his experience archers had a tendency to rapidly grow tired in combat and stop bringing their arrows to full draw, or that poor nutrition and sleeping in the cold might leave them too weak to shoot their bows at all.

A couple other arguments made in favor of firearms in the late 16th century:

-A flatter trajectory meant that a standing man presented a larger target, thus a bullet was more likely to hit than an arrow falling down at an angle.

-The weakest guns tended to have far more force than even the strongest bows. Unless you are using an extremely high draw-weight bow it might not be enough to break bones or pierce a man's skull or ribcage.

-Guns could be used more easily from cover than bows could and could be kept in a ready to fire position.

-At shorter ranges muskets could be loaded with multiple projectiles. This is especially relevant to the revolutionary war when double-shotting muskets or loading them with ""buck and ball"" shot was extremely common. Even in terms of volume of fire a formation of archers would likely still be at a disadvantage against a line of musketmen firing 4-5 shots per minute and 2-8 projectiles per shot.

371,"From this article

https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/MCR/article/view/17669/22312

&gt;In the 18th century, trials were conducted to determine how accurate the fire from infantry battalions was. Moritz Thierbach, writing in 1866, summarized several Prussian, Bavarian and French tests as if they had been one standardized effort involving 60 shots at target approximately 100 feet (30 m) long by seven feet (2.13 m) high.6 Thierbach calculated that from a distance of 75 metres, only 36 shots (60 per cent) penetrated the target; from 150 metres, 24 shots (40 per cent); from 225 metres, 15 shots (25 per cent); and from 300 metres, only 12 bullets (20 per cent) found their mark. The Graz tests suggest Thierbach may have been optimistic in his estimates.

Does anyone know any English sources that go into detail about these tests or similar musket tests from the 18th century? I keep hearing them mentioned, sometimes with slightly different numbers, but I'm having trouble finding a reference for them.


As an aside, the statement ""The Graz tests suggest Thierbach may have been optimistic in his estimates."" is sort of confusing me. The quote above states Thierbach was giving a 60% accuracy rate against a 2.13 meter tall target at 75 meters away, while the Graz test found smoothbore weapons had a spread of between about 50 and 80 cm at 100 meters. If anything that makes it seem like soldiers with smoothbore muskets could have potentially achieved much higher accuracy than Thierbach gave.",2016-05-27 19:30:33+00:00,d3m4y9k,1.0,t3_4lav27,19667.0,AskHistorians

378,"It's a fairly complicated question. In England the move from longbow to firearm was an extremely controversial issue and there was a great deal written by experienced military men arguing both for and against. Among them claims about the effectiveness of early firearms were all over the place, Sir John Smythe claimed that musket fire beyond 20 yards or so might as well be aimed at the moon while a number of gun proponents claimed that musket shot was deadly as far out as 600 yards. Barwick claimed that he personally could confidently hit a single man with his arquebus at 120 yards and doubted that the best archer in England could reliably do the same. Barwick is also notable in that he felt that it took a very long time to teach someone how to shoot a gun properly, and was worried England would be vulnerable to invasion if the army did not start building up a musketry tradition. In the end though the pro-gun arguments apparently won out and the longbow was officially abandoned by the english army. 

The pattern of guns replacing bows was similar elsewhere in europe and in the ottoman empire. During the japanese invasion of korea, Japanese matchocks were reported as badly outmatching the korean archers. And in North America, many native tribes were quick to adopt trade muskets or other blackpowder weapons for both hunting and warfare. There are exceptions however, the most notable being composite bow-armed Manchu conquest of Ming china despite the latter fielding large numbers of matchlocks. The new Qing dynasty would later incorporate more and more firearms into their armies but the Manchu soldiers continued to rely heavily on their bows well into the 19th century.

382,"That is sort of an oversimplification. For starters, most medievial shields were not just bits of wood. The practice of layering wood with linen, rawhide, and other materials to create a composite shield much stronger than wood alone had been known for thousands of years at this point, though it still may not have been enough to protect against firearms. In the late middle ages Pavises and Mantlets remained common forms of protection. And small round shields strapped to the arm continued to be used by some soldiers, most notably the Spanish rodeleros. [This painting](http://www.warfare.altervista.org/Renaissance/Conquest_of_Oran-assault.htm) of the Conquest of Oran is a good example of Spanish sword-and-target men leading the assault over the walls. Some of the metal shields would be ""proofed"" against a pistol which was fired at close range (though heavier weapons such as the spanish musket were more difficult to protect against), and as late 1598 Robert Barret described a soldier armed with pistol, sword, and pistol-proof target as being the best for storming an enemy breach, however he still only recommended 2 or 3 soldiers per 100 be armed that way.

In general though, you are right about the two main reasons for the shields decline.

A. Armor became better, cheaper, or both depending on who you ask and the shield became less necessary.

B. There was a growing preference for two-handed weapons which could not be easily used with a shield. In the field, formations of Swiss pikemen were dominating the opposition. In single combat George Silver claimed that two handed polearms or two handed swords both had the advantage over either sword and bucker or sword and target, though he felt the target was still somewhat effective in mass combat due to its weight. In either case shields at this point had been relegated to small specialist roles, and were eventually dropped completely.",2016-05-25 02:49:17+00:00,d3ilnm4,2.0,t1_d3i7u11,20699.0,AskHistorians
383,"Occasionally archers would roughly estimate the range of an enemy they couldn't see directly, but for the most part archers struggled to shoot over the heads of other soldiers in front of them, much less solid walls. According to Sir John Smythe this was exactly the reason the medieval English always placed their archers either at the front or the wings of the formation. He blamed the declining effectiveness of the longbow during the 16th century in part on the fact that contemporary officers would place firearms at the front and wings of the formation and relegated archers to the rear, where their sight was taken away by the guns' smoke, and they were unable to shoot through the dense forest of pikes.

During the Napoleonic Wars, French general Baron de Marbot, described his encounters with horse archers levied by the Russians and noted that their inability to form ranks seemed to put them at a significant disadvantage.

&gt;With much shouting, these barbarians rapidly surrounded our squadrons, against which they launched thousands of arrows, which did very little damage because the Baskirs, being entirely irregulars, do not know how to form up in ranks and they go about in a mob like a flock of sheep, with the result that the riders cannot shoot horizontally without wounding or killing their comrades who are in front of them, but shoot their arrows into the air to describe an arc which will allow them to descend on the enemy.

While he recalled one man who had an arrow pass though his torso, killing him outright, for the most part it seems that the arrows either missed or caused only minor wounds despite the french being completely unarmored.

Members of the upper classes at least would generally be responsible for their own day to day training, and results likely varied.

391,"&gt;Are we really to believe that England had thousands of these longbowmen who could casually row a 145 lb dumbbell? That simply sounds insane by modern strength standards.

There is a bit of contention over exactly how many soldiers could shoot very high strength bows, as well as whether they could really do so ""casually"". The Mary Rose was the English flagship and it's crew may not have been representative of the rest of the army. It also possibly represents the peak of longbow archery, since this was a point where armor was growing thicker and thicker to counter newly introduced firearms. After the Mary Rose sank longbow archery seems to have declined rapidly until it was completely abandoned by the english army less than 50 years later. In 1570's, pamphleteer Barnabe Rich estimated that if 1000 english longbowmen were mustered from two counties, within a week only 100 of them would be able to shoot an arrow beyond 200 paces, with the average range being between 180-200 paces. Humfrey Barwick, an English mercenary from the later 16th century and a major critic of archery claimed that he frequently saw archers grow tired after a few shots and stop drawing their arrows all the way back, or that after weeks of sleeping in the cold and eating poorly while on campaign they were often too weak to draw their bows at all.",2016-05-20 23:40:32+00:00,d3dkj47,1.0,t3_4k3vo0,105656.0,AskHistorians

In addition an underarm thrust tends to have surprisingly little power behind it compared to an icepick thrust, even when performed with two hands, so the argument goes that armor vulnerable to sword thrusts would be easily pierced by polearms, arrows, crossbow bolts, etc. That's why the general opinion seems to be that the sharp sword points were designed for thrusting at gaps in armor or places where the armor is weaker.",2016-05-12 22:11:30+00:00,d339z1h,2.0,t1_d3337lh,9191.0,badhistory

There does seem to have been a desire for some generic term to refer to these sorts of polearms though, since they all tended to function in a pretty similar way. Robert Barret in his Theorike and Practike of Moderne VVarre for example seems to switch around between ""halberds and bills"", ""halberds and such short weapons"", and just ""halberds"". Sometimes this category included sword and target men as well, since he felt that they all filled a similar role in a pike and shot formation.

418,"There were a couple of people who thought pikes still had a place on modern battlefields. The main idea was that they were cheap to make, and since battles were still often decided by a charge a weapon which was lighter and had more reach than a musket and bayonet would be extremely effective. During the French invasion of Spain in 1808 the British decided to send around 80,000 pikes along with other aid in order to arm Spanish volunteers and irregulars. Apparently some of these were used in combat against the French along with homemade polearms made out of farming scythes.

In the US, abolitionist John Brown contracted a local blacksmith to make around 1000 pikes to help arm his slave rebellion. At least some of these were used in his attack on Harper's Ferry. In 1862 Confederate governor Joe Brown came up with a plan to order 10,000 collapsible pikes for arming Confederate troops. Several thousand were produced, but the few companies that were armed with them were generally unhappy about being given such antiquated weapons, and since this was a period where Confederate troops were generally doing well the move was seen as a waste of money. Joe Brown's pikes never saw any serious combat.

It's probably worth noting that in this period ""pike"" generally referred to a weapon about 6-8 feet long, closer to a medieval half-pike rather than something extremely long.",2016-04-30 00:19:10+00:00,d2mrxv2,1.0,t3_4h1atz,14556.0,AskHistorians

420,"Defining primary weapon as whichever weapon the soldier uses first then the answer is almost universally no. In general the one-handed arming swords, bastard swords, and two-handed swords all had blades of roughly the same length which was short enough to be comfortably worn in a scabbard on the hip freeing the hands to carry a lance, poleaxe, bow, javelin, etc. The exception to this were ""great swords"" like the German [zwiehander](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Landsknecht_with_his_Wife.jpg) from the late middle ages which had a very long blade and handle and would be carried and wielded a bit more like a polearm. The sword would then be used once all the missiles were gone or the polearm was lost or broken.

According to George Silver, polearms generally held the advantage in both single combat and massed combat but he still stressed the arming sword as a reliable self-defense weapon (with the two-handed sword or sword and buckler being slightly better in single combat, while the sword and target was slightly better in massed combat). William Barret, writing at around the same time considered a pistol-proof shield, sword, and pistol to be the best weapons for storming a breech in the enemy's walls, but still only recommended 2 or 3 shield men per 100 soldiers.

At least twice a day they ought to practice sparring with someone else while wearing heavy armor and using a weighted sword and weighted shield. There was also spear-throwing with an extra heavy spear shaft, archery practice, stone throwing, slinging, and then re-learning all these arts with their left hand as well as their right.

When tested at 100 meters, most of the smoothbore muskets were found to have a spread a little under 2 feet wide. Barwick's estimation was that he personally could reliably hit a single man sized target at 120 paces given two shots, which seems reasonable assuming he was using a slightly higher quality weapon than the experimenters.

In the 19th century Moritz Thierbach summarized several Prussian, Bravarian, and French tests against ""battalion targets"" 2.1 m high and 30 m long which gave figures of 60% of shots hitting the target at 75 m and 20% of shots hitting the target at 300 m.

Robert Barret gave the caliver a range of 400-480 paces. Barnabe Rich gave the caliver a range of 360-400 paces and the musket a range of 480-600 paces. According to Humfrey Barwick, a musket with good powder could kill an unarmored man at up to 600 paces, a man in common armor at 400 paces, and a man in good quality ""pistol-proof"" armor at 200 paces. He recommended taking the first shot with a musket at 480 paces while the arquebus and caliver should be used at shorter ranges.

Barwick is notable in that he felt firearms were tricky weapons which would take months or even years of training to learn to shoot properly. Inexperienced soldiers who failed to compensate for the massive recoil of their weapon or didn't take the time to aim properly, may help explain why some commanders preferred to hold their fire until 30 yards or closer.",2016-04-27 03:54:52+00:00,d2ix8dx,1.0,t3_4gmeu9,5329.0,AskHistorians

428,"We do have fair amount of literature from late 16th century England comparing the relative merits of firearms and longbows at least. In general proponents tended to praise them for their incredible range and power compared to contemporary weapons, especially heavier weapons such as the musket. 

Probably one of the biggest proponents of firearms from the period was Humphrey Barwick, an English mercenary who after spending his career fighting wars on the continent wrote a discourse essentially outlining why he thought firearms were superior to bows and crossbows in pretty much every conceivable way. He even had answers for the slow rate of fire (according to him skilled musketeers should know how to elevate their weapons and start shooting volleys at up to 480 paces, allowing them to get more shots in against a closing enemy than archers could. Then at close range the muskets and arquebuses could be loaded with multiple bullets at a time, turning them into shotguns).

As for crossbows, while a steel bodkin is more efficient at penetrating than a lead ball for the most part the energy difference was insurmountable, especially with armor growing thicker and thicker. It takes an extremely powerful crossbow to shoot a bolt with more than 200 joules of kinetic energy, many 16th century firearms on the other hand could easily shoot a bullet with up to 3000 J. The largest musket from the Graz tests had a muzzle energy of almost 7000 J. Also, while the relative accuracy of the weapons might see some debate there is definitely something positive to be said about the weapon that has the highest velocity, since it makes it easier to hit moving targets and estimating range is far less critical.",2016-04-23 05:14:11+00:00,d2e043c,1.0,t3_4g0qke,25962.0,AskHistorians

There was the occasional thinker from time to time who suggested returning to bows (notably Ben Franklin once recommended that the entire colonial army should be armed with longbows), but it doesn't seem to have ever been seriously considered.

Armies with muskets did continue to fight archers from time to time during the 18th - 19th century. During the Napoleonic Wars the french faced large numbers of Bashkir and Tartar horse archers fighting for the Russians. These bow armed-troops were quickly nicknamed ""cupids"" and the french found them very non-threatening.

From the Memiors of General Baron de Marbot:

&gt;With much shouting, these barbarians rapidly surrounded our squadrons, against which they launched thousands of arrows which did very little damage because the Baskirs, being entirely irregulars, do not know how to form up in ranks and they go about in a mob like a flock of sheep, with the result that the riders cannot shoot horizontally without wounding or killing their comrades who are in front of them, but shoot their arrows into the air to describe an arc which will allow them to descend on the enemy. This system does not permit any accurate aim, and nine tenths of the arrows miss their target. Those that do arrive have used up in their ascent the impulse given to them by the bow, and fall only under their own weight, which is very small, so that they do not as a rule inflict any serious injuries. In fact the Baskirs, having no other arms, are undoubtedly the world’s least dangerous troops.
&gt;
&gt;However, since they attacked us in swarms, and the more one killed of these wasps, the more seemed to arrive, the huge number of arrows which they discharged into the air of necessity caused a few dangerous wounds. Thus, one of my finest N.C.O.s. by the name of Meslin had his body pierced by an arrow which entered his chest and emerged at his back. The brave fellow, taking two hands, broke the arrow and pulled out the remaining part, but this did not save him, for he died a few moments later. This is the only example which I can remember of death being caused by a Baskir arrow, but I had several men and horses hit, and was myself wounded by this ridiculous weapon.
&gt;
&gt;I had my sabre in my hand, and I was giving orders to an officer, when, on raising my arm to indicate the point to which he was to go, I felt my sabre encounter a strange resistance and was aware of a slight pain in my right thigh, in which was embedded for about an inch, a four-foot arrow which in the heat of battle I had not felt. I had it extracted by Dr. Parot and put in one of the boxes in the regimental ambulance, intending to keep it as a memento; but unfortunately it got lost.
&gt;
&gt;You will understand that for such a minor injury I was not going to leave the regiment, particularly at such a critical time…",2016-03-30 02:03:19+00:00,d1ijzqk,1.0,t3_4cicpl,5970.0,AskHistorians
459,"Well, he was writing about the 45 years after the Mary Rose sank. And the quality of archers must have dropped off pretty quickly if at age 17 he could outshoot any english archer he knew with the notoriously inaccurate arquebus.

Do you really not think it's strange? That english archery apparently completely collapsed in such a short period of time with only a small nudge despite longbow practice still being mandatory and firearms still in their infancy? Is this supposed to be something that happened often, with societies learning how to preform amazing feats of archery before completely forgetting how just a few decades later?

That archers of the day couldn't hold a candle to to the archers they read about who fought at crecy and augincourt was a common complaint among defenders of the longbow in the 16th century, but I'm just not sold that's it's not mainly a case of old men blaming problems on ""kids these days.""",2016-03-30 00:51:03+00:00,d1igwne,15.0,t1_d1icwy3,5863.0,AskHistorians

Humphrey Barwick grew up learning the longbow around the time that the Mary Rose sank and claimed that archers were completely ineffective beyond 180 yards. From his experience as a mercenary he complained that archers with heavy bows would quickly become tired and stop drawing their arrows back all the way, rendering them useless, and that after weeks on campaign they might be too exhausted to draw their bows at all.

463,"The other posters have already covered it pretty well. And while the social factors and ability to keep soldiers under control were major factors, it helps to think in terms of commanding very large forces. Dense formations have been around long before blackpowder firearms have, if a general has an army of 10,000s of men and he doesn't want the enemy to face them piecemeal then he needs to pack them in shoulder to shoulder and fit as many on the front line as possible. When muskets were introduced their slow rate of fire and relatively poor accuracy meant that whoever could put the most bullets in the air at once easily gained fire superiority, so it continued to be important to fit as many men into the front lines as possible. Even if a sniper did start shooting from cover they generally weren't going to do much damage until your troops replied. 

Linear formations started to phase out with the advent of rifles, breechloaders, and finally machine-guns and improved artillery meant that a small group of men could easily slaughter dozens out in the open within seconds.",2016-03-28 10:06:09+00:00,d1g6gpr,1.0,t3_4by8yt,221707.0,AskHistorians

466,"Interesting test firing data of antique small arms done in Graz, Austria 1988-89. The tests found the weapons to have surprisingly high muzzle velocities (between 400-500 m/s, well over the speed of sound) which dropped off quickly due to air resistance. The estimated maximum range of the projectiles was around 1 km. The largest musket tested, a wheel lock from the 1580s, was found to have a muzzle energy of 6980 Joules, more than twice that of a modern assault rifle.

The pistols were tested against a target at 30 meters and the muskets were tested against one at 100 meters. The black powder weapons were found to be extremely inaccurate compared to modern weapons, against the 30 cm target at 100 meters they averaged about 50% hits. These were 200-400 year old antiques though and may have been more accurate when new. There is also not much detail on how exactly the weapons were loaded during the test and what kind of wadding was used. Strangely, only one of the three rifled muskets tested (G284, RG 272, and STG 1288) performed better than the smoothbores.

From the Ordinances of King Louis XI again:

&gt;And first they must have for the said jacks, thirty or at least twenty-five, folds of cloth, and a stag's skin being the best cloth that has been worn and rendered flexible, is best for this purpose, and these jacks should be made in four quarters. The sleeves should be as strond as the body, with the exception of the leather, and the arm-hole (assiette) of the sleeve must be large, which arm-hole should be place near the shoulder, that it may be broad under the arm-pit and full under the arm, sufficiently ample and large on the sides below. The collar should be like the rest of the jack, but not made too high behine, to allow room for the salade. This jack should be lace in front, and under the opening must be a hanging piece (porte piece)of the same strength as the jack itself. Thus the jack will be secure and easy, provided there be a pourpoint without sleeves or collar of two folds of cloth, that shall be only four fingers broad on the shoulder; to which pourpoint shall be attached the hose. Thus shall the wearer float, as it were, within his jack, and be at his ease; for never have been seen half-a-dozen men killed by stabs or arrow wounds in such jacks, particularly if they be troops accustomed to fighting.

No mention of metal plates sewn in anywhere. I don't know where you're getting this idea that a ""jack"" only refers to armor that has metal plates in it.

My post as it stands is still entirely correct. Enough layers of fabric will stop any medieval crossbow bolt, a thick enough steel plate will stop any medieval crossbow bolt, and a sturdy enough shield will stop any medieval crossbow bolt.

 People like to jump to conclusions because they hear factoids like ""arbalests had draw weights of more than 1000 lbs!"" but the truth is that draw weights tend to be very misleading when it comes to medieval crossbows and they tell you very little about the range or penetration on their own.

There was also that one person explaining how they would conquer the world with their modern knowledge of metallurgy (I don't remember if they were bringing the wiki page on metallurgy back with them for reference).

You're comparing a Medieval European crossbow with an Ancient Chinese one. Medieval European crossbows generally had a fairly short draw length while Chinese ones tended to be closer to the length of regular bows. Shooting longer, heavier bolts means most Chinese crossbows would have a much lower velocity than what you've listed.

620,"I've recently begun using the Sherman jumbos in Arcade and they are actually pretty good. If you angle them right they become pretty much completely immune to tigers and most Russian tanks and while you may not get many kills you can rack up loads of points by absorbing shots. If you are really good at finding weakspots you can still do quite a bit of damage with the 75mm, and if nothing else the thicker armor means you can take riskier flanks.

As for the 76mm it's an improvement, but you still won't be penetrating much unless you are specifically aiming for weak points. You'll probably want to exclusively use solid shot or APCR for this gun because you need the pen, and you will quickly begin to resent this game every time your shot passes through the enemy gunner and only turns him yellow. But the APCR especially does have pretty good pen.

If you really want my advice though, go back to the tier 2 75mm Shermans and the M4a2 and just practice with them over and over again until you get the hang of killing T-34s and KVs from the front by picking off weak points, because one you get into higher tiers that's pretty much all you will be doing.",2016-01-16 07:31:20+00:00,cz07hgr,1.0,t3_4165si,22512.0,Warthunder

Caesar described the pilum as being able to pierce through two overlapping Gallic shields at once, pinning them together. Heavier javelins like this were usually used as a shock weapon, thrown at close range while charging towards the enemy.

Light infantry and skirmishers however usually used far lighter javelins, often only 3-4 feet long with a shaft only half an inch thick. These were less powerful than the heavy ones, but would usually be thrown with the use of an Amentum, or throwing string, which worked a little like the American atlatl to give the projectiles significantly more range and accuracy.

Edit: Also, the ability of a javelin to be used one-handed with a shield cannot be understated during a skirmisher ""duel"". In addition javelins were effectively a fire-and-forget weapon, where as with archery it was fairly impractical to let loose a few arrows and then throw away your bow onto the dirt.",2015-09-27 20:26:20+00:00,cvg58e5,1.0,t3_3mlpyu,7010.0,AskHistorians

In either case, I think it's still a legitimate question.

According to the 13th century *Konungs Skuggsja*, for example, ""You must also be specially careful, when in the battle line, never to throw your spear, unless you have two, for in battle array on land one spear is more effective than two swords.""

Also, while a man could technically learn to shoot a gun in a couple of weeks,  it could still take months or years to become  truely proficient with a matchlock according Humphrey Barwick.

Anyways, getting back to the OP's question of why not include archers to shoot over the heads of the musket infantry. I think you may be overestimating the effectiveness of indirect Archery, shooting at a target you can't actually see is extremely difficult, and would require an extreme amount of practice to pull off with any degree of accuracy, this is why archers would usually be deployed as skirmishers in front of a medieval army or on top of high ground where they could have a commanding view.

He pointed out that skilled solders with firearms were more accurate and had a far greater range than archers did, and that they even had a better overall rate of fire since they could start shooting at much longer ranges and at short ranges firearms could be loaded with multiple projectiles. He also complained that the longbowmen would quickly become tired and fail to draw their bows back all the way, rendering them useless, and that if they hadn't been eating three hearty meals a day or their arms were stiff from sleeping in the cold they would be too weak to draw their bows at all.

Anyways, I recently had a trip to the UK and back and I spent the flights watching obscure foreign movies that I'd never heard of before, so I figure I should give some reviews.

*The Admiral: Roaring Currents-* a Korean film about the Battle of Myeongnyang. It was pretty good and, as far as my knowledge about the Japanese invasion of Korea goes, 100% accurate. There was one part during the battle where the Koreans were fighting with explosive arrows, so the Admiral orders the archers to light their fuses and draw their bows, ready to shoot, but then the film seems to forget about them and the fight goes on for another 10 minutes before someone finally remembers ""oh yeah, we should probably have these guys holding literal time bombs actually shoot before one of them gets killed by a cannonball or a musket shot"". I also have doubts about the ability of those wooden shields the Koreans are using to stop bullets. But aside from all that it was pretty good.

*The Taking of Tiger Mountain-* I can't figure out if this is based on an actual event, but it's about a group of PLA soldiers during the Chinese Civil War who have to fight an army of bandits in northern China who have taken over a castle built by the Japanese army and stocked with weapons, artillery, and tanks. It's pretty exciting and full of slow motion shots of bullets performing amazing ricochet shots and shooting grenades out of the air, sometimes right after you see a PLA soldier blow his cover by griping over a metal bar, so I don't know what exactly it says about their dexterity. Also there's a part where the PLA soldiers are making makeshift cannons out of empty oil drums, I don't think that would work. Anyways it's a very optomistic and forward thinking movie, complete with the damsel in distress near the end bravely informing the evil bandit Lord Hawk that the Revolution will come for all.

This cultural relativist argument you're making is one that comes up a lot, but it really isn't one that *can* be made. It's self-contradictory in a number of ways, for instance if we presume that John Green comes from a culture that doesn't consider it wrong to criticize past cultures, then by your own logic you can't criticize him for doing just that.

The truth is that cultural relativism is only one method of interpreting morality, and it isn't a particularly strong one for making moral arguments, as demonstrated above. Moral realists, by contrast, would contend that an explicitly wrong action is always wrong, regardless of where or when it is committed. If you wanted to refute that then you'd need to form an argument that shows why an action is not explicitly wrong, and eventually why it was not wrong in this specific instance. But that requires philosophical arguments and opens up a whole new can of worms, which is why it's generally easier to just avoid it.

937,"It's somewhat debatable whether the gladius was actually superior to longer swords. A lot of it seems to go back to Polybius, who frequently brings up the fact that the Roman swords were apparently much better at thrusting than those of the Gauls. For instance this description of a battle against Gauls in 223 BC:

&gt;When the Celts had rendered their swords useless by the first blows delivered on the spears, the Romans closed with them, and rendered them quite helpless, by preventing them from raising their hands to strike with their swords, which is their peculiar and only stroke, because their blade has no point. The Romans, on the contrary, having excellent points to their swords, used them not to cut but to thrust: and by thus repeatedly hitting the breasts and faces of the enemy, they eventually killed the greater number of them.

However, he never actually gives the impression that the gladius was only made for thrusting. As he describes it, ""It has an excellent point, and can deal a formidable blow with either edge, because its blade is stout and unbending."" And in many instances he claims that the Romans were trained to fight with a 3 foot gap between each soldier so that they had room to swing their swords.

On the other hand though, the sword Polybius was describing was most likely the Gladius Hispaniensis, the type most commonly used during the Republican period, which wasn't particularly short. It was generally more than 30 inches long with a 24-26 inch blade. In the 1st century BC the Roman army largely switched over to the more famous Pompeii-type gladius, which was only 24 inches long with an 18 inch blade. The Pompeii Gladius was used up until the late 2nd century AD when it started being replaced by the much longer Spatha.",2015-08-05 06:31:53+00:00,cts25v7,1.0,t3_3fu1w3,9676.0,AskHistorians

Pikes were chosen as a last resort to arm militias because they were cheap and highly effective melee weapons. The only reason they didn't see more use is that they required two hands to carry, and muskets were far more versatile.

Edit: it should also be noted that the pikes in question during the civil war were not the same as the extremely long ones used during the middle ages or the sarissas used by Alexander the great. The pike Joe Brown invented had only a 6 foot shaft with a 1.5 foot detachable blade.

In his instructions on how pikemen should fight:

""When the advancing columns come within reach of the balls, let them move in double quick time and rush with terrible impetuosity into the lines of the enemy.""

 ""Hand to hand, the pike has vastly the advantage of the bayonet, and those having the bayonet, which is itself but a crooked pike, with shorter staff, must retreat before it.""

But I'd still like to point out that bringing up draw weight alone is almost completely useless when it comes to discussing how powerful a crossbow is. It's a decent metric when discussing traditional bows since you can expect archers to draw the string back roughly the same distance each time, but there isn't any sort of set power-stroke length when it comes to crossbow design.

To use an extreme, if a crossbow has a draw weight of 2000 lbs but a power stroke of only 2 inches, then the total stored energy is only going to be around 225 joules (and unless the crossbow is 100% efficient, not all of that is going to be transferred to the projectile).",2015-07-31 20:19:14+00:00,ctn7e4u,4.0,t1_ctmj0yw,49393.0,badhistory

The rifle did eventually take over in the 19th century since rifled barrels did have the advantage over smoothbore ones, especially when combined with other advancements like the minie ball and breach-loading. However none of the arguments given include ""the rifle was much cheaper and easier to train, allowing hordes of rifle-armed conscripts to zerg rush smaller numbers of noble, traditional warriors armed with smoothbores.""

Early gunpowder cavalry like [reiters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reiter) frequently carried 2 or more pistols which could be fired in quick succession before charging in with a sword.

Most were too heavy to be carried and had to be used from carriages like artillery, but some like the British nock gun were made to be fired as hand-held weapons.

They still never really caught on however. Loading 4 barrels and then firing 4 barrels was still never going to be as quick as load, fire, load, fire. And the amount of damage done by a single extra infantry volley at range was rarely enough to justify the expense of affording every soldier a second firearm. In addition, if a simple overwhelming volume of fire ever was needed at close ranges it would have been much easier to simply load cannons with grapeshot or load single-barreled, large-caliber muskets with hail shot than it would have been to mess around with heavy, complicated volley guns.",2015-07-30 22:34:52+00:00,ctm3wja,1.0,t3_3f722h,12304.0,AskHistorians

[The tables from The Knight and the Blast Furnace](http://i.imgur.com/sNTuna8.jpg) show 1 mm of steel armor requiring 450 Joules to penetrate with a bullet and only 55 J to penetrate with an arrow.

As for the effectiveness of mail it's a bit more complicated. The actual amount of protection can vary pretty considerably depending on exactly how thick the wire is,the metal's hardness, whether the ring struck is solid or riveted, and how well set the rivet is. In addition experimental archeologists like to point out that mail hanging by itself from a tree branch does not behave like mail worn over a padded jack or gambeson will. 

All that said, it's kind of hard to argue with primary sources. And unless De Soto just so happened to capture some sort of one of a kind, 16th century Andre the Giant then the fact that the arrows did so well against what was supposed to be top of line European armor definitely says a lot about the quality of native American archery.",2015-07-21 05:27:16+00:00,ctalgji,5.0,t1_ctaaa0m,21277.0,AskHistorians

Polybius actually went into detail comparing the Roman Maniple formation to the Macedonian Phalanx.

He accepts that the phalanx is almost unbeatable head on and on flat ground due to their many rows of spearpoints and the fact that the phalangites could be packed shoulder to shoulder while the Romans needed to keep sizable gaps in between each man in order to utilize their swords effectively. However, as Polybius puts it:

&gt;But if the enemy finds it possible, and even easy, to avoid its attack, what becomes of its formidable character?

The phalanx-based army is rarely able to decide when and where a battle is to take place. And even when they do they can rarely force the enemy to stay in one place nor can they force the enemy to attack along the whole length of the phalanx evenly. As a result, the flexible maniple formation was far more effective in practice.",2015-07-19 21:22:48+00:00,ct8zpbk,1.0,t3_3dt7q0,56373.0,AskHistorians
