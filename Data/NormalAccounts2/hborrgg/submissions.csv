Arranging thousands soldiers in massive squares up to 70 or more ranks deep with a relatively narrow frontage allows them to advance much more rapidly while maintaining cohesion and then use their mass to smash through the center of a thin, defensive line routing it in the process. Towards the end of the 16th century the ""great squares"" started to be replaced by a larger number of smaller pike squares arranged in a triplex acies-inspired checkerboard pattern with a battallion-sized gap between each one. This he argues improved firepower and allowed a individual squares to be defeated and then retreat in good order without the route infecting the entire army.

So my question is, does any of this relate to ancient Macedonian pike tactics? I generally see the macedonian phalanx depicted as a single continuous line [like this](http://www.livius.org/a/1/maps/issus_map.gif). Is this accurate, or would there have been gaps for archers and skirmishers to fight in? Would a Macedonian phalanx have had to advance much more slowly or fight more defensively than a Swiss pike square? And if not what was the reason, were they better trained than pikemen in the middle ages or fighting on more open ground?",AskHistorians,"Did Macedonian Phalangites use Renaissance-style ""pike squares""?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5e32il/did_macedonian_phalangites_use_renaissancestyle/

So my main complaint with the image here is that it for some reason goes knight, knight, knight, knight, knight, knight, musketeer with cuirass. Implying that the musketeer is somehow a 17th century ""evolution"" of the knight.

First off, by the end of the 16th century, musketeers and calivermen on foot wearing any armor aside from perhaps a helmet had become extremely rare ([early 17th century musketeer](http://www.re-enactmentsupplies.co.uk/image/cache/data/Musket-500x500.png)). A matchlock musket alone could weigh up to 20 lbs or more, not counting all the ammo and other equipment. So pretty much no one wanted to haul around a breastplate in addition to all that, and military theorists at the time did not recommend it. Second, even for footsoldiers during this period the armored pikeman still tended to be seen as the more honorable/gentlemanly position. It would have been pretty unlikely to put it mildly for a member of the nobility to actually choose to be a musketeer.

It might be that the image is trying to depict a mounted harquebusier, who did often wear just a helmet and simple breastplate/backplate. However the harquebus and carbine were relatively short, lightweight weapons which did not require a forked rest like the one depicted in the picture, and a mounted harquebusier would be carrying one or two firelock pistols with him, which aren't depicted at all. Also it still doesn't really fit socially or tactically. It would be a bit like saying that the [M26 Pershing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M26_Pershing) evolved into the [HMMWV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humvee).

If you wanted to pick an ""evolution"" of the knight in the early 17th century, why not pick an [actual lancer, or even a cuirassier](https://imgur.com/a/sqED0) (essentially an armored lancer without the lance)? As Bert Hall pointed out if anything it was probably the armored reiter/cuirassier that brought an end to the traditional knight, not musketeers and pikemen. Essentially upper class cavalry just started trading in their lances for neat, expensive wheelock pistols.

Which makes sense since they are definitely the most ""medieval"" of the early modern weapons, but also sort of a shame since they are definitely some of the coolest looking early modern weapons and they still managed to play a significant role during most of the period. While the overall trend tends to be the older, shorter weapons being slowly phased out for the more modern pike it was hardly a straightforward pattern. The success of the Spanish swordsmen at the Battle of Ravenna for example lead Machiavelli to predict a return to roman-style heavy infantry armed with sword and shield. The English bill especially had some fairly extreme highs and lows, going from a decisive defeat of “continental style” Scottish pikemen at the Battle of Flodden to 1622 when the remaining bills in the Tower of London were catagorized among bows, coats of plate, and chainmail as being “of no use for any moderne service”.

George Silver’s *Parodoxes of Defence* written in 1599 divided the polearms shorter than a pike into two categories. The first is the “weapons of perfect length” which includes the half-pike, forest bill, partisan, glaive, and short staff. These weapons were about 8 or 9 feet long depending on the user’s stature and could be used for both thrusting and striking. According to Silver they are the among the best weapons in one on one combat, with the forest bill being the very best. He even goes so far as to claim that a skilled fighter with the short staff has the advantage over two swordsmen attacking at once. The other category Silver gives is “weapons of weight”, which includes battle axes, black bills, and halberds. These weapons he claims are heavier and thus only 5 to 6 feet long to make them easier to handle. They are less effective in single combat (though he claims they still hold the advantage over the two handed sword as well as sword and target) however Silver claims that their weight and shortness makes them far more effective than the weapons of perfect length at delivering blows in battle among multitudes of men:

&gt;Yet understand, that in battles, and where variety of weapons are, among multitudes of men and horses, the sword and target, the two handed sword, battle axe, the black bill, and halberd, are better weapons, and more dangerous in their offense and forces, than is the sword and buckler, short staff, long staff, or forest bill. The sword and target leads upon shot, and in troops defends thrusts and blows given by battle axe, halberds, black bill, or two handed swords, far better than can the sword and buckler.

&gt;The morris pike defends the battle from both horse and man, much better than can the short staff, long staff, or forest bill. Again the battle axe, the halberd, the black bill, the two handed sword, and sword &amp; target, among armed men and troops, by reason of their weights, shortness, and great force, do much more offend the enemy, &amp; are then much better weapons, than is the short staff, the long staff, or the forest bill.

However, I’m not entirely sure how clear this distinction really was. From artwork and surviving examples we know that many halberds and other polearms were relatively lightweight and quite a bit longer than 6 feet. It might be that some of these weapons fit more closely in the category of glaive or forest bill than weapons of weight, or it might be that Silver would classify them somewhere in-between. In general English tactical writers don’t bother to differentiate much between long halberds and short halberds or long bills and short bills. Often they play it loose with types of polearms in general, lumping bills, halberds, partisans, glaives, or half-pikes all together at once.

------

As mentioned, tactical writers tend not to go into much detail about the different types of polearms, and even when they do they generally still lump halberds, bills, partisans, sometimes even sword and target together as “short weapons” when describing formations and troop compositions, suggesting that they are generally expected to fulfill a pretty similar role. 

There was a little discussion about the European halberd compared to the English bill but it doesn’t seem to go very in-depth. Sir Roger Williams mentions that he thinks the halberd is overall the better weapon so long as the head is made from good steel. Humfrey Barwick claimed that the difference was a matter of skill; halberds were better for officers who were well-practiced in their use “But for our common countrie men, not vsed to handle a halbard as aforesaid: I woulde wish him to haue a good strong black Bill.” “Halbards are not to be put in the hands of an igno∣rant person.”

For the most part complaints against the bill were complaints against short polearms in general, comparing them to either the full length pike or to targeteers armed with sword and shield (Machiavelli’s Art of War had recently been translated into English and many of the classically educated writers became similarly intrigued by the prospect of Roman-style infantry returning). On the subject of short weapons Robert Barret wrote: 

&gt;For I know them necessarie for many peeces of seruice; as to performe executiō if the enemie break, or flie; to mingle with shot to back them if neede be; to passe with Conuoyes, &amp; to stand by your Artillerie; to creepe along trenches, and enter into mynes, where the Pike would be ouerlong; **but best for the myne or breach is the Target of prooffe, short sword, and Pistoll: but for the plaine field, neither blacke bill, Hal∣bard, nor Partizan comparable to the Pike.**

-

&gt;Against horse the like reasons are to be made: thus either to offend or defend, farre better is the Pike, then either Bill, or Halbard. And to conclude, the strength of the Battaile is the armed Pike,

 William Garrard claimed that the Halberd was only good for sacking towns or entering houses, and that “in a day of battaile the old Romaine Shield and a short sharpe pointed sword, to execute in a throng of men, excéedes the Halberd and browne Bill.” He also proposed that it might be a good idea to have arquebusiers wear a lightweight leather shield on their back for melee. But I haven’t heard about that ever being followed through. And although Robert Barret spoke highly of sword and shield troops his ideal troop composition was still 50% shot, 40% pike, 7-8% bills and halberds, and only 2-3% targets.

Overall the theme seems to be that the organized pike block has the advantage during the push of pike on an open field. While the shorter weapons are more useful on rough terrain such as a trench, mine or breach and are more useful for pursuing and defending if the formations start to fall apart. Though it might be that in some of these scenarios the ideal composition is better described as small groups of pikemen and shorter weapons working together. According to Roger Williams the chief weapon for defending or entering a breach is still the pike, though it needs to be supported by halberds, bills or targets. Barret’s description of an assaulting column is that the front rank is ideally comprised of targets while the rest of the formation is presumably still comprised of pikes and halberds. Surprisingly, George Silver’s opinion was that the long staff or morris pike were fairly decent weapons in one on one combat, their main flaw being that they are too easily outflanked when facing more than one opponent at a time. 

While “mingling with the shot” is often mentioned as a good use for the short weapons, some writers mention using “light armed pikes” for this as well. Who are pikemen armored with only a corslet and helmet.

Though halberd or sword/target seem to have been popular weapons for officers, a commonly theme reinforced by many writers is that the pike is still “the strength of the battle” and the “most honorable” of the weapons. Often the halberders and billmen were less heavily armed, with full upper body armor being recommended for pikemen, but only a helmet with corslet without vambraces for billmen or even just a coat of brigandine. According to Barwick, leaving off the vambraces made it easier for halberdiers and billmen to use their weapons. Thomas Styward recommended that the tallest recruits should all be armed with pikes, those of more moderate stature should be given bills and halberds, and the nimblest recruits should be given firearms.

In a pike square, the traditional purpose of the shorter weapons was to guard the colors and the officers. Thus they are usually positioned in the center of the square, like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pamphlet.jpg) or [this](http://imgur.com/a/AJ4Dc). There are quite a few other variations described but sadly eebotcp really needs to work on uploading actual illustrations instead of just text. The purpose of this center is so that if the pike formation breaks apart then the billmen etc. can more effectively defend the center of the formation with their shorter weapons where the fighting is the fiercest. The formation may also have been intended to open up once the enemy formation broke, allowing the shorter weapons in the center to persue and execute. However at the end of the century it seems that this practice was becoming somewhat controversial. Robert Barret was strongly opposed to including shorter weapons in the center of or mingling them amongst the pike square and considered the practice largely useless. His argument was firstly that the shorter weapons still can’t stand up to a push of pike and secondly that when a pike square starts to lose, the front ranks of pikemen start to yield backwards, creating such a crush that there is hardly enough room to use anything longer than a dagger, never mind a bill or halberd. Thus he concludes that the formation should include as few short weapons as possible and that they are far more effective mixed in among the shot guarding the wings or among the forlorn hope.

On what Barret considers the best uses for the shorter weapons:

&gt;Conclude not so short vpon me, because I giue them no place within the body of the battell. For if you remember, in our former discourses, at the e∣quall sortment of weapons, I allowed to euery hundred of men 8 or 10 halberds. The which bils and halberds with other short weapons as swords and targets, and long swords, and such like, shall serue as in a place of best seruice for them, to mingle with your naked troupes of shot, and also (placed with some pikes) for the gard of the cariage and munition and ordinance, or for execution if the ene∣my begin to breake and slye, with sundry such seruices not contained in the bo∣dy of the battell.

Although I was reading Taylor's *The Art of War in Italy, 1494-1528* (1920) and he claims that both rotational fire and fire by rank were being used all the way back in the Italian Wars during the early 1500s.

&gt;(p47) At 
Marignano the French arquebusiers and crossbowmen 
developed a continuous and formidable volume of 
fire by discharging their weapons in rotation and 
inflicting such heavy casualties on the Swiss that the 
arquebus may be said on that day to have first 
challenged the supremacy of the pike.

-

&gt;(p51) At the battle 
of Bicocca in the following year the value of infantry 
firearms was first demonstrated on a large scale. The 
front of the imperial army, which was protected by 
a sunken road, consisted of four ranks of arque- 
busiers, mainly Spanish, with German pikemen massed immediately behind them. The arquebusiers were in- 
structed by Pescara to hold their fire until the ad- 
vancing Swiss were at close range; then, when he 
gave the signal, each rank was to shoot in turn and 
to reload in a kneeling posture in order to leave a 
clear field of fire for the ranks behind.

Looking back, rotation of fire seems so important to the use of arquebusiers in large numbers or when defending positions that it seems hard to explain how else they could have continued to grow in proportion among european armies throughout the 16th century without it. Especially when 16th century tactics are already known for fairly deep formations (why else would you put shot in ""sleeves"" of if only the first rank or two can shoot), and long skirmish lines can quickly become very unwieldy (a 3000 man tercio that is just 1/6th shot would mean a 50-man-wide pike block trying to protect a 500-man-wide skirmish line, if the ratio is increased to 1/3 then it becomes a 45-man-wide pike block trying to protect a skirmish line 1000 men wide). It would also explain why the caracole was invented so quickly once cavalry started widely using firearms.

Doing some googling I also came across this translation supposedly attributed to a Spanish soldier who fought in the early 16th century. He seems to describe a method in which arquebusiers come out of a formation one file at a time into a skirmish line, deliver a shot, and then return to the safety of the pikes to reload while the next file copies the process.

An article describing experiments performed with longbow arrows against layers of leather and linen.

Any concerns about the historical accuracy of the bow draw weights or linen weave aside, the results are quite interesting. Against multiple layers of linen the broadhead-type arrows all performed extremely well compared to the bodkins tested, with the widest arrowhead penetrating the farthest. By contrast many of the bodkins struggled to penetrate 16 layers and even the narrow ""needle"" bodkin had its penetration significantly reduced. By contrast, against 3 layers of leather the needle bodkin was able to penetrate farther than the best performing broadhead.

In addition arrow A was initially tested prior to sharpening and was unable to penetrate the 16 layer jack 4/6 times. After sharpening it was able to penetrate several inches. This seems to add some credence to Humfrey Barwick's claim that ""I am of that opinion, that the doubletes vsed in these dayes, are as good a defence against a rustie arrowe, as a Target of the best proofe.""

Overall the results seem to further support the importance of composite armors made of different materials during the middle ages, for instance a layer of mail to better stop sharp broadheads with layers of linen underneath to better stop duller bodkin points.",WarCollege,Arrows against Linen and Leather Armor,https://www.reddit.com/r/WarCollege/comments/553ej9/arrows_against_linen_and_leather_armor/

Because he is undoubtedly a swell guy otherwise I will be focused. entirely on nitpicking parts of a couple of sentences, as is the way here. They concern the author's interpretation of a discourse written in 1594 by English mercenary Humfrey Barwick to was defending the effectiveness of firearms (the harquebus and musket) against the English longbow.

Here's what the article says:

&gt;Barwick only considered the point-blank effectiveness of the two weapons. The harquebus is best because it is the first to fire; the archers must still pull their bows. **While Barwick did not claim that the harquebus had an accurate range greater than 8-10 yards**, he assumed the same range for the bow and dismissed the greater rapidity of fire the bowman enjoyed by saying that the soldier with a harquebus need only put several balls in his piece to have greater fire power.

-

&gt;**One must keep in mind that Barwick constantly compared the weapons with a 12-yard range in mind.**

Barwick didn't think firearms were accurate beyond 10 yards? Wow, for someone supposedly so supportive of the new weapons that definitely seems pretty damning. Maybe we should take a look now that a [full transcript of Barwick's work is online](http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A05277.0001.001?view=toc)

The first passage we run into giving specific range values:

&gt;But to the musket againe: The musketes are weapons of great force, and at this day, bothe with leaders and followers, much feared: for fewe or no Armours, will or can defend the force thereof, being néerehand, which is as well a terror to the best ar∣med, as to the meanest: **it will kill the armed of proofe at ten skore yardes, the common armours at twenty score, and the vnarmed at thirty skore,** being well vsed in bullet and tried powder.

Now hold on here, thirty score is definitely a bit farther than 12 yards. And it does seem as though he might be making a subtle comparison to the maximum range of the bow given that's what his whole paper is about. But whatever, it's not a direct comparison and it doesn't say anything about accuracy so we'll let it slide. Perhaps these are only theoretical ranges anyways.

Is he still only considering point-blank effectiveness here? Strangely enough maybe he is. [Sir John Smythe](http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A12567.0001.001?view=toc) in his book repeatedly used the term ""point and blank"", Barwick commented on this and noted that he hadn't heard that term before and believes it means the same thing as ""point-blank"". Anyways here is how Smythe defines point and blank: "". . . the Mos∣quet ranforced and well charged with good powder, would carrie a full bullet poynt and blancke 24. or 30. scores."" Smythe didn't think that anything would hit at this range but it seems that Barwick is maybe still talking about someone's definition of point blank range in the above passage, so good work.

Anyways moving on for a couple of paragraphs we read this from Humfrey Barwick:

&gt;And whereas it is set down, also by S. Iohn Smith that it is not méete, that any Harquebuziers should discharge or shoot, but within 8. 10. or 12. yards at the most. I wonder what manner of souldier that shold bee, that within pointe blancke of his weapon, be it musket or Harquebuze, that should misse the bredth of a trencher:

Ah, now we get into 8, 10, 12 yards thing, and we get the context. Barwick is responding to a claim by Smythe that musketeers are ineffective against charging cavalry beyond 8-12 yards. Naturally Barwick seems pretty dismissive of the claim, if not outright baffled by it and counters that a soldier would not miss a trencher at those distances. As an aside ""won't miss a trencher at 12 yards"" is definitely a claim that the harquebus had an accurate range greater than 10 yards, just putting it out there.

moving on:

&gt;and these are my reasons which consis∣teth in two pointes. First as touchinge a good and skilfull Cannonier, notwithstandinge that his Cannon dooth recoyle, sixe or eight foote: hee will not faile the compasse of a yarde of his marke, beeinge within pointe blancke: **Secondly the fowler, who dooth shoote without a rest many times, and hath his péece charged with small haile shot, if he be perfecte, wil not faile to kil a Mallard, (yea sometimes halfe a dozen if they sit néere together, or right vpon his leuell) within fiftie yardes. Then much lesse will the skilfull Harquebuzier or Muskettier misse the hit∣ting of a man:**

Alrighty, now we're cooking. We've gone from not missing a trencher at 12 yards to not missing a man at 50 yards. That's definitely a claimed accurate range greater than 10 yards.

We'll skip ahead now past his description various times where he describes seeing both bows and firearms in action, from his early years as a soldier in the 1550s when his commanding officer held a trials 2-3 times per week involving ""all manner of warlike weapons"" to various battles he'd taken part in. I suspect that some of these may have taken place at ranges much farther than 10 yards as well, but lets move on to the 9th discourse where he really starts comparing firearms to bows:

&gt;But this is the effect of the matter. If it must be as Sir Iohn Smith dooth say, that a Harquebuze may not discharge but within 8. 10. or 12. yardes: I think that if that be allowed, that the Harquebuzier may discharge the first, before the Archer, being rea∣dy as afore is said. And if it be at horsemen and the horsemen be so néer as within 10. or 12. yards: then is it too late to charge again, or to shoot, for the hors∣men being so néer as aforsaid, wil either enter or els immediatly retire, with y they haue already recei∣ued: for it is a thing most certain, that horsemen in their charge if they be Souldiers, when they are within danger of the shot, will either not charge at all, or else being neer, will with all possible speed per∣fourme their charge:

A ways into this section here's a paragraph finally that actually seems to fit the original article's claims. If the discourse consisted of only this paragraph without anything else then yeah I guess the article would be a pretty good summary. Just ignore everything past the first two sentences where he seems to allude to the absurdity of a scenario where a gunman or archer is that close to a charging horseman.

Next:

&gt;The Harquebuzier that dooth perfectlye knowe how to vse himselfe and his weapon: will discharge more Bullets, then any Archer can doo Arrowes: and by this way and meane. If it be a Musket, so much the better for my purpose, and this is to be doone in great incounters, whereas armies cannot marche but easilye, for that the numbers are great, and being a Musket, **I would firste deliuer a single Bullet, at 24. score off** or there abouts, by that time they had marched fourescore neerer, I would deliuer another Bullet, and at 12▪ score two, and at eight score three, at forescore 6. Pistoll Bullets, with lesse pouder thē at the first by the third part, for alwaies the more lead the lesse pouder, and yet shall the force be neuer the lesse.

&gt;**Now consider, that betwixt eight score and the ioyning of the battell, how many arrows can a bow well deliuer?** for within that distance, both the bat∣tailes dooth come on with great speede, or else not at all. But no man can tell how to fight, but as the time, the ground, and the number shall either giue leaue or suffer.

Now we get a description of Barwick's proposal for a more ""realistic"" imaginary battle. At this point he's cooled down from 30 score slightly but he's still pretty clearly comparing bows to muskets at ranges much farther than 12 yards. In fact the the shortest range he mentions shooting his musket at here is 80 yards. This assumption that he's thinking about everything in terms of extremely short ranges pretty clearly doesn't hold up. Assuming the ""near shooting"" comparisons in his mind are taking place at around 50 yards or more actually causes his claim that the bow shoots ""by guess"" and the firearm shoots ""by rule"" to make more sense. Because it starts to become more important for the bow to estimate range than firearms at a distance.

But this is all still sort of implied isn't it? How accurate does Barwick claim the arquebus is really? Well:

&gt;And wheras it is further set downe in the same Booke, that Harquebuziers may not giue their vol∣lyes of shot, but within 8. 10. or 12. yardes, and not 8. 10. or 12. skores: &amp; that archers will hurt, wound, gall and sometimes kill, at 9. 10. and 11. skore, as well as the fiery weapons can doo.

&gt;To this I say, that for triall thereof, **I will stand at six score yardes distant** from the best of these Ar∣chers aforesaid, and let him shoot 10. arrows one af∣ter another at me, and if I doo stir from the place, let me be punished, and I wil be armed as before is said of the Pistoll proofe, and if I be therwith wounded, I am contēted to take my mends in my own hands: **and againe, let me be set in the same place** where this lustie Archer stood to shoot his ten arrowes, **and let there be a whole complete armour set right vp where I did stand**, and **let me haue but two shootes with a Musket or Harquebuze,** and let it then ap∣péere, what the one and the other is in force or cun∣ning, this in my opinion were no harm: and it were not amisse that triall were made, for it is supposed by many that haue read Sir Iohn Smiths booke, that there néedeth no Pikes to garde the Archers, for saith he, they are Pykes good enough of themselues.

So there you go, 6 score or 120 yards being the maximum range he thinks he can reliably hit a man-sized target. But hey, being off by a factor of 10 isn't really that bad is it?

Edit: Back to the original article. It claims Barwick said that an expert ""with a harquebus could discharge only once every 40 seconds"". Can anyone tell where exactly Barwick says this? In the first discourse he mentions an instance where he offerered to demonstrate shooting 40 times in one hour with an arquebus, which would be one shot every 90 seconds. There's also maybe some statements you can reverse engineer to get rate of fire (he says that a musket can be reloaded in the time it takes the enemy to *march* 80 yards or in the time it takes them to *row* 160 yards while the arquebus can be reloaded in the time it takes them to *row* 80 yards), but he doesn't seem to come out and say ""40 seconds"" exactly.",badhistory,"This week on ""Don't trust everything you read just because it was published in the 1960s""",https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/4zyx7c/this_week_on_dont_trust_everything_you_read_just/

Skirmishing has obviously been around for long before the invention of gunpowder. But what I'm wondering is if it gained a completely new definition after guns were introduced? There were some people who seemed to claim that guns could fight in a very different method than earlier weapons. For instance this quote from the Roman god Mercury in 1574:

&gt;Besides this euery Bushe, euery Hedge, euery Ditch, euery Tree, and lamost euery Moalhil is a sufficient safgarde for a shotte, where the Archer is little worse, but on a playne, when the shotte wyll conuay them selues into euery couerte, that the Archer shall not see whereat to shoote, and yet hee himselfe remayne a fayre marke for the other, or els can use no seruice.

-

&gt;. . . the Archer must remaine an open mark uppon the plaine or els to occupy his Bow to smal efect.

Assuming a good marksman really could hit a single man at 80-120 yards it seems like even matchlock firearms would have been pretty well suited to skirmishing: the high speed of the projectile makes it harder for targets to move out of the way, estimating range correctly becomes less important, and they could be loaded with pistol bullets or hailshot in order to achieve a shotgun effect if needed.

In Keith Roberts' *Pike and Shot Tactics* he mentioned that Sir James Turner, in 1648, was opposed to the Scots army invading England through Lancashire for the sole reason that the dense hedges and many ditches in that area would give a significant advantage to the better trained English musketeers and prevent the Scots from closing to melee easily.

Some writers from the late 16th century like Roger Williams wrote that a musket with good powder was deadly at up to 600 paces, Humfrey Barwick recommended taking the first shot with a musket at around 480 paces and mentioned that gunmen knew how to estimate range of distant targets and adjust their aim to account for bullet drop. John Smythe on the other hand wrote that firearms were useless past 20-30 paces.

For the late 18th century, [this article](https://allthingsliberty.com/2013/08/how-far-is-musket-shot-farther-than-you-think/) claims that the ""point blank"" of a musket was considered to be about 300 yards. Which seems to fly in the face of stories from that period of entire companies opening fire at 100 yards and missing every single shot, as well as claims that musketeers would hold their fire until they got within 50-100 yards of the enemy.

So I guess my question is what was the reality in combat generally like during the early modern era? Were these larger numbers just theoretical maximums widely ignored by experienced commanders, or would battlefields usually see armies firing volley after volley at extremely long ranges hoping to wear down the enemy? Did the average initial engagement range change over time between the age of pike and shot vs the napoleonic wars? Did range vary depending on how experienced the troops were, for instance more experienced gunnmen shooting effectively at very long ranges and less experienced ones being told to hold their fire?

This is a treatise he wrote in order to use his military experience to set the record straight about the effectiveness of firearms compared to bows. In particular he wanted to correct those in England who still held that the bow was superior, such as Sir John Smythe.

[A more English Translation of the first 9 discourses](http://the-norseman.livejournal.com/13230.html?nojs=1)

The following is me trying to transcribe all the main points he makes pertaining to guns vs longbows:

-The harquebus requires a lot of training to use properly, many English do not trust it yet because they are not yet used to the weapon.

-The Spanish have a great deal of yew, if the longbow was that the spanish would have adopted it by now.

-The English are overly attached to the longbow due to their history and culture.

-Most of the great longbow victories Sir John Smythe lists happened over 200 years ago.

-In the past battles usually devolved into melees, now they are usually decided at range with positioning and fire.

-Noble men can't understand the effect of weapons as well as common soldiers do. Particularly those who use firearms since those professions are considered beneath noblemen.

-An instance where Captain Brode claims a harquebuser can fire only 10 shots an hour, Barwick offers to demonstrate firing 40 shots in that same amount of time.

-If loaded properly with good powder, a musket will kill a man in proofed armor at 200 yards, common armor at 400 yards, and an unarmored man at 600 yards.

-Sir John Smythe's concerns about bullets not being properly sized to their weapon or the powder/match getting wet are not a problem if skilled soldiers are using the weapons.

-If the weather is so wet that everything gets damp then it is also a disadvantage for the other side. In this case the soldiers can either wait it out or engage in melee.

-Responding to John Smythe's claims that the longbow was uncomparibly more accurate than firearms, Barwick points out that he two practiced with the longbow until he was 17 and was a good shot, but after 4 or 5 months of practice with his harquebus he believed he could shoot more accurately than the best bowman in England.

-A gun can be more easily aimed and steadied than a bow or crossbow, especially with a stand.

-Sir John Smythe claims that harquebusers would never shoot at a target more than 8, 10 or 12 yards, Barwick counters that no skilled soldier would fail to hit a target the size of a dinner plate at that range

-All soldiers know how to judge the range of a target and adjust their sight accordingly.

-Barwick claims he has never seen anyone slain outright by an arrow and only a few by crossbow quarrels, but has seen 20,000 killed by gunshots.

-Barwick describes a conversation with a french soldier where he tries to defend the strength of the longbow, the frenchman in unimpressed since even the weakest man with a firearm is more powerful than the strongest archer.

-When Barwick attempts to defend the longbow by bring up its hail of arrows, the French soldier responds that he only need to tilt his head forward to protect his face and he has nothing to fear from the arrows.

-Barwick discusses the siege of Lieth in which 448 English soldiers were killed. When he asked how many of the defenders were killed by arrows he learns that there were none over the course of the entire siege, except for one man who was still recovering from his wound.

-A loaded firearm may be fired more quickly than a nocked arrow may be drawn and loosed.

-If musketeers really did wait until 8-12 yards like Sir John Smythe claims, then they would not have time to discharge their weapons against charging cavalry.

-There is no archer who can shoot more than 2 arrows for every 1 bullet from a well trained harquebuser.

-Musketeers can deliver their first volley at 480 yards, and then deliver another volley every time the enemy has advanced 80 yards.

-Bowmen cannot start shooting until the enemy is within 160 yards.

-A gun will deliver more bullets with greater force than a bow can whether in the short term or the long term. At close range the harquebusers may load an extra shot into their weapons and fire two at once.

-At close range, firearms are aimed by rule, while bows are aimed by guesswork.

-while guns sometimes misfire, Archers frequently become stressed and fail to draw their arrows back all the way.

-If an archer is not well fed or has stiff joints from sleeping in the cold he can become too weak to draw his bow.

-in wet weather, the glue on a bow and it's arrows may dissolve.

-firearms are far more feared and 100 men are killed by them for every 1 killed by arrows.

-arrows rarely kill, and only wound in the face and unarmored places.

-Sir John Smythe claims that arrowheads are left to rust so that their wounds become infected, Barwick admits to seeing many archers with rusty arrowheads, but says that rusty arrows cannot penetrate even a padded doublet.

-England's lack of skilled musketeers makes it vulnerable to invaders.

-Humfrey Barwick proposes a challenge where the best archer in England stands at 120 yards and shoots 10 arrows at him before he returns fire with 2 shots from a musket or harquebus.",history,Humfrey Barwick's Arguments in favor of Muskets and Arquebuses over the Longbow (1592),http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/3g7uzn/humfrey_barwicks_arguments_in_favor_of_muskets/
