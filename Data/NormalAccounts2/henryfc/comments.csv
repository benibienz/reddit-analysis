Yeah, this would be ok if the delay wasn't so long. I mean, it is supposed to be a simulcast. I suppose a good number of people ended up watching the fansubs anyways, but this sucks because it probably still alienated some people who choose to only watch anime legally.

Anyways, I hope they don't have this delay for the future Noitamina shows because there's going to be some hyped up and good shows that will be exclusively streamed on Amazon.

&gt; It is 2016. Matoi Sumeragi, a second-year junior high school student, works part-time as a shrine maiden at Tenman Shrine in the city of Kamaya. Ever since being separated from her mother in early childhood, Matoi has been entrusted to her grandparents on her father's side, but three months ago, she finally began to live with her father Shingo. In those circumstances, she only wishes for a peaceful, normal life.
Her close friend and part-time workmate Yuma Kusanagi is part of the family of the shrine's chief priest, and is a candidate to be the successor shrine maiden. For generations, her family has performed exorcisms of evil spirits. She invites Matoi to one of these exorcism ceremonies, a so-called ""Divine Possession"" that she will attempt.

&gt; One day, Matoi and Yuma walk from the school to the shrine as usual, but when they arrive, they are greeted by the shrine's now damaged grounds, and Yuma's parents have both collapsed from their wounds. Matoi's father Shingo, a police detective, launches an investigation, and he comes upon a man who does not seem entirely sane: his only witness. When he holds down the man, Yuma begins the ritual of Divine Possession.

&gt; Something strange then happens, not with Yuma, but with Matoi. Matoi Sumeragi, who had only wanted a normal, peaceful life, takes the role of a god, and gains the power to banish evil spirits! To get her precious everyday life back, Matoi must conduct exorcisms!

46,"This game looks pretty interesting. [Here's some information](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/54kq11/sundered_official_announcement_trailer/d82te60) from /u/Wabak, [one of the programmers for this game](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/54kq11/sundered_official_announcement_trailer/d82s3m5):

&gt; The game is not a pure metroidvania and draw a lot of inspiration from games like Rogue Legacy and Left 4 Dead. The world is partly procedural, the whole world and interconnections is static, but smaller section are made by stitching handcrafted rooms together. Diablo 2 is a good example. The goal is that in a play-through you'll replay a section a few time and then progress in the game due to stats/new abilities. That progression is kept by enabling shortcuts and new entrances.

&gt; The combat is event/horde based, where we hope to create a up/down tempo and tension, similar to what Left 4 Dead achieved. As this was the best aspect of our previous game Jotun, we also kept a strong emphasis on the boss fights.

&gt; There are three vectors of character progression in Sundered.

&gt; The first one is the abilities you'll obtain by progressing in the game. This is where the metroidvania descriptor come from.

&gt; The second one is a huge skill tree where you'll be able to upgrade various minor and major element of the character. See thing like health/shield/armor/damage/stamina and less generic one such as drop frequency/crit/shield downtime, etc.

&gt; The third one is perks that you can equip. Those will be obtained in challenging optional parts of the game and will be build defining. One example would be removing your shield (regenerating healthbar) but granting you lifesteal. You'll obtain more perk slots as you progress.

&gt; The game will also allow you to trade some of your sanity to permanently corrupt one of your ability. For example trading your dash for a short range teleport. The corrupted ability is always stronger but come will affect the story you get. This is where the tagline Resist or Embrace comes from.",2016-09-26 21:05:15+00:00,d836dky,1.0,t3_54mwh1,204.0,metroidvania

His relationship with his adoptive family is strained, and he has difficulties interacting with his fellow high school students. Meanwhile, his professional career has entered a slump.

On the other hand, what matchups are generally bad for him? Also what would you guys rank him as a mid and as a support compared to the other champions? What did you guys think of the rework that he got? Was it enough to make him more viable or does more need to be done to address his issues? My friends said that he has mobility issues and he doesn't really have an optimal (in terms of gold) build path compared to other champions. Hopefully in the future when AP items are changed again, he'll have more optimal AP items to use if it's still an issue? I know that it might already be a bit better compared to before when they changed the build cost for some of the items that he uses though. He does have his HP % passive which can be pretty useful. Also what are your favorite Brand skins? I suppose it's probably Zombie Brand because of the theme and since it's a legendary skin. It's definitely my favorite skin but I usually use 2nd favorite skin, Spirit Fire Brand more now since Zombie Brand's auto attack seems to be/feels slower compared to all the other Brand skins. It affects my csing and auto attack trading. :/ I've done my research and people said it's a bug that Riot never fixed for some reason. One of my friends said it just feels slower (I suppose it could be part of the zombie theme) and that I just need to get used to it. I've played a lot of Brand though and I just can't get used to it. :/ It has been a while since I've actually played League though so maybe Riot has addressed this but I have a feeling that they probably haven't.

I remember some group released speedsubs for the first episode and the script quality was subpar. I'm not sure if the website used that because I didn't watch that fansub release. Bakemono's are the best available subs for now as they have the best script, typesetting, and chapters.

If you check the seven seas you can see that a different group is still releasing fansubs too at a decent pace, it's just their font for some typesetting titles don't look as good. I know they both also have the ""attack move""  kfx too.

But for fansubs in general, they still have their place for having better typesetting, an improved script, chapters, subbed OP and ED with karaoke effect) (some simulcasts have subs for them but a good amount still don't because the simulcast don't have a license to the song), and a better encode if it's available. Also people don't like hardsubs so some people watch fansubs to avoid having to watch hardsubs.

But generally the simulcast subs are good enough now for the majority of people and people have less and less free told to spend on working on fansubs so they're not as prevalent.

Of course there are situations like Macross Delta, Netflix series (delayed release of subs), and OVAs.

There's usually a big difference between the official subs that come with the Blu-ray too compared to the fansubs. But I suppose that just depends on who licenses it. Blu-ray and DVD releases in countries that aren't Japan seem to have a later release date. Since most people have already waited 6+ months (if they didn't see it in a theater or if the nearest theater of too far away), they'll just watch the fansubs when they are out. Generally the fansubs have a better script and typesetting anyways if they're released from a trustable source.

Oh and there are still groups that fansub Naruto, they just don't it from scratch and they're not as well known/they're newer so they don't have a trusted status on one of the seven seas.",2016-09-14 13:58:44+00:00,d7mdolm,1.0,t3_52q9fl,4722.0,anime

100,"Well, the first thing we have to look at is the Blu-ray and DVD sales. [The first season sold an average of 7,228 volumes.](http://www.someanithing.com/series-data-quick-view) That's pretty decent. Decent enough to warrant a 2nd season. However the 2nd season (Magi The Kingdom of Magic) [sold an average of 2,885 volumes](http://www.someanithing.com/series-data-quick-view). That's a big drop. [Here's what the owner of the website had to say about this:](http://www.someanithing.com/2426)

&gt;  *Finally* it’s been put out of its misery. Seven consecutive sub-2k volumes in this interminably long release of a second season, including 5 volumes that sold &lt;10% of season 1 volume 1. Of course the adaptation did its job by moving shit-tons of manga, but man the nose-dive it took in anime sales is nuts.

Checking /r/magi's [Anime and Manga Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/magi/comments/22etbt/magi_anime_and_manga_guide/) it seems like the 2nd season was pretty faithful. So maybe it was just too fast paced and it left out too many details for people to want to support the releases again or maybe other anime was a higher priority for them.

Anyways I hope it does happen but usually sequels require more sales to warrant one. Also last month the mangaka said [the manga is halfway through the final arc](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-08-04/magi-manga-is-halfway-through-final-arc/.105004), which started in October last year. Since the anime is supposed to be an advertisement first it would have to happen in a season before the manga ends then. It's a shame it's not running in Shounen Jump where Blu-ray and DVD sales aren't the main factor for sequels.

I do hope it happens but at least the spinoff got a TV adaption. It's nice to see at least some of the cast animated although I miss many of the other characters from the main series. If it doesn't happen I guess I'll just pick up the manga from where /r/magi recommends. I've already waited this long so I don't have a problem with waiting longer since I have other anime and manga to catch up on or watch if they're new too.",2016-09-12 21:33:32+00:00,d7k4by0,1.0,t3_52gi0f,3808.0,anime

Well I think [Tetsuya Kawakami](https://myanimelist.net/people/28577/Tetsuya_Kawakami)'s character designs aren't bad. It definitely makes the characters look pretty cute. I liked his character designs for [Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin] (https://myanimelist.net/anime/21561/Ryuugajou_Nanana_no_Maizoukin_TV) and [Shigofumi](https://myanimelist.net/anime/3420/Shigofumi) too. A-1 Pictures' adaption of the manga should be good since [Takao Yoshioka](https://myanimelist.net/people/14787/Takao_Yoshioka) is [writing and overseeing the scripts.](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-09-04/interviews-with-monster-girls-demi-chan-wa-kataritai-tv-anime-main-staff-revealed/.106094) It should be fine as long as he follows the manga like he did with Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso and the many other anime (which mostly seems to be ecchi) that he was previously associated with.

Anyways [the premise of the manga seems pretty good](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=114717), it definitely seems like the interactions between the succubus, dullahan, and vampire are going to be fun to watch.

People can still debate if an anime of a different genre is objectively better too although the MAL score doesn't really matter since it's just an average of ratings. What matters more is the reasons that a person comes up with their objective score, which then equates to a rating of their own scale of the MAL scale of they choose to follow it. But yeah most people here at least seem to take the MAL rating of a series with a grain of salt.",2016-09-10 01:14:08+00:00,d7gfq1w,3.0,t1_d7gedpn,2200.0,anime
126,"The interview location is unfortunate but the interview itself is actually pretty good. We learn that they have actually written 5 drafts of something with her family and that they just don't actually have the space to include them in the story/scripts especially since there are many series regulars. We also learn that Rose Mciver is friends with Melanie Lynskey and if Liv ever does an episode that has her use her natural New Zealand accent it'll involve Melanie. It's cool that they've already tried but so far they still have scheduling conflicts. That's understandable, she's a busy actress.

The story about the Rob Thomas event was pretty funny. I'm surprised that he hasn't met him face to face at the set though. It's cool to see that the other Rob Thomas is such a big fan, although I would say it's not too hard to be one given how well received iZombie is. It's the combination of the talented actors and great writing.

I'm still kinda sad that we have to wait to January to see the 3rd season to air while the other CW shows are starting their sequels in October. I suppose they can only have so many shows but it still sucks. At least there are other good shows to watch but there's nothing that can really fill the void of not having iZombie to watch.

I've heard many great things about it and that it's Makoto Shinkai's from /r/anime so far but that's just hearsay although there's probably truth in that statement. I think the only people that have actually seen it is if they've seen it in Japan or at the Anime Expo. When more people see it's probably going to go down. It might stay in the top spots or so but there always seems to be outliers. Plus it's possible that people who rated it so far have a different scale than other people in the future. In the end that's definitely going to be true, but the movie generally does seem to be received pretty well from what we have heard so far.

In the end the MAL rating is just an average of ratings, but I suppose people want two things:

1. They want the MAL rating to reflect their own personal rating as much as possible.
2. They want the MAL rating to reflect an objective rating which is probably alos their own personal rating too.

I suppose people also want to actually have a legit top list of anime that they agree on. That's understandable, but the format of movies are pretty different from TV series though. Eh, [MAL does have tabs to separate movies and TV series](https://myanimelist.net/topanime.php) so I guess that's one way to address the differences. I mean it's the best way, but I just personally wouldn't compare a TV series vs a movie.

* Arlsan from Arslan Senki

* Tanukichi Okuma (MC) from Shimoneta
* Su-won from Akatsuki no Yona
* Azuma Kazuki (MC) from Bubuki Buranki

He and Inori Minase (Rem) are probably going to keep their spots for the final result. It's nice to see my other favorite male seiyuu on the list. Same thing for Kana Hanazawa, and Saori Hayami on the female side.

I suppose [Yumiri Hanamori](https://myanimelist.net/people/21543/Yumiri_Hanamori) is there because of her performance as An Hanakoizumi from Anne Happy♪. She also did a great job voicing [Chiaya Misono](https://myanimelist.net/character/115321/Chiaya_Misono) from Rolling☆Girls last year!

And [Shiina Natsukawa](https://myanimelist.net/people/23405/Shiina_Natsukawa) is there because of her performance as Akeno Misaki from Haifuri (High School Fleet). She also voiced Lemrina Vers Envers from the 2nd Season of Aldnoah.Zero.

Well it'll be interesting to see what changes when the final result is released. I have a feeling that some of the movies might change their spots.

Also [Satelight](https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/41/Satelight) is #1 there for producing Macross Delta. Maybe there are some Momokuri fans too? I am looking forward to watching [Nanbaka](https://myanimelist.net/anime/30016/Nanbaka) in October because of it's premise and because it's directed by [Shinji Takamatsu](https://myanimelist.net/people/5152/Shinji_Takamatsu) who previously directed the first 105 episodes of Gintama, Gintama Movie: Shinyaku Benizakura-hen, Sakamoto desu ga?, Daily Lives of High School Boys, School Rumble, and Ixion Saga DT.

Apparently it's really lewd so  it might more fitting for an OVA release, but there are TV channels like AT-X which airs anime uncensored.

154,"Well, it's just rushed to the point where they need to get to X point by the time that the 13th episode ends. Of course, it would be best it was a complete adaption of every manga chapter/panel but they have to make compromises to reach that point when they are limited to being 1 cour. At least we're getting the max number of episodes that can happen under 1 cour. When the anime rushes its adaption for the particular episode, usually people in the /r/anime threads point out what wasn't adapted and then they list the manga chapter or panel so I just check that out.

If you take a look at how much the first season sold, [it sold an average of 2,016 volumes.](http://www.someanithing.com/series-data-quick-view) That's pretty subpar, [however since the manga is released in Shonen Jump the main factor for having sequels is the manga sales. Apparently they increased so we got a 2nd season.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShokugekiNoSoma/comments/3k0uji/sns_season_2_compromised/cutula0)

Anyways, I feel like maybe since the anime had subpar sales the production committee decided to reduce/limit the 2nd season to being 1 cour. Perhaps there was a different factor that influenced their decision though, I can't really be sure. I know people have told me there's a lot of content that they can adapt so if my theory is true, as long as manga sales stay consistent or improve [\(this is still happening as it just ranked #2 last week\)](https://myanimelist.net/news/47672967) then we should still be getting future seasons, albeit limited to being 1 cour. But this also depends on how long the future arcs are and if it could fit to being limited to 1 cour too. I'm not a manga reader yet so I don't know.",2016-09-08 16:27:06+00:00,d7ed58d,1.0,t3_51rtzn,3812.0,anime

156,"Yeah MAL actually emails you when a show on your PTW starts airing in Japan. Of course, usually the simulcast will have a delay of sorts but it's still a useful and good reminder.

Personally my favorite website to use for keeping track of upcoming anime is [Senpai.moe](http://www.senpai.moe/?season=fall2016&amp;mode=table) because of its features, table option/interface, and MAL integration. It's currently not updated but I think the creator is just bust right now and I'm sure he'll begin to update it once Crunchyroll and Funimation announce which series they plan to simulcast. It shows you how much of a simulcast delay that a show will have and you can actually change the status of a show too for your MAL account (like adding it to your PTW).

As for the service I use to keep track of the anime I watch, I use [Taiga](http://taiga.moe/). It basically automates the process of saying that you've watched another episode of an anime or started one. It's compatible with watching anime that's from the seven seas and from legal simulcast services like Crunchyroll. [However, unfortunately it doesn't seem like it has Anilist support now though.] (http://taiga.moe/#faq-services) Perhaps it will support it in the distant future. Also it can notify when new anime releases are available, although the way it does is associated with torrenting/sailing the seven seas. I personally don't use it because I usually go to a place that puts mirrors of the files on filehosting services. I prefer to use that place because it's the fastest way to get that file since I use an [internet download manager.](https://www.internetdownloadmanager.com/) I also like to check the comments of a release sometimes to see if it's decent enough to watch it's from a new fansubbing group or I know multiple fansub groups plan to sub the series. Since there are times where different people work on a fansub the quality of a fansub can vary from the same fansub group. There are certain times where I'm actually waiting for a release for certain anime and when that's the case I just go to their IRC channel and wait to see the release there.

The other website I like to use is [livechart.me](https://www.livechart.me/fall-2016/tv). You can customize the theme of the website and the timezone too. The creator is pretty consistent on keeping things up to date and is actually probably one of the first people who knows when anime is going to premiere since he seems to follow the anime series on Twitter.

There's also [Anichart.net](http://anichart.net/fall). It's interface seems to look a bit better but you have to hover over the anime series to see the actual date and time of the premiere. On the other hand, you can customize which anime database (Anilist, MAL, or Hummingbird) you want to associate the website with in the options and then you just need to click on the anime's key visual to go to its profile. It's a little bit easier than what livechart.me does since it's a bigger area but Anichart also just lists all of them at the bottom of each anime entry.",2016-09-08 14:03:36+00:00,d7e6je7,1.0,t3_51rb52,1847.0,anime

165,"They haven't really started to announce which new shows that they're simulcasting yet. Crunchyroll announced that they're simulcasting Nanbaka and Funimation announced that they're simulcasting Drifters + the Monster Hunter anime. These are the only new anime that have has simulcasts announced already. I personally hope Crunchyroll will be able to get the license for it because Funimation still hasn't delivered on their promise for switching to softsubs/fixing their oversaturated video. They said they were going to switch in May and then they said they'll switch in September. Granted, I suppose they could switch later during the last week of September after all the Summer shows finish airing. Even then I prefer Crunchyroll also because their translation seems to be more consistent in terms of the style that I prefer for honorifics and the basic typesetting that Crunchyroll provides is nice/better than what Funimation does. They translation also just seems to be more consistent in terms of quality too usually.

[But it looks like there's ~45+ TV shows](http://www.senpai.moe/?season=fall2016&amp;mode=table) (excluding a show that wasn't licensed during it's first season) that need to be licensed so it's understandable if they don't get it since other anime could be a higher priority for being licensed. Although the premise and fanservice will probably make a lot of people to want to see it so maybe it'll have a decent priority for having a good bid to license the anime. The same thing goes for Funimation though. Plus they seem to always have at least one ecchi show licensed too every season. I suppose it also depends on how much money they each have to spend on bidding for anime licenses for the fall season and how many translation staff they have too. We'll just have to wait to see.

174,"So the English title of this movie is ""Tekuteku Days"" if people are planning to create a MAL entry for this or have more information in the future to submit about it. Here's a synopsis of sorts that's [from the Facebook page:](https://www.facebook.com/tekutekudays1983/)
&gt; ""Will I be showing you around the city？""
&gt; Story occurs in Yuzu_cho, old town in Tokyo.
&gt; Yuki is a girl who lives in Yuzu_cho. She meets Miwa, a girl who moved from Kyoto in western Japan.Yuki gets to be showing Miwa around Yuzu_cho.
&gt; Suddenly they become closer. Yuki looks cheerful, but Miwa perceives that Yuki is anxious about something in her mind.
&gt; Yuki has an anxiety that she can't tell anyone.

Here's some information that I also found from the Facebook page about the main characters of this movie:

[Yuki Shudo](https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/dimension=450x1024:format=png/path/se20f56283e39b762/image/i4ef77e7fa8107b9d/version/1454430068/image.png) 

* [Yuki](https://www.facebook.com/tekutekudays1983/posts/909731522397185) is 13 years old girl who lives in old town called Yuzu_cho. Koshiro, her grandfather, has restaurant called ""kamado _neko"" in Yuzu_cho.
Since she was a child, her father works far away from their home. Also her mother works as chief editor of magazine. Through busyness of her parents, grandfather takes care of her. Yuki is used to handle with elder people because she helps grandfather's restaurant since her childhood. Yuki is very good at associating with other people. She is cheerful and has many friends. In contrast with her sociable disposition, she has a frailty in her mind.

[Miwa Nojima](https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/dimension=450x1024:format=png/path/se20f56283e39b762/image/i69de53e0005f23eb/version/1454430075/image.png) (voiced by [Suzuna Kinoshita](https://myanimelist.net/people/27643/Suzuna_Kinoshita))

* [Miwa](https://www.facebook.com/tekutekudays1983/posts/912337782136559) is a girl who moved to Yuzu_cho from Kyoto. She is thirteen years old as same as Yuki.
Miwa is honest and stubborn. She doesn't afraid to speak exactly what she feels to others. Her father is the famous architect. Miwa's parents lives separately because of her father's affair with woman.
The reasons why she moved to Yuzu_cho are devorce and second marriage of her father. While her parents' absence, Miwa is leaved to the temple in Yuzu_cho temporary. At first she looks very depressed due to the stress moving to unknown place. Through their trip in Yuzu_cho, suddenly Miwa gets along with Yuki.

[Tomoko Yamada](https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/dimension=450x1024:format=png/path/se20f56283e39b762/image/ib37993b41a192e72/version/1454430084/image.png)

* [Tomoko](https://www.facebook.com/tekutekudays1983/posts/918786604825010) is the best friend of Yuki since her childhood.
 She is youngest daughter of Yamada meat shop in Yuzu_cho.
 She is dynamic girl, and she takes ballet lesson since she was a child. She is very straightforward, but sometime she behaves like spoilt child to her elder sister.
Tomoko is cheerful and behaves to be beloved of all. By the way she behaves, some people feels she is affable to everybody.
By a certain incident, Tomoko and Yuki are not getting along as well as they used to.

Yuki is voiced by [Kaori Mizuhashi](https://myanimelist.net/people/156/Kaori_Mizuhashi) who previously voiced:

* Mami Tomoe from Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica

* Michiru Matsushima from Grisaia no Kajitsu
* Ougi Oshino from Hanamonogatari
* Irina Avalon from Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm
* Hime Granzchesta and Ai from Aria
* Minami Shimada from Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu
* Chika Ogiue from the Genshiken series
* Miyako from Hidamari Sketch
* Yuuno Scrya from Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha

I think it would be cool to highlight series that's on your PTW list (with a different color) too though because I know some people decide that they want to watch something if one of their favorite voice actors are in it. There's also people that are just influenced more to see something if one of their favorite voice actors is in a series that they haven't seen too, even if their also interested in the plot and/or animation. I suppose you could make this optionable, but I think as long as the other color fits well with the yellow and white it should be fine.

For some series it doesn't seem to highlight it if you've seen them. Examples include [Yuki Kaji](https://myanimelist.net/people/672/Yuki_Kaji) [for Tokyo Ghoul √A and Zetsuen no Tempest.](http://i.imgur.com/BnvcRjH.png) It's strange because as you can see, it highlights the first season of Tokyo Ghoul but it doesn't highlight the 2nd season. I'm not sure if other cases exist though.

&gt; I still like the other voices on the english dub better, but it's honestly not as big of an improvement as some people are making it out to be. It just depends on whether you want a more energetic/not as serious sounding Spike (dub, which I think fits the character slightly better) vs. a more laid back/bit more professional sounding Spike (sub).

However, there were many people that talked about Steve Blum's performance. So since it seems like the majority of people watched the dubbed version of Cowboy Bebop, I thought that most people wouldn't recognize him/his voice as Spike.

184,"Interesting, this is the first time I've heard of Studio M2 before. I'm surprised that there aren't any recent articles about the creation of that studio. The only information I can find is[ from /a/](https://desuarchive.org/a/thread/143573547/). 

&gt; Maruyama Masao, founder of Madhouse and MAPPA, is creating a new studio, called M2.
&gt; According to someone who attended Maruyama's panel at Animazement this year, he says his health is degenerating, and expects he has 3-5 years left to live. Therefore this new studio is to be dedicated to making the projects of his dreams. [This is corroborated by this interview](http://gigazine.net/news/20160521-garo-df-masao-maruyama-interview/) where he says there are some projects he wants to make sure will happen, even if he won't be able to see them to completion. 

I wish someone would translate that interview. If this is true, it is unfortunate to hear him say that. In any case I hope he'll OK as long as possible and I hope the 2nd season of Shirobako will happen during that time so he'll be able to see the character that was influenced by him. [Hopefully Tsutomu Mizushima will eventually not be occupied with directing other anime so this can happen.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3cot4p/there_will_be_no_shirobako_season_2_because_the/)

[There's also this other comment from /a/](http://boards.4chan.org/a/thread/146201897/rip-satoshi-kon#p146214752) that's more recent, but there's no source for what he said. I suppose it's just an intepretation of some Japanese news because I also can't find any English articles about the president position change
&gt; 
&gt; Maruyama is no longer directly running MAPPA. He made producer Ohtsuka Manabu president, and while he's regularly going to the studio, he wants to let the young people take the lead.
&gt; He intended to slowly go into retirement, but in the end couldn't stand stand still and created another studio, called M2. He says he has 2 big, ""only Maruyama would do this"" projects he intends to make before retiring. He expects it'll take 5 years for those to be completed, and that he will only have the energy to work for another 2 or 3, so he's working on building a base for them, so younger producers can take over when he's gone.

I wish I could find more official sources of information about this. Oh and [Shigeyuki Miya](https://myanimelist.net/people/10578/Shigeyuki_Miya) also directed [Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou](https://myanimelist.net/anime/21405/Bokura_wa_Minna_Kawaisou).

209,"[The sidebar has a link](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/legal_streams_/_downloads) to a good list of other streaming services. For simulcasting Crunchyroll and Funimation usually are the two websites that have the most anime series. However, if you choose to watch anime using Funimation's video player the anime will be oversaturated until they switch to softsubs from hardsubs in September. (They were supposed to switch in May before.) Sometimes there are a few series that are exclusive to Daisuki or Hulu. [Oh and for now Amazon Prime Video will have at least one exclusive show each season.](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-03-17/amazon-signs-deal-with-fuji-tv-to-exclusively-stream-noitamina-series/.99901) For the ongoing season and recent seasons [I'd check out Senpai.moe because the interface is nice and color coded.](http://www.senpai.moe/?season=summer2016&amp;mode=table&amp;air=stream)

So that's it for legal streaming services. There's a lot of illegal ones out there but they're usually low bit rate hosts of fansubs/rips. If you ever decide to not use the legal way to watch a show I'd recommend to find the original source/fansub by sailing the seven seas. I'd say it's most important for certain series that are made by studios that improve/fix the animation with blu-ray/if the legal stream is censored. Or if the legal stream's script quality isn't good. There's also typesetting, I think having signs that have typesetting make it more enjoyable in a way (especially if the show is heavy with typesetting).",2016-07-20 10:47:00+00:00,d5je7w1,1.0,t3_4tqirz,991.0,anime

Also it's possible that they might have more time to work on the other episodes of they're reusing the majority of the stuff that they created for the OVAs, so that's another bonus too. I personally am fine with this because this is basically a full adaption of the manga while the OVA adaption wasn't since it skipped some chapters. I also find it nice that I can now enjoy/watch the series in 720p.

Interesting, they're really committing to the people who have an interest in this kind of anime. Well, based on the amount of censorship that's shown [in the PV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-ujni_7xk4) it would probably be better to watch the Blu-ray version where it's uncensored/doesn't have that kind of censorship. I mean, I know that generally it's always better to watch the Blu-ray version as long as there are improvements made with the animation and/or there's censorship in the TV broadcast/simulcast, but in this case I think that kind of censorship makes it worth to wait for watching the subbed version of the Blu-ray release.

&gt; The ""cross-dressing romance"" centers around Ai Shizukuishi, a shy, plain girl with not-so-great grades and a secret. She posted videos of her dancing in male clothes onto Smile Dōga (an homage to the real-life streaming service Niconico Dōga, which literally means ""Smile Video""), and she became a viral hit. Ai aims to beat Hayate, the ""godly"" ""prince of dance"" on Smile Dōga. However, her cross-dressing dances happen to catch the eye of an entertainment agency, so she makes her professional debut — in an idol unit with Hayate. On top of that, the two have to share quarters under the agency's rules.

This will be a 3-episode TV Anime and it'll star [Asami Shimoda](http://myanimelist.net/people/1696/Asami_Shimoda) and [Nobuhiko Okamoto](http://myanimelist.net/people/270/Nobuhiko_Okamoto), who has voiced:

* Accelerator from Toaru Majutsu no Index &amp; Toaru Kagaku no Railgun S

* Karma from Assassination Classroom 
* Rin Okumura from Ao no Exorcist
* Jurai Andou (MC) from Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de

His voice it sounds pretty distinct to me, if you've seen him voice some of these characters you probably recognized his voice.

So the synopsis sounds pretty interesting and unique to me. I mean, it's just kinda rare to see a girl cross-dress as a boy in an anime and it's even rarer to see the plot of the story relate to it. I like the animation too and I like to listen to Nobuhiko Okamoto voice characters so I'll watch this if someone plans on subbing this. I'm not sure if any company would simulcast something like this though.

&gt; When a stray black cat named Kuro crosses Mahiru Shirota's path, the high school freshman's life will never be the same again. Kuro is, in fact, no ordinary feline, but a servamp: a servant vampire. While Mahiru's personal philosophy is one of non-intervention, he soon becomes embroiled in an ancient, altogether surreal conflict between vampires and humans.

Well, for me I'm looking forward to this because I enjoyed some of Brains Base's previous anime, I find the synopsis interesting, and I know that[ Servamp is going to have some notable seiyuu](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-01-31/servamp-tv-anime-1st-promo-reveals-july-premiere/.98190) like [Yuuki Kaji](http://myanimelist.net/people/672/Yuki_Kaji), [Yoshitsugu Matsuoka](http://myanimelist.net/people/11817/Yoshitsugu_Matsuoka), [Ayumu Murase](http://myanimelist.net/people/15919/Ayumu_Murase) (Shouyou Hinata from Haikyuu/Wowick from Gangsta), [Suzuki Tatsuhisa,](http://myanimelist.net/people/735/Tatsuhisa_Suzuki) and[ Yuuki Ono](http://myanimelist.net/people/1154/Yuuki_Ono) who has voiced: 

* Shogun/Shigeshige from Gintama

* Shirou ""Alsiel"" Ashiya from Hataraku Maou-Sama
* Masayuki Hori from Gekkan Shouji Nozaki-Kun
* Zenkichi Hitoyoshi from Medaka Box
* Taiga Kagami from Kuroko no Basket

I find them notable because I enjoyed it when they voiced some of their characters. Sometimes its the way they sound while other times they have had some memorable scenes as that character before.

Also, it seems like people have a positive reception of the manga [on Mangaupdates](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=63885). (While there's only a few chapters that are scanlated, there are more that have been officially translated from Seven Seas.)

314,"Well, people who buy physical releases of anime do it to support the industry in hopes of being part of the numbers that warrant a sequel and to get the other perks that come along with it. It costs a lot of money to produce anime and it also costs a lot to buy physical releases too. If an anime wants a sequel it needs sell thousands and thousands of Blu-ray and DVD volumes, at least if it's success is mainly dependent on those sales. There are times where if it generates enough of an increase of sales for the original source that it's adapting (LN/manga), then that can be enough. There are also some cases where the TV ratings factor more if it airs during the day. Anyways, the average Blu-ray and DVD sales need to be somewhat high to warrant a sequel. Plus in Japan, they're usually released in volumes consisting of 2 episodes. They do it to also own the release that's in the best quality since sometimes the animation studios fix/improve the animation when it's appropriate. Some studios, like Shaft and Ufotable, are known to make very notable and numerous changes too.

Supporting simulcast services does support the anime industry too but it doesn't really factor as much as buying physical releases in warranting a sequel due to the cost of producing anime and due to how much profit they gain from these simulcast services compared to buying physical releases.",2016-03-22 21:51:54+00:00,d19owf3,7.0,t1_d19mcwf,3591.0,anime

&gt; Japanese developer and media company Dwango announced that it has acquired animation production software Toonz from Italian developer Digital Video, with a forthcoming release of an open-source version containing the same feature sets as the Toonz Ghibli Edition developed by longtime Toonz user Studio Ghibli.
&gt; 
&gt; Toonz Ghibli Edition is a customized version of the Toonz software which was developed by the famed Japanese studio and has been used in the ink and paint, color design and digital composition process for most of their titles ever since *The Secret World of Arrietty.* In addition, OpenToonz will also include effects developed by Dwango that utilize its artificial intelligence technology, and a plug-in feature that enables anybody to add original effects to OpenToonz. The new open-source software -- which is completely free to use and update -- will be officially presented in Tokyo at Anime Japan, running March 26-27.
&gt; 
&gt; “During the production of *Princess Mononoke* in 1995, we needed a software which enables us to create a certain section of the animation digitally,” Atsushi Okui, Executive Imaging Director, Studio Ghibli, commented. “We checked for what was available at that time and chose Toonz. Our requirement was that in order to continue producing theater-quality animation without additional stress, the software must have the ability to combine the hand-drawn animation with the digitally painted ones seamlessly. From then onwards we continued to use the software while going through major updates to make it easier for us to use. We are happy to hear that this open-source version contains the Ghibli Edition. We hope that many people inside and outside of the animation industry will utilize this software for their work. We would like to extend our gratitude to the staff of Digital Video.”",2016-03-20 08:04:46+00:00,d16jst6,1.0,t3_4b6msw,6643.0,anime

&gt; In the video, Makoto and her cat familiar Chito are having tea. Makoto says that it's too bad she's been able to get any good mandrake to make tea, since that's the norm, but she instead prepares three kinds of tea: plantain, dandelion, and horsetail. When Chito asks Makoto which tea has magic-strengthening effects, she tells the cat that plantain tea helps regulate stomach activity, dandelion tea relieves fatigue, and horsetail is used for detox, so all of them help in powering up magic because a healthy body can produce powerful magic. In the end, Makoto wonders if she can eat the plants raw. When she tries it, she comments that it tastes like grass.",2016-03-18 20:41:04+00:00,d14ykdu,2.0,t1_d14vt28,4019.0,anime

&gt; 
A next-generation, wearable multi-device that looks like a pair of small headphones. In terms of size and portability, it is far superior to the existing VR machine “Amusphere.” Augma doesn't have a full-dive function, however, its AR function is greatly enhanced to compensate for it. It can transmit visual, audio and tactual sensation data to players while they are awake, thus enabling the users to enjoy fitness and health management like a game.

And here's a description of the ""Ordinal Scale"" game [from the website:](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-03-13/aniplex-usa-streams-sword-art-online-the-movie-ordinal-scale-english-trailer/.99730)

&gt; “Ordinal Scale,” an ARMMO-RPG that was designed exclusively for “Augma.” Following its release, it has become the most discussed game due to its advanced technology. In this game, players can raise their rank by collecting items that appear in various places in the real world and by defeating monsters. This “Ranking System” is the main feature of the game, and in this system, each player's status is determined by their rank which is indicated by an ordinal number instead of a cardinal number. As the result, high ranking players are given overwhelming power and often rank has become a major factor in deciding the outcome of a PvP battle.",2016-03-13 07:27:53+00:00,d0y11al,1.0,t3_4a7ewh,2599.0,anime

Here's a synopsis [from MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31764/Nejimaki_Seirei_Senki__Tenkyou_no_Alderamin) if anyone else doesn't know what this will be about:

&gt; At war with the adjacent Kioka Republic, the Katjvarna Empire.
&gt; 
&gt; In that region, due to certain circumstances, there was a certain youth unwillingly preparing to take the High Grade Military Officer Exam. His name, Ikta. Disliker of war, lazy, admirer of women.
&gt; 
&gt; No one predicted that that kind of Ikta would later on become a soldier referred to even as a great commander...
&gt; 
&gt; He who survived a world embroiled in war with his superior genius, Ikta. Illustrating his dynamic, dramatic life, a splendid fantasy military history, the curtain is raised at last!

This will be adapting the LN, [which seems pretty well received on mangaupdates](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=113541). The dynamic between the main female character and the main male character [seems refreshing/pretty unique](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/49rok9/nejimaki_seirei_senki_tenkyou_no_alderamin/d0uacm9) (They trust each other and [there's no romantic feelings between them/they have a platonic relationship.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/49rok9/nejimaki_seirei_senki_tenkyou_no_alderamin/d0uh35n)) The male MC is also apparently [a womanizer and he has a things for MILFs](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/49rok9/nejimaki_seirei_senki_tenkyou_no_alderamin/d0uxh3t?context=10000), interesting.

[Shogo Yasukawa will be handling the series composition at Madhouse](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-03-11/alderamin-on-the-sky-anime-staff-july-premiere-revealed/.99656).

It looks like they'll have a good source to adapt and I believe Madhouse will make a great adaption too!

I haven't read it, but sometimes things can differ in a manga adaption. I was recently reminded about this when I read one of /u/Aruseus493's comments about a manga adaption of a LN in /r/anime. Anyways, I can't specifically say myself because I haven't read the manga yet but I feel like it's possible the manga changed or added something that made you dislike it. Perhaps this isn't the case for you, but I say this based on the [LN's ratings on mangaupdates](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=113541) compared to [the manga's ratings on Mangaupdates.](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=110715) Then again, it's probably not the case for you since you said it ""blows"". You probably think it deserves one of those very negative ratings. Either way, it's not like Madhouse is going to have their anime adaption based on the manga adaption of the LN.",2016-03-10 06:37:02+00:00,d0ug3t5,3.0,t1_d0ucxuk,6735.0,anime
339,"Sweet! Here's some relevant info [from](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3nficp/nejimaki_seirei_senki_tenkyou_no_alderamin_anime/cvnl41a) /u/n2o1990 that I found interesting when this anime was announced: 

&gt; ""The mighty Katjvarna Empire is currently embroiled in a war with the neighboring Kiorka Republic.
&gt; 
&gt; Within an unspecified corner of this empire, a certain young man was reluctantly preparing to take the High Grade Military Officer Exam owing to mysterious circumstances. His name is Ikta.
&gt; 
&gt;  As a man, Ikta abhors war, is slothful by nature, and worships the female form.
&gt; 
&gt;  At the time, no one could have possibly predicted that a person like him would become a military figure worthy of being called a legendary general......
&gt; 
&gt; The young Ikta, armed with his superb talents as a soldier, struggles to survive in a world ravaged by war. This tale will recount his tumultuous life up until this point, as the curtains are drawn for a spectacular chronicle of fantastical warfare!
&gt; 
&gt; MC is milf fucker anyway, i mean he actual fuck them.

and here's some more relevant info [from](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3nficp/nejimaki_seirei_senki_tenkyou_no_alderamin_anime/cvnnizr) /u/Lem_201:

&gt; First volumes has 6 main characters. 3 males and 3 females. The main female is more of the mc's ""best bud"". They trust and use each others, no romantic feeling there. She knows how much he went out with women in his school life (including with maried women in their 40s lol) and she absolutely doesn't care. Honestly in the first volume, she could have been a male, no a single scene would have changed. 
&gt; 
&gt; It's not for military otaku like Gate. It's military due to medieval strategies taking a lot of importance, you won't see tanks helicopters and the like here, that's a medieveal fantasy with a touch of magic (magic being restricted to 4 type of spirit so the use is codified/following precise rules).

Based on what these two redditors have said, [the LN](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=113541) seems pretty interesting. There's also [a manga adaption too](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=110715). Anyways, I look forward to watching another great anime adaption from Madhouse!

Also they said this for episodes and series that have been released:

&gt; We will be re-encoding most of the, if not the entire, library in order to move to soft subtitles, though. Therefore, that possibility could be discussed at that time provided we have materials.

So going by this, it's not fixed at the moment since it just recently launched. It'll be fixed when they switched to softsubs ""soon"". The question is how soon, is soon?

374,"Sweet! I look forward to watching this over [the next four weeks!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/32491/Kanojo_to_Kanojo_no_Neko__Everything_Flows) It's always nice to hear Kana Hanazawa voice a new role. I also like it when cats play a major role in anime, it's cool to see them animated and how they're involved with the plot of the story. I think my interest with seeing them animated grew more after I learned the process that animators go through to animate cats from watching Shirobako.

&gt; Chuuta Kokonose is an orphan who lives with his aunt. For as long as he can remember he's had a voice in his head, but other than that he's been a normal boy—right until the day when a strange thing follows him home and teleports him to a place filled with even more fantastic creatures. It's a police station in space. 
&gt; 
&gt; Surprisingly, Rein Brickke, the Chief of the Solar System Department, tells him that their computer chose him as a potential candidate for the solar-system's police force. However, Misuzu Sonokata, a girl from Chuuta's school with an angelic face and ill temper who turns out to be one of Rein Brickke's subordinates, doesn't think Chuuta is suitable for such a job. 
&gt; 
&gt; Although Chuuta was shocked at first, he decides to take the aptitude test after being urged by the voice in his head. Most importantly, he wants to prove Misuzu wrong.

Nice! They're releasing 4 episodes per day? Interesting! I'm glad these episodes will focus on [Takebayashi](http://ansatsukyoshitsu.wikia.com/wiki/K%C5%8Dtar%C5%8D_Takebayashi), but I wonder what other chapters will they cover too with this kind of format. I mean do they plan to cover every single skipped chapter? I guess we'll just have to wait and see. I suppose it's possible if they don't skip a big arc.

Also I wonder if Funimation will sub this since it's not premiering on TV. Well, even if they don't hopefully fansubbers will sub these shorts. First someone has to rip the raws from the streaming site.",2016-02-29 03:16:01+00:00,d0hmg1d,1.0,t3_487w3v,2402.0,Korosensei
401,"Both, but the main reason is that they're not done with animating the rest of the episodes. (Also, PVs always only show content from the first episode.) You should watch [Shirobako](http://myanimelist.net/anime/25835/Shirobako) to see and understand the whole process. I highly recommend it since it gives you a great insight towards the process and hardships that's related to creating anime. It's also a great comedy and drama. Anyways, [here's a sample production schedule from Shirobako.](http://i.imgur.com/xRVd3xW.jpg) [This image explains the terms that are used in that schedule.](https://i.imgur.com/P8033rt.jpg) As you can see, it takes ~14 weeks or so to finish animating a single episode. It can be chaotic too since jobs are often outsourced to other animation studios because there's too much work or not enough staff. This is why I truly appreciate animation studios like Bones that are usually consistent since that means they are able to meet their deadlines. Also, if I see a still or face that looks mediocre I understand why the animation studio would let that happen.

A traffic accident brings his disappointingly brief life to an end … or it should have, but he wakes up and sees a beautiful girl who introduces herself as a goddess. ""Hey, I have some good news — would you like to go to an alternate world? You may only bring one thing you like with you.""

With that, he is transported to another world and his great adventure subjugating the demon king begins … but first the hard work of finding food, clothing, and shelter begins. Kazuma wants to live in peace, but the goddess raises one problem after another, and then the demon king's army has its eyes set on him.

We'll just have to see how consistent the sales stay for future volumes.

What you said is probably true for most, if not all, of the other anime though. Which is pretty sad since some of them have been good adaptions/anime.

426,"Thanks! I also prefer the fansub version! [Here's HorribleSubs' version of the scene on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXcsnFbo9Iw) The ""Geo Risotto"" part is just a romanization of the Japanese words that she spoke. I think she said ""メタルギアリゾット"" which literally means ""Metal Gear [Risotto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risotto)"". In this situation, I prefer the fansub's choice of localizing it because it's more apparent that its meant to be a parody on ""Metal Gear Solid"". Although, I suppose literally translating it as ""Metal Gear Risotto"" would've been okay too. Also, I just looked it up and apparently the fansubs was based on their own translation.

Localizing versus having a literal translation is a common debate for people. I think it just depends on the situation and on how much of an extent a fansub localizes the translation. The most important thing is getting the meaning of the phrase/sentence to the viewer because sometimes if a fansub chooses the other choice, the meaning of the phrase/sentence is lost.  Its just depends on the situation.

Also the amount of localizing depends on the staff that is actually involved with fansub. Some fansubs are known to localize their translations more, but generally there's only a correlation if some of the same staff are working on the anime that the viewer is watching.",2016-02-19 22:55:46+00:00,d06fxkb,4.0,t1_d06cipa,5207.0,anime

One thing that's different now that has a negative side effect is that they disabled the feature to say that a review is not helpful. They did this because apparently some people were brigading reviews they didn't like. They have stopped that, but as a side effect you can't say a review is not helpful anymore and that can be bad because some reviews might have point or multiple points that are irrelevant. I mean, it's all opinion but some people make points that can easily be rebutted.

Anyways I suppose it doesn't matter if you don't actually use MAL review as a decision on whether or not to watch an anime since there are better reviews out there from certain YouTubers or people on /r/anime (from their [WT!] threads, but some people use it since they don't know better or since they haven't seen some of the great [WT!] threads or reviews that certain YouTubers make.

As for MAL ratings, just take them with a grain of salt. A lot of people don't use the full scale. Some people know of it and know that they should use it, however they started watching and rating anime at least for a couple of years already. It's hard for them to proper re-evaluate anime when they can't remember every factor that factors into their rating. Sure, they could just review their new/future anime with the full scale but then they think that when they compare/people compare their ratings for their previous anime that didn't use the full scale to the ones that do, it would be really troublesome and probably create false ideas to other people. I mean it would just be inaccurate when someone makes a statement ""in your MAL list you rated X (an anime with using the old scale) with this rating, but you rated Y (an anime with using the full scale) with this rating""...

There are also people that are upset about people that overrate anime or don't use the full scale, so they purposely rate an anime with a low rating to ""balance"" it out.",2016-02-14 23:05:49+00:00,d001awx,1.0,t3_45tcv8,2304.0,anime

It's too bad that the Blu-ray/DVD sales were so poor. If I ever get around to reading the LNs that weren't covered, I'll definitely try my best to read Fremy's parts in her voice! (Well, I mean I'd try to imagine her reading Fremy's parts.) I would also do the same thing for Adlet Mayer!

If anyone is interested in seeing upcoming/future anime that has her as part of the cast, then they should plan to watch [My Hero Academia](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-01-14/my-hero-academia-anime-casts-aoi-yuki-ryou-hirohashi/.97542, as she'll voice Tsuyu Asui) in April.

I could be wrong though.

Also if anyone doesn't know the synopsis, [here's one from Crunchyroll:](http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2015/08/21/netoge-no-yome-wa-onnanoko-ja-nai-to-omotta-anime-cast-announced)

&gt; The story centers on the protagonist boy Hideki Nishimura who fell in love with a female character in an
&gt; online game in the past, but only found out that her player was actually a Nekama (male player who pretends
&gt; to be a woman). After having the painful experience, one day, another female character confesses her love to
&gt; him, and her player Ako Tamaki is a real bishoujo girl! But he soon learns that she has a serious communication
&gt; disorder and can't even distinguish reality and online. Can Hideki and his ""Guild"" friends save her?

I know I've included it in the previous thread regarding this anime before, but it's pretty obvious that this key visual will gain more attention from people than that other article.
As for my personal opinion on the key visual, I think their eyes look nice. They way it's drawn reminds me of [the eyes that the characters have in KyoAni's anime.](http://i301.photobucket.com/albums/nn62/kensuka/Mazui_Hyouka_-_17_4DD6ED44_Aug132012121908PM.png) I understand it's most likely that they won't be as detailed as those eyes since [Project No.9](http://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/439) isn't KyoAni, but I still like how they look.

&gt; The story centers on the protagonist boy Hideki Nishimura who fell in love with a female character in an
&gt; online game in the past, but only found out that her player was actually a Nekama (male player who pretends
&gt; to be a woman). After having the painful experience, one day, another female character confesses her love to
&gt; him, and her player Ako Tamaki is a real bishoujo girl! But he soon learns that she has a serious communication
&gt; disorder and can't even distinguish reality and online. Can Hideki and his ""Guild"" friends save her?

&gt; The story centers on Hideki Nishimura, a young man who confessed to a person he thought was a girl online, only for that person to turn out to be a boy. He keeps this ""black history"" secret and swears to never to trust a ""girl"" online again. However, one day a girl online confesses to him, and it turns out she's actually a beautiful girl named Ako Tamaki. Ako cannot tell the difference between the online world and reality, and she is a loner who has trouble communicating. Hideki and his friends from his guild decide to work together to ""correct"" her.

Anyways I've heard it's really funny and entertaining, so I'm hyped.

SAO it not as bad as Fairy Tail. What's mainly bad about it was the 2nd arc. I've also heard a lot of praise and hype about the upcoming future arc! It's also possible that my opinion is more positive than others because once I heard because I was watching a fansub for season 1 (for better translation, OP/ED subs, chapters, and typesetting) and they had some delays for whatever reason. I then somehow heard about all the bad things about the 2nd arc, or rather that it just wasn't as good as the first arc.

&gt; The light novel series centers around Kizuna Hida, who visits the strategic defense academy Ataraxia at his big sister's request.

&gt; Hida Kizuna possesses the HHG (Heart Hybrid Gear) ability, but it is not strong enough to make him particularly important. His older sister calls him to transfer to a strategic defense school, where many of the students (many of which are large-breasted girls) use their HHG abilities to fight invaders from another world while wearing extremely skimpy pilot outfits.

Her father is the mayor and isn't at home much, and she lives with her elementary school-aged little sister and her grandmother. Mitsuha has an honest personality, but she doesn't like the customs of her family's Shinto shrine, nor does she like her father participating in an election campaign. She laments that she lives in a confined rural town, and yearns for the wonderful lifestyle of living in Tokyo. Taki is a male high school student who lives in central Tokyo. He spends time with his friends, works part-time at an Italian restaurant, and is interested in architecture and fine arts. One day, Mitsuha has a dream where she is a young man. Taki also has a dream where he is a female high school student in a town in the mountains that he has never been to. What is the secret to their dreams of personal experience?

&gt;  * Only the blu-ray version of Glue's release for episodes 1-10 for Gintama° are available atm

Other bonuses include typesetting/better typesetting, chapters, and lyrics for the opening and endings of Gintama.

673,"You should watch Rumbel's subs, they subbed episodes 21-165 and episode 202-203. I don't think they subbed the first 20 episodes as Shinsen-Subs was subbing each episode at that that time. Oh and the torrent you linked doesn't include the latter ones so I'll PM you one that does. While it's nice that/r/Gintama is lenient on these things I just feel better if I follow ""standard protocol"". Anyways for episodes 165-201, you should start watching RG Genshiken's subs. They are just actually Crunchyroll's subs but it'll give you the best viewing experience since they muxed Crunchyroll's subs with the DVD. For episodes 204-265 I suppose you can just watch Horriblesubs. However, starting with episode 1 of Gintama°, you should watch pyrorinnegan's release ([Glue]). His release will give you the best viewing experience as he adds great/accurate typesetting, chapters, and the OP/ED lyrics. He also releases the blu-ray version when it's available. Also, you don't know about the movies and the watch order right? Make sure to substitute the first movie for the Benizakura arc. I forgot which episodes they were atm, but I know it's on /r/anime's wiki.

Also, recently people have been uploading the raws of the blu-rays for the older episodes on Nyaa. So one person took their time to mux Rumbel's subs for episodes 152-155 to the blu-ray raw. It's on nyaa as [NotRumbel].

Summary:

* Shinsen-Subs: 1-20
* Rumbel: 21-165, 202-203
* Horriblesubs: 204-265

&gt; The story of the manga revolves around Yuki Kurihara, a girl who has finally been granted her wish of dating her crush Shinya Momotsuki (Momo). At first glance, she just looks like a normal but very cute girl. However, she is in fact a maniac over Momo, taking notes of his activities and never missing the chance to see him in a cute moment. Momo, on the other hand, is inexperienced in love, and just wants to make Yuki happy.

And here's [info for the staff:](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-11-11/momokuri-romance-comedy-anime-2nd-promo-introduces-characters/.95242) 

&gt; Yoshimasa Hiraike (Amagami SS, Kaleido Star: New Wings, AKB0048) is directing and heading series composition for the anime at animation studio Satelight (Log Horizon, Macross Frontier, The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan) with producer Fumio Kaneko (AKB0048, Log Horizon) also on the project. Miwa Oshima (Baka and Test - Summon the Beasts, GJ-bu) is designing the characters and serving as chief animation director. Lantis will produce the music.

[](#rengehype)

ANN said that the anime will premiere this winter on the Comico manga app though, so I wonder if it'll still be simulcasted by a service like Crunchyroll.

&gt; The popular ""alternate world home comedy"" centers around Kazuma Satō, a hikikomori (shut-in) die-hard fan of games, anime, and manga. A traffic accident brings his disappointingly brief life to an end … or it should have, but he wakes up and sees a beautiful girl who introduces herself as a goddess. ""Hey, I have some good news — would you like to go to an alternate world? You may only bring one thing you like with you.""
&gt; 
&gt; He responds, ""…So, I'll bring you."" With that, he is transported to another world and his great adventure subjugating the demon king begins … but first the hard work of finding food, clothing, and shelter begins. Kazuma wants to live in peace, but the goddess raises one problem after another, and then the demon king's army has its eyes set on him.

&gt; **I've been removing them, but I'm going to bring this up as a discussion for the mods. I'll leave this one up.**

In the past, when [people posted dishes that was recreated from an anime, it gets removed because the mods are very strict on what counts as being ""anime related"".](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3i1b7w/i_recreated_ayumis_omurice_omelet_rice_from/) Although /u/TheKappaOverlord speculated this:

&gt; I don't really know, mods are weird with their rules sometimes.

However, you can see in  /u/Atashi's history and from the thread (there are no ""other discussions"") that he didn't x-post it from a different subreddit. I hope the mods have came to a conclusion that all recreations from food from anime are definitely anime related. Sure, some may be lower quality while others might be higher quality but leave it to the Redditors to decide whether or not it's worthy of being on the front page.

Well, most people ""give back"" by subscribing to simulcasting services like Crunchyroll and/or Funimation. Then there's people who will buy physical releases like blu-ray volumes, manga volumes, LN volumes. The same people also buy merchandise (usually figures). I guess some people actually buy hug pillows and mousepads too.

You have to realize though, when you give back by subscribing to those services you're mostly just helping them out. Sure, they give a percentage back to the anime industry in Japan but it's so miniscule compared to buying Japanese blu-ray volumes. A single volume can cost $300. A second season requires thousands and thousands of revenue from blu-ray volumes because it's very expensive to make anime.


Honestly I've never supported the industry directly, I've only done it indirectly. I mean I spread the word a lot about products, services, and anything that's related to anime or manga.

I thought the animation and OST was great! Although I was surprised that they're using a live-action actor to voice its MC.

&gt; **Actually, it is likely split cour unless it changes airing stations. That's because Heavy Object will be taking the time slot for the show for Fall. Its second station on the same day is also getting replaced by another show. [The BD for the first 12 episodes is also accounted at 6 discs for 2 episodes each.](http://www.gate-anime.com/bd-dvd/index.html)
What this also concerns is if Heavy Object may be a 1 cour. I highly doubt that Gate will just be a single 1 cour though so we'll see this week.**

Someone else also noted that it's also [going to be replaced by Shinmai Maou no Testament Burst on AT-X:](http://www.crunchyroll.com/forumtopic-871779/gate-anticipation-and-discussion?fpid=51492661)

&gt; And for those that question the Heavy Object / Gate time slot discrepancy, the AT-X airing of Gate also stops at episode 12 and is replaced by The Testament of Sister New Devil: BURST on 10/10, with no other Gate listings the rest of October.

LN readers speculate that the 8th volume needs to released to complete the latest arc and Madhouse just needs to not be busy with making great adaptions of other anime, like Overlord.

Assuming Madhouse finishes a 2nd season of Overlord first, they'll probably have time to make a 2nd season of NGNL afterwards!

Ah, it took you months to create that? That makes sense, there's a lot of intricate detail in each part of the fanart.

1008,"Crunchyroll is the best legal streaming site, while that site is the best illegal streaming site. Overall the illegal streaming site hosts subs that are better quality and lists the source of what they're streaming too. I know they replace their streams with better subs when they come out. They even replace the episodes with the blu-ray version when it's available on the seven seas. You can also download it directly. I also found out that there's a script that you can install so you don't have to disable adblock/ublock.

Crunchyroll is getting better though, in terms of translation quality. Or it's been like that for a long time. They seem to be more consistent, anyways compared to Funimation. I hear they are adding basic typesetting too? Maybe they're just placing the text next to signs, at least? [ Another thing to note is this:](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2b26ou/im_kun_gao_the_cofounder_and_ceo_of_crunchyroll/cj12ltp)

&gt; We are the only major streaming service to revenue share subscription revenue (in addition to ad revenue). when a viewer watches more of a show, more of their subscription dollars will go towards that publisher based on minutes viewed... so watching more of your favorite shows directly contributes to what Japanese studios receive.

Now, in general this is a good thing but if you watch a lot of shows then it could be the opposite. In reality it doesn't matter as if you compare the revenue that's gained and also required from buying blu-rays to support a season 2, it's like on a whole different level. Supporting Crunchyroll is more about supporting them so they can make more lucrative bids and outbid Funimation. Same thing goes for people who support Funimation, although they don't share subscription revenue like how Crunchyroll does.

If Crunchyroll provide basic/good typesetting that the rips provide I'm sure a decent amount of people would start to support it. I think this applies more to Funimation, as it's video is always oversaturated. It's not meeting the standard that other subs provide.

As for me? I honestly sail the seven seas. Sailing the seven seas guarantees you'll get the best subs and no blurriness from re-hosting the video.",2015-09-06 00:09:16+00:00,cus01cd,2.0,t1_curzdo0,1345.0,anime

Sometimes it goes well, a decent amount of anime sell more than they need to warrant a 2nd or 3rd season. Others frequently have abyssal sales. It's really a tragedy for those  anime/creators of the manga or LN. One good example of this was 	Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de, which only had an average of
1,188 sales. It defintely deserved more than that and a second season would need 5-8 times the sales it got. Sometimes Japan's taste is truly shit.

&gt; A lot of people are asking if this is any good, and I am a fan of the light novel. It's not too terribly exciting of a series, but I do feel like it is slightly better than its other fighting school counterparts (Blade Dance, Unbreakable Machine Doll, Kenshin no Keishousha, Absolute Duo, Rakudai Kishi, etc.).
&gt; The novel is centered around a setting where 6 schools participate in a fighting tournament with three parts: a pairs tournament, a groups tournament, and a singles tournament. The schools are not completely different, but some of them have an emphasis in research, holy power, etc. Each portion of the tournament has prizes (pairs &lt; groups &lt; single), and the overall winner gets a wish granted. Each single participant usually has a goal that they want to accomplish, and our MC wants to find his missing older sister by participating in this tournament, whether he wins or not.
&gt; The novel excels in that each character is motivated to win, the battles are very close, and the main characters are pretty smart and competent without being overpowered. There is also a lot of politics/beneath the surface dealings between the 6 schools and the overseeing government above the schools, and the top brass of each school/the government are all strong and sly, which is the top reason why I enjoy this series. It isn't as detailed and profound as the politics of Mahouka, but this series does have a Mahouka feel to it, where the student governments (or at least the top students) play a heavy role in the story.
&gt; I definitely recommend the series, and thanks setsuna86 for TLing it.

1124,"Well, it's easier to focus on the subs if the font and typesetting aren't ugly or bland. Fansubs usually solve that by having better font and typesetting. You'll have to sail the seven seas to usually find them. If you watch anime from a streaming site that isn't Funimation or Crunchyroll you're technically already are though. However, some of those sites could still be using those subs. [Another reason to stay away from Funimation is because their videos are always saturated on their website.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2wl2zu/my_experience_subscribing_to_funimation/corxvl2) Examples:^[\[1\]](http://imgur.com/a/zkroY) ^[\[2\]](http://imgur.com/a/Lhxzq) It's fixable if you don't watch if from their website but if you do that you might as well watch fansubs. Also, if you're watching anime that's been out for a long time, it's always better to watch the fansubbed blu-rays. Or you could wait and buy ones from your local region but it also takes more time for them to be released. 

Anyways, while there are a few good dubs you'll also eventually learn to appreciate the Japanese voice acting more. You'll do that because you'll be amazed with how some voice actors can change their range of their voice. Sometimes you won't even know it's the same voice actor if you don't look the anime up on MAL.

I guess you should just tell me/PM me the names of the anime you want to watch subbed and maybe later I'll be able to help you out.

1161,"It's always a worry for people because they don't want to be attracted to a man that is crossplaying as a woman. Which they have every right to do so, although one could say they're attracted to the character that they're cosplaying as. But technically that attraction is for the person who's doing the cosplaying too. In the end I think it's fine as long as people don't take it to the next level, in terms of ""indulging"".

Also, OP and I already provided proof that it's a she when we linked her [cosplay profile](http://worldcosplay.net/member/Rutocy) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Rutocycosplay).

I guess I also didn't Reddit much at the time so I didn't know about how other people felt about those two episodes. Another factor probably was that I like to follow the 3 episode rule. Anyways, /r/Gintama will probably be able to give you a more detailed answer on how often serious arcs happen in the anime. I'd say it happens fairly often but there are times where it's just comedy after comedy. There's also semi-serious arcs too. Recently I think there are more serious arcs though, and I think Gintama's serious arcs are the best because the writing is really solid. This applies to most of the other comedic arcs, but with serious arcs the OST and writing really makes it great!",2015-08-30 12:25:53+00:00,cukoix1,1.0,t3_3itblf,114209.0,anime

1166,"Yeah I'm the guy that usually posts the source of cosplay that gets posted to /r/anime. It's very obvious when people just crtl-c crtl-v cosplay from pictures that they find from their social media. Recently it's just one person that posts cosplay that he finds from VK, a social media website. Other people have posted cosplay from Facebook.

On the other hand, I'm also that guy that who posts OC cosplay. I have a lot of OC cosplay that I have gathered over time, but I still need to find the direct URL for each of them. This can take from 45 minutes to 1 hour and 30 minutes for each character. One example of this is the [Albedo and Momonga Cosplay](http://imgur.com/a/H1DhJ) that I posted. If I add the time that it took to gather each picture it would be a total of several hours. If I see one good picture I'll always give 110% to find every single good shot/picture that is available. This ends up making the total amount of pictures for each album to be from 7-25. I've planned to post OC cosplay of character(s) from: 

* Rokka no Yuusha

* Gate: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri
* Gintama
* Himouto! Umaru-chan
* Durarara!
* Gangsta
* Ore Monogatari
* Kill la Kill
* Knights of Sidonia
* Bakemonogatari

For most of these I still have to try to find every single shot that is available on the internet. Now most, if not all of these albums will be like my Overlord cosplay album. 90-95% of the cosplay I find are cosplay that you can't find from searching blog sites or social media. All of them require searching that Japanese names of each character/anime. A lot of pictures can't be found with just searching that too so you have to look at photographers' pages. Most of them are always from multiple sources. I also don't know Japanese so I can't type it out. I guess all of this adds to the amount of time that's needed for me to gather each picture for the album.

I would've posted most, if not all of these by now if the other people didn't post their crtl-c crtl-v cosplay. Also I don't know about banning them, especially since it can take some time to see for the mods to know where the source of each cosplay is. I would know... Some of them don't actually show up when you google the picture at first, it only shows up in one of the descriptions for the picture on the internet. But those posts should definitely be self posts, at least.

However I understand that even it's obvious that I spend a lot more time and I don't crtl-c crtl-v cosplay from social media, it wouldn't be really fair to exclude me from a future rule. Although I might feel like it is because I've spent hours and will spend hours more to gather all the pictures for my albums. Like /u/-Niernen said though, the low effort cosplay usually gets posted after someone like me posts OC cosplay and it gets received well due to the number of good shots/the quality of the cosplay is always really good.

In the end this just happens after conventions like Comiket. It'll die down once people like me stop posting high quality cosplay that gets received really well. Also recently it's just one person that keeps posting cosplay from social media websites.",2015-08-30 08:56:12+00:00,cuklc22,2.0,t1_cuk9tt4,28933.0,anime

&gt; I've posted this before, but I am seriously so hype about this show.
&gt; 
&gt; Character Introduction:
&gt; 
&gt; [Kimito Kagurazaka](http://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/223275.jpg) is the MC of the show. Basically he was kidnapped and forced to attend an academy full of ojou-sama. He was chosen because he was mistaken to be a homosexual with a muscle fetish. However this is clearly not true, but [he has to maintain the appearance](http://i.imgur.com/9CIhIpl.jpg) in order to [not get castrated by the maids](http://img.bato.to/comics/2014/03/11/o/read531ecc64a3e6c/img000031.png). [He actually has a thigh fetish](http://img.bato.to/comics/2013/11/30/o/read5299a6be092e7/img000030.png).
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; [Aika Tenkuubashi](http://www.blogiswar.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Shomin-Sample-02.jpg) [is a loner that keeps to herself in all situations](http://i.imgur.com/XUDBn7B.png?1), however she desperately wants to become popular. Kimito calls her a ""Tsun-Pure"" (basically a tsundere who is very pure and easily deceived). Kimito often makes her do ridiculous things because of this. [Example 1](http://img.bato.to/comics/2014/12/29/o/read54a13fff6d584/img000031.png) | [Example 2](http://img.bato.to/comics/2014/08/12/o/read53e99bf84d864/img000033.png). [He usually end up violently beaten though](http://img.bato.to/comics/2013/11/30/o/read5299a6be092e7/img000026.png)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; [Reiko Arisugawa](http://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/10/223279.jpg) is the textbook [Yamato Nadeshiko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamato_nadeshiko). She is highly respected amongst her peers and is captivated by anything related to commoners. Kimito accidentally stumbled into her in the shower, [due to this incident, she believed that she has no choice but to be led to the alter](http://img.bato.to/comics/2013/11/30/o/read5299a6be092e7/img000032.png). She has delusions of [marrying kimito](http://img.bato.to/comics/2013/11/30/o/read5299a6be092e7/img000034.png), and sometimes has [yandere tendencies](http://img.bato.to/comics/2014/04/22/o/read5356fb6dcad8a/img000035.png). [Did I mention she has cow boobs?](http://img.bato.to/comics/2014/04/22/o/read5356fb6dcad8a/img000007.png)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; [Hakua Shiodome](http://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/4/223735.jpg) is a child genius. She is also a loli [dandere](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dandere) with a strange behaviour where she [starts stripping whenever she has an inspiration](http://img.bato.to/comics/2015/04/06/o/read552203a075107/img000009.png). She is usually cold and emotionless to people, but for some reason, [she is very fond of Kimito](http://img.bato.to/comics/2014/01/02/o/read52c4cdf0699dd/img000028.png). [She sits on his lap whenever possible](http://img.bato.to/comics/2014/01/26/o/read52e462c0cb8d4/img000005.png). She also [has her own Kimito body pillow](http://img.bato.to/comics/2014/05/17/o/read53776495a7b1e/img000032.png). [She got super embarrassed because Kimito almost saw the pillow](http://img.bato.to/comics/2014/05/17/o/read53776495a7b1e/img000033.png). Her [interactions with Kimito](http://a.mfcdn.net/store/manga/13124/04-026.0/compressed/hshomin_sample_026_029.jpg) is my favourite out of all the harem manga I've read
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; [Karen Jinryou](http://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/2/223283.jpg) is a samurai girl who carries a katana wherever she goes. Her peers are intimidated by her due to her scary appearance. She actually love cute things, but she will try to hide her feeling by saying things like ""how pointless..."". [Example 1](http://img.bato.to/comics/2014/01/26/o/read52e462c0cb8d4/img000009.png)| [Example 2](http://img.bato.to/comics/2014/06/25/o/read53aa6ec728db7/img000026.png). Basically she is a [HUGE tsundere](http://img.bato.to/comics/2015/02/27/o/read54efdf88ea109/img000022.png)

The Shimoneta cosplays are kinda different from the typical NSFW cosplay though, for now at least since there hasn't been any cosplay related to the latter episodes.

It also annoys me because these NSFW reposts always take up space on the frontpage, so when I have fresh/new cosplay to submit I need to wait because I don't want to flood the frontpage with cosplay anymore and my post will have to compete with the repost. I was planning to submit an album of a certain character in GATE, but now I plan to wait another week.

Unlike ordinary multi-season shows, which typically incorporate a larger gap between airings and in which each season is produced separately, split-cour shows are produced as a single unit that just happens to have a 3-month break at the halfway point. Valvrave the Liberator and Silver Spoon are recent examples of split-cour shows.

When he says ""3-month break"", he's talking about one anime season. Split cour format is very common now, like Akagami no Shirayukihime and Owari no Seraph are both split cours.",2015-08-21 12:06:58+00:00,cuak4pd,3.0,t1_cuajtu9,833.0,anime

1313,"I understand we should be skeptical about this getting a season 2, although Log Horizon did get a sequel with 4,023 as its average number of sales. I suppose there were other circumstances that influenced the 2nd season for LH though (Studio DEEN?). For now I'll just tell myself that the sales for this anime were decent enough so at least there's a very small chance that it could get a sequel in the very distant future. Then again, you're probably right that the Madhouse requires a higher production cost. How are the LN sales though? And does the popularity of a LN ever relate to it getting a 2nd season?

The thing with Madhouse is that there's always busy with animating different adaptions for every season. Sometimes they even do a 2 cour adaptation. (Parasyte, Ore Monogatari!!, etc)

As for NGNL, I thought it wouldn't get an adaption because of the [scandal with the Pixiv artists](http://www.otakutale.com/2014/no-game-no-life-artist-yuu-kamiya-allegedly-caught-tracing-other-peoples-work/), but /u/RaigonZelo [said](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoGameNoLife/comments/2u7y40/anime_season_2_megathread/co6dyoi)

&gt; I agree the tracing incident didn't affect anything or else an apology would've been issued. For the spell circle incident, the anime replaced the plagiarized drawing in the home media releases and issued an apology.

and like /u/LtKill said, /u/RaigonZelo [later speculated that the](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoGameNoLife/comments/3foj8d/waiting_for_season_2_megathread_2/ctqtedd)

&gt; Eighth volume is needed to complete the arc so the second season can not be in development right now. Animation per episode doesn't happen linearly/chronologically but happens at the same time.
&gt; In comparison to season 1.
&gt; Volume 3 came out January 25
&gt; Anime announcement in July and came out April of the next year.
&gt; Assuming the author returned to his five month release schedule, volume 8 will come out between November and December. Add six months before announcement, add a year for the broadcast. Assuming 2017 Spring or Summer.

So if we don't get any news about other future adaptions coming from Madhouse for a while, then maybe this will be correct. All we know at the moment is that they'll be busy with One Punch Man. Also assuming Overlord sells well in Japan, maybe they'll do a 2nd season of that first.

This is one of the few anime that made me continue to the specific chapter where the anime left off. I usually have enough patience to wait for a sequel that should be announced after ~1.5-3 years, but after the first season ended I guess I just had too many questions that needed answering. I suppose it'll be another one cour consisting of 12 episodes again, I hope they'll be able to end at a better spot for the 2nd season. Will the pacing be just as slow as the first season? Or would it be faster, all I know is that there are more hectic/exciting battles going on constantly.

I wonder if they'll still carry on with the censoring, I know after like the first four episodes they released it uncensored but it would be nice if they would just leave it like that in the first place. I guess it also depends on how much ""damage"" is done to the humans. After all, they never felt the need to censor ""damage"" done to the cockroaches.

&gt; A lot of people are asking if this is any good, and I am a fan of the light novel. It's not too terribly exciting of a series, but I do feel like it is slightly better than its other fighting school counterparts (Blade Dance, Unbreakable Machine Doll, Kenshin no Keishousha, Absolute Duo, Rakudai Kishi, etc.).
&gt; 
&gt; The novel is centered around a setting where 6 schools participate in a fighting tournament with three parts: a pairs tournament, a groups tournament, and a singles tournament. The schools are not completely different, but some of them have an emphasis in research, holy power, etc. Each portion of the tournament has prizes (pairs &amp;lt; groups &amp;lt; single), and the overall winner gets a wish granted. Each single participant usually has a goal that they want to accomplish, and our MC wants to find his missing older sister by participating in this tournament, whether he wins or not.
&gt; 
&gt; The novel excels in that each character is motivated to win, the battles are very close, and the main characters are pretty smart and competent without being overpowered. There is also a lot of politics/beneath the surface dealings between the 6 schools and the overseeing government above the schools, and the top brass of each school/the government are all strong and sly, which is the top reason why I enjoy this series. It isn't as detailed and profound as the politics of Mahouka, but this series does have a Mahouka feel to it, where the student governments (or at least the top students) play a heavy role in the story.",2015-07-19 11:14:43+00:00,ct8jjlf,2.0,t1_ct8jc32,980.0,anime
