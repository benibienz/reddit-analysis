7,"If the guy in that made this song used presets, most people would call him a bum. Presets are pre-made sounds that people ussually sell to other people for specific VSTs. If you want to make a drop like that I would recommend any of these VSTs because they are all super good and powerful synthesizers. Massive, Serum, Sylenth or Harmor. These are some of the better VST plugins that are super powerful. But try not to use presets, people dont like that... :D",2016-09-19 00:34:15+00:00,d7sie3h,1,t3_53eqye,4372,WeAreTheMusicMakers
8,"This is the most autistic video I've ever watched... saying the ""Quality"" of music is going down is probably the stupidest thing I have ever heard. Also I know you are completely oblivious with how electronic music is made, but I'll let you know right now its about 1000x more technical and complicated compared to ""REAL"" music. Also, playing a instrument is hard, but you cant discount that if its not a physical ""thing"" you can play then its not as impressive. Along with that I'm happy to let you know that not only do most electronic producers play a instrument if not multiple. And you cant say ""REAL"" music has more dynamic range because that is just false. You technically have a infinite dynamic range on the computer, and that is just a fact. Don't shit on electronic music because you don't like it. At the very least appreciate that most artists pour their souls into almost ever track they make. Also one more thing... if you didn't know there are robots that make ""REAL"" music. They play piano, guitar and drums. However there are no robots that can make electronic music from scratch... Just think about it buddy, this vision will never happen. Good Luck though.",2016-09-19 00:27:25+00:00,d7si4ih,1,t3_53e3af,13062,WeAreTheMusicMakers

If you find it to be difficult or you are just not committed enough, dont even bother with trying to make a trade bot. It is difficult and if you want to make one you have to put in a lot more effort than just reading guides ESPECIALLY if you have never coded before, that is probably why you cant make sense of them.

96,"Yeah i would agree with just about everyone, Add some more rooms and make it a bit more complex, its pretty basic and it isn't to big so try and expand on some areas! I also felt that this area was a bit pointless. Making this area smaller might be better but yeah thats really all.. http://gyazo.com/ba6e3973f0409bcee5cabffd4af6de83",2015-07-30 19:43:33+00:00,ctlwz7q,1,t3_3f0uod,110822,csmapmakers

102,"One thing that might be a problem is windows mouse acceleration. I'm not sure how new you are to PC gaming but if you have that on, it could be really screwing you over. Also I would recommend looking up tutorials on youtube about finding your perfect sensitivity. If you are very inconsistent I would recommend that you mess around with your sensitivity anyway. It cant hurt ;). Lastly if you already have a perfect sensitivity and feel like you dont need to change it, you should be warming up before your first match everyday. There are really good maps on the workshop like 'Aimbotz'. Im DMG and I always warmup before every match because that way you know your aim is on when you start a match. Don't expect immediate improvement because it takes time to really get good. Good luck!",2015-07-06 17:59:29+00:00,csu156u,1,t3_3cbphz,801,GlobalOffensive

104,"If you really are a lefty then I would just buy a lefty mouse from Amazon or something, try it out and if it doesn't work out just send it back. Keep in mind keyboards dont come lefty and I'm not sure how people usually play with a lefty mouse but that might be something you wanna look up. However since you have just started PC gaming it shouldn't be a hard thing to switch over especially if you are a lefty",2015-07-06 17:49:22+00:00,csu0qo2,1,t3_3cbovw,434,GlobalOffensive
