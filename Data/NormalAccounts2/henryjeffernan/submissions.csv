I'm Henry Jeff, owner of the EDM production discord. We started the server about 5 months ago and since then we have grown exponentially! We just surpassed 1000 users on the server and even though the invite link is on the side of this sub I feel like a large number of people on this sub still aren't in here! For those unfamiliar with discord, its just a very polished and professional chat client. We now average around 200 people online during day hours EST and drop down to about 150 at night EST, so there is always someone to give you feedback on your latest WIP, help you fix a problem or even collab!
Anyway, here is a invite link: https://discord.gg/hwF2eCV

I spend a lot of time on my computer and do some but rare physical activity in the spring, but I just really don't eat.

I am not in the best shape especially in the winters when its snowy here in New York and fucking freezing outside, and I do no physical activity (something I want to change). I am home alone about 70% of the time as well when I am home just on my computer doing whatever. My weight is a problem that just lurks in the back of my mind, AND I really wanna beat it to fucking death and just weight 140 pounds magically, but even after all these years I have just never found anything to really motivate me to do it since it doesn't cause me depression, or any emotions really. (I'd also like to add in I am a very happy person, and while some people in my family have a track record of depression I don't have any of it.)

**If you want to submit a demo, follow the directions below**  
  
**1.** Download the demo and locate the demo file, this file is usually located in this directory (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\replays), unless you have installed it in a different place.  
  
**2.** Once you have found the right demo, copy it and rename the copy as followed: YourName_WeaponUsed_TypeOfClip_RoundNumber. For example this is what yours should look like: HenryJeff_Awp_FastFeed_24.  
  
**3.** Finally upload it to media fire, google drive or a place I could download it with ease, and send it to the email address henryheffernan.steam@gmail.com. When you email it be sure to say in the tittle that it is a clip submission! Along with the email provide your Reddit name so I can give you credit in the edit!!!
