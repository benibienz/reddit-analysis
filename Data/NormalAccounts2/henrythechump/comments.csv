8,"&gt;it takes soooo many games to rank up

There isn't anything particulary difficult about ranking up in any rank, if you are really trying to rank up and play seriously, practice every day, etc and you still don't, it is because you are not ready for the next rank, not because of shit teammates. I lost 6 games and won 1 and I ranked up on the win, if you are actually playing above your rank than you will get ranked up. As for the shitty teammates, don't expect everyone to know what to do/understand the mechanics of the game at some shitty mid-tier rank. If you are that hell-bent on ranking up, get some higher ranked friends and five queue and provided you know what you are doing you are almost guaranteed a rank up",2016-07-31 03:36:27+00:00,d5xxor3,1,t3_4vb8sx,69789,GlobalOffensive
9,"Ranked up to lem  today and I have ~600 hours, and tbh for me warming up and dm never did anything for me so for a long time I have never warmed up. U rank up from Elo. U get Elo from mostly ur kills, Mbps, score, and Kdr Also if u win a game in that ur opponents have higher Elo than u, you will gain a lot of Elo, and the opposite applies too. If ur losing aim fuels and not getting any frags at dmg it could be that your game sense/skill is just not at the level of the higher ranks. Would you rather do average at dmg or get destroyed at le? Don't be discouraged that u not ranking up, sooner or later you'll get matches against globals/supremes that will boost ur elo a bunch and maybe rank up",2016-07-13 07:13:49+00:00,d5ab81p,1,t3_4sl50m,12525,GlobalOffensive

If you are gonna listen to anyone in this thread listen to me, you have to make it better. You aren't going to hate yourself any less just because more time passes.

My money eventually  came back through work/trading, I started a bunch of new classes, spent a lot of time on my instrument,  learned martial arts went to seminars for it, etc. Eventually, I dropped thinking about what I used to have because all I thought about is what I have, right now.

145,"Yeah absolutely, thats probably my biggest regret playing violin. early on, instead of trying to get the fundamentals down, and try and gain the ability to play slow, fast, loud, soft etc. i just hammered through beginner books until i eventually figured out through trial and error proper technique. i had a teacher of course, but that doesnt mean shit if you dont apply what they are telling you to your practicing every day. your first book shouldnt be nursery rhymes, it should be a theory/scale book (of course you should keep working on pieces, doing just scales and exercises will make you want to quit.) 

when you have a lesson, play a scale for your teacher, like a g major 1 or 2 octave. ask him to tell you any problems and mistakes he sees in your playing, then think of it like a checklist. when you are going through your pieces, go down the checklist. are you doing x? are you not doing y? keep playing until the checklist is fufilled.

doing this stuff can be very boring and frusturating. sometimes you will know exactly what you are doing wrong but you cant fix it. if at any point you are getting frusturated with your playing i would just stop, and pick it up later. yeah doing everything slowly and fact checking all the time may not sound the best, it may be boring, but being really good doesnt come overnight, especially with violin.

link to slow scales - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVxwAr9RYro

147,"5-10 minutes very slow scales, set metronome to 60 bpm and try and do 10 beats per bow, then 20, then 30, etc.

10-20 minutes of regular scales focusing on intonation and technique. work on different bowing styles if your teacher is teaching you them. also, if you are doing arpeggios and chords yet, now is the time to do them.

20-30 minutes of playing your pieces, start at a slower tempo and start with the easiest one. never increase your tempo if you cant hear every note, and if you cant play it in tune (this can be frustrating and it can take a lot of discipline, but you will thank yourself later that you built such good technique.) Remember, practicing isn't just playing pieces start to finish over and over, its going through pieces slow and fixing any mistakes you have. Hit a rough spot at measure 20-30? Do it until it sounds good, and move on.

189,"Hey dude, ive done a LOT of both qbd and araxxor, and learned the ins and outs of both. Let me tell you, QBD  doensnt come close to araxxor. Let me paint a picture, a few weeks ago I worked hard and finally got full death lotus and a mh asc and oh chaotic.  I do a few kills and I get a spider leg middle and an eye. Switch to path 1,  like 5 kills later I get a leg top. Long story short I do lots more amd with a lot of luck my bank went from and asc bow to nox set, t90 power armor, seismics and more. In just 3 weeks? Araxxor to me was extremely easy as well. I read all these stories of people taking hours and loads of suplies to get it down, I didnt really watch a guide and I still never died until like 25kc. It is way WAY less monotonous than qbd imo. Because with qbd, there are a few tricks you can learn sure but with araxxor you can kill it 10000 times  and you still wont be perfect. You can always learn some fun stuff (on high enrage if youre felling ballsy kill all spiders except mirrorback, snipe and res the reflect whitch can heal 7k+)  there are some downsides however. Of course there are some downsides like the input you are gonna use more supplies but that wont even be a problem really, I always profit overload doses and brew sips from its drops anyways. Of course there is enrage but it is easier than you think like I sakd, you can get to 300% enrage no problem then if you want to keep going reset if you dont stop, enrafe shiuldnt be an issue really.

Gonna be honest though you probably wont make what I made. Thats the beauty of araxxor though! I went on some serious dery streaks but I never cared because the regular drops are so good. It doesnt matter if you go 100 kills without a leg, I wouldnt be surprised if you made 50m from onyx/onyx bolts alone. Youll never get discouraged!
