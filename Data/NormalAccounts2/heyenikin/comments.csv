I'm all for more blockbuster R-rated films, but their creators have to keep in the mindset that just because they *want* an R-rated film doesn't mean it *needs* to be one. If the content calls for it (ie. the character of Deadpool made a much better R rated film than I'd imagine a PG-13) then so be it, but what I'm hoping not to see is a bunch of films riding the R-rated wagon that Deadpool may have started and adding a bunch of unnecessary content just **to get** that R rating.",2016-10-28 12:23:50+00:00,d9bb9kt,1.0,t3_59rggi,44135.0,movies
