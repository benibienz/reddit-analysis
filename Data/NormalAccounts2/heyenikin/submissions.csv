While these games are inspired by books (which I unfortunately haven't read), this world and these characters were brought to life visually by CDPR through the art of video games rather than film. After the colossal success of W3, it was announced that a film was going to be in the works in the future and naturally, with my new found love for this game and its story, I went straight to the hype train. Choo choo!

However, during my Death March playthrough these past couple of weeks, I began thinking about the future film and it's production - primarily the casting. These characters, whom I've spent several hundred hours learning about and seeing as their stories play out, I can't imagine anyone else in that role but the character designs CDPR created matched with the voices cast for the game. I've never been so drawn into a world and it's characters as I am with this game, so imagining anybody else portraying them onscreen is unfathomable to me.

Does anybody else feel the same way or am I prematurely overreacting? I feel like I'm just in my hesitation. To me, it's different than the books-to-films casting reactions because everybody who's read the books can put together their own image of how these characters look and sound with the words provided. Those who have played this game, however, already have both of those features included in the experience, and if they're like me - think they're perfect as they are.
