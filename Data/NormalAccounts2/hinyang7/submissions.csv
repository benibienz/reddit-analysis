1. rengar could dive in easily and get out for free
2. rengar insane sustain and tankiness from W
3. stealth and burst = no counter play

so how about nerf Q base dmg but give Q a missing health scaling so rengar could punish champs thas alone and low health, while less one shot - rengar needs to deal some dmg before dealing actual raw dmg

W increase 5 ad while it hits champs, base on how many champs W hit, 10 ad per 1 champ at lv5 W

E remain the same

R: same stealth and movespeed. however rengar loss 1/3 of his armour, MR and Max Health while in stealth and within 5/4/3 seconds when he breaks the stealth. he got 30% lifesteal within the duration tho

So what about the 0.125 air cast time? I know there is a bug when bola cast on land and sometimes it is .125, but I think the mid air .125 is something meant to be right? So is that in patch 6.9 all bola cast time, including mid air cast is .25 or mid air .125 while on land .25??",Rengarmains,Rengar bola mid air cast time???,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rengarmains/comments/4ioh3i/rengar_bola_mid_air_cast_time/

Q: furious leap
rengar would jump on to enemy target on his next basic attack, dealing bonus damage.
Empowered Q: rengar next leap deals bonus physical damage and significantly increase rengar's AD


W:battle roar
unchange



E:bola strike 

rengar throws a bola to enemy target, slowing enemy down slightly.
rengar could cast his Q to the enemy struck by bola.

Empowered E
enemy is slowed and armor is lowered
E can't be cast in mid air



R: In Hunt of Trophy
Rengar goes invisible after 1.5 seconds (3 seconds if take enemy damage), gains ability to sense enemy champion. enemy champion within 1350 range would receive a '!' above them and their movement speed is reduced for 1 second. He could be seen when he approaches two enemy champions that stay close.
