3 on 3 is awesome to watch for 5 minutes, but it's way too easy to cherry pick at the blue line(Kane) and hope you can pick up a home run pass for the break away OT winner.

929,"After buying a Fossil Chronograph that didn't fit very well, I decided that I needed a new, cheap daily beater to wear at work. About an hour in to searching for an Edifice that resembled a Speedy, I came across this little rose gold beauty. I can't believe how light, quiet and comfortable this watch is.
I haven't received so many compliments on a watch this cheap before! Also, it's been nearly a year and I don't think I've had to wind it back at all. 

[It has a really cool deployant clasp(someone told me it was called that)!](http://imgur.com/a/oDKEP)

I did actually post this a little while back, so [here](http://imgur.com/a/YmZPu) are a few older shots of how it sits on my skinny wrist(7 inches around and 2 1/2 wide). Along with the 48mm Fossil for comparison.

I'd be interested in reading some numbers on how popular the leagues are outside of the US.

As far as the whole economic status theory(someone else mentioned this too), NHL tickets are only $10 more on average, which isn't significant at all. I'm not sure what pre season costs for the NBA but I can get great seats pre season for like $10 too. 

Also, NBA stadiums seat an average of 20,000 people whereas there are only 3 NHL stadiums with that capacity.


I personally feel like hockey games are just more exciting to see in person. I've been to basketball games(regular season) and the fans as a whole don't react as enthusiastically when someone scores a point. Granted, points are scored more often but that could also explain why a hockey game is more exciting to me.

1328,"It's actually fairly average. I've done like 100 or so easy clues recently and made 4M+ off of them.

Not too bad considering they only take a few minutes at that point. ",2015-06-17 21:30:12+00:00,csa0ni0,2.0,t1_cs9q62g,16188.0,2007scape

1330,But that would make me feel like an adult... And I'd have a reason to give more than 1 person a ride at a time. I'm not a damn taxi,2015-06-16 20:51:34+00:00,cs8sn87,4.0,t1_cs8rlk4,1560.0,videos
1331,"Not sure what you drive but with my Miata, I can't even look up at the bottom of the car while it's on race ramps. You have to keep your head turned which is a pain in the ass during oil changes. These things seem really helpful for a low car.",2015-06-16 20:21:19+00:00,cs8rfh0,5.0,t1_cs8pfrt,2943.0,videos
1332,I own a NA Miata and it's a pain in the ass to use jackstands/race ramps because they still don't get my car high enough. This would be a great alternative for people with smaller or lowered cars.,2015-06-16 20:19:30+00:00,cs8rcrk,2.0,t1_cs8kidi,10019.0,videos

1335,"That's awesome to hear! Hopefully with these new models, people will open up to some changes. I like 1200HP Mustangs as much as the next guy but it's always cool to see some game changers like yours.",2015-06-16 20:00:23+00:00,cs8ql27,5.0,t1_cs8bxgw,22626.0,Stance

1337,"Sorry, didn't mean to come off as an asshole. Just tired of seeing all the circlejerk posts of ""/r/subaru/mustang/chevy/ford/everyotherbrandedsub made fun of my car, so make me feel better about it.""

It's common knowledge that purists don't typically appreciate a stanced build, so why instigate?",2015-06-16 06:24:37+00:00,cs84ar7,3.0,t1_cs7t23n,21883.0,Stance
