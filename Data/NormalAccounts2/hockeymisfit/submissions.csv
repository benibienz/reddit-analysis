The interior space, fuel efficiency and price tag seem pretty great too. Also curious on what people are paying for the LX model. I know the price tag is about $16,000 but our dealerships always bumps the price up a few thousand.

How comfortable is it when driving long distances? I'm planning on spending quite a few hours in the car when I finally pick it up and the short little test drive isn't going to tell me much more than I already know about it.

Does the EX or EX-L model come with a 6 speed? As far as the website shows, it's not an option. I also wouldn't mind the leather interior but that looks like an EX/EX-L only option and I definitely don't want an automatic.

His post definitely goes in to more detail than I will, as I haven't played nearly as much as he did and I'm a much lower rank. It can get pretty complicated sometimes but it's a ridiculously satisfying deck to pull off. I can't tell you how many times I've received a ""well played"" from an opponent with lethal on board, only to burn them for 30 to the face. I've considered Corrupted Healbot over the Darkshire Alchemist but haven't tried it yet. Other players suggested adding in Alexstraza to make you a little less reliant on the combo.

[My decklist](http://imgur.com/a/14NGQ) is a little bit different(Velens is cropped out).

-1 Cleric.

-1 Harrison. Questionable but I'm not playing high ranked and I feel that the deck has enough draw. 

-1 Auchenai for +1 Embrace the Shadow. I found the difference in mana cost me my combo quite a few times. I would usually just prefer to draw the combo pieces.

-1 Excavated Evil for +1 Nova. I liked the Cleric/Acolyte synergy more than the additional damage from Excavated.

+1 Resurrect. Not sure about this yet but I like it so far. Resurrecting another Loot Hoarder/Acolyte for 2 mana before playing a Pyro combo can be pretty helpful when you're fishing for that last combo piece.

+1 SWP.

He's a very intelligent man and someone that I greatly respect, regardless of my beliefs. My grandmother on the other hand, isn't quite as respectable and is the epitome of a pastor's wife.

On our way back from a classic car show(my grandpa and I go every weekend) we were discussing some politics and I figured I'd ask their about stance on legalizing marijuana. Unfortunately, my grandma lost her son when he was young to an overdose after being a pot head for quite a while(OD'd on heroin). As you'd expect, most of the family lists pot as a reason for his death.

Anyway, we're ""discussing"" the topic(I nodded as my grandmother ranted) and she was talking about how they supposedly used cannabis in WW2(I think) as a means of chemical warfare, since it chills you out so much. I giggled as I thought about how awesome that might have been. I just kept nodding though as she rambled on, eventually stating that it has been scientifically proven that marijuana triggers violent tendencies in people and that the majority of deaths related to marijuana have been because someone involved was stoned.

It just blew my mind that she could go from talking about how chill and relaxed it makes you, to claiming that it makes people violent. I can't believe how ignorant some people are when it comes to marijuana. Even more so, I'm frustrated that I'm a part of a family that shares the same mentality. 

I love that I can sit there with a good job and great family life while also at a solid 7 as they rant about how it destroys lives. If only they knew that pot is the reason I'm still with them. That it's the reason I didn't blow my brains out in high school. 

Sorry about the rant guys, I'm just disappointed in people :p I thought it was pretty funny how she says pot makes people violent though.
