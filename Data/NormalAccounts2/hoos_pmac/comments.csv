10,Never said it wasn't. But the game is fairly young so jumping down Niantic's throat doesn't seem to be the right response in my opinion.

11,"Am I the only one that doesn't fully trust Yang? 

He says they would have shut down Pokevision if the tracking system was fixed... I highly doubt that. I am not saying he should shut it down, but in my mind, I believe he would want to keep it alive and then use it to make money for himself. Maybe I'm cynical but the way his letter reads is less of a heartfelt plea to fix the game for the world, and more of a plea to allow him to continue being the hero and in return gain potential capital. He is in it to make money, as he should be. But by making Niantic look bad he becomes this savior figure, based solely on the hard work of Niantic to put out a game we all love. We may not love it's current state or the lack of communication, but I cannot imagine having Yang calling them out is helping.

Anyway, bring on the downvotes. This is just my thought after reading his letter.",2016-08-03 15:19:28+00:00,d62jz1s,1.0,t3_4vv8z2,60532.0,pokemongo

46,"First, OP did mean Coldplay concerts. So whether it was an exaggeration or not, he started his post with hyperbole. This makes me think everything else he had to claim was based on limited knowledge and exposure to Coldplay. 

Speaking of exposure, I have probably listened to each album equally. While GS is fresh on my mind, I will stand behind my opinion that it is the most artistic album. That being said, I have a new favorite Coldplay song just about every week. Currently, ""Ghost Story"" is my favorite song.

With every new album announcement I go through each album and EP, starting from '96 to present and listen to the development. I have listened from the start, so Parachutes was my first album and it holds a special place in my heart. At the end of the day I like every single album. I do not believe anyone is wrong for saying AROBTTH is the best album. I am more upset that people automatically hate AOAL because it isn't Clocks or In My Place. I will repeat myself and say that Coldplay would not be my favorite band if they had just continuously sold out and produced the same sound. We all know Chris Martin could write a million ballads and probably has. I am just happy they have decided to attempt a brave new sound while still embracing the core Coldplay sound.",2015-11-11 19:30:06+00:00,cwwtvkq,5.0,t1_cwwrucz,3009.0,Coldplay
47,"You are saying Viva La Vida isn't/wasn't mainstream? That song topped the charts and while it didn't have the new EDM pop stylings of today's chart toppers, it was the mainstream for its time back in 2008. 

I think my problem with most people that have a hate/love relationship with Coldplay is that they never just appreciate the moment. A song gets too ""mainstream"" and it loses value because other people have heard it. Not everyone has heard how beautiful the early Coldplay like Careful Where You Stand was, and they probably never will. Personally I get the same way, I loved Viva La Vida but once I started hearing it everywhere, it became meh to me and I defaulted to the less known songs almost as a little Coldplay sanctuary. I guess it is the hipster in all of us. We feel something better in the music if we know it has a narrowed audience. 

It's awesome you have been to that many shows. I have been to 5 myself and each time I am reminded by how much they care about their fans. The early stuff was pure Coldplay and will always have a special place in my heart. Then post X&amp;Y I think they became very self-conscious about not writing music solely to be popular. It is partly why I think they kept Ghost Stories as a quick and less hyped release. And in my opinion they did a great job promoting GS. Do you remember the hidden song lyrics in the libraries across the world? That is a thoughtful promotion aimed directly at the fans. Which is why I took GS as an album for the fans. No mainstream or big music journalist is going to listen to O and make it their main story; and no DJ is going to play it next to the new Selena Gomez song. And I would never want that. It keeps part of Coldplay private for us.

While its nice to have those tracks, it is important for me to see a Coldplay song and album come out that is going to blow people out of the water and make them say, damn that was Coldplay. I believe AHFOD is going to have songs like AOAL which I can't help but dancing to and then it will have the Us Against The World type songs the true Coldplay fans want. 

I wouldn't worry. They are very cognizant of the fans. Sometimes people are too picky and just need to relax and enjoy the present. Would you rather new Coldplay or another year full of Bieber singles?",2015-11-11 14:32:09+00:00,cwwil5z,3.0,t1_cwwhgqi,2413.0,Coldplay
48,"62 shows? You are clearly a liar and as such, I have no respect for your opinion on Coldplay. While Mylo was poppy and upbeat it had the same Coldplay songs on it that we know and love. UFO and Up with the Birds for example. Ghost Stories was the closest thing to older Coldplay they have done to date. In my opinion, Ghost Stories was musically and artistically the best album they have ever done. 

It is hypocritical of you to say you don't like the new chart topping songs Coldplay is making when you list your favorite songs as the ones that topped the charts to make Coldplay famous. 

Coldplay is a remarkable band. Every album has had its own sound, it's own story. Besides X&amp;amp;Y, which I personally love, they have never sold out to the mainstream. Coldplay have even admitted to selling out a bit on that album. They have changed their personal sound and always stayed true to their themes. This new album is going to be upbeat, happy, and the bands final hoorah as they complete this 7 album cycle. I think it's going to be incredible. 

To sum it all up, I don't trust your opinion of Coldplay mainly because you skipped 2 albums and clearly have lied about how many shows you have seen. I love Coldplay and this hate of the new sound is ridiculous. Coldplay would not be where they are today had they not been the innovative and talented band they are. 7 albums of the scientist, while enjoyable, would not have sold because instead of having this conversation about their new sound, we would be discussing their lack of creativity. Something we see in many bands these days (Mumford and sons for example). ",2015-11-11 06:05:25+00:00,cww9lhk,1.0,t3_3sd7mm,7578.0,Coldplay
