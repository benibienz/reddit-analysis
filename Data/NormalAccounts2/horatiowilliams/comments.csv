1,"I haven't really encountered that problem, although I am rather extroverted. The gender balance is pretty decent, and it's against the rules of the app for people to use it for romantic purposes, and people can get banned from there. I'm not advertising for it, though, just saying it isn't that bad.

I never actually had a smartphone until about two months ago. In the past two months, I've learned basic greetings and a small amount of verbs in:

- Italian
- Russian
- French
- Ukrainian
- Portuguese
- Persian
- Arabic 
- Hebrew
- Bulgarian
- Serbian
- Hungarian
- Turkish
- German
- Chinese
- Japanese
- Korean

I'd like to learn more Germanic/Scandinavian languages as well as Finnish, Czech/Slovakian, Slovenian, Greek, Polish, Romanian, and Thai, but I haven't encountered many speakers of those languages. I think that will have to wait until I'm actually in Europe (hopefully as early as next year), as I am a big believer in immersion as the best way to learn any language.

For me, learning a new language is inherently a social thing, as every new language you learn gives you the opportunity to speak to at least 100,000 new people. It's the process of it I enjoy, forming new sentences and speaking with strangers in languages I'm only beginning to understand, rather than actual attainment of fluency, which I think comes naturally as a result. I became fluent in Spanish because I lived in South America for a year and a half.",2016-11-06 18:14:52+00:00,d9oeatg,6.0,t1_d9ngu69,67577.0,AskWomen

61,"1. Choose a few schools you may be interested in going to.

2. Find out, specifically, what some programs are that interest you.

3. Find out about career potential for any particular program. Employment rate, average salary, etc. You don't want to go through grad school only to be unemployable at the end of it.

A lot of your interests are very similar to mine. I, too, am interested in using architecture, permaculture, and urban planning to create an environmentally healthy utopian future for humanity. I have some illustrations and am creating a project about this.

What are your resources like? Is it an emergency that you begin working for money immediately, or do you have a potentially comfortable amount of savings built up? Have you spent time travelling?

If you're still not sure what you want to do, you have resources, and you haven't travelled, I recommend taking a year off to see another part of the world. I most strongly recommend Europe, if you haven't seen much of it, for architecture and urban planning. There are urban centers in Europe that are so vibrant, so full of life and opportunities to meet people, that they will make suburban America seem completely unsatisfactory. One of the things that could most improve America is by simply taking architecture and city planning that already exists in Europe and applying it here. Our car dependence has destroyed our cities and left us alone and isolated in the suburbs, forced to burn gas to perform any basic task, and never ever walking anywhere for any reason. But I'm getting off topic. Another great city you should spend time in to get a feel for how profoundly good urban planning affects quality of life, is Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Another topic to look into (if you aren't familiar with it) is permaculture. It has a subreddit - /r/permaculture - and in a nutshell, permaculture is a distillation of ideas relating to creating healthy ecological systems while also producing food and habitat for humans. Doing a [YouTube search for permaculture](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=permaculture) will also give you a sense of what permaculture is, how it works, and what the success stories look like.

Do you forgive them? Do you try to maintain a good relationship with them, but mostly ignore them because of how they are? How do you *feel* about the whole situation?

It's not so much about talking about your parents behind their back, as the guy above you said, but how you react to your parents and the childhood they gave you, and who you are in relationship to that. Your response shows a lot about your maturity as a person. Do you talk shit about your parents like a teenager, like a little insolent brat? Or do you acknowledge, factually and without judgement, their strengths and weaknesses, where they tried and where they could have done better, why they acted the way they did, and so on?

That's all on you, no matter how shitty your parents are.

If you still live with your parents, that's an almost guaranteed bad relationship with them. Depending on your parents, it can put you in a position where you're almost *forced* to act like a teenager, and that comes off as unattractive to women. If you no longer live with your parents, it means you are independent, you have a source of income (if you aren't homeless), and you have the air and breathing space between yourself and your parents that allows for a better, healthier relationship.

Take five minutes to write something every day. Some days, you won't have anything new to say; you could just mention something unusual happened at work, or some random detail and be done with it. Other days, you'll find yourself getting excited and writing twenty pages of well-written text flow, and that two hours have gone by without you realizing it. But write. Six months from now and you'll see how much it has changed your life.

Also, don't underestimate the ability of your surroundings to drain your happiness. If you live in suburbia, or somewhere you need an automobile to take care of your every basic need, you are most likely in an environment that fosters and exacerbates isolation. Get out of the suburbs. In the US, there are a few decent urban areas in which you'll actually see people you don't know, raising your chances of meeting new people on a day-to-day basis to above 0%, which is generally what they are in the suburbs.

215,"&gt; I have an intense urge to message her one last time, a kind of farewell message that she probably won't even read; but at the same time I know that I shouldn't.

I have the same feelings towards my ex-girlfriend. I want to communicate with her so badly. She's with someone new now. I can't fault her for that. We broke up because of geographical distance and it would have been stupid of me to expect her to just stay single.

There is a universal truth you must understand and internalize: To get over a girl, you must meet new girls. Meet more new girls and more new girls, experience fleeting sensations of falling in love now and then, and gradually this one will disappear from your thoughts. Who knows, she may even contact you again in the future. To psychologically prepare yourself, think of this as a period of time of no contact. Make yourself wait until, say, February 2017, or December 2020 or some such faraway future date before attempting to talk to her again. **She has another boyfriend right now.** Obviously she didn't give enough of a shit about you to tell you to leave her alone. If she loved you at any time, **she doesn't anymore.** Sorry man, you need to hear this. Yes, you will be heartbroken. I am heartbroken myself right now. Pick up the pieces and **meet new girls until you've forgotten about this.** Your emotions will settle.

If you don't meet girls frequently enough, you should pack your bags and move to a better-quality urban center. There are places in this world where people are everywhere and meeting them is fairly easy. Such places are abundant in Europe, but they are few and far between in the suburbanized United States. Do you live in the place you grew up in? Get out of there. Find a job or transfer to a school somewhere else. Go on an adventure. You are free now. You are no longer tied down in a relationship, if you ever were. The world is your oyster. Go teach English in a foreign country, it's easier than you might imagine, you don't have to speak anything other than English, and if you're interested in doing it, reply and I'll tell you exactly how. Do you have any idea how many beautiful girls there are in Spain? Millions and millions and millions. This girl who got a boyfriend and dumped you like a snotty Kleenex is not worth your emotions. You deserve better than that. Don't even bust nuts thinking about her, it'll make you more depressed.

230,"Fucking crucial. I learned this as a result of my most recent relationship.

In the before time, I believed all that was necessary for a good partner was mutual attraction. Then I spent three years dating someone who was much more conservative than me, socially. Your social views are at the root of your political views, and religion can sorta encompass the whole thing if you're a strong believer.

We would get into fights way too frequently. Way way way too frequently. Like twice a month we'd get into big arguments about stupid little shit. I can try to think of stuff but so much of it was things I just didn't even think was worth fighting about. Graffiti in the city was one example. She was totally against it, I liked it and felt that being against graffiti while being inside a city is like being against soccer in a soccer stadium. There's no such thing as a city without graffiti. Any time you have a large mass of humanity, people will draw on shit.

What I learned is that you should always ask the hard questions first before jumping into a new relationship, and you should really strive to find someone with mostly the same views as you, especially if you are particularly opinionated. Ask about the big divisive topics. Abortion. Economics. Anything that normally causes people to fight. You don't want to be committed to someone, or worse, married and with live children, and suddenly find out, say, she thinks helicopter parenting is acceptable and necessary.",2016-02-11 00:04:51+00:00,czvex0m,1.0,t3_454mhr,14889.0,AskMen

I appreciate your help, but can I be honest? This is the exact same question the career counselors always ask, rather than telling me what careers exist or are available. I can't reach into my own head for knowledge that I don't have. I don't mean to be rude or anything, so I'll answer your question directly.

In my dream job, I would travel frequently at somebody else's expense. I'd make $100,000 a year or more. I would be able to go to Europe and live there for months or years at a time, and be able to afford those unlimited passes on the Eurotrain and also have plenty of free time and never ever have to take my work home with me. I would talk to lots of people and maybe get the opportunity to learn new languages, and I would be able to afford an apartment in a nice city with my enormous salary, and I'd also be able to afford to eat healthy. Ideally I'd like to work for a company that doesn't exploit humanity's impoverished masses, or destroy the environment. I'm good at drawing, I'm okay at writing, I enjoy talking to people and to a certain extent I'm good at that, and I can type without looking.

Does my dream job exist? I wouldn't be surprised if it didn't. What are some jobs that exist, then?

250,"Here is the formula. Memorize it, take notes. This is the magic bullet answer. There are five things you need to do to attain what you are searching for. I figured this out a few years ago and it's pretty solid. Exactly five things. No more. No less. There are five things women look for in a guy.

1. **You must take care of your body.** There are three ways to do this, I think. First, you must work out frequently. Exercise. All the fucking time. Weights and cardio. Do Yoga or a martial art. Or both. Get your ass in shape. Eat healthy, stick to nuts and veggies and fruits and make that the majority of your diet. Some meat and fish is okay, very little bread. Drink as much water as you can. If you want a woman to do you the honor of finding you attractive you must put the work in for her. Lots of women say they don't care about this, maybe they have told you that personally. It's false. Next time you are in public, pay attention to the guys who are with girls. What do they have in common? You don't have to be Arnold Schwarzenegger, but you shouldn't look like a gumdrop either.

2. **Your clothes are important.** Sorry. I really hate this one. I've always been someone who never gave a shit about clothes, so it really struck me by surprise one day when a friend of mine, frustrated by my complete lack of interest in clothing, took me shopping and told me exactly what to buy. The change in the way girls treated me was instantaneous. (Some people insist it's because I felt more confident in different clothing, but I doubt that's the case; I felt the same, I still don't care about clothing and I wasn't acting any different from how I would normally act.) I remember this girl in my class at university asked me to walk with her to her next class, and I had never even spoken to her. It was like this whole new world was unlocked. Girls care about your clothes, and you will most likely need to get someone else, an ""expert,"" to choose your clothes for you. Don't rely on your own taste. Try to find either a female friend who cares about you, or a male friend who gets laid a lot, to go clothes shopping with you. Clothes shopping is boring as fuck so make it worth their while, offer to buy them lunch or something. Expect to spend money on this. Don't forget shoes.

3. **Your hair.** On your head, I mean; anything else will be covered in point 4. You mention you are balding. Guess what: You are lucky, girls may yet find you attractive. *Shave your head.* Keep it shaved. Get it shaved professionally. Or have a buzz cut. Nothing else will look good on you. You are not alone, probably half of men lose their hair. To any of you out there reading this who aren't balding, style your fucking hair. Have it done professionally. Your hair makes or breaks the entire shape of your face and the whole rest of you. It's like the first thing girls notice. Hairstyle is the difference between Brad Pitt and Weird Al Yankovic. If your hair isn't that badly thinned yet, you may be able to go around with some amount of length. If you do, get a blow-dryer and use it, the fucking things are miracle workers.

4. **Hygiene.** Everything else is nothing without this. Brush your teeth twice a day or more. Floss at least seven times a week. Shower in the morning, wake up earlier if you have to. Keep everything clean. Keep your room and your car and your clothes clean. If you have a dog, clean your dog.

5. This last point is a very fluid one, and the word I'll use to describe it is **independence** but it needs to be clarified and explained. You need to be interesting. How do you achieve that? *Read.* Read *books.* Read nonfiction. Develop interests that have nothing to do with girls. There's a whole world of shit out there. Read one random Wikipedia article every day. Go on Wikipedia *binges.* Wake up in the morning and vomit Wikipedia and drink water to get rid of your Wikipedia hangover. Be able to carry a conversation. Make more male friends. Have a group of male friends with whom you go out and meet girls together. Never in your life will you have as much fun as when you are with a group of guys meeting girls. (You can have girls in your group too, obviously, but try not to fall in love with any of them.) Move to a better city. If you live in suburbs, get the fuck out of there. How attached are you to your job? Is it the only thing keeping you where you are? There are so many better places than wherever you are, even if you're somewhere nice. Go to South America. Go to Europe. Go to Portland. Learn to cook. Cook for yourself, cook for girls. Have your own place. Having a well-paying job is important. Be someone with routines and ""pimatissiwin,"" which is an Algonquian word that means having your shit figured out and being adept at life's routines.

That's why every piece of draconian legislation that goes through is locked under the Trojan Horse of protecting children. There is a mob mentality here against relationships that violate social norms. In the 50s it was normal for people in interracial relationships to get murdered or lynched. I know a guy who was 18 and had a normal sexual relationship with a girl from his class who was 17. The police got involved and even though the girl's parents liked the guy and didn't want to press charges, he still went to jail. In some states the age of consent is 16 if the guy is 18, but not in all of them.

A little friendliness goes a long way and after some initial resistance and perhaps some awkwardness, he won't put up much of a fight. He just doesn't want you to break his heart again and he knows it's likely. Go for it anyway, it's a lesson he needs to learn.",2016-01-12 07:06:57+00:00,cyv32ry,3.0,t1_cyuwvrm,11814.0,AskMen

285,"See if you can get an ELI5 for the Korean War, which lasted from 1950 to 1953.

World War II had just ended, and countries around the world were having civil wars and revolutions. China was no exception. Tensions between the US and the Soviets were strong even before the war ended. Communist revolutions were happening in many countries around the world, and we were quickly entering a bipolar global situation in which everyone in the world had to choose whether to align with the United States or the Soviets.

The fight was only ostensibly about capitalism and communism, as both the Americans and the Soviets played nicely with small countries with the ""wrong"" economic systems when they needed to. But capitalism and communism were major factors nonetheless.

In 1949, I think, China had a revolution. Communist rebels overthrew the established power, a 30-year-old Republic which had recently replaced the imperial Qing dynasty. All of a sudden Russia's biggest neighbor became communist, which alarmed the United States to no end. Meanwhile the leaders and loyalists of the Republic of China escaped to Taiwan, where they maintain a stronghold to this day. The United States remained Taiwan's ally until about 1972. This is why the Taiwanese consider themselves an independent country while the Chinese considers them part of China. You could say they're still at war; China has mostly left them alone because they don't want to start World War III over it, and also because Taiwan produced a really good economy while the rest of East Asia was still in the shitter. Today the US pays lip service to Taiwan but it's debatable whether we'll defend them in the unlikely but possible event of a Chinese attack. This is why Taiwan calls itself the Republic of China while China calls itself the People's Republic of China. Taiwan is capitalist while China is communist. This is also why the Taiwanese, though ethnically and linguistically Chinese themselves and considered by China to be part of China, have managed to keep the Chinese out all these many decades. My last statement was slightly misleading because technically the Taiwanese people are not Chinese; they are Taiwanese people indigenous to Taiwan, and in fact the Chinese-Taiwanese are immigrants, many of whom migrated to Taiwan when the Republic of China lost the war against the People's Republic of China in 1949, and the indigenous Taiwanese are themselves oppressed by the newcomer Chinese. But I digress. We're talking about Korea.

After China ""fell"" to the communists in 1949, many other countries, especially around East and South Asia, had internal civil wars which basically amounted to communists fighting against capitalists. Vietnam started as such a war, though that was decades later and an indirect result of French withdrawal; Vietnam was in fact divided into North and South Vietnam just like Korea for a couple of decades.

The United States feared that if they allowed more countries to become communist, the Soviets would win. So they went and participated in a lot of those civil wars of the late 1940s and early 1950s. Korea was such a war. War planners had assumed that going into Korea to prop up the non-communist regime would be easier than spinning a pie, but China's victorious new communist regime did not allow it. The US invaded Korea from the south while China invaded from the north. It was a long, protracted, bloody war that lasted four years and mostly remained in a stalemate. For most of the war, the battle lines between America and China were roughly close to today's Demilitarized Zone, the de facto border between the two Koreas. For a little while the Chinese were actually kicking our ass and they almost got the whole peninsula, but then the US fought back and regained most of what's now South Korea. This was followed by another long stalemate. China's population was huge even then, and their campaign was basically just to throw more and more and more soldiers at their enemy.

Eventually the US just pulled out of Korea. The secretary of defense actually got fired for fucking it up, if I remember correctly; or something similar to that happened, maybe he just got bitched out. President Eisenhower didn't particularly support the war; it was mostly the project of a general named McArthur who insisted that victory against the Chinese was possible even as it became overwhelmingly clear that it was not.

The US and the People's Republic of China had a very tense relationship for several decades after that, having just fought each other directly in battle and all, and the two Koreas - technically one Korea, as both the North and South consider Korea to be one country only half-ruled by the legitimate government - remain in a state of war, under 50 years of cease fire.

In 1972 Richard Nixon shocked the world by making peace with the People's Republic of China and distancing the US from the Taiwanese Republic of China. This was shocking for several reasons, not the least of which that Nixon himself was a rabid anti-communist. He didn't start the Vietnam War, but he sure as hell didn't end it as he claimed he would during his campaign; in fact he escalated the conflict by bombing the shit out of the entire country, and Cambodia too for good measure. Some people say that Nixon was exactly the right politician to make peace with China, as a democrat attempting that would have, as today, been made to look weak and a pushover by Republicans and the internal media.

In the end, during Nixon's presidency and his escalation of the Vietnam War, the United States and China made peace. Or, if not outright peace, they perhaps got upgraded from enemies to frenemies. The Chinese and the Soviets were pretty openly hostile to one another, and since the Soviets remained the main enemy the US probably wanted an ally at the USSR's border. Openly, the US policy towards the Soviets for decades after WWII was called ""containment,"" and it consisted mainly of making allies out of as many of Russia's closest neighbors as possible. This was quite a project, as Russia probably has more neighbors than any other country on Earth except China.

The US and China never really became that close after 1972, and that's one of the reasons why the Korea situation persists after so many other divided countries became whole again. China and the US are still capable of military conflict, and since South Korea is basically as dedicated a US ally as Canada or England, the Chinese don't want them on their border. By the way, South Korea was as fucked up as its northern neighbor until the 1980s, when massive internal student protests (possibly about an Olympic game or something) forced the country to reform. North Korea has remained closed and oppressive since the Korean War, which to them is still raging.

This is one of the major non-economic complicating factors of Korean reunification. Would a North-South Korea combo state be a US ally or a Chinese ally? They will be forced to choose. China will not tolerate a South Korea on their side of the peninsula, and the South Korean people, like the people of Hong Kong, will not want a restricted society to come creeping in after decades and generations of being modern.

So the problem persists, year after year, with both ""internal"" Korean politics and external US-China relations complicating any progress to be made in the liberation of the North Korean people. Moreover, polls show that younger generations in South Korea are increasingly against reunification.

I'm not sober and I can not guarantee that was 100% accurate, but I hope it helps.",2016-01-12 06:38:44+00:00,cyv2f18,8.0,t1_cyujfqw,31135.0,worldnews
286,"&gt; 8 Miles to work, 8 Miles back

8 Mile is the name of Eminem's feature film.

You incorrectly capitalized ""miles"" both times for some reason.

The line ""mom's spaghetti"" from Eminem's Lose Yourself, featured in that film, has become a meme, and actually has been for many years, possibly predating Reddit. Some of the older websites like eBaum's World had content based on that line.

By the way I bike too, sometimes I go all the way to Miami which is about 8 Miles from me. I don't bike nearly as much as I want to because I work most days and I try to avoid bicycling in the rain and it's been raining a lot. But I would love it if bicycling were my only form of cardio and I could get away with it. Someday I'll live in a place where I'll be able to bike more frequently.

287,"&gt; Giving vague answers to basic questions

The other day I was at a party at a friend's house and I met this girl who talked to me and seemed really friendly, but when I asked her where she was from she gave me this weird answer like ""I don't know where I'm from"" or ""I'm from the stars"" or something like that, I don't remember exactly but it felt like a vague attempt at a creative answer and she didn't elaborate. I took that to mean disinterest, at best, and I couldn't really forge any kind of connection there.

&gt; Accommodation to the point of indecision

Fuck, I hate this one because I do it. I just did it last night with a girl and I can already tell she's lost interest in me. I've developed a whole theory around it.

These decisions usually revolve around things like, ""Should we get Chinese or pizza tonight?"" When you're accommodating to the point of indecision - ""Oh, why don't you pick? Which do you prefer?"" - it comes from a very deep sense of not giving a fuck. You don't really care if you get pizza or Chinese. Why not let her pick?

Except that *girls hate that.* Which means that even though you have absolutely no desire to select Chinese or pizza, you are going to have to shift into high gear and *give a fuck,* just for that moment, pick a goddam option and stick with it, or she'll be looking at other guys even before you arrive at Bamboo Garden.

This is especially challenging for me because I consider not giving a fuck to be one of the foundational pillars of my religious philosophy. But I get it. You just have to pick an option, whichever one pops into your head first, and grab that option and hold onto it for dear life. Chinese, say. Even though you don't give a fuck to the depths of the sea, you have to act like you want Chinese food so badly that everyone else in the car can just stick pizza into their anal cavities. You'll end up getting your way because everyone else is just like how you were five minutes ago, accommodating to the point of indecisiveness and not particularly attached to Chinese or pizza or any of the myriad other options that come out at you when you're with a girl, and you'll end up in Shanghai Express and everyone else will just have to fucking accept it. There. Now you're not indecisive and you're not accommodating. You're welcome, I hope you enjoy that fucking egg drop soup.",2016-01-12 00:27:17+00:00,cyup41b,2.0,t1_cyun7nn,3104.0,AskMen

289,"Here's my method. I've found it almost always works.

You're standing there. It won't come out.

1. Take a deep breath. A deep, deep, breath. Inhale for as long a period of time as you can. Keep going. Feel the air fill not only your lungs, but your whole body, all the way from your hands and feet through your arms and legs and core until you're just bursting with air, take some more hard inhales when you think you can't anymore.

2. Hold all that air inside of you. Do not exhale yet. Just stand there for some seconds with all that air inside you. Push.

3. Now, exhale. All the way. Squeeze yourself shriveled like a toothpaste tube. Get rid of all the air in your body, keep pushing it out until you're empty. Now pause, take a moment to just *be* without air, and push again.

4. Repeat this process - mega-inhales, pauses with pushes, mega exhales, pauses with pushes. Each full breath cycle should take you about 30 seconds or more.

This approach almost always makes me pee. I used it once when I was at a drum circle and I was in a situation in which I had to urinate in front of a large group of people. I thought I wouldn't be able to do it, but the breathing pushed it right out, *wisssssss*, like an avalanche of yellow liquid.

If I were to quantify it into numbers, I'd say this method, when I use it, produces a 97% success rate with peepee and about a 65% success rate with poopies.",2016-01-11 02:51:32+00:00,cytm905,1.0,t3_40e46w,9031.0,AskMen

404,"Honestly, I thought about it, and I get where you're coming from. Why should Christians in particular get priority over Muslims in evacuating an area when both groups are at risk? On analyzing it, it does feel like Muslims are being left behind because they're more closely related to those doing the killing, so perhaps the line of thought is, ""Ah, they are Muslims anyway, they can stay there,"" but that isn't fair because in a region like the Middle East you are born Christian or Muslim; your religion isn't really your fault.

Is this guy a prick for rescuing Christians? I don't think so. He is rescuing people. Is he a prick for prioritizing Christians over Muslims? Not necessarily, maybe, it's hard to say. What are we, as an international community, going to do about all this? Are we planning on simply evacuating all the sane people out of Iraq and Syria and leaving the extremists behind? Ultimately that isn't possible. The extremists will get out. Where will all these millions of people go, anyway, these rescues, the Christians and the Muslims and the miscellaneous? Will Saudi Arabia take them? Israel? Iran? The US? Europe? China? Russia? These are difficult logistical questions. I do get that from the perspective of an everyday Muslim living in those regions, it isn't fair that somebody will come in and rescue Christians and not you. But at the same time, the Christians there are highly at risk. Again, where do you take these people, Turkey? I get that many Muslim groups are also at high risk. Perhaps a solution could be that Shiite neighbors take in Shiite refugees, and Sunni neighbors could take in Sunni refugees, and the Christian refugees could go to some Christian community in Nigeria or something? I don't think it's right to divide people on ethnic or religious lines like that, but that is the unfortunate status of that region. Also, what happens to the land? Does it become de facto Daesh territory?

No man can do everything by himself. If one thousand people need to be rescued and you only have space for fifty, who do you choose? How do you decide? Nine hundred and fifty people and their supporters will call you a prick no matter who you choose. Should you give up and choose nobody? I don't think so. You do the best you can. If twenty other people show up and rescue another fifty apiece, as Lumberg from Office Space says, that would be great. But I don't think it's fair to call this guy a prick just for prioritizing one religious group. Every little bit helps.",2015-07-16 06:04:47+00:00,ct5336m,8.0,t1_ct4d5aq,44744.0,worldnews

In bioconstruction, if you install windows in strategic locations it creates a breeze that refreshes your whole house. Having windows facing directions like north and east, not west and south, will keep your house cooler, also.
