Time with my family is never fun with me.  I really wish I could go fully NC with some of my family.. and LC/VLC with others, but I cannot due to the love I have for my mother.

Let me preface with I am the only girl and third child in a nuclear family with three brothers.  The oldest is 18 years older than me, the next about 14 years older, the youngest 3.5 years almost exactly(6 months and a day off.)  Family members will be referred to With a # to correspond, for ease.  Exoldest brother, Bro1,  Second Brother's wife, SiL2..  

My Father is not so recently deceased.   Stories about him are for another time.  short version is that he was violent, angry, delusional, and a two faced bastard, though some of it turned out to not he his fault in the end.  (a book could be written about him).

Bro 1- in his mid 50's - he is on his fourth wife.  they don't get along.  I am not her biggest fan (when I got married, he was invited, she was not).  He has two biological children who live about a day away and two grandchildren from his second wife.  He is too proud for his own good.  The story I will tell today will give one example.  We get along moderately well.

Bro 2- Early 50's - an awesome relationship with his wife, one step kid, two biological kids.  His family seems to be thriving, and seems pretty functional.  He is the GC, but he did well for himself.

Me - mid thirties, recently married, I live several hours away from our hometown.  The daughter my dad wanted, but his disappointment as I grew to be rather tomboyish.  I have spent a few good years in therapy to control my anger and negative reactions toward several of them.  I am happily married now to a wonderful man who also helps me keep the cooler head around them.  

 Bro3- a mess, plain and simple.  Early 30's.  He has some mental problems, short list - learning disabilities( I don’t hold this against him, can't help how you were born, whatevs), anger management issues, inappropriate with any female-family or no, violent, lives at home with our mother.  he claims to be psychically disabled, but if your back is so messed up you can't work - maybe lifting 50 pound TV's for your friends is hurting your case.. Just saying. oh and he has a kid, that he acknowledges, but doesn't support in anyway.  

Mom - this woman is a saint among the human race.  my niece and nephew did not come to my dad's funeral to mourn him  They came for their grandmother.  She bailed my brother's out of many financial binds.  She was my only support and saving grace when I had a nervous breakdown and physical issues(yes she did support me, but I paid her back in spades).  She is sweet, steadfast, a bit of a worry wart, but living with the youngest has to be trying.

The story I tell today is about family pictures.  Mom is elderly and the entire family hadn't had professionally done since I was in Kindergarten.  I have a very good friend whose best friend is a professional photographer.   She did wonderfully at our wedding and I consider her friend as well.  So I invited all the family down to our home town.  I hired the photographer and set out to for once have family pictures, any maybe have normal interactions for once with them.  Every one match in pastels (Mom's choice), with blue or black jeans.  Easy peasy...

Nope.  

A few days prior to the big day, I have a brilliant Idea of buying everyone pizza for dinner.  Be a normal sit down family dinner, not fancy, but hey no one can say no to a pizza buffet?  Yeah I got yelled at for not asking Bro1 first before I asked the entire group.  This apparently conflicted with his plans of having pizza Friday night. This drive me into a rage, because no matter what I did to be nice to people, I got put on blast.  My husband had to deal with me crying out of sheer anger.  Finally when I calmed down, called back and asked if we could make it so that we could buy Little Caesar’s and just eat at his house.  That was fine...

Nephew1 tells me on picture day, that he's has already had to threaten my younger brother with physical violence within the week that he was there, to stop verbally abusing Mom.  Several members  refuse to wear semi matching clothes, which I get, money can be tight.  but is the yelling at each other because none of you can listen to simple directions or agree on one thing? Really?

The younger brother yet again shows his ass by acting out causing Nephew1 to pull his own uncle aside to correct his behavior.  There was no violence, but I can tell that my brother has been cowed.  

Ok, so Pictures, done.  Lets get out of this oppressive heat, shall we? Time to buy that pizza!  We get ready to leave and Bro1 has decided he wants to now go pick up the pizza.  I have only large bills, and planned to run by and grab it on the way.   Sorry, you’re' family, but I don’t hand money over to anyone who I am not buying something from or my husband.   This caused him to have a snit fit and pout about the fact he couldn’t go pick it up.  

Now Bro2, SiL2, and their kids – Came in, got pics done, no fuss, a short conversation about looking for a photo album for Mom with all the pics from today and some older ones.  They get in get it done and head out.  

At the end of the day this was a pretty decent day for the family  I like to think that they finally understood that this was all for Mom, that we all needed to let her have a low argument day for her.  

My next story will be a good reason for me to go VLC/NC  promise  ",JUSTNOFAMILY,Picture day!,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/4pz6g3/picture_day/
