160,"I wasnt referencing my own situation; I'm doing fine. I'm talking about everywhere.

What you said doesn't address sick people in food service jobs handling my food and utensils or any other business that I go into. 

The point is that putting the responsibility on individual workers to quit on order to keep workplaces reasonably healthy doesn't accomplish that goal. The same people and policies are still there, leaving every (new) employee and customer in the office at risk. 

If you're an employee who isn't sick (yet), or a customer, you still have no reasonable assurance of not being exposed to who-knows-what.

There has been one building-wide and one block-wide outbreak in my (non-major) city in the past 6 months, which the country health department traced back to ill employees. 

Most people agree that's a fucked up situation. If action by a single employee could fix that situation, as you suggest, that would be ideal. But we know that it can't.

The question becomes whether we see this as worthy of action by employers, and not just employees? Should we enable anyone in a supervisory or management role to make decisions that affect *public* health? We've already answered no to that question in many other areas. Is the cost of effective action lower than cost of continued inaction?

What do you think?",2016-06-15 21:43:08+00:00,d4arrjx,6.0,t1_d4apve8,2476.0,pics
161,"That's what I thought too, until I learned that different rules apply to paid time off (PTO/vacation) and sick time.

PTO is subject to approval by your superior(s) in many areas. That means you have to get permission or authorization to take time off. If you get sick at a time your boss(es) decides is too inconvenient, you can be penalized for missing that time.

PTO in lieu of sick time also removes objectivity from illnesses that qualify as ""sick enough to be excused from work."" Instead of a doctor's authorization or verification, it's solely up to an employer. 

If any of your bosses is an idiot, they may not prioritize the importance (to the company's overall productivity and employees' health) of keeping contagious or dangerous illnesses out of the workplace. They may not even understand the risks of different illnesses (this isn't rare). This doesn't just screw the sick employee, it exposes everyone else in their workplace. You can see many stories like this in this thread.

Many employers don't abuse PTO at all, but enough employers and industries do that it's a problem. It's usually in industries where employees make lower wages and have few (if any) benefits. 

Employees shouldn't have to rely on their boss not being an idiot or jerk to have a reasonably healthy workplace. Customers/clients of brick and mortar establishments shouldn't have to rely on that same luck, either.

290,"Something very underappreciated in America is the impact that a lack of benefits has. Most low wage jobs here have poor or no benefits.

People can't afford to be sick or take care of family that's sick. Most low wage workers don't get paid sick leave and many have very basic or no health insurance. A copay or deductible takes a chunk out of an already tiny paycheck. Even people who say the emergency room is always available for ""free"" don't account for the cost of prescriptions or needed follow up care. People often have to choose between paying for medicine and paying basic bills. 

Sure, if everything goes fine and life doesn't throw any curve balls, some people can at least pay their bills. But when is life perfect? 

Our low wage workers lack financial security and are in poorer health because of it, which leads to many other problems. Then people treat them as if they're less than human and deserve to be in that situation.

It's not just costly to our society, it's unjust.",2016-05-13 00:12:39+00:00,d33ejyn,6.0,t1_d33dwtq,1056.0,AskReddit

358,"This is **not** a poll of likely primary voters, so while it's reflective of registered voter sentiment, it's not intended to reflect the results of a primary if it were held today.

Full poll results are from a statewide poll of 886 adults contacted by live callers on both landlines and cell phones from April 1st to 8th, 2016, including 738 registered voters reported on in this release. The registered voter sample has a margin of error of +/-
4.0 percentage points; the subsample of 244 Republican and Republican-leaning voters has a margin of error of +/- 6.9 percentage points, and the subsample of 292 Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters has a margin of error of +/-6.3
percentage points. Interviews were done in English and, when requested, Spanish.

Notable:

* Democratic-leaning independents
appear to be fueling Sanders’ 
momentum, with just over half of this group choosing the Vermont senator. 
Confirmed 
Democrats, on 
the other hand, 
firmly support Clinton, at 57 percent.

* This poll overlapped the Wisconsin primary on April 5th. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz 
comes in 
third 
at 18 percent, though support 
for the senator grew 
here 
in the days 
following his Wisconsin primary win.

* New Jerseyans who have not yet declared a party affiliation may do so at the polls on primary 
day, 
and 
those who want
to switch parties 
could
have 
done so
up until just a few days ago.

* In the GOP primary, NJ is a winner-take-all primary with 51 delegates. In the Democratic primary, NJ will award 126 delegates proportionally, with an additional 16 super-delegates who can vote for their personal choice of candidate.

* Kasich is 
one of 
the most liked candidate
s in the race: 41 percent are favorable toward the Ohio 
governor, 
just 
21 percent are unfavorable, and 38 percent either have no opinion or do not know him.
Fellow GOP candidates 
Cruz (at 22 percent favorable, 58 percent unfavorable) and Trump 
(
30 percent 
favorable, 62 
percent unfavorable) 
pale in comparison,
as their ratings 
continue to 
decline
. 

* Sanders still garners the highest favorability rating among all the candidates – 54 percent 
favorable (up 
eight
points) to 32 percent unfavorable (up three points).
He is 
now 
viewed 
more 
favorably than Clinton by 
Democrats (74 percent versus 70 percent), 
independents (53 percent
versus 
31 
percent), women (56 percent versus 46 percent), and non-white voters (61 percent versus 49 percent).

* Clinton, who hits a new low at 39 percent favorable to 50 percent unfavorable – quite the reverse from Clinton’s ratings just over a year ago. Clinton has even slipped a few points with her own party base, now at 70 percent favorable (down eight points) to 17 percent unfavorable (up seven points).

361,"This poll was in the field from April 7th-12th.

Respondents were interviewed in English on both landlines (283) and cell phones (139) by the staff of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion (MCIPO) in Allentown, Pennsylvania on the Institute’s Computer Aided Telephone Interviewing (CATI) system.  With a randomly selected sample of 422 respondents the margin of error for the surveys is +/- 5.5% at a 95% level of confidence.

[Article in The Morning Call](http://www.mcall.com/news/local/elections/mc-pa-republican-presidential-poll-20160415-story.html)

Notable: 

* 34% of likely Republican voters said that if Trump was the Republican nominee for president, they would enthusiastically support him, while 25% would not support him at all. If Cruz became the nominee, 24% would enthusiastically support him, while 25% would not support him at all. Kasich would receive the enthusiastic support of 29% of GOP primary voters, with 20% saying they would not support him at all. 

* Trump continues to dominate among Republican men in Pennsylvania, receiving more 
support (46%) among this group than both Cruz and Kasich combined (45%), but 
maintains much smaller leads over his two rivals among GOP women in the Keystone 
State.

* About 2 out of 3 Republicans agree that Donald Trump “speaks the truth.”

* Only 4 out of 10 likely Republican voters agree that Donald Trump is a conservative.

363,"Yeah, the NY Dem vote is so concentrated in/around NYC. I'd need to go look at the numbers to confirm (and my opinion may be affected by confirmation bias) but it seems that overall, the D vote in major metro centers favors Hillary to a greater degree than in smaller metros/suburban/rural areas. 

My best guess why is that the ""establishment"" (electeds, donors, and party leadership and activists) are heavily concentrated in major metros, and so there's a deeper loyalty to establishment folks because they've shared those relationships over time and they are essentially more comfy with the party power structure and traditional succession of leadership, and have a longer/deeper relationship and familiarity with those in power. Although they're loyal to issues, their loyalty is centered around people to a greater degree than elsewhere. So they're more comfortable voting for Clinton as long as she has/adopts/parrots support for progressive policies.

Whereas in smaller metros/suburbs, loyalty is based on issues to a greater degree than metro people because they don't have the frequency or intensity of relationship/exposure to the ""establishment community."" 

Poverty has also been pushed out of metro areas and into suburban and rural areas, so the edge that Clinton has with wealthy voters is also concentrated in major metros. It's once thing to be aware of poverty and the downsides of income inequality, but another to live it. The sense of severity and urgency is reflected in that difference. 

So in NY, the fundamentals of the Dem primary all line up in Clinton's favor.

Sanders' strength in rural areas was one of the most surprising elements in the early primaries to me, and this is how I've reconciled it as the race has unfolded.

This is just a working theory of mine, and my actual work has prevented me from an in-depth examination of this, but that's my $0.02.",2016-04-19 17:26:10+00:00,d2940ek,3.0,t1_d292nlg,1745.0,Forecast2016
364,"This poll was in the field from Wednesday, April 13th to Friday, April 15th. 

Respondents were selected from YouGov's and two other online panels. These are “opt-in” panels which are open for anyone to join. However, YouGov also randomly selected persons from voter registration lists who had previously voted in primary elections and contacted them by phone. [Full methodology is here](https://today.yougov.com/news/2015/09/13/methodology-2016-cbs-news-battleground-tracker/).

Notable:

&gt; * The only groups with whom Sanders bests his primary opponent are “very liberal” voters (55% to 44%) and 18-29 year olds (66% to 28%). New York is also a “closed primary”, meaning only voters registered as Democrats can participate. This appears to be a boon for Clinton: she leads by 19 points (57% to 38%) among registered Democrats who also identify with the party but trails by 46 (72% to 26%) among the much smaller share of voters who are registered as Democrats but describe themselves as independents. 

&gt; * Despite weeks of controversy over Trump’s comments about women and abortion, there is little sign of a major gender gap forming in the Republican primary race. In fact, Trump’s support is fairly even across demographic groups, but the non-Trump vote does vary significantly. For example, while Trump earns around half of the vote regardless of self-identified ideology, Cruz leads Kasich by 34 points among “very conservative” New Yorkers and trails Kasich by 17 among “moderate” voters. Similarly, Cruz beats Kasich among Tea Party supporters and trails among the movement’s opponents (while Trump leads with majority support in both groups).

422,"I agree with you about the ultimate result, but looking at the voter composition from the inaugural caucuses in KY and 2008 NV (and the even crazier 2016 WA caucus) there is no precedent for anticipating an unaffiliated turnout as low as 2%.  

In terms of this state election, the only real question is will Cruz get 50%. Overall, results from Trump sentiment questions matter *a lot* for how the rest of the GOP nomination race will play out. 

The Trump questions in this survey are the types of questions GOP influencers consider when determining if he's truly a risk to the party and if an effort to thwart Trump is worth the effort. The results of this survey certainly indicate a lot of risk for the Utah GOP if Trump wins the nomination. 

Given the questions asked and the bios of the Y2 principals, I'm inclined to think the goals of this poll are not only to provide a status of the horserace and promote the firm, but also to provide ammunition for those opposed to Trump within the GOP. That could also answer why the unaffiliated vote percentage is so low. :)

However, it is not possible to credibly claim that anything about these results indicates that closing the delegate gap is more likely for Sanders.

So yes, SC matters because it awards delegates, and Clinton's lead just grew. Fundraising and enthusiasm (leading to turnout) hinges on being able to make a current and credible case that you have a path to victory. More  immediately upcoming states more closely resemble SC than any other state so far. 

In order to stay the course in the long term, especially to last long enough to run effective operations in the states that are likely to be friendly to Sanders, he needs to keep the money faucet flowing and supporters engaged. 

The race is not over today, but  Sanders' path to the nomination narrowed based on this result. His road just got tougher, not easier, in the short term.

Republicans are having their 2008 in terms of turnout and that should worry Democrats, although with so many crazy and unprecedented elements in this race, it's premature to assume that primary turnout indicates general election enthusiasm.

546,"&gt; I've tried masturbating to show my partner what I like, but the issue is that I have to fall back on my fetishes/bizarre pp to even get going. 

I totally know what that's like. Have you ever told a partner about the kinks that get you off?

&gt; And even then, it usually takes a long time for me to get off that way. I can sometimes get myself off in 30 seconds or less (but those are special days) otherwise it takes a while. The last few times I've tried it, it's dragged on for a while and there's only so much patience a person can have, you know? Eventually I start realizing how long its taking and the stress start piling. (And I can't get off with vibrators and envy you.)

&gt; Any advice for that? 

I was trying to keep my long-ass reply from being even longer by not expanding on those things. I probably gave the impression that I didn't deal with stuff like that but I did. I do. Quite a bit.

It's hard for me to get in the headspace to even masturbate in front of a guy for exactly the reason you describe. 

Sometimes it's just not going to happen. That's ok. It's part of the process. Once I know it's not going to happen, I'm cool with just moving onto ""normal"" fucking. I take pride in the quality of my fucks and part of the benefit of that is both of you knowing that he won't be left without a very satisfying cum, even if you don't. That transition is easier when you talk about it up front. 

Most of the time before I fuck a guy, I have a convo with them to tell them that I might not cum for a while, that I still LOVE sex without cumming, and some things that might help. That usually helps to lessen the anxiety for both of us and kind of makes it a team effort.

The key is that you get with someone that you can go through this process with, because so far it's been you trying to figure out what the underlying issue is, not on how to fix it together with a partner.

&gt; Because I can't get off by thinking about the person with me or imagining the things we're going to be doing after. It's usually weird to jar back into real life after. What do you think of when you show your partners what you like? 

I've done it while watching porn and that's been helpful. I'm also really into dirty talk and hearing about my partners experiences with others, so I've done it before while he described how he fucked another woman. Or talking about other kinks we share or while he masturbated. Kind of like a mutual no session where we're both watching our own porn or reading naughty stories. 

&gt; Is it weird for your partner if you disappear into a headspace that doesn't include them in the slightest? 

Yes, it can be. Talking beforehand helps, as I've said before. A lot of this is about setting correct expectations. The pressure and anxiety builds when one or both of you feels that something is happening that shouldn't be. 

I've learned that it's easier to just tell them what the deal is so we're on the same page, and mix in sessions where he is your sole focus, even if you don't cum. He has to know that he's actually doing the most for you by helping you in this part of the process where he's not the focus, and you have to show your satisfaction with him in other parts.

&gt; What do you do if it takes too long? 

Just move on.

&gt; Or in my case, what do you do when you can't turn yourself on in that situation? If what's turning me on is essentially my fantasies and the action is just

You can't force anything in that moment, but try to keep an item mind about trying again and trying new things. Being able to tell someone the whole deal helps me. It's not just them knowing that is taking a long time this time, or that odds are I won't cum, but that I trust them,  desire them, and want to cum with them so much that I'm willing to work through this process together with them.

&gt; Nearly every relationship I stop getting wet after the first few times we have sex because the newness of the relationship has worn off

Alternately, I'm going to give you a suggestion that I wouldn't give to most others, but given that our experiences are so similar, it would probably help.

You need to find a person who shares some of your kinks who you can fuck without the pressure or expectations of emotions. A guy who you aren't emotionally invested in who can play along with what turns you all the way on, even if it's incredibly kinky. Someone who you don't have to worry about scaring or offending or telling people you know. An emotionless, yet still crazy hot sex hook up. 

Then you can openly resort to the same fantasies you always do, and work this process without the anxiety of doing it with someone you like, or who wants more from you. It's liberating to not have to hide anything about who you are sexually. Someone else who shares your kinks will often heighten the experience for you.

That helped me and made the process easier later with someone I liked.

&gt; Part of the reason I usually feel so hopeless is that positive orgasm experiences don't include me and another person so trying to get off in that situation feels almost counter-intuitive. During sex I feel like most of the time its the novelty of a new person that really doing all the stimulating because otherwise, most things my partner does become annoying. Things like touching me or kissing my neck go from being really hot to- 'stop please jesus why? Go fucking masturbate' within the span of several hours.

I definitely get that. It's because doing the same thing and expecting a different result is essentially pointless. The good news is that you still have a number of different things to try.

&gt; I feel like I've tried nearly all the things r/sex's FAQ has recommended about relaxing, trying to just feel the pleasure and not letting the pressure of getting off intrude on my sex life.

Yeah, those are easier said than done and harder for people with our kind of issues.

&gt; As for the intimacy issues, I've been to a therapist and we've touched on the subject a number of times. I don't have issues with falling in love or getting hurt, I've dumped and have been dumped. It's a normal thing. I've been in a number of long term (1-2 year) relationships that are considered normal and healthy (minus my sexual issues).

&gt; I also don't get infatuated, but I like the chase and the novelty of the situation. Once that's gone, so is the interest. I've always been a very introverted person (up until very recently) and I've always been able to entertain and have fun by myself so I don't really feel that I need another person to give me love or any of those other things. 

&gt; Basically it boils down to me wondering why I would want someone to get off with when I can just do it myself? I don't need someone to cuddle or watch movies with, I can do all of that alone just fine. It's like I'm having a hard time understanding what another person could possibly bring to a relationship that I couldn't do for myself? It all feels like such a hassle, to compromise on wanting sex, to decide where to go on dates, to put all that extra effort for an outcome that seems like it has absolutely zero pros?

Holy shit, yeah I get that. I'm unusually comfortable alone. I'm a great companion for myself. I do not require the level of intimacy I see in most relationships. I need more time alone or more breathing room than a lot of people prefer in relationships. It's caused issues before. 

That said, I've learned that that's not always great, and can hinder the possibility of developing a healthy relationship. It enables some bad habits, like being too rigid, unemotional, or eager to end things. There are benefits to good relationships, even when you don't feel incomplete or lonely without one.  


&gt; I need to fix this but I don't even know where to start? It feels like relationships go against all my practical reasoning.  

Yeah. It's tough. I don't have it all figured out. I just know where you're coming from. Hopefully a few of the things that have helped me so far can also help you.",2016-02-22 05:36:28+00:00,d08zpfk,3.0,t1_d08t5di,11544.0,sex
547,"A really hard thing about being your age is that you can't see how ""normal"" you are in the normal world, beyond your parents and school and city. 

That's not your fault. That's why it's important for people like me to tell you, because you have no way to see that.

When you get beyond high school or the place you grew up, you realize that there's no such thing as ""normal."" Sure, in your school or area you may be different from others, but in the wider world, there are TONS of people who like what you like and are how you are. High school and in-city cliques and drama are bullshit. 
Right now, all of your friendships are usually based on proximity.

When you're able to be out on your own, you have the freedom to go where you want, choose who to connect with and what to do based on your interests.

Doing cringey and assholish stuff is just part of growing up. It's your whole world now and you can't go anywhere else so I totally get that it feels all-consuming. That's not bad at all. I'd be more worried about the people who don't think they've ever done that, because we all have.

You also learn that just because someone seems like they have it together and are ""normal"" and happy in public and on IG means nothing. The people with the most flawless public personas can be more fucked up than you can possibly imagine. Don't believe the hype. And never make the mistake of comparing yourself to it.

You mentioned your mom preventing you from getting help. I don't know where you are located, but if there's a local health clinic or college, call them and see if they offer services for people your age without parental notification because they often do. Calling a crisis hotline can also help with locating places like that too. 

Basically, just hold on for a little bit longer and you'll be able to take control of your life and seek out exactly what you want. Just try to not beat yourself up so much in the meantime.

550,"**TL;DR: Cumming alone is much different than cumming from sex with a partner, and you have to take the lead and learn how. You probably also have some intimacy issues to address.**

It seems like there are two issues here: 

* it's hard for you to cum with others
* you have issues with intimacy

**Cumming with a partner**

The first issue is pretty common. Masturbation and sex are very different for most people. Just because you can get yourself off quickly and easily does not mean the same is true when having sex with a partner. 

There are a number of threads here that discuss this, but you have to learn how to cum with a partner, with their help. I think that especially for women with some intimacy issues, getting to the point where you're relaxed and comfortable enough to let go and focus on just enjoying the pleasure is difficult. 

For me, focusing on someone else completely takes me out of the headspace where I'm able to cum. I still enjoy getting fucked even without cumming, but it takes a lot of work for me to cum with a partner. That's impossible to do without communicating and working together.

What helped me and others is being very open about this issue with partners about the situation. Then start by mimicking the way you masturbate with him as a passive partner (which has always been cool because he knows you'll be more than happy to get him off after, and this process will lead to even better sex). The passivity is important because focusing on him and his pleasure puts your focus in a place where you can't cum. You have to work up to that.

Humping and grinding my clit (Or a vibrator) gets me off when I masturbate, so I literally started with him just laying there and dry humping his leg or cock. When I could cum from that, I'd have him inside me while I was on top, lean forward and grind my pelvis/clit against him until I could cum. Then we tried to add different positions and he would take an increasingly active role. 

Bottom line, if you wait for someone who can get you off, it E won't happen. This isn't an issue about the guy's skill, it's about learning how to cum with a partner.

**Intimacy issues**

Addressing this one depends on why you have issues with getting beyond the early during stages. 

Is it that you find the thrill of the chase much more exciting than being with someone? Afraid of getting hurt? In love with being infatuated? Feeling like you're settling? Still learning about what you want and determine what you don't? Looking for validation  from someone else that you can only get from yourself?

I don't know, but it's time to start asking those questions if yourself. Therapy can be helpful with working through these kinds of issues and I always think that's wise to pursue, if possible.

It seems like the issue about orgasming with a partner might be making this issue worse, because it seems like you're also trying to find a guy who can get you off, but as discussed above, that's not possible with any guy until you take the lead in working on it.

Like you, I also think about other people doing things when I fantasize, and I'm not involved in the action. I'm also *extremely* sexually adventurous and get the same kind of feedback you have. Also was sexually aware and masturbated earlier than most.

I think that's why my default is not having a connection between sex and emotion. I have to work hard to get those things to work together. The more I like someone, the harder I have to work be able to cum with them. 

Now I have to think some more because maybe that's why my fantasizing rarely involves me. That was the only frame of reference I had when I started masturbating. I couldn't draw on my experiences with others, just the erotica or porn. Hmmm...

Anyway, hope this gives you some food for thought.

Best wishes.

577,"Caucuses traditionally do not favor moderates. That's because of the incredibly low turnout in caucuses (getting voters to show up in person at a specific time is incredibly hard, and few people do). Caucuses are usually comprised of voters who are most politically interested. These are the die hards and true believers that are the furthest from the center in their party.

This is the case in caucuses even more than primaries. That's why you hear people talking about candidates ""pivoting"" to more moderate positions in the general election, and why there's worry on both sides of the aisle that the primary process might produce a nominee that is too extreme for the general electorate.

Caucuses also favor strong retail politicians and campaigns with strong ground games. As I said earlier, getting people to show up as a certain time in a specific place where their vote may be publicly known is one of the hardest feats in politics. Its importance and difficulty is usually underestimated. It takes an army of well-organized volunteers making repeated personal contacts with tens of thousands of people. A campaign that does that better than their opponents has an advantage, and this is often the biggest variable that isn't captured in polling.

The speaking portion sometimes has a small influence on the 2nd choices of caucus goers whose 1st choice didn't reach viability.

593,"Those questions are standard for message testing polls. The question order reinforces that. To be clear, almost all of the campaigns are running polls like this for their candidate and opponents. This is how campaigns this size develop their own messaging and lines of attack. 

This is why you don't see pollsters calling this a push poll. 

However, message testing polls are rarely released publicly. This is a pollster that usually does private polling, and odds are this is a standard poll design for them. It's certainly a valid testing design, but the disclosure is far short of the industry standard for public release. My guess is that this was released for the benefit of SuperPAC messaging efforts. It's not coordination if it's info available to the public.

Push polls don't have polling as their goal, and they go out to a much larger group than a poll would call. Everyone knows that time and attention are limited on calls, so push polls go to the negative messaging first in order to tell their message before the recipient hangs up. 

I won't speak to this poll's overall quality, but this is definitely not a push poll.

642,"This poll was in the field from Feb 4-8, so it doesn't reflect any change resulting from Saturday's GOP debate. The MOE (aka MSE) for the Republican LV subset is +/-5.2 percentage points.

Fwiw, I'm of the belief that Rubio-geddon is being overblown in the media and it won't affect Rubio (or Christie) as much people are suggesting in NH. Viewership remained strong through the end of the debate, so just about everyone who saw his early mauling by Christie also saw him perform well for rest of the debate. With the debate on a Saturday night and the Super Bowl on Sunday, it wasn't the dominant story it could have been otherwise. Now that a strong narrative has been established (within the media, if no one else), that may color coverage going forward and impact the upcoming races. 

I also believe Trump will underperform in NH (as I believed in Iowa), although I don't know that he'll underperform enough to lose here.

&gt; People are also able to get stuck together while having intercourse - a rare occurrence known as 'penis captivus', where the vagina muscles clamp down on the penis much more firmly than usual.

&gt; Dr John Dean, a UK-based sexual physician, previously told the BBC that when the penis is in the vagina it becomes increasingly engorged.

&gt; He said: 'The muscles of the woman's pelvic floor contract rhythmically at orgasm. While those muscles contract the penis becomes stuck and further engorged.'

&gt; Finally the vaginal muscles relax, the blood flows out of the penis and the man can withdraw.

&gt; He said that over the years, several of his patients have discussed their experience of getting 'stuck' - more out of curiosity than because it was a problem, however.

&gt; One way in which doctors are able to separate people stuck together is by giving the woman an injection commonly used to dilate the uterus of pregnant women.

660,"Largely agree with /u/SomeNorCalGuy. 

For the Dems, NH is different than other states with upcoming primaries/caucuses. That's why you hear the Clinton team trying to manage expectations and tell people to expect a loss because the state is more liberal and friendly to candidates like Sanders, despite the fact that the Clintons have decades long ties to the state and they voted for the comparatively moderate Clinton over Obama and Edwards in 2008. 

Taking that into consideration, it's both notable that she fell so far behind in polls because of her prior support, and expected that the polls will tighten to more closely reflect the prior ideological preferences of the electorate as people make up their minds in the final days.


From the campaigns' perspectives, the NH Dem race is more about performance against expectations instead of the results, and it's setting up to be viewed as a win for Clinton if she finishes in a close 2nd place. Sanders will not win by 30 points. It's hard (though not impossible) to see Clinton closing the gap entirely, but the narrative leaving NH will be different depending on whether Sanders wins by 15 or 5. 

The upcoming Dem races will certainly be impacted by the outcome in NH, but there's no question that Sanders has ground to make up (like most candidates without a national profile running against candidates with one) in order to win in succeeding states. There is also a much longer break after NH than the week break after IA, so the candidates and issues have more time to be scrutinized and those race have more of an opportunity to settle, especially in a two person race.

The GOP race is interesting to me for many of the same reasons that SMNC articulated, and the race is still meaningfully shifting because of coverage and communication. It's so volatile in these closing days that, like Iowa, the polls may not be able to fully capture where things end up.",2016-02-04 23:36:09+00:00,czo6g0r,2.0,t1_czntke6,18219.0,Forecast2016

You didn't blow it. It would be one thing if he calmly explained to you that he's decided to abstain from sex for his own reasons, but he understands your desires and wanted to talk about how to proceed as a couple. 

That's not what happened. 

He revealed who he really is. Seriously, that's major red flag behavior and you should be thankful you know it now instead of later. 

His reaction was about him and his issues, not about you. That can often be the hardest thing to wrap your head around. And honestly, it sounds like you might be more excited about the *idea* of him and what you hoped the relationship would be instead of who he actually is in reality. 

From your prior response, it seems as if you might be hesitant to move on because you're insecure about finding a partner because of your disability. But play this out. If you were to continue to pursue him, how do you see a relationship functioning? This guy got irrationally angry, told you that he think women with sexual desires or a sexual history are impure (?!?!) and that he doesn't want a sexual relationship.

The Clinton team is definitely focusing hard on tiny precincts and more rural areas. And they know their counts. Sanders doesn't.

If Sanders loses Iowa, his biggest regret should be his lack of field organization. They had enough willing volunteers, they just didn't do enough with them. People underestimate how much work and personal contact it takes to get someone to show up to a caucus (this is the same reason why I believe Trump will under-perform in IA). 

If Clinton loses Iowa, her biggest regret should be not defining Sanders before he did. She could have branded him as an extreme socialist from the very beginning, but she ignored him as he spread his message unchallenged, and people saw that his policies are more in line with traditional Dem/liberal beliefs than hers are. Same thing happened eight years ago when the punditocracy and her campaign couldn't conceive of America electing a black man named Barack Hussein Obama--until the polls proved them wrong and panicked and inconsistent messaging ensued. The difference now is that her ground game is better than her opponents. We'll see if it's enough to win. ",2016-01-28 21:34:24+00:00,czfm6gl,5.0,t1_czfkz1g,1677.0,Forecast2016
774,"I'm almost exactly where you are with the Dem race.

Clinton's ground game is superior to Sanders. I've been saying for a little while that this race rests on the Sanders GOTV operation, and I still believe that.

Although there is a lot of Sanders enthusiasm, his support is strongest with the groups that are hardest to turn out. It's true that there's a lot of Sanders enthusiasm and momentum, but its among groups of voters that are less likely to vote the Clinton supporters. 

Sanders may have more volunteers, but Clinton has a more experienced and comprehensive field operation. Although it's been 8 years, Clinton's team has been there before, which makes a difference. Clinton also has more support than Sanders from the 2012 Obama core team, and the data and expertise that comes with it. Clinton's data and targeting is better than Sanders.

Normally that would spell a clear win for Clinton, but the enthusiasm gap is wide, and perhaps still widening. Sanders has the better message, but Clinton has better data and targeting. 

Aside from the campaigns, there's also the real possibility that the Dem caucuses will be a [dumpster fire](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/24/iowa-democratic-caucus-in-peril-amid-volunteering-crisis).

With almost 20% of caucus locations without a trained chair PLUS the introduction of new Microsoft caucus results reporting app, they could see [some of the issues Ohio just had in a similar situation](http://www.wcpo.com/news/political/elections-local/hamilton-county-board-of-elections-report-promises-fixes-after-83-of-poll-sites-report-problems).

I'm familiar with what's involved with organizing state caucus operations. I cannot, for the life of me, understand how after national stories about the state party's lack of preparedness, there's still 300+ open caucus chairs. It's an embarrassment. I'm amazed the DNC hasn't stepped in. Also amazed that the campaigns didn't get their own people into most of those slots, given that this has been known for months. 

A cynical person might say that the Clinton campaign and the DNC both stand to benefit from caucus problems, and that's why they haven't been aggressively working to fix it. Anything that frustrates new voters and lowers turnout or causes people to leave before the caucus is complete benefits Clinton. A messy caucus almost certainly means that Iowa will lose their first in the nation caucus, which almost certainly means that the demographics of whatever state(s) it's replaced with younger and more diverse, which the DNC would prefer. A messy caucus also would kill a potential campaign by a statewide campaign of a person unpopular with some key people in the national party, and people should never underestimate the power of pettiness in politics. I'm not sure I'm cynical enough to believe all of that, but there's no doubt that problems could result in benefits later down the line.

I suspect the Sanders campaign hasn't done more to fill those spots for the same reason they haven't opened up more field offices; they just aren't very organized. 

All of that said, I still believe this race could go either way. I suspect we'll have a good indication of who wins the Dem caucus fairly. Long lines lots of new registrations favor Sanders. 

My official guess: Clinton by two points. But I won't be surprised at all by a Sanders win

**Methodology:** 

This survey was conducted by telephone from January 12, 2016 through January 16, 2016 by Mason-Dixon Polling &amp; Research of Jacksonville, Florida. A total of 1,004 likely New Hampshire primary voters were interviewed statewide. By design, half of the sample consisted of likely Democratic primary voters (501) and half consisted of likely Republican primary voters (503).
  
Respondents were screened to include only those who identified themselves as registered voters in the state of New Hampshire and planned to vote in the primary.  

Results were not weighted. However, the demographic profile of both the Democratic and Republican samples aligns closely with that of participants in previous New Hampshire primary elections. 

The sample’s equal shares of likely Republican primary voters and likely Democratic primary voters aligns with the approximately equal number of registered Democrats and registered Republicans in New Hampshire as of December 2015.^1

The sampling was dual-frame, with 50% of the completed interviews conducted through random-digit-dialing of landline numbers and the remaining 50% of completed interviews conducted by randomly calling cell phone numbers that had been matched to lists of registered voters in the state of New Hampshire.  Each number, excluding disconnected numbers, was tried up to five times.  

The overall response rate was 12%, meaning that 12% of the individuals who were reached on the phone ultimately completed the survey.  The response rate was driven in part by the screening questions, which required respondents to be registered to vote in the state of New Hampshire and plan to attend a primary on February 9. Of those individuals who were reached on the phone, 26% agreed to take the survey. Of the 26% who agreed to take the survey, 45% passed the screener questions.

The margin of error for the full sample of 1,004 voters is ± 3.2%, while the margin of error for each party sample, both Republican and Democratic, is ± 4.5%.

---
^1 According to the New Hampshire Secretary of State’s Office, as of December 28, 2015, registered Republicans in New Hampshire numbered 260,896 and registered Democrats numbered 229,202.  Therefore, of total voters registered in New Hampshire as either a Republican or Democrat, 53% were Republicans and 47% were Democrats.

If people who report on this stuff every 2 years for 20+ years still botch it daily (I watched Mark Halpern do it yesterday on With All Due Respect) it certainly follows that most other people would believe the ""conventional wisdom.""
 

&gt; Clinton with 50%, Sanders with 42%, and O'Malley with 8%.

This is pedantic and no one in real life refers to it like this, but the MOE is not 4%, it's actually plus or minus four percentage points.

So what your example means: 

If we were to use identical methodology and survey the total population (all of the 150K-250K people who show up at the Democratic caucuses in IA) represented by your sample (400 or so likely dem caucus voters) 100 times, 95 of those times would produce a result for Clinton between 46% and 54%, a result for Sanders between 38% and 46%, and a result for O'Malley between 4% and 12%. 

Does that make sense?

This is why I've said that I view subsamples with more skepticism than most. And why it irritates me when people say a poll is wrong (there was a shitty article I read about this yesterday in WaPo I think that was just full of misinformation) when, in fact, the result falls within the poll's finding, but the way the poll was reported is wrong. 

Really it's the reason why I made this post.

779,"I don't know if you're familiar with AAPOR, but there is not a more reputable source of information. AAPOR is the 2,500 member governing body/professional association of survey and public opinion researchers in academics, the public and private sectors and government. They set the standards and best practices for the industry. This is who survey researchers and pollsters consult with questions. 

The primer linked in this post was written by [Cliff Zukin](http://bloustein.rutgers.edu/zukin/#tabs_562256a84ba3838d6-tab_1), who is the president of AAPOR. Please [follow this link](http://bloustein.rutgers.edu/zukin/#tabs_562256a84ba3838d6-tab_1) to read his bio, and his CV which is linked at the bottom. There are some controversial topics in survey research, but I guarantee you that the definition of MOE is not one of them. 

The reason why I lament media reporting of polls is that they manage to botch the simplest concepts. And you can throw bite sized information at them, but it still doesn't stop national veteran political reporters from ignorance of the most basic concepts. 

But if for some reason, that's not enough, this is from [NCPP](http://www.ncpp.org/node/4/#11):

&gt; Interviews with a scientific sample of 1,000 adults can accurately reflect the opinions of nearly 210 million American adults. That means interviews attempted with all 210 million adults – if such were possible – would give approximately the same results as a well-conducted survey based on 1,000 interviews.

&gt; What happens if another carefully done poll of 1,000 adults gives slightly different results from the first survey? Neither of the polls is ""wrong."" This range of possible results is called the error due to sampling, often called the margin of error.

&gt; This is not an ""error"" in the sense of making a mistake. Rather, it is a measure of the possible range of approximation in the results because a sample was used.

&gt; Pollsters express the degree of the certainty of results based on a sample as a ""confidence level."" This means a sample is likely to be within so many points of the results one would have gotten if an interview were attempted with the entire target population. Most polls are usually reported using the 95% confidence level.

&gt; Thus, for example, a ""3 percentage point margin of error"" in a national poll means that if the attempt were made to interview every adult in the nation with the same questions in the same way at the same time as the poll was taken, the poll's answers would fall within plus or minus 3 percentage points of the complete count’s results 95% of the time.

&gt; This does not address the issue of whether people cooperate with the survey, or if the questions are understood, or if any other methodological issue exists. The sampling error is only the portion of the potential error in a survey introduced by using a sample rather than interviewing the entire population. Sampling error tells us nothing about the refusals or those consistently unavailable for interview; it also tells us nothing about the biasing effects of a particular question wording or the bias a particular interviewer may inject into the interview situation. It also applies only to scientific surveys.

&gt; **Remember that the sampling error margin applies to each figure in the results – it is at least 3 percentage points plus or minus for each one in our example. Thus, in a poll question matching two candidates for President, both figures are subject to sampling error.** (emphasis added)




&gt; Sampling error raises one of the thorniest problems in the presentation of poll results: For a horse-race poll, when is one candidate really ahead of the other?
 
&gt; Certainly, if the gap between the two candidates is less than the sampling error margin, you should not say that one candidate is ahead of the other. You can say the race is ""close,"" the race is ""roughly even,"" or there is ""little difference between the candidates."" But it should not be called a ""dead heat"" unless the candidates are tied with the same percentages.   And it certainly is not a “statistical tie” unless both candidates have the same exact percentages.

&gt; And just as certainly, when the gap between the two candidates is equal to or more than twice the error margin – 6 percentage points in our example – and if there are only two candidates and no undecided voters, you can say with confidence that the poll says Candidate A is clearly leading Candidate B.

&gt; When the gap between the two candidates is more than the error margin but less than twice the error margin, you should say that Candidate A ""is ahead,"" ""has an advantage"" or ""holds an edge."" The story should mention that there is a small possibility that Candidate B is ahead of Candidate A.

&gt; When there are more than two choices or undecided voters – virtually in every poll in the real world – the question gets much more complicated.

&gt; While the solution is statistically complex, you can fairly easily evaluate this situation by estimating the error margin. You can do that by taking the sum of the percentages for each of the two candidates in question and multiplying it by the total respondents for the survey (only the likely voters if that is appropriate). This number is now the effective sample size for your judgment. Look up the sampling error in a table of statistics for that reduced sample size, and apply it to the candidate percentages. If they overlap, then you do not know if one is ahead. If they do not, then you can make the judgment that one candidate has a lead.

&gt; And bear in mind that when subgroup results are reported – women or blacks or young people – the sampling error margin for those figures is greater than for results based on the sample as a whole. Be very careful about reporting results from extremely small subgroups. Any results based on fewer than 100 respondents are subject to such large sampling errors that it is almost impossible to report the numbers in a meaningful manner. 

I guess what I'm wondering is aside from the uniformly terrible, horrible poll reporting in the media, where have you ever seen a reputable source dispute what MOE means?

From [AAPOR](http://www.aapor.org/Education-Resources/Election-Polling-Resources/Margin-of-Sampling-Error-Credibility-Interval.aspx): 

&gt; The margin of sampling error is the price you pay for not talking to everyone in the population you are targeting. It describes the range that the answer likely falls between if we had talked to everyone instead of just a sample. For example, for a probability-based telephone sample of 1,000 randomly selected adults nationwide, we are confident that the finding from the poll will be within plus or minus 3 percentage points of the answer we would have gotten had we talked to all 250 million adults.
 
&gt; So if one of the poll findings was that 58% approved of the job their Governor was doing, we would be confident that the true value would lie somewhere between 55% and 61% if we had surveyed to the whole adult population in the state.
 
&gt; To be technically correct, we really only have some degree of confidence that our margin of sampling error (MOSE) falls within the calculated range. Generally, pollsters calculate the MOSE using a 95% confidence level. That is, in 95 times out of a 100, we expect that the answer we get from the survey will fall somewhere within our margin of sampling error. But about five times out of 100 it will not--one reason findings from even the best survey should be interpreted cautiously, particularly those that are significantly different from similar polls conducted at about the same time. Also, the MOSE varies depending on the actual percentage in the population. It is largest when the population percentage is 50 percent and that is the figure pollsters typically use in reporting the MOSE.
 
&gt; Note that margin of sampling error is always expressed in percentage points, not as a percentage--for example, three percentage points and not 3%. And the margin of sampling error only applies to probability-based surveys where participants have a known and non-zero chance of being included in the sample. It does not apply to opt-in online surveys and other non-probability based polls.

810,"I'm a woman. Size is overrated. Communication, confidence, and enthusiasm are underrated. 

Some of the best sex I've ever had was with a 6'4"" black man with a pretty thin 4"" penis. He was confident, adventurous and enthusiastic. Extremely hot.

There was another 6'5"" guy with a 5"" penis and the sex was very sub-par. He was very self-conscious and timid. Not hot. Obsessing about your size or letting it affect your attitude can only have negative consequences and make things worse and awkward. Don't do that. 

I've found that women who say they only like/can be pleasured by a large penis are revealing their own sexual immaturity. If she really believes that, she probably has some more personal exploration to do because she's missing out on a lot of other solo and partnered pleasurable stuff.

Remember, most women aren't able to cum from only PIV intercourse anyway, so no matter what your size is, you're going to need do more than just stick it in. Odds are, what's happening on the outside is as/more important than what's happening on the inside. And when it comes to the inside, the most of our pleasurable nerve endings are located within the first few inches of our vaginas. 

There are lots of different ways to pleasure each other sexually, and intercourse is just one of those ways. For PIV intercourse, study up on different positions and what different options are best for your size and body types. Explore oral, fingering, anal, various toys (for you and your partner) and /r/outercourse. Make sure your foreplay game is strong. More than anything communicate with your partner about what feels good to both of you. If she has a hard time verbalizing, ask her to show you how she masturbates, or to guide your hands and body. Every woman is different and the fun part is learning exactly how.

And if we're keeping it real, odds are that if someone is that invested in a BBC stereotype, they're probably making a number of other errant assumptions about you, too. Penis size is probably not the biggest issue you're dealing with there (no pun intended).

The good news is that if you're in a position for someone to see your penis, you're also in a position to immediately prove how irrelevant size is to sexual pleasure. That's not something you get to say about most stereotypes, so really, you're ahead of the game with this one. :)",2016-01-25 11:06:11+00:00,czb3xh4,1.0,t3_42jdrs,27718.0,Blackfellas

General election turnouts are usually more than twice as large as caucus/primary turnouts. Meaning the pool of likely caucus/primary voters is twice as small as the pool of likely general election voters. 

So, if that question was to just establish a large pool of voters to call from, ok.

828,"What you're seeing is a reflection of the changing opinions of voters over time and the related difficulty of predicting who will vote. It's not pollsters somehow gaming their polls to favor one candidate or the other. 

**Determining who will vote is hard but gets easier as an election gets closer:**

Determining who is a likely voter is a very difficult thing. The further from an election it is, the harder it gets. That's because a likely voter is a theoretical group. It does not exist yet, and many factors influence what it will ultimately look like. Pollsters are attempting to survey a group that is still in the process of becoming a group. 

The most complicated part of the whole thing is that registered voters are notoriously bad at predicting their own voting behavior. That's why pollsters can't just ask someone if they plan to vote and use that as a reliable indicator that the people who say yes actually will. Research has repeatedly shown that any group of registered voters will overstate their intention to vote by 10-40%. 

But voters do get more certain about whether they will vote and who they will vote for as an election gets closer. And models that predict voting behavior are more accurate as elections get closer. So pollsters are better able to capture more accurate data from more of the people who will actually be voting as an election gets closer. 

**Opinions change over time, so opinion polls closest to an election are the most accurate:**

On top of that, people's opinions change over time. People may already be aware of a candidate with a national profile, but once an election gets close and they start paying closer attention, they will learn more about lesser know candidates. Their opinions will also be shaped by news coverage, current events and candidate advertising. All of that causes people to causes people's opinions to shift over time, so the closer to an election, the more accurate someone will be able to tell you their ultimate view on a candidate. That's why you see poll results from different pollsters begin to converge as an election gets closer. 


**Pollsters do not skew polls towards candidates; their methodology and assumptions are just off**

You speak of ""adjusting"" polls to favor a candidate. This is another area where there are a ton of misconceptions. What pollsters do in election polls is to match the composition of poll respondents to the composition of the people who will be voting in an election. But since the election hasn't yet happened, you can only use your best guess based on data from past elections.

So you can model the electorate of 2008, which included more people than usually turn out. Or 2004, or 2000, and so on. But past elections are never exactly the same as future elections. So people have to use their best guess, usually by comparing it to an election they believe is similar, and making demographic adjustments based on those projections. 

So the variance you see isn't because a pollster favors a candidate. It's because different pollsters may hold slightly different opinions about the expected demographics. So a poll that overestimates the number of young people in an election is likely to produce a result with a Sanders bias (bias is used in the statistical sense here). That in no way means the firm is in the tank for Sanders and skewed their result to favor him. It just means that they made an incorrect assumption about the composition of the electorate.

Also, people seem to not understand how pollsters make their money. Pollsters make their money by being accurate. When a media entity looks to contract a pollster, reputation matters, as it does with every other type of vendor they hire. When campaigns look to hire pollsters, they need to know that they aren't being fed BS. As Romney demonstrated to many, it's disastrous to have a pollster that overstates your support. 

There may be occasional rogue huckster firms that play fast and loose with things or even fake results, but they are never around for more than a cycle. There is no incentive for a firm to skew or fake results. It's suicide.

I was hoping we'd be done with this after the widespread conspiracy theories that all but a few polls were skewed in favor of Obama, when in fact, they were just accurate.

This kind of thinking spreads because the media does a terrible job of really explaining what a polls really mean and say. Polls do not predict the future; they express the likely (not definite) opinions of a given population at a specific point in time.

**How polls are reported versus what the poll actually says:**

Polls do not indicate certainty. They indicate probability. That's why paying attention to overall and subgroup margins of error are important. 

Take a poll that says Sanders is leading Clinton by 46%-43%, with a margin of error (MOE) of plus or minus 4.0 percentage points. The media would certainly use a headline like ""Clinton is leading Sanders,"" causing people to be surprised and call the poll wrong if Sanders lost to Clinton 42-45. But the media is doing both the pollster and the public a disservice because what the pollster is actually saying is they are confident that if you surveyed the entire population that their sample represents, 95 times out of 100, Sanders support would be between 42%-50%, and Clinton's support would be between 39% and 47%. So with the accurate result explained, Sanders losing to Clinton is within the probable outcome predicted by the pollster. 


**TL;DR:**
So basically, there's no grand conspiracy or skewing. There are just different elements of a poll that can introduce error, like how representative the sample is of the actual target population, what mode they use to collect the data (phone, internet, online), how the questions are worded, what order questions are asked, etc. Understanding how and where different error can be introduced, and what different advantages and disadvantages are with various methods helps to determine the quality of a poll. 

**More resources:**

829,"This poll is an outlier because they messed up their likely voter screen by [calling from a list of irregular general election voters](http://i.imgur.com/z6zYONm.png) and then screening poorly.  

Voters always overstate their liklihood of voting, which is the reason why almost every reputable pollster uses multiple screening questions, voting history, and/or demographic probability to assign a establish a respondent's likelihood of voting. 

Loras, on the other hand, [only asked one screening question](http://imgur.com/wvlm2WV) of the majority of respondents, then used all of them who said they were definitely or very likely to vote. Remember, this is from an irregular general election voter sample.  

Regular voters are usually defined as people who have voted in at least 3 of the last four LIKE elections. Like is the operative word. Because turnout is much lower in primary elections (and even lower in caucuses), you would define a regular caucus voter as someone who voted in 3 of the last 4 primaries/caucuses (you'd probably use both in Iowa since caucuses are only held every four years. So the pool of they started with is very broad and a non-trivial amount of people who haven't voted in 4 years. 

So basically, Loras cast a wider net than they should have, then  used an over-broad LV screen, giving them a sample of democratic leaning voters that is more broad than those who will caucus, therefore less liberal and more likely to support Clinton.

The most accurate pollster will miss beyond the MOE for at least 1 out of every 20 polls - and that's just toplines. There's more error with subsamples.

So I'm comfortable making a statement like Rasmussen had a Republican oversampling problem in 2012, which occurred in a high percentage of their polls and in a higher percentage than the average pollster. I'm not comfortable saying that about PPP from the data I've seen. Especially since PPP is an A rated pollster*, got every state right in 2012, every 2012 toss-up senate race, was the 3rd most accurate pollster for all federal races in 2012, and was the most accurate pollster in gubernatorial races in 2014. 

Now, it could turn out that they are off this cycle. We'll see where everything really stands after the votes are in. But based on recent history, PPP is one of the least likely to have those problems.

With IVR only polls, you miss out on mobile phone owners (which is significant), but people are more honest with IVR polls (that's the leading theory for why, given identical sample compositions, Trump rates higher on IVR polls). That's what lies behind the theorized [""Bradley Effect.""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_effect) You alsoget lower response and completion rates with IVR, but those are rarely consequential (with toplines, at least) because you just call larger amounts of people.

857,"This was in the field before the last debate, so it doesn't reflect any movement that may have resulted. This was a live call landline/cell phone poll (unknown mix) and the MOE for the Dem LV subset, which includes this topline result, is 4.8. 

Americans (and our media) are notorious for our relatively short attention spans, and while terror attacks propelled national security/foreign policy as the top issue to Americans in the last 2 months of last year, those fears have subsided and job/economy springboarded back as the top issue for more Americans now than at any point in the last 6 months. That plays to Sanders' strength, with 57% of likely Dem primary voters saying Sanders would handle the economy better, versus only 33% for Clinton.

Only 4% of likely Dem primary voters view gun control as the most important issue (down 2% from last month), although that has been a contrast that Clinton continues to use. Only 3% view social issues as the top priority (down 2% from last month). 

Clinton's favorability is has dropped slightly to +39 from +44 last month. Sanders sky-high favorablity has grown to +84, 10 points higher than last month. Clinton still hold a large 29 point lead in who would best handle ISIS, and that lead has held steady for the past 6 months. When asked who has the characteristics and qualities that a president should have, Sanders now has a 25 point lead over Hillary, a dramatic turnaround from 6 months ago when Clinton held a 9 point edge. It's also worth noting that 55% view as the least honest Democratic candidate, which is up 9 points in the last month, compared to Sanders holding steady at 5%. 

As I noted before, now that Clinton and Sanders have begun to directly attack each other, some slight dips in favorability/honesty numbers are to be expected, and it's my belief that Clinton will pay a larger price for going on the attack, as she did before. The only question is if she can inflict more damage to Sanders than she sustains. So far, that's a no. It will be interesting to see what effect of the Sanders health care plan and associated attacks take on him. I anticipate the FUD whipped up by the Clinton will have some effect. We'll just have to see how much. Very negative campaigns also have a negative effect on turnout, so we'll have to see how that plays out too.  

I personally think it was not strategically wise to release his health care plan before Iowa, because it's much easier to message against it than for it, and the attacks on his plan also attack his greatest areas of comparative strength (like handling the economy) but we'll see how that turns out for him. Health care is the top issue for 10% of likely voters, but we don't have any further information to tell how much the desire for single-payer reform is among them.

As I also noted before, this race will rest on the strength of the Sanders field and GOTV operations. Sanders enjoys his biggest advantages among groups who are less likely to vote overall than Clinton voters. The Sanders campaign will have to expend more resources and effort to turn out their base than the Clinton campaign, and the Clinton campaign has a very strong field operation. 

This has got to feel a lot like January 2008 for the Clinton camp.

862,"&gt; The poll shows deep support for Trump, who leads both in every age group and in every category of ideology. He leads among respondents who say they are very conservative, conservative, moderate, and liberal. This may be in part due to the huge number of Florida GOP voters who watched the recent debate on FOX Business Network.

&gt; Nearly 70 percent of those polled said they watched the debate and of those who viewed it nearly 37 percent declared Trump the winner. Cruz came in second at 25 percent and Rubio in third at 17 percent.

&gt; These races remain very fluid, but for the moment, Florida's results are very similar to those of our poll released this weekend of South Carolina likely GOP voters, where Trump enjoyed virtually the same lead that he has in this poll of Florida Republicans.

&gt; It should be noted that the two candidates from Florida are pulling a combined 25 percent of the vote, which suggests that if one of them takes a solid lead of the other in earlier states, that candidate might be a significant player in the Florida primary.",2016-01-19 11:45:04+00:00,cz3tvs4,1.0,t3_41o963,97.0,Forecast2016
863,"I haven't been able to track down the actual poll yet, so I can't answer this one for sure. 

National polls are more about sentiment than specifics anyway, so it's usually not worth the energy to really dive in and figure them out.

It is worth it for the state polls, and the biggest variable is the turnout model each pollster weights toward. How many non-party-affiliated and first time voters are going to turn out and for whom? 

Trump and Sanders are presenting some of the same issues for us that Obama did because there is not a ""standard"" or ""common"" model that you can weight towards in an election that's as unprecedented as this. This is coming at a time when there's a lot of change in our methods anyway, because half of America no longer has landlines, the other half barely answers them, and the industry is still on the front end of figuring out the right mix and method of online polling.

866,"Actually, garlic has been found to be as effective as the leading prescription antibiotic for BV. Garlic is [well-known for it's anti-bacterial properties](http://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/herb/garlic). Some probiotics could also be as effective as the leading BV antibiotics. 

I don't know if you just had a kneejerk reaction to an ""herbal"" treatment you were unfamiliar with or , but garlic -- either orally or as a suppository -- is absolutely a viable treatment option for BV.  It's important that people confirm their BV diagnosis, but once they do, it can be a great maintenance or treatment option, especially for people with chronic issues or people who experience side effects from the antiobiotics. 


Sources: 

[Comparing the Therapeutic Effects of Garlic Tablet and Oral Metronidazole on Bacterial Vaginosis: A Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4166107/)

* Conclusions: This study reveals that garlic could be a suitable alternative for metronidazole in treatment of BV in those interested in herbal medicines or those affected by side effects of metronidazole.

[The effects of antimicrobial therapy on bacterial vaginosis in non-pregnant women](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19588379)

* Conclusions: Clindamycin preparations, oral metronidazole, and oral and intravaginal tablets of lactobacillus were effective for bacterial vaginosis. Hydrogen peroxide douche and triple sulphonamide cream were ineffective. Metronidazole caused metallic taste, nausea and vomiting. We need better-designed trials with larger sample sizes to test the effectiveness of promising drugs.

[A comparative study of the therapeutic effects of the Zataria multiflora vaginal cream and metronidazole vaginal gel on bacterial vaginosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18824338#)

* Conclusions: Patients' complication and their Amsel's criteria were significantly decreased after treatment with Z. multiflora or metronidazole (p&lt;0.05). Relative risk for unresponsiveness to treatment with Z. multiflora, to unresponsiveness to metronidazole was 1.5, which was not significant. Therapeutic effects of Z. multiflora vaginal cream are similar to metronidazole vaginal gel on BV. Therefore it could be an appropriate choice to BV treatment for those interested in herbal medicines or those affected by side effects of metronidazole.

&gt; The issue comes down to a conflict between minding the health of populations vs. individuals. Federal regulators naturally care about setting policies that represent the most cost-effective way of protecting the overall population. And to be fair, the research has failed to provide evidence that recommending all older women get vaccinated against HPV fits that bill. Drug maker Merck's study of women 24-45 did show that the vaccine protects those with no prior exposure to the nastiest HPV strains, but taking the study participants as a whole -- an analogy for the overall population of women 24-45 -- not so much. So, the CDC recommends the vaccine just for females ages 11 to 26 and males ages 11 to 21. ",2016-01-19 02:10:25+00:00,cz3ge35,7.0,t1_cz3dm8d,4521.0,sex

871,"This is false, and dangerously so. [From the CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/hpv/parents/questions-answers.html):

&gt; Q: **Is the vaccine still effective if you have had sexual intercourse?**

&gt; A: Even if someone has already had sex, they should still get HPV vaccine. Even though HPV infection usually happens soon after someone has sex for the first time, a person might not be exposed to any or all of the HPV types that are in the vaccine. Males and females in the age groups recommended for vaccination are likely to get at least some protection from the vaccine.

&gt; Q: **Who should get HPV vaccine?**

&gt; A: All girls and boys who are 11 or 12 years old should get the recommended series of HPV vaccine. Teen boys and girls who did not get the vaccine when they were younger should get it now. Young women can get HPV vaccine through age 26, and young men can get vaccinated through age 21. The vaccine is also recommended for

* gay and bisexual young men (or any young man who has sex with men) through age 26 and
* young men with weakened immune systems (including HIV) through age 26, if they did not get HPV vaccine when they were younger.


&gt; Q: **Should boys get HPV vaccine too?**

&gt; A: Two HPV vaccines—Gardasil® and Gardasil® 9—are also recommended for boys. These vaccines help prevent boys from getting infected with the types of HPV than can cause cancers of the back of the throat, penis, and anus. The vaccine also prevents genital warts. When boys are vaccinated, they are less likely to spread HPV to their current and future partners.

&gt; Q: **How many types of HPV are there?**

&gt; A: More than 40 HPV types can infect the genital areas of males and females. These HPV types can also infect the mouth and throat. Most people who become infected with HPV do not know they have it.

&gt; Q: **How common is HPV?**

&gt; A: HPV is the most common sexually-transmitted infection in the US. HPV is so common that nearly all sexually active men and women will get at least one type of HPV at some point in their lives. Most people never know that they have been infected and may give HPV to a partner without knowing it. About 79 million Americans are currently infected with HPV. About 14 million people become newly infected each year.

&gt; Q: **If HPV infection is so common, is it really that bad?**

&gt; A: Most people with HPV never develop symptoms or health problems. Most HPV infections (9 out of 10) go away by themselves within two years. But, sometimes, HPV infections will persist and can cause certain cancers and other diseases. HPV infections can cause:

* cancers of the cervix, vagina, and vulva in women;
* cancers of the penis in men;
* and cancers of the anus and back of the throat, including the base of the tongue and tonsils (oropharynx) in women and men.

&gt; HPV can also cause genital warts in men and women. The types of HPV that can cause genital warts are not the same as the types of HPV that can cause cancers.

The 
Monmouth University Poll
 was sponsored and conducted by the Monmouth University Polling Institute from January 7 to 
10, 2016 with a statewide random sample of 413 New Hampshire voters drawn from a list of registered Democrats and 
independent voters who participated in a primary election in the past two election cycles or voted in both the 2012 and 2014 
general elections, and indicate they will vote in the Democratic presidential primary in February 2016.  This was 
supplemented by a sample of new voters who say they are likely to
 register and vote in the Democratic primary.  This includes 
290 contacted by a live interviewer on a landline telephone 
and 123 contacted by a live interviewer on a cell phone, in 
English.  Monmouth is responsible for all aspects of the survey design, data weighting and analysis. Final sample is weighted 
for age and gender based on state registration list information on the pool of voters who participate in primary elections. Data 
collection support provided by Braun Research (field) and Aristotle
 (voter list and non-voter sample). For results based on the
total sample, one can say with 95% confidence that the error attributable to sampling has a maximum margin of plus or minus 
4.8 percentage points (unadjusted for sample design). Sampling error can be larger for sub-groups (see table below). In 
addition to sampling error, one should bear in mind that question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can 
introduce error or bias into the findings of opinion polls.

936,"What I found notable:

* **Sanders is maintaining his base**: Sanders retains his sizable advantage among registered independents and new voters, men, and younger voters.

* **Is Clinton's base eroding?** This poll shows Sanders has overtaken Clinton among registered Democrats, women, and voters age 50 and older. Although there is evidence that Sanders is gaining support, this results  currently outliers and I would to see similar results for Dems, women, and seniors in other polls before I believe it.

* **Clinton is likeable enough, Sanders even more so:** Likely primary voters continue to have overwhelmingly positive views of both Sanders (90% favorable - 6% unfavorable) and Clinton (73% favorable - 19% unfavorable). These results represent a very slight uptick for Sanders and a very slight dip for Clinton since November. O’Malley holds a 38% favorable and 20% unfavorable rating, which is basically unchanged from two months ago. Now that Clinton and Sanders are more directly attacking each other, it will be interesting to see how that impacts their favorablity. 

* **Pounding the flesh and flirting with the other side:** One-third (34%) of primary voters report having seen 
at least one of the presidential candidates in person, with 22% attending a Clinton event and 22% seeing Sanders in the flesh.  O’Malley has personally met 6% of the electorate. Interestingly, likely Democratic voters also report having spent some time hanging with the GOP field, including Jeb Bush (3%), Donald Trump (3%), Chris Christie (2%), Ben Carson (2%), John Kasich (2%), and Marco Rubio (2%). The conventional wisdom has been that Clinton has a superior ground game to everyone else, but Sanders has matched her in personal touches so far. It will be interesting to see whether/how that translates to contacts from the campaign and GOTV. If Sanders wins GOTV, he wins NH (if he wins or finishes very close in IA).

* **It's still the economy, stupid:** The top issue for Granite State Democrats in deciding who to support, according to the Monmouth poll, is the economy and jobs (29% first choice / 19% second choice), followed by national security and terrorism (14% / 12%), health care (11% / 16%), social issues (10% / 9%), and education (9% / 11%).  Taxes and spending (5% / 8%), gun ownership (4% / 6%), immigration (2% / 3%), and drug addiction (2% / 3%) rank much farther down the list. I wish they would have asked about gun control as well as gun ownership since that's a major line of attack Clinton is attempting to use against Sanders. Given that she's using it, I assume that it polled well internally, but it does not look as if that attack has made inroads so far. 

* **Locking in:** With one month to go, 84% of Dem LVs are either completely decided or have a strong preference for the candidate they support, and only 16% have a slight preference or are undecided.

943,"The ""Lean"" includes registered voters. 

That section I quoted in my previous reply is from the same section as the ""967 Americans."" You can see that HuffPo also lists this an an RV poll. Interestingly, RCP has this listed as an LV poll. I wonder if that's just a typo, or if (like me) they know/suspect that there were some additional screens included, but not disclosed. Given this pollster's reputation/results, I'd be surprised if they didn't. Still, I can only evaluate this poll based on what is disclosed and I'll also need to see others with similar results to have confidence these numbers.

Fwiw, the higher than average number of cell phone respondents (59%) in this sample and what I suspect is a higher % of independents are my top suspects for why this poll's Dem results are tighter than others.

You mentioned the MOE for the subsample being high, but it's actually pretty standard for most of the polls we've seen. A trend I've noticed in this cycle is to bury the real-MOE lede with a generic MOE taken from a non-partisan question asked of an overbroad population. So the main reported MOE is going to be more in line with what we're used to seeing in past cycles - usually under 4% or a CI greater than 95%. Then they disclose sub-sample MOEs which are usually over 4%. The problem is that the sub-sample MOE are rarely if ever disclosed in the media even though the horserace question they're reporting on uses a sub-sample with a higher MOE.

For example: 

* The latest [Ipsos/Reuters poll](http://www.ipsos-na.com/download/pr.aspx?id=15204) has sample of 1754 Americans a credibility interval of ±2.7%, but the horserace questions are based on subsamples with a CI of ±4.2% for Dems, ±4.4% for Republicans, and ±7.2% for Independents.

* The last [Fox Poll](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/interactive/2016/01/08/fox-news-poll-national-presidential-race-obama-ratings/) sample of 1,006 RVs with a ±3.0 MOE is listed on the first page of their memo. However, the the LV results for the GOP/DEM presidential caucuses are based on smaller subgroups with MOEs of 4.5/5.0, respectively.

* The latest NBC [News/WSJ/Marist poll](http://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/misc/IApolls/IA160102/NBC%20News_WSJ_Marist%20Poll_Iowa%20Adults%20and%20Registered%20Voters_Nature%20of%20the%20Sample%20and%20Tables_January%202016.pdf#page=1) has a sample of 3033 adults with a ±1.8 MOE. However, the horserace questions ask of the LV subsamples have MOEs of ±4.6 and ±4.8.

* The latest [CNN poll](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2015/images/12/23/cnnpoll2.pdf) lists a sample of 1018 adults with a ±3.0 MOE. However, the subgroups used in the horserace questions have an MOE ≤±8.5.

This is the reason why I try to link the full methodology, or at least list the MOE for the question I'm posting about. At least half of the time, it's higher than the topline MOE listed for the poll.

I completely agree that the only useful polls for horserace questions are those using LV screens. I'm also heavily biased in favor of using voter file data to both verify RV status and to weight LV probability, as polls using that method have proven more accurate in recent elections.

I'm very curious to see how this years DMR poll results turn out since Ann Seltzer does not believe in using voter file data.

&gt; “Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have been within 2-3 points of each other on our last two New Hampshire polls,” said Dean Debnam, President of Public Policy Polling. “Clinton is dominant with the Democratic establishment, but Sanders is proving to be more appealing to people outside the party. **It may come down to how many of those non-Democrats he can get to come out and choose to vote in the Democratic race rather than the Republican one that’s drawn a lot more interest.**” (emphasis mine)

952,"PPP polls and poll memos are often a bit meatier than others, so I'll just headline and cut/paste snippets that I feel are interesting:

* **Establishment split enables Trump's lead**:  The establishment split is 
what's keeping Trump in such a good position. In a 
pared down field of the candidates genera
lly viewed as the to
p 3 in the overall 
race Trump would lead Rubio by just 2 poin
ts, 36/34, with Cruz back at 19%. And 
Trump trails Rubio 52/40 and Cruz 46/39 in head to head match ups while 
leading Bush just 46/45. But as long as Rubio and Christie and Kasich and Bush 
are all in the race they're splitting the vo
te enough to let Trump's passionate base 
give him a big lead. 

* **Establishment candidates (even Bush) gain the most**: The candidates with the biggest gains since our last poll in early December are 
Bush (up 5 points from 5% to 10%), Rubio (up 4 points from 11% to 15), and 
Kasich (up 3 points from 8% to 11%). 
Bush and Kasich have also had notable 
gains in their favorability ratings. Bush
 has gone from negative territory last 
month (38/45) to positive ground (44/42).
 It may not sound like much but it's 
been a long time since we found Bush with an above water favorability anywhere. 
Kasich's improved from 38/35 to 46/30. 

* **Ben Carson goes boom**: The bottom's dropped out on Ben Carson wh
ose support has gone from 9% to 4% 
and whose favorability has gone from 52
/30 to 48/34. 

* **Cruz shows strength amid slip**: Interestingly the other 
candidate whose seen his support drop is
 Ted Cruz, who's gone from 13% to 10% 
with his favorability remaining steady at
 54/29 this month to 53/28 last month. 
Cruz is still pretty well positioned over
all though. He's the most frequent second 
choice of voters in the state at 17% to 11% each for Bush and Rubio, and 10% for 
Christie. More importantly he's the ov
erwhelming back up pick of Trump 
supporters at 37% to 10% for Rubio with no 
one else in double digits. If Cruz wins 
Iowa and it causes Trump voters to be 
demoralized, he's easily the candidate 
most likely to see his supporters come their way.  

* **A quarter of GOP primary voters support the anti-government armed militia occupying federal land in Oregon**: 27% of GOP primary voters in the state 
say they support the Oregon protesters 
who have taken over a federal building 
in Oregon to 39% who say they oppose 
them and 34% who don't have an opinion 
either way. Cruz voters (50/24) are 
strongly in favor of their efforts while 
Trump voters (32/33) are pretty evenly 
divided. Rubio (25/43), Kasich (20/41), Ch
ristie (20/38), and Bush (6/75) voters 
all express strong opposition to the protests. 

* **20% of GOP primary voters think Obama will take all Americans' guns away**: 20% of GOP primary voters in the state say they think Obama is going to take all Americans' guns away during his final year in office to 64% who think he will not. Rubio voters (29%) are actually most likely to have this belief followed by 25% of Trump's, 24% each of Cruz and Christie's, then all the way down to 10% of 
Kasich's and 9% of Bush's. 

* **Half of GOP primary voters are offended by bilingual menus**:   52% of GOP primary voters say they're 
offended by bilingual phone menus, to 
40% who say they aren't. This is actually
 a big dividing line in the GOP race. 
Among voters who aren't offended by ha
ving to press 1 for English and 2 for 
Spanish, the race is tied with Rubio and 
Trump each at 19%, Bush at 14%, Kasich 
at 13%, Christie at 11%, and Cruz at ju
st 6%. But among voters who are offended 
by such things, Trump leads with an ov
erwhelming 36% to 13% for Cruz, 12% for 
Christie, 11% for Rubio, 8% for 
Kasich, and just 6% for Bush.  

* **Independents may decided Dem race**: There's an 
incredible divide between the Democrats 
and independents planning to vote in 
the primary- Clinton leads Sanders 55/36 with Democrats, but Sanders almost 
completely cancels that out with a 59/29 advantage among non-Democrats 
planning to vote in the primary. That's 
just one of several big dividers in the 
Democratic race- Clinton leads 51/38 
with women while Sanders leads 50/42 
with men, and Clinton leads 54/36 with 
seniors while Sanders is up 46/45 with 
everyone else. 

* **Sanders is more liked; Clinton has more loyalty**: Sanders is more broadly popular than Clinton, with an 85/8 favorability rating to 
her 69/24 standing. Clinton's supporters are a little more committed though with 68% of them saying they will definitely vote for her to 62% of Sanders' voters who say they're firmly with him. ",2016-01-07 02:18:58+00:00,cyoum1c,1.0,t3_3zt6oy,1354.0,Forecast2016

954,"This is an online poll of adults, including registered voters (not likely voters). We all know the very limited usefulness of national polls, but I posted this because it's a weekly tracking poll that will release results every Tuesday through 2016, so it can be useful for tracking trends in national sentiment. 

[This is what stood out to me the most](http://i.imgur.com/LgOxyg9.jpg) in the poll. There's a lot of talk about the race to be the leading ""establishment"" candidate in IA/NH/SC, on the assumption that the establishment frontrunner will absorb the donors and supporters of the lagging establishment candidates, setting up a race between the leading outsider and establishment candidate for the GOP nomination. These results suggest that voters backing an establishment candidate as their first choice may be as/more likely to support an outsider as a second choice; more bad news for those wanting an establishment nominee. Of course, in this poll of national registered voters, that could have more to do with the amount of media coverage the candidates are receiving because most of these voters don't have an impending primary and aren't yet paying close attention. But it will be interesting to see how these numbers move in this poll (especially post-IA/NH) and compare with other state-based and LV polls.

976,"This is an online poll. I was going to write about why I wrote such a tortured breakdown of the sample in the title, but it was turning into a tortured explanation of their method, so I thought I'd just skip that and include the method.

**HOW THE POLL WAS CONDUCTED AND THE MARGIN OF ERROR CALCULATED**

The CBS News 2016 Battleground Tracker is a panel study based on interviews conducted on the internet of registered voters in Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. The poll was conducted by YouGov, an online polling organization.

The ﬁrst wave was ﬁelded between September 3-10, 2015, with 4860 respondents, and the second waveﬁeldwork was completed between October 15-22, 2015, with 3952 respondents and the third wave between November 15-19, 2015. The fourth wave was ﬁelded between December 13-17, 2015. The majority of the2nd-4th wave respondents are recontacted panelists. Respondents were selected from YouGovs and two other online panels. These are “opt-in” panels which are open for anyone to join. However, YouGov also randomly selected persons from voter registration lists who had previously voted in primary elections and contacted them by phone. A total of 22517 registered voters were contacted by phone and the YouGov sample includes 1753 phone recruits.

[Total interviews](http://i.imgur.com/9sAyoAy.png)

For the October, November, and December waves, all respondents from previous waves were contacted to participate. Recontact rates ranged from 42% to 53% for each state. In addition, new respondents were selected from the YouGov panel each wave. Approximately 60% of the October wave consists of reinterviews, with the remainder coming from new additions. Approximately 70% of the November wave consists of reinterviews from the previous waves, and approximately 90% of the December wave consists of reinterviews. 

[Recontacts and New Interviews](http://i.imgur.com/5Y9bvO6.png)

Respondents were selected for participation from available panel members to be representative of registered voters from each state in terms of age, race, and gender. A propensity score (based upon a case-control logistic regression including age, race, gender, education, born-again status, and party registration) was estimated for each respondent and responding panelists were post-stratifed upon propensity score deciles, and adjusted for diﬀerential recontact from the prior wave. A score for likelihood of voting was computed for each respondent based upon past turnout and self-reported likelihood of voting in the presidential primary.

Finally, the product of the base weights and turnout probabilities were raked to match parameters from past primary and general elections in the state drawn from exit polls, and aggregate parameters from the current voter ﬁle. The weights were trimmed to have a maximum value of seven.


 
The “margin of error” is an approximate 95 percent conﬁdence interval for the sampling proportion. It is calculated for a sample proportion using [this formula](http://i.imgur.com/ieq0QKI.png), 
where CV is the coeﬃcient of variation of the sample weights and n is the sample size used to compute the proportion. 

This is a measure of sampling error (the average of all estimates obtained using the same sample selection and weighting procedures repeatedly should, in principle, be within the margin of error in95 percent of such samples). It does not reﬂect non-sampling errors, including potential selection bias in panel participation or in response to a particular survey. The validity of the margin of error for total survey error (including non-sampling error) requires that, after controlling for the sample selection and weighting variables, survey measurements be independent of sample selection.

984,"&gt; But when almost all the polls are telling you almost the exact same thing for weeks if not months on end (i.e. Clinton up by 25-30 points nationally versus Sanders)

It should never be assumed that national polls reflect the reality within individual states, even if there's a consensus among national polls. In this cycle, there is not even a polling consensus. One could develop in the next six weeks, but right now there isn't. 

Just look at the poll results over the past *two weeks*:

* IA Dem: Clinton +14, Clinton +9, Clinton +11, Clinton +22, Clinton +18
* IA GOP: Cruz +10, Cruz +2, Trump +1, Trump +3, Cruz +11,  Cruz +5, Trump +13 

* NH Dem: Sanders +10%, Clinton +2
* NH GOP: Trump +15, Trump +18, Trump +20

* Natl Dem: Clinton +33, Clinton +20, Clinton +19, Clinton +18, Clinton +32, Clinton +27,   Clinton +18, Clinton +28
* Natl GOP:  Trump +19, Trump +5, Trump +27,  Trump +23, Trump +10, Trump +12, Trump +20

Those numbers are all over the place and obviously some of these polls are *very* wrong. In the face of numbers that are this different, the only reasonable thing to do is examine the polling methods. And some methods are absolutely more sound and representative than others. 

Polling isn't about picking a winner (it can be used for that, but that's not its purpose). That belief is what causes a lot of the existing problems with the way media reports on polls. The purpose of polling is to accurately represent the opinions of a population at a given moment in time. Being off by 5% outside of the MOE is a significant problem, and some of these polls are off by 10 or more points. Errors of that magnitude on a national level sully reputations and make firms have to publicly account for their errors. 

I also agree with /u/solmakou that it's troublesome that non-representative polls are being used to determine things as consequential as nationally televised debate participation.

1034,"Well, I guess it depends on what you consider borrowing. A couple years back I had a friend with NFL SundayTicket and I paid the extra $100 bucks for the Max add-on (the streaming/mobile option). So with that, Apple TV, Netflix, Plex and my HD antenna, I was set. Now I also have a Chromecast.

That's all legal and HD. And less expensive annually than 5 months of cable, which includes the cost of upgrading the Chromecast/AppleTV hardware.

Now with Hulu, HBO Now, and other packages, it's getting better and easier all the time. My issue isn't necessarily with paying for anything, I just don't enjoy being forced to pay a huge amount to companies when less than 10% of their product is valuable to me. 

I also don't like subsidizing cable companies because that only helps them to continue to stifle competition and innovation, and prevent access to a la carte options. Cable prices are artificially high because they are still powerful enough to lobby for monopolies/duopolies.

Now I get more for less. Cutting the cord was a win all around for me.

1112,"I've been the unicorn for a few couples and found a unicorn using Adult Friend Finder and they were AWESOME. It helps that you can sometimes see what other couples had to say about the people.

A word of advice: go for a paid membership (just the basic one, for the shortest term, which I believe is a month, which is usually enough time).  It shows people you're serious and helps you cut through the clutter. I've recommended this to friends and everyone who had a paid membership wound up happy.

I have known a couple of people who found FWBs through free memberships, but it took a bit longer. I just like to get down to business, so paying was worth it to me. ",2015-10-25 18:54:19+00:00,cwcgc1w,1.0,t3_3q64ri,5147.0,sex

1118,"This is a very common fantasy, both for people who have been sexually assaulted and those who haven't. It's one of my fantasies.

For some, it's about empowerment. Many people feel compelled to take control of a situation that they were previously powerless in, and gain some pleasure from it. It can be an effective way of dealing with trauma.
For others, it's about being turned on by aspects of submission, taboo, or pushing boundaries.

It's important to understand that even in the most extreme roleplay scenarios, this is a *fantasy*. Even in extremely rough, surprise, or violent scenarios, there is established prior consent. It's not in the same universe as real life sexual assault and does not mean that a person who enjoys this, from the giving or receiving end, enjoys or desires *actual* sexual assault.

The problem in your scenario, OP, is that this brought up real life trauma that you experienced with your parents, and that made this something that doesn't just turn you off, but repulsed you. If this is ever brought up by any of your partners again, you should communicate that this isn't something you're interested in, and they should respect that. It sounds like that conversation didn't happen in this scenario, and underscores why communication is so important overall, and especially with extreme kinks.

There have been some informative threads and articles about this:

1119,"I'm most comfortable in relationships that are emotionally monogamous but sexually open, with agreed upon boundaries. 

Love and sex are two separate things and don't necessarily have to coexist. In fact, enjoying others can actually be a very emotional, loving and bonding experience with my partner. 

There's also a misconception that people in non-monogamous relationship want to cheat or don't want to commit. That's far from the truth in healthy relationships. Honesty and respect are as, if not more, important in non-monogamous relationships. Everything falls apart without it. 

People need to be in the type of relationship they prefer. The craziest thing to me is people who condemn or shame two consenting adults for the type of relationship they prefer to be in. Just because it's not right for you doesn't mean there's something wrong with it.

I was looking for a lower cost vibe but decided to get this, and I'm very thankful I did. I also save a lot on batteries since this is rechargeable. 

You can read more on the site, but I can't recommend this highly enough if you're looking for quality clitoral stimulation.

1290,"90%+ of porn masturbation is with fingers, dildos or vibrators. According to several commenters I've seen, using anything different than those things is ""weird"" or ""fucked up."" Some people don't make it beyond that 90%+ and others dismiss the rest as abnormal because it's not in the majority.

I've also seen several comments wondering how girls can possibly enjoy masturbation without inserting anything into our vaginas. (!!!)

1404,"There are two contexts for pussy slapping for me. The first is more like tapping, and it just feels good. It's pressure and stimulation on my clit. I imagine someone tapping your dick would get its attention.

The other is in more of a submissive role. I enjoy pleasing a dominant man. I enjoy taking what he wants to give me and pushing my boundaries (within reason...kind of). In that way, pussy slapping is similar to spanking to me. It's pleasurable stimulation with an edge. 

The real question: WHY NOT?

1450,"He said he felt it when doing his come hither motion:

&gt; So I go in with 2 fingers, palm up, and start bringing the 2 fingers towards me.

There are a lot of misconceptions about the [position of the cervix](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Gray1166.png) relative to the vagina and how they aren't linear. Have you ever put in a Diva Cup or similar device? (BTW, you should, I *highly* recommend it) That perfectly illustrates the position of the cervix and what he felt.  

The location of the cervix is a little more complicated than just being at the ""back"". It's position relative to the vagina changes based on the position you're in. If a woman is bent at the hips at all, it's not exactly at the back (which is why when you insert a Diva Cup you slide it behind your cervix and then let it expand to the front - which is the same path his fingers took). It's like a backwards L or an upside down T with one much shorter side, with the cervix being vertical and the vaginal canal being horizontal.  The cervix feels like it's located in the anterior/top/front side of the vagina, because you slide in under it, get in behind it and feel it on top/above. The cervix is also very accessible when the vagina isn't yet lengthened. 

So he inserted his fingers with his palm up arriving at her posteror fornix, where the cervix would have been located on the ""top"" or ""front"" where the pads of his fingers are he and moved across her cervix when he moved his fingers up and forward in the come hither motion. That's why it felt like a ""sac.""",2015-09-01 21:22:33+00:00,cungl47,4.0,t1_cunfdj6,1864.0,sex

It feels like he described (which the gspot definitely doesn't), some women enjoy stimulation of their cervix (although I don't) and he describes a posterior fornix orgasm, and her cervix would obviously move deeper back during their activities since the vagina lengthens from arousal. The gspot would never be inaccessible with fingers.

1454,"For me and many others, it has nothing to do with trying to prevent cheating or maintain control. That statement reflects a common but incorrect assumption that cheating isn't possible in non-monogamous relationships.

Many of us form emotional bonds independent of physical ones. My guy being with another woman isn't threatening to me and it's a huge turn on. In fact, sharing that kind of openness and experience can bring people closer together.

I don't get sexually jealous, but I'm most comfortable in emotionally monogamous relationships. Being cheated on in non-monogamous relationships hurts just as much as monogamous cheating.

It's normal. It's okay to want to diversify how you masturbate, but please do so with the understanding that you're not abnormal.

I made /r/GirlsHumpingThings because I used to think similarly about humping things before I found out that it's common.

You enjoy pressure against your vagina, so other methods involving pressure are going to be your easiest next steps. 

I'd recommending masturbating my humping things and using a vibrator (Some good informational links have been provided by others). With your bf, you can try riding him while leaning forward against him, which will let you grind your clit against him, which is a similar kind of stimulation.

1647,"Your donation was under the minimum dollar limit for reporting, so your transaction wouldn't have been pulled for further research in any instance. However, the problem you detail is a system-wide one which hasn't been fixed because it's harder to verify someone's information than you think. 

There is no verification of CC donations in any campaign. People can give whatever information they want. The credit card processor basically verifies the person's name and address, but it's hard to do much else. Donations that must be reported and have incomplete information are researched further, and a best effort is made to track down all of the information. Donations that don't meet requirements are refunded in most cases. You usually hear about the cases that aren't. One of the benefits of disclosing donors (that meet the minimum reporting threshold) is that anyone can see and research the donors on the list. 

That's why you have to self certify that the info you've given is accurate, you're donating your own funds and that you're eligible to donate (or similar terms). This certification by the donor is a requirement in some jurisdictions because that's the best verification that's possible.

It may sound odd, but to me it's similar to eating together while in the middle of a disagreement. We may not be laughing or talking much, but even when we're unhappy with each other, we can still enjoy the food.

1666,"&gt; if Reddit were a company, and a manager was looking at this...they'd throw it back to the devs to get it fixed. Inconsistency between company site pages is pretty much suicide as a web developer at any company I've worked with.

Reddit *is* a company and they realize that having different communities with their own looks and feels is a benefit to the site and not a detriment. They're grown *because* of it. That's why they allow every sub to modify some elements of their pages. The things that Reddit believes are critical to the user experience are not able to be modified. And they give everyone the option to have uniform customization by turning off customized subreddit CSS.

I found the userbar to be very intuitive even with this customization. It's in the same general place with the same general look. I do think the subscribe button issue raised elsewhere is legitimate, and he's addressing that in the next release. 

There are issues I have with naut, reddit and everything else, but sometimes you just have to realize that some things that are a big deal for you aren't issues for most others.

1675,"It's normal for a girl's clit to become more sensitive the more aroused she is. You'd have to ask your girlfriend, but it could be that she's more comfortable and close to you now, so she's more aroused than she used to be, which would mean she gets more sensitive than she used to be.

The tone of your question and reply make it seem like you want to keep directly stimulating her clit. The only ""wrong"" thing to do is to continue with her clit.

You're interpreting this as she no longer loves your hand and mouth, like it's a blow to your ego. You seem to be trying to make this about you and what you're doing and how you can get her back to the place where you can stimulate her clit like you want to. 

Don't do that. It's not about what you think she should enjoy, this is about what she's telling you she enjoys (and doesn't enjoy).

I'm sure she is fine with your mouth and hands when you aren't doing what she says doesn't feel good or hurts her. There are lots of ways you can stimulate her without messing with her clit. 

You can lick around the hood of her clit, lick and play with her inner and outer lips, finger her insider her vagina, cup and lick her entire vulva. Instead of using the tip of your fingers and tongue, use the palm of your hand, pads of your fingers, and broad flat strokes with your tongue.

1718,"Thank you. I used to be horrible at making things like that look nice but I'm working on improving, so that compliment means a lot. 

I tried your suggestion and it did make the button background the correct color, but the text remained dark instead of light like the other buttons, and the background turned white on hover.

After some trial and error, I ended up doing this (I don't know how to format it nicely like you did):
    
    .side .titlebox .md h6:last-of-type a:first-of-type, .side .titlebox .md h6:last-of-type a:nth-of-type(2) {text-align: center;font-size: 9px;color: #fff;font-weight: 900;font-family: normal x-small verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;border-radius: 2px;position: absolute;right: 10px;z-index: 9999999;width: 80px;height: 18px;transition: .25s ease;box-shadow: 0 1px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.24)!important;top: 34px;background: #eee;z-index: 9999;}
    .side .titlebox .md h6:last-of-type a:first-of-type, .side .titlebox .md h6:last-of-type a:nth-of-type(2) { background-color: #582A72 }    

I added ""color: #fff;"" to the first line and changed the color to #582a72 on the second line. 

Was this the best way to do it?

EDIT: I chose Naut because I really like the way it looks without modifications and because there were a lot of existing modification addons, so I could modify it pretty easily with no prior experience, and they also make it easier to upgrade the theme without my changes being overwritten. I could be mistaken about any of those, but that was my understanding. What important parts lack formatting?",2015-08-15 01:37:51+00:00,cu3h46m,2.0,t1_cu2apfo,86684.0,csshelp

1722,"Thanks for your reply. 

I replaced [line 149](https://www.reddit.com/r/HotForMyDaddy/about/stylesheet/) with the line you provided above and it made the button the correct color, but the text was still dark. So I added ""color: #555;"" to the line above it (line 148) which fixed the text color. 

Was this the best way to do that? 

(I previously tried adding your line below the other three (on line 151), which made the box the right color but the text was still dark. When I added ""color: #555;"" to line 148, it made the background of the button #555 color on hover, so I changed to the method l detailed above.)

Man, was that wrong. I received it via IV, and *immediately* went on an incredibly intense roller coaster ride in my head. I was gripping the hospital bed railing to steady myself, which of course wasn't working. I'm not exactly sure how long that lasted, but it was probably just a few minutes.

Masturbating by humping things. That's why /r/GirlsHumpingThings exists.

Favorite spots on my body to be touched?

My entire body kind of turns into an erogenous zone when I'm horny, but my clothes seem to instantly disappear when my neck is kissed/nuzzled, my ears are licked/sucked, or the inside of my forearms are caressed. I just love feeling big manly hands all over my body. I love being held, guided, or gripped firmly.

What gets me going the fastest?

Dominance and dirty talk.

Which orgasms are strongest?

The orgasms I have when I'm riding him and grinding my clit on him are the sharpest. My most powerful orgasms are when my g-spot is stimulated or in some situations when I continue to stimulate my clit all the way through an orgasm and I have a second heightened orgasm on top of it.",2015-08-05 09:34:20+00:00,cts53fg,1.0,t3_3ftoov,27320.0,sex
1842,"Whoa, there's a lot of hostility in here. 

I definitely understand the inclination to fake. Guys take it *very* personally because it is technically being dishonest, even though most women do it for their guy's benefit (that's the intention, at least).

The problem is the only person you are hurting and shortchanging is yourself. 

I've always had a *very* high sex drive, but when I was younger I couldn't climax with others. Sex still felt great and I loved it, I just didn't orgasm from it. It was only through communication and perseverance that I was able to cum with my partner.

The only way to get past that is to work past that. The magic isn't found in any libido pills or potions, it's in working with your BF to stimulate you in a way that gets you off. It will take time and energy, but it's worth it. 

Start off by mimicking how you masturbate. Masturbate with him inside you. It will probably take you longer to cum than if you were by yourself, but it's a first step. Then work on baby steps that make him more of an active participant.

On the flip side, you need to start varying how you masturbate if you don't already. Fingers, humping, vibe, etc. Also vary the positions you masturbate in. Sitting, laying down, stomach, back, if your legs are usually straight, bend them, etc. 

You've worked yourself into an orgasm routine that your body follows and you need to switch that up and open up the possibility of cumming in different ways.",2015-08-05 09:16:23+00:00,cts4u7f,1.0,t3_3fu64q,17172.0,sex

1844,"I would absolutely get tested for everything. This is ultimately your decision, not your doctor's. 

From the [CDC's STD fact sheet](http://www.cdc.gov/std/hiv/stdfact-std-hiv.htm):

&gt; Why does having an STD put me more at risk for getting HIV?

&gt; If you get an STD you are more likely to get HIV than someone who is STD-free. This is because the same behaviors and circumstances that may put you at risk for getting an STD can also put you at greater risk for getting HIV. In addition, having a sore or break in the skin from an STD may allow HIV to more easily enter your body.

It's not like you're asking for these tests out of the blue. With the health risks associated with all of the other STDs, you have very good reason to want to be absolutely sure about your health. And not just for you, but for all of your past/future potential partners.

1922,"**TL;DR: If you don't want to go to the doctor because you don't want your parents to find out, there are ways around that. You really need to see a doctor.**

Hey OP, it sounds like ideally you'd want to go to the doctor, but you're hesitant because of having to tell your family why you want to go to the doctor or worried about what information your parents may learn from the doctor or insurance. If this is the case, there ways around that (see below). 

The bottom line, as the top comment says, is that you need to go to the doctor (or at least a clinic/nurse practitioner). Self diagnosing is a dangerous thing with these issues. And you definitely want to conclusively explain any penile anomalies to a partner, with evidence to back that up. Anything less is irresponsible and unfair to your partner.  

There are ways get to the doctor without your parents knowing why (or knowing at all).

* You're 17 so you should still be having annual physicals, which are covered by insurance. If you haven't has a comprehensive physical in a year, or this year, now is the perfect time. If your parents need a reason why, say that your knee, or joints, or abdomen, or something has been bothering you, or if you're in sports or another activity, say that it's recommended that you get one. Or say that they talked about it in school that you should get one done. It also normal for a wide variety of tests to be done, including STD screens, so it wouldn't be odd to see test information pop up on insurance, if it does at all. You can also place a call to the doctors office anonymously to inquire about what they can/do disclose to parents. I don't know if it's standard, but most doctors I'm aware of specifically request to see older adolescent patients alone for at least part of the visit, in order to speak freely/confidentially apart from parents.

* There are several walk in and community clinics that offer services on a sliding scale or free. These are more prevalent in and around larger cities, but they exist in some rural areas, too. Planned Parenthood is often the place that comes to mind, but there are others too. There are states where getting birth control and reproductive health services have gotten tougher, but STD screens are still plentiful and routine everywhere. 

* Some high schools and many colleges have health centers, and some of those can treat non-students. If they can't, they can certainly give you guidance about how to get checked out without your parents finding out. 

GO TO THE DOCTOR. Seriously. PM me if you need more help or info.

1941,"&gt; The main reason women fake it is because of the fear that their partner will be disappointed if they don't climax. Worst case scenario is if the partner reacts as you have.

Exactly this. I prefer not to fake. I think men underestimate how great sex can be even if women don't have an orgasm. Some men get it in their head that the only successful or acceptable sex ends in an orgasm, and they get a complex if it doesn't happen every single time. Or they just keep going forever in an attempt to get you there, when, for whatever random reason, an orgasm isn't going to happen and you just want them to stop before they fuck you raw. 

That's not fun to deal with.

As long as we go slow and gentle until I get him all the way in, I can take it as rough as he wants afterwards.

I really like laying flat on my stomach in the prone position (sometimes with a pillow underneath me) with him on top of during anal because when he thrusts it also grinds my clit into the bed/pillow. I also enjoy being on my back and playing with my clit or fingering/toying my gspot.

* [Here's a one page Vet Resource Guide](https://jobs.utah.gov/jobseeker/veterans/vetresourceguide.pdf) that has these and other numbers on it for your reference.

Alright, so this is probably a good starting point. I know that it can be even more difficult in your situation because being under stress and pressure and dealing with roadblocks and bureaucracy makes continuing to try and push to get help difficult - especially with mental health disorders. 

Keep pushing and you'll get this figured out. If you are having a tough time or if these resources don't pan out, message me and I'll see if I can do anything to help.

2130,"I just want to give you a hug and tell you ""it gets better"" but that sounds so cliche. 

I'll just say part of what contributes to the feeling that everything sucks is that you live with your parents and have little control over your life (at least that's how I felt sometimes when I was your age). But you're close to being old enough to be much more independent. 

Right now, most teens are limited to friends from school, which is usually has a population of fewer than a couple thousand people. I'm assuming you're in the same boat. When your pool of peers is all from the same place, with similar life experiences and there are so few of them, it can amplify the sense of not belonging and feeling like a square peg in a sea of round holes. 

Whether you go to college, or trade school, or out in the world to work, the exciting thing is that your pool of peers gets so much bigger. So instead of there only being a few (if any) people who understand you, you can find entire communities of people just like you. You'll be among people aren't so limited and uniform in their thinking (if you choose to be). You'll pick up more responsibilities as you get older and progress in your life, which can be very unfun, but having people who get you will usually make it easier. So I would definitely look forward to that.

As far as your parents are concerned, I don't know what the specifics of your situation are. But I do know that often times parents often massively freak out because you're getting closer to being an independent adult and moving out, and they are afraid they haven't prepared you well enough for it. So things get super serious and sometimes they become more harsh. Those actions are motivated by love and not wanted you to stumble or make some common mistakes, or mistakes that they made. It's really terrifying and hard for a parent to let go. Parents get very good at forgetting what it's like to be your age and on your side of things.

I also understand that the Miami heat sucks. They're also getting older and are less resilient than they used to be. Of course, that doesn't make things any easier for you do deal with. 

Maybe you could just talk to (or write) your dad and tell him that you don't feel like you have fun together anymore and you miss it. And that you just want to set aside like 30 minutes a day of some criticism-free time or have a movie night, or some time for things that you both enjoy. Sometimes parents get into such a routine of being tired or frazzled or stressed that they forget what it's like to be normal with their kids. Sometimes forcing a little normal time help them to remember, and can lead to them being normal more often.

Again, I don't know any details about your life or your situation, but your stress and frustration definitely comes through. 

When you need someone to talk to, /r/7cupsoftea can be really helpful (also check out the sidebar there for similar and related subs). I hope things get better for you soon.",2015-07-06 06:34:53+00:00,cstl300,2.0,t1_cstifq3,7222.0,AskReddit

2151,"Please don't listen to that other person. Having the desire to have that sexual experience doesn't make you ""gay."" People obsess too much over labels anyway. 

I know men who have had a curiosity or desire to mess with another man on a limited basis, but are always completely attracted to women sexually and romantically - before and after. The desire to do something with a male only comes up occasionally for them (usually only when they super extra horny) and they aren't romantically attracted to men at all.

They identify as straight, which makes sense. So even if you do consider messing with men, you're just like so many other straight guys who think about the same thing. 

People have no problem with applying this concept to women but get stupid when it comes to men.

People just don't talk about that as openly because of guys who can't wait to scream and pass judgment on people. And people like that are rarely logical and reasonable, and are often so aggressive because they're insecure or uncomfortable with their own desires.

2162,"I understand that you didn't have any ill intention and I take you at your word.

I hope you understand that just because reddit and the porny parts of the internet have more men than women, doesn't mean that women are rare. We're 1 out of 3 people here, not 1 out of 50. Many women lurk silenty and are less vocal than men, giving the illusion that they aren't there. 

A lot of that is because it gets tiring for women to justify that they're actually women, justify that they like porn, or field the incoming messages from men who automatically message any woman who comments in a NSFW context. One of those things happens most of the time. I used to lurk too, but a large part of the decision to do things (semi-)publicly is so we don't seem as rare.

Sometimes women just want to come and go (pun intended) without the extra hassle. I just ask that you consider doing a bit more homework with the information available to you before you introduce that hassle. If more people did that, you'd see more women in NSFW places.",2015-07-04 20:01:17+00:00,css7zlt,15.0,t1_css78pu,1583.0,gifs

There are a decent amount of girls in /r/GirlsHumpingThings specifically because it's an authentic experience that we don't see in many other places. Many are just not eager to comment publicly because their inboxes get bombarded. Girls enjoy porn a lot, and that's normal and fine.

/u/irregardless gave [a great explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3b98ds/eli5_when_the_us_government_says_you_cant_sell/cskcdco): 

The Supreme Court has ruled on multiple occasions that the duty of law enforcement is to the public or society at large, not to any given individual.

    Warren v. District of Columbia (1981) (4-3)
    DeShaney v. Winnebago County (1989) (6-3)
    Castle Rock v. Gonzales (2005) (7-2)

In the Warren case, the plaintiff sued the police for not providing adequate policing services. The court affirmed a lower circuit's decision that unless a special relationship with the citizen had been formed, the police were not duty-bound to provide a given service to an individual.

In DeShaney, the court held that inaction by the state (any given agent or agency) did not constitute a rights violation (unless  the state has custody of the individual).

In the Castle Rock case, the court ruled that a police department could not be sued for failing to enforce a restraining order, because (essentially) the order does not place an obligation on the police.

Bottom line: police can't be sued for ""not policing"".",2015-06-27 11:18:51+00:00,cskej10,3.0,t1_cskdeli,5521.0,explainlikeimfive

This is hilarious. I'm related to a blind musician and know others.

Do you know what low-vision and blind people do often, yet hate? Knock things over. 

So do you know what they end up doing? They become hyper-aware of the things that can get knocked over and hyper-vigilant for the situations that lead to knocking things over. They are much better at using their other senses, like placing people, objects, and activity by sound. They're also great at remembering layouts and where things are placed. 

All of those factors commonly lead to blind people often being better than sighted people at anticipating when something is going to be knocked over, and being able to more quickly recover when something is knocked over. Like a mic stand.

There's no pressure or expectations. If I do exactly as I'm told and take what he wants to give, I please the man most important to me, which pleases me. Simple and satisfying.

I'm also competitive. Sexually, that seems to translate into wanting to take more than he can give, and seeing how far I can push myself and how much I can take. That may sound unpleasant or like I'm doing it for him, but I get a lot of satisfaction from it. And I *really* get off on being able to please my partner in ways few others will, and to a degree that no one else will. 

Ironically, I also feel a sense of control through submission. It's a subversive control, but still control. 

It took me many years to figure this all out, and now I feel perfectly fine about it.

2261,"Sometimes ""support"" can be counterproductive.

A partner could have good intentions, but take actions that you're unprepared for or don't want. They could push hard to track down, confront, or report the people involved, and not everyone wants that. They may even do things against your wishes, or because they're so outraged, thinking they're doing what's right.

They may believe they're doing what's best and being supportive, but really doing things that make coping and life more difficult for the person who was violated. It can lead to feelings of re-victimization, betrayal and isolation.

I always think therapy is a good idea in situations like this, but there are a variety of justifiable reasons for not telling people who are close to you.

&gt; “BP’s conduct was reckless,” Barbier wrote in his decision handed down in New Orleans federal court on Sept. 4. “Transocean’s conduct was negligent. Halliburton’s conduct was negligent.” He said BP’s share of the blame was 67 percent, Transocean’s was 30 percent, and Halliburton’s fault was 3 percent.
