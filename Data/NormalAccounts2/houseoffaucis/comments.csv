107,"I HATED it but keep in mind I have stayed at higher end Disney hotels so I was comparing the AOA to these other hotels like The Beach Club. We had 2 adults/ 2 kids under 8 and 1 baby in our room. It was cramped, no room for luggage storage, the A/C was locked and it was not fun to have to walk outside to get to the lobby. The outside decor is amazing and the pool is great also. ",2015-10-02 15:44:30+00:00,cvlrp34,1.0,t3_3n632j,56172.0,WaltDisneyWorld
