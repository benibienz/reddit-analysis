1,"White guy here. I like black men. I have dated every race but for some reason I keep coming back to black men of all varieties.

I like some of the sub dom stuff; however, I like going back and forth  with the aggressive stuff like wrestling or light choking.

I really like bareback and breeding stuff. In practice I have to really, really know someone well to bareback with them. 

I don't talk about sex much but i find most of these things embarrassing to talk about. I didnt have my first kiss until I was 20 y/o. 

I'm starting to meet guys and date after a 3 year relationship so I'm pretty happy right now, I just dont know how to bring the subdom stuff up with people without my anxiety going crazy.",2016-11-20 14:55:38+00:00,da86s5j,1.0,t3_5dswie,84494.0,AskReddit

3,"Luckily diabetes type 2 is a reversible condition that can be treated with a healthy diet and exercise.

Do something everyday to work towards independence. Work out. Work on eating right. Work on developing good hygiene. Work on your resume. Work on getting a job. Work on hopefully getting a job with dental and health insurance. Dont take any of these with an ounce of judgement.

Get these goals organized. Being organized will take you far. I cant go to sleep if i havent jotted things I have on my mind down.

As for the dental stuff: Some universities with dental schools have really reduced dental options so try to find one of those. Theyll usually work out payment plans and stuff.

Work towards your independence sweetheart.

As for your how to make an argument, which was the actual title of this, I dont know what arguments your mom is making.

53,"Sort of off-topic but I don't answer these sort of story threads much so let me lay this one on you.

I was raiding Ulduar in WotLK and our guild was very sort of fun, not super duper into progression but it was entertaining. I was going through a shitty relationship at the time and so was the guild leader, so we had some meaningful late night conversations. Well school and work got in the way for me before the next raid was released so I put my WoW experience on hold.

Fast forward to a few years later when I join gay.com (don't judge me, I am gay and its not easy to find people to date). I literally message one guy and tell him hes cute. I give him my email and then get off the account because I was getting creeped out by some of the other members. I start talking with him and we talk about interests - turns out he had played wow too. On the same realm. After some figuring (I'm a horrible story teller), I end up finding out that he was my GM. 

He lives in Cali and I live in NC. We tried dating for a period and that didn't really work out because of the distance. I still like him and whatnot but we both have our lives. Still friends but I was flabbergasted because I never thought I'd find a love interest via WoW.

With a playerbase of 5 million or so (even atm) you'd think that there would be a dating site or something for WoW. I say this 10 months out of a 3 year relationship - haven't had a serious date yet... fellas.
