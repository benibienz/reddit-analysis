0,"First and foremost I would make CDR runes your next big purchase, they're one of the most commonly used runes especially among solo lanes..


But to answer your question, I really think it depends on a few key factors. What are you building on him? I know the Morello/Protobelt/Rabadons build is fairly popular right now, and that build gives you 30% CDR. Abyssal and Zhonya's Hourglass both give 10% and would round out your cap in that case. The problem is you want that CDR earlier in the game than as a 5th/6th item, and thats what CDR runes would solve. Getting boots of Lucidity is by no means a non-viable choice. Just look at probuilds.com, plenty of high elo players do it. It really comes down to personal preference and knowing which stat will give you the edge transitioning into mid and late game. Just try them both and see what you like :)",2016-06-27 15:23:46+00:00,d4pxbcq,2,t1_d4pwi1i,1168,summonerschool

2,"Hey! ADC main since season 3, currently gold 2 highest rank play 3. I climbed out of bronze after being there for two seasons when I started playing adc. I have found that champions that allow you to deal consistent damage without having to play around powerspikes work very well for lower Elo. I highly recommend Caitlyn, as well as Tristana.

7,"As an ADC main (ignore the Yasuo flair, I just love his lore), I actually welcome this ""tank meta"". I would MUCH rather kite a tank then get shit on by Fiora.

8,"This ones more complicated than most stacking passively... Basically, when you buy both items, only one effective is active AT A TIME. Sunfires damage procs immediately while cinder hulks builds up over time. This means that for the first few seconds, you'll be proccing the sun fire buff and then the cinder hulk will take over. That's why it feels like you're doing more damage, because you never have the ""low"" of cinder hulk prior to ramping up.

10,"The real problem isn't the summoner spells, its the fact that tanks are dishing out comparable damage to bruisers/carry top laners whilst taking negligible damage in comparison. There are several problems with top lane right now. 1) Tank Itemization is too cheap and too effective. It is simply too easy to get the items you need to cover all resistances and HP balance. 2) Itemization against tanks is far too difficult. BORK's nerf made it hard to deal with HP stacking effectively, and the selection of Armor Penetration items is lacklustser right now, leaving bruiser/carry type laners feeling very awkward to build against tanks. 3) Most of the carry laners that could deal with these ""super tanks"" have been nerfed too hard to deal with them now. (Which is a good thing, Fiora and GP in particular were WAY too strong.) 

For now tanks are simply going to roll over other matchups. Even Nasus is doing well into a good ammount of matchups right now which is just stupid. I feel your pain, but summoner spells probably won't fix the overall problem.",2016-04-12 11:52:20+00:00,d1zoajs,1,t3_4efowr,613,leagueoflegends

* Dragon is broken, its a free tower push.

However with double tp, its extremely hard to secure kills, and with shen and tf being seen more right now its just hell for bot lane. Every time I think I've secured a kill on someone in my lane, I see a tp. Every time I push in to apply pressure, I see a tp. Every time my jungler ganks and we attempt a free tower dive, I see a tp.

It seems I really only have success telling my adc to pick jinx or or trist and freeze the lane right outside our turret and pray our top/mid can do the same thing that the other top/mid do to us.

Its going to take a lot of playing no matter what, but questing is definitely your best bet past 50. As far as Priest is concerned, my Priest is 93 and I've loved leveling it, however once you get to 80, maybe 90, you start having trouble soloing stuff. For me that was fine because I play with my friend who plays dps classes, we just 2 manned with heal/dps, but if you're soloing then Priest is going to get really hard eventually. Definitely doable though!
