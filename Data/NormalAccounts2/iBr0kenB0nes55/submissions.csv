I can't even begin to explain how much I miss the feeling I used to get every day when I would get home from school and sit down to play League. I know from first hand experience that season1/2/3 (and honestly every season including this new one) have NEVER been balanced, and there are things that I am eternally grateful that riot removed or nerfed. (I shudder when I think about release Eve/Xinzhao week...). However, Gbay99 recently posted a video about why so many older players are quitting League, and to be quite frank, he really hit the point... Back in what I personally consider League's prime (Season 2/3), meta's were very focussed on lane matchups. The early game was nearly completely dependent on how you could outplay your opponent. There was a beautiful balance between solo play and team play, and the outcome of the game was much more dependent on how you performed against your opponent. I miss that meta! 

And there are so many other things that, while the new is undoubtedly better (in most cases), I still miss!!

* Old Items (Heart of Gold, Philo Stone, Leviathan, Ionic Spark, the beloved Force of Nature, and so many more...)

* Old Summoner's Rift (The new SR is absolutely amazing, and so much better to play on, but come on... what old player doesn't miss playing on the old SR from time to time??)

* Old ward ""limit"" (there was none!! Supports prepare to spend all your gold on Philo stone and wards!!)

Guys I know the game has come a long way for the better. I know that competitively the game has evolved into a massive scale templay oriented masterpiece, but I would love to have a couple of weeks to reminisce on the nostalgic League of Legends that initially drew me in. I personally think old players would all appreciate a game mode like this for that reason, and I even think new players would appreciate seeing what league was like back when it was just getting big. 

I could be alone in my opinion, and if I am, oh well... but I really think that something like this would be a really great thing for the community.

Because of this, you lose the game. The question is, do we rage? No. And let me explain why.

League of Legends is a team game; just like football, basketball, or American football. (you're welcome my EU friends). When you play a sport and someone gets hurt or has a bad game, how should you respond? You should respond by encouraging them, and playing your best and hardest even through the adversity. If you lose the game because your teammate does bad or gets injured (in league, DCs) its not going to help anything to flame them. Getting upset and whining and complaining about how you couldn't carry is the dumbest shit I've ever heard. You're playing a TEAM GAME. You WILL NOT be able to carry every single game. Even professional players can not carry every game they play. Inevitably, you will lose a game, whether it be your fault or a teammates. If you want to play a game where the outcome of each game is based solely of your skill, go play Ranked Starcraft, but stop bitching about your inability to carry bad teammates or DCs. I know it can be frustrating, especially when you do well. Trust me, I HATE losing games, especially when they were, at one point, very winnable. But its going to happen. So move on, and look forward to your next game. Focus on the mistakes YOU could have fixed, not anyone else, and play better next game.
