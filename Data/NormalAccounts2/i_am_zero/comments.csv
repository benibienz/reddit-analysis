11,"On mobile,please excuse bad formatting. 

Just boosted a fire mage last week and I've been doing dungeons and LFR and the DPS is abysmally low compared to anything else I've ever played. I've watched and read a ton of material on the spec and still am not putting out the damage of even fresh 100s. I've tried to self identify what's wrong with me, and came up with some questions. 

1.  Is Flame On superior to controlled burn for the larger bursts during combustion?

2.  Which level 100 talent is the best choice for raid content, assuming a single target encounter 

3.  When is the correct time to use RoP in your rotation? The entire talent feels clunky to me and I would much prefer not to use it but I've read it's a major  DPS loss. 

4. Am I correct in that when I get a heating up proc I then cast Fire Blast mid-fireball and then wait till the end of my current Fireball cast before spending the proc?

Thanks a bunch anyone that answers

27,Thanks for the detailed answer. You mentioned that you can make anyone viable if you play them enough and enjoy it. Is it safe to assume this game is like most fighting games where specializing in one character (or set of characters) to be really at them a good thing to do? Or should we play more than a few to have a wider range of options,2016-02-10 18:48:09+00:00,czv1m2z,3,t1_czv19yh,461,NarutoNinjaStorm

Are there characters that are literally bad to use?

What would a good character for spacing and playing a more ranged-focused game be?
