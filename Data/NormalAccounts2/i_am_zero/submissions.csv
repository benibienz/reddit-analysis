I havent played 3 in a couple years now, and I was wondering if there are any solutions to the crappy performance when using all the expansions?

My computer is pretty decent and should definitely be able to handle the game.

In doing so I thought why not and upgraded my case as well. I went from an NZXT Phantom 1 that included a stock 200mm and dual-120mm intake fans, paired with a 200m and 140mm exhaust. I never really monitored my temperatures before switching cases, which was a fatal flaw on my part.

My new case is the Enthoo Pro. I have the stock 200mm intake and 140mm exhaust. I have also added triple 120mm exhaust fans on the top, as well as another intake on the bottom of the case. 

I'm currently still using my stock Intel Heatsink on my i5 4670. Upon setting my rig back up, I monitored my temps while gaming. While playing something like Overwatch, my CPU temps get to around 75-80c. Or even playing the Witcher 3, they hover a little higher than that.

Complete dead idle, my rig runs around 30c, and with normal use like browsing and having a stream or two up it operates around 40-50c. 

My question would be, is 80c a normal operating temperature for my CPU while under heavy load such as the Witcher 3, Fallout 4, or other higher end games. And if it's not, should I spring for a better cooler? I was considering the Cooler Master 212 EVO.
