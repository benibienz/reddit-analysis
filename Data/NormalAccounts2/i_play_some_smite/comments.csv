18,"my father grew up with an abusive father, who he and my aunt pretty much hated. his father and grandfather smoked. their side of the family owned a paint shop. my father got a bachelor's in argriculture at virginia tech, and moved to the country in virginia where he had me. his sister married, had a son, got a divorce, and remarried to a fellow smoker. she's since quit, but he hasn't. she's a vet.

my mother's father died when she graduated highschool. she inherited his paint shop (yes that side of the family also owned one) but she didn't know how to run it and it closed down. she flunked her first year of college (well my grandma pulled her out because she partied too much), and married my dad and moved to the country with him. her brother moved away and she and my grandma are pretty much the only people who know where he lives. i think he's a chef or something.

pay their employees more. as a lanky teenager, im sure im coming off as a ""aww my life is so difficult,"" and i know its not, but i know its not just me or my coworkers that think this job's pay isnt at all justified. i risk my life everyday and sweat all the time in incredible conditions to make like 3 or 4 pizzas a minute, wash maybe over 100 dishes in a little over an hour, and stay there past 12 am on the worst nights. (my latest ive ever been there was 3 am). i only make 7.25 an hour though.

however, im not even the one they should be raising the pay of. i was told once im 18 they'll make me a manager because they like my work ethic, but my pay will only be 9 dollars an hour. even worse is that general managers make between 20k-30k a year, (i think) and have to work about 50 hours a week with no paid overtime. my boss ends up working like 60 - 65 hours a week however cause he doesnt want to leave until the store is in proper conditions for him to leave.",2016-08-08 05:00:30+00:00,d68o9lb,4.0,t1_d68o2jn,425.0,casualiama
60,"Little Caesars is a pizza joint established in the year 19XX. One husband and wife decided to make food and also have a twist, so they made a buy 1 get 1 free deal with every pizza. Some time ago that was abolished and they just had overpriced garbage pizza, but one day, after they realized they sucked, corporate decided to make it a pizza fast food restaurant.

 That means 1) the food is inexpensive and 2) its ready when you get there. Youre probably thinking our quality sucks if thats the case, but honestly i dont think so. It really depends on who's making it, and if we know X sucks at making pizzas were gonna have Y make them because shes so much better. You come in, and if you order just a regular pepperoni or cheese it will be 5 dollars and should be available instantly.

Sadly, we have to make sure stuff doesnt go bad. our computer makes it impossible to sell a pizza thats 30 minutes old, so we don't keep too much ready at once. Thus, if someone comes in and orders 6 pizzas, the next person will have to wait cause they just took all of our ready stuff.

2) I'm not even sure what hacking means, but I'm pretty sure that's not what I did. Hacking is what the computer whizzes do with viruses or whatever is even done. I'm just typing in a password so I can use youtube.

I don't really care if you reconsider my post, cause I don't think anyone else will be reading it at this point, but future posters will probably get upset that you're removing their posts without valid reasons.
