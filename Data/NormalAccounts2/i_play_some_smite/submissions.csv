Hiveswap has released, and Homestuck's sequel, and/or another adventure is posted by Andrew Hussie. Fans of Homestuck are still here, and while they still remember Homestuck, they hype over the new game and the new webcomic way more. The actual Homestuck posts are dwindling. People who are trying to find the sub for this kind of stuff don't know where to look, until trial and error leads them to /r/homestuck. I sense our situation isn't too practical for the future.

So, when Hussie's next wacky adventure unfolds, or when Hiveswap releases, do we make a new subreddit? Or do we keep it on this subreddit? I've never tried seeing if one already exists, but perhaps a sub for the mspa website could be a thing isntead? I (and I imagine many others) don't mind our current sub, cause it makes sense for homestuck, but it doesn't seem practical (to me at least) if we were to keep the homestuck sub for future adventures.

From reading this, I've deduced a few things. Caliborn is probably always yelling, but I like to imagine him out of breath. Karkat's always yelling because he's always angry, but Caliborn is always yelling because he has a god complex and wants to be over everyone, so he's always out of breath by asserting his dominance. Maybe his voice is a bit sore.

Caliborn is also really stupid, but tries to act smart. If you read this whole bit, Caliborn has a very unique vocabulary, but he also ends his sentences prematurely. In my opinion, he just says what he can in a single gust of breath, and so he thinks that is a sentence. As shown here, he even began a sentence with ""me thinks,"" http://www.mspaintadventures.com/ACT6ACT6.php?s=6&amp;p=008777, so I'm thinking he's slowly inventing his own form of English since he rarely communicates with people at this point in the game. Additionally, he keeps using Japanese words throughout this whole bit, so I'd like to think he's butchering the pronunciation heavily. Tsundere, on the page with Dave and Karkat, I thought he may pronounce two-sun-dairy.

I heard that Caliborn is supposed to be reminiscent of the Jigsaw guy from the saw movies, right? I've never seen those, so I have no idea who that character even is, but perhaps his voice could be similar to Jigsaw's? I think Jigsaw's voice comes as very unsettling and maybe kind of like that voice where there's a creepy guy on the phone who calls at 1 am and then cuts your line before murdering you.

Are there any other options, or should I just go with what I think is best and hope he lives?


**WALL OF TEXT ABOUT TEENAGERS AND SUICIDE.** You don't gotta read it but I would appreciate it, if that makes a difference.


My buddy I know online is suicidal, and I'm the only one he's told. He found the materials for his noose today and plans on killing himself in about 70 days. Why 70, I have no clue, but it's irrelevant. He'll be turning 18 in about 60 days, but according to him it's not involving his birthday.

I have tried to convince him, talk him out of it, let him realize his potential and the future, but he does not want to listen to me. Several issues have appeared in his head. He dislikes his family and everyone he knows, he claims to be untalented (which he's not. he could easily hold a position at a networking job at this age), and even if his life turned uphill he said he'd still kill himself anyways because he's too emotional of a person.

I'm 16 and this is some brutal stuff to take in. Despite what my account history says, I am not a new reddit user, this will be my 4th year on the site. I'd like to think I am well acquainted with serious topics like this, but I'm having difficulty thinking of a positive outcome with this one.

I really do not want him to commit suicide, no one should ever have to try or even think that, and I want to do my best to protect him. He does not want my help, however. He doesn't actually like me, but that's ok. He told me he just uses me to tell someone his plans so he can figure it out. There are two people he feels emotionally connected with, supposedly, his best friend and a girl I introduced to him a few years ago whom he doesn't talk to anymore. I have contact with both of them.

I asked if he wanted to talk to them, but he told me if I told them I'd literally be the worst person on the Earth to him. (He went into much greater detail but no need for that). He does not want to upset them before he dies, he wants them to remain happy. Even after he dies, he doesn't want me to tell them. It's best they find out on their own or not at all he told me.

Obviously, there are two things here I'm thinking about: 1) I really don't want to talk to him anymore, considering this is not the first time he's been a massive jerk to me. I can make a long list about reasons he and I don't have good charisma, but his life is more important than my attitude. 2) I don't want him to die. I want him to be happy.

So, how can I save his life? He doesn't care what I have to say about it, I've already tried and asked. My only hope is to tell those two people, my friend and his, about his upcoming suicide, and hope for the best. I also don't want to do that for that would make him really sad, for it's exactly what he told me not to do. I could care less if he hated me from doing that, I just want him to live. I just can't decide if that's a good idea. I was thinking about trying to convince him to live another year (For I'll be 18 then) and maybe I could come pick him up and he could live with me, but he doesn't want to do that, he wants to live near or with his buddy. 

I ask your help /r/Christianity. I am no longer of use to him, but I still want him to live. What is the best way I can do that? Should I listen to what he told me and not tell his friends and hope he doesn't have the courage or finally listens to me? Should I tell his two ""mates"" and hope that he and they can figure out a solution since he cares about them, even though he's told me that if I tell them it would just prompt his suicide even more?

If I do the latter option, I don't want to ever talk to him ever again. I might send him a message saying, ""Hey X, I've deduced I really don't want to speak to you anymore, but I still care about your life. I've gone ahead and told Y and Z about your problem. I don't care if you hate me, I want you to live. And if they can't convince you, I will miss you, even if you could care less about me or them."" To which I'll block him.

I don't really ask, ""How can I convince him not to kill himself?"" It's clear I cannot do that. I've introduced several reasons as to why he's a worthwhile citizen but he doesn't listen. This is more of a, ""What method will make sure he lives?""

Thank you for your help /r/christianity. I love you all.",Christianity,What should I do here? WALL OF TEXT,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/40l583/what_should_i_do_here_wall_of_text/

I don't wanna call myself depressed, this is something I'll get over in a few days, but I do know I need a new friend in my life.

I really like to talk about a lot of things. I love to speak, and I'll speak about anything you want to. Communication is a beautiful thing, and I'm thankful I get to share it with any of you. I love to laugh, I love to be serious, I love to have casual conversation. If something is really putting you down, I'd like to think I can talk about it. If you want to laugh, I hope I can do that. If you feel like having a debate I can talk about that. 

I'm a huge nerd, (as most redditors are) so I really like to go depth about minor stuff. I play three games (mainly), Team Fortress 2, Smite, and 2007Runescape. The technicalities of those games is something I love to talk about, and I can talk about any small detail. I plan out what I want to do in those games weeks ahead, and set goals to meet them.

I really like talking about education and learning. Knowledge is a very underrated thing in my opinion and I love to embrace that. I'm currently in highschool and could tell you anything and everything about what I'm learning, and I'll love to listen to what you want to tell me about yours. 

If you want to talk about politics, social issues, religion, I'd love to do it. Those topics interest me so much. My only problem is that I'll never be able to study all of them. I feel blessed to be born into this stage of Earth where all those things are extremely prevalent. Every action I see on the news, read on Reddit, hear from people because I love to talk and listen; it goes into my head. I don't feel like my opinions are part of me, so I'm happy to drop them. I try not to judge people or be judged. I want to live and love with everyone.

Whatever you want to talk about, I'll listen. If you want to hear about anything I have to say, I'll happily talk to you. I do try to keep my responsibilities above most anything, so I won't always have time to talk. I hope you understand. (In fact I should be showering right now). Please comment or message if you want an Internet social butterfly. I guess one last note is that I am fairly similar in the real world, but only when people make the first approach. It's much easier to gain trust online when everyone is anonymous.
