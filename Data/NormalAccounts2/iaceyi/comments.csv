222,"Nice write up!

When I was looking at this game, I know UCF had been rebuilding.  Being a UConn Fan, I saw them struggle in the AAC last year both times we played, as well as into the tourney.  

Surley they are better this fall.  Daiquan Walker I looked at being the x-factor in this game.  He got in a lot of games last year, and slowly improved his PPG.  As a Senior now, I feel like he's going to fit that mold of a strong guard player and hopefully will reduce the amount of turnovers UCF had in the past.  


Also am keen on seeing how Tacko Fall will do after his whole eligibility crisis.  Adding such a tall player can obviously switch the mindset of the team, but I'm sure he won't be getting that many minutes tonight.

Davidson on the other hand had a great year last year.  Coming into the A-10 and being that dominant showed they wanted a foothold in the league right away.  Although they are a strong offensive unit, when I was looking at the +16 I just felt that even if UCF starting giving the game away, it was enough for them to bounce back and backdoor cover if necessary.  Take for example the Pacific Arizona game last night.  Arizona was getting up 25-27 points on Pacific who was +22.  In the last couple a minute garbage points saw Pacific cut back into the spread and cover.  That's what I think might happen here.  Hope I didn't drag this on too long, and cheers!",2015-11-14 16:49:57+00:00,cx00y3j,3,t1_cx00ktf,765,sportsbook
