Two weeks ago Reddit would upvote this shit like it was goddamn gold.

I never thought the joke was funny in the first place, but don't act like this joke went from popular to unpopular over a long period of time and this person is just beating a long dead horse. You motherfuckers think you're classy or something when all you've done is followed an Orwellian groupthink hive mind circle jerk that states you will now downvote anyone who dares to make this comment. And because you fucks switched so fast on what's funny and what's not, people who aren't caught with the latest fucking Reddit trend will comment and be confused as shit.
Fuck you. Fuck you, and fuck this entire website. You aren't leaders in Reddit comedy, you don't have any sort of higher authority on what's funny and what's not, you're all just a bunch of fucking followers who change opinions as often as r/me_irl changes to new memes, switching from trend to trend of popularity like elementary school kids on a playground. Don't clame to be the ones with the ""more mature"" sense of humor in this situation, because you're acting like children.
God, fuck you fucking fuckers. Fuck you hard. Pieces of arrogant shit.

**The Human Rights Campaign's summary of Donald Trump's stances on Marriage Equality, Discrimination, and Transgender Equality:**

&gt;Marriage: Trump has been a consistent opponent of marriage equality. He said that he opposed it because he was a “traditional” guy, choosing to support domestic partnership benefits instead. Trump later reversed himself and said he also opposed civil unions. Despite a brief flirtation with “evolving” in 2013, Trump has consistently maintained his opposition to marriage equality, sometimes by citing polling and making an analogy to his dislike of long golf putters. After the Supreme Court ruling, Trump said the court had made its decision and, although he disagreed with the ruling, he did not support a constitutional amendment that would allow states to re-ban marriage equality. He later said he would appoint Supreme Court judges who would be committed to overturning the ruling.

&gt;Discrimination: While Trump at one time said that federal law should protect people from discrimination based on sexual orientation, he has taken aggressively anti-equality positions as a formal candidate. Trump has expressed support for the so-called First Amendment Defense Act (FADA) which would lead to more Kim Davis-style discrimination. He has declined to support the Equality Act.

&gt;Transgender Equality: Trump has expressed support for North Carolina’s HB2, he’s said he would rescind the Obama Administration’s guidance that transgender students be treated wtih dignity and allowed to use restrooms that match their gender identity, and when it comes to governors like Pat McCrory that write discrimination into state law, Trump has made it clear he would not enforce federal civil rights laws ensure transgender Americans are treated equally under the law.

If that was true, that could be devastating. But if you look at the top left of the tweet, you can see something interesting. The poll was by Rasmussen Reports. Now this website has done some interesting stuff. Back in the 2012 election, they said that ""Romney Beats Obama, Handily"". They also said that ""Romney 315, Obama 223"". Let's check out the final results. Obama got 332 and Romney only got 206. So you can see how this poll doesn't seem entirely correct.

Overall, Rasmussen Reports is bullshit, [he isn't even close](https://i.imgur.com/edxUPhp.png).
