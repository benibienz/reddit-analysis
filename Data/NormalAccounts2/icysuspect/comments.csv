1,"Well, shoot. That's a loaded question. I could get as meticulously detailed as you want, but I'll start as general/broad as possible since that is a general/broad question.

First, time and hours played. There is no substitution for experience.

Don't touch the ground, even when you are spamming a choke on flat ground. Even the slightest angle makes it much easier to hit. In general, rooftops and high ground are your friends.

Direct hits are where Pharah becomes powerful. Direct hits are easier the closer you are to your enemy. If a Pharah is landing all her shots she is as formidable a foe as any in the game, at least on console. This take practice in real game situations to achieve high skill.

Justice rains from two feet away. Her ult is actually really good, but the difference between certain death and a sweet triple usually comes down to proximity and stealth.

Zarya is your best friend. Graviton Surge and Barrage are probably the best wombo in the game. You cut right through support ults, and kill everything in that thing in half a second. Communicate with your Zarya, position yourself so you can drop right behind the Rein, and hide! Proceed when you hear Fire at Will. Ask for a barrier.

Concussive blast is an integral part of her kit. The difference between a good and a great Pharah is this tool. It can be used to initiate a duel vs. a counter to give you an advantage by throwing off their aim and giving you a free shot, it can be used to shoot yourself out of a proverbial cannon and assault an enemy head on at high velocity unexpectedly, it can be used like a a short range blink to reposition, it can be used as an escape, it can boop people off maps, it can boop people off high ground, it can save someone from a Roadhog, save an allied Mei from certain death after ice block, boop an enemy into an ult, boop an ulting enemy away... It's such a powerful ability.

Being directly above an enemy at a sort of close-medium range is the preferred fight. It is absurdly hard to aim at an enemy who is right above you and constantly hovering towards your flank. And at a certain sweet spot of range, Pharah is absolutely miserable to play against.

Don't be afraid to Junkrat from a mile away. Sometimes, throwing missiles at Rein shields and groups of enemies at chokes is all you need. It's also great for building ult.

Do be confident and engage at close range when appropriate. Pharah has a pretty low TTK on 200 HP enemies and can assassinate like a pro. Don't be scared to get in the trenches when your team has pushed up and has the enemys' attention. I make heavy use of a tactic my friend calls barrel-stuffing. Meaning, stuffing my barrel in their face and blowing them up.

You will have counters. They need to die first before you can go all out and assault the enemy head on. Get the jump on them (flank, stealth, concussive blast, lack of attention), or avoid the until they have to deal with you and your team too. When you spam, focus them. You have to play defensive and Junkrat sometimes. Multiple counters demand more conservative and calculated approaches. Don't be an easy pick, but don't be intimidated -- always play with a killer instinct. Just get the jump on them, get in their face, and eliminate them quick. It is plenty possible to go up against multiple counters, but you have to be aware of them at all times. The good thing is, a good Pharah DEMANDS strong counterplay, because if she isn't countered she will lead her team to victory. When that happens, you become the focus of the other team. You soak up the discords, the choke spam, the focus, change the entire team comp, everything. If you play it right, you can still stay alive and deal decent DPS while your team punishes the other team for overplaying you so hard. If you have to engage in a straight up duel, initiate with a 'juggle', meaning concussive blast them into the nearest wall and take a shot. It's the only free shot you'll get.

That is the main tips, off my head. It's important to learn how to 1v1 every enemy and pick them off with direct hits. Every enemy has a range, every enemy has a weakness to exploit. Except Roadhog. 76 and McCree and Widow and Hanzo and all those guys can be dueled 1v1 against effectively, except Roadhog. There is no fucking with Roadhog. You will almost certainly need help, lest you avoid at least two hooks (takes like eleven seconds to kill him, assuming you land all directs and don't get murdered by alt-fire or other enemies). If you have to fight Hog, make heavy use of the new patch and fight him from a distant planet.

Healers are your friends. Pharah can protect them and stave off flankers, and to be effective, you'll need them because Pharah usually soaks up poke damage pretty hard.

Also, you are going to want to play with a Tracer or Genji on attack, most of the time, unless you have a dive comp or good communication. Pharah is a beast at getting enemies low and being a general purpose damage dealing machine, but she isn't always capable of finishing them off. Tracer and Genji excel at just that. 

If you get good enough to start getting pocket Mercies, play as aggressive you can, but make sure you keep her in places where she won't get shot down just like you would if you didn't have her, because once the enemy sees Pharmercy, Mercy becomes the focus.

I guess that's it.

e: Embrace dogfighting with another Pharah, and get good at it. Pharah is a really strong and unique counter to Pharah. Most Pharahs are one-trick ponies and either never change direction or change direction all the time. Avoid fighting from below at every cost, and try to engage the other Pharah whenever possible.

e2: Fuck with Reinhardt, a lot. Boop him all over the place, take down his shield, hit him from above and behind, etc. Rein can't do anything against Pharah, and since he is present in like 90% of games you can really make his life difficult. And he is a priority target because once he goes down the enemy is much more vulnerable.",2016-11-19 00:06:14+00:00,da6dln0,2.0,t1_da66yc1,9708.0,Overwatch

16,"1. Agreed. This does not pertain to only Sharpshooters.

2. Realistic. If you switch on a screen, you are at risk for getting beat, and if you do so with a 7'3"" 340lbs C, then you should be prepared to watch his 30 lateral quickness be abused.

3. Then you had better nerf HoF Pick and Roll Maestro, which is allowing Playmakers to shoot 3s off screens at an extremely high percentage (like a SS but with less range). While we're at it, let's keep HoF Relentless Finisher broken so Slashers can't make contact layups with consistency. I can only imagine OP's rage when Slashers aren't trash. We should probably address HoF Drop Stepper and Post Spin Technician, since those make a Post Scorer entirely unguardable.

4. I'm a 6'5"" Sharpshooter PG with minimum weight/maxed playmaking, and I have 77 ball control, and 74 speed with ball. Let's compare this with Curry who has 98 ball control and 94 speed with ball. 33 year old Ray Allen has 79 ball control and 77 speed with ball. Mission (already) accomplished.

5. See #4. The only types of people I blow past with my slow ass PG is people who suck at defense or 7'3"" Centers trying to switch on to me. That is a textbook mismatch and should be exploitable. Against any decent opponent, I basically never ever ISO because I am not getting past my man and finishing with consistency. This is a non-issue unless you suck. That is your problem. Now tell me this: Why do I see Playmakers drill 75% of their open 3s like they were a SS? Why do I see Slashers and Glass Cleaners with a 60 3pt rating hit from the corner with consistency? 

6. We are. We have a badge called Catch &amp; Shoot that greatly increases our ability to make open spot up 3s, the moment I take one dribble, even if I don't move, I lose this extremely powerful bonus. The fact of the matter is you aren't going to get a ton of wide open catch and shoot opportunities against a good team. Sharpshooters need to maintain their lethality off the bounce or they would be much less viable. Guys like Redick, Allen and Korver take plenty of 3's off the bounce. I modeled my Sharpshooter after JJ Redick, I watch the guy in real life all the time.

7. This might be the most laughable part of this ragepost. If my guy COULD finish relatively efficiently at the rim, I would be so much more dangerous. Sharpshooters have &lt;70 layups and dunking ability (unless you are giant SB, even then you are low 70's standing which is realistic). Sharpshooters can't finish in traffic to save their life. If you are complaining that we can finish wide open layups and dunks, then lol.

8. If a Glass Cleaner is boxed out, it's done. It's over. You're not going to grab a rebound going over another bigman's back. That's a foul. Where Glass Cleaners are so good at is grabbing contested rebounds and 50/50 balls. They already do that great. If you made your dude 7'3"" 340lbs and are too slow to win boxout battles, that's your fault for following cookie-cutter builds on YouTube from people that have little knowledge of the game. There is a reason why some of the best rebounders in NBA history are kinda short (Russell, Rodman, Barkley are all under 6'9""), that's because they are far from slow and boxout opponents at ease. And if you made your GC with minimum wingspan, then you have made a grave mistake and need to remake your guy.

9. I can agree with that one. Again, this does not pertain to only Sharpshooters.

10. Mid 70's lateral quickness is plenty for defending a Sharpshooter, although my friends and I have always thought giving EVERYONE extremely average defense was a little strange. I always though that LDDs should have the same offense as playmakers, but with garbage playmaking (and no off. badges), and they should maintain higher lateral quickness at larger heights (a min. weight 6'8"" LDD has 83 lat. qui., that's too low for a guy who sacrifices everything for defense).

All in all, #1, #9 (and to some extent #10, though that is sort of unrelated) are valid points, IMO. And 2K has already said they are addressing those two points. If you had your way and got each and every point tuned to your liking, I'm making a Playmaker ASAP because that would break the SS archetype and my little 6'5"" PG beyond competitive usability.

19,"No, this is not an example of crappy programming. Ankle Breakers are what's known in many other gaming communities as a proc (Programmed Random OCcurence). With HoF Ankle Breaker and and his grand badge activated, his percentage to break the ankles of the defender actively guarding him is increased. When he hit them with that move, the Ankle Breaker proc'd on both of them simultaneously, which is pretty rare, thus this post.

To actually program Ankle Breakers to be an event that happens based off a perfect move and poor reaction of the defender would be extremely difficult and cumbersome to program, and even harder to balance properly. So the devs made the correct and time-sensitive decision to turn it into a proc whose likehilood of happening is boosted most heavily by being the only Archetype whose focus is on elite ball handling, which is sensible.

While 2K is nowhere near perfect, I don't see much problem in this. Less dramatic Ankle Breakers happen most of the time, so the fact that he got both of them in a dramatic fashion is pretty cool. ",2016-10-31 22:27:20+00:00,d9g16vq,3.0,t1_d9fy6vb,3823.0,NBA2k

22,"I'm a 6'5"" Sharpshooter PG specializing in chucking lots of 3s off spot ups, the occasional stop and pop, and screens from amethyst brick wall. I shoot 70% from downtown (often from limitless range) on high volume. I can't finish at the rim in traffic to save my life (so I never even try), and my ability to create shots in ISO is extremely limited, so I tend to defer to a more capable teammate, or ask/wait for a screen or two to come my way.

On the 3s I really let loose. Pretty much fire at will on any decent look. I am borderline 'that guy', but I have developed a very keen sense of the fine line between well-contested and deadeye greenlight, and thus very rarely (if ever) shoot my team out of games (and many times I have carried the scoring load, with the help of my teams' screens and passes).  There are times where I will defer entirely depending on the situation, and I make good, dynamic reads off picks.

On 2s I am very judicious with my 3s and tend to stick to midrange off the bounce to maximize my FG%. I abuse screens to the maximum with the ball, and space the floor with a corner spot up when my buddy has it.

Defensively, I do a solid job but I don't get a whole lot of steals, blocks, or boards. Mainly just stay in front of my matchup, switch on screens, and close out hard on every shot, then leak out for a fastbreak or outlet pass.

I am basically the 2K incarnation of a very aggressive J.J. Redick, who was my original inspiration for my guy. I move around as much as I can (without impeding spacing), and I love my big guys who set me screens and get me buckets and assists. I never, ever play with randoms because MyPark is a cesspool of shitty teammates with low BBIQ. I don't set screens often and don't really average good teammate grades (C+/B-).

25,"Counter point, they are an order of magnitude slower and can not get open easily.

There isn't too much evidence of being taller making you much better, anyways. I'm a 65 sharpshooter on one of the best pro am teams in the world and I shoot a better percentage than 98% of my opponents and all of the stretch bigs on our team (we have two 73s and they struggle to get involved scoring-wise when they face an opponent with a brain who does not leave them open).

Making a 7 foot+ Stretch Big doesn't mean you hit contested threes with any consistency. I play a lot of Ante Up (and Pro Am, MyTeam and MyLeague) and I can tell you with certainty that properly contested jumpers (full shot contest meter) aren't going to fall no matter how big you are. Thus, extra speed, ball handling, and quickness are more important, since they earn you more open jumpers, which fall at an extremely high rate and are the types of shots you should design your build around and try to earn in a game.

I honestly believe the 73 build is the most overrated shit on the game. People on here complain about them so much when in reality they are simply leaving them open, contesting too late, then complaining that a guy with purple deadeye getting hit by a purple dimer made it. The reality is a super tall guy is useless beyond hitting open spot ups because of dumb defenders and blocking shots or getting rebounds on the occasion they are already in position to do so.

Besides, a 69 guy is pretty tall anyways, taller than any guard you might get contested by, so both points are somewhat moot.",2016-10-31 01:07:18+00:00,d9eq1ei,5.0,t1_d9ecr12,17682.0,NBA2k

Dude is absolute garbage on defense. Every time I see someone with him in their lineup I run pick and roll to start almost every play. Why? He can't switch or hedge to save his life. You have to hope you can fight through pick or else it's an easy bucket.

Dude can't get back on D to save his life. Every fastbreak or every time he scores I hit the trailing center for an easy dunk.

Offensively he is useful for throwing up dumb shit around the rim or stand dunking from 8 feet away. If you want 7'7"" cheese, get Muresan. At least he has post game and 95 strength you can abuse.",2016-10-22 07:25:25+00:00,d92tkpz,2.0,t1_d92pg8a,11060.0,NBA2k

40,"Well, first of all, you have three people in that starting lineup that can't shoot. If I played against you, you'd be an easy win because all I would do is tell my entire frontcourt to gap off those guys hard and bring lots of help, which would make winning against your starters very easy, especially with such a poor defensive backcourt. You should never, ever have less than 3 people who can hit open 3s at a high clip, and ideally, you should have 4 for spacing purposes.

Second of all, I'd scrap LeBron. The attribute nerfs they gave current players this year hit LBJ *really* hard. He can't shoot at all, is a poor ball handler, a surprisingly average finisher and is generally a big offensive minus across the board. 

Honestly, I'd go with Marion so you can slot him at the 4. Oakley is trash... Relatively unathletic, awful lateral quickness, terrible inside scoring, a fugly inconsistent jumper and has an extremely inflated overall for what he really plays like. Drop him too. Marion is absolutely perfect for your team. Gives you reliable outside shooting and great slashing, much needed defense and athleticism and would instantly be the most versatile game changer your team could upgrade to. He is more or less an ideal stretch 4, because he can rebound his ass off too and even post up smaller players. And by putting him at the 4, you are free to experiment with all the SFs you might want instead of bootleg LeBrick.

Another thing I'd do is grab a Klay Thompson and slot him at the two over Peja. Peja isn't too bad (very wet), but Klay is more or less his peer in shooting and has much better defense across the board. And most important, he is a Dynamic Duo with Curry, which amps the shit out of both of them and makes them a lot better.

And yeah, I'd definitely get rid of Calderon. There are tons of options that are much better. Rewards emerald Jay Williams is one of them... decent defender, strong finisher (dunks like John Wall) and has pretty reliable 3 when he's open. Even if you don't like him, there's plenty of solid PGs you could upgrade to that can shoot well and still have some semblance of athleticism and defense.

Lastly, some advice from a guy who is 120-9 and is in 2nd prestige Pink Diamond league, is that the color and name of the card doesn't matter a whole lot. There are some emeralds that perform better than rubies (like Klay, JRich, Bogut), and some rubies that are worse than golds (Oakley, Bogues). Doing your due diligence and scouting out attributes, tendencies, and animations of prospective players is important if you want to have success. And for the love of all that is Holy, please don't underestimate the importance of defense, shooting and athleticism. Any card that ticks all three of those boxes is off to a very good start.",2016-10-22 00:13:52+00:00,d92hl0m,1.0,t3_58q587,5256.0,NBA2k

44,"Besides Relentless Finisher when it gets fixed (which will be a very nice addition), Catch and Shoot will really help on spot up 3s, together with a gilded Corner Specialist, he should drop most looks from the corner. Tear Dropper triggers on several layups that aren't necessarily floaters, and if you take floaters, then it is a great badge to have. One Man Fastbreak is always awesome, should help amp that 88 spd/bll up and let him get to the rim quicker. Lob City Finisher is a decent option if you slot him at the 2 or 3 where he will be in position to catch them on occasion.

I'd also consider ball-handling badges, like Pick and Roll Maestro and Dimer, if you plan on running your offense theough him.

Post Spin Technician isn't bad either, since Thompson has unusually high strength and post control for a 2 guard. Could help generate a couple easy buckets per game.

And since Skywalker is a two-way player, I'd definitely think about adding Defensive Stopper and Pick Dodger. He's a good shot blocker, but his height and position makes them happen pretty rarely. I wouldn't add Rim Protector or Chasedown Artist before any of the badges above, but that's just me.

Edit: If he's like he was last year, his somewhat poor and generic dribbling animations, along with only 80 ball control, means that Ankle Breaker is probably not the best badge you could add. Even on elite handlers, Ankle Breaker is only moderately effective anyways... certainly not worth it on a mediocre ball handler.",2016-10-18 20:55:48+00:00,d8xsktc,1.0,t3_5826zw,55663.0,NBA2k
45,"&gt;Relentless finisher only helps with stamina.

This is incorrect. Relentless Finisher, when working correctly, is supposed to greatly lessen the effect of layup fatigue, a mechanic in which a player gradually loses effectiveness on successive contact layup attempts. On frequent slashers like David Thompson, it's a must have (when it isn't horribly broken, it has the complete opposite effect right now). It does help with Stamina as well, which is a nice plus because of how much quicker it drains this year.

I'd advise any Diamond Skywalker owners (and any other frequent slashers without it) to save a spot for Relentless Finisher when it gets fixed, but to hold off for now.",2016-10-18 20:40:19+00:00,d8xrqsu,2.0,t1_d8x0tzj,36874.0,NBA2k

50,"Depends. I'd say Francis for most people.

Marion is the best player overall but you need more imagination to use him effectively on offense since he can't beat his man with raw speed or handles like Francis, need to use the post, cuts, screens and fast breaks to get him buckets. Nothing beats gis versatility as a defender and rebounder.

Franics is probably one of the premier offensive cards in the game, could even be the best. Stupid fast, good handles, reliable jumper and amazing finishing ability. You can  really build a team around him, and let him dictate the offense. He's a serviceable defender.

I'd say, for you, go Francis. He can really be the go to guy for your team and he doesn't need to be setup. Just make sure to grab a really good perimeter defender to deal with cheesy opponents.

UNLESS you really like Jay Williams and don't care for Francis' elite ability to finish in traffic (which is the main upgrade you'd get), or don't tend to rely on an elite scorer to get your offense going.

6'11"" because that is the tallest you can get and maintain a 94 steal rating.

Maximum wingspan because wingspan is extremely important for defense and rebounds.

Minimum weight so you can use your speed and quickness to box out glass cleaners, and for 71 lateral quickness/speed for switching on picks.

I'd pass on building for tons of strength. Your speed and quickness advantage when boxing out will be the deciding factor, not some extra strength.

Second, if you don't have the shooting badges, it is literally 4x as hard to hit 3s. Every SS archetype badge besides mid range deadeye will help you a whole hell of a lot. With HoF badges, the game is much, much more forgiving with the shots it allows to drop.

Third, you ought to just grind your career on Rookie difficulty until you can cap your 3pt rating, get all the HoF badges, and in doing so fix your hot zones. Look up the different badge tutorials on YouTube and ask out at half to maximize your VC/hour and attribute upgrade gain. It is relatively boring and entirely unrealistic... thankfully as Sharpshooters it only takes us a third of a single season to finish the grind if you are smart about it.

Fourth, find a jumper that is both easy for you to time, but that is also hard for the defense to contest. I recommend starting out trying some of the more popular jumpers, like LaMarcus Aldridge, Tony Parker, Rudy Gay, Damain Lillard and John Wall, to start you off in the right direction. A good jumper makes a big impact, not only for your timing/comfort, but because 2K will literally allow you to make more jumpers more often with certain jumpers, because it does not allow a normal  window for end-of-release defense (LaMarcus Aldridge is notorious for being very difficult to fully contest).",2016-10-05 20:52:22+00:00,d8fjkou,3.0,t1_d8fhoqk,2344.0,NBA2k

102,"High rank DVa here...

You are a frontline, main tank. You ought to be in front and aggresive. Defense matrix when focused. On CD, be prepared to retreat. Steal large healthpacks often by flying. Fly/Melee/Shoot is basically 100 guaranteed damage and is a powerful way to assassinate offense heroes, and Zens... use it everytime you move in for a kill. DVa can pick off targets pretty well, in general. Shoot EVERYTHING! You have shotguns with an infinite mag, play like it and bring barriers down or whatever. GTFO when Zarya goes after you hard, she is a DVa-destroying machine. Murder large monkeys, farm ult on hogs, protect your healers with DM when focused (she is an allied Zen/Mercy best buddy), protect aggresive DPS heroes in the front line (allied Reapers/Tracers/Genjis love her), assassinate Zens and low health targets, or targets cut off from the team. Enemy ult = DM and protect time! DVa shuts down Pharah, Reaper, McCree, S76, and Roadhog HARD... and if your spidy-sense is tingling, it can stop the projectile ult from Zarya (!!), Mei, Hanzo, Tracer and a few others!

Push people off the map by flying. Why not? Knock Lucios off their poles! Push Reapers/healer assassins back, or knock an offense hero into a bad spot. You fly every 5 seconds or so, might as well annoy and damage the enemy with it.

You can fly while DM is up! Helpful tip for the aggresive DVa.

Use her ult from a distance... Aim up at a slightly higher than 45 degree angle and start flying, immediately activate your ult. Done right, the MEKA will detonate just above the enemies' heads with no time to escape. Bonus points if you can initiate it behind a wall. It combos with Mei and Zarya extremely well, too. Just make sure there is a bunch of enemies grouped up, preferably in a wide open area with little cover. If you're on point and need to explode, fly a good bit up in the air first and let it drop so it explodes above the enemy in the air, grounded bombs are the easiest to dodge.

Out of MEKA, get way in the backline and jump around like a maniac farming ult on tanks to get MEKAs back quickly. Little DVa is an easy kill so play like a scared little girl until you get your MEKA back.

Value your MEKA. Yes you have two lives but little DVa doesn't do much besides a little extra DPS, while her MEKA can be a gamechanger.

Did I mention shoot, fly into/away from, or defense matrix ALL the things? Don't just sit there and idle like a MEKA on a log!",2016-09-07 02:42:34+00:00,d7ccbzk,,t1_d78xtsi,,OWConsole
103,"Reaper (1st golden guns): Easy, powerful. Awesome ult, great escape. Badass, looks cool, destroys tanks and eats Zenyatta for breakfast.

Pharah: Great on console, can really rain hell down on enemies. Particularly effective at eliminating defense heroes, Reapers, healers and Reinhardts.

DVa (2nd golden guns): I love her. Awesome ult, new defense matrix is beastly, and pretty effective at killing annoying offense heroes, finishing off low health enemies, and leading the charge. Cute, bae.

Zarya: Might be the best hero in the game. Best ult, high self-sustain, hard to kill, melts at high charge... she is a one-woman army and a must-have on every team, IMO. Not a fan of her skins but her gun is cool as hell, though.

106,"S76 really relies on good tanks to be at his best. At lower levels, you can safely assume you won't have that luxury. His helix rocket is amazing and gives you a 150 damage burst if you land the direct hit, use it as a finishing move or to help burst down threatening tanks and bastions. Learn to burst fire (4 bullets, ideally) and aim for the head, and don't forget to GTFO of sticky situations by sprinting like a maniac. (I am very high rank and have survived many bad situations by dropping my biotic field and sprinting around it in a circle while I heal, lol)

Tracer is one of the best heroes at 1vX and doesn't necessarily need good healers or good tanks to do well, although they always help. The first thing to do with tracer is learn to win a 1v1 vs. every hero. Tracer is a hero that is best played very predicatively -- by anticipating, baiting, and dodging the enemy ability or positioning that gives them the upper hand and blinking a millisecond BEFORE they use it, such as but not limited to Roadhog hooks, Hanzo scatter arrow and nock time, S76 helix rockets, Zarya shields and McCree flashbangs. She has far too low health to try and play reactively. Other general Tracer tips: be sneaky and use the element of surprise, stay in open areas instead of tight quarters, switch targets freely and avoid tunnel vision, stick your pulse bomb, learn where health packs are and use them very liberally, recall resets your health back to where it was 3 seconds ago, acting as a heal (it also leaves you invulnerable for 1.5 seconds, useful for not dying to ults), learn and judge the blink distance to maximize the damage potential of your pistols (they have ridiculous DPS up close but falloff at range), remember that you can blink in every direction (including backwards and at angles), aim for headshots (especially on cleanly-flanked enemies), GTFO when focsued too hard, always go for the enemies busy shooting other teammates. Tracer is a pest, a mosquito -- focus on disrupt-and-escape and make it a point to go for low health enenies attempting to flee battle and finish them off.

Learn the hell out of Zarya (and Roadhog to a lesser extent), they are high-DPS tanks with high self-sustain that can lead the team in kills and damage while maintaining position on the objective at lower level play.

Lucio is still the best healer in the game -- if you find yourself on a team surrounded by good players who have not chosen a healer, Lucio is the go to.",2016-09-06 12:58:13+00:00,d7bf5wh,1.0,t3_51erui,4656.0,Overwatch

Mastering the cat and mouse game and having the situational awareness to position yourself correctly, evade enemies, time rezs, damage boost and heal the appropriate allies at the right times... A good Mercy is a difference maker. 

And as a DPS, if I can get both supports with my ult, I will do it every single time without hesitation. A structure without its foundation surely falls.

Q in groups of 3 or 4. 5/6 is difficult since you can go against suprisingly beastly teams, and solo/duo Q is bad at lower levels since randoms can't always be trusted.

Get really good at Zarya. In the lower ranks she can carry hard by racking up gold medals while holding the objective.

Get really good at an Offense hero, and learn to achieve a high k/d with a lot of kills. Past 60 or so, they make a big impact.

Always talk in team chat.

Play quarterback. A simple plan is always better than no plan. A simple 222 team comp of anyone is better than the alternative. ""Speed boost us through the left"", ""play the objective instead of the choke"", ""help me focus down that Roadhog, he's wrecking us"", ""get back to point, we are overextending"", ""we need a tactical regroup, we just got wiped"", ""lets get behind our Reinhardt and back him up"".

If someone makes a bad meta pick like Hanzo/Widow/Symmetra, look at their profile and ask them to play a meta-friendly hero they have a lot of time on, and always say please and thank you. People generally respond well when they are asked to switch to a character they still like. If you get a win, tell them good job after the match and summarize why them playing X instead of Y helped win the game.

Get on a win streak. That's where the big XP is.

Remember that this game heavily favors attackers. Keep the morale high after you struggle on defense, chances are suprisingly good that you will do the same thing back to them.

Stalling the objective wins games. Lucio/Genji/Tracer/DVa/Mei can win games just because they can survive longest in a 1vX.

Basic strategy, get a pick on offense and bumrush onto point. Prioritize staying alive on defense and do not overextend or play overly risky. Use support ults defensively to stop Death Blossom and Dragonblades. Combo offensive ults with enough delay to force a defensive ult and then respond with another offensive ult after it goes down. Wiping a team is always better than poking to death, and is sometimes downright necessary to stop the snowball.

Ana needs to aim. Mercy can heal out of LoS, around corners, and can be looking behind her, around her, wherever. Mercy can repeatedly fly across the map to stay alive or reposition, while Ana has to stall and wait for her team, or hit her sleep dart, which is difficult especially on a decent Genji or Tracer that is tough to hit with any kind of anything.

Going by the numbers, yes Ana has the best ST healing in the game. That's if your target is standing still or has a big hitbox. Healing high-mobility heroes is difficult, and target switching is slow compared to Zen or Mercy. Ana has a high skill ceiling and a lot of variability while Mercy is simply cat-and-mouse and pretty consistent... her healing is more intuitive.

I guess my point is that Ana and Mercy are much closer to *practical* HPS because Ana (especially on console) is NOT going to hit anywhere close to every healshot, while Mercy literally cannot miss.

Ana has some serious advantages (DENYING healing is crazy), but I still consider Mercy to be a better true healer strictly speaking.

I play a ton Reaper, and I can tell you that he one of the most picked DPS in the game regardless of map or side. Basically every team I play against has one, and when I dont pick him on my team, someone else will.


Pharah and Genji are also really popular on console and you are all but guaranteed to see one of them every game. They are both much harder to deal with because of aiming limitations. Pre McZen, Pharah and Pharmercy was a terror. 


McCree (and Soldier) aren't quite as prevalent, one of them get picked in maybe 50% or so of games, mostly to counter Pharah or because of the map/situation/composition.


Junkrat is seen a lot more too, especially on defense or KOTH. Maybe 10 or 20 percent pick rate. The other defense heroes are pretty rare.


Lucio is mandatory without exception. Zen is close to mandatory, although a third DPS gets his slot sometimes.

NBA 2K16 is probably the best basketball sim ever made. Every mode is fantastic and very deep, from MyGM (which is the experience you are looking for), to MyTEAM to MYCAREER and ProAM/Park. There is untold amounts of hours you can put into 2K, and you can really tweak things to your preferences a LOT. If you want to get good at the game, the skill cap is pretty high, both in terms of stick skills, but also BBIQ and what not. If you can't commit much time to the game, the skill ceiling is low enough that any true fan of the NBA can have fun with the game. And if you don't care about the user gameplay at all, you can sim games, or even watch the CPU play games against itself and tweak the sliders for more entertaining gameplay. There is all sorts of macro- and micro-management... you can own a team, be the GM, relocate, rebrand, have fantasy drafts, scout prospects, sign big FAs, control rotations, edit playbooks, hire and fire coaches... it's all there.

I have competitive experience on Ghost Recon Online (on PC) -- formed one of the best competitive tournament NA clans (Warmup Tryhards) from two other large clans I had been apart of (404/NK.), and was a top 50 assault in a very crowded leaderboard. I was a beast at that game, and so was my clan! We beat some of the best teams and even won a few tourneys. Good times, that game... had a 1000 hours on one class, lol.


Also played in NBA 2K's first foray into eSports, dubbed Road to the Finals. Was a part of Alwayz Open as the point guard. Have played in team-up leagues and won championships.


I played CoD: WaW and CoD: 4, what seems like forever ago. Me and a friend were #1 doubles partners for a while on WaW on Gamebattles.


I feel like I'm good enough to be a useful component on a winning team, although I'd be lying if I didn't say I have plenty of room to get a lot better, both individually and as a teammate. I'm pretty laid back, have a good mic, and communicate. I'm 23 with no job ATM, so I have a flexible schedule (although I'm more of a night owl for sure). I live in OKC, so that means I'm in CST. 


Anyways, I'd love to be on a good team. Hit me up if you are looking for someone!

156,"Genji: Someone almost always uses him, often two. The time I have used him I stunk... couldn't kill anything, died easily, and got Mei'd a bunch. Can't get his ultimate to work for me, nobody shoots my reflect, and I don't do much damage. Not my character.

Widowmaker: I'm no good at sniping, in any game ever. Don't have any fun because I'm either missing a ton of easy shots and getting frustrated, or running back from spawn.

Hanzo: Unlike WM, I had some fun with him. The arrow hit boxes are forgiving, and I like his abilities. But he is so popular it's hard to use him, especially when your team needs a tank or healer. 

Zenyatta: Too squishy, no mobility. I like his damage a lot but most team comps don't fit my usage of him (i.e. behind large blue rectangle).

D.Va: I liked her in the beta, but can't really find a use for her. Not bad though.

Reaper: I really WANT to be good with him, because he has sweet skins and a cool kit. But I can't ever do well with him. I'm not good at flanking and when I try too hard get better I end up not playing the objective and being useless. I don't win 1v1s and generally do not pull my own weight. Need practice with him.

I'm not really good with the Offense heroes. I like McCree but he will be nerfed on console soon, and I don't want to get used to him in his current state, only to hate using him post nerf. Just holding off mostly, for now. I like Pharah but I can never seem to get many eliminations and I suck with her ultimate. I usually get gold for damage dealt though. Soldier is a ton of fun to play and feels effective, but he is so undeniably generic and easy that it makes me not want to use him. I hate Genji and stink with Reaper. Tracer is kinda 'meh'.

162,"I'm in OKC, playing on the PS4. I can find games within 20 seconds at any time, on any day, in any game mode (except the online MT challenges, those can take a while sometimes). The AH is usually packed full of cards, and every refresh you see lots of new cards. The whole experience is completely hacker-free. I play this game way too much and still haven't seen one, yet.

Graphics are great, FPS is smooth, the controller is ergonomic and sensible. PSN is pretty reliable.

The community is packed... Park has hundreds of people running around at any given time, the Stage usually has 50-100 people; both having many instances at that. Pro-am matchmaking is excellent in terms of quickness and reliability. There are multiple Pro-am leagues, multiple team-up leagues, 1v1 leagues everywhere. PlayNow online is instantaneous. Chances are you'll run into somebody famous as you play, whether it be an NBA star, YouTube personality, or whatever. In general, the population is always booming, and there is always games to be had, and in many ways. 

2K pushing the eSport status on the PS4/XB1 and snubbing the PC is a good indicator of where the pulse of the game is at.

I'd say the PS4 is better than the XB1 because of the community size alone, although I'd personally vouch for the UI and better hardware the PS4 sports as well, but that is a very big and overplayed debate for another place and time. Either one would be an upgrade for online 2K.

Main problems with consoles are pre-pubescent children or drunk teens with open mics throwing tantrums and shouting all sorts of obscenities, people who will send you strongly-worded messages after losses, people who pause after every damn thing, and people who exploit every last exploitable thing in the game (thank goodness 2K16 has severely limited exploits). Just par for the course -- the larger a community gets, the more toxic it becomes, especially on consoles.

Past 2K, neither platform is packed with must-play exclusives -- they each have a few nice games but PC is obviously blows both out of the water (with perfect backward capability going back a long time). No mods on console, either. High-end PCs are usually going to have better graphics, framerates and higher resolutions on the same games. You are also stuck with the controller, for better (sports and fighting games) and for worse (shooters and MOBAs). Consoles are easier to use and have an awesome social aspect -- ridiculously easy to add and play with friends, talk in parties, and usernames never really change. Every game is integrated with PSN perfectly. Consoles also get better support, usually -- rarely have obscure technical issues and most games are optimized to run very well.

166,"I spend 20-30% of the time off-ball...

---

I use it when the opponent calls an ISO that clears the paint completely (I switch on to the C, who is usually in no man's land, to provide drive side help).

I also very occasionally try and intercept predictable passes.

If I get beat 1v1, the CPU will help and the defense will rotate off a shooter. Instead of going for a chasedown block or trying to keep playing defense out of position when help is already there, I just rotate on to the shooter that CPU rotates off of.

In PnR situations I will off-ball in a few ways... Either to compensate for the corner to big rotation or force a switch when the CPU is being slow.

And on fast breaks I will occasionally off ball, depending on the situation, to cover the shooter the CPU always leaves open.

I always run my C back on D to prevent the easy lead passes, this usually means a second or two off-ball.

Sometimes the CPU will switch on to the guy I'm guarding for no reason. If this happens, I run the guy that was supposed to be guarding the ball-handler over to the man the CPU left open for no reason. 

I will sometimes switch on to a trailer and make sure they are guarded properly, since the CPU will inexplicably leave forwards open for three and/or susceptible to off ball cuts.


---

Basically all my off-balling is to compensate for the CPU's defensive IQ shortcomings/predictability and make sure nobody is left open. 

In Guantlet, I will off-ball on people that can't shoot, because the CPU will face guard them for no reason. It's an easy way to win, sorry if you hate me for it but I hate Guantlet anyways.

In Guantlet I will off-ball PnRs if the third guy is an elite shooter, because the CPU will leave them open every stinking time. 

If someone hop steps into the paint, and I have help from a big or the paint is clogged, I'll go guard an open shooter if there is one, instead of doubling the guy under the basket with no dribble. Mostly Guantlet, but does happen on occasion in RTTP, too.

I might off-ball if I am getting absolutely torched. This is super rare and usually Guantlet. One time I had some slow, short, old bronze big vs. Diamond KAT. He was murdering me so hard I had to stop the bleeding and off-ball to try to help. I ended up winning that game 28-26, absolute thriller.

Some, if not several, of these situations can be avoided by Smother/Deny, but I refuse to use that because a very experienced player will score on it every single time. 98% of the player base has no idea what to do, but the 2% that do will abuse it the whole game.

175,"As far as dunking and layups go, you need to use the stick to pick directions. Because of this, I strongly recommend Absolute over Camera Relative, because it is easier to choose your animations from different parts of the court.

Dunking -- right/left chooses one-handed dunk with selected hand, up (towards basket with CR) to do a two-handed dunk, and back (away from basket with CR) to attempt a flashy dunk (also used to trigger posterizer dunks more often).

Knowing when to use Euros and Hops is important, but difficult. They'll throw off the timing for blocking shots and get fouls (hops into a pump fake especially). Euros are good when you have 1 defender to beat who has good position, the long strides typically draw more fouls and harder to time the block. They are also good when a defender is set on a definitive side of the basket waiting for you, since you can fake going to that side to keep them honest and then use the basket to protect your finishing move. Hops are a quick decisive move to beat a defender who is over- or under- pursuing... Hopping into a fake on an overpursuing defender that is trying to get a block is a guaranteed foul, and hopping and finishing decisively on an underpursuing defender allows you to take advantage of your position. 

Reverses typically protect the ball. If you go baseline and the other side is unprotected, use that.

Tear drops are great when you are bursting into the lane and notice the defender waiting right under the bucket for you -- your floater will go undefended. Careful with defenders coming from the sides.

Shorter guards that can't dunk need to be careful with defenders chasing them down. If you have a decent dunker, it's an easy finish. But if you can't dunk, you need to be careful.

Sometimes the best way to finish is to attempt a standing layup instead of a driving layup, the difference in animations and timing can really throw the defense off.

In general, keep the ball away from the defense and protect it, or try and get contact.",2016-06-03 02:10:48+00:00,d3txyii,1.0,t3_4m9kvi,16059.0,NBA2k

I don't know your current MT situation, so it's going to be hard for me to recommend someone to replace either Moses or Bird. 

---

That said, let's start with Moses.

Do you like to post? 

If no....

Amethyst Biyombo is probably the best C in the game if you don't care for the post.

If sometimes...

Diamond Wilt is pricey, but worth it. Almost as good as Bis, but has a middy and a great post game, in addition to being 7'1"".

If a lot...

DPOY Hakeem. Self-explanatory.

If die hard C's fan...

Bill Russell can rep Boston well. Similar to Bis, just a notch below athletically and as a finisher. Has a hook and some post control, not bad in an emergency.

---

On to Bird.

Diamond Bird is the same thing, but with a way higher 3 ball. If you like Bird a lot, this is a straightforward upgrade.

If you don't like him or want to switch it up, Aminu is a good two-way player that can hit 3s all day, get boards, and defend well.

Durant can be played at PF... If you grab LBJ and like KD, there's no reason to take KD out.

If you have MT to spare, check out Millsap, Green, LMA or even Towns. They have some unique upsides -- LMA is a post god, Green is a Bird-esque all-arounder, with a lot more athleticism at the expense of a post game. Towns is a face up god, runs like a gazelle and can get to any spot on the floor in seconds, while keeping 4 out spacing. Millsap is in between everyone, has a little bit of everything.

Is TBT LBJ worth it? Absolutely. Better ball control, better driving dunk, better contact dunk, better draw foul, better driving layup, faster, quicker, better at floaters, better at shooting, has better hotspots and jumps higher.

198,"Well, your perimeter defense is pretty poor. I'd start there. Moses is not the best C in the world and is a relatively poor rim protector, so that would be the next thing I'd try to upgrade. Really need some more defense, size, and physicality with your starting unit.

That version of Bird is kinda weak, IMO. Bird with a weak 3pt just doesn't look or feel right, to me.

DeRozan and Durant are great, but you don't have a bone fide, god-tier slasher. TBT LBJ would be a very good pickup for you -- he brings the defense and a slasher mentality, as well as a Floor General.

I don't like IT. In game, I mean (he is awesome IRL, he's a mighty mouse). He is so short it makes him a very obvious target on D, and he can't finish at the rim nearly as well as his ratings would indicate. I think Curry is actually straight up better in every facet of the game, and would be a better fit. I'd drop IT and invest in someone else -- Playoffs Kyle Lowry has the same sort of play style IT has, but is a few inches taller, with more defense and a better release.

As perfect as KAT is, Diamond AD might be the only guy that's even better. Not sure what the MT situation looks like, but if you have a bunch, he'd improve your starters and your bench (since KAT would be on the bench instead). Porzingis KAT are still both really good, so upgrading to AD isn't exactly a pressing issue.

You don't have a great pick and fade guy. What I mean by that is, all of the guys in your lineups will want to fade to the midrange and hurt your spacing. Draymond Green just so happens to be one of the few guys who will consistently fade to the three point line. And with the new Diamond version, he might be well worth picking up with how good at everything he is. Matched up on the PF on defense he's lock down, and is more than capable of helping Melo run your offense via the PnF if your offense ever stagnates.

Moments George is probably the best wing in the entire game when running 5 out. He's big, fast, strong, has a 94 3pt, finishes, locks people down, grabs the occasional defensive board, and runs in transition. I'd rather him start and play more minutes but that's just me.

I'd replace Mullin with Playoffs Deng. He is a very slightly worse shooter and much better at everything else. He's also cheap.  I made the same upgrade and was very pleased by the results.

Harden has awful defense and might be under utilized if KD is the main man off the bench. Speaking of which, TBT LBJ is a God in this offense. Hell, he has more or less orchestrated an offense like this IRL, multiple times. KD could be moved to where Harden is, he's still an offensive monster, but has more size and defense than Harden and lets you spend your MT elsewhere.

Melo is an awesome pick. He's probably the best offensive card in the game and you're going to ask him to control your offense and make things happen, which is perfect. Badge him out and give him Dimer. I'd also run the occasional PnR with Towns once Melo heats up to get Melo open for 3 and give the defense another headache to worry about.

Oscar is solid, but lacks elite athleticism, dunking, a go-to post move, sizeups, and 3 point shooting. He is good at all of those, but not elite in any of them. He does have best in class defense and rebounding. He has no glaring weaknesses, but he is a jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none kinda guy. Whether or not that is what you are looking for, I'm not sure. Since you run your offense through LBJ anyway, you can really forgo a PG and get another wing to hit 3s, play good D, snag defensive boards, run the break and finish at the rim. PG is elite at all of those things. You don't necessarily need another playmaker either, you already have KD and Dr. J which are more than capable secondary and tertiary playmakers. And I mean hell, PG can create his own shot pretty damn well for a 4th option.

JR is a good value for the MT with one of the best jumpers in the game, but I really feel like PG brings everything to the table you are looking for. Putting LBJ at PG is just taking out the middle man and letting you get the ball into the hands of the best shot creator in the game every trip down the court. I mean, he's certainly capable and with a roster like yours, you aren't exactly hurting on ball handlers or offense initiators.

A focus, an idea of who they want with the ball, who they want setting the picks, etc. That same offense has 3 and D guys that can make the D pay for doubling, but lock up on D. Look at the Warriors, the Spurs, the Heat. 

Let's say, if KD is only shooting threes for example, then he is a waste of talent. He's not using his elite ball-handling, post game, or getting to the bucket. That isn't a problem per-se, but why have him on the court when you can Amethyst Klay, then? Klay is a better shooter, and can lock up on D. He does his one job on offense and does it well, and is an effective plus on defense with his lateral quickness, BBIQ, pass perception and shot contest. Or Curry -- if you aren't hitting floaters and layups, using his elite playmaking, then why have him to just hit spot up threes when there are two-way players that are taller and stronger that can hit them just as well?

There is no way of utilizing all those players all the time if they are all in at the same time. This is the concept of ball-dominance.

Anything with the players' normal jumpshot animation (and the off-the-back-foot/protect jumpers you sometimes get) count as standing.

The takeaway here is that standing is much more important than moving, since the type of shots that count as moving are already much lower percentage than a standing shot from the same place on the floor.

Moments KAT, although he might qualify as being expensive. 6'11"" C with an 84 3 ball and 86 speed. Lots of fun. Put him at PG every once in a while against someone with a mic on. Guaranteed WTF every time.

Amethyst Magic Shaq, also borderline expensive. Feels like Shaq, crams the ball on top of peoples' heads. Looks cool, looks enormous. Is cool. Is enormous. Whisper ""barbecue chicken"" every time you post up or dunk. Wet ball FTs, Shaq a 80% at the line.

David Thompson, just a beast. Cool looking player model, best contact dunker I've used so far. When he gets hot, the amount of BS this man produces going to the rim is awesome (for you, anyway). The PA announcer says SKYWALKER in a really cool fucking voice everyone he scores.

LeBron. I just like his style. Beast. Everytime LBJ makes a good play, I say ""Bitch, I'm LeBron!"" Can't argue with that. Wonder if he ever does that IRL? Like if I'm guarding him and he shits on me while saying that, the hell can I even say? ""Bitch, where's my help?"" doesn't sound too good.

Curry. Swagtastic layups. Can be frustrating, hard shot. When he's hitting, he drops bombs from everywhere. Did I mention Skyfucker lives up to his name with his layups? It's like a slap in the face every time he lays it up. Like bitch I'm not even trying out here.

David Robinson. Sweet jumper, DPOY strips  people like a guard. Pretty fast for a 7'1"" dude. Looks like he could rip you in half. Probably can rip you in half.

Grant Hill. 6'8"", 93 speed. A blur. Looks ripped. Big ears, big jams. Nice middy. I bet this man has good hearing.

Feels like every center is your personal bitch in the post (not always true, but the thought is what counts).

Moments Porzingis. Tall, athletic, can hit 3s. Best shot blocker I've personally used in the game, because of his height + vertical. Has nice hair, I want to touch his hair.

For a 4-out Offense, I'd sub in Harrison Barnes st the 4. Solid defender and rebounder, can run the floor and finish, and has an 84 3 ball.

274,"Mentioned Ewing only because it meant the opponent was skilled enough to beat the 1st seed -- not exactly difficult, but at least shows he isn't complete garbage -- wasn't saying he was a beast in comparison to Wilt/Shaq/Dwight, because he isn't half of what they are on D or the glass.

That one game was one example. I've actually ran this set (and variations of it) for a while. Yes, I do get outrebounded, and somewhat consistently (depending on opponent). I'm just saying that I've never had a game where I felt rebounding was a determining factor (I probably win ~80-85% of my games). 

Regarding the bigs, I don't see what you mean with the speed. KAT, AD, Draymond and Porzingis are going to be at the C on Defense, and they all have some of the best lateral quickness in class. What Center is going to blow by them? I actually would recommend AGAINST Dirk (in lieu of AD or Porzingis). Yes, their shots are slow, but at least in the case of KAT, AD, Draymind and Porzingis, they are so fast that they can exploit late closeouts by a pumpfake and drive to the paint. They'll got stopped sometimes for sure, but you can't lock them down 100% just because of semi-slow releases (Porzingis in particular has a pretty quick release IMO). 

AD, KAT, and Porzingis (and Green, for that matter) all have good shot contest ratings. With Gold Eraser, they aren't exactly pushovers and should keep the rim pretty well-protected. They aren't diamond Wilt or Shaq, but it's not like they are going to get ran over like they aren't there or anything.

Also, Shot Contest has no impact on fouls. Rather, the player's foul tendency dictates how often they wlll foul.

Anyways, it is by no means a perfect system and you make some good points. It's a pretty fun and modern system that offers a lot of freedom at the expense of some rebounding and paint defense. It also puts pretty heavy focus on two players dictating the offensive effectiveness which can be a negative.",2016-04-20 20:46:06+00:00,d2au2t2,5.0,t1_d2asvzv,1460.0,NBA2k

AD's offensive rebounding won't be as noticeable (4-out), and George will defend other 4-out lineups BETTER than AD (AD is better in the post, but not MASSIVELY or anything).

Obviously you aren't going to have the same rim protection a conventional twin-tower setup would offer, but I don't feel it's as much a detriment as you'd think. In general, I feel IQ is very overrated on this sub in general -- tall, athletic bigs with good raw stats play just as good defense as super smart guys. In my experiences, the way the D rotates is almost always the same regardless of who is at C. I've run Porzingis at C against diamond squads with Rewards Ewing (proving first seed victory) and had him shut down people at the rim time and again. Same with KAT. It's not too hard to switch on to them and neutralize their lower IQ if the opponent decides to go ISO ball. Personal conjecture aside, your perimeter D should be elite with 3&amp;D guys all over the floor. It's no different than the Warriors IRL. 

Sagging a big on LeBron isn't always going to be effective. For one, you concede that LeBron can attack 1v1 into the paint -- never a good idea. It goes both ways -- if you sag I will be able to pull out the fastest ISO crossover in the game less than a half second before going up. I can hit them with a baseline dunk, euro them into a foul, hop step, tear drop, use the post to abuse momentum... It's very difficult to hold a guy like LeBron to a low percentage in the paint, at the rim, on constant 1v1s. Big guys move so slow laterally you can often just maneuver into a good angle. And I mean, the sliders have been adjusted so that if you leave him so wide open there is absolutely no contest at all, you'll get plenty of A/A- quality shots that go in. It's even worse when it's TBT LeBron (either one), they have mid 80's three balls that drop consistently. If the opponent is constantly conceding wide open threes and doesn't want to change, I'll go the right corner trigger point where his hotspot is and abuse gold Corner Specialist. And if the opponent is stupid enough to continue letting that happen, then I'll put someone in with Gold Dimer and Floor General and drain 3 after 3. It's really not a good or viable strategy. Besides, I can always counter by putting in MVP Durant at C. Now you HAVE to guard him. And if LeBron was getting 1v1s the whole game, that means A. The PnF defense is leaving 1 guy to guard two shooters and B. You have denied shooters off-ball.

- You have to match up vs. a high OVR team, 87+. This isn't rankings, to make it clear. This is the accumulative quality of the opponents' myplayers themselves, regardless of the human user playing as said myplayers. It tells you the OVR in the pre-game overview with the elevator music.

- They have to suck and not quit.

- Have to play VERY fast tempo. Break Starter on 2 Cs and lots and lots of cherrypicking NECESSARY. Need at least 100+ points. Chuck threes with small outside guards, abuse Dimer and Corner Specialist as much as possible. Do not turn the ball over, at all. Very costly.

- Employ a full-court trap, double-team the ball-handler (I basically ran around like an idiot chasing the ball and doubling while my teammates baited and recovered... have gold Gym Rat and Hardened if you play my role), and play scramble defense to force shots/decisions quickly. Steals/blocks and fast shots (good or bad) is way better than D'ing up for 24 seconds and letting time tick away. The golden standard of fundamental defense is meaningless in this format. This also mentally encourages your opponents to stay since they will have small successes and ups-and-downs instead of locking them down entirely and sapping their will to continue.

- Rack up a lot of rebounds, assists, steals and blocks.

- Don't overplay your matchup so hard they get kicked for a bad grade. If they have a D, let them get their grade up. You do not want to add any computers into the mix, they make things way harder.

- EVERYONE MUST GET A FULL-BAR A+ BEFORE THE END OF THE GAME. Huge difference maker, gets you a shit ton of points. The event is impossible without a full 5 because of this. This also means 1 guy getting kicked or lagging out in a game is immediate failure of said game, effectively.

- Every point, every play, every stat, every last second matters. Gotta go 100% the whole game and event day, not the least bit of let up or messing around. It's so important that we often intentional fouled at the end of the game to score more baskets, up 50 or more. Treat every second like it's critically important.

- Play all 12 hours of the event. Get chips, candy, beer, caffeine. Avoid breaks of any kinds. Time not playing is time wasted. Start games immediately. Call in sick from work if possible/necessary. Yes, no-lifing. It is what it is.

- Close app vs. low OVR teams. Call it whatever you want, it's a waste of time and no amount of complete and utter dominance will get you high scores. Not worth it. Even winning by 100 won't cut it, don't try.

- Mic up and talk. Communication is key. We theory-crafted schemes to find the information I'm putting here through talking it out. It's also super boring and shooting the shit with your mates can help make it go smoother.

Me, our team, and everyone participating doesn't like how this is setup. Puts emphasis on all the wrong things (boosting, teammate grades, luck, unsportsmanlike gameplay, lack of true skill, etc.) . Should go by power rankings and include more participants, more like March Madness or something.

He is a dominant traditional big with elite shooting, which you use to run Pace 4-out and run Pick and Fades, allowing you to have a 5-out, which is a dreamland for a couple of slashers to destroy the defense. You'll also have lots of room to work the post and hit cutters. The opposing big can't back off to defend the cuts, because if he does, he leaves the best midrange and post fadeaway bigman to ever play the game wide open for easy buckets.

For two, it takes 10 seconds to permanently matchup a guy like Kawhi on him and completely neutralize the mismatch. I swear, 90% of the people who complain about this don't understand that this changes nothing. LBJ is gonna bring the ball up like he would at any other position anyway (he is a play initiator). For three, he doesn't bring a whole lot more to the offense than one RWB/Wall does, besides some extra size and a post game.

In fact, putting LBJ at PG is a misuse of him I  some ways. LeBron is so good in transition, you want him running the break. LeBron is an elite post defender, and a good rebounder besides. It is flat out SMARTER on the LBJ-user to put him at a position where he will better utilize the completeness of his game.

Fist 91 Side can get Curry open, either as the handler or off the spot up. AKA Double Dragon, see Sam Pham video.

Important thing with Curry is to get inside too. It's tempting to chuck threes but he is a crafty finisher inside (hit towards the basket on the stick for best animations) and is particularly nasty at floaters.

Another thing to remember is that he is a very high-profile shooter that any smart human should do anything they can to deny open shots. This mentality can be manipulated in your favor to get assists, breakdowns, and layups.

Lastly, the defense will occasionally play ridiculously tight off the ball (and if a user sets deny, somewhat often). When the defender is holding Curry (this goes for anyone else too), you can tell him to cut with triangle for an easy layup, provided there is decent spacing.

1981-1990 is chronologically correct in the sense that there was no 0 year (no 0 AD), and thus our current calendar started at year 1, so the 1st decade was 1-10, the 2nd decade was 11-20, the 199th decade was 1981-1990, and so on. But a decade is only a term for a period of 10 years, and thusly does not need to be affixed to the Georgian calendar proper to be correct. Hell, 1985-1994 is a decade, since it is a span of 10 years, full stop. 

1980-1990 is completely wrong since that is eleven years and by definition is not a decade (count on your fingers, starting with 1980 and ending with 1990).

407,"Interestingly, I've actually demoed this type of idea using the Motion 4-1 in a HoF/Sim game with fatigue off, by taking the official 2K injury-free roster and outfitting my small-ball line-up of Curry/Thompson/Barnes/Iguodala/Green with Gold Brick Wall, Dimer, and Pick and Roll Maestro (which, to my knowledge, does indeed trigger on off-ball screens). I did not alter the ratings or other badges in any way, The results were pretty staggering -- I was able to beat the injury-free Cavaliers on the highest difficulty setting in the game by shooting nothing but threes and swinging the ball around the perimeter (I barely had to dribble at all.) 

Seems like the ideal lineup would consist of Curry, three elite 3&amp;D wings and a dominant rebounder/defender who can finish off the odd emergency P&amp;R. A sort of concept lineup would be:-

Dynamic Curry


Current Klay


Rewards Mullin


Dynamic Kawhi/George


Moments/Dynamic Drummond

There are a couple of branches that involve a stretch 5 but those are few and far between. I'd rather swing once more and have the best offensive rebounder on the planet have a field day cleaning up misses and protect the rim instead of a very rare opportunity at a three. I think a user would eventually adjust to this online, so a lineup with threatening finishers/shooters like KD would help keep the set fresh as a dual-threat to deal with.

To answer your question directly, Dimer/Brick Wall/P&amp;R Maestro is the way to go IF and ONLY IF you run the Motion 4-1 offensive set.

Eraser is absolutely worth putting on any good defender, since it neutralizes inside scoring badges (you got them backwards, post lockdown neutralizes post badges). It also straight-up lowers the chance at making any given shot near the bucket.

Shot Creator sucks. Only activates on stuff like leaners -- it won't help you in any situation where you take a jumpshot with Klay's normal animation, which is BY FAR the only shoot you should concern yourself with on Klay.

Stepback Freeze is not worth it. Klay's ball control rating is too low to allow him access to the elite stepback animations, so he'll only do the default one, which is decent but not worth the spot IMO.

Deny means that the defender will NEVER leave that man open, no matter the circumstance.

That being said, momentum, rhythm, flow and who is passing them the ball matters. 


Ideally;

- Corner threes with corner specialist

- Double red rings 

- Hotspot 

- Spot ups are better than off the dribble shots 99% of the time

- Wide open enough for the shot to graded A or higher 

- Wide open enough that deadeye wouldn't be necessary

- Waiting a fraction of a second before you begin your shot to set your feet and square up (avoiding the 'off-the-back-foot' release or a dribble pull-up)

- Being home

- Having momentum

- Being passed to by a elite passer (high pass accuracy/iq/vision)

- Dimer badge increasing shot % significantly

- Having a player with the floor general badge on the floor to increase the shooter's 3pt rating

- Having a player with Heart and Soul for more consistency

- Having situational badges like Prime Time, Closer, Alpha/Beta Dog, Wildcard, etc.

- Either not being a volume shooter or shooting a lot with volume shooter

- Having high shot IQ attribute

- Having high offensive consistency attribute
 
- Pick and roll maestro activating

- Shooting in the flow of the offense ('one-motion' shots, no pumpfaking, dribbling, hesitation, teammates in front of you, etc.)

- Getting green releases

- Being confident and comfortable with the player's form and style

- Not over-analyzing the shot meter (it is an inconsistent guide online, switch it to feedback only and memorize the players shot by heart)

- Putting the ball into their shooting pocket instead of them having to catch it and bring it in to the shooting pocket themselves (PASSING IS IMPORTANT)

- Only taking shots you believe will fall (sometimes an open look doesn't have the right 'feel')


Sometimes a shooter will be off, sometimes they will hit everything. If they are consistently off for you, switch them out.


It's not the game (for the most part anyway), it's you. I've had Ray Allen drill 12-17 threes for me today. I've had him shoot 3-10. Had Klay and Korver do the same thing. Shooting is an art.


PS. The opponent will ALWAYS get bullshit to fall. Don't let that faze you, because good players know that bullshit, sooner or later, will stop falling. Sometimes you will hit a D+ shot.

449,"Inside Scoring does not help you dunk at all. That only helps your layups and post game. Athleticism is what you want to max if you want to dunk. The Outside Scoring Style is considerably less effective at dunking, while the Inside style is very good.

Also make sure you have all 15/15 dunk packages equipped, including all three Under Basket packages so you can do standing dunks. Certain dunks are situational; baseline packages need to be specifically activated, many dunks are considered flashy and won't trigger often if you don't flashy dunk, and some only trigger on certain spots on the floor. Off One packages are entirely superior to Off Two because of how much quicker the animations are. The Tomahawks (except for Athletic Front/Side and Ubers Off Two) are fantastic, Drexler is fantastic, Quick Drops and the basic dunks Off One are good, too. 

Once in game, make sure you have Turbo held down (R2/RT), and hold the left stick towards the basket. If you are attempting a dunk while driving, make sure you have forward momentum towards the basket before attempting the dunk otherwise your guy will pull up for a soft ass 5ft jumper. It is harder to dunk straight off passes (especially driving dunks) because a lot of passes in the game this year seem to stop your forward momentum (you notice in vs. modes on fastbreaks frequently).

Your layups package can negatively affect your tendency to dunk. Curry and Rose seem to trigger their signature layups constantly and as a result lower your effective dunk tendency.

Speaking of dunk tendency, if it is the same as last year, your offline MyCareer game performance will change your guys' desire to dunk in certain situations. So if you want to dunk more in Park or whatever, make sure you get a few games of MyCareer in where you never lay the ball up.

Lastly, if there is a Defender under the rim, attempt a Flashy Dunk (away from basket on the right analog stick). That will trigger contact dunks and Posterizer when applicable.

Pro tip: sometimes a 'Power Dribble' where you take one extra step toward the basket with turbo held down, seemingly unnecessary, will help you dunk much more often. ",2015-10-29 03:07:22+00:00,cwgrcrw,2.0,t1_cwg98q1,26678.0,NBA2k

You are a knockdown shooter, have decent ball handling and passing (badges help a lot), can defend fast guards or larger forwards, and can finish at the basket decently thanks to your size/speed.

You have no real weakness, except for maybe your offensive post game, although once you get Post Spin Tech you can catch people with a crafty move.

Kaisich was a well-mannered, relatable moderate with a good record in a swing state. Also made a name for himself.

Carson was calculated and thoughtful with a dose of quick wit. His closing statement and answer to the racism question was perfect. Needs more time to show his stuff.

Huckabee had some nice quips, a brilliant closing and the ethos you'd expect from him. I think he showed he has some fire.

---

Trump and Rand both got screwed by Fox. Trump was excessively targeted with clear bias, and Rand was snubbed hard. The post-debate analysis reinforced these suspicions.

Trump did well with their target audience and made headlines in the face of an attack, but was bombastic, defensive and unprepared.

Rand also did well with their target audience despite little time, but was too argumentative and a touch petulant. Toasted Christie in the process, though.

---

Rubio had his moments but sounded like a traditional politican, though a charismatic one. No big mistakes, but nothing stood out to me, either. Definitely a dark horse to watch out for as President or VP, but tonight wasn't his night.

Cruz hit on his talking points and was clear and concise. But he also sounded like a rhetorical tea party activist who would have trouble winning against Hillary in a general election.

---

Scott Walker sounded bland, boring and uninspired.

Jeb Bush seemed like an establishment, career, dynastic politician who always takes the high-road, states his résumé and follows party lines. 

Chris Christie got beat up. He was a paper lion with a bad track record, divisive ideas, short temper and no leadership.

531,"Just a quick comment on my thought process:

For one, the transformation process sucks. It takes too long, the fear is short-range, it gets interrupted easily and leaves you vulnerable. In ESO lore, people look to Hircine in their most desparate time to become a beast and slaughter their foes. They don't die transforming, the process only empowers them.

For two, the ultimate cost to time in WW form ratio sucks. 400 ultimate is either way too much or the time in WW form is too little. It's just not 'worth' the cost when there is other Ultimates with similar group-killing ability (Standard, Meteor, Dawnbreaker, etc.) that cost less and require next to no management.

For three, there should be something terrifying about a WW, and not just in the status effect, but in the opponents mind. Making them immune to CC makes the onslaught inevitable and leaves you with bursting down the WW (risky) or getting the hell out of there (hard). It would provide a clear advantage that would make you harder to stop in group play, and horrifying in small-scale play. 

I actually think the skills themselves are pretty darn good. A small buff or two would help as well but I think the issues I outlined would make a WW appropriately powerful. 

I think it sucks that so many people use it for Stamina regen alone since the Ultimate itself is pretty garbage, especially considering all the skill points to make it somewhat useful, and now ZOS is going to make even that less viable. I think the actually gameplay in WW is pretty fun. It feels neat to turn into a powerful bloodthirsty beast.

544,"I've beat the first seed numerous times, and lately I haven't lost in a while, beating the first seed undefeated 3 straight times.

I use the Thunder playbook. Good quick-hitting plays that set up fast and get people open and in position to score.

All the P&amp;R are good, especially Horns, Wide and Spread. They are quick hitting enough to chain them easily, and they usually blind side the Defender.

25/24 Punch gets the ball to the post players in good space. One involves a quick cut (25), the other a quick screen to get a switch or open 3 (24), both very good.

Hawk Quick 2/3 and Floppy are good off-ball screens for shooters, and Hawk doubles as a cutter play.

Drag 3 Quick and 91 Fist are good double picks, the former being nearly unstoppable.

Spread 4 High is an excellent High Post play.

The ISO plays all use a P&amp;R to set them up, and they work well.

I run my offense through my 35-badge PD Curry and 26-badge DTF Blake. They carry the load, and do very well using this playbook.

I run plays when the opposing player has good on-ball D (very rare), or when they off-ball. Sometimes I'll run one if my offense has looked bad, or if someone is on fire, or just because I want to look for a particular shot or setup. I'd say I go anywhere from 10% playcalls against a bum to 60% against a baller.

The playbook is vastly underrated, and the only weakness it has is that it isn't one of those playbooks with a bunch of options, check-downs or a ton of passing, a'la Spurs. It puts the ball in the hands of who you run the play for and is designed to get him in scoring position on minimal passes.",2015-06-30 17:42:46+00:00,csnr8vc,1.0,t3_3bgew4,149130.0,NBA2k

546,"Set points of emphasis to; Limit Perimeter Shots, Play Physical Defense, Crash Defensive Glass.

Set shot contest to always, defensive assist and boxout assist to 100.

Set all settings on shooters to Smother/Deny, and Switch on picks, always.

Always play on-ball defense. The conputer is less capable of guarding it than a good human, as crazy as that might sound.

Always play man-to-man defense. Zone allows huge gaps for shooters to spot up in. Dont do it.

Never double-team, and don't gamble with steals, blocks or charges. By doing these you create openings for shooters that wouldn't normally be there.

Don't use L2, ever. Don't put your hands up  ever. They slow you down and put you on skates. Use turbo very sparingly. Stay in front of your man and play as close to him as possible, which is called 'crowding the dribbler'. Initiate contact as much as possible to force the opponent into an unfavourable animation. Do not move around too much, only when you need to.

Have a defender with high Lateral Quickness and Shot Contest. Make sure they have gold Perimeter Lockdown Defender.

It takes practice to hone your on-ball defense skills to shut down the cheese, so don't expect lockdown right out of the gates. You will have failures. You will get crossed and burned. You will probably even lose because your defense wasn't up to snuff. Use this as motivation to learn from your mistakes and improve. The computer is not better, I promise.
