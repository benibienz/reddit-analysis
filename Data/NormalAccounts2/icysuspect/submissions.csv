No one that responded had a meaningful comparison, and Biyombo was unpopular and untested. I decided to try them both out for a while as my C in my 4-1 Pace and Space, Pick and Roll offense. I didn't use my subs the entire time -- so they got to play the whole game with little rest. They set most of their picks for my fully-badged MVP Curry, which was a lethal combo with either card. On defense, I let them play off-ball around 65% of the time, occasionally switching off for a last second block, or to bring drive side help defense in isolation situations. Of course, I played user defense on 1v1 postups. I played about 10 games in RTTP with each. On to the review.

Looking at the two, they are overall very similar. They are both centered (pun intended) around dunks, defense and rebounds. Biyombo sports the more impressive attributes, with 98s in rebounding, shot blocking, IQ, and dunks/layups. DeAndre is a little less impressive, with noticeably lower Offensive Rebounding and Pass Perception, but with much higher ST/MV Close. The other difference is in the Physicals. DeAndre is two inches TALLER than Biyombo at 6'11"", has +3 Vertical and +6 Strength, too. Neither of them can shoot mids or 3s worth a damn, and they are basically the same when it comes to FTs. Neither of them are stripping RWB at half-court, either. And both could probably use Hakeem's mentoring, because they are both garbage at fades, hooks and moves. (although... equipping a Gold Post Spin Technician on either of them is a good idea, they can both do that really well regardless).

---

Movement:

Biyombo flies around the court. Feels like using MVP KD in terms of speed and quickness, which is fantastic for a C. Guards perimeter players effortlessly, and can cheat on shooters and still retreat to the paint quickly enough to contest shots.

DeAndre feels noticeably slower. He feels a lot more like a bigman, and looks the part with the player model the King and the Admiral use. There is a certain gravity with DeAndre -- kind of like you have your toes in quicksand. He's pretty agile after his first two steps, but he doesn't have the 0-100 factor Biyombo has. In return, he seems much more solid when there is contact -- Biyombo will flail like a SF in midair sometimes, while DJ looks the part of a C

I found this inexplicably weird. They have very, very similar movement attributes, and DJ's extra two inches would lead you to believe he is quicker with his longer strides. Not so.

**Advantage: Biyombo** (speed kills)

---

Defense:

Biyombo's quickness enables him to be all over the place defensively, and he does just that. He cuts people off, plays good positional defense, picking passes off, rarely gets beat. He blocks shots from odd angles and hounds guards from behind. Sounds great... but he doesn't seem to be as good of a rim protector proper like DJ. He fouls a lot more than DJ, and he seems to get knocked around. He doesn't block shots very well when he doesn't get a head start... he's not a good 'standing blocker' if you will.

DJ is just the opposite. He doesn't fly around, he stays near his man, near the basket. He doesn't do nearly as well on the perimeter, although he is still much better than most C's. He doesn't block shots from odd angles, and if he needs to take a step before he blocks a shot, it really cuts his percentages. He will still pick off passes, but Biyombo is noticeably better. But when he is in good position to protect the rim, or guarding a post player attempting a standing shot, he is lockdown. Little guards fly into his chest and he stands rock solid, and often blocks the worse attempts. Feels... intimidating. 

**Advantage: Slightly DJ** (because rim protection is the job description)

---

Rebounds:

Biyombo is a beast at getting into position. He seems to always be down there boxing someone out, ready to grab a board. Unfortunately, he coughs up what look like easy rebounds for no reason, occasionally. Bigger players will just fly right past him and grab the board. Still, his positioning is huge. Right place, right time is Biyombo's motto. If the rebound is a 'horizontal' rebound, Bismack has you covered. This also means he gets a lot of little loose balls, tips, blocked shot rebounds, and 50/50s. He is scrappy and it shows.

DJ is again, dissimilar. DJ looks lazy and lost sometimes, and will get boxed out by other C's more often than Biyombo. However, once DJ does get position, the board is guaranteed. He flies up to the heavens to grab it, and he always looks like the biggest brute by the bucket. If it's a vertical rebound, DJ gives you as good a shot at it as anyone.

**Advantage: Slightly Biyombo** (gets more BS)

---

Finishing:

Biyombo is good. He has a lot of good dunk packages, including Under Basket Rim Pulls, which DJ lacks. I wouldn't say he is as exceptional as his attributes say, but he is no average joe. His agility allows him to get blowbys a'la Anthony Davis. Of note, is his his ability to handle the ball. In the open court, Biyombo dribbles like a gangly SF a'la Kevin Durant. This allows him to quickly get to the bucket vs. other Cs.

DJ is shaq-esque. He dunks every time, and he doesn't give a shit. He'll dunk from the weirdest angles and he never goes up soft. This was a problem I had with Biyombo -- sometimes he'd go up soft in traffic and get his stuff packed. Not often, but too much for my taste. Off pump fakes, Biyombo would often do a quick unsatisfactory layup, while DJ is throwing it down unless the defense initiates contact. DJ looks the part of a big, freakish athletic C. In the open court or off drives, he also looks like a big, freakish athletic C. He dribbles like a granny and struggles to maintain possession of the ball or really use his speed/size to his advantage. Lastly, DJ is good at floaters, while Biyombo is grabage at them. It's a nice fallback option.

**Advantage: DJ** (a bigman doing bigman things better)

---

Conclusion: 

2 inches makes a big difference. I noticed this with Current AD and Amethyst Towns too -- despite Towns being bigger, faster and quicker -- AD felt like he could fly on demand.

I guess it all comes down to what you want from your C. Biyombo and DJ bring different attitudes and playstyles. Biyombo feels like a Rodman type -- battling for every damn thing, always getting every little advantage, and taking every inch the opponent gives him. DJ feels like... well DJ, I guess. Big, strong, intimidating, lazy... and when he does his thing, you won't be wondering who did it, or how.

On paper, Bismack has better attributes across the board. Has a whole lot of 98 ratings.
But, DJ is 2 inches taller, and has more vertical and strength. All three of which make an impact on how well a guy dunks, defends and rebounds, especially in 2K.
So, anyone have experiences with the both of them? Was thinking about picking one of them up. I have gold Biyombo right now and he's been solid. Seems to be a pretty great, but you do notice his lack of size at times.

Today I want to talk to you about a VERY fun and effective offense I was able to get going in NBA 2K16.


First things first, let's talk about the premise of the offense. What we want is 5 guys all around the three point line, spaced evenly apart, with nobody inside the arc. We want this as our base set, so we can create our own actions out of it. Unfortunately, the 2K devs did not include an offense like this in the game, so we are left to our own devices on how to figure it out. 

---

The first bit of setup we need to do is with our lineup itself. You want your primary ball-handler and scorer at CENTER. Ideally, a guy like LBJ and KD will excel here. We want someone that can initiate the offense and abuse the lack of bigs in the paint with slashing and post game, hit an open 3 off a pick, and have good enough to playmaking to handle the ball and pass 24/7. This is effectively the PG on our team. Next, you'll want your TRUE center to play PF. The C should be able to shoot, rebound and protect the rim. Guys like KAT, Porzingis, Draymond Green, Dynamic AD, etc. The other three positions can be normal, although 3&amp;D guys who can finish decently at the rim are recommended. Klay, Mullin, Steph, Dynamic Kawhi, TBT Paul Pierce, etc. Make sure one of the guys is capable of playing small-ball PF (i.e. defensive rebounding, some paint D); in the case of LBJ or KD, they can can be the PF just fine.

---

The next thing we need to do is pick our 3pt fade guy. Whoever you pick, put Brick Wall and Screen Outlet on them, as well as Dimer and Pick and Roll Maestro if you can fit them on him. This guy is the second 'wheel' to the offense, and plays a critical part in keeping the offense unguardable. Ideally, this guy should be able to drive and use floaters pretty well, and hit open threes all day long. Refer to my post here for picking the right kind of guy based on tendencies: https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/4fjpk1/quick_note_on_pick_fade_3s_vs_mids/

---

Before the game, make sure you adjust your settings a bit.


Your points of emphasis should be:-

**Offense**

Doesn't Matter

Patient Offense (to stop transition freelance plays)

Some Crash, Others Get Back (for the odd offensive board, don't expect many)

**Defense**

Doesn't Matter

Doesn't Matter

Some Crash, Others Run (to keep the playmaker at C in the backcourt and the shooters leaking out)


Also, make sure you switch your TRUE C at PF onto the opponents' C, and your playmaker onto a different player to keep him from rotating onto the C too often.

---

Getting into the game, there is a little bit more setup left to do. Switch to the Pace offensive set, and Space the Floor. We use Pace over other 4-1 sets because the AI in Pace is intelligent and dynamic and will move according to where the ball is. We choose space the floor, so we can be left to create our own actions and have consistent results. Remember that the C is actually our PG -- make sure he gets the ball as often as possible -- off defensive rebounds, inbounds, as a trailer, everywhere. If you can't get him the ball before the halfcourt offense sets up, make sure you call him over to the ball with a handoff (circle on PS, B on XB) -- don't risk an entry pass -- Pace is not particularly good for entry passes and forcing the ball to him without handing it off results in interceptions.

---

The offense has three trigger points. At the top of the key, on the wing, and in the corner. From these three locations we are free to do whatever we want and have full control over the off-ball actions of our players! Our first action is simply an ISO. The paint will always be empty, so feel free to attack as often as you feel like. (CPU got you depressed? Use a spin or post drive for reliable buckets in ISO) 

Our second action is the PnF with our designated Fade guy. Get into a trigger point (make sure the fader is NOT in the corner if you are in the wing trigger) This maintains our beautiful spacing, and gives us a pick to work off of and make the D sweat and react or get torched. All kinds of possibilities emerge from this one action -- the fader 3, handler 3, handler drive n' dish or finish, fader drive n' dish or finish, swing to open shooter. But that's not all. We can execute a Flush (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcTPebZHXhE), which is effectively a give and go into an empty paint with the fader and handler before he sets the pick, which counters switching. You can slip the pick if they hedge to hard. And by the mere action of using the pick you walk into another trigger area... to run it again. We can also give the fader the ball and execute a PnR, to throw a wrench into the defense's plan. Or just run a PnF into the mid and create yet another look. 

If our opponent denies shooters in settings to reduce the high number of wide open threes, then it's manual off-ball cuts on bodied shooters ALL DAY. No help in the paint, easy layups. Can't deny shooters with 5-out... Else you risk a motherload of points in the paint off PnF drives, ISOs and cuts. 

Yet another action is having the C handoff the ball to a shooter... this is an instant give and go situation. The way Pace works is that if the C doesn't have the ball and is at the three point line, he will CUT. So you can work that into your offense. Not only that, but if you walk out of a trigger area with your C into a trigger area that a different player is already occupying, he will always make a quick cut before coming back out the the three point line -- no manual cut needed.

Make sure you hit the trailing shooters in transition for easy 3's. You can even hit your playmaking C in transition for a good 3/drive situation. This offense is a blank canvas -- you create the action. You can keep it simple, or get advanced and string long combos together -- the off-ball AI is intelligent and will make good decisions off the ball as you flow through your actions.


---


This offense is exceptionally modern and is perfect for a squad outfitted with tons of deadly shooters. It doesn't have a weakness that can't be countered, save for needing to constantly use the C to keep the 5-out going (although, it IS possible to have a temporary 5-out using PnFs WITHOUT the C because of their mechanics). You can chuck threes all day long, and if your opponent denies shooters, then the huge lack of paint defense becomes very easily exploited. Make sure to attack USERS off-baling, since they can be easily scored on if they aren't focused and playing good D instead of slacking hoping the CPU will hold off the onslaught.

The ratio of one to the other seems to be calculated. The larger the differential between them, the more commonplace the dominant tendency will take place.


A high Shot Three and a low Shot Mid-Range will result in consistent fades out to the 3 point line.  After some testing, some of the elite shooters like Curry or Durant have very high tendencies in both, and will frustratingly fade to the mid far too much despite how counterintuitive it is. Most historic players will fade to mid.


Most consistent 3pt faders I've used so far:

Ray Allen

Draymond Green

Paul Pierce

Damian Lillard


The AI behind the PnF is dissapointing, especially on mids. Players that should always fade to 3 will always go mid, and sometimes even close. On fade to mids, the spacing seems a lot worse and makes the play less effective. Occasionally, the AI will cut to the basket off a planned PnF and cause miscommunication and trouble. For the few players who will fade to the 3 point line consistently, the PnF is an amazing tool and will let the ball handler attack the rim in space. Right now I have LBJ and Ray Allen working the PnF on my MyTeam -- it's really effective.


One last note, the C (or PF if the C is roll man) will spot up on the three point line every time a PnF is initiated. They will always cut to the basket after the PnF is finished, no matter the circumstance. I think a smarter AI would help here -- guys like Whiteside should sit in the mid, guys like Shaq should be close to the block, and the AI should cut or space the floor more intuitively based on the defense.",NBA2k,Quick Note on Pick &amp; Fade 3s vs. Mids,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/4fjpk1/quick_note_on_pick_fade_3s_vs_mids/

Today I am going to show you an awesome build that allows you to take advantage of cover in the biggest way possible, allowing you to deal very high damage while taking very little. In PvE, it is an awesome support character that can buff your party in a big way, while having some solid DPS and survivability on the side. And in PvP, you are going to be an immovable juggernaut that can bring down agents with relative ease!

---

Gear

To begin we'll need 3 pieces of Firearms gear, 1 piece of Electronics gear, 1 piece of Stamina gear and a tri-stat holster. Since this is an endgame build, full ilvl 31 gear is recommended. Also, rolling in the upper end of the stat and armor spectrums will make the build better. We'll want to roll +skill power on our backpack and mask, and then roll the rest of our gear to get mod slots and DPS increases (SC damage resilience and Pulse buffs are good skill buffs to get, not needed though) which we'll use to buff up our Skill Power (mainly), Health and Armor (if necessary). Our endgame goal is at least 2500 Firearms, 1900 Stamina and 1900 Electronics. Ideally that, and around ~140k DPS, 60k HP and 35K SP will perfect the build.

The first thing we need is a total armor rating of 3,250+. This is not terribly difficult to achieve --  a full set of HE ilvl 31 gear and a mod or two with +armor should hit this goal. With this, we can hit the armor cap of 4,700 (65% damage mitigation) by rolling a chestpiece with the talent Robust on it (+45% armor while in cover). With PvP's innate damage mitigation of 62%, the mere act of taking cover -- anywhere -- grants us the maximum of 87% mitigation, which is very solid by itself.

The second thing we need to do is try our best to hit 47% critical hit chance on our SMG, after mods and gear bonuses. Since SMG's have an innate ~25%, and you can stack up another ~23% with mods alone, this will come easy. Cirt chance on the gloves will help, and if you are lucky enough to roll Fierce on your SMG, then you might be able to amp your DPS by replacing a crit chance mag with something else. The key thing here is to meet but not exceed 47%. With this done, we need to roll Savage on our gloves. This will allow us to hit the 60% critical hit chance cap, and further exacerbate the tremendous advantage we'll have in cover.** This ability is great since many PvP players will rush you when they see you posted up in your cover, and give you a healthy damage boost against the shotgunners and heavies in PvE. Once you equip Savage gloves, you'll notice just how much combat takes place out of cover.

Other gear talents to consider, but aren't necessary:


Self-preserved on your SMG is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. It's not strictly necessary, but it is a huge compliment, especially in PvP. It heals us as a function of our DPS (which is further boosted by SC and perhaps Pulse), and our effective health is drastically inflated thanks to our mitigation. It's not too OP and the heals aren't amazing, but in a build like ours, the effective healing is a bit higher than it would be on other builds.


Rehabilitated is a glitched mask talent that, once activated with a status effect, will give us 2% of our health back every second indefinitely. This is absolutely not necessary at all, but it's an option if you want to be truly meta. Should and will be fixed soon, probably.


Steadfast is a nice holster talent for us, since we are a cover-based build. It allows regen to kick in twice as fast in cover.


Specialized is a backpack talent that marginally increases SP. It's weak as hell, but the backpack talents aren't all that great anyway. Inventive might be decent.

---

Abiltiies

So, you've no doubt hypothesized that because this build needs high Skill Power, it makes heavy use of and relies upon abilities to shine. If so, you're right. 

The crux of the build is Smart Cover, which with our high Skill Power, we can have 100% uptime. It gives us ~50-55% damage mitigation, and a ~40-45% base damage buff, which is HUGE. For PvE, run Smart Cover unmodded. Why? Recharger cuts the duration to 20s, which is too low to keep up indefinitely. Trapper cuts the damage resistance, which is a big feature we want. Concealment lowers it's range, which mean allies have a harder time using it, and it's buffs aren't particularly useful anyway in PvE. For PvP however, we definitely want Concealment. The range penalty does suck, but the effective damage mitigation of neutralizing other agents' pulses is very significant.** With SC up in PvP, our 87% mitigation is boosted to ~93.5%. , whilst in PvE, our mitigation goes from 65% to about ~82.5%. 

The second ability is more open, and can be used for a variety of things. Unmodded pulse is recommended ~~and can be kept very close to 100% uptime with Tech Support (2 kills = longer DUR than CD),~~ and provides us with a big damage boost (with S-P, that also translates to a healing boost). The mods aren't the best options, since two of them reduce the uptime significantly, and the third cuts the damage (and is redundant to Concealment, if used). Booster shot is also solid with a small damage and damage resistance(!) bonus.

The Signature ability can be whatever you prefer. Tactical Link is what I choose, since I have great mitigation already and it's a very solid damage boost. With our SP, the cooldown is roughly half of what the default cooldown is.

---

Talents

One is None is pretty much mandatory. Pretty big effective DPS boost.

~~Tech Support is great with Pulse, and basically allows 100% uptime.~~ Apparently does not work, see comments.

Critical Save stacks even moar mitigation.

Last talent is up to you. Do NOT use Combat Medic, it destroys Smart Cover. Tell allies to also NOT use Combat Medic. Combat Medic needs to be fixed.

---

Note

It is important to know that mitigation is based on a 0-100 scale... 0 being none and 100 being complete immunity. When you stack different types of mitigation, the bonus is applied to the remaining unmitigated damage. So, when you have 50% mitigation, you also have 50% unmitigated damage. When you stack something onto it, it cuts the remaining unmitigated damage. So if you have another, different type of 50% mitigation, it would cut that 50% damage into 25%. It is important to note that the Law of Diminishing Returns does NOT apply here. Even if you have 98%, stacking another 50% mitigation is still worth it, since it reduces a ex. 100 damage bullet from doing 2 damage to doing only 1, still making you twice as tanky. Thusly, stacking all sorts of mitigation is recommended**.

I feel like weapons are too accurate and stable out of cover, and too inaccurate and unstable in cover. I realize there is a talent for this but after testing it's not very noticeable and nowhere close to the same, in addition to being a short timer. This is what made GRO cover so important, and in a cover-based shooter, cover should be strongly recommended in any gunfight. Being in cover should represent a bigger advantage than protection, because I can just stand behind environment objects and get similar protection.

I also should be to lay down behind cover like you could in Ghost Recon Online. This made it much easier to position yourself to not get hit by suppressive fire. Right now, it's too easy to kill or get killed because some part of your body sticks a little too far out. Laying down helped prevent some of these situations in GRO.

If I'm behind cover and an enemy is at an angle where I can aim, shoot and kill them without peeking (more or less the ~180 degrees behind the cover), it shouldn't force me to peek when I do so and expose me to fire the cover should protect me from. I shouldn't have to blind fire in these situations.

Also, meleeing someone with the Ballistic Shield should knock them down like the Blitz did in GRO. This goes for enemies' shields too. It should be an ""oh fuckfuckfuck"" moment.

Pulse should outline the enemy like Oracle did. It makes it easier to spot enemies, and allows for more information.

Abilities in general feel underwhelming, coming from GRO. A well-timed ability defined an entire firefight, and the rock-paper-scissiors scheme they had was awesome. I'm kinda sad there is no AEGIS, Blackout, HEAT or even cloak (lolcloak). These abilities would be pretty cool in this game. They are a little OP, but it really made battles feel amazing and consequential.

Unrelated to GRO, but the DZ seems a little unbalanced. There needs to be way more incentive to PvP. Last night I was manhunted three times in a row and didn't get hardly anything for it. By the third manhunt, people just avoided me and my group of 3 all together. I also thing there should be more players in an instance, because it can feel barren at times. And some procs would be since (the purge idea elsewhere on this subreddit was sweet). Also some random objectives too... maybe a huge raid-level boss that spawns in that drops epic loot, or find-and-retrieve mission, or a hardpoint to capture, etc. I feel like the Dark Zone feels like a Dead Zone sometimes... I feel it should be more action-packed instead of kill easy mini-boss x3-4, open locked DZ chest, extract and repeat. Procs are always used by developers to spice things up, and that along with some intense PvP action would make grinding the DZ a lot of fun. Oh and those blue chests at level 30 and underground suck. Should be purple with 1 or 2% yellow (affected by scavenging, maybe).

Oh, and I love the game. I don't want to sound too unhappy or anything. Game is great, could be even better.

It's hard to enjoy the arcade style of gameplay in private matches, sometimes. Good shooters rarely miss open looks, fouls are not called enough, there isn't enough contact, and the general effetiveness of any given offensive maneuver is too damn high. The good and bad thing about this is that it can be changed so easily. Make it so we can change the difficulty, play style, and minutes just like we can in a regular game. At the very least, change it to Superstar/Simulation like Pro-am and high RTTP seeds. 

Number two problem is that RTTP past seed 1 has no rewards or reason to play. It's the only mode I enjoy, since it's real basketball (not guantlet, ugh), it's against real people (CPU is boring as hell), and always has a good population and no restrictions (unlike challenges). Just give me 5k MT or a VIP pack or something decent if I beat the first seed again (after receiving Ewing). It's sad that I have beat 
the first seed numerous times and have nothing to show for it. Don't even make enough MT per game to outpace the contract cost of my lineup by any significant margin. A cool idea would be a Stage analogue for MyTEAM that made wager matches a real thing, but that's probably an idea for 2k17 and not too viable to patch in to this years' game.

- Halftime sometimes hangs for too long

I really like the strategies he employs and am trying to build the ideal MyTEAM for it.

The first step is determining the ideal PG and C for pick-and-roll. Right now I have Stephen Curry and Anthony Davis at those two spots. Seems like a beastly combo, though I wonder if a faster slasher would be better.

The main problem is I'm having is coming up with a team that can play defense and rebound (at least defensively rebound) good enough to get stops and push the ball in transition, but also be a lights-out shooter to make sure the P&amp;R is as difficult to beat as possible.

Klay Thompson has been nearly perfect at SG, but the two forward positions have been hell to figure out. So far my thinking is to put Kawhi at the 4 and KD at the 3, so that KD can run the break. Defensively, I'd switch them around so Kawhi guards the elite perimeter player on the other team while KD hides on the weaker big. This would also give my team a backup plan in KD, in case the Steph/Davis action struggles. I was also looking at Dynamic Dirk and Dynamic Draymond, and even Ibaka and gold PG24. I also really like Porzingis, although he seems inconsistent as a shooter.

Not what I call ""corner-camping"" where you sit in some random corner of the map hoping some hapless chap comes along the way. But sitting on choke-points, heavily-trafficked areas, the objective or other meaningful hotspots. The best Call of Duty games I ever played were MW, WaW, and MW2. All three of which favored campers with 1-entrance buildings, limited routes and important overwatches. And claymores and bouncing betties, too. 

Not saying overly-campy maps are awesome, but I think recent games have become infatuated with flank routes, multi-directional entrances and now the recent addition of vertical access (plus wall-running). And now with BO3 and these ever-smaller maps, spawns flipping so often that you can't hold areas, it's actually harder to play strategically since the game so heavily favors highly-aggressive sprint-till-you-see-someone rushing styles. 

It's really hard to use snipers the way they were intended. You basically have to accept the quickscoping, mobile-sniping meta to be really good at sniping on a consistent, every-map basis.

I'm not saying BO3 is bad. I really like the game.  Gunplay is tight, progression is solid, balance is great and the movement system this year beats AW's OP verticality by a mile.

I also see the discussion between electric and ice and wonder how that factors into all of this. Ice adds onto armor which would boost Vex Armor exponentially, but as I understand it, you need to lose your shields to incoming damage to gain the armor bonus from Vex Armor. From what I've seen from other builds, the electric version of Elemental Ward instantly regenerates shields, meaning rotating in Elemental Ward after you cast Vex Armor effectively guarantees the maximum buff.

I also have a couple random questions loosely related to the subject, if anyone cares to answer:

1. Does Arcane Guardian proc off of base armor, or the armor you have at activation?

2. How effective is the bullet conversion/reflection from the electric/ice wards?

My current idea is to use a Vaykor Hek and Vaykor Marelok for the syndicate procs, and to invest in Arcane Guardian and Arcane Grace to up my tankiness. Along with a Rejuvenation aura and perhaps a Life Strike melee weapon in a pinch, I think this would be enough to give Chroma high survivability, right?

Decrease critical multiplier to 1.5.

Increase charge speed to 1.8.

The normal fire on the weapon charges up a homing rocket that guarantees a critical hit.

The alternative fire has no charge time and can be fired in rapid succession (3.0/s), but does not home in, and only deals 200 base damage. 

---

In comparison to the Tonkor, the charged shot does around 33% less damage and has an extremely slow charge speed, but you get a free mod slot and an awesome homing mechanism.

In comparison to the Penta, the alt-fire would have higher burst DPS but lower sustained DPS, and lack the ability to score headshots reliably like the Penta.

---

The two modes end up with similar burst DPS, with the primary fire being a very slow but much more accurate and ammo efficient way to sustain and take out a single-target or large group, whilst the alt-fire could be used on small groups and trash targets to save time  and affect a larger area on-demand.

The weapon would also have a lot of build variety.

---

The following build produces the highest sustained DPS on both weapons:

Base Damage and Multishot Mods (Hornet Strike, Barrel Diffusion, Lethal Torrent)

Critical Hit Mods (Primed Pistol Gambit, Target Cracker)

Elemental Damage Mods (Convulsion, Pathogen Rounds, Primed Heated Charge)

---

Vaykor Marelok achieves:

11506.103 TOTAL DAMAGE

36819.530 BURST DPS

23846.846 SUSTAINED DPS

Lex Prime achieves: 

15428.071 TOTAL DAMAGE

51838.319 BURST DPS

26367.405 SUSTAINED DPS

---

Just to avoid people telling me that the build is all wrong on the Vaykor Marelok, no matter what I tried on the Vaykor, this crit build outperformed anything else in terms of sustained DPS (which is more important in almost all situations), which was surprising to me. Go ahead and try it yourself -- you will get higher burst in certain builds but the cookie-cutter crit build achieves the highest sustained DPS without a doubt. Like it matters anyway, because the Lex completely destroys the Vaykor Marelok in burst on virtually every build.

And that's not the half of it. Critical hit weapons scale better into end-game because of headshots. The Lex Prime is enormously accurate and will do TREMENDOUS damage on headshots, and the damage gap will widen even more because of the base multiplier.

The only downside is status; the Lex Prime on the above build achieves 15% less status (55% vs. 70%) which isn't TOO significant. As a status weapon, the Vaykor Marelok is the clear winner thanks to it's high build flexibility and crazy base status chance, but in terms of end-game viability and damage, the Lex Prime is undoubtedly better. A 15% change in overall status chance isn't tremendously significant either considering everything else.

---

But /u/icysuspect, what about corrosive procs? 

The ideal corrosive-procing build (HS, BD, LT, 2x 90% ele, 2x 60% ele and PHC) feature about a 50% chance to proc corrosive at the expense of crit mods and 6k sustained DPS. This build hits Heavy Gunners for 40K DPS, while the Lex Prime will hit for 120K DPS (!!). You will need RNGesus on your side to get the procs to close that gap. That is until the Lex Prime user nails the guy in the head. Then the DPS gap is absolutely enormous and I'm not sure if procing every bullet in the Vaykor Marrlok's magazine will touch that number. The enemy would be most likely dead by the Lex by the time you get enough of armor down to deal more effective DPS anyway. Bring 1x CP? Lex Prime beats the Vaykor Marelok. Bring 4x CP? Lex Prime again.

Edit: Slotting in the two status elementals instead of one 90% and Prime Heated Charge puts the Lex Prime at 59K DPS against Heavy Gunners with a ~60% chance to proc corrosive. GG Vaykor Marelok.

Unless I am proven wrong (and by all means, do!), the Lex Prime is hands down the better weapon unless you want to have a blast status build and CC all the things instead of kill them.

The system fan is incredibly loud ALL THE TIME, worse than my old PS3. I think it is out of warranty, so I doubt Sony would help.

I want to be a tank first, but still be able to pull some respectable DPS, since many people seem to say that a tank who does some decent DPS is more valuable than one is min/max'd for only tanking. 

So my question to you guys is if its possible for ESO endgame, and should I do it? I'm an Imperial right now, and on first thought I'd go all my points and enchants on health, with an emphasis on damage mitigation and blocking buffs, like Deltia's build. I was wondering if I could go 22/20/20, and put food and racial passives to buff up my Health and Stamina.  Would still primarily tank and CC, but have the ability to apply some decent DPS when I want. I'm all ears for ideas or opinions. 

Again, mostly focused on the endgame, when I get to it (still a long way). I realize the majority of the game is balanced to allow for most builds to work to some degree, but I'm wondering how it would work in PVP or during those super hard VR dungeons and what not.",elderscrollsonline,Is an Imperial DK DPS/Tank hybrid viable for endgame?,http://www.reddit.com/r/elderscrollsonline/comments/3bur3s/is_an_imperial_dk_dpstank_hybrid_viable_for/

I was SO happy when Warframe added them, as it made a big difference.

I know you can respec skill points, but can you respec the Magicka/Stamina/Health? I just want to be 'endgame' when I reach the endgame and not feel like I have to remake my guy because of some mistake I made when I first got into ESO or along the way to my first max level character. I like all the different abilities and I'm not so sure if I want to be a healer or a DPS or a tank or some mixture of the 3 (or even all). All the different builds and stuff are dizzying and I don't want to shoehorn myself into a single playstyle. One reason I picked the Templar is because people said it was the most versatile class on top of being a really good healer (which I kinda like).
