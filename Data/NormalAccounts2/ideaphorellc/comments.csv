13,"Hi u/StanleyMitchelI. Just stumbled on this question - sorry i'm a bit late. This is exactly the problem we, a startup called [ideaphore](https://ideapho.re), are trying to solve. All the responses here are reasonable and sound. But they are based on old fashioned thinking. Open innovation (the process by which companies get ideas from outside the company) has been around for a long time and is growing very quickly since about 2003 (see [Open innovation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_innovation)). Some of the best ideas for new products and marketing have come from customers - from outside the company (if you have a TON of time, check out [Democratizing Innovation](http://web.mit.edu/evhippel/www/books/DI/DemocInn.pdf)). In particular, crowdsourced innovation is becoming a lynchpin in most big and small companies' R&amp;D processes. But they can't just open the door to everyone's ideas, there would be too many to review and to keep track of for intellectual property concerns. But companies do grow networks of trusted [Lead users](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_user). These are users that consistently give them good feedback. And they do often pay well for this type of input. You can build such an online portfolio of good clear feedback and ideas on our website ideaphore. You can submit some of your smaller ideas to show that you understand what a group of customers needs, participate in ideation contests, or win a chance to pitch companies directly. We help companies find people with big ideas by letting people submit smaller improvement ideas first in an ideation contest format. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHQbp6xUSSA) explains our concept. I would love to know what you think.

28,"Three words: Go stream yourselves.
    
    
There should be something streaming and available to everyone 24 hours a day. TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY. And it should be interesting. There should never be a situation where someone downloads your app for the first time and is met with a blank screen and a hope that some day someone will start streaming something maybe. And there should never be a situation where someone opens your app and can't immediately get something to watch. IMMEDIATELY. That's what killed color (the app). You'd open color and there would be nothing - no-one. It reinforced the feeling of loneliness that an app like that is supposed to alleviate. It's the equivalent of dead air on your new radio station. You just cannot ever have it. If you have to, you and your founding team should just livestream yourselves or your lives. And really, it flows naturally - look at these guys, they love livestreaming so much they are livestreaming their lives. It's something you can stop when you scale, but for now that's your hook. 
    
    
Here are some other ideas to stave off dead air: (1) set up cameras (with permission) at popular coffee shops so people can tell if they are crowded; (2) set up cameras (with permits) at some popular public places where interesting things happen; (3) set up a person with a drone with a camera somewhere so that people can find the operator, and ask them to fly the drone to a particular place within a reasonable distance and back; (4) set up traffic cameras; (5) see if you can license a live stream from space, like the ISS livestream.

37,"That is one way to earn points. We like to call them small ideas, as opposed to big ideas. Perhaps you have an idea for a charitable organization or you have ideas that you have found to be unpatentable after speaking with an attorney or patent agent. There are other ways to earn points, such as responding to specific ideation challenges, like on jumpstrtr. There, a specific problem will be posted for you to apply your inventive capabilities to solve.

&amp;nbsp;

Also, by lowering the cost of moving small ideas, we have created a liquid market for short creative thoughts. You can view or buy many other people's small ideas, pick the good ones, add to them, combine them, and resell them for a fixed fee. This is a practice as old as survey-taking and focus groups. But the problem with those is that they rarely find the creative customer when THAT customer is inspired. By reselling ideas, a member can become a trusted source of deep market research for companies. One of the biggest complaints we hear from large companies doing open innovation is that they have to look through 1000 ideas to get 1 possibly good one and they are often white-paper-length. We are giving people the opportunity to become masters in certain fields of industry by doing that work for them. This is another way the site can be used and there are many others.

&amp;nbsp;

Please know that we are just starting out - a tiny startup with big dreams about small ideas. We are still very lean and therefore also agile. We strongly believe in the open innovation model: the idea that lead consumers should have much more impact on the products they love during the development process and throughout the update and upgrade cycles. And we are capable of iterating on the web app quickly. Any input we get from our members will be strongly considered and we will adapt the intellectual property arrangements and tools available on the site based on what the community wants.",2015-08-30 19:48:01+00:00,cul1p4e,5,t1_cukz04r,4898,inventors
38,"Thanks for checking out the site and for the feedback. I very much appreciate the question and apologize for the long answer.

&amp;nbsp;

There are many other services that offer help patenting and marketing a patentable invention to companies. ideaphore is meant for that large spectrum of ideas that may have value if brought to the right company at the right time but that are not patentable inventions. Slogans, jokes for advertisements, incremental improvements to existing products, the idea to use tech from an expired patent, certain software ideas, the idea to partner with another company, something other companies do but this company hasn't considered, user interface improvements, content improvements, just bare - possibly crazy - ideas that the author isn't sure are viable but just might work, and many more. Or just ideas that you don't feel like working through to completion into a patent but would like for someone in the world to consider. For those ideas, there is no place you can go and say, ""I thought of it first, look I posted that on such and such date."" On ideaphore, you direct your idea to a specific company, person, or products that you think, based on your research, may benefit from it. And having posted the idea publicly, others can upvote it (we call that ""adding steam""). If enough people upvote your idea, it becomes difficult for companies to ignore. The company may contact you to work on the idea further and then you can negotiate further payment. But you leave anyone in the world the option of working on it without paying you. An idea that lives and dies in your notebook is of no value to anyone. But our services don't end there at all.

&amp;nbsp;

New ideaphore members can only post free ideas. Positive reviews from the community (and other participation like voting on other people's ideas) will raise your rank in the community. Members of the community that reach the first level will be able to post ideas for a fixed fee. For fixed price ideas, the last portion of the idea (the  ""idea is"" section) is hidden from the public and only those who pay the fixed fee can see it and use it (companies, and their competitors, consultants, market researchers). They choose the idea based on the public pitch and the idea author's profile. Level 1 members will usually have a ""field of specialty"" on their profile as well. A fixed price idea can be purchased an unlimited number of times. Again, companies can choose to work further with you, pay you to keep the idea confidential, or work on the idea without you leaving you free to keep selling it. Members who reach level 2 will be eligible for ""idea lease."" An idea lease is where the company pays a small fee to the author for exclusive confidential access to an idea for a limited period of time, 1 week, after which they have the option to buy it by paying more if they wish to continue using it or release it so you can take it to other companies. You can request that we offer other types of intellectual property arrangements for levels 3 and up.

&amp;nbsp;

We also have several upcoming related services that integrate with ideaphore. You can use your ideaphore profile and rank to gain advantages on those services. For instance, jumpstrtr is an upcoming crowdsourced innovation platform for startups. On jumpstrtr, startups (especially crowdfunded startups) can ask the crowd to help them solve a problem that is keeping them from getting the product to market on time. In return they offer prizes and perks for the top ideas. Prizes will include one time cash payouts, free products, limited edition product versions, product discounts, a other cool perks. A well ranked ideaphore profile will get you better visibility on jumpstrtr.

If your first 25 employees aren't on that page, then you've got bigger problems. As you mature into a big company, the founding team loses control of almost everything except the general direction and momentum. Paranoia will find its way into the company culture eventually. Important things have to change from the startup phase for a company to get big, including necessary secrecy and distance of the founders from the employees that was not there during the early stage.
