I am the organizer of a new meetup group in New York City. Most startup meetups have founders come in and tell their startup story. Those are great, I love those and attend them regularly. But I wanted to try something a little more hands on. At our meetups, the founders get the benefit of watching how people would encounter their product in the wild and play with them, each individual ""player"" can learn from everyone else what they look at and look for when they encounter new tech, and I get to meet awesome new people.
    
Our first meeting will be this coming Wednesday, October 7 in the Flatiron area. We will be testing three new apps. BYOD (bring your own devices to test apps on). We will meet every month. If anyone here has a new or upcoming product and is interested in presenting at a future meetup in NYC, let me know.
