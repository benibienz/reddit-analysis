1. For a good campus cruiser, get an old steel frame roadie off craigslist. It'll hold you fine and they aren't hard to find in 60 or 61cm. Fix it up to make it shiny. 

2. BD bikes aren't bad, but they're generally lower quality. You'll spend half as much on a bike twice as durable with the craigslist option. Besides, nothing says ""steal me"" quite like a brand new bike left outside for long periods.

77,"Even if you did by chance have an LSD in your rear diff, it shouldn't cause binding, simply from the nature of an LSD. They don't start to lock up until it detects slippage. Especially with the Vari-Lock, it only starts to lock up under high(er) wheel speed. IF you're driving it around normally, it should be smooth as butter. 

Unless the person you bought the truck from had some different ones installed, it is very likely that you do not have LSDs. They just did not put them in Laredos.

My new hubs did not come with new cotter pins for the axle nut. If you plan on reusing them (which I did), be sure not to bend and snap them taking them off. 

Mine is a NC truck. Despite being rust free, the hub itself was a real pain in the neck to get loose. I banged on it with a hammer for a while, but what worked much better was an air chisel. If you have access to one, I would highly suggest it.

117,"For the most part, bikes are going to fit into 3 main categories: Road, mountain and hybrid.

Road bikes are pretty self explanatory. If you want to go fast, look into these. Not advisable to take these off the road. Curved down handlebars, aggressive lean position for aerodynamics.

Mountain is pretty easy to guess at also. Wider, knobbier tires. More upright riding position than a road bike. Some come with suspension in the frame for more serious riding. 

Hybrid is a essentially a combination of the 2. Narrower tires closer to what you would find on a road bike. Most modern hybrids come with a front suspension. They are also a more upright riding position. 

There are a lot of exceptions to this basic overview, but for the most part, this is what you'll run into. 

If you're looking for something basic to cruise unpaved roads, take a look at a hard tail (only front suspension) mountain bike or a hybrid style with a bit larger tires.

This bike is a thing of beauty. Leather saddle, leather handlebar tape, all new cables, brake pads, chain, tires, tubes and a nice light. I took apart every component, cleaned and greased everything, reassembled and tuned everything. It is nicer than a Varsity ever would have been new. I spent somewhere in the neighborhood of $400 on this bike, not including the frame, wheels and handlebars (which I already had). 
This wanker of a girl, with the coordination of a butterfly in the wind, cannot handle this bike at all. Can't ride it straight, can't grasp the concept of friction shifters, doesn't know how to start and stop for lights or stop signs, she just doesn't have the capacity to handle a road bike. 

This is where it starts to get ranty. I spent HOURS on this goddam bike. I took apart numerous other bikes just to get some parts for it, spent WAAY more money on parts than the bike is worth and generally busted my ass to get this thing together for her. She isn't a cyclist in the least, and I know for a FACT that she will never ride this bike on her own. She's one of those fake hipsters who tells everybody their a hipster and posts hipster shit on FB, but is actually just pretty basic.

It's a gorgeous bike, it's in amazing shape and it rides great.

-Perform an Italian Tune-up (run up your RPMs to 4-5k for 30 seconds or so; blow some of the gunk out of the engine. This coupled with the fuel system cleaner could yield some nice results.)

$300 seems excessive for brakes. I'm assuming you mean taking it to a shop and getting rotors and pads changed? If that's the case, it might save you a bit of money if you order the parts yourself and just pay for labor.

Add some lighting. Either on the front bumper, A pillar or hood. Lighting is useful not matter what application. And you don't need to be on a trail at night to enjoy it.

Help your engine breathe with a new intake and perhaps some exhaust work.

If you have the 4.0, go up to a junkyard and grab some fuel injectors from a Ford 4.6. They plug right in and make your rig run a lot better. 

Get some foam pads to line your glove box with so you can store stuff in there without it rattling around. 

Stickers add 2-5 hp per, so head up to your local auto parts store and load up.

New head light lenses make the vehicle look like new. Look into some of those if you need to.

272,"WKjeeps.com Will offer you a lot of information on this generation. As I'm a WJ guy, I don't know whole lot about the WK's but from what I hear, most people tend to like them. For a 2010, the price seems reasonable to me, but do some research to make sure that's fair. 

Is it a 4WD? I'm assuming it being a Laredo that it has the 3.7L?",2015-07-01 11:44:13+00:00,csokyhz,1.0,t3_3bo6pm,56226,GrandCherokee

274,"I am fairly confident that you could run 31's with just the trimming, coupled with a 2.5"" lift, I don't think you would run into any issues if you went to a 32. Theoretically at least.

Edit: I just looked on WJJEEPS and it looks like the Overland came with the Up Country Suspension package, which means you might already have a 1"" lift. If you were to throw another 2"" up there, I doubt you would have any problems with 32's.",2015-06-24 19:34:02+00:00,cshenkn,5.0,t1_csh95cy,8035,GrandCherokee
275,"I did do it to mine, but I have a Laredo, so there are no fog lights or anything to cut out. I really like the look, but I imagine it looks better with tires bigger than my 245/75 Michelins. Let me know how it turns out for you!",2015-06-24 12:01:12+00:00,csgyf9y,3.0,t1_csg05m1,71943,GrandCherokee
276,You can look at the bottles the fluid comes in to see if it meets specifications (Match that MS number). Generally there will be at least one type at any auto parts place that will have stuff that works. I put non-MOPAR fluid in my WJ with no ill effects. I've heard that Valvoline makes an in-spec fluid. ,2015-06-24 11:57:08+00:00,csgycgn,1.0,t3_3avszi,49200,GrandCherokee
277,"That's gonna be a nice looking rig. Be sure to post some pics when you're done with it. 

I don't know if you've seen it before on the Jeep forums, but http://www.jeepforum.com/forum/f310/front-bumper-trim-1218779/index2.html is good bumper trimming style that looks tough with bigger tires, and gives you some much needed extra clearance.

278,"Another perk of the WJs is that you can find a lot of good used parts on the cheap through Craigslist, DaveysJeeps, U-pick yards (which would give you the practice of taking it off a junk vehicle before you did the process on your own)

There is nearly an endless supply of parts for Jeeps of that vintage.",2015-06-19 11:38:17+00:00,csbr1bi,1.0,t3_3abqs1,54627,GrandCherokee
