My neighbor has had this canoe sitting in the backyard for as many years as I've been living here (6 years). I've never really taken any serious interest in it until just recently. I've talked to him about it, and he told me that if I fixed it and sold it, I could keep the majority of the cash. My intention is to buy it from him as is and fix it up for personal use. However, about a year ago, a tree fell on the bottom of it (stored upside down) and put a nice sized hole in it. It's about 6"" in diameter and goes clear through it. These are my questions for you guys:

1. Would it be possible to repair the hole? I've been reading a lot about fiberglass repair and I understand you need to be able to attack it from both sides. With the ribs of the boat in the way like they are, is it feasible to make a satisfactory repair? 

2. Is it worth it? I've started to collect supplies for the repair, but before I spend a lot of $ on everything, should I just cut my losses and find something in better shape? It will need the rib by the hole repaired, the hole itself, two new seats (old ones are shredded and hanging), and I was going to refinish the entire hull because all of the paint is chipping and fading. 

3. Would the other boat in the pictures (the red one) be a better project? It seems to be in marginally better condition than the green one (no holes, seats intact). I would prefer to put the time into the green one, as it's a better looking boat, but I would love to hear some advice from you guys.

4. And finally, what would be a basic supplies list I need? I've got sand paper (36 grit) and acetone to clean up the hole and the area around it. As previously stated, I've been doing research on the topic so I understand I need some filler material and a resin of some sort as well as a mold spray. Are there any brands or specific materials you guys prefer? If I were to go about sanding and refinishing the rest of the hull, what sandpaper and paint should I use?  


Let me know if there is any other information about the boat that you need. I can take some measurements and get some better pictures if necessary.

It came with everything I thought I needed. Except for one small detail. The old CV had a rubber boot over the splined section of the shaft, as well as a boot for the joint itself. However, the new kit only comes with 1 boot. Looking online, it appears that one is supposed to strap the boot to the bottom of the joint, and then onto the top of the splined section, leaving the rest of the splined section (the area with the grease that slides into the rest of the shaft) exposed to contaminants.

Are there any XJ exclusive mods or parts that you guys would suggest? Or perhaps some threads you can direct me to for some inspiration? 

Some of my ideas were tow hooks, wheel offset spacers, good trail lights, or maybe some undercarriage armor.

He isn't picky about what it is, I feel like after he's been riding for a while he'll figure it out for himself and I can help him get a more purpose built bike. 

THAT BEING SAID, I want to build him something of a hybrid so he can kind of go anywhere and decide what he likes best. Because there is a lot of unpaved trails and dirt roads around our place, I figured I would get him something a little bit more aggressive, but not so much that it's terribly inefficient on road. 

I was thinking about perhaps an older Specialized, something with only front shocks, or even a solid frame. 

I wanted to get some input from some folks with more knowledge of mountain bikes. I'm a road bike guy, so it's a little foreign to me. I'm building this on a budget, so I want to keep it sub $200 if possible. ",bicycling,Budget mountain bike build,http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/3dekje/budget_mountain_bike_build/

My question to you fine folks: Does any one else have a 2/2.5 inch lift? If so, would you mind sharing some pictures? I want to see how it looks with just the slight height difference. Also, whats the biggest tire you've been able to fit? Mine is leveled 3/4"" and my bumper is cut already so I'm hoping to fit a 32"" Rubicon set on. Let me know if this has worked for you or not.
