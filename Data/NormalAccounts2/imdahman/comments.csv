Some poetic anecdote says that History is the story of people so why not try weaving more narrative into the game? 

Maybe instead of 'victories' these event chains usher in 'periods' or 'ages' (think Golden Age, Age of Enlightenment, Jurassic Period, etc - long passages of time); complete the pre-requisites in-game such as specif tech or owning specific words, etc which would lead to an event chain. If successful it begins a 'golden era' for your civilization and whatever that means - 30% increase in research or what have you... 

Maybe during an event chain a charismatic Leader appears calling for his homeworld to become independent... how do you deal with him? Martyr? Give in to demands? Maybe after years of struggle he becomes a rebel leader or pirate? 

I'm just spitballing here but I also think having characters in this game shouldn't be done that often. CK2 works so well because it's specifically about an individual and what they experience.

Recently they have changed their management model - to actually mirror how Disney/Marvel does it - so that an Exec or Execs oversee specific properties.

However, many on the board of directors didn't like his 'style' of management, as Leiweke is known for being bullheaded and making big changes to get a franchise on track. 

that's what he did hear. he attempted to shed a lot of pre-conceived notions and get things turned around. Leiweke is directly responsible for all of that. 

However, the encumbered on the MLSE board of directors didn't like it. They said that he was not being 'respectful to the traditions of MLSE', ie they wanted the status quo. For example, Leiweke told them they had to stop resting on the laurels of what the Leafs did 30 years ago and they needed to move forward. MLSE pushed back and refused to let him make the changes he wanted to the Leafs. I think there was even a story of Leiweke wanting to take down certain Leafs banners, but management telling emphatically no. 

this continued tension lead to them basically buying out Leiweke early and covering it under the guise of 'Leiweke always knew this was a limited time job and he already had plans to move to another franchise'. When it showed his changes were working big time for both basketball and soccer franchises, they couldn't justify his early exist so kept him on an additional year. 

MLSE has no reason to make changes because the Leafs bring in so much money. They want the status quo. Leiweke wanted them to get off their laurels and actively try to make a better product. So MLSE decided to let him go. ",2016-04-06 17:38:01+00:00,d1sdsx4,5.0,t1_d1sd60n,783.0,torontoraptors

1. Have a large, max size/players supported game

2. We would have a weekly, set time to play

3. We would get a list of all the people interested in this and then from week to week, we would select the players from that list to play in the game. 

4. It would be a rotating cast, and random every game. IE just because you played humans in week one doesn't mean you'll play humans in week 2. 

5. If the pool of players was too large, from week to week we would rotate players, and there would be a rule of ""guaranteed spot if you missed last week"" or something to ensure that everyone got a game in. 

So let say we have a pool of 10 players and the size of the game is 8: For week 1, it would be players 1-8 in the first game. In week 2, it would be 9-10, 1-6. Week 3: 7-10 and 1-4, etc, etc.

PS in the ME lore, Hanar scientists are working on a genetic adaptation but it is not near completion during the timeline of ME. 

EDIT: Dealing with epidemics can definitely be - and should be - a potential crisis event in the game. 

Actually, focusing your entire empire of combating a plauge/disease/contagion reminds me of the Phage from Star Trek Voyager. An entire race of people suffering from a genetic breakdown are forced to harvest organs from other species and replace their own in order to survive. 

EDIT 2: and going even further with it, it could be used as a type of policital currency. Just like tech can be traded, so too could medical tech be traded. Lets say you stumble upon a genetic modification that wipes out a disease for another alien race. You could use that as a bargaining chip during negotiations, or give it to them as good will, or withhold it and see what happens to your rep when the rest of the galaxy finds out.

I made the example earlier where the Mushroom people will vote for you, but only if you annex Lyra III, etc

* obviously mod something other than Presidential rotation. The ability to set Term length, and term limits (if any)

* have member planets vie for council positions - ie one planet is Secretary of Defense, another Planet secretary of Finance, etc. I'm thinking UN wherein the planet is an abstract of a person performing a council position.

Civilizations can and will progress between the ages, but it's a fairly slow process so you're not going to see a Bronze Age civilization work their way up to space technology within the span of a single game... on their own, at least. Technological Enlightenment does not move them up through the various ages, it's essentially a progress bar (with associated events). The time it takes depends on how advanced the primitives are.

I mean, I know there is at least an updated galaxy map that reflects the destruction of Romulus' Sun - and that's via the video game Star Trek Online. 

The map itself will simply reflect the territories and homeworld of mentioned aliens in ST, as well as locations like the Briar Patch, DS9, etc.

He tends to over-help, which can be problematic when he's guarding 3s that can shoot the 3, or stretch 4s, and he leaves his man giving a wide open look to them. 

and on offense, I think there are times when he tries to do too much on his own, and gets in these zones where he drives to the basket. When he's on, he's scoring and it's great, but when he's not... he continues to do it and it's like watching a bull in a china shop.

2782,"You should also know something about most Toronto sports fans: We're manic, and essentially only deal in extremes. Either we're expecting a championship, or any adversity makes us call for sweeping changes and getting rid of everyone and restarting. 

We're a large media market, and all the attention of the country gets put on our city - both by expectation, and by people having no choice since our media is SO saturated by 'what's happening in Toronto'. 

So yeah... you'll see a lot of hyperbole and 'mob mentality' depending on how we're doing... try to take it in stride :p ",2015-06-26 14:45:45+00:00,csjfnsp,2.0,t1_csiyp10,46110.0,torontoraptors

It's a shame it worked out this way, he just couldn't find a solid role with the addition of Lou-Will, and unfortunately he can't defend with those slow feet.
