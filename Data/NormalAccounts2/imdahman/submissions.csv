Even in other games such as CK2 or EUIV after an army suffers a defeat they rout and there's still some of the army left to eventually be rebuilt or absorbed into another army. 

In Stellaris it's all or nothing: Unless you decide yourself to warp out the AI will stick with it until you or them are wiped out. There is no routing, and there is no attrition. And the AI doesn't tend to attack multiple planets at once, usually opting for 1-3 doom stacks. 

Maybe the game needs routing, and some mechanics to simulate attrition? Maybe once the fleet is down to 30% it will try to retreat? maybe there's a relative damage % taken that could be used to signal a retreat or rout? Maybe more than 50% gap in fleet size?

I want it to lead to situations where the controllation nation - lets just say JAPAN for now - becomes increasingly influential and controlling... maybe even able to make trade or economic sanctions where they deal you much less of the essential oil.

4. Xenophobic - Do not allow another species to take a planet from you for 500 continuous years.

This is one of my pet peeves for the game. I love MyTeam and building up a fantasy team and I enjoy that I can create my own team branding (shoutouts to my created team the Toronto Northmen). 

The way you simply assign plays in the game just doesn't work for MyTeam. They need to reinvent the playcalling system or expand it to be more robust. 

My idea for MyTeam:

Allow us to create a custom playbook. By default players in MyTeam would default to their own respective teams style. ie if Paul George is assigned as ISO/3PT on the Pacers, then that's how he'll default on your MyTeam. So, whenever you get a player for the first time or add a player to a linep, he'll default to his values. Then, when you have them in your lineup you can adjust their playstyle and it'll stick - until you remove them from your lineup. 

Further to that, the plays you can choose for your custom playbook would come from the pool of available playbooks you have obtained from the game. So if you've only got a playbook from the Lakers via Domination then the only plays you'll have are from the Lakers. If you have Lakers &amp; Minnesota, then you'd choose from a pool of both teams plays. 

Personally, I also think its time to ditch the play style assign plays and allow us to assign a specific play to a specific player.

- Further to that, I have this wild idea for a mod in my head: A Buffy the Vampire Slayer mod. Jason would be replaced by Buffy and the counselors would be vampires/demons trying to avoid being Slayed by Buffy. 

2. Is there a push mechanic? 

- Are the counselors able to push each other? My thinking is that maybe you're trying to get away with a fellow counselor and then Jason shows up - your survival instincts kick in and you push the counselor so that Jason will kill them - and gameplay mechanics-wise maybe it gives you a temporary speed boost. Maybe we could even push Jason to cause him to briefly be disoriented and giving you a chance to get away? Of course this would have to be balanced.

Lean heavily into Batman's mantra of preying on criminal's superstitions and such. We could say that he works in secret and the only thing that exists for the general public is outlandish stories about a Bat-Man terrorizing criminals. 

Then, when he or any of the family show up, we can play up the reactions other heroes would have, and you'd get the classic surprise dialog ""You mean he's REAL?!"", ""Batman's a myth"" etc.

It's a Season 6 ep wherein the Dominion War is in full swing and Sisko, becoming so disillusioned with the loss of life, decides that the only way to win the war is to bring the Romulans in on their side. So with the help of Garak, they create an elaborate holographic recording where the Dominion are discussing the invasion of Romulus. 

Basically, this results in the Romulans entering the war and allying with the Federation/Klingons. Sisko used deceptive, espionage-like tactics in order to get a major player involved in the war, and I think if this could be captured somehow and doable in the game, that would be so incredible. 

And, there would be lots of opportunity to fail. In the actual ep itself, after Vreenak (Romulan Sisko meets to convince him of the recording) analyzes the recording he actually finds out it's a fake (It's a FAAAAAAKKKKKEEE!!!) and states he would reveal the vile deception to the entire Alpha Quadrant.... only to be blown up in his shuttle on his way home by Garak, and the resulting explosion - coupled with the damaged recording - is blamed on the Dominion, which brings the Romulans into the war.

Construction Ship

Science Ship

Corvette

Dreadnought

Question: Is each class limited to a single hull design? Does this mean that all classes of a ship will look exactly the same? Perhaps you'll be able to make another design to apply to a specific class? 

The reason I ask this is because I'm thinking ahead to things, and one thing that springs to mind is the ship designs in a Star Trek mod. There are DOZENS of hull designs for ships and I'd like to see them all in game. 

My idea (if it doesn't already function like this), or hope even is that you'll be able to make, save and assign several different hull designs to one specific class. Further to that, I'd like to have the option where when I make a new ship of a specific class and have a pool of hull designs, the game has settings where it'll randomly select a hull design from the pool for next ship, or to choose hull design gets built next.

So basically, again using my Star Trek mod idea, I could assign hull designs for a galaxy class, Constitution, Excelsior, Nebula, etc to the 'Dreadnought' class in the game, and hull designs like the Defiant, Akira, Steamrunner, Miranda, etc would be assigned to 'corvette' class.

If you know your lore, you know that the Hanar saved the Drell from their dying homeworld and transported them to the Hanar ocean homeworld. 

However, because the Drell had evolved on an arid, desert-like world, the only way they could tolerate living on the hanar's humid ocean world is via domed cities. 

This also lead to many Drell contracting Kepral's Syndrome - the result of cumulative, long-term exposure to a humid environment. 

This is the idea I want to transfer over to Stellaris. I want to settle my people on a planet, and i want there to be a possibility of an unforeseen side effect such as developing a specific disease afflicting only those settlers because of an incompatibility in the living environment. I also see it as another type of crisis to deal with and something that makes a lot of sense in a context like this.

I did just get some recent mods like the themed zones, and unlock all wonders.

Of course, I love the soundtrack, but now and again, I think it'd be fun to just tune into music on your HDD or some random list online and listen to that.

Does such a mod exist? Is it possible? ",Fallout,Does this mod already exist? Music streaming to your Pip boy,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/3b2pr8/does_this_mod_already_exist_music_streaming_to/
