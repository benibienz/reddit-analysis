10,"I see everyone pitching their ideas and contributing, i'd like to do the same.

Taking from other games and different concepts; I could see high level smithing as a way to fortify gear. Being able to add materials to armor, or weapons in order to boost the stats of that item.

Making the ore to do this untradable, and requiring ""x"" amount for each ""armor patch"". Armor patches would give a bonus to the equipment.

Having the equipment boost be tradable would make it so skillers could help put new ones into the market. Making the boost possibly degrade with the item, so a new one would be needed each time it ran out, keeping them relevant. Or making the ore very rare, like rune ore use to be in 2007/2008 days, where very few runite veins existed. So that you would have to work a little for these boosts once in a while.

Say level 50 mining+smithing you could get ore and make them into armor enhancers to boost rune gear to have stats of dragon. Maybe even include a seperate boost to make that rune set have a damage boost, Accuracy boost, Defence boost, or armor boost above what it normally would be. But only one type of armor patch can be used at a time.

Lvl 60 mining+smithing you could mine the ore to boost dragon gear to have the stats of barrows.

Eventually you would get all the way to t90 armor. Maybe making the armor patch give  tectonic/sirenic/malevolent only armor + increased damage boost. and t90 raids gear to have higher defense and health. 

tectonic/sirenic/malev armor patches would probably take the corresponding energy + the high level ore + high level smithing to produce. t90 tank armor would probably take a new raids material (that could be added to beast master+yakamaru)+ore+smithing levels to make. 

This model would mean every tier of mining+smithing would have a benefit to the exact gear you can make/fortify, making the resources both valuable and worth obtaining.

It would give incentive to do mining, and smithing. Would boost combat related armor/equipment and possible generate new sources of wealth for skillers.",2016-10-19 19:43:57+00:00,d8z76po,1,t3_58a5rv,23796,runescape

Drakan's medallion- needed for rots. only exception is max guild. if you have neither dont even try to get on a team. seriously.

Scrimshaws- from ports. the superior kind. If you make them yourself they are cheap and do a great job.

Dominion gloves- need to unlock these, but they are very good, and best in slot if you are in augmented gear. (doesn't work with void).

souls/reaper ammys- Souls is BiS for rago/rax(?preference)/raids. Reaper is BiS for nex/rots. So idk what u are going to be fighting, but yeah get whichever fits.

Ring of death- Pretty much needed any time you are wearing augmented gear.

Ring of vigour- learn to do vigour switches. 10% adren every time you ult. Pretty handy, as most basics only give you 8% i believe. so this is really nice.

68,"Most people struggle with p4 so i'll mostly be covering that phase. I recommend range for learners. As the extra range helps you really see what rax is doing. Melee is much more advanced and reaction intensive. 

***

##P1 

P1 is the basics for rax. Dish out dps, every 5 autos she uses a special attack; cleave, healing web, or cocoon. Use freedom/anticipate every 3-4th auto attack to avoid the specials. Then just dps as normal.

***

##P2

P2 is specifically focused on the path you took, top/middle/bottom. And will gain a corresponding mechanics. Top = minions spawn. Middle = one shot spider spawns. Bottom = darkness spawns. They also have different set ups. P2 top is generally the same. Kill rax, kill spiders, kill rax. P2 middle is different, you have you keep rax in the acid pool till she is 75% toxicity. Then walk her up the ramp till it breaks. P2 bottom is dealing with shadows + her charge ability. Recommend to watch a guide on this.

***

##P3

p3 is a mix of both open paths, Do dps during this phase, rotate freedom and anticipation as best you can, while dealing dps.

***

##P4

P4 is a bitch. That being said. It's all about staying calm. So the basics of p4 go like this:

***
##100k hp - 50k hp


rax is able to use special attacks; cleave/healingweb/cocoon web/rotation specials. Continue to rotate freedom + anticipation during this time because having to deal with specs and prayer flicking is difficult. Also keybind your prayer switch and anti/freedom to be close to each other, so you can focus on staying alive. let revo do deeps for you.

***
##50k-25k



This is time to prep for your SUB 25k hp (core!) part of p4. build to 100% adren and get ready to ult! Also get up to full hp, while continuing to prayer flick! (antic/freedom not needed at this time, specs are only 100-50k hp).


Get yourself ready for core. At 25k hp remaining (core released) raxi will drain 50% of your adrenaline. So right BEFORE that happens it's a good idea to either use deathswiftness at 30k hp remaining, or use unload at 27~k hp remaining. Both will do a great job of taking down her health a bit. If you used deathswiftness, afer 25k hp and adren drain, use an adren pot for fast thresholds!

***

##25k-0hp


Make sure to adren pot if you use DS (deathswiftness). Continue prayer flicking and be ready to move one tile, let revo do dps for you and focus on staying alive. Prayer flick and hover your mouse over 1 tile to any side of you. As soon as you see the core launching at you, click the ground, prayer flick once again and reclick back on rax!

both nox staff and ascensions are a great first choice. 

However (and this is MY OPINION)- range is easier to get into, even though there are not many differences. 

Mage is preferred for varago and rots.

But it will not allow you to do nex or legiones.

I personally use or used range at: raids, gwd1, gwd2 (sometimes), nex, rots, qbd, and even rago. 

Mage is preferred at rago for the detonate ability. And for rots because it has double aoe basics. (not including corruption).

73,"&gt; around 10-12 minutes

Most likely you aren't seeing an increase in kill time because you are the one messing up. Not your gear/weapons.

My personal experience, was almost always using the same weapons. Gradually I went from 12 minute kills to 9 minute kills to 8 and then to 6-7. Now with melee I get consistent 5 minute kills without tryharding. (did royal for my first 80 kills or so, at which point I had enough for a nox bow, nox for about 200 kills, then made scythe from about 300kc-700[current] )

It's all about your dps rotation. It's not enough to just upgrade your gear. You need to know rotations for maximum dps.

It's not enough to just ""death swiftness"" anytime. You need to focus. 


***

Ranged basics:

Frag shot &gt; Corruption &gt; snipe &gt; dazing/needle &gt; tuskas wrath &gt; Everything else (rest are pretty even) [binding, ricochet, sacrifice, piercing shot {worst}]

Frag shot does maximum damage if the target it's placed on is moving. Corruption deals 188% weapon damage over time. and snipe is roughly 219% weapon dmg (make sure to cast another ability after the shot is fired! If you just sit there, you waste dps). Tuska is 110% weapon damage. And the rest are 100% weapon dmg abilities. Piercing is 94%.

The goal is to use needle strike as much as possible as it's short cool down makes it an efficient tool for maximizing dps rotations

My personal rotation goes like&gt; Needle &gt; Bleed 1 [frag] &gt; bleed 2 [corruption] &gt; Needle (2nd time) &gt; snipe [cancel early] &gt; Tuska's wrath &gt; Needle (3rd time) &gt; Ricochet &gt; Piercing &gt; Needle (4th time) &gt; REPEAT

Till 100% adren.

Then Deathswiftness &gt; Needle &gt; Adren pot &gt; bleed 1 &gt; bleed 2 &gt; Snap &gt; rapid fire &gt; Needle &gt; Snipe &gt; Bombardment &gt; REPEAT Basic rotation till 2nd snapshot.

GWD1

For bosses, I recommend any gwd1 boss. These are easy enough and not that special. Just a few mechanics that are easy to get a hold of.


***
CORP

If you can find a duo partner get going with some corp. I've heard it can be an easy 5m per hour for each person. Which is honestly pretty nice considering with both teammates using chaotic spear it downs fairly quickly and is afk.


***
QBD

Next would be queen black dragon. QBD is an amazing source of money and resources (if you keep the potions!). Solo boss, that only get easier as you practice more. She has a couple mechanics that people can struggle with early on but she usually doesn't take much practice before you will be farming this ugly beast. She has good drops and great money per hour (consistent).

***

GWD2

I recommend getting a lance (t85) asap. This will allow you to camp twins fairly easily and make good profit. Very good profit once you have max rep and get the 100% drop rate increase. Seeing as how you aren't using t90s you might want a duo partner for vindicta. Good news is, duos here are easy to come by. You can find duos in reddit clan chat, pvming fc, boss school at almost all times of the day.

***

Nex

Get yourself some void asap. As it's pretty rare people will let you nex without it. (part of her machanics, she can fk up people if they aren't using void- on her 2nd phase). Using t80 might be tedious here but i'm sure you are not alone. It wouldn't be as good money as someone with t90s and void but i'm sure you'll manage. 

***

KK

Kalphite king is pretty decent, as drygores are 1/40 drop rate. You can find teams in casual kk fc, pvming fc, and boss school. Learn to tank and you will find teams fairly easily. Tank is nothing special, it just means you can't soul split, and have to dodge some extra specials, but they are pretty easy to dodge once you get the hang of it. 


***

RAX

K good, you have some pvm experience, now take on some real bosses. Yes I have rax at the bottom, yes rax is easy in max gear and t90s. Yes rax is easy with 200+ kc and so on.

But we're not talking about all that. Get your experience elsewhere, get use to mechanics and practice dps rotations. Once you have all those locked down, now go rax. 

***

Rots. 

Rots teams wont take you unless you have t90 and either void, or aug t80/90. Rots is by far the hardest on this list. And teams only look for efficiency. If your gear is lacking u probably wont make teams all that often as rots can be very difficult.

86,"&gt; When Araxxor gets below 50K immediately do Death Swiftness

Would disagree. He is in armadyl and with lower stats. Probably should use deathswiftness closer to 30k~hp. As this will give him more time with deathswiftness during the move difficult part. T80 splashes a lot and doesn't hit as hard for him to use DS at 50k. 

Best advice, would be to bring an adren pot for right after the adren drain. 


&gt; Don't stand too far away, ranged/mage hits get hit on you at the same time (ranged hit is slower). Try to stand like 2-3 spots away from Araxxor or something.

standing father away is better. I would recommend max distance with whatever weapon you are using. If you are max range distance with royal xbow you can let rax hit you twice before switching prayer. If you are in rax's face you will have to change prayer every auto she does.

&gt; Devotion, devotion, devotion. :)

Phase 4 is all about being able to react.

some tips i've learned

- Raxi changes her auto attack depending on what you are praying against. If you are max distance with your ascensions then you should be letting her do two auto attacks before you need to switch prayers. It's a great idea to keybind the prayer switch.

- Raxi has 3 parts to her on phase 4: at 50k hp / 100k hp she will become enraged, and no longer use special attacks. But her auto hits will deal more damage. It's a good idea to burst her to 50k hp. Use snapshot/rapid fire/ bombardment as soon as the phase starts. (Try to finish p3 with 100% adren.). Once you have used all three thresholds just rotate anticipation and freedom just as earlier phases.

- at 50k hp build back to 100% and around 30k hp use death swiftness. Once 25k hp left on raxi she will drain your adrenaline. So it's a good time to use an adren pot. If you are in death swiftness, and use adren pot after the adren drain you should be able to get to snap shot very quickly. and hopefully finish her off before core lands on you.",2016-07-24 20:49:11+00:00,d5p4jyr,2,t1_d5p2ohn,2926,runescape

This is a link to rs wiki that has detailed information about revolution. 

But I will give you the simple version-

Revolution will cast BASIC abilities for you. This is similar to legacy, but most the time these will hit a lot harder than legacy will. 

Casting BASIC abilities will give you adrenaline. Adrenaline is much like the special attack bar in OSRS. The key difference is special attack bar started at 100%, where as adrenaline starts from 0% and you have to build to 100%.

Thresholds- Are like the special attacks from your special attack bar in OSRS. I.E. Snapshot for example is like your magic shortbow spec. BUT- it can be used every time it's off cooldown for 15% adren (you have to have at least 50% adren in the first place to cast it however). 

100% adren abilities- These are much like your thresholds, but instead of instantly dishing out damage they usually give out one really powerful effect. (usually used to kill stronger/tougher enemies). ",2016-07-18 07:46:52+00:00,d5gkqyk,2,t1_d5gk3zs,2044,runescape

Rots is extreme difficult. This is not QBD, This is not nex, it's not kk. I would say rots is harder than vorago.  People with 1k+, 2k+ and 5k+ etc, still die constantly. 

You have to learn manual. I get laughed at by people trying to learn rots who only know revolution when i say this. YOU NEED TO LEARN MANUAL. DPS is everything at rots. it's literally a race to kill the brothers before they kill you. And they will certainly give it their best shot. If you are busy revo'ing and one or more of the six brother special attack near or on you, revo is dead and your deeps are dead, and you will fail the kill and you will be dead.


If you don't dps hard enough, and brother might spec, and you will probably die unless u have good reflexes.          
If you don't dps hard enough, the -currently- death  brothers will respawn and will rejoin the fight, and you will probably die.

I recommend void. People bash this these days as Augmented armors are better dps. BUT- you always have to use ring of death with augmented armor, which can add up quickly. 

Using void, a lot of the time you can just loot your grave, making each death free of cost. 

Void is essential for nex and kk. (unless on task for kk). Nex will literally mess u up without void on (just part of her mechanics). 

Its still decent at rots/ and my favorite on harder rotation at rago.

It's a hard grind to be sure, but it will be well worth it as it costs no gp and can be a great starting point for most of your bossing experiences.

Now what should you kill?

without void I would recommend - KBD, QBD, gwd1 / gwd2, corp.

With void I recommend - kk, nex, rago, rots.

Naturally it shines at nex. I usually use phase 1, and again on ice phase. P1 i build to 57% adren before nex is ready to fight, and start by using frag shot into reprisal + tendril combo. It hits like a truck.

- **God books-** insanely expensive. one god page can go as high as 3 mill!

- **Scrimshaws (non superior)-** Easily the best choice. but cost upwards of 2mill per scrimshaw, for 3 hours of use. that's an additional 660k per hour to add to your pvm/slayer gear costs.

- **Scrimshaw (superior)-** Best in slot, and free! However for many who pvm/slayer we do it often and frequently. Getting the ancient bone mission from ports happens maybe a few times a week. Each scrimshaw being 4 hours, it's a decent amount of coverage. But as myself, doing ports everyday with all the best crew/captains/upgrades, sometimes I can go WEEKS without one of these missions. 

- **Insignias-** Barbarian assult- enough said. 

- **Blood essences-** Currently they are the best cheap alternative for pocket slots. However, they have to be activated manually, as the passive effects are just not substantial enough to mention. It can be rather difficult to remember to activate them when you are in mid kill for higher level pvm bosses. 

As far as pocket slots go, the cheapest being non superior scrimshaws at a cost of 660k per hour to use. 

PVM is suppose to be about making money, why is everything so expensive?

Take rots for example (source: i'm nearly 1,300 kc there) As it's one of the better pvm methods of making consistent profit.

 If i make 9mill an hour at rots, but you have to factor in overloads/divine charges/scrimshaws/sarabrews/nihil/rocktails/adrenaline pots/ring of death repairs/portent of life.

I'm not really making 9 mill an hour. It's sad honestly. I'm probably not profiting anywhere near 9 mill an hour.  Costs are just too damn high!

Really depends on how many people take interest in these learning events.

&gt; MH ascension crossbow. + death lotus darts 

Is fine.

No seasinger's (i know i said t85).. but gwd2 t85 has t90 accuracy which is why I allow it. ports t85 is actually worse. Accuracy is king at rots. As of right now, you probably wont be using magic.

&gt; 5% sharpshooter aura

Is fine, a ranging scrimshaw will help.

&gt; void is my best bet

Yes.

to recap; if you are on my team you'll be using range. MH asc + off hand dart, and superior elite void. Ranging scrimshaw is nice, but not needed as it is rather expensive.",2016-06-29 17:42:05+00:00,d4su1ri,2,t1_d4slnpx,9919,runescape

It depends. Rots requires 4 people, 2 teams of 2. The most common team is two people of different combat styles; Example- one will use range and the other magic. This way you don't share bleeds, instead both can bleed as often as possible for better dps.

It's also worth noting if you are on the side with ahrim, once he is a 'aired' he will take 50% less damage from magic attacks. So in this case you better hope the ranged dps on the side is competent :)",2016-06-29 17:32:58+00:00,d4stl91,2,t1_d4sbppu,32568,runescape

Super elite void has accuracy and damage boost. Power armor only has damage. 

This was a reply to another person on this thread, but applies to this situation.


&gt; Accuracy is king at rots which is why I allow t85, which has t90 accuracy. Once a brother is dead, they will revive unless you kill another brother soon after. If you fail to kill the next brother all previously defeated ones will revive.
Even in t90, accuracy aura and nihil, I've had some really close calls with brothers about to revive. It's not always a matter of just straight dps- but some brothers have specials that make them invulnerable for a time. T80 just doesn't cut it in times like these.

Also; as far as learning goes, void is very cheap. You can easily get away with looting your grave and not having to pay death/use ring of death. Void allows you to die freely at rots, as getting your first couple kc can be very costly without it. I for one am very glad I learned in void.

221,"&gt; shitpost as a post that never should have been allowed to be posted

I don't see a reason why this should not be allowed.

&gt; 'Raging' isn't healthy

Raging is therapeutic. Ever stub your toe?-Let out a huge fbomb. It's oddly soothing. It's releasing pain, acknowledging a problem and saying it aloud. This is a known fact that rage therapy is a thing.

&gt; it's not good for your heart to be annoyed at things all the time

This is why you share. The whole point of the thread is to share, and release. Keeping it to yourself is how you build up anger and issues. If annoyed, share it, it is welcome here. Get it off ur chest and move on.

&gt; Bragging to me is even worse. I'm not religious, but even thousands of years ago they could tell you that vanity is bad. It's essentially asking for attention, and most of the time 'bragging' in a game generally means you are showing off how much extra time you have spent on the game, that's not impressive, it's kinda sad :'( I feel for those that deny themselves a normal healthy and social life in turn of playing 10-12 hours a day of Runescape.

I really don't care to address this man. Is this some kinda joke? - you are taking this shit way to seriously. Bragging is fine man. People do it all the time on a daily basis all around you. IRL and on RS. promotions, gf's, grades, school. RS, get a dye,pvm drop, skill goal. I mean literally the list goes on. There is nothing wrong with saying ""hi I'm ""so and so"" and I completed ""X"" "". It's cool, Again it's all welcome here.

On a side note. Your post is way too serious man talking ""bad for the heart"" ""vanity is bad""- dood, look at the comments lol. Most people are joking. It's not like we're all just rage heads. ""I HATE RAX, THAT IS ALL"" is a comment I see a lot. seriously, it's a joke dude lol. Man I say that all the time while fighting rax. It doesn't mean anything, but saying it here gets it off my chest :)

If you don't like this thread, downvote and move on. But i don't think ur getting the point that it's just for fun and not as serious as you are -.-",2016-06-11 07:37:41+00:00,d44oh7v,5,t1_d44nx2u,2613,runescape
222,"&gt; way to sink items

Yeah this is a big part of invention. But perks/more customization was the next logical step as an RPG MMO. Yeah a drain is a good point but it's not the ONLY reason for invention.

&gt; why should they make a way to get back your investment because you changed your mind

Uhm, because people change their minds all the time. Also new and better perks could still be released. Why not have a way to keep aftershock/precise if something new came along? I'm sure they'll still have uses even if not BiS. It would be nice to have access to them after. I mean i did ALREADY make them, I should OWN them.

My own personal problem, and the inspiration for raising this question was that: I'm looking to grind 120 invention and maybe more (current 118.) Now I'm using scythe @ airuts. I made myself some top notch exp grinding perks such as: enlightment2+efficient2, with a Scavenging2+looting combos. I can't put these on my scythe because they used some great components that I might not be getting again any time soon. I could put them on my scythe, but then i'd either need to destroy the gizmo's once I want to pvm, destroy the scythe and get a new one, or just keep two scythes around and cause presets to flip out every time I try to use melee.

Which got me thinking about future perks/changes/buffs/nerfs/etc. 

You are right. Change is hard, i'm asking for something that is not 100% necessary. But it's not really an evil suggestion. Some people might use it, some might not. But it'd be nice to have the option at least.

Having the item break and losing the augment was my first thought. It's definitely a viable solution that fits with other invention devices.

I kinda like the idea of trading off item exp for gizmo's though, it's a little less expensive and more forgiving. And trading ""X"" exp would show you have tested the gizmo's and are ready to make a change. While still providing anti-abuse.

226,"it wont get removed unless you destroy or disassemble the item is the point of the post.

As a high level pvm'er I am compelled to use these perks. The problem I see is this being a longevity issue, as well as short term. Imagine if new perks were released that trump these old ones. You think it's easy to just ""destroy"" my current gizmo that cost me 3m+ each? well it's not easy.

Right now there could be new perks on the horizon, or new combos released. It doesn't make sense to just destroy the current ones asap when new ones are released. Especially if they are expensive.

Right now I'm looking at my leveling perks. I used hella rare components making these gizmo's. But I can't put them on my nox- which is troubling. Because if I ever want to grind out past lvl120 inven I'll need to buy a new nox or destroy the exp gizmo's when I want to pvm, and replace the exp gizmo's when I want to grind exp.

for myself and maybe for others as well; It can be discouraging to use our best gizmo's in some cases. 

Why have these enhancements if not to use the best possible? instead i'm using cheap disposable perks when i have access to much better stuff.",2016-06-11 01:33:54+00:00,d44enex,2,t1_d44e8pt,721,runescape

Also revenge is king because it will most likely take 2 hits to kill enemies regardless of att/crit/att or spd/crit/att (in my experience, having tested soha/Julie and others on faimon hell). so that extra clear speed is amazing.

449,"MAV lvl 35 max base hp - 7,500                 
MAV lvl 40 max base hp - 10,215

To show how much better mav is at 6 stars than 5 star, i'll use one single 6 star hp rune;

7,500 x .63 = 4,725

10,215 x .63 = 6,435

From one rune along you have gains nearly 2,000 additional hitpoints, add in the base health difference @ 2,715

One rune + base difference is nearly 5,000 hit point difference, factor in a second rune + subs from 4 other runes, and you have a massive difference. 


Def also goes from 468 --&gt; 637 at lvl 35 vs 40. This is a pretty decent def base, very nice additional mitigation.",2016-03-18 18:16:21+00:00,d14siog,3,t1_d14qo6c,2597,summonerswar
450,"I have runed my spectra a very unique way, I think most people disagree with my build, but here it is-

Swift, Focus - HP/HP/ACC:  87% acc, 27,624 HP, 191 SPD, 1025 DEF (+388, subs only).

I use mine in ToaH floors 1-90. (maybe i could have pushed more than this, but i get lazy).

Dragons b10 - Verde, Vero, Bella, Spectra, Sig. Sub 3min kills.

Both his hp runes are 6 star and maxed, his slot 6 is only 5 star, but also maxed. the 1/3/5 are pretty sloppy, but i did get lucky with some amazing hp/def subs. 

I don't focus speed, like most people do- maybe it would help. But i'm unsure. I always, ALWAYS pair spectra with bernard/verde/mav for that wombo combo OP speed stat manipulation. I have never used spectra by him/her self. So i find speed on slot 2 is not needed because he should always be in this combo, and will get speed from other sources. This slot is much more useful with HP IMO.

451,"&gt; Bernard is much better than Spectra in toaN

Wut. You can not compare bernard and spectra. they both have VERY different roles.

I agree to an extent that bernard is more useful, as I would never recommend using spectra without an attack bar booster/speed buffer. BUT bernard CAN be used without a speed debuff.

BUT- BUT, the point of spectra is to give your team a speed boost + speed debuff on enemies. IT IS A WOMBO COMBO. Maybe not an insta kill kinda combo, but for long drawn out fights this combo is AMAZING. 

Spectra + speed buff/atb boost are how people achieve ToaH hard teams in which the enemy NEVER gets to attack, neither bernard or spectra could do this alone, they need each other.

This is why shannon + bernard can help clear giants b10- and all the way up to toan100 (was my first team). 

attack speed debuff and attack bar reduction are so rare in this game, spectra is literally the best in this role. As he does both, in AoE form. Some even say because it doesn't do damage, the move is typeless. I'm not 100% sure about this, but spectra does land either/both the debuff/atb reduction A LOT on water monsters in ToaH for me.",2016-03-18 17:53:51+00:00,d14rk55,3,t1_d14l68y,8936,summonerswar

people bring a sernic switch to tank ice/zaros, mostly zaros because that extra armor will help you cut back on food, which means more deeps. And for ice, cuz it's easier to come back from a prison with armor over keeping void on.

On blood you need the acc. for blood, run md (i usually right click)+Put on your ranged boots! ---&gt; start snipe towards the middle-ish of the siphon ---&gt; Onslaught. Try to hold onslaught as long as you can. Don't break early, don't break as soon as you get red.

If you really feel you wont get it with onslaught, just escape out, use a few autos, see what happens. If she siphons x2, no problem. Just run back md during her siphon ---&gt; start snipe again ---&gt;thresholds. 


If you get hit by the sacrifice you are fked. Escape will always be ready by the time she does sacrifice, make sure you are md during her siphons and at your back is enough room to get the full distance.

Don't escape the moment you get red'ed. if you do it too early she might run towards you and still get the heal. You actually want to wait a tick or two after you get red. I use revolution + que'ing. I usually let one last auto go before i escape.

600,"&gt; require you to use 2handers

They do not **require** anything. Honestly, most the barrows specs (minus guthans) are trash. You don't need any of them. You are free to use any weapons/daulwield/shield combo you would like.

You do not have to use the barrows weapon in any situation. (guthans you can keep the spear as a switch, but it is not **required**)

&gt;dual wield therefore more dps

Dual wield is decent but in both EOC and non EOC, dual wield and 2handers are both very close in terms of damage.

EOC- ranged/magic 2h/dual are almost identical. Melee 2h/dual have slight differences. &gt; Destroy threshhold vs Quake.

Destroy is amazing damage, this is true. But quake is very helpful in terms of usefulness as it lowers the enemy def, making it more ideal for team bossing, and the AoE for slayer. 

Off hand usually does a significant less amount of damage, this is to ensure dual wield and 2hing are even in dps. 

Non-EOC will find that luck&gt; 2h/dualwielding, so really it doesn't matter. But i think the general consensus was 2h are better cuz they allowed you to hit a lot harder. (but i could be wrong on this point)",2016-02-03 19:38:16+00:00,czmm7vt,3,t1_czmj5tr,4052,runescape
601,"&gt;Is it worth getting bandos for melee and barrows for magic/ranged?

GWD I.E. bando/armadyl/subj is power armor. So you get more offensive stats for your t70 armor.

Barrows items are more tanky, so you get more defensive stats for your t70 armor.

Most people will say power armor is the better choice in terms of slayer/low tier bossing.

But- barrows will get the job done as well. Just a bit slower, but might save you some food.

*** 

&gt;I was thinking that the melee barrows stats look awful vs. bandos even if it's a fair bit cheaper.

Barrows looks fine, you can always put a cosmetic over it anyways..  Not really a factor, next.

*** 

&gt; One last question: do you need to wield the weapon that comes with the set for the 'set bonus' or is it simply just the armour pieces only.

Yes. You need the weapon for the set effect, but if all you need is good defensive armor, you can wear barrows gear with a *different* weapon. You don't HAVE to have the barrows set effects. You will be fine without them honestly. This way you can use a good t80+ weapon with that good cheap t70 barrows armor.

The good thing about say, guthan's set, is.. If you are doing slayer or something, you can keep the armor on, and switch out the weapon when you get low.

Say your doing slayer, and you are starting to get low, just equip the spear for a few special procs to heal you up, then switch back to your main weapon.",2016-02-03 19:28:24+00:00,czmlrt9,1,t3_440u2e,7293,runescape

bars 5-8 are all personal, 5 is all my defensive stuff. 6 is food/prep, 7 is prayers and situational stuff, 8 is for my extra stuff (gear switch, heals/nips/etc.

608,"yeah but it's still a threshold. I don't know why using shatter in an ultimate adds to the idea that shatter is a basic. I feel these are two different points in this discussion. Fact remains that i still feel shards+shatter should be compared to other thresholds. 

yes, i'm not saying they shouldn't be used in conjunction with other abilities to create a better rotation. But i do feel cool downs should be a  factor in calculating maximum damage possible. When fighting a boss, it doesn't matter what hits harder in one hit, what matters is being able to do damage throughout the fight. 

If we are talking strictly training dummies, all your points are extremely valid and can easily be used/practiced. But in an actual fight I.E. raids/rots/rax/rago, I feel your points add less to this discussion as it's a little more complicated than stacking up shards, using in ultimate and winning. 

im not saying shards are bad, or shouldn't be used. I personally wouldn't of been able to start doing rax without shatter. And they are handy at pushback for rago. What I am saying is although your points and math are on game, the practicality of this discussion is lesser due to the fact it is not a ""basic ability"" and doesn't really apply to current bossing as it stands.",2016-01-30 19:38:30+00:00,czhtm4q,3,t1_czht0zh,1030,runescape
609,"I don't really feel it's fair to compare storm shards+shatter to basics. Shards are a basic, granted. But the fact that you have to use a threshold to active them does defeat the argument that they are in the basic category. 

Thus they should be compared to other thresholds, not basics.

It's also worth noting that it has a 30 second cool down. This is extremely long even for a ""basic"" attack. And the damage over time would be lower than if you were continuously using a different ability. Yes it is more damage per shard, but even piercing will add up to more damage over time if it can be used x10 by the time shard is used x2

Try a mix match of different AD's. Keep it the SAME all week and see which gets attacked more and how often it is beat. This will give you the best advice. 

(for the record, as of early Sunday morning my def has been attacked a total of: 56 times. 14 wins with a win 25% of: [Vero, Theo, Chasun, Chloe.])",2015-10-11 16:34:57+00:00,cvvwzja,4,t1_cvveqq2,51366,summonerswar

Focus these monsters to push dragons. I also have a giants team guide also. It depends if you need feel a stronger despair/swift runes, or you want violent/revenge. Also pushing giants b10, will give you a dragons b9 team. Pushing dragons b10 will be better runes, but giants b10 needs a separate team. 

Anyways, check out the full guide. You really just need to focus one thing. Either; Giants/dragons. Once you can do that, then you can push toa and arena. Make a goal, stick to it, and it will help you clear other content. None of this broad shit. 

&gt; ""dungeon{S} and toa""

706,"&gt;  I need help on getting past lvl 49 toa and a better arena score

Can you Dragon b10? Giant b10?

- if you answer no, to either/both of those: ARENA SHOULD NOT BE YOUR FOCUS.

&gt; Can't pass toa 50

- Most likely it is your runes. Toa floors 1-100 have been cleared with F2p monsters. Meaning you probably have all the right monsters, you just need runes. To fix this problem, see below.

I suggest you work on a dragons b10 team. Violent/focus/swift runes will not only help you push toa, but it will help you push arena as well.  Violent is one of the strongest runes in the game. 

pvp for you is a luxury. Rune your monsters to clear content, and the pvp will come. 

Pvp has never been my goal, It was giants b10, dragons b10, toa 100, toa hard 70. Now I have done all that, my monsters without any pvp preperation can climb to top 1,000 players on global. I am currently (as of saturday) rank 348 as of writing this message. Never once have I built a monster specifically for arena.

&gt; 106 CD

Hmm.. I'd go tanky despair unless you get better rage blade runes. You really need a MINIMUM of 75 or 80 crit chance on a rage blade. Also your CD is very very low. Slot 4 crit dmg rune is alone 80% crit damage bonus.. 

I think instead of trying to keep crit &amp; crit damage, you run him tank with some combination of hp/att/acc, hp/hp/hp, hp/hp/acc or hp/att/hp. Use him as utility + dots. Despair would be really good with one of these builds.

Here is where it depends on you.          
Vero, Dephloi, darion, Bernard, Verde.

I have to say, there was not a fight where i thought to myself ""man I wish I hadn't unruned my laika"".

In theory Laika is better. But as I was telling relaxurfine, I almost made it to guardian. I never skipped a monkey king or rit, **WHILE** using theo as my main damage. I never lost once. Not once.

Theoretically laika should be better in this situation, but it didn't turn out that way.

You also have to consider, theo is very very easy to get 100% crit on. My same runes that made laika 80% crit chance, make theo 100%, I even fit in more speed and attack (using mostly laika's runes, as i stripped my laika).

Theo gets 15% crit chance on awoken, and +15% as elemental advantage. Not to mention leader skill has 30~ something percent, I always forget what the number is. 

So even though laika is good, it's very hard to get 100%, and a DD with crit D on slot 4 who is not always landing crits can be an issue, especially up in guardian ranks. 


My point is, i used theo for wind monkey and beast monk fights, and it went well. Laika would work, but possibly not even as effectively as theo.",2015-10-02 05:19:18+00:00,cvlf0z0,3,t1_cvle7ry,2113,summonerswar

if you have theo, theo outshines laika in every way.

no glancing hits..  turn that into ... Always have elemental advantage *(+15% crit chance, +~20% all around dmg)*

chance to stun... turns into... On death, can't be killed. *(add a healer, and you practically get a second life!)*

dots on first skill = same

Damage increase according to dead allies.. Turns into.. x3 hits with 70% (EACH) to apply def break.

Laika can't fight water minions, makes it hard to kill certain units. Also fire, and water deal full or bonus damage to him, making him easily a target against heavy fire teams.

Theomars Is water requiring wind to see him as a target. Wind is not part of the meta, and one of the most rare elements to see in arena/gw. Yes you see water units, but you can just kill them. A bonus is that Fire units (top meta for AO) will not target theo. 


TL;DR: Theo is clearly better. If i had the chance I would take away all laika's devilmon (already took his runes away). If no Theo, build laika (you can always switch his runes over to theo on FRR day when you pull theo) , but don't devilmon, you will regret it.

I personally like the violent version, I hope to someday run both, a swift and violent verde. Both would have revenge offsets, just for kicks.

swift is great for dragons and toa

violent is great for pvp and toa",2015-09-01 00:43:49+00:00,cumhomu,1,t3_3j5jyi,1690,summonerswar
797,"&gt; Is there are reason we don't see them as often as Chloe?

speed comps. Chloe is the single best protection from speed AO teams.

Double lusen, Water pirate + AoE (with buffs), Kat + invincibility. All these comps rely on unleashing everything they have as quickly as possible. In most cases, immunity wouldn't stop them from wrecking your AD. It's actually the invincibility that deters these comps.

Speed comps usually run (leader), (buffer), (DD), (debuffer/ secondary DD)

because chloe wasted their buffs, and possibly even their own chloe shield, their low hp DD monsters will be easy targets, even for tanky AD's. Making it easy to punish them.

All i have to say, is well said. You kinda convinced me they should be the way they are.

However, I would like to add that your argument is focus on mid range players. I am in late game (imo). I can do giants &gt;2 minutes, dragons b10 &gt;3 minutes, toa 100 normal, and toa 70 hard (picked to stop here, toa hard puts me to sleep.. I might be able to climb higher). I can push to top 1,000 players on global. (maybe more if i bought wings)

I have 38 x 6 stars, and I honestly can not seem to force myself into upgrading my 1/3/5 slots. I like +12, and I have almost all of these runes at +12. But I see very little reason to go +15, unless i just feel like wasting mana.

Anyways, that is why i came to think +12 would be a good stopping point. It might be selfish, but ""EH"". I thought it was worth sharing, and more importantly, worth hearing other people's opinions on the topic.",2015-08-30 23:06:04+00:00,cul87jp,2,t1_cul5upe,4380,summonerswar

One praises him in arena at C3, like I said I use mine, but it's rare, and risky. A vero and chloe focusing him, will kill him. Any fire nat 5, if he glances or missed the kill, will kill him, easily 1 shot by any, perna, kumar, and so on. He is just so squishy.

Maybe if i had 90% crit on him, my opinion would change, but atm he is rather lack luster. Yes he has lots of potential, but you really have to build teams specifically around him, to protect him, or to allow him the support to kill everything, before they kill him.

It's just not something I've cared to commit to. 

I mean mine is Max skills, rage blade, decent speed and so on. His only area lacking is crit rate, but I usually pair him with sieq to compensate. - Yet I still have a hard time using him.

People would scam left and right.

How would runes on the monster work? - could you 'steal runes' - or essentially, lie about the runes, remove them, then trade the monster.

Would would you spend mana on a monster? like an auction house? No thanks. Nat 5's would be more than we could ever afford.

Mana packs are already very valuable, and most here on the reddit will say it's the most recommended pack. Why? -because powering up runes will allow you to clear content. YES RUNES, not nat 5's RUNES.

I don't really understand why you are trying to offend me. This is all my opinion. If you feel tyron is better than susano, that is fine, that is your opinion. Susano has helped me get to where I am a lot more than tyron has, this is a fact for me, and as such my opinion is susano is better.

Violent + Guard. Hp / Crit R / Hp (100 crit)               
Ahman has been a bit of a roller coaster for me. Early game I could't find runes for him. Later on, he got decent. Then he got great. he use to carry me all the way to Toa 100. He was on my Giants and dragons teams at some point. I use to use him in arena once in a while. Now I don't use him, ever. Once I put work into bella, picked up a chloe and chasun, it was over for poor Ahman. It almost hurts, knowing how much I struggled to get him to be good, but I don't regret our journey Ahman.

I love my bella. Bella has carried me into some higher level content. The defense break with the speed buff and a strong AoE heal. Bella is a force to reckon with. She puts in a lot of work, and with her cleanse is rather unique. I use to run her on almost every team I made. My giants/dragons, toa, Arena team.. All of them included bella. Now-days I have more options, but she use to be the one who covered all the bases I needed covered. She has such an amazing kit. highly recommended.

I just need dragon to drop them haha :3. I honestly can't wait to rune him though.. So many players love him. My only advice, would be work on him later in the game. He is mostly a pvp monster. I mean look at me, I cleared both b10's and toa 100, toa hard 70 without him. The light 'trio' is a lie. it's mostly just bella lol. Darion for pvp later. Ahman (now) never.

Orochi plus the Acasis HoH was my golden ticket to Giants b10, which was my first high content goal. Orochi was one of the first units I put a lot of effort into runing, skilling, and maxing. To this day, I find his stats hard to beat. I got crazy lucky with his subs, I think he only has one 5 star rune, the rest are all 6 stars. I put a lot of work into him, and he rewarded me for it. I was able to farm Giants b10 very quickly with this pair + shannon, bernard and bella. Orochi made it happen though. He really pushed me to where I am now. It's all about the runes here in SW.

Acasis with Orochi pushed me into giants b10 at such an early stage in the game. This combo was killer for arena, and for clearing bosses. They helped me in Toa, and Giants, Elemental dungeons and so on. They really did a lot for me.

Fatal + Blade. Att Crit D / Att (nooby set up.)             
I got Julien rather early on, and slapped some fatal runes on him since I was out of rage (still am) and had a high amount of fatals (still do).  I don't really know if he is still worth working on. But he definitely helped me early on. He helped me push ToA, elemental halls, HoH, and arena. He is a good unit, and will reward you if you put work into him, but there are better wind attackers imo. Lushen or any wind nat 5 will trump him.

- Shannon: ~now 0/10, ~then 10/10          
Maxed skills.             
Swift + Focus. Hp / Hp / Acc            
Let me explain my runes for a sec. Personally I loved this set up. Yes it lacks the despair, but she gets more turns in return, WITHOUT speed on slot 2. More turns &gt; Chance to stun, for shannon imo. I use to use Shannon everywhere. I ran her in Giants b10, Toa 1-100, and even in some arena. Shannon is a unit I recommend to new players, she has an amazing kit, literally every skill is advantageous, which is very rare for most monsters. She is a dungeon master, a raid leader and a loyal companion. Supports win games.

- Bernard: 8/10           
10/10 Giants, B10 9/10 ToA Normal + Hard, 4/10 Arena and GW       
Maxed skills.         
Swift + Focus. Speed / Hp / Hp        
Bernard will always be one of my favorite units. He carried me early and mid game to push content. I'm very happy with the work I put into him. He helped me climb and clear Giants b10, and toa. He is a king.

~

- Kat :~/10 {Currently working on her}         
Meh imo, without chloe.         
Skills are in progress, she will be maxed soon.        
I fused kat early on. I thought she could be a farmer, and a decent monster when combined with neal. I was wrong. She WORKS, but I didn't like the results I saw. So i stripped her of her runes, and she has sat in my storage for the longest time. Now I want to work on her. Now I may even fuse and Max two of them! (We'll see, LOL). I highly discourage you from fusing her without Chloe. She wont help you clear content, she is only for arena and GW. Once these two things are your goal, feel free to focus on kat. until then, work on other monsters!

- Teshar: 5/10           
10/10 Secret dungeons, 4/10 Farmer, 3/10 Arena + Gw, 10/10 Giants B10            
Maxed skills.               
Rage + Blade. Att / Crit D / Att               
Teshar is really just 'Meh'. He has the highest base attack in the game, which is kinda fun to know. But he doesn't deliver much. His base hp at lvl 40 max, is like 7,400~ something. It's on the same level as a 6 star shannon LOL. Even if I bring him vs Water AD's, he will get solo'ed by the enemy vero/ chasun / chloe. He is not fun to pvp with despite his high attack. However he has made a great addition to my giants b10 team. It really speeds up the runs!

- Chasun: 10/10                 
10/10 Dragons B10, 10/10 Giants B10, 10/10 ToA Normal + Hard, 10/10 Arena + Gw.                
Maxed skills.                 
Violent + Endure. Speed / Hp / Hp (100% res)              
Chasun is my goddess. She is on my dragons b10 team for consistant clears. She is on my Giants b10 team, my toa team(s) (nearly every floor) and my AD and my AO. She is so stupidly good. PUT EVERYTHING YOU CAN INTO HER AND SHE WILL REWARD YOU FOR IT. Treat this pretty lady well, she pushes content and pvp like no other monster in the game.

- Seara: 6/10            
10/10 Bomb team (mostly for fun), 10/10 Gw's. 0/10 Dungeons, ~/10 ToA (haven't used her in toa yet).               
Maxed skills.                
Fatal + Focus. Att / Att / Att                 
Seara completes my bomb team. She was the reason I ever 6'ed and worked on Jojo + malaka. I can honestly say it was worth it, since it restored my fun in arena since theomars was buffed. She is pretty great vs veromos, and in Gw flying solo. Her latest buff does give her a lot of killing potential. It's a lot of fun to work with. I'm glad I have one now :3 Thanks com2us.

- Briand 8/10      
8/10 Giants B10, 9/10 Dragons B10, 10/10 ToA Normal + hard, 8/10 Arena + Gw.               
No skill-ups.            
Despair + Endure. Hp / Hp / Def (place holder)         
Briand is the real deal as far as revive units go. He is tanky, his revive balances Hp, he has an AoE for making use of despair runes. He has some debuffs. I mean he just covers so much ground. I run him in my giants b10 team sometimes, my dragons team if I feel like going right &gt; boss, My toa teams, and he put in work for me in pvp. Solid all around unit. I can say he is worth working on for sure.

- Julie: 6/10 (lowbie- mid game unit, my first nat 4 star)            
Max skills.                
Unruned atm. early game she was fatal, then rage, recently I tried Vampire, but it's all meh.                 
Julie was my first nat 4 star, back when I was still F2P. She was a big deal for me. I thought she would farm faimon hell with 100% success, and down dungeons. This was not the case. She does pretty poor damage. And I don't really enjoy using her. Her damage is meh, her skills don't really do much (compared to say, Sig, tyron, soha, etc). I don't recommend her. I regret her, but she did put in a lot of work when I was F2P, so I give her some credit. 

~

- Sig: 10/10 (Arena, Gw, ToA, Dragons b10, Dungeons)             
Max skills.         
Rage + Blade. Att / Crit D / Att                    
Sig was my first natural 5 star. I pulled him from an event scroll when I hit 40. Getting a nat 5 was a big game changer. I was bummed when I realized he was fuse-able, but he has provided me so much that I can't be mad. I use him literally everywhere I can. I use to run him on giants b10, he was my AO, he carried me through dungeons. I mean Sig did a lot for me, and still does. I highly recommend sig, and maxing him. It's worth it. 10/10

~

- Tyron: 8/10 (Arena, Gw, Toa, Farmer)              
2nd skill is maxed.              
(currently) Despair + Blade. Speed / Crit D / Att.             
I really like Tyron, I think he is a great unit. I've always been conflicted as how to go about runing him. I have tried many different set ups, and I can figure out which one is my favorite. I am really hoping this speedy damage version of him goes well, but there is more testing to be done! I give him a 10/10 in respect to being very versatile. You can literally slap any runes on him, and he will be amazing. He certainly is a unique monster. 

~

- Rina: 0/10 (Previously my farmer.)                  
Max skills.             
Unruned atm.                        
Rina is a NOOB TRAP. Please don't work on her, or six her. She is not worth it. I use to farm aiden with her thinking I was cool for farming on hell mode. It took like 3-5 minutes. I would fall asleep before she finished a board. There are better tanks out there, better tank healers, and better units. FUCK RINA. One of my biggest regrets was 6'ing her.

~

- Megan: 7/10 (Arena, GW)  (Originally 6'ed for dragons b10. - was decent, now part of my bomb team)          
Max skills.                
Swift + Focus. Speed / Hp / Hp             
I 6'ed her trying to make a dragons b10 speed team. The speed team didn't have the success rate I was hoping for, so she was benched. Recently I started running her in arena with my bomb team, and in GW often. She really packs a bunch and the ATB fill is rather nice. I recommend her for players reaching their late game. I think she is a good unit, and definitely worth trying on a speed team. 

~

- Soha: 4/10 (Farmer, Gw, Arena)             
No maxed skills. -All are close though.               
Rage + Blade. Att / Crit D / Att            
I originally 6'ed Soha because I thought she would speed up my faimon hell farming. I personally don't like to fail. Even a 95% success rate is too low imo. My susano has never failed, to my knowledge. For her to have 100% success rate you need 80% crit rate as vampire + shield, and good speed. Maybe when I max her skills I will try rune'ing her again. But for now She'll stay rage/blade and will be my anti-chloe. IMO as rage blade, her damage is lacking. I personally think she is a noob trap, with high requirements. I personally don't recommend her. 

~

- Kona 7/10 (Previously DB10, Arena, GW, ToA)         
Maxed skills.              
Violent + Energy. Speed / Hp / Hp      
Kona is an amazing unit imo. I actually 6'ed kona AFTER I fused and 6'ed Vero. (suprising huh?) Kona is such a good unit imo. Kona can completely 0-100% fill your DD to full ATB. This is huge for slower high impact DD units. Take my sig for example, on rage blade, a little over 200% crit damage, with 90% crit rate. You better believe that kona buff is like a violent proc for my rage sig. Sig x2 + second hit having attack buff! It's like if the unit i'm attacking got hit by a car, then DIRECTLY after, a truck decides to also smash the monster. It's very rare an opponent will withstand x2 hits from sig. I can't wait for the day I get to try this on Theo (if it ever happens.) I can just imagine, Theo procs 3 violents, Kona resets his ATB, he procs 3 more times, THE DREAM. GG your team is dead. Anyways, my point is kona is really really good. 

~

- Kernodon: 2/10 (attempted to farm with him)              
Maxed skills.      
Violent + Guard. Def / Def / Def         
I know know Vampire works better than violent for farming.. Maybe someday i'll try rune'ing him again. But for now i'll just suffer in my mistake. I do highly recommend him for a faimon farmer. You'll get vampire def% runes, and he will make good use of them. As a nat 3, and a farm-able monster this is pretty good. 

~

- Susano: 10/10 (Farmer, Gw, Arena)       
Maxed skills.          
Vampire + Revenge. Speed / Att / Att           
Susano is my bread and butter for making new 6 stars. He has become my favorite farmer of all the ones i've tested. He is reasonably fast, with 100% success rate. His rune requirements are not all that hard to acquire. He works well in Arena and GW. And I have run him as a successful DD in DB10, just to test him out. I think susano is a good investment, I use him anytime I'm farming, and I highly recommend this unit. 

~

- Mikene: ~/10 Needs further testing since the update. (Gw, Arena, Toa, DB10)              
Revive is maxed.              
Violent + Blade. Def / Hp / Hp              
My Mikene is all sorts of messed up. I runed her so wrong. I definitely think despair/blade Hp, Crit rate, Hp would of been amazing. I plan to change her someday. I've been hunting for a 6 star slot 6 despair hp% rune for almost two months now.. No luck. I need one for Briand and mikene.. Till then, she is running this janky set.. I hope to see more use of her once I finish her despair set. 

~

- Malaka: 8/10 (Arena, ToA)          
Bomb is maxed.       
Fatal + Focus. Att / Att / Att        
'See Jojo'. I think Malaka is better than JoJo on her own, as she supplies debuffs and decent damage. Personally I still think bombers alone are rather lacking, but with an attack buff, or paired with another bomber or paired with seara or the fire pirate, they make nice teams! 10/10 on my bomb team, but Malaka only gets 8/10.

Hello everyone, I remember finding this thread: https://redd.it/2ujgik, And i enjoyed it a lot. It's rather old and I don't have a reddit ID to mention. But I enjoyed it so much, i'd like to share my own Review and regrets on my progression throughout Summoners War so far with you all.

###**3.) About me:**

As of right now I have 38 x 6 star units.                  
Proof: http://imgur.com/a/FC6Cf             

In this thread I will rank them all 0-10 (zero being I don't use or care for this unit, 10 being I highly recommend and love this unit).

I hope you enjoy :)

####**4.) (6 star) Fire units:**

- Arnold: 8/10 (Toa [hard], GW, Arena)             
3rd skill is maxed               
Despair + Energy x3 hp%            
Personally I have a huge bias for arnold. I miss the good ole' days when he was very viable. He deals true damage, awesome for toa, self sustaining, and with despair he can really present problems for your opponents. He is kinda lacking in the dungeon section of the game, but he is a great Toa/GW/arena monster. 8/10

~

- Verdehile: 10/10 (Dungeons, Dragons, Toa, Arena, GW)                       
max skilled. (even second skill- I know I goofed, plan to 6 a second one!)                 
Swift + Broken. Speed, crit chance, HP.               
Verdehile is an amazing unit. I have mine on swift, but I plan to 6 a second one and make him violent revenge. Swift secures dragons b10 for me. He is very viable on AD, and nets some wins. I use him once in a while on AO. He is commonly on my ToA team, and just works wonders. 10/10.

~

- Roaq: 9.5/10 (Farming, lowbie-arena)                    
Max skills.               
(currently) Vampire + Blade. Att / Crit chance / Att          
Roaq was my first farming unit. My first 6 star and the unit I used for most the game before I started to go P2P. He farmed faimon for me, he won me a ton of arena matches, and He got me to faimon hard. 20 second clear rates on faimon normal is no joke, and really helped me to push more 6 stars out.              
Currently I don't use him at all, but I can't ignore his presence in my journey. He did a lot of work for me. I hope to someday rune him with an amazing rage blade, or violent blade set and just pray to RNG for procs! haha. 9.5/10 

~              

- Sieq: 10/10 (arena only)                    
Max skills                    
Swift + Blade. Speed / Crit Damage / Att.              
Sieq is such an amazing unit later in the game. 30% crit RATE buff, attack buff, and his second skill totally destroys units. With his buff and def break he can easily 1 shot Brands/ Chasuns / and most every fire unit. He not only kills units, but he helps all my other units to one-shot my opponents. He is hella squishy, and need protection, or just buff and dies. But he works wonders in arena. Kat + chloe + sieq is such a powerful combo. Sieq + any attacker is powerful! haha. Just such a good unit. 10/10 (arena)

~

- Akia: (3/10) (Arena, Toa)                 
No skills maxed.            
Rage + Blade. Att / Crit D / Att                    
I 6'ed her a long time ago, hoping she could help push toa, and one shot chasun. Honestly I was disappointed. her damage is weak, and I never really got her doing the damage I had hoped from her. She has a good kit, and I think I will try again someday, but for now I just don't see it happening. 3/10.

~

- JoJo: 7/10 (Arena)            
No maxed skills.            
Fatal + Focus. Att / Att / Att                  
I am (now) the proud owner of Seara. (As you may know, I rejected her for a very long time.) Seara + jojo + malaka (with chloe/megan) have brought me great joy in arena. For a long time, I used the same hand full of units for arena. Now that I have this combo max lvl, with 2/4/6 all at +15, and 1/3/5 at +12, I really am enjoying this bomb team. Personally I give them a 10/10 to all 3, but that is only because I have Seara.            
I have a hard time fighting comps with chloe, but if the AD only has Vero, I can always beat it. Personally I give the 'combo' 10/10. But jojo gets 7/10. Bombs with attack buff are incredibly deadly, but by themselves it is rather weak. I look forward to testing him in ToA hard. 

~

- Baretta: 10/10 (Dungeons, ToA)             
Max skilled.                  
Despair + Focus. Speed / Hp / Hp                  
Baretta is my ToA king. He works wonders, Dots, Stunning, Att bar reductions. I mean he does a LOT. I also use to run him for Dragons b10. If you want to see the comp I used him in, please check out my guide linked below. 10/10.

~

- Laika: 5/10 (Arena, GW).            
Max skilled.               
Violent + Blade. Att / Crit D / Att.                 
When I got Laika I was pumped, 10/10 for sure. Dominated arena like it was easy mode. Now, it's not that I hate him, it's more like he doesn't live up to his competition, Theomars. I think Theomars does everything Laika does, but better.             
Both Violent. Check.            
Awoken bonus. Laika resistance (worst bonus for DD), Theo Crit Chance.                   
Passives. Laika can stun. Theo can shit on any element of his choice.                  
Second skill: Laika gets increased damage per dead ally. Theo gets a def break (AS A DD)....           
So yeah, I'm rather disappointed, he lost his 'uniqueness'. 5/10, probably lower. I plan to strip him of his runes if I ever get theo. 

~

- Chloe 10/10 (Arena, GW, Toa)              
Max skills.                
Swift + Endure. Speed / Hp / Hp.               
I mean she is chloe. 1 turn invincibility, 2 turn immunity, Strong heal. She disrupts combo's. sustains life, and so on. 10/10.    

~              

- Spectra: 10/10 DB10 | 10/10 ToA hard |           
Max skills.
Swift + Focus. Speed / Hp / Hp (235 speed, 25% accuracy!)            
Officially enabled me to speed farm Dragons b10. Carries me in toa hard, up to floor 70 on easy mode. Pretty awesome when paired with bernard / verdehile. I think he is an amazing unit, and happy I finally put work into him!       

~

- Tesarrion: 8/10 (Arena, GW)                
Max skills.             
Violent + Revenge. Speed / Hp / Hp                    
Tes is such a cool unit. He can disrupt enemy units, and increase the damage they take. He comes with a def break + oblivion. Not only do you lose HALF your TOTAL armor, but you also take +25% increased damage from all sources. That is pretty huge imo. I rank his as a tank, because I want him to revenge as much as possible, while my DD takes down your units. I think he is awesome, i'm glad I 6'ed and maxed him. 8/10.

909,"Your numbers are on point.  But between FmK BM and perna, you would need chloe or vero. Tyron could really mess that team up (except FmK, but still).  A good Theo could probably do a ton of damage and take out a unit right away (especially if fast). And say the water unit took out FmK right away. OP would be in trouble. The same goes for a chloe on the AO. 

Say Chloe blocks all their best skills ~ FmK armor break, BM 3rd and perna misses a turn. That def would be pretty vulnerable.

Again this is all theoretical of course. if OP has amazing runes and violents like crazy it would be GG.

I suppose more my point is; I think mix'ed AD's are better than mono. I think these monsters are amazing, and i'm super salty looking at OP's collection, but I *personally* think paired with other units would make a more solid def. [Maybe mono fire could carry him to guardian++. I don't honestly know]

Therefor, theoretically speaking, FmK has to be included if indeed OP wants mono fire.

Aiden and other maps past it, have stuns, and debuffs that can really slow you down. Also the monsters have a lot of hp.

Faimon hounds and inugami are low hp, and the only debuff is def break, which, is tough for lower players to deal with. But susano/any vampire user can deal with this threat.

Faimon normal, faimon hard, faimon hell. ALL FINE. Perfectly good choices for farming fodder/exp. In fact, anywhere you like to farm is acceptable. If anyone tells you otherwise, kindly inform them to ""fuck off"". 

there are great 2 star monsters. Wind yeti is an amazing healer, Shannon literally does everything a support should do (applies glancing, 2 turn slow debuff [super rare], and buffs att&amp;def!) Seriously, just because their stars are lower, does not mean they are bad. These units have amazing kits, and can really bring something to the team.

Essentially, if you use a friends rep to ""bus drive"" It does not absorb the exp as if you used your own monster. I will take this from my guide I posted a while back: 

**16.) Friend's Reps and you! Making the best out of x2 exp boosts!**

- So you just popped that x2 exp booster, and farming fodder. How can you make the most of this situation?        
Friends.     
Using a friend's rep will allow you to free up a slot in your team! The Rep does not take absorb any exp like your own bus driver will!            
Completing the map will give a set amount of exp, which is divided by however many units you bring.          
using simple numbers; let's say a clear gives 100 EXP. If you only have 1 unit, that 1 unit will get all 100 EXP.       
If you have two units each unit will get 50 Exp EACH. At 4 units, you will get 25 Exp Per monster.          
So if you use a friend's bus driver, it will free up a slot, even if you have the REP+3 of your fodder monsters the 3 monsters YOU own will get the 100 Exp. being 33.33 Exp each. VS. 25 Exp each with your own bus driver (not using a rep).

Your goals should be pve. Giants b10, Dragons b10, toa 100.

Giants will give you runes to be competetive and climb ranks, dragons will push you to even HIGHER ranks.

Toa 100 will enable you to get tons of chances at summoning amazing monsters and easily 800+ crystals a month!

Now 3 hp% 5 star runes vs 3 hp% 6 star runes is nearly 5,000 life. Which can be a big deal, but you can always level the rune to +15 and switch it out for a 6 star rune later! So no harm done :)

Obviously it's better to +15 6 star runes, but +15 5 star runes is honestly just fine :)

DO NOT +15 1/3/5 slots tho. Only the MAIN stat will increase, which doesn't help the subs. They are only flat stats and +15 wont serve you that well.

1/3/5 slots should be +12 at max, +9 is also just fine imo.",2015-07-29 20:21:27+00:00,ctkpf9t,2,t1_ctklc2k,5462,summonerswar
1039,"I'm not trying to argue but in my own opinion, I'd say water charger shark can clear faimon hell with rage+blade/ rage+revenge/ fatal+revenge. I have not yet built one, but I have reps and seen videos of him doing it (usually 1-1:15 minute clear rate). Which is also a nat 3 like copper :) Also susano is my personal favorite (and the one I use!) vamp+revenge faimon hell farmer, who is a fusion monster. While not as easy to get as a 3 star, he still is pretty easy to get.

I'll add in your comment about Tamor, I personally have little experience with it, but it is an amazing spot, and great to include for early game players. Thanks for the suggestion.

As far as my 'expert' comment goes, I have built Water lizardman, soha, julie, susano, all to 6 and tested various reps and rune builds all in order to find a best farmer for faimon hell :) this is the only reason I would say I am an expert in this area lol.

The characters are all very one-dimensional, you only need to know the basics. The plot is pathetic, and the metaphors they use to give the movie some 'edge' just make it weird, and to me, dull.


The movie is all about marketing- this is what got me interested, as marketing is all forms of psychology and understanding the brain of fellow human beings. Complex, deep, interesting, always expanding, I love this field.

However, this movie has so little to do with marketing or understanding the mind. The narrator explains every little thing, so there is no room to drawn conclusions or even think for yourself, it will just be described to you what is going on in the plot! 

If you want to see some weird shit, without needing a brain to analyze it all, this is a good movie for you.

If you like depth, the idea of plot twists, analyzing the events in the story, character building, and etc, this movie is not for you.",2015-07-27 01:35:40+00:00,ctha56b,1,t3_3ems33,74065,bestofnetflix

1148,"for general advice i'll go over comments from your swarfarm.

 I'd say keep fire barb for the exact reason you listed, though I know how much use he could be with zarioss around.

I don't think wind slyph is worth investing in, especially since you pulled lagarmon. Most people who have one at 6 regret it, and hardly use him (wind is not part of the meta in pvp)

Personally i'm not a fan of the samurai. I think they are kinda lack luster as units, but the light one looks kinda fun. I don't know, i'd keep. But I wouldn't work on till you are ready to push higher arena.

keep fire slyphid, att bar reduction is very strong in ToA.

water rak/ water kobol could both make very good water attackers (bombs do true damage [ignore def]) both can farm faimon hell which is pretty neat, can't hurt going 6 star on either of them.

I love Michelle's elongate, it's a very unique still, and amazing when combo'ed with the right units, i'd say keep. She could make an amazing wind tank for toa and rez unit for dragons b10. (safe team)

I fed my fairy queen, i have no regrets lol.

I ate all my light ninja's. I use orochi for giants (dots) and susano as a faimon hell farmer (easy to rune). but ninjas are pretty useless units. I think he could make for a good mono-light team, but it's meh. I'd say keep, but i don't recommend investing heavily in him.

Copper should be rage/def for late game nuking. But vampire for farming, def for early game arena. 

I don't think light inferno would be all that great. Looks like a solid rage/blade unit. But any attacker with rage/blade will be good.

Megan is kinda meh, really good early arena / combo with bombers. but she doesn't seem much use later on. I think once you start pushing fighter ranks it's more and more rare you will use her.

Theo on the other hand, already has elemental advantage, and even if I do manage to knock him down some, my laika is the last to move on my team generally, and afterwards the enemy units start to take their turns. 

because my laika is ~15k hp (violent blade att/critD/att) Units often focus him as the AI seems to be able to tell who is weakest in the bunch.

1322,"As someone with a lot of experience with rez units, i'd like to discuss a few things.

Mikene is not as great as people think, with lvl 40 awoken she doesn't even have 9,000 hp. She has 8,995. This is such a low base for any support unit. She needs very very good 6 star hp runes, and subs to keep her alive. If you insist on working on her crit, you better hope you get acc from subs, or just run despair.

She is good in the sense that despair, and a 5 turn rez CD. But her base, and spread out *required* stats make it very hard to use her efficiently. Also devilmon are required, or pulling more Undines (not wise to feed wind/fire unless multiple)

Michelle on the other hand, nearly 12,000 HP when lvl 40. I think its 11,700. Meaning 5 star hp runes, 2/4/6 will keep her afloat and still very tanky. Easy to build, easy to skill up, easy to rune. With her second skill being so unique, only 2 units in the game have this skill, her being one of them. 

Michelle's second skill combos with Bernard, Shannon, megan, acasis, literally every support unit, almost able to provide unlimited buffs (as the CD will refresh). Not only does it help you keep buffs, but it lowers enemy buffs! freakin' sweet. + a small heal :3",2015-07-13 04:09:54+00:00,ct1dr33,2,t1_ct1brce,4071,summonerswar

I wrote this a while back.

TLDR; Mikene is only so good, definitely not as great as people think she is. 

As someone with a lot of experience with rez units, I would tell you 6 michelle would never be a regret, I have both Briand and Mikene at 6, and I still want to level a michelle. Her second skill is great imo, and can combo nicely. Mikene is decent, but only provides cc, which doesn't really impact the boss any, so she ultimately has very little effect in dungeons. (not including ToA, she can really rock that shit)

Michelle's kit, and second skill bring so much more to a team than just cc. But that is my opinion.

Briand just brings a lot of debuffs, and a great revive. Without Briand, michelle &gt; mikene. ",2015-07-13 04:02:32+00:00,ct1djnj,1,t3_3d2z63,4419,summonerswar

Also let me break down the math for you. 6 star max rune for hp is 63%. a 5 star rune maxed is 51%. that is only a 12% difference. Most monsters have a base of 10,000-12,000 HP. That 12% is only going to be 1,200 hp - 1,440 hp. Which is not a huge deal. Instead of having 32,000 Hp, my chasun would have 29,120 hp.

When I first came on this Sub, I asked questions, I was downvoted.. I was told to look up my questions. And you know what? It works. Google, reddit search bar, and sometimes daily advice thread saved me.

Why should your post asking for help be so much more important than someone using the daily advice thread, that you take front page placing? Neither you or your question belong on there when there is a daily post dedicated to that. 

When people feel like helping out, they go there, to that thread.

The truth is, there is no right or wrong way to do things in this game. There are no rules on what you can and can't do. You gotta figure shit out for yourself. Who do you use? Good 6 them. Do you have a team that can clear ____? Try it! See where you fail and where you succeed!

13. each have respective roles: lag for pvp and pve stuff, tes for pvp, verde for dungeons (mostly), jamire for everything(ish),  and so on.. it depends on what you need.

14. i can't believe i'm even answering this list. like you have everything you need to be successful, perna laga, jamire, and so on.. you should stop thinking with your wallet and start doing some research and using your own intellect.

15. save undine, i love undines.

16. supports win games. especially in toa. If you don't use them, then feed them. They are not all that rare. 5 star is only a 5 star.

17. ................ she is an attacker, attackers don't have a lot of hp. Their base is only so high, so you have to work with what the monsters has. 

18. chloe chasun bella/darion perna. 

19. Have you seen talc's kit? do think he would benefit your team? do you need a water tank? -either of these, then yes.

20. OMG why are you trying to build 100 fucking monsters all at the same time. No, just no. Focus one thing at a time.. Not 100 different things. Barbs are both attackers, do you need a wind attacker? do you need a water attack? -yes, then build them. -No? then do not build them.. It's just not that hard.

and no problem dude. good luck, and with that team for giants I mentioned, you should hit a consistent 4 minute run. Very few fails, once they are all 6 and decently runed, you will see no fails, and even faster runs.

2. your gb10 team should look like: Eladriel, shannon, bernard, +1 wind attacker, +1 support. could be lushen/vero or lushen/chasun. (extension) one thing at a time. Pick and focus one thing, It will be overwhelming to try and make giants b10 ,dragons b10 + toa teams all at the same time. However Giants b10 team can be used to do dragons b9. please check out https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQlGSeGSKB9BhxbmxZKZy0Q. Nick here does everything from f2p line-ups and advanced SW stuff.

4. Yes, I have sig and tyron at 6, both have majorly different roles.  you will find out as soon as you start doing pvp, and higher level toa.

1600,"giants: Orochi (L), Lushen, shannon, bernard, acasis. Should speed up the runs. I imagine 2:30-4 minutes. pretty fast. I mean unless players have god runes, they usually don't push much further than that.

Dragons b10: Verde (L) [swift/blade; spd/critR/hp], hwa, kona, bella, briand(?). Dragons is hella tough, to make this 100% auto i think you could replace hwa for fire arch or even chloe. But most/all will have to be 6'ed. Should be 99.9% success though.

for toa my core units are: Ahman (takes #1 spot), Baretta (#2), bernard/verde (depends on who i feel like using), shannon/megan (same). 

for your situation, I'd say Jamire would probably take number one spot. and you should use chasun a lot as well (might replace ahman [?]). Anyways, if you have any questions or just want to chat we can talk as much as you'd like.
