Today i woke up to find my account had been locked.

I have two possible theories of what could have happened but no information was given via email or on my account messages as to why it was locked.

I recently started using vpn, and haven't found a decent server, so i imagine jagex could have locked my account due to suspicious activity - aka logging in from a bunch of different IP addresses.

OR

someone could have been on my account and gotten stuck at the authenticator.

Is there any way I could check which would be the reason behind me getting locked out?

By splitting everything I feel it will encourage more people to take on the role, while also being more fair all around.

*What I can offer*

- Rots sherpa, I provide a calm and stress free environment, I don't rage or get upset with my learners. I just really enjoy pvm, it's all i do. The more people who learn how to boss = more teams for me :)

- we'll be doing practice mode, as this allows you to enjoy and learn the fight without the extra pressure. With 3 learners, and a very difficult rotation -atm- I believe this is the best way to go about learning rots.

- I'll teach you the mechanics of the fight. How to avoid the brother's specials, and how to win.

- Will teach you how to dps, as is the most current way rots'ers will

___

Requirements-

*WEAPON- T85 weapon at the least. (range/mage only please)                        
*ARMOR- Have superior elite void OR t90 armor.           
*Augmented t80 or higher gear is also fine.        
*Drakan's medallion           
*Any level accuracy aura. Sharpshooter/Runic accuracy. Supreme being best.
*Access to overloads, and curses.             
*Downloaded teamspeak.

Side note: Please have about an hour to set aside for this boss. And come prepared to die a few times (don't worry we'll be in practice mode!)

This is the only way to get gizmo's back from an item they are installed on, other than just dismantling the item. Now, I have no idea why anyone would use this over dismantling the item, so I see no reason to keep it around. Maybe if the person was too lazy to level the item to lv8?..

***

Can we please get a way to return gizmo's without destroying the item?

___

With a single perks like precise5, aftershock3, biting3 that can all cost millions of gold to obtain, it would be great to have alternative ways to retrieve these perks without destroying the items. 

___

Invention is rather complicated and it's easy to make mistakes along the way without realizing they were mistakes at the time. One item I broke down was a chaotic staff I leveled to 7, and I wasted all the gizmo's I had put on it. I was in a hurry to hit level 99 and dismantled it before the item was of level to return gizmos. 

___

Solution: Make a gizmo siphon- Something to retrieve installed gizmo's by sacrificing ""X"" amount of weapon exp. An exchange so to speak. Say item lvl 9 = activates the siphon (if used on the item you wish to get the gizmo's back from). The item will go from lv9 back to lv1, and the gizmo's will be returned to you. 

This way no one has to break down their noxus scythe if they put Biting on the scythe thinking aftershock could be installed on armor pieces.

___

**TL;DR:** Not the biggest issue. But with a single perk costing millions of gold, I feel these should be better answers if someone makes a mistake along the road :)",runescape,Retrieving installed Gizmo's needs to be made easier.,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/4nj4rt/retrieving_installed_gizmos_needs_to_be_made/

**Intro:**               
Hello. I am Miggels (previously Archdruid). I have been playing runescape for a very long time, been off and on constantly. My first account was created roughly 12 years ago, and my main account now just hit it's 10 year cape not long ago.

**Reason for this post:**             
I was very nervous about getting into pvm, but it really has made runescape more enjoyable. There is a whole ton of things I can do every time i log in. Thanks to pvm i'm also wealthy enough to enjoy the game as I would like to, not just grinding the same things forever and ever till I can afford something nice. But to actually change things up, do different activities, activities that I enjoy. Most importantly I can help others to similar situations.

**Boss Kc:**      
 My current pvm kc is here: http://imgur.com/a/3rHxA I'm still a casual. I enjoy bossing but I don't go super hard at it. I'm also no elitist. I have only turned down a few people from pvming with me. I don't mind slow and steady kills, but i wont tolerate pk'ers (nex/kk), nor people refusing to listen even after the 100th time i've repeated something. 


***

**Bossing Recommendations:**          
GEAR- In terms of starting out. Superior elite void is a must, Overloads are a must, Curses are a must. t80 is ok, but if you can start with t90 weapons it will accelerate the process incredibly. skills being 85+ is decent, 90-98 is good, but 99 is best.

Bosses-        
**Qbd/gwd1** Very accessable, but very grindy. Most anyone can do with lvl 80 stats and gear. I recommend doing these asap, even gwd1 bosses are some decent money. Go with a friend or solo it if you can. Great way to start and can be very enjoyable. Qbd is easy 4m+ even if bad. Just do practice mode till you get comfortable and learn the mechanics. Then go ham and make dat cash.               
**KK**-  Not my favorite fight, mechanics are kinda shitty, but with a good team this boss can be very fun. Very accessable/noob friendly. I definitely consider kk to be leechable/welfared. You can use void, t80's and still get decent kills if you know the mechanics. Easy to start, just don't die to green or mage phase and you are good to go. Get 2 people as any tank/voke/dps and jump into the instance.             
**NEX**-  higher gear/level requirements. Good money, and exciting fight imo. Ranged only duo is pretty easy and straightforward. I strongly believe 2 people in void/t80's can get decent kills, it wont be as efficient as two people in void+t90's but you will survive with a few kills less per instance. There is a lot to learn but really once you understand the basics you can kill this boss semi-afkish.           
**RAX**-  DO IT. DO IT NOW. Rax is the best solo boss in my opinion, even if you only do 2 kills a day, even one kill a day, DO IT. Rax is amazing. I have sub 400 kc, 4 full legs, one of each hilt. I easily have made 10m+ per hour (MINIMUM)  not including non-nox items. Rax is the best money, and teaches you very good pvm techniques. Rush to learn rax, practice mode if needed, but DO PRACTICE. I don't care if you rax in pernix+t80's You really should be trying it :)    
**ROTS**- Extremely difficult, would not recommend for beginner pvmers. Rots has a lot of moving pieces, you definitely need to practice moving+casting abilities+eating all at the same time. (Full manual is best). Once you can do all those things at the same time, the maybe start learning the mechanics.        
**Rago:**- Unfortunately you will see very little vorago content from me. I'm not a big fan of this fight, and have yet to find any role I enjoy doing here. Dps is lame because only 1 dps'er will get the drop. I'm not quite good enough to roll as base tank/bomb tank for small teams, so it's just not interesting for me. i'm the best tl5 pk'er though. After all my practice counting attacks, I still can't fking count rago's attacks lol. Invite me to tl5 if you ever feel like pk'ing ur team.     

***

**My starting point**            
I barely got into pvm'ing around late October of 2015. I had 0 kc of every boss minus, sub 100 kc at gwd and qbd. I started out doing gwd1 (mostly kree), and qbd, I was using void/pernix with a royal cross bow. 
  

***

**Clan req (KK):**          
The first pvm clan I attempted to join declined me till i had 100 kc of a group boss, so I went to hunt the Kalphite King in 3/4 man groups.

This was the first actual group pvm I got, and I was terrible. My dps rotation was bad, and i was still struggling to stay alive lol. I used superior elite void + royal cross bow and a yak most the time. 100 kills then was a very challenging thing to do for me, Got no drygore drops in the hunt for kc, but I did get to join the clan. 100 Kc later, I was still absolute trash at kk haha.


**next step (NEX):**        
Once I was in the clan I pestered a lot of people about nex. I REALLY wanted to learn nex, despite being rather scared of the fight. Finally some hero picked me up and taught me ranged only duo. And i loved it. I must of done 1-3 hours of duo nex every day from that point on. I don't think I did any other bosses till around 300 kc at nex. 

**moving forward (RAX):**          
Around 300 nex kc is when I picked up the itch to try arraxor. Now I was terrified of rax. And with good reason! I must of died 20+ times before I got my first kill at rax. That is an absolute TON of onyx's to repair my Ring of Death. A lot of my nex profit was used here. I got my first 10 rax kills (2 days worth of rax) and picked up shatter/storm shards. This made my rax'ing 150% better. I was getting kills, consistent kills. I forgot what it was like to die to rax at that point. p4 became a joke. 10 shards = instant p4 enrage done. This was the key to my success and my first 100 kc at rax. (and getting my nox bow!)

**Improving (ALL):**         
With my nox bow, death lotus/ serenic/ pernix / void all available I now started getting into all sorts of trouble. I kk'ed again, I did SOLO nex, I did more rax and even tried rago! I was finally playing with people as somewhat equal. My gear was decent but my dps rotation was still shit lol. Now it was time to learn how to deeps. I started getting really competitive at duo nex; competing for the drop. I tried to out dps people at kk with only ranged. I improved on my rax timer and so on and so forth. Now I was getting somewhere, and the gold and items kept piling up.

**COMP CAPE (RAIDS):**          
I only had one comp cape requirement left. I had to kill the infamous Yakamaru. I begged teams to take me, attempted making my own teams, and watched guides every night. Raids was literally the hardest comp requirement for me. I spent days asking my clan, raid fc and others. But we always failed and the team would disband after 1 or 2 attempts. I realized my clan (noob friendly) was a ton of great pvm'ers. And they had their own teams for raids and rago and such. I never really got to attempt these bosses with them. So I took off and looked for another clan. Fortunately my current clan took me to raid with them and helped me comp for the first time :).

**Comp is nice, but what now? (ROTS):**           
I solo/duo'ed nex, continued killing rax, and did yaka every other day. The one boss I really wanted to start next was rise of the six. I really did enjoy barrows when it first came out, and now there is an amazing high lvl pvm profit machine of the old bros. So i tried it out. Rots is both the most fun and the most difficult boss in my opinion. Everything is all peaches and cream if karil is being walked properly, but if he gets to spec... The kill can turn into a shitstorm rather quickly. Thanks to the kind people at teachingrots fc and some clan members I hope to make this my first 1k kill count boss.  (making a TON of money in the process!) I highly recommend checking out the teachingrots forums to see if you meet the requirements. If you do, then please join. It's great fun, and gold.

***

**Now:**             
dozens of nex items, all unique nex item drops + dupes now. 4 Full legs, one eye, one fang and one web. Tons of t90 shields from rots (most the profit is from normal drops). All the codex abilities from raids (3 achto pieces.) And tons of other goodies not mentioned. I'm very happy with my bossing experience, and I hope to keep going and learning new bosses in the future.

#**THANK YOU**

Thank you for reading. I made this guide so hopefully nooby pvm'ers can ask questions and see what a casual has to say about bossing and each boss individually. 

I was very nervous starting out, I hated dying. But now I really enjoy this game a ton more, and it's all thanks to diving into pvm.

All splits will be shared at the end. I will write down all drops on my notepad and who was in the kill (will get loot even if you died).

Be prepared to die a few times. 

#Requirements:         
1. Teamspeak/ Mumble            
2. Decent stats, at least t80 weapons, (85+ preferred)             
3. Void armor (for easy switching). If not i'll show you a loadout for full inv gear switch.             
4. Must have a switch for melee and + 1 (range or magic)           
5. Decent familiar for food while learning.           
6. Full ancient ceremonial (to skip killcount) and frozen key.               
7. Overloads are important, Since she can drain stats            
8. Be prepared to die a few times.


#Inventory and gear: 

**my gear and inventory setup (as TANK)** http://imgur.com/a/4DfCC            
Replace ports with void if possible. Or if using nex gear, bring melee boots/gloves/helm and keep a ranged chest and leg switch.                     

The combination pots I use are: supreme overload, prayer renewal (buyable), and replenishment (adrenaline pot).

Keep in mind, the inventory does not have a lot of food, but my yak will be full of food.

Also I recommend an antipoison++ and Excalibur.


#Phases 

**1. Smoke**         
Melee gear and weapons preferred       
Pray mage         
2 special attacks.            
-A charge; (which shouldn't ever be a problem with me tanking, I lure her out of this attack's range)         
-A pull; She will pull you in and turn off your prayer, smack you in the face with melee hits. (HOW TO AVOID): keep anticipation and freedom active. (rotate between them). If she pulls you in, freedom to get out.

Kill minion.


**2. Shadow**            
Melee gear and weapons is a MUST (in trio)          
Pray Range          
1 Special attack            
-Shadows; A shadow will pop up under our feet. If you do not move away from the shadow the shadow will hit 3,000-5,000 HP. (HOW TO AVOID) Flicker your attacks, attack her (use one ability) and run a tile or two back. Then hit her again. Watch for shadows and if you are flickering and one pops up, rotate around nex to a different angle.

kill minion.

**3. Blood**      
Melee or Range/Magic gear and weapons.             
Pray mage              
NO BLEEDS AT ALL (she will heal ALL damage from bleeds at any time during this phase).        
2 special attacks             
-Sacrifice; she will turn someone red *text will be above her head* if you are red, you need to move 6-7 tiles away from nex. If not you will be dealt 1,000 damage, and Nex will heal the damage you took. (HOW TO AVOID) Run 6-7 tiles away from nex. Use surge or escape to get distance quickly.

Kill minion.

**4. Ice**           
Ranged/Magic gear and weapons preferred             
Prayer mage                  
2 special attacks.             
-Prison; She will call out *die now in a prison of ice*. an ice box will appear around the tank (me) and she will deal 6,000-7,800 damage to me. (HOW TO HELP ME) spam click the icicles that the will all around me, pick one and spam the shit out of it, and if it breaks I wont take any damage. HOWEVER I will be using barricade or immortality regardless of if you break the ice. But it's good practice and in case I mess up, it can save my life!             
-Contain this!; Nex will yell out *contain this!* and make icicles around her feet (both sides of her). If you get caught in this attack, she will deal 3,000-4,000 HP and turn off your prayer. (HOW TO AVOID) Watch which way she is walking as the text pops up over her head, and walk the opposite direction. Surge and escape are fantastic for this part.

Kill minion.

**5. Zaros**         
Range or magic gear and weapons preferred. be prepared to switch!
Pray mage    
You need to space yourself a couple tiles away from nex)
She can switch her prayers during this phase.       
Reflect magic             
Reflect range           
Reflect melee             
Make sure you change your weapons if she is reflecting damage at you.            
She has a splash hit, this is why you need to stand away from her. If she is attacking me, but you are behind her in melee distance, you will get hit as well.



#TL;DR
Smoke- rotate freedom and anticipation - kill minion.        

  
Shadow- WATCH YOUR FEET, more than dps, more than killing nex or minion, WATCH YOUR FEET - kill minion.          
*SHADOW IS THE ONLY TIME DPS can get killed very easily*         

   
Blood- She heals a LOT. - kill minion.            


Ice- TRY TO FREE ME PLEASE - kill minion.

##**4.) Water units:**               


- **Julie:** 6/10 (lowbie- mid game unit, my first nat 4 star)       
10/10 Mid game unit, 4/10 late game unit, 0/10 Dungeons, 0/10 Giants and Dragons B10, 0/10 Toa, 6/10 PvP              
Max skills.                
Unruned atm. early game she was fatal, then rage, recently I tried Vampire, but it's all meh.                 
Julie was my first nat 4 star, back when I was still F2P. She was a big deal for me. I thought she would farm faimon hell with 100% success, and down dungeons. This was not the case. She does pretty poor damage. And I don't really enjoy using her. Her damage is meh, her skills don't really do much (compared to say, Sig, tyron, soha, etc). I don't recommend her. I regret her, but she did put in a lot of work when I was F2P, so I give her some credit. 


- **Sig:** 10/10 (Arena, Gw, ToA, Dragons b10, Dungeons)        
10/10 Giants and Dragons B10, 10/10 ToA, 10/10 PvP            
Max skills.         
Rage + Blade. Att / Crit D / Att                    
Sig was my first natural 5 star. I pulled him from an event scroll when I hit 40. Getting a nat 5 was a big game changer. I was bummed when I realized he was fuse-able, but he has provided me so much that I can't be mad. I use him literally everywhere I can. I use to run him on giants b10, he was my AO, he carried me through dungeons. I mean Sig did a lot for me, and still does. I highly recommend sig, and maxing him. It's worth it. 10/10


- **Tyron:** 8/10      
10/10 Farmer, 8/10 PvP, 8/10 ToA, 0/10 Giants and Dragon's B10.               
2nd skill is maxed.              
(currently) Despair + Blade. Speed / Crit D / Att.             
I really like Tyron, I think he is a great unit. I've always been conflicted as how to go about runing him. I have tried many different set ups, and I can figure out which one is my favorite. I am really hoping this speedy damage version of him goes well, but there is more testing to be done! I give him a 10/10 in respect to being very versatile. You can literally slap any runes on him, and he will be amazing. He certainly is a unique monster. 


- **Rina: 0/10** (Previously my farmer.)        
0/10 Everything.                          
Max skills.             
Unruned atm.                        
Rina is a NOOB TRAP. Please don't work on her, or six her. She is not worth it. I use to farm aiden with her thinking I was cool for farming on hell mode. It took like 3-5 minutes. I would fall asleep before she finished a board. There are better tanks out there, better tank healers, and better units. FUCK RINA. One of my biggest regrets was 6'ing her.


- **Megan:** 7/10 (Arena, GW)  (Originally 6'ed for dragons b10. - was decent, now part of my bomb team)         
8/10 Dragon's B10, 9/10 Bomb team (pvp), ~/10 other content                     
Max skills.                
Swift + Focus. Speed / Hp / Hp             
I 6'ed her trying to make a dragons b10 speed team. The speed team didn't have the success rate I was hoping for, so she was benched. Recently I started running her in arena with my bomb team, and in GW often. She really packs a bunch and the ATB fill is rather nice. I recommend her for players reaching their late game. I think she is a good unit, and definitely worth trying on a speed team. 


- **Soha:** 4/10 (Farmer, Gw, Arena)          
8/10 Farmer, 2/10 Gw's, 4/10 Arena, 5/10 Giants and Dragon's B10.              
No maxed skills. -All are close though.               
Rage + Blade. Att / Crit D / Att            
I originally 6'ed Soha because I thought she would speed up my faimon hell farming. I personally don't like to fail. Even a 95% success rate is too low imo. My susano has never failed, to my knowledge. For her to have 100% success rate you need 80% crit rate as vampire + shield, and good speed. Maybe when I max her skills I will try rune'ing her again. But for now She'll stay rage/blade and will be my anti-chloe. IMO as rage blade, her damage is lacking. I personally think she is a noob trap, with high requirements. I personally don't recommend her. 



- **Kona:** 7/10 (Previously DB10, Arena, GW, ToA)         
Maxed skills.              
Violent + Energy. Speed / Hp / Hp      
Kona is an amazing unit imo. I actually 6'ed kona AFTER I fused and 6'ed Vero. (suprising huh?) Kona is such a good unit imo. Kona can completely 0-100% fill your DD to full ATB. This is huge for slower high impact DD units. Take my sig for example, on rage blade, a little over 200% crit damage, with 90% crit rate. You better believe that kona buff is like a violent proc for my rage sig. Sig x2 + second hit having attack buff! It's like if the unit i'm attacking got hit by a car, then DIRECTLY after, a truck decides to also smash the monster. It's very rare an opponent will withstand x2 hits from sig. I can't wait for the day I get to try this on Theo (if it ever happens.) I can just imagine, Theo procs 3 violents, Kona resets his ATB, he procs 3 more times, THE DREAM. GG your team is dead. Anyways, my point is kona is really really good. 


- **Kernodon:** 2/10 (attempted to farm with him)              
Maxed skills.      
Violent + Guard. Def / Def / Def         
I know know Vampire works better than violent for farming.. Maybe someday i'll try rune'ing him again. But for now i'll just suffer in my mistake. I do highly recommend him for a faimon farmer. You'll get vampire def% runes, and he will make good use of them. As a nat 3, and a farm-able monster this is pretty good. 


- **Susano:** 10/10 (Farmer, Gw, Arena)       
Maxed skills.          
Vampire + Revenge. Speed / Att / Att           
Susano is my bread and butter for making new 6 stars. He has become my favorite farmer of all the ones i've tested. He is reasonably fast, with 100% success rate. His rune requirements are not all that hard to acquire. He works well in Arena and GW. And I have run him as a successful DD in DB10, just to test him out. I think susano is a good investment, I use him anytime I'm farming, and I highly recommend this unit. 


- **Mikene:** ~/10 Needs further testing since the update. (Gw, Arena, Toa, DB10)              
Revive is maxed.              
Violent + Blade. Def / Hp / Hp              
My Mikene is all sorts of messed up. I runed her so wrong. I definitely think despair/blade Hp, Crit rate, Hp would of been amazing. I plan to change her someday. I've been hunting for a 6 star slot 6 despair hp% rune for almost two months now.. No luck. I need one for Briand and mikene.. Till then, she is running this janky set.. I hope to see more use of her once I finish her despair set. 


- **Malaka:** 8/10 (Arena, ToA)          
Bomb is maxed.       
Fatal + Focus. Att / Att / Att        
'See Jojo'. I think Malaka is better than JoJo on her own, as she supplies debuffs and decent damage. Personally I still think bombers alone are rather lacking, but with an attack buff, or paired with another bomber or paired with seara or the fire pirate, they make nice teams! 10/10 on my bomb team, but Malaka only gets 8/10.

##**5.) Fire units:**

- **Verdehile:** 10/10 (Dungeons, Dragons, Toa, Arena, GW)                       
max skilled. (even second skill- I know I goofed, plan to 6 a second one!)                 
Swift + Broken. Speed, crit chance, HP.               
Verdehile is an amazing unit. I have mine on swift, but I plan to 6 a second one and make him violent revenge. Swift secures dragons b10 for me. He is very viable on AD, and nets some wins. I use him once in a while on AO. He is commonly on my ToA team, and just works wonders. 10/10.


- **Raoq:** 9.5/10 (Farming, lowbie-arena)                    
Max skills.               
(currently) Vampire + Blade. Att / Crit chance / Att          
Raoq was my first farming unit. My first 6 star and the unit I used for most the game before I started to go P2P. He farmed faimon for me, he won me a ton of arena matches, and He got me to faimon hard. 20 second clear rates on faimon normal is no joke, and really helped me to push more 6 stars out.              
Currently I don't use him at all, but I can't ignore his presence in my journey. He did a lot of work for me. I hope to someday rune him with an amazing rage blade, or violent blade set and just pray to RNG for procs! haha. 9.5/10 


- **Sieq:** 10/10 (arena only)                    
Max skills                    
Swift + Blade. Speed / Crit Damage / Att.              
Sieq is such an amazing unit later in the game. 30% crit RATE buff, attack buff, and his second skill totally destroys units. With his buff and def break he can easily 1 shot Brands/ Chasuns / and most every fire unit. He not only kills units, but he helps all my other units to one-shot my opponents. He is hella squishy, and need protection, or just buff and dies. But he works wonders in arena. Kat + chloe + sieq is such a powerful combo. Sieq + any attacker is powerful! haha. Just such a good unit. 10/10 (arena)


- **Akia:** (3/10) (Arena, Toa)                 
No skills maxed.            
Rage + Blade. Att / Crit D / Att                    
I 6'ed her a long time ago, hoping she could help push toa, and one shot chasun. Honestly I was disappointed. her damage is weak, and I never really got her doing the damage I had hoped from her. She has a good kit, and I think I will try again someday, but for now I just don't see it happening. 3/10.


- **Arnold:** 8/10 (Toa [hard], GW, Arena)             
3rd skill is maxed               
Despair + Energy x3 hp%            
Personally I have a huge bias for arnold. I miss the good ole' days when he was very viable. He deals true damage, awesome for toa, self sustaining, and with despair he can really present problems for your opponents. He is kinda lacking in the dungeon section of the game, but he is a great Toa/GW/arena monster. 8/10



- **JoJo:** 7/10 (Arena)            
No maxed skills.            
Fatal + Focus. Att / Att / Att                  
I am (now) the proud owner of Seara. (As you may know, I rejected her for a very long time.) Seara + jojo + malaka (with chloe/megan) have brought me great joy in arena. For a long time, I used the same hand full of units for arena. Now that I have this combo max lvl, with 2/4/6 all at +15, and 1/3/5 at +12, I really am enjoying this bomb team. Personally I give them a 10/10 to all 3, but that is only because I have Seara.            
I have a hard time fighting comps with chloe, but if the AD only has Vero, I can always beat it. Personally I give the 'combo' 10/10. But jojo gets 7/10. Bombs with attack buff are incredibly deadly, but by themselves it is rather weak. I look forward to testing him in ToA hard. ~

- **Baretta:** 10/10 (Dungeons, ToA)             
Max skilled.                  
Despair + Focus. Speed / Hp / Hp                  
Baretta is my ToA king. He works wonders, Dots, Stunning, Att bar reductions. I mean he does a LOT. I also use to run him for Dragons b10. If you want to see the comp I used him in, please check out my guide linked below. 10/10.


- **Laika:** 5/10 (Arena, GW).            
Max skilled.               
Violent + Blade. Att / Crit D / Att.                 
When I got Laika I was pumped, 10/10 for sure. Dominated arena like it was easy mode. Now, it's not that I hate him, it's more like he doesn't live up to his competition, Theomars. I think Theomars does everything Laika does, but better.             
Both Violent. Check.            
Awoken bonus. Laika resistance (worst bonus for DD), Theo Crit Chance.                   
Passives. Laika can stun. Theo can shit on any element of his choice.                  
Second skill: Laika gets increased damage per dead ally. Theo gets a def break (AS A DD)....           
So yeah, I'm rather disappointed, he lost his 'uniqueness'. 5/10, probably lower. I plan to strip him of his runes if I ever get theo. 


- **Chloe:** 10/10 (Arena, GW, Toa)              
Max skills.                
Swift + Endure. Speed / Hp / Hp.               
I mean she is chloe. 1 turn invincibility, 2 turn immunity, Strong heal. She disrupts combo's. sustains life, and so on. 10/10.    
           

- **Spectra:** 10/10 DB10 | 10/10 ToA hard |           
Max skills.
Swift + Focus. Speed / Hp / Hp (235 speed, 25% accuracy!)            
Officially enabled me to speed farm Dragons b10. Carries me in toa hard, up to floor 70 on easy mode. Pretty awesome when paired with bernard / verdehile. I think he is an amazing unit, and happy I finally put work into him!       


- **Tesarion:** 8/10 (Arena, GW)                
Max skills.             
Violent + Revenge. Speed / Hp / Hp                    
Tes is such a cool unit. He can disrupt enemy units, and increase the damage they take. He comes with a def break + oblivion. That is pretty huge imo. I build him as a tank, because I want him to revenge as much as possible, while my DD takes down your units. I think he is awesome, i'm glad I 6'ed and maxed him. 8/10.

##**6.) Wind units:**


- **Orochi:** 8/10 (Giants B10, Gw, Lowbie-Arena)         
Maxed skills.           
Rage + Focus. Att / Crit Rate / Hp (100% crit)               
Orochi plus the Acasis HoH was my golden ticket to Giants b10, which was my first high content goal. Orochi was one of the first units I put a lot of effort into runing, skilling, and maxing. To this day, I find his stats hard to beat. I got crazy lucky with his subs, I think he only has one 5 star rune, the rest are all 6 stars. I put a lot of work into him, and he rewarded me for it. I was able to farm Giants b10 very quickly with this pair + shannon, bernard and bella. Orochi made it happen though. He really pushed me to where I am now. It's all about the runes here in SW.              
Even now that I run a speed team, he is still on my giants b10 line-up.  


- **Aarang:** 0/10           
Nothing maxed, some skill-ups.       
Unruned.            
To this day, I still don't know why I 6'ed her.. I seriously don't. I think I wanted to use her for giants and such, or arena maybe (?). I was so nooby back in the day..


- **Acasis:** now~ 5/10, Then~ 10/10             
Maxed skills.          
Despair + Energy. Speed / Hp / Hp              
Acasis with Orochi pushed me into giants b10 at such an early stage in the game. This combo was killer for arena, and for clearing bosses. They helped me in Toa, and Giants, Elemental dungeons and so on. They really did a lot for me.             
Today I don't have or see much use for her. I don't really recommend working on her since Vero has nearly replaced her entirely. 


- **Julien:** 6/10 (Toa, Dungeons, Gw, Arena)           
Maxed skills.             
Fatal + Blade. Att Crit D / Att (nooby set up.)             
I got Julien rather early on, and slapped some fatal runes on him since I was out of rage (still am) and had a high amount of fatals (still do).  I don't really know if he is still worth working on. But he definitely helped me early on. He helped me push ToA, elemental halls, HoH, and arena. He is a good unit, and will reward you if you put work into him, but there are better wind attackers imo. Lushen or any wind nat 5 will trump him.


- **Shannon:** 9/10          
Maxed skills.             
Swift + Focus. Hp / Hp / Acc            
Let me explain my runes for a sec. Personally I loved this set up. Yes it lacks the despair, but she gets more turns in return, WITHOUT speed on slot 2. More turns &gt; Chance to stun, for shannon imo. I use to use Shannon everywhere. I ran her in Giants b10, Toa 1-100, and even in some arena. Shannon is a unit I recommend to new players, she has an amazing kit, literally every skill is advantageous, which is very rare for most monsters. She is a dungeon master, a raid leader and a loyal companion. Supports win games.


- **Bernard:** 8/10           
10/10 Giants, B10 9/10 ToA Normal + Hard, 4/10 Arena and GW       
Maxed skills.         
Swift + Focus. Speed / Hp / Hp        
Bernard will always be one of my favorite units. He carried me early and mid game to push content. I'm very happy with the work I put into him. He helped me climb and clear Giants b10, and toa. He is a king.


- **Kat:**~/10 {Currently working on her}         
Meh imo, without chloe.         
Skills are in progress, she will be maxed soon.        
I fused kat early on. I thought she could be a farmer, and a decent monster when combined with neal. I was wrong. She WORKS, but I didn't like the results I saw. So i stripped her of her runes, and she has sat in my storage for the longest time. Now I want to work on her. Now I may even fuse and Max two of them! (We'll see, LOL). I highly discourage you from fusing her without Chloe. She wont help you clear content, she is only for arena and GW. Once these two things are your goal, feel free to focus on kat. until then, work on other monsters!


- **Teshar:** 5/10           
10/10 Secret dungeons, 4/10 Farmer, 3/10 Arena + Gw, 10/10 Giants B10            
Maxed skills.               
Rage + Blade. Att / Crit D / Att               
Teshar is really just 'Meh'. He has the highest base attack in the game, which is kinda fun to know. But he doesn't deliver much. His base hp at lvl 40 max, is like 7,400~ something. It's on the same level as a 6 star shannon LOL. Even if I bring him vs Water AD's, he will get solo'ed by the enemy vero/ chasun / chloe. He is not fun to pvp with despite his high attack. However he has made a great addition to my giants b10 team. It really speeds up the runs!


- **Chasun:** 10/10                 
10/10 Dragons B10, 10/10 Giants B10, 10/10 ToA Normal + Hard, 10/10 Arena + Gw.                
Maxed skills.                 
Violent + Endure. Speed / Hp / Hp (100% res)              
Chasun is my goddess. She is on my dragons b10 team for consistant clears. She is on my Giants b10 team, my toa team(s) (nearly every floor) and my AD and my AO. She is so stupidly good. PUT EVERYTHING YOU CAN INTO HER AND SHE WILL REWARD YOU FOR IT. Treat this pretty lady well, she pushes content and pvp like no other monster in the game.            

          
- **Seara:** 6/10            
10/10 Bomb team (mostly for fun), 10/10 Gw's. 0/10 Dungeons, ~/10 ToA (haven't used her in toa yet).               
Maxed skills.                
Fatal + Focus. Att / Att / Att                 
Seara completes my bomb team. She was the reason I ever 6'ed and worked on Jojo + malaka. I can honestly say it was worth it, since it restored my fun in arena since theomars was buffed. She is pretty great vs veromos, and in Gw flying solo. Her latest buff does give her a lot of killing potential. It's a lot of fun to work with. I'm glad I have one now :3 Thanks com2us.


- **Briand:** 8/10      
8/10 Giants B10, 9/10 Dragons B10, 10/10 ToA Normal + hard, 8/10 Arena + Gw.               
No skill-ups.            
Despair + Endure. Hp / Hp / Def (place holder)         
Briand is the real deal as far as revive units go. He is tanky, his revive balances Hp, he has an AoE for making use of despair runes. He has some debuffs. I mean he just covers so much ground. I run him in my giants b10 team sometimes, my dragons team if I feel like going right &gt; boss, My toa teams, and he put in work for me in pvp. Solid all around unit. I can say he is worth working on for sure.

##**7.) Light and Dark units**

- **Ahman:** 4/10                  
0/10 Early game, 8/10 Mid game, ~was 10/10 late game, now 0/10.            
Maxed skills.                  
Violent + Guard. Hp / Crit R / Hp (100 crit)               
Ahman has been a bit of a roller coaster for me. Early game I could't find runes for him. Later on, he got decent. Then he got great. he use to carry me all the way to Toa 100. He was on my Giants and dragons teams at some point. I use to use him in arena once in a while. Now I don't use him, ever. Once I put work into bella, picked up a chloe and chasun, it was over for poor Ahman. It almost hurts, knowing how much I struggled to get him to be good, but I don't regret our journey Ahman. Maybe someday you will shine again!                


- **Bella:** 10/10                 
10/10 Giants and Dragons B10, 8/10 ToA Normal + Hard, 10/10 Pvp          
Maxed skills.                
Violent + Focus. Speed / Hp / Hp                 
I love my bella. Bella has carried me into some higher level content. The defense break with the speed buff and a strong AoE heal. Bella is a force to reckon with. She puts in a lot of work, and with her cleanse is rather unique. I use to run her on almost every team I made. My giants/dragons, toa, Arena team.. All of them included bella. Now-days I have more options, but she use to be the one who covered all the bases I needed covered. She has such an amazing kit. highly recommended. 


- **Darion:** (A work in progress)/10            
Maxed skills                 
(missing runes) Violent + Revenge. Hp / [Hp V.S. Crit D] / Hp          
I think i'll decide on hpx3. I'm holding off for x2 more 6 star hp runes. It might be a while. I only recently 6'ed him, and he is definitely in line for his runes. I just need dragon to drop them haha :3. I honestly can't wait to rune him though.. So many players love him. My only advice, would be work on him later in the game. He is mostly a pvp monster. I mean look at me, I cleared both b10's and toa 100, toa hard 70 without him. The light 'trio' is a lie. it's mostly just bella lol. Darion for pvp later. Ahman (now) never. 



- **Vero:** 10/10              
10/10 Dragons + Giants B10, 10/10 ToA normal + hard, 10/10 PvP              
Maxed skills.             
Violent + Focus. Speed / Hp / Hp                 
This was my first and only build for him so far. He is amazing. I love his kit, the content he helped me push. Just everything about vero makes him 10/10. He is a god in SW, along side the goddess Chasun, this pair can conquer so much of this game together. Be kind to Vero, and he will help you achieve your goals.          


- **Jubelle:** (Work in progress)/10              
Maxed skills.               
Unsure of how to rune~               
I honestly only 6'ed this guy because I keep getting wrecked by them in high level pvp, Gw's and even C3 arena. I can't figure out how I want to rune him, it's pissing me off to no end. I think Hp / Crit D / Hp. But I have no idea. In the mean time i'll just suffer getting beat by him QQ.

\~*Intro and Goals:*~

Hi, I'm Witheringsoul. AKA, Mikey. I am a consistant C3 player on Global. I currently have 35 x 6 stars, at the time of making this guide. I can farm dragons b10, Giants b10, clear toa 100, and ~roughly floor 70 hard mode, when I care to. I have struggled to get to where I am, and I hope this guide helps people struggle less than I did :)

I'm going to make a mega advice/tip/guide 'thing' for players to be smarter. This thread will grow, and expand as time goes on.

\~*Topics elaborated*~

**1.) Should I work on this monster?**       

- You can 5 star literally ANY monster you wish WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE. 5 star monsters can always be food later. If you decide you don't like it, you can use it as 1/5 of the 5 stars you need to 6 star something.        
\*Conclusion:* You can only benefit from 5 starring, nothing is lost.

***

**2.) What runes should I put on this monster?**       

- Non-attackers have three main sets: Despair, Swift, and Violent.      
 *Honestly THERE ARE NO WRONG ANSWERS.*              
-It is wise to rune units that have AoE with DESPAIR, for more chances to stun.         
-It is wise to rune people you need to move/initiate/buff fast, with SWIFT.           
-Lastly it is wise to rune monsters that need to refresh cooldowns quickly with VIOLENT.     

- Attackers should always be one of two options (majority of the time):       
-Rage/blade For pure nuking.           
-Violent/blade/revenge. For % chance to 100% to 0% nuke units.            
-IN some ODD cases, you might rune fatal. 

- Bombers or Non-traditional attackers, Fatal is first choice. (they different mechanics from standard attackers). Fatal is also a good choice when beginning your summoners war journey. As you get higher crit chance on your runes please see  the previous suggestion!

- For better a better understanding of runes and when to buy/use them please check out these 2 amazing guides:       
1 https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerswar/comments/372pdq/guide_to_runes_rule_of_thumbs/             
2 http://forum.com2us.com/forum/main-forum/summoner-s-war/guides-and-tips-ac/649166-monster-rune-compilation.      

***

**3.) What is the BEST way to farm exp?**           

- You do a mix of unknown scrolls/ Mystic scrolls, rainbowmon (dragons/toa/GW/giants) for fodder. You get the exp boost. You farm whatever you think is most efficient and get all the exp's. You evolve. CONGRATS you have a 6    
 Recommended farming areas: faimon stage 1 normal. (best for newer players). Tamor 3 is also very good for newer players! Hydeni stage 5 (hell is really easy) and some others. i'll get back to this later.           
 As you get stronger you will aim to farm Faimon hell (stage 1) and Aiden hell (stage 1). These 2 spots are amazing for higher leveled players!           
- Be sure to check out this EXP guide/chart for all the top hot spot farming area's!:                     
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KsasIjvQ_QHmeT43hHrlZZKaDhhqBxmKHWfd76GIYSs/edit#gid=711871482 (by /u/tkddans)
- Make SURE that double exp booster is ACTIVE at all times!

***

**4.) What is the best way to farm runes?**     
  
- Campaign stages normal/hard/hell.      
- Boss stages normal/hard/hell.     
- Giants b5/Dragons b4.       
- Giants b7/Dragons b6.      
- Giants b8/Dragons b6-b7 still fine.       
- Push for Giants b10/Dragons b9.       
- Dragons b10.

***

**5.) Should I 6 this monster?**         

- First off, I honestly feel anything worth keeping is worth 6'ing, and even though it's hard to get started, eventually you will 6 all the monsters possible.               
Anyways let's get back to it. This question I answer with a series of questions: Do you use this monster a lot? Do you think it will help you advance? Is the monster dying at 5 stars? If your goals are PvE related, is it a PvE monster? If your goals are PvP, is it a PvP related monster? Do you have it runed?         
If you answer yes to any/most of these questions, then yes. It is worth 6 starring. 

***

**6.) What should my Giants b10 team be?**     

- Shannon, bernard, bella. These 3 should be and are the best foundation to any giants team. Yes they are basic monsters, Yes they are farmable. Yes they are worth 6'ing. And Yes there are amazing units to have.                 
Once you have those 3, next you will want +1 cleanser/side healer/shield unit/ or tank.             
The last slot should +1 attacker (for speed), OR +1 support (for safety).

***

**7.) What should my dragons b10 team be?**       

- Vero, Bella. These 2 units are the basic components to any dragons b10 team.           
That leaves +3 units. To decide what to use, ask yourself what kind of comp would work best for you.              
- x \*Dot Comp.**\- usually includes: baretta, Vero, bella, +1 healer, +1 reviver. Healer could be Ahman/chasun. Reviver would be Mikene, Michelle, Briand, nat 5s. Right tower &gt; boss        
- x \*Safe but slow comp*\- Vero, Bella, Ahman, Kona, + attacker/support. Maybe Megan, or bernard(?) (for some speed, needs rougly 25k hp, spd/hp/hp). Left &gt; Right&gt; boss          
- x \*speed comp*\- Verdehile, Vero, Bella, [Spectra/Megan], +1 attacker (usually sig). Boss                
- x \*Consistant comp*\- Verde, vero, sig, [bella/chasun], Reviver [Mikene,Briand, Michelle]. right&gt; boss

***


**8.) Toa in general**     

- Here is my best advice for toa, people can clear floors 1-100 with FREE TO PLAY monsters. \*This means, it is NEVER your monsters holding you back. It's merely your line-up, who you have 6'ed and YOUR RUNES.*

***

**9.) AD, GW, AO- lower leveled players**           

- If you are not level 35 Just don't even think about arena. Don't put up great defenses until the weekend. Practically forget it exists. You wont be able to push high ranks, which are a LUXURY. All pushing rank does, is prove to yourself how strong your monsters are.               
Don't fool yourself, if you aren't lvl 35+ you wont be able to compete higher than fighter.           
It's MOST EFFICIENT to put little-to-no-defense at ALL, and push on reset day just for crystals. Keep in mind going a rank up only gives 50 extra crystals. It's really not that big a deal.        
Losing is okay in AO; it lowers your ranking to get easier opponents, and you still get one glory point per loss.                     
(TL;DR): Just make sure to farm enough points for the weekly devilmon! Also weekly GW's rainbowmon is an important buy! If you farm extra glory, all the better! 180 points a week should be the goal though.

***

**10.) AD, GW, AO- Higher leveled players.**         

- If you need help with your AO, you might want your IQ checked, honestly it should change to every different AD you see. It should be all your top monsters, and you should never set your AO in stone.            
AD, try to aim for this standard CONQ AD - Vero, Darion [chasun/chloe], [Briand/theomars/bella].                
Guardian - will depend on your runes, and the nat 5's you have. It can be done WITHOUT nat 5s, but trust me, it will make life easier.

***

**11.) Should I buy this rune?**

- For this I'd like to bring up previous links once again -        
1 https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerswar/comments/372pdq/guide_to_runes_rule_of_thumbs/          
2 http://forum.com2us.com/forum/main-forum/summoner-s-war/guides-and-tips-ac/649166-monster-rune-compilation.        
A more personal answer would include answering this question, with a question.
-Do you have Mana for ""x"" rune?
-Do you have someone that could immediately make use of this rune?
-Do you already have a rune in this slot with the same %/subs?
-Do the Subs have flat units or '%''s?
-Do you think a monster could benefit a lot from this rune?
If you answered yes to most these questions, probably buy it. If still unsure, please visit the links posted above.

***

**12.) Why can't I beat ""X""?**

- I'm 98% positive it's your runes. Please see previous information from this post regarding topic #4 'Where should I farm for runes?'

***

**13.) Just have fun!**

- Seriously, enjoy this game! It is amazing, and we all share it :) This game has no right or wrong way! We are on our own, and the smarter/more knowledgeable you are as a person, the more you can make of Summoners war!

***

**14.) What should I spend glory on?**

- First of all, make sure to get your weekly devilmon (180 glory a week). Also make sure to get your 4* max rainbowmon from guild wars every week!.              
Next work on your energy buildings. Making these capped will allow you to farm more runes/exp and overall play the game more at a time!             
After successfully working on your energy buildings, be sure to work on your Speed totem, or HP building if you feel it will help your monsters out more. Speed is ideal because it is both offensive and defensive. But I won't tell you have to live :)          
(TL;DR): Don't buy MS from the glory/GW shop. Like EVER. 

***

**15.) Lunateric's advanced rules for rune filtering!**

- × Don't keep runes that have two or more flat subs.           
× Don't keep runes that upgraded a preexisting flat sub.              
× Don't keep 5* runes unless they are legendary and posses useful subs.             
× Don't keep a rune that had two consecutive low rolls while upgrading it.              
× Don't keep a rune that upgraded resistance unless it's endure and possibly energy.              
× Don't keep an off-hand (slot 1, 5, since 3 can't have attack subs) fatal rune that upgraded a defense sub.              × Don't keep a swift rune that doesn't have speed subs, unless it has at least two other important subs with high rolls.

- Higher level rules (to be used in conjunction with basic rules):         
× Keep only main-hand (slot 2, 4, 6) runes that have three useful stats, counting their suffix.          
× Keep only off-hand (slot 1, 3, 5) runes that have four useful stats, counting their suffix.


***

**16.) Friend's Reps and you! Making the best out of x2 exp boosts!**

- So you just popped that x2 exp booster, and farming fodder. How can you make the most of this situation?        
Friends.     
Using a friend's rep will allow you to free up a slot in your team! The Rep does not take absorb any exp like your own bus driver will!            
Completing the map will give a set amount of exp, which is divided by however many units you bring.          
using simple numbers; let's say a clear gives 100 EXP. If you only have 1 unit, that 1 unit will get all 100 EXP.       
If you have two units each unit will get 50 Exp EACH. At 4 units, you will get 25 Exp Per monster.          
So if you use a friend's bus driver, it will free up a slot, even if you have the REP+3 of your fodder monsters the 3 monsters YOU own will get the 100 Exp. being 33.33 Exp each. VS. 25 Exp each with your own bus driver (not using a rep)

***

**17.) 5 star runes VS 6 star runes. Additional info on upgrading slots 1/3/5 VS 2/4/6**

- 5 star runes are fine to +15 on slots 2/4/6 imo. +15 5 star rune for hp (for example) is 51%, 6 star is 63%. Yes you miss out on 12% bonus HP but even for the HIGHEST base value hp monsters (13,000 base hp) that is only 1,560 hp. Honestly you will survive without that. Now 3 hp% 5 star runes vs 3 hp% 6 star runes is nearly 5,000 life. Which can be a big deal, but you can always level the rune to +15 and switch it out for a 6 star rune later! So no harm done :)               
Obviously it's better to +15 6 star runes, but +15 5 star runes is honestly just fine :)                       
DO NOT +15 1/3/5 slots tho. Only the MAIN stat will increase, which doesn't help the subs. They are only flat stats and +15 wont serve you that well.                               
1/3/5 slots should be +12 at max, +9 is also just fine imo.
