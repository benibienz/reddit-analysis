This will work for a most apps, but not for things like what app clicking on a link to a specific website triggers (say, Wikipedia Beta opening vs. Wikipedia when you click on a Wikipedia link, or opening an xkcd reader instead of your default web browser when you click on a link to xkcd.com.)",2016-10-15 07:51:19+00:00,d8suymi,1.0,t3_51gs5f,3329496.0,AndroidQuestions

MQs: 93/46/83/68

I'm a mainly Watchful-Dangerous, Neutral-Good Person of Some Little Consequence up for nearly anything - making new friends for chess, fisticuffs, or expeditions, whatever. I also wouldn't mind if someone came along and patronized me.

I was drawn from the Surface-colonies to London a few months ago in search of justice for my lost lover, for whose murder I was framed.  I'm keen on exploring far-flung nations of the Unterzee and uncovering the mysteries of cities long fallen, among other things. Because of my abominably short attention span and my tendency to go around obstacles rather than grind through them, I'm spread all over the place, like maple syrup on a Canadian's diet. My main goals, however, are finishing my Ambition and getting my hands on some kind of Ship.",2016-07-30 05:13:47+00:00,d5wvdpi,1.0,t3_4riev4,2044627.0,fallenlondon
2,"What about the Nexus 5X? Sprint [says](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sprint/comments/40t550/sprint_lte_plus_devices/) it supports 2x on their network. Since it has the same SOC/modem as the MXPE, am I correct in assuming that it won't be 3x compatible?",2016-06-20 21:50:25+00:00,d4h71po,2.0,t1_d4gbb0f,58620.0,Sprint
3,"That's a really great idea. Put a tracker package on a Hornet Ghost and make a perfect assassin, or on an info runner or exploration ship and have a dedicated PI. Or even an entire ship dedicated to tracking. There are info runners and news vans now, so why not?",2016-03-04 06:50:54+00:00,d0n3fxn,3.0,t1_cydiflp,5795444.0,starcitizen

10,"Unfortunately, pics are impossible with the cameras I own. My unit was almost definitely stored in a warehouse for long periods of time. I have no idea if the warehouse was climate controlled, and I think that it is conceivable that exposure over a long period of time to extreme or fluctuating temperatures, which is also plausible, since the warehouse was in Arizona, could produce this effect. When I talked to a Razer representative, he said that he had one at home and it looked the same way, but 1) I'm not sure I trust him, because based on other customers' experiences, Razer customer service seems to exist to save Razer the most money possible rather than give customers the best experience possible (replacing laptops outright, while excellent for customers, doesn't save Razer money.) and 2) I'm not sure whether the effect is abnormally pronounced on my unit. That's my primary concern. The condition would be tolerable if I knew I didn't have a really bad case of it. But I have less than a week now to send it back to Amazon, so I need to know if it's a defect.",2015-08-21 06:51:48+00:00,cuaeyg0,1.0,t3_3epefs,2189748.0,razer
11,"Visual texture. On the phone screen I am looking at right now, all the white pixels in the text field I'm typing in are just pure, identical white. If I was to view the same text field on my Blade, some pixels would look darker. It makes the solid white look grainy everywhere. It's difficult to describe. I can't get pics until tonight or later, though, and I'm not sure it will appear in the pictures.",2015-07-28 16:28:07+00:00,ctj4pib,2.0,t1_cth8gfi,142997.0,razer
