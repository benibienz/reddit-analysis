I have no idea whether it will be supported or not on the MXPE. I haven't been able to find any threads that explicitly confirm or deny it, and all of them are 8 months old anyway. I did find that it uses the same SIM as the Nexus 5X and possibly the HTC One M9, which are both supported for 2-carrier aggregation.
Additionally, the MXPE's [Qualcomm Snapdragon 808](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/snapdragon/processors/808) processor is supposed to support 3x20MHz carrier aggregation, and is the same processor as the one in the aforementioned Nexus 5X. The MXPE also supports all the individual bands used in carrier aggregation, of course.
Again, though, I haven't seen any confirmation that it works/*is enabled in the radio* from a credible source.
Can anyone from Sprint help me on this?",Sprint,Moto X Pure 3x20MHz Carrier Aggregation Support?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sprint/comments/4owu85/moto_x_pure_3x20mhz_carrier_aggregation_support/

I have a Nexus 5 (2013, 32GB) running Android 5.1.1 and a 14"" Razer Blade (2014) running Windows 10. Every time I connect my phone to my PC via a USB cable, my Blade makes the connect/disconnect chimes in rapid succession (usually as soon as one chime finishes the next starts). The N5 appears to be charging, but I can't see it in My Computer (although I haven't tried it, I would think that adb is out of the question.) I managed a few times to fight my way through Control Panel to the device properties and update the USB drivers associated with my phone, but it said they were all up to date. I have verified that this is not an issue with the USB cable I am using by trying it with multiple. I never had any problems connecting my N5 to my previous laptop, a MacBook Pro (Late 2011.) It's infuriating.

I'd greatly appreciate any help or ideas.",AndroidQuestions,Nexus 5: rapidly connecting/disconnecting to PC via USB,https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/3nswb6/nexus_5_rapidly_connectingdisconnecting_to_pc_via/

One of my only issues with it is that the display looks mottled, like leatherette. It's most apparent on solid colors, especially whites. It's such a strong effect that solid colors don't even look solid, and I find it irritating. I've never had or seen a laptop display that looked like this before. Do all 2014 14"" Blade QHD displays look like this, or is mine defective?

The effect is too subtle for my camera to capture, and it's all messed up because it's a picture of a screen anyway, but here's a picture of a sheet of parchment - it looks a little like [this](http://static.tumblr.com/686d30a36765c1b0f32410480a180f94/affnjbm/1MMn7bwwo/tumblr_static_e8pm9nd22xsgcscok0wcg8os.jpg), but more subtle and more white. The effect is more pronounced on the lower portion of the screen. I should also mention that I bought the laptop ""Used - Like New"" from Amazon Warehouse Deals.",razer,"2014 Blade 14"" display has mottled texture",http://www.reddit.com/r/razer/comments/3epefs/2014_blade_14_display_has_mottled_texture/
