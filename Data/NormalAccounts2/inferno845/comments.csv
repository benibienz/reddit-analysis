I mixed 6g of Citrulline, 3g of Beta Alaine, 5g of Creatine, 200mg of caffeine, and 1.4g of Crystal Light Green Tea Peach Mango Drink Mix. I couldn't sit still, and got one of the best workouts I've had in a while, even though I was in a shitty hotel gym. I got the L-Citrulline here, the Beta Alaine here, and the Crystal Light here. Those were all from Amazon, and were basically exactly enough to mix together right out of the package. Dump everything in a bowl, mix, and you have 83.333 servings. The caffeine pills and the Creatine I got on MyProtein.com for pretty darn cheap. I had to crush the pills and it wasn't hard, considering you just count out 83 pills and use a hammer/rolling pin to powderize them, but it would definitely be easier to get powder and measure out 16.667g of it and toss it in the mix. To get 83ish servings of the Creatine, measure out 1 and 3/4 cups of the stuff and throw it on in. It cost a little over $70 and makes as I said 83.3 servings, and only has what I think are the relatively necessary pre-workout components in it. The Crystal Light confess in other flavors but the Amazon link above gives just about exactly enough for 80ish servings if mixed with 16oz of water. Go for it, I'm glad I did!

101,"Sam tapped his foot on the floor as he finished up his calc test.  As was normal, he finished his exam just as Anna did.  After all, he was listening to how she worked out the last problem.  This had been Sam‚Äôs test-taking method for years; go over enough of the material for a decent understanding the night before, and then read the mind of the smartest person in the room for some tips and assurance.  It worked well, and was just another convenience reading minds had allowed.  Although Sam knew that he was different, he never really felt like there was anything special about him.  He had possessed this ability for as long as he could remember, and it felt completely natural; just another one of his senses.  It had become apparent at a young age that his family and friends could not hear what each other were thinking.  He heard as his parents‚Äô thoughts contradicted what they would tell him, and noted how his friends thought of him differently than what they would say.  This complete access to unfiltered judgement had driven him to isolation, and he had developed trust issues early on.  As he matured Sam grew to understand that people‚Äôs thoughts were not typically as hurtful as they seemed.  They were obviously not intentionally trying to cause him any harm, seeing as how they kept their thoughts as thoughts.  Hell, Sam thought the same way others did, except no one could hear.  So, during the most recent half of his nineteen years, Sam learned to take what he heard from others‚Äô minds with a grain of salt.  He grew into an outgoing young man, surrounding himself with a tight group of friends who he knew, for a fact, reciprocated what he felt towards them.  Despite this, absolutely no one knew of what he could do.  Sam had learned how personal and valuable thoughts were to people, and he feared that if his secret was revealed, no one would ever behave the same way around him.  His ‚Äúpower‚Äù was his gift and burden to bear alone.  It had gotten him to where he was now; a lecture hall at Princeton University, taking a calc 2 exam.  Sam sat back, waiting for the rest of the class to finish.  Tired from the night before, he sunk down in his seat, letting his mind wander throughout the room and his peers.  *‚Ä¶of x squared over x plus seven equals, damnit.  Screw profess-  ‚Ä¶do I use the identity matrix for this?  I‚Äôll just put det(x) down and-  ...My god Amanda is hot. She has to know her thong is sticking out.*  Sam sat up at this one.  Amanda was only two rows ahead, and he saw what Dylan had been thinking about.  *Come on Dylan, shes like a 6 tops,* Sam thought to himself as he sat back again.  *‚Ä¶hey you, I know you can read my mind.  Yeah, you there.*  Sam rolled his eyes.  There was at least one person per week who tried to get a reaction out of ‚Äúmind readers‚Äù.  He knew no one really intended to find a one, because, well, he could read their minds, and they typically called themselves stupid after no one responded.  *‚Ä¶Wow real original.  Next time you should just scream ‚ÄúI KNOW YOU‚ÄôRE A MIND READER!‚Äù and then see who doesn‚Äôt look.  Idiot.*  Sam sat straight up.  Had he just heard someone respond to another person‚Äôs thoughts?  No, it couldn‚Äôt be.  He scanned the back of the room, where he had assumed the two voices had come from, and listened intently for the same one he had heard.  *‚Ä¶this school.  It‚Äôs nowhere near worth the commute.  I would almost rather take classes on phoenix.edu than have to listen to these stuck up prudes and their even more stuck up thoughts all day.*  It was the same voice, coming from the kid sitting in the back left of the stadium-styled lecture hall.  He wore light blue jeans and a dark purple sweatshirt with a large Ravens logo on the front.  Sam recognized him as the new kid who joined his class just this past week.  *Josh, was it?*, he thought.  The new kid looked down and saw that Sam was staring directly at him.  *That was really strstrSTRSTRSTRSTRSTRSTRSTR-*  ‚ÄúAhhhhhhh!‚Äù Sam and Josh both screamed in unison.  Everyone looked up to see the two with their hands pressed against their temples, eyes squeezed shut.  Sam tried to clear his mind and focus on the tapping of his foot; a method he had used for years to tune out the unwanted thoughts around him.  It wasn‚Äôt working this time, however.  The strength of the voice that he heard in his mind a few moments earlier was unlike anything he had ever experienced.  Yes, some people did have naturally louder thoughts than others, but this had felt as if a megaphone was put up against his ear and someone blew an air horn into it.  It had blown his ‚Äúsixth sense‚Äù wide open, and he found it hard to evade the bombardment of thoughts attacking him from everyone in the room.  Sam quickly stood and made his way to the front of the room, handing in his paper shakily, and mumbling an apology to his professor.  After slowly making his way to the bathroom, using the wall as a crutch, he turned on the sink and splashed some cold water on his face.  He hadn‚Äôt felt like this since he was in elementary school.  Back then, his parents were extremely concerned about his mental well-being.  Any time he would be taken out into public, he would cry and scream about all of the voices in his head.  His mom and dad took him to a number of specialists to get help with their son‚Äôs strange behavior.  Diagnoses ranged from autism to Dissociative Identity Disorder, and Sam spent a large portion of his early childhood with these specialists and therapists.  They were amazed when his symptoms suddenly stopped.  Sam still shied away from crowds in general, but was now able to attend larger gatherings without the accustomed fits.  What they didn‚Äôt know was that Sam had finally managed to tune out the thoughts of those around him, finally giving him a relative peace of mind.  Sam now tried to think back to that day, focusing on the tremendous relief of hearing nothing.  He gained some slight composure back just as the door to the bathroom slammed open, revealing Josh standing in the door way, face contorted with pain and confusion.  ‚ÄúWhat,‚Äù he asked between breaths, ‚Äújust happened?‚Äù  Sam didn‚Äôt know how to respond.  He was fairly certain that the guy who stood before him could read people‚Äôs minds just as he could.  But that was preposterous!  Nineteen years without ever finding someone like him, and then all of a sudden, this?  ‚ÄúDid you hear what I did?‚Äù  Sam asked, looking inquisitively at Josh.  ‚ÄúYou mean that earth-shattering one just a minute ago?  No I don‚Äôt think I did,‚Äù  Josh replied, seeming to have collected himself.  *He is obviously dropping all pretense of acting like he can‚Äôt read minds.*  Sam thought.  Then he stopped.  He shouldn‚Äôt think.  What if it happened again?  But, how could he not think?  ‚ÄúSo,‚Äù Sam said hesitantly, ‚Äúyou can‚Ä¶ read minds?‚Äù  ‚ÄúI thought that was a little obvious seeing as how you can too.  You‚Äôre the first person I‚Äôve ever met that can do it.‚Äù  It seemed strange to Sam that he was talking so openly about it.  ‚ÄúYeah, same here,‚Äù he said.  Josh continued, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kinda weird that we would finally find someone else who can do what we can, and have him be the same age, attending the same university.‚Äù  ‚ÄúTell me about it,‚Äù Sam said, giving a half chuckle.  ‚ÄúI accepted a long time ago that I wouldn‚Äôt find anybody else.‚Äù  He combed his fingers through his dark brown hair, unsure of what to say next.  What did you do when you found out that you weren‚Äôt stranded on an island by yourself anymore?  ‚ÄúWhat happened back there?‚Äù he asked Josh.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know for sure, but I think it may have been some kind of feedback loop.‚Äù  ‚ÄúHaha, you think.‚Äù Sam said, scratching the back of his neck.  ‚ÄúSorry, that was extraordinarily lame.  Let me start over.  My name is Sam, I‚Äôm nineteen, soon to be a mechanical engineer, I have an undying hatred for the Ravens, and oh yeah, I read minds on occasion.‚Äù  Josh chuckled, ‚ÄúWell I‚Äôm in basically the same boat.  My name is Josh, same age, going for a degree in computer science, I can‚Äôt stand the... Steelers?‚Äù  He smiled as he saw a smirk appear on Sam‚Äôs face.  He continued, ‚Äúand I have been known to read some minds here and there.  Well not known for it, but you know what I mean.‚Äù  Sam smiled, ‚ÄúGod, this is so weird!  Finally, someone who understands all of this.  Too bad we had to find each other by nearly blowing up our brains,‚Äù he said dryly.  ‚ÄúSo you said you think that was some type of feedback?‚Äù  Josh nodded slowly, chewing on one of his thumbnails.  ‚ÄúIt would make sense.  I focused on what you were thinking when I saw you looking at me.  You must have been reading my mind at the same time, and then thought something yourself.  I guess it would work like any other feedback, but since our minds can communicate nearly instantaneously, the volume went from zero to a million real quick.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI guess that does make sense, or at least as much as it‚Äôs ever going to,‚Äù Sam said.  ‚ÄúDo you wanna get out of this bathroom before everyone thinks we‚Äôre weirder than they do already?,‚Äù  ‚ÄúYeah I‚Äôm done for the day,‚Äù Josh replied, ‚ÄúDo you wanna grab lunch or something?‚Äù  Sam nodded his head, ‚ÄúSounds like a plan.  And let‚Äôs try and keep our minds away from each other until we figure some stuff out.  I don‚Äôt want to go catatonic before I see if Anna aced that test for me.‚Äù

It's awesome to increase your lifts and your muscles, and to do that you need to eat more, which inevitably leads to some fat gain.  The amount of fat depends on how many calories you eat over your TDEE.  If you want minimal fat gain, then you should calculate your TDEE with an online calculator, and aim to eat about 200-300 calories above that per day.  This is what's known as a slow-bulk, or lean-bulk.  It will take a little longer to see increases in muscle mass, but it will minimize fat gain as well.
