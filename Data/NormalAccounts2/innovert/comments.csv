Some of that is going over my head because I'm still pretty new to Python, but I get what you mean about sticking with either an OOP or FP approach.

Strangly enough, using 

wob = draw_Weather() 

vs 

draw_Weather() 

for the initial call to draw_Weather() produces the image (for a moment). So it appears you are onto something with referencing the function this way. I removed the WeatherClass call I was using for testing, but it didn't seem to change the flow of the program (though I do see your logic there).

&gt; Make sure that the variable which references to the image, in turn, has something referencing it -- usually as an attribute of the main app class (Tk or Window or Frame)

I now have it set up a lot more efficiently I think, to where:

-Input is sent to my push() function (which then inserts it into the front of my Linked List) and this is repeated for all values entered.

After the values have been entered, I am calling my pop() function, the goal of which is to read the values from the list from first to last.
The problem I am having is that the function I am using to iterate through my list and read out the results is only giving me the last result entered (I guess its nice that its giving me something..)

Because I saw it done on a tutorial that way (never dealt with stacks before, heh). Fixed.

&gt;But why do you need a listEntries method, anyway? You already have a list, don't you? Isn't your listEntries method part of your list class?

Yes, the listEntries() is a part of my List class. I guess I don't really need it. I thought I would, so that I could convert between by linknode objects and doubles (to avoid the jumbled strings from being printed)

&gt;I guess you have some kind of linked list of Doubles, is that right? And you want to push them onto a stack of Doubles, and then pop them off in the reverse order. Is that right?

That is exactly right

&gt;What is the purpose of the Stacker class? Why don't you just use a java.util.Stack?

Because my assignment specifies that I must use a seperate class for the stack, and I do use java.util.Stack within that class.

**Here is the entire List class:** http://pastebin.com/zwc2DmNV

**Stacker class:** http://pastebin.com/59pfc2Wx

70,"I basically made the listEntries() method to iterate through my Linked List and return the results one at a time to be pushed into the stack (good point about push() taking arguments) 

I modified my stack to be a List stack instead of a Double stack (not sure if that was a good move), and made push take a list argument.

Short of learning the debugging system in Eclipse (which I should learn one of these days anyways), is there maybe an easier way I'm not seeing to print values from my linked list (rather than overwriting toString)?

I want to start pushing values onto a stack, but feel that would be a mistake before I know that things are working correctly.

EDIT: I took your advice and overwrote toString() in my List class by adding this
