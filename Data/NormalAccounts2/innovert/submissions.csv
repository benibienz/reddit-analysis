I'm playing with Tkinter for the first time, and am having some weird results when I am trying to update part of the window.

I'm using Open Weather Maps API to get and display current weather, and I'm also displaying a corresponding icon. 

The part I'm having an issue with, is getting the icon to stay on the screen. I'm able to update the weather status and it stays on the screen just fine, but the icon will show up for a brief moment when the method is updated, and disappear. 

[This](http://pastebin.com/SDJCw0w2) is what that part of the code looks like.

What's strange is if I move the WeatherClass constructor to ouside of the def, both status/icon will be drawn, but not updated; If I move it inside the function the status is drawn and updated, and the icon comes and goes.

I've made some good progress, but I'm having an issue updating one of my methods and drawing it to my tkinter window.

The tkinter window is going to be holding several things, one of which is current weather conditions. I wrote a function that draws the current weather status and a matching icon, and I found a way to update the function, but the problem is that when I update it, it just draws another set of icons to the window.

So initially I have what I want, then 5 seconds later I have 2 sets of icons, then 5 seconds later 3..etc

Earlier tonight, I was playing fallout 4, and randomly my PC shut down. I restarted and kept going about my business.

Then a few hours later (also while gaming), my computer shut down again unexpectedly. This time, however, it will not turn back on.

It powers up for about 1/2 of a second, then dies.

In order to get it to do this again, I have to flip the psu switch off until power drains from the mobo. And then it will turn on for another 1/2 second.

I've had no issues with this build until today.

I'm plugged into a UPS, so it is likely not a surge/ under-voltage issue.

I've tried re-seating the PSU connections, and the RAM.

The motherboard and my keyboard have lights on, so I know power is flowing.




Really hoping someone can help.

Edit: Also tried with GPU unplugged, using only 1 stick of RAM, and I remembered earlier today I actually got a blue screen saying bad pool header.

I'm stumped.",techsupport,"PC randomly shut off, won't turn back on.",https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/3sw0k6/pc_randomly_shut_off_wont_turn_back_on/

The 2nd derivative is: f''(x) = -1 / 2x^3/2

I know based on looking at the graph of the original function that there appears to be a PI at x = 1, but can someone give me some advice as to how to work this out?

Very much appreciated :)",MathHelp,Finding concavity and points of inflection with 2nd derivative,https://www.reddit.com/r/MathHelp/comments/3svp4z/finding_concavity_and_points_of_inflection_with/

I am asked to find the **slope of the line tangent to the curve 2xy + 4^x = y^2 - tan(2x) at the point (0,1)**.

This problem involved product rule, constant multiple rule and implicit differentiation (as far as I can tell).

A little back story. When I was growing up, my dad worked in the Air Conditioning/ Heating and Air field. One day him and a coworker were loading up a cement cutter onto a lift, and the cement cutter began to fall. My dad (for whatever reason) tried to keep the cutter from falling, and hurt his back in the process. 10 years and 5 surgeries later, his lower lumbar region has several pieces of hardware keeping things ""together"", and he has a mesh in his stomach (to keep him from herniating) that causes him a lot of pain (he's tried having surgery to fix this to no avail). Needless to say he is unable to work, and has been relying on workers comp checks to get by. 

Today I called my dad to see how things were going, and he told me the news about being discontinued workers comp payments, and that his workers comp lawyer said that there was nothing he could do to help him. My dad said that he didn't receive any type of notice indicating that his compensation was going to be discontinued, and now he doesn't know what he's going to do.

Does anyone have a family member in a similar position, or been in this position themselves? are there any directions I can point him in to contest the discontinuation of his only source of income (or keep his moral up)?

I don't usually post these kinds of things here..but I hate seeing my family suffer and potentially lose their house over this.

Thank you.",legaladvice,"My family is hurting, and my dad's workers comp is being discontinued",http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3ac3rg/my_family_is_hurting_and_my_dads_workers_comp_is/
