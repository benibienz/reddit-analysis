26,"Ugh the fine tuning argument is not a good one. My biggest issue with it is the willy nilly fashion in which its supporters use the word ""probability"". It hurts me every time they say it. Just because something is conceivable does not mean it is possible. And without knowing what is or isn't possible, you can't possibly know what is probable. 

Just because we can imagine these constants being any infinite number of different values does not mean all values are possible. Perhaps these values are the only possible values, maybe they arrise endogenously. Until we can observe another universe, it's going to be difficult to arrive at any truth when it comes to the probability of our universe existing.

Also, this argument is silly just because it is like arguing the Grand Canyon must have been intelligently designed because it just so happens to follow the exact path the river within it takes. I mean, what are the chances of that? If the valley was even .00001 degree off it would no longer follow the river!

135,"....yes i asked that because YOU said only ACTIVE Mormons should be considered Mormon. So I asked you to define your terms. 

I don't know why you're so upset over all this. It makes more sense to take the church's numbers for what they are- the number of members that have not resigned or died etc. This is the ONLY 100% accurate number they can give, as I have repeatedly established. 

So like I did at the beginning, we only need to compare the church's numbers with the polling data to estimate the number of members that no longer identify as Mormon. This is the best we can do. The church doesn't have that data, as I previously established (you can't get a specific activity rate from the number of people that attend sacrament meetings on Sunday).

I can already tell you are going to argue with math, again. I'm going to guess you aren't very good at math, so let me illustrate this. If you are told that there are around  80 people in church every Sunday, that could mean that there is a group of 320 people that go to church on average 1 time every month. That would mean 320 technically ""active"" people, even though there are only 80 of them at church on any given Sunday. Or it could mean that there is a group of 80 people that go to church every Sunday no matter what. This would mean there are only 80 active members. So if we know the general sacrament attendance rate, we still know next to nothing about how many individuals are active. 

Please try to tell me my math is wrong...

136,"So 11 times a year and someone is not a Mormon? 

If someone goes to church 11 times a year, believes everything Mormons believe, is a member of the church, and identifies as Mormon then I think they are Mormon, and so does everybody else to be honest. 

You're going to have to accept that belief and activity both exist on scales, not some arbitrarily qualified dichotomy. ",2016-02-24 06:15:55+00:00,d0bo8hk,19,t1_d0bo229,403,exmormon
137,"Well you ignored like 90% of my argument- that activity and belief are not binary qualifications. 

Okay, so like i said before, how many times does someone need to go to church every year to be considered active? 

About the church knowing exactly how many members attend church each week... Sure they can tell you how many people are in a meeting house on any particular day, but they cant tell you WHO. Just because a certain ward averages 80 people (out of 300 on the rolls) per Sunday in sacrament  meeting DOES NOT MEAN THAT THERE ARE 80 PEOPLE WHO ARE 100% ACTIVE. There may well be 160 people who show up half the time etc.

So the church telling us that average attendance to sacrament meeting is around 36% doesn't really tell us all too much about how many individual people are at least partially active.

If you only want to include 100% active people then you aren't thinking straight.

You are so stuck in your black and white thinking it hurts.

138,"Because we are categorizing people by their beliefs and then counting them in order to see how many people are ""Mormon"".

Mormonism is a system of beliefs. Therefore, those that share that system of beliefs are Mormon. 

Mormonism is also an organization. Therefore if you are a part of the organization then you can be considered Mormon.

You cannot say ""If you don't go to the temple at least 1 time a month then you're not a TRUE Mormon"". 

Likewise, you can't say ""if you don't believe that polygamy is God's law then you aren't a TRUE mormon"". 

These are purely arbitrary qualifications. Just because someone doesn't fit your definition of Mormon doesn't mean they aren't. 

When you say the church should only report ""active"" members on their roll sheets, what arbitrary level of activity would you require? If someone missed that activity requirement by 1 church meeting, you wouldn't consider them to be Mormon? 

The reality is that being Mormon isn't black and white in the sense that you are suggesting. There aren't only members that are 100% active and others that are 0% active. There aren't only members that believe everything 100% and others that believe 0%.There are tons and tons of people in between. So to use an arbitrary level of activity or belief as a requirement to be considered Mormon is absurd.

The ONLY meaningful qualifier is that they identify themselves as Mormon. That IS black and white.

The church can only realistically tell us how many names they have on their member roll sheets, so that is what they give us. I am still a member of the church even though I identify myself as an atheist exmormon. I have not resigned, so I am still counted as a member. 

So just keep in mind that one can be a member of the Mormon church while not identifying as Mormon and vice versa. These are 2 separate things.

154,"That's very interesting and I would have to agree that specific forms of torture seem unusual in comparison to torture as a whole. 

This can also apply to things like fines. Perhaps nobody has ever been given a ticket for exactly $341.21 and such an event would be unusual. However receiving a fine of around $350 is not unusual. 

You've definitely given me something to think about. Thanks!

155,"I am comparing them, not equating them. 

Adolf Hitler was a murderer.
Charles Manson was a murderer.
They are both murderers, yet one was orders of magnitude worse than the other.

Stalin was a bad leader.
George W. Bush was a bad leader.
They were both bad leaders, but for very different reasons and on very different scales.

You can compare things and acknowledge similarities between things without saying they are the same. This is a crucial aspect of critical thought.

To say that a traffic ticket does not inflict suffering because torture inflicts much more suffering is a silly thing to suggest. 

To say that a traffic ticket is not cruel because torture is much more cruel is just as silly. 

The constitution does not qualify how cruel a punishment must be to qualify as such. Therefore, when you say that all cruel punishments are unconstitutional you must accept that even those punishments which are only very slightly cruel are also also just as unconstitutional.

This reasoning is exactly why the founding fathers made it ""cruel and unusual punishment"" instead of ""cruel or unusual punishment"". You would have quite a difficult time finding any punishment which is not even slightly cruel.

I am not contorting logic, I am using it. I doubt you have ever taken a formal logic course, seeing how you refuse to accept that an ""AND"" statement is not identical to an ""OR"" statement.

The fact is that the constitution does not qualify ""cruel"" in terms of how painful or how much suffering is inflicted. So in the eyes of that specific clause of the 8th amendment, the definition of cruelty is indiscriminate.

159,"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/death_penalty

Read up on that. As with the death penalty, there are more compelling reasons why torture should be considered illegal (e.g. proportionality and due process) as opposed to it being ""cruel and unusual"".

But first, do you now understand that ""cruel and unusual"" is not the same as ""cruel or unusual""?

Do we agree on this yet?

There is no point in moving on until we establish this. ",2016-02-08 06:24:13+00:00,czryqta,8,t1_czry9iz,1189,politics
160,"No it doesn't. ""Cruel and unusual"" does not include those things which are only cruel or only unusual. 

For example, sending people to prison, solitary confinement, and the death penalty are all cruel (not synonymous with unjustified or unethical) yet they are legal because they are not also unusual.

To help you understand the difference between an ""and"" statement and an ""or"" statement let me offer to you this example: If an employer wants to hire someone who has 10 years of relevant experience AND a valid driver's license, he will not be satisfied with someone who only has one or the other. He requires BOTH. If he said 10 years experience OR a valid driver's license then he would be satisfied with someone as long as they had at least 1 of the requirements. 

I am not arguing that torture is ethical or morally justifiable. I am just saying that your reasoning for why it IS illegal is faulty. I am not making any normative statements, only positive ones.

I am saying that torture is not unusual. It is acceptable to a large portion of the citizenry and has been used historically by almost every country.

The courts have previously ruled that ""cruel and unusual"" is not synonymous with ""cruel or unusual""

Therefore, you can't claim torture is illegal for the reason that it is ""cruel AND unusual"" since it does not meet both criteria.

167,"I'm a millennial and I love Bernie.

In my mind, there are two steps to determine whether or not someone will be effective. The 1st step is to determine what motivates this individual and decide whether or not they have integrity. If they are dishonest or untrustworthy, there is no need moving on to step 2, which is to determine competence.

It is obvious to me that Bernie is authentic as they come, and has the best interests of the poor and middle class in mind. He has been consistent for his entire political career. I have no reason to doubt his integrity or authenticity.

Step 2 is to determine competence.

Now, i accept that there are people far more educated than myself that each have conflicting arguments for the best way to run a country economically. I do not pretend to know some simple truth or insight as to how to best do so. I know our economy is an insanely complex system, where every action has a reaction which has its own reaction etc. I think anybody who says they know for certain the economic impact of any policy is fooling themselves. However, I am inclined to put a little more trust in those with successful experience, as Bernie has.

With that in mind, there is nobody else I would consider voting for. I can't completely trust people who are in bed with giant corporations, as those corporations are only contributing for something in return. This, alone, rules out nearly every serious presidential candidate. If I cant be sure a candidate has our best interests at heart, then what is the point?
And I cant vote for any serious republican contender, as they promote literally fascist ideologies. I can't trust Hillary, at least not nearly to the degree I trust Bernie.

So I just want an authentic, competent, trustworthy person who has my best interests at heart. Bernie is the only one that meets those requirements.

I probably got a bit too political for this sub, but I do think you are right that there is a correlation between millennialis giving up religion and voting for Bernie. The most obvious common denominator is the internet. We grew up with this amazing resource at the tips of our fingers and we are not afraid to use it. We can easily explore all the ideas presented to us. We can know everything there is to know about a candidate; his voting record, speeches given, interviews, donors etc. This is exactly why we know that Bernie is the real deal. It is also the exact same reason why we know that religions like Mormonism are not true. 

I think growing up with the internet has instilled in us millennials an inherent humility. We know we don't know everything. We know we aren't the smartest person that ever lived. We know we don't have any particularly special insight as to how the world works. And we know there are people who could destroy our loosely held and unresearched opinions in a heartbeat with a simple google search. This has made us aware of which arguments and ideas are defensible, and which of those are not. 

I don't really know though. I'm sure someone else has some good insight as to why these two seem to be correlated. ",2016-01-06 06:27:48+00:00,cyns7eh,1,t3_3zm9nz,32681,exmormon

When you have CEO's of these wannabe charities earning hundreds of thousands of dollars a year you are forced to consider that perhaps they are more interested in selfish pursuits than genuine charity. And i think that taking advantage of people who believe they are donating to a worthwhile charity is immoral and hypocritical. 

And I don't care if it is a uniquely LDS phenomenon or not. It does not change the hypocritical or immoral nature of the actions.
