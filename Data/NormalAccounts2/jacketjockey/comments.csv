2,"The static still buzzed in my ear as I drowned in nothingness and everything faded to black, still punctuated by hallucinated points of light. Eventually, out of the darkness, blurs of colors, and then shapes, emerged.

*Where am I?* I thought as I looked around me. It seemed vaguely like where I had gone unconscious...except where were the stars? In their place was a harsh stone ceiling, and a vast space barely, if at all, illuminated. I looked down at my feet--nothing much had changed there--and began to slowly stagger down what rapidly appeared to be a steep cliff.

*Oof.* I picked myself back up out of the dust and gazed into the impenetrable darkness. Perhaps it was my imagination, but there seemed to be eyes staring back at me...they moved closer, getting lighter until I could see the creature they belonged to. He was noble-looking, proud yet kind, with a cloak draped over his body. After a moment internally debating my sanity, he spoke.

""Well, it's not too often that I get to do this anymore. Used to be, in the good 'ol days when humanity was still bent on going everywhere, that I'd be able to let everyone know what was up while my buddies kept Hell going for me. Anyway--""

I butted in. ""Hell? So you're what, Satan or something?""

He seemed deeply offended by this, but shook his head gently and continued. ""My name is Lucifer, thank you very much. And, speaking of which, you should know by now that you're dead.""

Ouch. With that, he continued on. ""Anyways, what I was **trying** to say before I was rudely interrupted was that congratulations, you're the first person to die here. What that means is that you get to choose how this afterlife works--you can go my route, with eternal torture and brimstone and all that jazz...um, I know a few places have reincarnation, some have pleasure...regardless, it's all up to you, kid.""

""B-but why?"" *I may be dead, but this still feels like a bad trip.* ""Shouldn't that kind of stuff be up to God or something?""

Flippantly, Lucifer responded, ""No, God's been dead a while. Whole Nietzsche thing, there was a book about it, blah blah. Anyways, I just thought I'd let you know the situation, especially since you probably won't get any visitors for a long while. If you're lacking for things to do, just wander around outside--I hear the view's incredible. Stop by once in a while. You can't bother the living anyways."" With a flash and the smell of ozone, he was gone.

Light broke in from the cavern's mouth, and I walked over to greet it. As I looked off into the distance, over the craters I saw the remains of the base, its rent, dejected white shell silently beckoning me. More and more light flooded in, and despite my predicament, I had only one thing on my mind. *At least Lucifer shut up in time for the earthrise.*",2016-11-02 02:06:16+00:00,d9hsj11,1.0,t3_5aipz0,49607.0,WritingPrompts

I had a dz until a few days ago (gutted it because it seemed out of place without a regular /d/), and I did change a few words from that *dz &gt; z. In addition, based on your response, it may be well to add /ɟ/, though I'll have to think about it. I'm starting to think now that /t͡ɬ/ may be from /kl/ or /tl/ or also shortened from a lost vowel, as it is rather out of place with regards to the other sounds. What kind of patterns do you suggest for naturalistic word generation? And should I add /d/, or is it reasonable to omit?

In addition, with regards to the vowels, I might make the inventory more varied if I can figure out a good way to differentiate /o/ and /ɔ/; I am not of the American dialect that differentiates between the two and, if you have any suggestions regarding that, I'd much appreciate it.

Anyway, I think the ""random friend requests"" may be a symptom of a virus rather than the virus itself. It may be advisable to wait a few days before accepting to see if you get any more and/or accept it on a public computer or something (to avoid getting a virus on your own stuff) and/or take off information you don't want random strangers or everyone to have before accepting. Doing some research on possible viruses may be a good idea, but it's possible that these are just random Philippine people that want to be your friend on Facebook.
