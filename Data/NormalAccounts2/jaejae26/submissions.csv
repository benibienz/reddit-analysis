He has been dating this girl for about 8 months. Its a steady sorta serious relationship. Only problem is when they hang out, she always brings her gay friend along. My brother doesn't have a problem with that kuz he's a cool chap but...... She pretty much ignores my brother and is entirely focused on the gay friend when they hang out.

Example: They went to Buffalo Wilds Wings last week just the three of them. What happens? My brother sits in silence, while they chat away about god knows what. He eventually got fed up and walked out.

Also, the gay kid is secretly bi are something. He does have a small taste for the kitty but pretends to be full blown gay.

He wants to know how to handle this situation. Does his chick have a crush on the bi kid? Is he overthinking it? Put his heart at ease please.

Her name is Daenerys Stormborn but I rarely called her by her name so you can call her whateves.

She's an amazing cuddler, socializer and loves giving bathes. Shes friendly with dogs too.

Shes about a year old and spayed.Â 

She needs someone who can handle her love kuz she gives and gives it hard.
