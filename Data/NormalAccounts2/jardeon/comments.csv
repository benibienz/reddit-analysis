This is a photo of the Atlas V 421 rocket lifting [NROL-61 to orbit](http://i.imgur.com/MOnHusg.jpg) on July 28, 2016 from Space Launch Complex 41, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida.

I've taken a number of engine closeup photos, but this was the first time I'd successfully exposed for the detail in the SRB plume.  The photo was shot using a Canon 40D and an 85mm f/1.8 short telephoto prime lens, somewhere between 400-500 feet from the rocket.  Exposure was ISO 100, f/11 at 1/4000.  No filters were used (fortunately, the lens's front glass didn't suffer any ill effects from the SRB exhaust at this launch, but I did have to [replace it](https://www.instagram.com/p/BKKFlobgqdh/) after [OSIRIS-REx](http://i.imgur.com/Eoj46A1.jpg)).

The launch was just after sunrise in late July, so some of the light hitting the rocket is from the sun illuminating the side facing the camera, but the bulk of the light in this photo is from the engines themselves.

23,"It's a little beyond my expertise to measure the danger level in a particular plan, what I could say is that the launch was a much, much riskier time for the shuttle than landing, with one notable exception in 2003.  But Columbia's disintegration on re-entry stemmed from damage it sustained on liftoff.  The design of the shuttle, particularly of the various forms of thermal protection systems (TPS: tiles, blankets, reinforced carbon-carbon) made re-entry from low-earth orbit based speeds as safe as it could, but the pressure generated from compressing the air in front of the body of the shuttle so rapidly meant there was little to no margin for error in the TPS on re-entry -- any hole, tear, imperfection could magnify danger to the point where the shuttle could be (and in that one instance, was) destroyed.

The wings actually have no purpose during launch, though, and the shuttle comes back with very little fuel (by design, they used all the SSME fuel at launch, and nearly all the OMS fuel on-orbit and for de-orbit).  A smaller version of the shuttle could have flown without those big delta wings (and will, check out Sierra Nevada's DreamChaser spacecraft).  The big wings were dictated by an Air Force requirement: 1,000 mile cross range capability.  By design, the shuttle could launch south out of Vandenberg Air Force Base in California into a polar orbit, deploy a sensitive payload in space over Russia, then return and land in California, all in one orbit.  The only problem is that the earth is spinning underneath the shuttle while it's doing that; one orbit later, California has moved a significant distance to the east!

So the 1,000 mile cross range meant that the shuttle could make its re-entry and steer/glide itself all the way back to California, counteracting the distance imparted by the rotation of earth itself.  In reality, the shuttles never flew polar orbits from California, and the wings were really only used during the shuttle big S-turns to bleed off speed on approach, if I remember correctly.  

But what you're mentioning above about the axis of entry; the shuttle was designed to re-enter from LEO speeds, and could not have survived a deep-space (or even far earth orbit / lunar orbit) re-entry, as the thermal systems would not have been up to the task of handling the additional heat generated by re-entry.

If you have some loose change in your pocket and want to learn a LOT more about the design, construction and operation of the Space Shuttle system, check out [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Space-Shuttle-National-Transportation-Missions/dp/0963397451/ref=sr_1_1)  Probably the thickest, most dense scientific/engineering overview of the whole process from beginning to operation.

25,"Two fuel lines, actually, one carrying liquid hydrogen, the other carrying liquid oxygen.  The solid booster casings, once all the propellant had been consumed, would be jettisoned and would parachute back down into the Atlantic ocean, where they would be recovered and towed back to port, then shipped to Thiokol in Utah to be inspected, refurbished, refilled with propellant, and then shipped back to Florida to be stacked and used on future flights.

The new SLS rocket NASA is building will use a variant of those boosters, but consisting of five segments instead of four, and without the parachutes (so no re-use for those).  The boosters being set up for it now are ones that were used near the end of the shuttle program.

The 3 SSME engines were saved and reused, though they'd be taken off the orbiter and fully refurbished after each flight.  The engines (generally speaking) are the most complex and expensive part of any launch system, so not throwing them away each time is an important point.  

After the 2 SRBs would be jettisoned, the shuttle would continue on its journey to orbit propelled by the three SSMEs, drawing its fuel from the orange external tank until it was empty.  At that point, the shuttle would be on a very long ballistic trajectory over the earth.  As the shuttle reached the top point of that arc, it would use the two OMS engines (the smaller ones mentioned before) to circularize its orbit and remain in space instead of falling back to the ground -- kind of like a third stage, although it doesn't really use the classic design, since the SRBs and SSMEs would be firing at the same time.

The timeline would look something like this:

T-0 to T+2.5 minutes: both Solid Rocket Boosters and three Space Shuttle Main Engines firing.
T+2.5 - T+8 SRBs jettisoned, three SSMEs firing.  Sometimes the OMS engines would be used in conjunction with the SSMEs to hit a target trajectory.

Following this there would be a coast period until the shuttle reached apogee, the highest point of its arc, at which time they would re-fire the OMS engines to raise the lowest point (perigee) and create a roughly circular orbit.

To re-enter the atmosphere and land, the shuttle would start with its engines pointing in the direction of its orbit (from our 2D perspective on earth, flying backwards), and fire those engines for a long enough period of time to cause their perigee to lower into earth's atomsphere, then they'd flip the shuttle back over and land it as an unpowered glider.",2016-11-11 00:58:47+00:00,d9v6nq6,4.0,t1_d9v1lts,6887.0,space
26,"I'm inclined to believe the EXIF data; the settings are just about right for the moon, as you said.  The shuttle would have been lit up by a series of powerful xenon spotlights while it was sitting on the launchpad.

If you were to open the f/4 up to f/2.8, you'd wind up taking the shutter speed to 1/320, and the ISO jump from 500 (Bill Ingall's photo above) and 800 (mine) is only 2/3 of a stop.

So it's definitely possible to do in a single exposure without compositing.",2016-11-10 22:05:12+00:00,d9uytcl,2.0,t1_d9uxccz,1766.0,space
27,"The majority of space on the Space Shuttle orbiter is the unpressurized cargo bay.  Check out this [cutaway drawing](http://www.charlesapple.com/uploads/2013/01/130201ShuttleCutaway.jpg) for a better picture.

The payload bay could carry pressurized crew modules, such as SpaceHab and SpaceLab, which expanded the overall living/working space onboard during those missions, but most missions flew with cargo in the bay, whether it was satellites or ISS construction components.  The Hubble Space Telescope was one of, if not the bulkiest payloads carried by the Space Shuttle, size-wise, it's comparable to a city bus, so if you picture the Space Shuttle carrying a bus in the payload bay, that should give you a sense of scale.

(Side note: only the Space Shuttle Columbia would have been able to retrieve Hubble and bring it back to Earth, which was originally planned to be done when the telescope had reached its end of life.  Columbia had its airlock integrated into the mid-deck, leaving the full volume of the cargo bay available for Hubble.  Every other orbiter in the fleet used an external airlock module, which was situated at the forward end of the payload bay; Hubble would not have fit on board Atlantis, Discovery or Endeavour.  This is also why Columbia never visited Mir or the ISS during its lifespan.)

The shuttle's forward section consisted of the flight deck and mid deck, which combined provided space for up to seven astronauts to travel to orbit and live there for up to two weeks.

In the rear, the smaller Orbital Maneuvering System engines had their hypergolic fuel cells, but the three massive Space Shuttle Main Engines were fueled by the orange external fuel tank.

30,"&gt; Else, I am curious why one doesn't just use photoshop instead of LR for MB? I'm quite OutOfTheLoop here

Lightroom is more than just editing photos, it's also cataloging -- being able to organize photos into collections, tag them, have them sorted by date, etc.  Plus, LR's edits are all non-destructive.  I can go back to an image I put in my catalog in 2006, undo all the edits on it, and re-edit it from RAW just as if I imported it today.  Even better, I can snapshot my adjustments, then roll back to the state where the photo was imported, then apply all new adjustments.  Then, with one click, I could just back to that snapshot if I didn't like the new adjustments.

I use a 2TB external RAID-1 array with a MacBook pro laptop.  Because of Lightroom's smart previews, I can still view, edit and (low-medium res) export my photos even when I'm not plugged into the external drive.  I wouldn't use the 128gb stick because of the failure rate of those memory chips on extensive read/write operations.

Occasionally I'll start a new catalog for an event I know I'm going to work on extensively for a short period of time, but then never need to look at again (like an anniversary party where I'm just going to hand off images and never go back to the event) but for all my personal photos I just keep one large catalog, which is currently pushing 40k images.

The main engines on the space shuttle (SSME) burned a mix of hydrogen and oxygen, which gives them a very clear-looking flame with very little plume -- look just aft of the orbiter, and notice the three small blue-white cones, with the purplish looking exhaust trailing behind.  Those are the SSMEs.

The shuttle stack also used two solid rocket boosters burning [APCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_perchlorate_composite_propellant) (aluminum, and some other stuff thrown in for good measure).  The SRB exhaust is what leaves that dirty, brown-looking cloud behind the shuttle.  The exhaust is also extremely caustic, converting to hydrochloric acid and eating away at things in its path (like camera lenses, fences, etc).  

In addition to the exhaust, the launchpad itself dumps 300,000 gallons of water onto the pad deck at liftoff, primarily to suppress the sound energy caused by the launch.  This water flashes to steam on contact with a heat source (five engines firing into it) and creates the whiter cloud of vapor near the base of the photo.

36,"The overall problem with a daytime long exposure photo is that while the rocket is overwhelmingly bright, when measured in the 3-ish minutes it takes to expose the full flight of the first stage, the surrounding sky has a greater chance to wash out the brilliance of the rocket.

I've only used film to shoot [remote launch photos](http://i.imgur.com/XMYVsdC.jpg) at the launchpad, I haven't yet photographed a long exposure on film.

This [3 minute exposure](https://www.flickr.com/photos/alloyjared/29563696015/in/album-72157673631083985/lightbox/) was shot about 30 minutes before sunset using a stack of three ND8 filters on a Canon 5D -- f/22 at ISO 100 for 3 minutes.  You can see that in the three minutes the shutter was open, even the diminished amount of light in the sky at sunset still almost completely overwhelms the trail of the rocket's flight.  Per /u/jeffk42 below, this also shows how a SRB exhaust plume shows up in a longer photo, in this case, wisping around the main streak.

The most successful daytime streak photos I've seen have been composite shots, leaving the shutter open for only 15-30 seconds at a time and compositing the finished frames in Photoshop or another image editing program.  The benefit to this method is that the overall sky remains darker relative to the rocket's streak, since the compositing method only overlays the extra portions of the rocket's flight, but doesn't multiply the amount of light in the sky.

When Morelos-3 was launched for the Mexican Ministry of Transportation, it was a commercial launch on Atlas V that was sold by Lockheed Martin.  It's kind of  splitting hairs, since LM owns 50% of ULA, but it was specifically stated that the commercial launches were sold by LM.

edit; found what I was looking for: ""Lockheed Martin Commercial Launch Services, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Lockheed Martin Corporation, markets the Atlas V to commercial satellite customers worldwide and also offers Athena launch services for small satellites and multi-payload RideShare missions.

61,"The RD-180 is a single engine, but it is made up of [two combustion chambers and two nozzles](http://i.imgur.com/02xsdNy.jpg).

The RD-181 is a single-chamber, single nozzle engine, and Antares uses two of them.

Basically, it starts with the RD-170, an engine made up of four combustion chambers and four nozzles (all sharing a single turbine and pump).  The RD-180 is a variant of that design, used exclusively by ULA's Atlas V.  If you think of it as a RD-170 cut in half, you'd be pretty close.

The RD-191 is a further variant of the RD-170, cutting it into quarters, so just one combustion chamber and nozzle.  The version of the RD-191 built for Orbital ATK is the RD-181, adapted for use on the Antares launch vehicle.  There are a couple of other versions of the RD-191, intended for use by South Korea (RD-151) and Russia's Soyuz-2.1v launcher (RD-193).

When I had the chance to ask an Orbital ATK rep about this all last December, the word was that they'd have liked to use the RD-180, but NPO Energomash's contract for that particular design is exclusive to ULA.  While the RD-181 wasn't exactly a drop-in replacement for the older NK-33/AJ-26 engines used by the Antares 130 rocket, the two engine design was a close fit, since the rocket is plumbed for two connections (one for each engine), something that would have been a bigger modification for a single engine like the RD-180.

150,"Bear in mind I don't work for NASA, I just have the benefit of being able to access facilities like KSC through their media accreditation process.  Anything I could really offer at this point isn't anything more than my own speculation.

Allowing the press access to NASA facilities is a delicate balancing act; in order to receive public money, NASA's story needs to reach the largest scope of people possible.  But because NASA is a government agency, they don't have limitless funds or personnel to handle the entire horde of people interested in space who might otherwise descend on KSC, so press accreditation exists to attempt to balance the limited number of media representatives NASA has against the widest possible audience that they can reach.

And because NASA is a government agency, change comes slowly, if at all.  The NASA Social program is a great example of NASA relaxing their previously stringent rules to reach out to a larger audience.  For most NASA launches, a pool of 50 people active on various social networks are accepted and given press-level access to the missions, and people behind those missions, to help spread NASA's story.  For anyone 18+ who's active on social media, this is the absolute best way to get an up-close look at what's going on in the US space program.

But NASA still have to contend with things like ITAR restrictions, contractor/vendor relations, etc.  For example, in order to allow us into the Thermal Protection System Facility last year, large sections of the building had to be screened off, and a protective layer of escorts were strung around us to ensure that the only things we saw were those that NASA had approved for external release.  Just to allow 36 journalists in the building for a couple of hours would have severely hampered their ability to get work done for a two day period.

All this means that the number of people coming out to cover a launch is always going to be constrained to some extent, because the press isn't allowed to just freely wander around an active launch facility.  If their rules require extra overhead for those under 18, and they don't have the manpower on hand to cover it, then the normal government stance falls back to saying ""no.""  Whether it's right or wrong, it's the current state of affairs.  For a while, those rules had been relaxed, and NASA was allowing younger people in; as of late, it has changed back the other way.  I don't have any concrete explanation as to why, but the rumor mill says that one of the younger credentialed members of the press did something irresponsible, and so the rule was re-evaluated and raised back to 18 years old.",2016-09-05 18:16:55+00:00,d7ai88g,5.0,t1_d7ahazu,1448.0,ula

There are two likely reasons that credentials based on age are enforced at KSC.  The first is that the accreditation process for minors, when it was previously permitted, was more stringent, requiring multiple badges (both a press overlay and a badge issued by KSC Security) and, on paper at least, an appointed public affairs escort for the minor at all times.  

The second is that media access to KSC involves signing one or two contractual documents governing your behavior while on the property and your willingness to turn over devices/footage to NASA in the case of a mishap.

194,"So, I shoot all my rocket photos in full-manual mode.  For evenly-exposed photos, my biggest concern is using a fast enough shutter speed that the vibrations caused by the launch don't introduce camera motion blur into the photos.  So shutter speeds of 1/500 or faster are generally required.

That pairs up pretty well with an aperture of f/5.6 or f/8 when shooting near ISO 200 (I usually shoot ISO 160 and let the camera give me the grain/noise of ISO 200 but perform a 1/3 stop reduction in the light the sensor is receiving.

For this really bright exposure, based on my previous attempts, I made a couple of changes.  I stopped the lens down to f/11, meaning it was taking in half as much light as it would receive at f/8, and then I bumped my shutter speed up to 1/4000, where each step from 1/500 to 1/1000 to 1/2000 to 1/4000 reduced the amount of light reaching the sensor by half.  The relationship between aperture and shutter speed is connected, so I could have shot at f/16 and 1/2000 or f/22 and 1/1000 with similar results, but I've been happy with the depth of field at f/11 and I wanted to be 100% certain that the solid rockets weren't going to bounce my camera around to the point of blurring the shot at a slower shutter speed.

196,"Close enough that the sound would kill me if I stood there during a launch.  

But the pad engineers have done a good job of making sure that all the violence of the launch gets directed into a specific area (out the flame duct, up the berm, and out to the Atlantic Ocean).  What this means for cameras is that we only need to protect against specific threats:

* Florida weather.  Cameras need to be protected against likely afternoon / evening rain storms.
* Environmental heat.  Cameras need to be protected against overheating from sitting out in direct sun.
* Solid Rocket Booster exhaust.  This caustic junk can and will eat the front of your lens (I've lost two or three this way already).  While the flame duct does a good job of projecting the majority of the exhaust in one specific direction, when the prevailing winds are 5+mph, the exhaust can blow back onto lenses and camera bodies, and either pit or strip them, leading to a trashed lens.
* Flying debris.  At the MUOS-5 launch, chunks of the cement in the flame duct came loose and were projected at high speed into the earthen berm protecting the nitrogen tanks.  When the concrete struck this berm, it went airborne, smacked into the pad perimeter road, broke into chunks and went flying into the tripods and housings of cameras belonging to my colleagues.  Additionally, on launches with heavy payloads, I've seen the backwash from the engine exhaust topple cameras/tripods that aren't staked down properly.

For protection, I house my cameras inside white plastic lidded boxes, with a hole cut out to shoot through.  This gives me enough room to hold a camera, sound trigger and dew heater controller (for overnight/early morning launches).  The box protects against almost everything except for exhaust hitting the lens, which is mostly countered by looking at wind forecasts and setting up so that you're not downwind of the launchpad at T-0.

At the NROL-37 Delta IV Heavy launch, the rocket set all the grass around the launchpad on fire, and when I came back, the force of liftoff had blown the lid off my camera station, shot the trigger out the back (in three pieces) and deformed the rest of the box from the extreme heat of being near a grassfire.  Unfortunately, that was a film camera and it didn't have a high enough capacity battery to stay powered on up until the launch, so all that devastation didn't even yield me a usable picture.",2016-08-10 21:20:58+00:00,d6cdd0q,5.0,t1_d6ccx03,579.0,space

Those are the times when it might be better to [recompose a wider shot](http://i.imgur.com/GUL0ChQ.jpg), and take in more of the surroundings.  

If you can lock in some sharp focus, though, then having a fast shutter speed is what's going to help prevent blurring, whether you're on a tripod or not -- and if you are on a tripod and fighting wind, remove the neckstrap from the camera, it acts like a giant sail.

For the launch itself, I almost always have one shot on a tripod, and another body hand-held.  If it's a night launch, the tripod has the camera with the widest angle lens I can get my hands on (for the [long exposure streak shot](http://i.imgur.com/bFIt6VV.jpg)) and I'm [hand-holding a long lens with image stabilization](http://i.imgur.com/6OKigiI.jpg).

249,"My [first book](http://wereportspace.com/book) just came out [in stores](https://amzn.com/1615470433) this month, so I can offer a bit of insight.

I'll freely admit that I was luckier than most, in that I found a publisher without really having to go through the whole process of pitching my book and jumping through a lot of hoops -- the book is published by a company which primarily specializes in Microsoft Excel tutorials, but twice a year they open up to specialty publications that may sell well outside the MS Excel space.

I had originally envisioned a coffee table book, in hard cover, with thick paper stock, but the realities of price and the scope of just how many copies we thought we might be able to sell scaled us back a bit; the tradeoff being that while the book is softcover, and printed on trade paper, it's also much more affordable (a hardcover book would have to sell for about $60, but our paperback sits at $19.95) and we were able to do a smaller print run, here in the US, so we wouldn't be sitting on a mountain of unsaleable $60 hardcover books sent via containership from China.

Having a smaller page count in mind will help you to ensure that only the very best shots make it into the book.  Our printer works in batches of 32 pages, so we had a choice to do 160, 192 or 224 pages; by selecting to create a 160 page book, we were forced to make hard decisions about what to include, and the book is better for it.

There's a long-lead time involved in the process.  I submitted our first book via the publisher to the distributor in June 2015, finalized the content around December / January, had a hard deadline to be at the printer's by April, and was on store shelves just before June 1 2016.  So if you're looking to publish something super-timely, keep in mind that ""timely"" in the book industry could be 1-2 years.

My publisher offered one bit of particularly useful advice.  If anyone asks you for money to publish your book, run.  They're not a serious publisher, they're a vanity press.  His other piece of useful advice was, ""when Amazon starts to send you emails inviting you to pre-order your own book, it's probably time to start writing it.""",2016-06-29 15:15:23+00:00,d4smjet,1.0,t3_4qd35j,48436.0,photography

The goal of the NASA Social program isn't to walk away with cool pictures (though it is a nice side benefit), it's to share the NASA story on social channels where it might not already be getting attention.  

A launch social is more than just the launch.  We were taken on tours of the Launch Control Center, Vehicle Assembly Building, Launch Abort Test Facility (where we saw actual Orion hardware), we were present at LC-39A for the SpaceX lease agreement signing (and met Bob Cabana, Charlie Bolden and Gwynne Shotwell).  We got to have hands-on time with some of the mission experiments going to station (including eating some of the VEGGIE lettuce).  

The SpaceX CRS-4 social group got to tour Launch Complex 39B, and go inside ULA's Horizontal Integration Facility to see the Delta IV Heavy booster (for EFT-1) up close.

If you have a social audience, or if you've got an interesting way to share the NASA story, then you absolutely should apply.

Since this was in Florida in June, the temperature never dropped below about 75, even on the overnight, so I don't think it's a case of cold weather killing the battery.

It's really no different no matter who the launch provider or space agency is, though.  NASA allowed media into the Thermal Protection System Facility only after blocking off visibility of about half the building; when we get access to places like the Operations &amp; Checkout building, we're strictly escorted into the high bay, and forbidden from taking any photos outside of designated areas.  Boeing expressed the same restriction inside the C3PF (formerly OPF-3), even for things as benign as empty rooms.

It's a game we all play in order to keep the access we do have -- apparently there were some miscreants before my time who've compromised our access to certain other buildings and facilities, by not abiding by those rules.

340,"The short version of the answer goes something like this:

* Any official photo released by SpaceX has been vetted by their media/public affairs team, after having been scrutinized to ensure no ITAR-protected information is communicated in the image.  
* Any photo taken and published by a member of the media has been done so under tightly controlled circumstances (for instance, the return of F9-024 where all nine engines had covers installed, and a tarp was wrapped around the octaweb structure).
* There may be undisclosed differences between a pre-launch and post-landing engine, which could include proprietary information.

It's not just SpaceX who have such restrictions.  When we (media) were invited to Wallops Island in December to view the reconstruction after ORB-3, and see the upgraded RD-181 engines in the hangar, we were given strict instruction that no telephoto pictures could be taken or released of the RD-181 engines (engine bells and plumbing included).

404,"Two years ago, I applied for and was selected to attend the SpaceX CRS-3 NASA Social event, due to my activity on social networks.  At the time, I didn't use Facebook, Instagram or Twitter, so my selection was largely due to the fact that my social network of choice was Reddit.

Over the course of three launch delays, I met a number of amazing people, including fellow redditor /u/mseeley1 (the guy capturing all those great shots of the Falcon 9 returning to Port Canaveral) as well as Bill Jelen, the brains behind the [Mr. Excel](http://mrexcel.com) empire.  At separate times, we each found ourselves recruited by SpaceFlight Insider to act as photographers, videographers and writers following our time at the SpaceX CRS-3 launch, which enabled us to continue coming out to cover launches &amp; other special events at Cape Canaveral and Kennedy Space Center.  But we were finding that our pictures would get just a burst of attention right around a launch, then the news cycle would take over and people would lose interest.  So we put our heads together on how we could share more of the photos we were capturing.

It turns out that Mr. Excel is a book publisher, and loved the idea of doing a full-color launch photo book, and from that, We Report Space was born.  Our involvement with the media pool at KSC and CCAFS meant that we were on hand to witness &amp; photograph the launch failure of **CRS-7**, as well as the triumphant return to flight (and return to launch site landing) of SpaceX during **Orbcomm OG2-M2**.  We've shared a number of those pictures here, through /r/spacex, and now they've all been collected into a full color book documenting Florida rocket launches from April 2014-December 2015.  

What really makes this book awesome, though, is that it's not just pictures of rockets lifting off.  We've also collected essays from other NASA Social participants on their experiences, both in attending the event, as well as the impact it has had on their lives afterwards.  If you've followed my account here for any length of time, you know I'm a pretty serious cheerleader for the NASA Social program, because it really is the best answer to ""how can I get as close as possible to a rocket launch?""

The book is [available through our website](http://wereportspace.com/shop), and we're offering some specials right now that bundle the book with 8x10 prints of rocket launches (including three very nice SpaceX Falcon 9 photos) and free shipping in the US.  If you buy direct from our website, we'll fulfill your order right away.  If you're outside the US, you can order the book through [Amazon.com](http://amzn.com/1615470433) or [Barnes &amp; Noble](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/we-report-space-jared-haworth/1122805012), and it'll ship June 1st.

Of course, We Report Space will continue to cover launches out of Cape Canaveral and Kennedy Space Center, and we'll continue to share those pictures here as we take them.  The support of the /r/spacex community &amp; moderation team has been invaluable in helping us to get the word out that human spaceflight didn't end with the Space Shuttle program.

You can also follow us on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/wereportspace) and [Facebook](http://facebook.com/wereportspace) to stay up to date with all the launches &amp; other spaceflight-related events we're covering.",2016-05-13 14:56:13+00:00,d3434d8,1.0,t3_4j6ow3,10.0,spacex

408,"The ""AI at War"" logic seemed kind of shaky to me.  I declared war on a neighbor because he broke up my empire (built a frontier outpost that split my only hyperlane between halves of my territory). 

His fleet outclassed mine, so after I lost all my offensive ships, he made a beeline for my capital world and bombarded it, but couldn't bring enough troops to land against my defensive armies.

He left every other part of my empire alone, just kept bombarding my capital, and occasionally sending a single embarked army (about once every two months) which was immediately slaughtered by my defensive troops.

Since he left all my mining stations and THREE OTHER SPACEPORTS unharmed, I was able to rebuild my entire fleet twice, and he never once came after me.  I started to engage in ""hit and run"" raids against his systems, which drew him off my homeworld, and when he lost one pitched battle against me, he proposed a white peace, despite having had me at -55% warscore.

What's worse, his empire is ""Hive Mind"" but he's never shown the slightest problem with me boxing him into a tiny corner of the galaxy.  He's launched no wars of conquest against me, and hasn't tried to take a single one of my systems (after that one frontier outpost just outside my space).",2016-05-11 18:52:04+00:00,d31noxk,1.0,t3_4iv2fb,17022.0,Stellaris

We also received a full tour of the ship, top to bottom, stem to stern, from the volunteers running the foundation, which was really cool.  This was even before the engine was removed for renovation -- I can remember having to climb down a pretty rickety ladder into the engine room to see it.

I actually lived in Boston while the Nobska was in Dry Dock 1, but didn't have the opportunity to continue volunteering with the NESF.  They were certainly given plenty of notice about needing to remove Nobska from the dry dock (it was no secret that USS Constitution would need to dry dock to prepare for her ~~bicentennial~~ (my timing is wrong here, but I recall at the time that there was a big to-do about USS Constitution's restoration)), but were unable to raise the funds to relocate her.  There were also some shenanigans done in the foundations name that harmed the overall restoration effort, and in the end, nothing more could be done.

The view in your link above, because it was broadcast live, is most likely a video camera, where the E-8 camera was recording everything on film, which was retrieved from the launchpad after the rocket was long gone.  The tradeoff for using video was that you'd have a much lower quality, but you'd have it instantaneously for broadcast, so the camera would not necessarily have to survive launch (though it's kind of a waste to destroy a camera every time).

456,"Launch date planning is very fluid.  The farther away a launch date is scheduled, the more likely it is to move.  The dates tend to firm up as you get closer.  Since we're now in early April, I'd more or less trust dates up to about the end of May.  However, anything can happen.  ULA just recently delayed the planned launch of the Atlas V rocket bearing MUOS-5, due to an unexpected issue with the OA-6 launch in March.  MUOS-5 has moved from ""May 12"" to ""indefinite"" as a result.

The CRS-9 date was likely picked based on the launch date of CRS-8, which had moved from March 31 to April 4 to April 8 about 2-3 weeks ago.  Moving CRS-8 9 days back on the schedule probably triggered moving CRS-9 as well.

And even once you're on-site, there's a good chance that weather or unforseen issues can delay a mission by days or even weeks.  I traveled to Florida to watch the SpaceX CRS-3 launch in mid-March 2014.  It was delayed by two weeks, two days before launch due to contamination from a sewing machine.  That two weeks stretched two weeks further when an Air Force radar tracking station caught fire.  Then, the rocket made it to T-60 minutes to launch when it was scrubbed due to a helium leak, which took 5 days to find and resolve.  Planning a vacation around a launch can be an exercise in futility.  Not to say it can't be done, just that it demands a certain amount of flexibility.  The only good news I can give is that launches almost never move earlier on the calendar, only later.",2016-04-12 01:27:54+00:00,d1z919a,3.0,t1_d1z82yi,1410.0,rocketlaunches

458,"The urge to fiddle is pretty strong.  It's countered by the fact that we can't just drive out there when we feel like it.  We're generally given one hour, under escort &amp; guard, to set up as much as we can, then we're taken away again.  If there's a scrub, and the launch service provider is feeling generous, they'll let us go out before the next attempt to reformat memory cards, replace batteries, and wipe condensation off lenses.  It doesn't always happen, though.

Same-day setups are great.  A day or two before leaves me with too much time to wonder if I set everything just right, if I remembered to turn the sound trigger on, if the batteries will survive, etc.

The housing is less ""blastproof"" and more ""slightly rain proof.""  Keeps the majority of Florida weather off the camera body.  $5 from Walmart/Target.

461,"Essentially that's what happens, although with a 32gb memory card, the camera stops long before the card fills up, I don't have the exact number handy just now, but I doubt the camera takes more than 50 exposures (I'm shooting at 3 frames per second to prevent overwhelming the camera buffer).

Focus is set manually, I use the Live View preview on the back of the camera, a Canon 40D, to ensure I'm as sharply focused as I can get.  Once the focus is set, I tape down the focus ring with a piece of gaffer's tape.  I've had it shake out of focus through either handling the camera to reset after a launch scrub, or the liftoff itself shaking the camera out of focus, so the tape helps.

I was full-manual on the settings, not aperture priority.  I knew from experience that a daytime launch would call for settings near f/8, 1/800 and ISO 200.  I chose f/8, 1/1000 and ISO 160 to try and expose for the engines + the fact that the sun would be shining into the camera.  Looking at the end result, I almost could have dropped another 2/3 stop somewhere and been happy.  

I composed the shot to leave room for the rocket to fly fairly high in the frame, the version here is actually a horizontal crop of a vertical photo (seconds later: https://www.flickr.com/photos/alloyjared/26056156390/in/album-72157666411086140/).

Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) and 41 (SLC-41) were both built in the 1960s to support Titan III launches.  At that time, the US Air Force also built a Vertical Integration Building (VIB) and Solid Motor Assembly Building (SMAB) to process the rockets prior to launch.  Later, when Titan IV came along, SMAB wasn't large enough to handle the bigger SRBs, so the SMARF was built along the rail tracks leading from SMAB to the launch pads.

After Titan was retired (about 10 years ago now), the complexes were leased out to SpaceX (40, Falcon 9) and United Launch Alliance (41, Atlas V), and the VIB was demolished.  The SMAB and SMARF still stand, and SpaceX is actually leasing space inside SMAB for payload processing in one of the clean rooms.

So, it's possible one or more of these was reflecting light (or ignited itself) and that's what is visible in the video.

507,"Two years ago, I was selected to be a part of the NASA Social program, for the SpaceX CRS-3 resupply launch. Part of the agreement in getting Social Media credentials include sharing NASA's story on my own social channels. At the time, I had created a number of photographs tying NASA and spaceflight into my interests in kite flying, board gaming, building LEGO sets, and playing video games (Kerbal Space Program in particular). That trip turned into an opportunity to make additional trips to Kennedy Space Center to cover additional launches, and I'm always looking for new ways to promote NASA and spaceflight, outside the normal ""space-focused"" channels. 

Last week, during the launch of the Orbital ATK OA-6 resupply mission to the International Space Station, my schedule had about 4 hours of downtime between press conferences and the launch itself, so I had the chance to set up and do a little recording session, from the grounds of Kennedy Space Center. Planning ahead, I had brought my 1945 Conn 10M tenor and some recording gear, with the hope of being able to share a little bit of NASA with the saxophone community!

I could think of no more fitting combination of song &amp; location than Fly Me to the Moon, from the one location on earth where humans have, well, literally flown to the moon!

508,"From that year, one of the largest determinators of price will be whether the saxophone is low pitch or high pitch.  Low pitch instruments are tuned to A=440hz, which allowed them to be used with modern instruments, a high pitch instrument will be difficult or impossible to tune to others around you in a band/orchestra setting.  This leads to the prices for high pitch instruments being much lower, as their utility is limited.

For a Conn alto, look just below the serial number, for a letter ""L"" or ""H"" which would indicate low or high pitch, respectively.

I have a silver-plated 1924 Conn New Wonder alto (low pitch) which I bought on eBay a couple of years ago for $450 -- it needed about $50 of regulation work after I received it.  I felt like I got a pretty good deal, so this should give you a real-world price point for what a good condition Conn Alto from the 1920s might sell for.",2016-03-28 15:58:45+00:00,d1gg1xy,1.0,t3_4c8gg0,47478.0,saxophone

The fact that these used to be ""tweetups"" means that most people think that a NASA Social is primarily about having a lot of followers on Twitter, but really, being able to reach areas that aren't already well covered is the key.  At CRS-3, we had some people who primarily used Instagram, some who were very active on Pinterest and Etsy, and some who really only posted photos on Flickr.

The key is that each application is individually screened by NASA's Social Media team, so rather than letting your twitter account, FB page, instagram feed, etc speak for itself, you should use the provided box to sell yourself to the NASA Social team.  Use that area to explain how you're going to bring them coverage in an area that might not already be discussing NASA.  ",2016-03-18 18:19:58+00:00,d14soc9,3.0,t1_d14sia0,233.0,spacex

I also love that right after they quote Mike Landguth in saying ""customers don't like the unknown,"" the very next thing he says is that they'll occasionally offer discounts based on which lots are filling up, so the central parking deck could wind up cheaper than the usual $12.

The tradeoff is that you have access to all the other exhibits and amenities of the visitor complex, though, which means you're not just sitting in the bleachers for hours waiting to see something.

But, for other missions, they've opened up other viewing locations, some for free, others for a premium price.  During CRS-7, they offered free launch viewing from the Saturn V center, which does have a direct line of site, and offered viewing from the LC-39 Gantry for an added fee (something like $50 more than regular admission, but you get a T-shirt, a light snack, and the closest viewing point possible).  

Those aren't offered for every launch though, so the thing to do is keep an eye on KSC's website, and watch for a launch viewing announcement in the next week or so (assuming they hold to the April 8th date).",2016-03-18 00:18:01+00:00,d13y8xf,5.0,t1_d13vijv,4562.0,spacex

1) From Orlando, you'll be able to see the rocket lift off if you're looking toward the East at the right time :)

2) Travel to Titusville or Cape Canaveral.  Since CRS-8 is now scheduled during daylight hours, the closest point to watch from would be Playalinda Beach.  Show up early, pay $5 per car to get into the Canaveral National Seashore, park at Access 1 and walk about a mile south.  There's no closer publicly accessible place to see this launch, but if $5 is too much, you can watch from free from Port Canaveral, Jetty Park, the 528 Beachline, or the Indian River shoreline in Titusville.

3) Kennedy Space Center will offer one or more of the following:  Launch viewing from the visitor center; Launch viewing from the Saturn V center; Launch viewing from the LC-39 Gantry; Launch viewing from the NASA causeway.  I've listed those in roughly the order you'd want to choose them, from least to greatest.  KSC Visitor Complex will announce which of these are available as the launch date gets closer.

4) If you're 18+ years old and a US Citizen, keep an eye on http://www.nasa.gov/connect/social/index.html to see if they open a NASA Social event for CRS-8.  This is by far the best way to come see a launch, because you'll be granted press credentials to attend briefings, see the rocket up close, and watch the launch from the NASA causeway.

571,"It's surprisingly safe for cameras out there.  I've lost two (three really, but I saved one by replacing the front element) lenses in almost 2 years of shooting launches, had one trigger PCB get so corroded from solid rocket exhaust it no longer works, but never (yet) lost a camera body.

The biggest culprits for damage are:

1) Solid rocket exhaust, which can be mitigated by either shooting Falcon 9 launches (no solids) or keeping your cameras upwind of the rocket.

2) Flying debris.  I lost a lens at the GPS IIF-12 launch, which was an Atlas V 401 (no solids) when the front glass wound up getting essentially sandblasted by dirt &amp; sand kicked up by the rocket as it was lifting off.  I had placed that camera in a pretty close location, though (less than 100 feet from the flame duct) so the loss wasn't a surprise.

3) Water.  Depending on the launch service provider and whether or not the launch is scrubbed, we may set up as early as 72 hours before the launch.  I've come back to find lenses swimming in water from being exposed to Florida weather for the better part of a week.

We also mitigate the financial loss by using cheaper, older gear.  Most of my cameras are Canon 40D bodies (now about 10 years old) and I generally use junky kit lenses, so if damage happens, I haven't destroyed a multi-thousand dollar L-series lens.

In some cases, it's a creative crop.  That's the case for any of mine that appear to follow the rocket up.  

There are other photographers out there who've built custom tracking motors to attempt to follow the rocket.  The general logic is that if the rocket engine is the brightest thing out there, you use a photosensitive receptor combined with a motor to follow whatever that bright object is.  I think all the ones I've seen so far only pitch up and down, and occasionally, they get confused by the sun.

Other photographers choose to tie their microphones into timers, so that the mic is only listening at certain times, which allows them to choose a much greater sensitivity, since they don't have to worry about filling up the memory card with shots just because a forklift drove by (had this happen to me last year).",2016-02-24 21:01:33+00:00,d0cevml,4.0,t1_d0cdlr9,1671.0,spacex

At that point, what you mostly have is a lot of smoke/steam/exhaust...

But, since the sound triggers will continue to listen, as long as the trigger &amp; camera batteries don't die during the scrub, they'll continue to function through multiple attempts.  So a 90 minute window, which may or may not have 3 attempts in it, could potentially capture an ignition, followed by a scrub, followed by a second ignition and launch.",2016-02-24 18:00:42+00:00,d0c6njr,4.0,t1_d0c58um,1857.0,spacex

Which will allow you to keep the shutter open for long periods of time without getting star trails, or as /u/almathden says, shoot multiple exposures and use a program like Deep Sky Stacker to combine them into a single image.  DSS will align the stars in your images, and by taking multiple shots (and if you want to get really professional, take ""dark"" shots (e.g., same duration, but with the lenscap covering the lens) and flat or bias shots as well, the DSS program will be able to identify which parts of the image are stars, which are noise, and which are stuck or hot pixels, and reduce everything down to a much cleaner file, by removing things that aren't stars from your final image.",2016-02-23 17:09:20+00:00,d0ariaq,1.0,t3_4759qv,40450.0,Lightroom

589,"I've suggested them in other threads, but I really like the Hal Leonard playalong series.  You get lead sheets in C, Bb, Eb and bass clef, and a CD of backing tracks to go along with it.  There's basically books for any flavor of jazz you like, whether it's earlier, big band stuff, bebop, or later jazz fusion or more rock-inspired jazz.

/u/manofsax94 recommends the Aebersold books too, which are also good, if you're looking to get right into playing music, Volume 54 (Maiden Voyage) and Volume 70 (Killer Joe) are both geared toward people getting started, so the chord changes aren't insane and the melodies are pretty straightforward.

Basically, with the Aebersold books, you get a tune where the head and the solo chorus use the same chords, so you'll get a recording where the backing band runs through the same chord progression 7-10 times, so you do a couple plays through the head, solo for a few choruses, then come back and finish out with the melody again.

The Hal Leonard books are a little different, they don't include *quite* as much time for working on improvisation, but the tradeoff is that the play-along CDs from those books include 2 tracks for each song, one which is just a straight backing track (rhythm section) and one which has a lead instrument playing the melody -- helpful if you're a piano, bass or guitar player looking to play along with a melody, but also useful for sax players if you're unfamiliar with the song or the articulation, giving you a chance to hear how it's supposed to be played.

The launch itself is only a few seconds of terror as far as the camera is concerned, the biggest hazards seem to be 1) leaving the cameras out for 24-72 hours prior to launch in Florida weather and 2) caustic chemicals released by solid rocket boosters.  I've lost two and a half lenses to solid rocket exhaust (the half was my 85mm prime lens, I was able to replace the front glass for 25% of the cost of a whole new lens).  We use gear that's more or less considered disposable for this, though.  Most of what we put out there are older model bodies (mine are all Canon 40D cameras, which are now 11ish years old) and kit lenses (I use a Canon 18-55 and a Sigma 28-80).  The replacement cost on a Sigma kit lens is about $20, which makes it cheaper to replace the lens than buying a high quality multicoated filter.

The most recent east coast launch (GPS IIF-12) cost me a Sigma lens, because I placed it up close to the flame trench, and the exhaust kicked up a bunch of sandy soil which essentially sandblasted and pitted the front of my lens.  On the whole, though, I've been shooting launches with remote cameras since September 2014 and my only casualties have been those 2.5 lenses -- all the bodies have held up just fine.  Being a little more cautious about how close I place gear, and watching where the prevailing winds will blow the exhaust is protection enough most of the time.  

As far as getting access, what I always tell people is to apply for NASA Social.  Posting on Reddit definitely counts as a social network for NASA's criteria (when I was chosen, I only used Reddit and Flickr, no Twitter, FB or Instagram for me).  That's what initially got me out there, and members of the NASA social are generally given the same access as the traditional media (sometimes they even get to see things the traditional media does not, such as the social-only tour of LC-39B at KSC during CRS-4).  At prior launches, NASA Social members have been permitted to set remote cameras at the launchpad, and (space permitting) view the launch from the roof of the VAB.

All NASA wants in return is that you do what you're already doing, talk up NASA on social media channels.  It's a great program.",2016-02-19 16:12:32+00:00,d05ytd9,3.0,t1_d05wlp4,3253.0,space

I've never bricklinked myself, so I went and followed your link to see how I might buy an R2D2 figure.  As a first-time visitor to Bricklink, I'd probably have done exactly what your quoted section above says.  Finding the store terms or splash page are links that look like site-wide navigation, not specific to the store.  It's bad user interface design, in that as a first time visitor, I didn't see any easy way to tell what the specific store terms would be.  If I found a part I wanted, the funnel is optimized to get me to put that item in my cart and buy it, without seeing any of the ancillary terms.

However, not having something to play wasn't a problem.  When I used to play, the internet was still in pre-Netscape territory.  There were no online sheet music or backing track repositories, no YouTube to watch other performances, no Amazon to get gear easily or quickly.  

After a few months of just kind of randomly picking up pieces of music and messing around, I realized what I really wanted from music was playing with other people.  So I got a bit serious and signed up for lessons.  The nice thing about being out for 20 years is I managed to forget a lot of the bad habits I developed when I was a younger player.

NASA Social applications usually open about a month in advance of NASA-specific launches, so there should be one opening soon, for the SpaceX CRS-8 launch attempt in February.

736,"Thank you!

Yes, it's been a bit of trial and error to get to this point, the first few Atlas V launches with solid rocket boosters I was a bit overexposed because of the giant amount of light being pumped out by those engines.  My first couple of times I shot in Aperture priority and let the camera determine the shutter speed, now I go fully manual for these shots.  Light falloff definitely comes into play, and the closer I get to the rocket, the further I have to stop down the lens and shorten the shutter speed.  At 1,000 feet, f/8 and 1/1000 at ISO 160 was OK, but from 500 feet away, I had to turn to f/11 and ISO 100 (still 1/1000), because I'm that much closer to the light source.

737,"filters are an option, but they bring two other challenges/problems.

The first is ghosting, adding another layer of glass (and especially cheap glass) between the image sensor and the rocket can lead to some pretty ugly lens flare.

The second is condensation.  Since we leave the cameras outside for anywhere from 8 hours to about a week (thanks, OA-4), there are a lot of issues with condensation forming, and I've seen on more than one occasion a lens get moisture trapped between the filter and the lens glass front itself.  

So, leaving the lenses naked is a calculated risk to try and capture better photos.  Using cheap lenses is the other option.  Most of the ones I place out there are junk kit lenses, like the Canon 18-55 non IS, and a Sigma 28-80 that came with my original Rebel G in 2002.  The 85mm prime I use for engine shots, like this one: https://www.flickr.com/photos/alloyjared/16541345381/in/album-72157650761484212/ or this one: https://www.flickr.com/photos/alloyjared/19950881916/in/album-72157656310329745/",2015-12-21 20:09:43+00:00,cy6xn84,6.0,t1_cy6xi7z,212.0,spacex

739,"I forgot to ask if it was opposite day out there.  

For this launch, we were met by SpaceX public affairs employees at a location outside Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, and transported to SLC-40 by bus, while being watched over by SpaceX PAOs and SpaceX private security.  We were allowed to set up in an area that was about 500 feet long by 100 feet deep, outside the launchpad perimeter fence.  We could not walk past the flame trench, or around by the main access gate.  So, when I say we weren't allowed near LZ-1, it's because we were carefully managed throughout the entire process.  Deviating from our escorts would be grounds for not only getting thrown out for this launch, but being denied access in the future.  It's their game, and we have to play by their rules.

Others, such as Zero G News, will also bring upwards of a dozen cameras, a mix of Mobius, GoPro, and DSLR units.

Heat isn't an issue for where we set up, we're outside the pad perimeter fence.  Again, for Delta, we get much closer in, and those that we place right under the rocket have seen some heat effects; mostly, if someone is just using a garbage bag for protection, the bag will melt to the camera.

For my stations, and for the group cameras that SFI places, we use plastic bins for protection from the elements.  Rain is the biggest worry, followed by solid rocket exhaust.

As a practical point, make sure you allow yourself some extra days in the schedule in case the launch slips -- out of our group of 50 selected for CRS-3 last year, 37 made it to the first launch attempt, 20 were able to come back for the second, and only 8 were able to stay until it finally launched.

I saw the same thing happen with CRS-4, when it was scrubbed for 24 hours, more than half the attendees at the NASA Social ended up missing it because they had only planned on staying long enough for the initial launch window.

* Is it a NW2 (nailfile G# key, slightly better build quality than the 1st generation New Wonders)?
* What's the finish?  Silver plate, gold plate, lacquer, bare brass?  
* What's the mechanical condition?  Has the maintenance been kept up on it?  Is there noise in the action?  Play in the keys?  Are the pads in good shape or do they need replacing?  Are there any leaks?  How about the tube, any dents?
* Where are you planning on selling it?  Selling saxophones (in good shape) to saxophonists could bring you a higher price than trying to sell on Craigslist or eBay, though if you've got a rare horn, you might want the greater visibility of a site like eBay.

I'm no expert in appraising these (though if /u/fixessaxes drops by, he could likely offer a professional opinion based on answers to the above).

All I can say (with any certainty) is I paid about $450 for my NW1 alto, and spent about $50 at my tech having him address any issues that came up from it being shipped.  History says the NW1 is less desirable than the NW2/Chu Berry, so the NW2 might pull a higher price.  The thing working against you is that there was about a 10 year run of NW2 saxes (prior to the transition into the 6M line), and Conn made A LOT of them.  

You can look for saxophones similar to yours on eBay in the ""Sold"" category to get a general idea what to ask -- likewise, you could also look at what professional sax shops are asking for similar models, but bear in mind that any place that's specializing in selling vintage horns is also building in the cost of having the horn fully overhauled before placing it up for sale, so while you might see some seriously high prices over at getasax.com (and you will), their business model is to sell horns in top condition to people willing to pay for top condition horns.

830,"Not the external door, the shuttle stack on the mobile launch platform wasn't wider than the Saturn /Apollo stack on the MLP.

However, there are two Shuttle specific adjustments that spring to mind.

The first was the door in the transfer aisle through which the orbiter ENTERED the VAB. A separate cutout had to be made above the door to account for the vertical stabilizer (tail) which was too tall to enter. 

The second has to do with the transfer window from the aisle into the high bay for stacking.  In the Apollo era, a cylindrical Saturn segment would be lifted off the ground in the transfer aisle and moved through a 16 story opening into the high bay by way of an overhead crane.  For shuttle, those transfer windows couldn't be a larger, and were too narrow for the wings and tail. 

The solution was, after hoisting the shuttle upright in the transfer aisle, the crane operator would rotate the shuttle to an approximately 45 degree offset (determined by aligning the wings of the shuttle with a yellow line painted on the floor) before sliding it through the transfer window, then rotating it back to normal before mating it to the external tank. 

I've got a picture of the lines on the floor that I took from the 16th level of the VAB, if I can find it I'll add it to this reply. 

*edit* http://i.imgur.com/3OehIaj.jpg

835,"&gt; Do you only have a short period of time afterwards?

Well, it depends on who's providing us access -- for a non-NASA launch (like today's, though I wasn't in town), the 45th Space Wing escorts us out to the press viewing area, then ULA escorts us from the press viewing area directly to the launchpad for remote pickup after the launch.  If you aren't at the rally point prior to the launch to be escorted to the press viewing site, you can't get on base at all (so if I was at the beach, there's no way I could get into CCAFS for pickup afterwards, not to mention that it'd be about an hour drive from the beach back to the south gate).

If it's a NASA launch, it's right on the edge of possible, if I were to book it straight off the beach and back to the KSC press site, IF the gate guards happened to let me through, and if I could get back there in time to catch the bus out to the pad for camera pickup.  There's always talk about someone wanting to try it, but nobody seems to want to take the chance of not making it back in time.

In general, we're allowed onto the pad as soon as the LSP gives the all-clear on toxic propellants and any fires that may have sprung up, which means that we're allowed onto the pad at any point from about 45 minutes after the launch.  But it's either on a bus from KSC with a KSC escort, or in our own cars, from a restricted area, with a ULA escort, so there's no ""showing up late.""

846,"It's a New Wonder II (often called Chu Berry, though he played a later model transitional tenor, not a NWII era Alto).  The serial number dates it to 1926.  The M refers to Conn's Artist saxophone line (while later saxes were named/numbered in such a way as 6M/10M/12M, Conn considers saxophones dating all the way back to the teens to be part of their ""Artist"" series and used the M designation accordingly).

*edit* Found a [pic of an early transitional alto](https://picasaweb.google.com/Getasax/ConnNewWonderIIAlto235xxx?authkey=Gv1sRgCJDC7Z7vrvKmlQE#6057133584745092258) (from 1929) that also has the offset 'M' in front of the serial number.  

What you're seeing around the serial number are the rolled tone hole patent number and date, the ""A"" refers to an Alto saxophone in Eb, the serial number, again dating to 1926, and then the ""L"" refers to Low Pitch, meaning it will play in tune with modern instruments (Concert A = 440hz).

Does this wind up ""revealing"" details about Vulcan (e.g., it will be vertically integrated, it requires a water suppression system, and it will ultimately be crew-rated, using the new crew access tower at SLC-41)?  Or were there other considerations that we're not yet aware of?

Plus, there won't be any launch vehicles out on any of the pads visible from the causeway, so the stop there will just be to view the support equipment from a distance.

The LCC tour is something that won't continue to be available once SLS is flying (tours that stop for photos outside the VAB and drive by the exterior of the launchpad should still take place, they did during the Shuttle era).

Any of the tours will drop you off at the Saturn V center, and they'll all wind up driving you past the VAB and other buildings in the LC-39 area.

A few thoughts; if you're hoping to see a rocket launch, no matter who the launch service provider is (SpaceX, ULA, etc), you'll want to factor some extra room into your schedule.  Launching into space is complicated, and launches can be delayed and rescheduled for even what seem to be the tiniest of issues, because every system has to work perfectly, on the first try.

SpaceX has been getting better about launching close to their scheduled times, with one major exception: since the mishap on CRS-7 back in June, all SpaceX flights have been grounded pending the outcome of their investigation.  While there are some rumors starting to surface about when SpaceX will be returning to flight, up to this point, they are just that, rumors.  If SpaceX flies the CRS-8 flight in mid-November, which is what the rumors are indicating, it's very unlikely that they will fly CRS-9 in December -- that's just not enough time between missions, considering things like science experiments being transported, consumables that are perishable, etc.

As for what launches are least likely to change, normally I'd point to ULA's Atlas V launch vehicle.  If you're in the US in December, that's basically your only other choice (there are no Delta IV launches manifested until April 2016).  ULA has a great on-time track record with the Atlas V, and there's currently a launch scheduled for December 3rd, also an ISS resupply mission.  This mission is unique, it it marks the first time the Atlas V is flying an ISS resupply, and the first time the Cygnus capsule is carried aboard an Atlas V, as well as the first Cygnus capsule launched from Florida (normally those are launched from Virginia).  ~~I'm not 100% certain, but this may also be the first time we see an Atlas liftoff without the 4 or 5 meter payload fairing, as ISS resupply capsules usually do not fly encapsulated.~~ I take this back, somewhat.  The Cygnus does have its own 3.9m payload fairing, so I have no idea what the top of the Atlas V will look like for OA-4.  No matter what, it should be cool :)

But no matter what you choose, allow for delays.  Range requirements usually mean that after two consecutive launch attempts, personnel must stand down for 24 hours, so if a launch attempts and scrubs on days 1 &amp; 2, the third day will not contain an attempt, which means you might be waiting around for up to a week to see a launch.  When I traveled to Florida earlier this year for the SpaceX DSCOVR mission, we had launch attempts on February 8, 10 and 11 (with the 11th being successful).  Even Levar Burton wound up missing the launch of EFT-1 last year because he only had time to spend 1 day in Florida, and the launch delayed for 24 hours after 3 aborts on the launchpad.",2015-09-14 13:45:13+00:00,cv14671,1.0,t3_3kuu2s,42854.0,rocketlaunches

906,"I'm not supporting Hulu's use of ""exception shows"" here, but I want to  point something out -- There's a difference between paying for the delivery method, and paying for the show, and it's the same distinction that cable TV has used.  

In both cases (cable TV and Hulu) there's infrastructure involved in getting the show to your device, which is a separate cost from the money required to produce the television program.  The program costs cover things like actor salaries, sets, directors, writers, etc.  The distribution cost would cover things like Hulu's bandwidth bill, or your cable company needing to install coaxial cable and routing equipment.

I do find it a little silly that the ""limited advertising"" Hulu plan, when watching a much older program that doesn't require Hulu to pay as much in licensing will still run with ads, but they're ads for the Hulu service, which I'm already using to watch the show.  That just seems bizarre to me.

925,"While you won't be able to see an STS launch, there's still plenty of launch activity going on out at Cape Canaveral -- between now and the end of the year, even with SpaceX currently grounded, there are four planned launches of Atlas V rockets; August 31, October 2, October 30 and December 3.  The launch on August 31st is going to be an Atlas V in the 551 configuration, meaning a five meter payload fairing and five solid rocket boosters, with a single centaur upper stage engine.  This is the biggest, most powerful variant of the Atlas V rocket.

As far as getting in close to view launches, keep an eye on the [NASA Social](http://www.nasa.gov/social) program.  Not every launch is a NASA launch (3 of those 4 I listed aren't), but for launches in which NASA is involved, such as ISS resupply missions or satellites like the MMS cluster launched earlier this year, they will open applications for people active on social media to apply to cover the launch as members of the press.

This means that for a launch, you get access to the KSC press site, taken on all the same tours the news media is taken to (the last group were invited into the Thermal Protection System Facility, where heat shield tiles are fabricated) and allowed to view the launch from a special, press-only area, either the press site or NASA Causeway, each roughly 3-4 miles from the launchpad and generally the closest any human being is allowed to be.

You don't have to be a hard-core Twitter user to get accepted, NASA is looking for people in all different facets of online communities.  In my case, I was likely picked because I'm active on Reddit and Flickr (even though I'd never used Twitter, FB or Instagram).  There's probably a good chance that the Orbital ATK resupply mission being flown on the Atlas V in December will have a NASA Social attached to it.

934,"There are a couple of reasons -- the Atlas V is certified by the US Air Force to carry National Security payloads, things like NRO satellites, Department of Defense communications satellites, etc.  If ULA were to swap out the engine on the Atlas V, it would (likely) have to undergo the lengthy certification process to continue to provide those services for the USAF, and they've already got a full manifest of launches that can't be put off while they wait to do that.

In contrast, Orbital ATK is not certified for those payloads, so if they make a change like this, they really only have to ensure that NASA is satisfied (or any of their commercial customers) that the new design is as air/space worthy as the old design.

It's the same with SpaceX, there's nothing preventing them from making changes to the Falcon 9 as long as their customers are only commercial operators, but in order to carry DOD payloads, they've got to undergo a certification process, and any major changes in rocket design would require a recertification.

So, while it's feasible to bolt a new engine onto the bottom of the Atlas V first stage tanking structure, ULA would rather spend the time &amp; money they would otherwise spend on recertification building and certifying a new rocket in its place (Vulcan).",2015-08-15 14:31:12+00:00,cu3wdsc,1.0,t3_3h3az3,5937.0,ula

938,"There seem to be a few different answers to this question (as someone who's teetering on the brink of purchasing a 10M myself, I've been doing a bit of study).

If price is an indication of quality, it might suggest that the 1936-1947 horns are the best years, and within that range, the pre World War II horns are in the highest demand.  Since the Conn factory switched over to wartime production in 1941-42, and made altimeters almost exclusively, the 1942-1945 10M saxophones were made of out of stock available up to 1941, almost as a secondary business.  If I remember what I had read correctly, Conn was not fabricating new parts during the war, just assembling saxophones out of parts on hand.

Post-war, normal production resumes, but, just like with any task, the master saxophone builders had a 3-4 year gap in which they were not using their skills to build saxophones, so there's some concern than the 1946-1948 horns, while mechanically identical to the pre war ones, suffered to some degree in build quality.

From 1948 onwards, the rolled tone holes (RTH) were no longer available (although back to that same ""build out of existing stock"" point, it took them a little while to run out of body tubes with rolled tone holes, so there's not a specific cutoff serial number at which the change happened).

There are plenty of talented players who have done side-by-side comparisons and found that the sound of a pre-1948 RTH and a post 1950 straight tone hole (STH) are indistinguishable to the human ear.  The benefit to these post-1948 horns is that since the hardcore collectors are snapping up all the 1937-1941 models, the prices on the post-48s stay a bit lower.

As Matt points out, there does seem to be a point of diminishing returns the later in the lifespan in the 10Ms you go, though again, there are players who swear by the 1959 10M, feeling that it rivals even those pre-war models.  Since the saxophone was a hand-built instrument, there's a certain amount of variance in every one, even between horns built on the same day by the same person, so it's entirely possible that a well-made late 50s horn will outperform a late 30s horn made by someone who was having an off day :)  This is why the advice is to play it to see if you like it!

In general, I've been looking for anything earlier than the mid to late 1950s; my feeling is that post 1960, as production of the intermediate models moved off to Nogales, even though the 10M (and the rest of the Artist range) continued to be built in Elkhart, it was now being made by the 'next generation' of builders (those individuals building saxophones pre-war now being 35+ years older) and in increasingly smaller and smaller numbers.",2015-08-13 13:45:17+00:00,cu1jyfi,1.0,t3_3gqsm6,73957.0,Saxophonics

For this launch, I used ISO 100, f/8 and 1/800 shutter.

What you'll need to do is make sure all the rest of your develop settings are baselined, since anything you change will be applied by default to all new images, so ensure that exposure, shadow, tone curve, saturation, etc are all at 0 or neutral.

Pick an image that has the issue, and go down to Lens Correction -&gt; Profile -&gt; Enable Profile Correction.  Choose the default setup, and indicate the lens make &amp; model.  Then, while holding down the ""ALT"" key (option on a mac), click on the button in the bottom right of the right hand panel.  Normally, it reads Reset, but while Alt is held down, it will read ""Set Default..."" and allow you to set a new default. 

You'll get a warning screen notifying you that you cannot undo this change (you can, but not with CTRL-Z) and you can choose to update the defaults to the current settings.

Once you've done this, the lens profile will be applied to every newly imported image you've shot with that camera &amp; lens combo.

*edit* You don't **have** to ensure all the other settings are zeroed out, but anything which is currently applied to the photo becomes a part of the new default.

1) Sign up to attend a [NASA Social](http://www.nasa.gov/connect/social/index.html) event.  NASA Social participants have the opportunity to view the rocket, and (depending on the launch &amp; security requirements of the Air Force) have the option to place remote cameras at the launch pad.  I had the opportunity to view the SpaceX CRS-3 launch last year a member of the NASA Social program.

2) Become an accredited member of the news media.  This is how I currently have access, I'm a photographer with [SpaceFlight Insider](http://spaceflightinsider.com/), but accreditation is granted to a number of organizations, such as local TV and newspapers, space-related publications, magazines like Aviation Week, etc.

3) Get a job with the AP or Reuters.  Wire services usually get slightly better access to the facilities, including the first pick of setup locations.

4) Get a job working for NASA's public affairs office or NASA TV at Kennedy Space Center -- NASA's photographers get access to the backside of the pad as well as some of the camera mounts around the complex, bringing shots that nobody else can get.

5) Bonus: Get a job as a photographer with SpaceX.  Downside here is that SpaceX will own the images you produce, though now that they're starting to release images under an open license, that doesn't feel as restrictive as it used to.",2015-06-30 16:56:49+00:00,csnpd79,2.0,t1_csno1t1,1930.0,spaceflightporn

One alternate theory is that the secondary explosion was caused by the Falcon 9 first stage flying into/through the fuel spilled by the second stage failure and igniting it.  But that's not confirmed, just a theory I've seen tossed around.

When I posted this (about 30 minutes after the anomaly) I didn't want to specifically call it an explosion until that had been confirmed, and either way, disintegration seems to still be an apt description, though Rapid Unplanned Disassembly might have been more accurate.

1035,"Good questions:

The liquid in the bottle is just water -- if you look at the previous image, you'll see a thermal tile that has not been waterproofed; it soaks up an entire beaker of water without spilling any.  The tile which has been waterproofed, all the water beads up into droplets on the surface and does not absorb any.

The fluid in the green tank is a mix of purified water and silica fibers -- the building blocks of a thermal tile.  The silica fibers look similar to cotton batting or cotton candy when they start the processing, the first step is to mix them with water to form a slurry (mostly done by machine, but there are some stages where the slurry is agitated with the plexiglass paddle) then the slurry is poured into a molding machine where it is formed into blocks.  Essentially, the water mixing helps to align the fibers in the correct direction to lend strength to the final product.",2015-06-28 12:12:39+00:00,cslceuu,2.0,t1_csl6gl6,24677.0,nasa
