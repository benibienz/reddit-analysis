I'm playing single player, and the AI empires just invited me to join a federation.  Since the Unbidden have arrived, I figured it would be a worthwhile exercise.

Unfortunately, right after I joined the Federation, my neighbor Fallen Empire declared war on me, with goals for me to abandon the four planets nearest his sector, and humiliate me. 

But since I wasn't federation president when war was declared, he attacked the empire that was, leading to a near-immediate warscore of -46%.  Even when the presidency rotated to me, I couldn't surrender or end the war.  I tried to bring the fight to the fallen empire, but resulted mostly in a fleet wipe (ours). 

So, what's the likely outcome here?  The former president seems to not care that his entire empire is currently subjugated, but at some point, is he going to decide to give away my planets and humiliate me, or am I going to be locked in a forever war until I can conquer the Fallen Empire?

Also, the AI never bothered to build a federation fleet, not even any designs, so I'm working on that, but at some point soon I'm sure the presidency will rotate again and the AI will mismanage the fed fleet into oblivion.

For context, I've got a sole proprietorship S-corp in the United States through which I provide software development / consultancy services.  I don't currently have disability insurance, which is something I need to change.

What I can't seem to get my head around is what term I should be looking at -- the way I see it, as someone who primarily sits at a desk all day and writes code, it would take something like ""two hands amputated"" or ""traumatic brain injury"" to cause me to become disabled in the context of my own occupation.  

Those of you in a similar situation to me, do you carry disability insurance to Age 65/67, or do you carry a shorter term, like 2, 5 or 10 years?  I feel like if something were to happen to me that prevents me from writing code for a living, it would already have wiped out my ability to take any other job either.

One thing that doesn't seem to exist (or if it does, I can't seem to find it) is having a pop-up 0.5 second preview of the just-taken image in the OVF.  Since the camera is so close to silent, I had become accustomed to seeing that quick review in the OVF on the X100S to confirm that I had actually taken a picture.

Was this removed from the X100T?

Also, has anyone else noticed a slow ""wake from power on""?  Is this related to using too large (32gb) of a card in the camera?  It seems I can shoot right away, but from initial power-on, it takes 2-3 seconds before I can access the Q menu or any other settings.",fujix,Image review on the X100T?,http://www.reddit.com/r/fujix/comments/3c45o1/image_review_on_the_x100t/
