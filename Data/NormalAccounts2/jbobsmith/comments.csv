101,"Hey guys so another question on long exposure situations. I have been doing some night shots and I can't figure how to focus if I'm just shooting the moon and some stars in a shot, I'm using the canon t5i 18-55 EFS kit lens. Is it my lens or would setting my manual focus to infinity solve my problem? And if it is how do I go about doing that? Anything helps, even articles or videos that might help out, thanks! The photo I have posted is one I took this weekend of my friends around the fire, it still seems out of focus. Feedback on the photo is welcome too! Thanks for any help you can give!!

107,So I've been trying to find a good video on how to do a long exposure (over 10-30 seconds) but I just can't seem to find one that shows how to with a Canon t5i. I have the package lens but wad looking into the canon EF-S 10-22. Any help on how to do a long exposure on the t5i would be great!
