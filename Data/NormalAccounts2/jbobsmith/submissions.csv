So I put my t5i up on Craigslist and someone is willing to pay 750$ for it with the two lenses, and my friend would sell me his 6d for $800 with no lens. I wouldn't be able to shoot for a couple weeks but I feel like I'll never find a deal like this and no one will ever offer me 750 for my t5i again? Do you guys think it is worth waiting till I get money for a new lens for the 6d? Thanks for any help!",photography,Upgrade or wait?

Also I shoot in raw and i realized that i have been using up the space on my Lacie pretty quickly and didnt know if thats because when i create a folder and move it into another folder it copies the folder instead of moving it, is that using up more space? and if i delete the folder that was copied are the photos in the copied folder still original?
