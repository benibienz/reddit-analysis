14,I haven't seen any horrible play from Roby. He didn't play great against Oakland but nobody on our team did. He just has such a nack for taking the ball away he's shutdown in my eyes.

15,I'm not sure. He isn't the same kind of shut down as chj or lib. He just is always in the right place at the right time it seems. He's just extra lucky as far as I can tell. His ability to just always be making big plays makes him shut down in my eyes. He gives up more catches but makes more turnovers to make up for it. ,2016-11-17 05:23:55+00:00,da3uqgd,4.0,t1_da3rpnv,5240.0,DenverBroncos

32,Exactly. We can't just give the ball right back every time. The 3 and outs are the problem but the real problem is first down. Why are we always throwing on first down? We always seem to have too many drops and just need to get yards on the outside real quick right away imo. Hillman did it last year and Bibbs can do it this year. We just don't have the line to run up the middle so kubiak passes but the passing game has been very inconsistent when we pass our first 3 plays every game. ,2016-11-10 21:39:59+00:00,d9uxk0l,9.0,t1_d9ux8bm,385.0,DenverBroncos

79,You're right. Our run stopping has gotten worse but the no fly zone is stronger than ever. In my opinion this setup could be better than last year. The whole reason our defense was so good was because of how fast it was. Sure we don't have all the biggest guys up front anymore but we have amazingly quick guys only a few steps away. My point being pass defense is more important because that's where the big plays come from. A tough repetitive run game is only good for a few points a game. Eventually every team will have to pass into our spider web to get enough points to beat us. ,2016-10-31 23:14:07+00:00,d9g3731,3.0,t1_d9fvmdi,9630.0,DenverBroncos

87,Gotta make sure this thread has a FUCK THE RAIDERS. But seriously I see our team having a nice fun game on SNF just like the one we just played. Lots of picks and an offense that either works or it doesn't. But if we can just get one more of those scoring opportunities to be a TD we'll be much better off. I just don't see our offense being so easy to break down next week. The line is finally starting to mesh. We just need a little more consistency and I think the coaches will be making that priority #1 this week. ,2016-10-31 16:12:12+00:00,d9fhrot,1.0,t3_5acktk,5603.0,DenverBroncos

The engines are pretty sweet though. Adjust all the little variables that effect engines. Big power or efficiency. Just no in-between.

439,Exactly. I'm glad you understand. Their secondary has gotten worse. Ours has the same players from the leauge leader last year. The reason we let Danny and Malik get laid elsewhere was because we have people to fill those voids. B. Marsh took all of our snaps from nickel in place of Danny. And  Crick/Gotsis/Billy Winn(who we just picked up) will help fill the void.

445,"Porting is a good idea no matter what. Better efficiency and power when you just let that baby breath right. The power gain from porting an n/a engine is something like 20-30 HP very noticeable difference even without FI. And it makes it so the turbo can gain much more power from the engine. The holes in the new engines are only big enough for n/a. 

TLDR: porting should be done before FI for best results. Porting by itself adds more than a turbo by itself would. ",2016-08-29 20:19:31+00:00,d71o2bq,4.0,t1_d71nscu,351.0,RX8

It has a lower compression ratio which is why the turbo is needed for power. The rx-8 motor will take less boost and make more power.

457,"I feel like we get hate because of all the close games we had last year. But every time some how we found a way. When we absolutely needed to anyway. We made a few mistakes here and there. They see those holes and think we haven't improved. They didn't see the offseason where all three quarterbacks were playing decent with our offense. They didn't see the new line we have. Okung and Stephenson are staples for our outsides. Those two alone are going to make a huge difference on offense. And the defense will be just the same. Lots of veterans with amazing skills. And lots of young guys that want to make a play. Justin Simmons and Will Parks are the names that come to mind. 

I have watched Sieman grow up watching Peyton Manning. Now he seems to carry himself like him. Maybe not exactly the same but he did pick up a few things. Steel sharpens steel. Not to say he's PFM2.0. he's not. He has his own play style. He just has the NFL mindset now to fight for everything. I believe in him 100%. I don't think he will be a top ten passer.

You normally don't want silicon to get above 90°c. Even running a card at 89° all day can make its life span shorter. I recommend setting it at about something that keeps it under 80° at load.

523,Stop what you are doing. You're not going to get any over clocking out of a mobile CPU inside a laptop. You need a larger than stock cooler generally for over clocking at all. All stable overclocking I've heard of is done I bios. Software on the computer itself is bad for your CPU. You don't want to push it farther than it can handle as it can cause damage. If you would like to adventure into CPU overclocking build a PC. Ask the guys over at r/buildapc and they will gladly help. Assembling a PC is not hard. If you can assemble Legos you can build a PC. But please stop trying to ruin your laptop with overclocking software. It disables/overrides bios safety features like voltage and heat causing your processor unneeded stress. Hope I've explained that for you have a nice rest of your day.,2016-08-25 01:21:57+00:00,d6vhtod,1.0,t3_4zfqne,3630.0,overclocking

534,"I'm fine at cod. I stopped playing when I sold my ps3 when I was 19. I'm 21 and Ive had my PC since I was 18. Played bf and loved it. Decided I missed zombies one day so I got my ps3 out and popped in black ops 3. After I got bored of zombies I played online for a good while. I went through a whole prestige but I thought deleting my whole load out I worked months for was dumb so I stopped playing. There's just no reason for me to play cod anymore as I have outgrown it. It was awesome when I was 12-18 to just go over to a friend's house and figure out who could play the best. They are great memories. But that's the only place they are great, memories. It's good the kids have a game to play with their friends but actual adults calling this a competitive sport is just absurd. The thing is anti competitive with aim assist.

535,Yup. You're right. The average cod player doesn't care what the game is. They just want the usual 8v8 30 fps game they've been playing all along. They don't need vehicles just kill streaks that make the game no fun for anyone unable to get 30 kills in a row for a nuke. It's the same game it's always been. Close combat with long knife ranges. There's no thinking about where you want to position yourself on the battlefield. Just run and find the enemy before they find you and then hope you started shooting first. No long range accuracy duels. No in depth warfare just 10 minute arcade games. It's a video game for people who aren't good at video games really. ,2016-08-23 22:42:36+00:00,d6twm5x,4.0,t1_d6ttvur,3813.0,pcmasterrace

794,It is very negligible drop in resistance because the wire is so long. You might be getting your coils a little too hot. But I know what you mean all coils get kinda funky after a while.

795,Just tighten up those leads and wiggle whatever you rapped the coil around a bit to straighten those out. And also Clapton's produce a little bit better flavor I like them on top of twisted builds sometimes. Get some high gauge 30-40 ish.
