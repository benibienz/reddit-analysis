The car only stutters after 3000rpm after the car has been driven hard for about 30-45 minutes. If I get the car going and downshift I'm able to use 4000-7000 no problem. The engine just cuts and shutters at 3-4000 for some reason. I haven't been able to test the check engine light code because of the older plug in for the ecu.
