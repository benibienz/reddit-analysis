Personality

Kain is very outgoing and since he worked around Magnolia for a while, most of the town knows him. He try's his best to make friends and loves helping younger people reach their full potential. He does however have a major inferiority complex because of his traumatic experience. His hobbies include training, fighting and drinking 7up. He 
spends a lot of his time trying to find his parent's murderer. When fighting he never gives in, he either wins or loses. But never from his own words.


Magic &amp; Abilities

Lightning Magic: (obtained via lacrima)

Lighting Scream

Lightning Fist

Lighting Bolt of Rage- a large bolt of lightning descends on foe

Lighting Exploding Nebula- Kains most powerful move (secret)

Also has the ability to fly and do many other basic things with his lightning


Upsides- His magic is immensely powerful and he can move at extreme speeds 


Downsides- With a small body and no defensive spells, Kain is a glass cannon. However he has immense willpower to fight on so you have to hit hard when the opportunity presents itself


Story

When Kain was growing up he was raised by very loving parents who happened to be mages for one of the local guilds in Bosco. Because of this he was always very interested in magic. One day when Kain is 11 his parents guild decides to hit one of the branches of the strongest dark guild in Bosco, Unicorn Blood. They decide to take Kain with them on the mission. While travelling by carts a man blocks the path before moving his hand towards the carts causing a meteor shower to hit and destroy them all, killing everyone in them. Kain is the only survivor and when he sees his parents dead bodies in front of him, he trys to attack the man who is currently laughing exclaming at how weak they were. Kain swings a fist at the man but the dark mage easily blocks it. Kain then lifts his leg and trys to kick the man but is hit from behind by the dark mage. ""You are a tough one, I want to see you break!"" the dark mage shouts before grabbing Kain by the head and bashing him against the ground. Before he can land the finishing blow however the dark mage is interrupted by the fist of a another wizard who punches the dark mage back. At this point the dark mage decides its too much hassle and proceeds to teleport away and Kain see's a mage with a guild mark of a popular guild in Fiore and a fist cackling in lightning before he passes out. Kain wakes up in the middle of Magnolia on a bench. Most 11 year olds would be terrified by this but not Kain. He instead asks around town about how to gain power and most people laugh him off so he instead heads to the towns library to learn of ways to get stronger. It's here he learns of lacrima transmutation and how it can be extremely beneficial for power, however it is 
expensive so he works around town for a year and manages to afford the surgery by his 12th birthday. After this he headed into the wilderness to learn about what his abilities can do. Its been 6 years since then and he has finally returned, his magic ability has certainly increased and he is ready to find a guild to help him avenge his parents murder. Throughout his life, he has lived by one saying by his mother. ""Not everyone is born equal, so if you're lagging behind it is up to you and only you to make yourself better than the rest""",2016-06-01 16:41:56+00:00,d3rwray,1.0,t3_4kojzg,781117.0,Fairy_TailRP
