* Name- Kain Raijin
* DOB- 8 March 1994
* Age- 21
* Rank- Intermediate
* Orientation- Heterosexual Male


**Apperance**

* Hair- Medium size light brown hair in a messy style, usually covered by hood
* Bulid- Lean and with Medium size muscles
* Outfit- White/black vest and blue letterman jacket on over it(hood up as well) and also wears trackbottoms and trainers on the lower half of his body.
* Height- 6'0


**Personality**

Kain is not very talkative and is always drinking (usually by himself). He is also an extreme workaholic and has spent the last 2 1/2 years doing constant training to be able to take on the mage that killed his parents. He is not very confident in himself as he stills see's himself as weak, despite this he is very confident in others and loves helping beginner's with jobs. He also does not give in easy but as he is very anti-social no-one really motices him although he is trying to fix that by talking to a wider range of people.


**Magic &amp; Abilities**

* Lightning God Slaying Magic
- Lighting God's Charged Particle Cannon- Fires a powerful beam of black lightning (must be charged)
- Lightning God's 120mm Black Lightning Cannon- Fires a thin beam of Black lighting which can do a lot of damage
- Lighting God's Black Hole- Instantly makes a orb of black lighting (takes up a lot of magic power)
- Lighting God's Speed Bolt- Kains body is enveloped by black lightning as he uses his power to boost him in the air for a short time allowing Kain to move extremly quick.
-Lighting God's Roaring Punch- Kains fist covers in black lighting allowing to be able to punch opponents with extreme power (can also do this with feet ""Lightning God's Screaming Kick')

Upsides- Extremely powerful and thanks to one of his spells he is using the magic to make himself fast too.

Downsides- Lose a lot of magic power quickly and most importantly, if someone dodges the spell Kain is in major trouble as he has no defensive spells.


**Story**

*When Kain was growing up he was raised by very loving parents who happened to be mages for one of the local guilds in Bosco. Because of this he was always very interested in magic and when he was 18 his parents gave him a book they thought was for basic lightning magic. It turned out the book contained lost magic teachings. He decided to not tell his parents this and trains in all the free time he can get. 6 months later his parents guild decides to hit one of the branches of the strongest dark guild in Bosco, Unicorn Blood. They decide to take Kain with them on the mission. While travelling by carts a man blocks the path and winks at everyone before moving his hand towards the carts causing a meteor shower to hit and destroy all the carts, killing everyone in them and Kain blacks out. When he awakes he sees his parents dead bodies in front of him, causing him to become enraged. He attacks the man who is laughing exclaming at how weak they are. Kain fires a lighting gods particle cannon at him but the dark mage easily blocks it. Kain charges up another attack but is hit from behind by the dark mage. ""You're magic is powerful but you aren't!"" the dark mage shouts before grabbing Kain by the head and starts to bash him like a punching bag. Before he can land the finishing blow however the dark mage is interrupted by the fist of a another wizard who punches the dark mage back. At this point the dark mage decides its too much hassle and proceeds to teleport away and Kain blacks out again. This time Kain wakes up in the Fairy Tail guild all the way in Magnolia. It turns out he is technially an orphan now and has no where to stay but Fairy Tail offers their hand to him which he gladfully takes. He decides not to ask who saved him as he wanted his past forgotten but he couldn't let go of his rage for the dark mage who killed his parents. So for the next 2 1/2 years he trains on his magic and is constantly improving so he can defeat the man who killed his parents.*


**Present Day**
*Kain walks into the guild and sits down by himself and starts to drink while thinking about life*

7,2016-01-20 07:50:45+00:00,self.fairytail,https://www.reddit.com/r/fairytail/comments/41tdmv/ms_augusts_opponent/,False,Considering that August is seen as the king of all magic. If mystogan returns could August beat him? Mystogan uses magic items from edolas and not magic powers from earthland and it is not specified if August controls earthland magic or all magic from all universes.
