But after getting glimpses of the community you guys have build and how in tune the club seems to be with its supporters, I decided to give it a shot and see what you guys were about. So I made my way to the Black And Gold Rally and it definitely proved my previous perceptions wrong. I've never felt such a warm welcome anywhere else and already I was being treated like I was one of your own. Even after I mentioned that I was from Carson (I know, I know..) you guys welcomed me with open arms. And I can say without hesitation I've never felt something like that with the Galaxy. 

So to anyone I crossed paths with at the rally, thank you. Can't wait for the next one and to meet even more of you in the future.

Got my Gio and Mendiola autographs which was cool but couldn't help but feel like this was purposely scheduled on a weekday to get less people to show and it kinda rubbed me the wrong way. Also what the hell was up with that town hall meeting?
