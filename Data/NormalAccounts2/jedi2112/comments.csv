0,"When C-3PO recounts the gang's adventures to the Ewoks. Its such a great, underrated scene that allows us to see the Ewoks culture and lifestyle. Even more importantly it culminates in 3PO's most important moment where he gets them on the rebels side, in contrast to him in ANH, ""I'm not much more than an interpreter and not very good at telling stories."" 

Its just a great spotlight for C-3PO and my favorite moment for him. ",2016-11-16 20:25:20+00:00,da37r9w,1,t3_5db3iw,3975,StarWars

78,"There's so much to describe how special Star Wars is and how much it means to people it seems impossible. 

Personally, I think its how the whole saga and universe works on so many levels.

* The unique visual look and aesthetic of which George Lucas borrowed from so many sources; science fiction and fantasy from pulp, literary and cinematic sources, the elements of Kurosawa's samurai films, the Wild West and World War II mixed in to create a universe that looked real, lived in and possible while being fantastic and imaginative.
* The cinematic quality of how each film (including the prequels) showed how visual effects and technology was evolving 
* the fandom that promoted creativity and a communal bonding between the fans, no matter their ethnic, social, political, religious, and sexual differences. 
* the deep rooted use of Joseph Campbell's works, the functions of the universal themes in all the world myths and religions that permeate the saga. Its easy to follow storyline are built on the building blocks of archetypal storytelling
* the music of John Williams. How rich, iconic and powerful it still is to this day. Lucas and Williams brought back the popularity of grand orchestral scores, which had fallen out of favor in cinema back then. 

Most of all, Star Wars was and is to this day, for everyone. Its a diverse fandom from all walks of life, from people who enjoy the original trilogy only to those love all seven (and counting) films. Its high and low pop culture at its finest. In short, it is the definitive modern mythology of our time.

79,"I personally prefer my mythic fantasy films to be rooted in the mythology and lore they're inspired by. I can understand and am all for artistic license if it makes a story better or more unique than what audiences are expecting. 

Films like King Arthur and First Knight are just bad that squander everything that made the myths they draw from, great in the first place. Though it has its flaws, Excalibur got the world of King Arthur right. John Boorman knew he wasn't making anything historical accurate, and strived to make a fairy tale of swords and sorcery. He however chose to make it graphic with sex and violence to give it weight and a sense of realism without detracting the mythic quality of King Arthur.",2016-07-09 23:17:32+00:00,d561ghj,1,t3_4s0eah,33473,movies

87,"Everything about it. George Lucas really made a one of a kind film that drew from so many genres, stories, styles and ideas into something powerful. He combined the genres of sci-fi, fantasy and adventure from Flash Gordon to The Wizard of Oz. George was drawing from cinema history, Kurosawa's samurai films, westerns, war films, screwball rom-coms and any kind of swashbuckler action piece he loved growing up. Plus revolutionary special effects, a great cast and crew of incredible artists, technicians and craftsmen to help bring his vision to life. 

Most of all was how he combined all the essentials and archetypes from the myths and religions from all around the world, distilling them to their accessible essence in a way that anyone or everyone could get behind. It provided great characters, conflicts and themes that so many films and tv shows emulate to this day.

97,"Overall its alright. I have a lot of nitpicks from resetting the galaxy back to Imperial rule practically, the Starkiller Base, Poe missing for the entire second act and most of all how it repeats the plot points of A New Hope without offering anything new or organic to the Saga.

Other than, its still an enjoyable film. The new characters of Rey, Finn, Poe and BB-8 are great heroes, with Kylo Ren as an interesting villain even though Snoke, Maz, Captain Phasma, and General Hux being underwhelming. The technical aspects, not just the cinematography or effects but the sound mixing/editing are incredible. 
I can't say its on the same level of the Original Trilogy, but its better than The Phantom Menace; Overall I'd say its on the same level of Revenge of the Sith. Great moments with several nitpicks. 

I know I can't be too hard on it because for better or for worse its intentionally the first act of a whole trilogy, unlike the risk taking A New Hope. I think we can all fully appreciate or at least understand The Force Awakens better when Episodes VIII and IX complete the sequel trilogy. ",2016-06-19 23:55:44+00:00,d4fxyy9,1,t3_4ovoqn,3122,movies

I love the pacing, the balance of humor, drama and romance, along with the entire ensemble cast. Most of all is Bruce Willis, who while a lot of people these days see him phoning it in quick cash grab action films, who gives such a nice subtle performance as the Police Captain in how he looks out for Sam and Suzie, better than the Scout masters and even Suzie's parents. 

Overall, I think its just a fantastic film and worth recommending. ",2016-06-06 23:13:18+00:00,d3yq168,1,t3_4mv61a,8940,movies

106,"I rank it as such:

1. X-Men: Days of Future Past (arguably it combines all the best elements of the preceding films. McAvoy steals the shows in acting, and it has real emotional heft with great spectacle)

2. X-Men: First Class (Probably the most fun of the whole franchise. Vaughn really pulled the X-Men from the meat-grinder and proved there's life still in it)

3. X-Men 2 (the best of the 'original series'. Brian Cox's fantastic as Striker. All of Wolverine, Nightcrawler and Storm's scenes are great while Singer balances the themes, plot and characters with action and pacing very well)

4. The Wolverine (its not perfect with the third act being over the top, but it really is a solid action-adventure and gets much of the Wolverine in Japan story right)

5. X-Men Apocalypse (Not a great as First Class or DoFP but still a solid, exciting film, even though its flaws are the growing continuity gaps and struggle to balance the ensemble cast's characters)

6. X-Men (still a decent film and important in proving comics could be adapted to be a great film but hasn't aged as well as the first Spiderman or the last MCU films)

7. X-Men: The Last Stand (a few decent scenes but it really undermines everything Singer planned in the first two X-Men films)

8. X-Men Origins: Wolverine (wasted potential in trying to depict Wolverine's origin story and history. Plus how terribly Deadpool is handled)

I still have yet to see Deadpool, but can imagine it being ranked in the top three. ",2016-06-04 01:03:25+00:00,d3v81ae,1,t3_4mfx1i,2268,movies

132,"I love it as much as Empire. I can understand the Ewok complaints that they defeat the Empire so easily or how heavily merchandised they were, but everything in Star Wars is merchandized, including characters that have 5 seconds of screen time. I personally enjoyed the Ewoks because they're literal underdogs and Lucas meant to show the less advanced race no one can take seriously is actually capable of taking a high advanced military force. 

Its a great epic conclusion to the original trilogy: 

* Luke fulfills his destiny Jedi, he resists the power of The Emperor and faces the Dark Side within himself and proves himself to be his father's son.

* The rebels fight with the Imperial fleet at the Death Star II is incredible and well executed. We get to see Lando in a more heroic role and making up for his actions in Empire 

* C-3PO has a bit of an arc, where in A New Hope he laments he's bad at storytelling and not so helpful but he's the ones who convinces the Ewoks to help the Rebels, using his language skills to tell them of their adventures

* Han might have the least to do but we get to see him as a leader and is the one to weaken the Death Star's shield defenses.

* People criticize Leia's scene when Luke reveals to her their relation but with the exception for knowing Vader's her father, her reaction to Han is kind of appropriate. *What can you say or do when you find out who your real family is and your only brother is sacrificing himself for one of the galaxy's biggest monsters?*

* The Emperor is great from beginning to end

* Yoda's death scene is underrated and serves to show Luke's loneliness and his crisis about Vader

Its not a perfect but neither is The Empire Strikes Back or A New Hope. But its just as great and doesn't look out of place in the Original Trilogy",2016-05-07 14:11:05+00:00,d2wclam,1,t3_4i8bik,41941,StarWars

155,"It's alright at best, but it seems like on hand everything is regurgitated from the first Avengers but lacks the storytelling beats, along with the careful set up and pay off. 

Besides Ultron being a very lackluster villain, the team's chemistry was still good but nothing was improved with the exception of perhaps Hawkeye. The Avengers had all these different personalities in conflict with each other until they learned to put aside their differences and work together, and doing it greatly. Age of Ultron tries setting up the conflict between Cap and Iron Man at the farm but it never grows beyond that. Fighting Ultron and destroying thousands of cgi minions felt so lightweight compared to the gritty action scenes in the first season of Daredevil. 

The Avengers was a very simple plot of heroes teaming up to save the world but Whedon pulled it off beautifully. He understood the joy and power of what Stan Lee and Jack Kirby created and honored it faithfully while making an entertaining action film. It was great seeing Marvel gives him the keys to a great play set and watch him doing wonders with it. But in Age of Ultron, a lot of the enthusiasm seems dried up with all the obligations to the overall universe building and setups for future films. It seemed Kevin Feige and the studio were so protective this time and wanted to have all the wheels in complete motion. 

If I were to rank with the other Phase II films (Still haven't seen Ant-Man yet), it was not nearly as bad or bland as Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World but nowhere as good as Captain American: The Winter Soldier and especially Guardians of the Galaxy.

192,"As a huge fan, I enjoyed it for the most part (obviously it was a serious improvement over The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones), but had a few quips. Most of the new characters were great, the action was fun, the humor was good but a lot of the plot was regurgitated from A New Hope. 

The whole Starkiller Base was the weakest part overall, with General Hux just a cheap clone of Tarkin. While Lucas used different elements of film genres to construct the saga, Abrams just copied the best parts of the Original Trilogy that everyone loved while carefully avoiding any of the mistakes of the Prequels. 

Overall, I still liked it but I can't see it on par with A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and even Return of the Jedi or Revenge of the Sith. When Episodes VIII and IX are complete, I think it'll be easier to see how it stands as part of the entire saga  ",2016-01-05 04:15:37+00:00,cymetn0,1,t3_3zglnb,26647,movies
