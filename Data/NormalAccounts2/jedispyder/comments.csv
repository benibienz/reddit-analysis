591,"[DC Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Challenge):

&gt;The DC Challenge series was conceived during a rooftop party at the 1983 San Diego Comic Convention. The premise of the series was that each chapter would be written by a different author and illustrated by a different artist. No consultation between authors was permitted. As well, each chapter would end in a seemingly impossible cliffhanger from which that chapter's author had to have planned a viable escape, and the name of the next chapter would be provided. Authors were free to use any character or concept from DC's then-50 years of publication, with the exception of those whose appearances they were currently writing. Dick Giordano had been the original editor of the series, but turned the job over to Robert Greenberger before the first issue was published. The last issue of DC Challenge was a collaborative effort by six of the twelve writers.

I was at a Horrorhound Convention and saw Alex Winters in a booth by himself. He looked before and I asked how his day was, not expecting a response. Yet he did. And it completely threw me for a loop. My anxiety kicked in and I quickly left. I felt bad as he was a genuinely nice guy yet I freaked out over him actually responding. 

Another is with an indie movie actress. I had recently been introduce to an indie director that lived not too far from. With each of his movies he has a ""world premier"" at a local theatre. I had watched all of his films plus those of another quasi-local indie director. One actress in particular starred in a lot of them. She is hot as hell so I developed a crush on her pretty quick. Skip ahead to the first time I'm at a premier and I'm sitting in the theatre. My anxiety was already kicking in and I'm trying to calm down. Yet suddenly the actress I have a crush on appears with her boyfriend and asks if the seats next to me were open. I did what I always thought was stereotypical movie behavior by spouting gibberish that somehow included ""yeah"" in them. I was literally at a loss of words around her! Skip ahead 2 years and she's now an acquaintance and pretty awesome person to chat with, but I'll never forget the first time I saw her and turned into a stereotype.",2016-02-22 16:43:02+00:00,d09eyjw,1.0,t3_4706sd,24185.0,AskReddit

1341,"Out of the 7 comics I grabbed on Wednesday I've only read 1, so I need to finish those at some point. 

Non-comics-wise, I'm reading the new Rainbow Rowell novel, Carry On. I'd just confuse people if I go into much detail but it's similar to Harry Potter and it takes place in the final year of school for the main character (Simon Snow). We are only introduced to the previous 7 years of schooling via dialogue and remembrances from the characters. Basically it would be like if JK Rowling only released Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows without the previous 6 books. It's absolutely captivating trying to figure out what magick is like in this world and see how things are similar to Harry Potter universe but completely different (for example, this universe's Hagrid is a woman named Ebb who is a goatherder who uses magick but usually just to control the goats, who graze on the grounds and eat the magickal plants that would instead harm the students). The writing style is a bit unusual but it's a lot of fun and I recommend it to anyone who likes Harry Potter and wished there were a book of Harry Potter telling people to fuck off (literally).

The cinematography had a similar feel of both but the jokes were definitely more Glee and it had a sense of trying too hard. I also think that Emma Robert's acting has degraded over the last year or so, if only she could go back to the quality she was when she first started. As a big fan of her I was disappointed in her performance here, but the amazing performance by Nick Jonas actually made up for it.

Another location I looked at had all kinds of doodles on the walls in crayon, marker, and paint that had never been cleaned. It was everywhere but being kids it was only up half the walls.

The location I went with was relatively fine but had the carpet removed to show the hardwood floors. Which were caked in various types of gunk. I took the place as-is for cheap and cleaned that up myself and it took several days of hard cleaning to get that stuff up. I could scrub and dry and repeat many times and still pull up gunk from the family room floor.

Polarity is about a guy who is bipolar and finds out he has super powers if he doesn't take his medication, but the bipolar kicks in and messes him up mentally.

Deathmatch was pretty amazing where it takes a whole world of new superheroes and pits themselves against each other in a bracket style countdown. You get to learn about the characters and the information given about them leaves you wanting more. This world is so in depth that it feels like it's a complete universe like Marvel or DC.

Supurbia is about the significant others of superheroes and them living in the suburbs together.

The book tells the story of the artist's early childhood and adolescence, focusing on his relationship with his brother and sister. His brother develops severe and intractable epilepsy, causing the family to seek a variety of solutions from alternative medicine, most dramatically by moving to a commune based on macrobiotic principles. As the epileptic brother loses control of his own life, the artist develops solitary obsessions with cartoons, mythology and war. The book's graphic style becomes increasingly elaborate as the children's fantasy life takes over, with their dreams and fears (including epilepsy itself) appearing as living creatures. In brief interludes, the children appear as adults when the artist begins the process of writing the story.",2015-09-05 14:33:56+00:00,curim1m,2.0,t1_curfv43,8161.0,comicbooks

Being president also opens up to many possibilities in other areas of work. Look at all that Jimmy Carter has accomplished after his presidency, and Taft went on to become the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Not many presidents, though, seek further roles in politics.

As for the poorest, I was not able to find an exact answer. Since majority of reports I looked into stated wealth in the form of millions, there were about 10 listed simply as ""less than a million"" without going into more detail. Wikipedia did state that Truman was the poorest President since 1929 with under a million.

She came home drunk one night talking about how proud she was that she had a chance to cheat on her boyfriend but didn't take it.

Due to the mental disorders, I have trust issues and unwillingly push myself away from friends. I've never even kissed a girl and I'm 30. I seclude myself from everyone but my family, and even they don't get how I truly feel about myself. The closest thing I had to a best friend politely asked me to leave the house we were living in and I haven't heard from him in over a month since I moved, guess I shouldn't consider him a real friend anymore? That drains me big time as it just puts more and more on my trust issues.

I failed with a psychiatrist years ago and am trying it again, but so far he just automatically put me on meds that didn't seem to work and he just took me off them, and he plans to throw a new set of meds on me soon.

2367,"I haven't read either series in awhile but taking a look at ComicBookDB for appearances, it seems that in mid-2003 The Owl was in DD for issues 41-42,44-45, then in mid-2004 MK Spider-Man 2,4,6, then mid-2005 in MK Spider-Man 13, 15-18, and then finally late 2005 back in Daredevil for 78,80,81. If The Owl was arrested at the end of Lowlife like I though, he shouldn't be in MK Spider-Man. What confuses matters even more is that Wilson Fisk is supposedly in MK Spider-Man 3 (flashback or not?), and he makes his big return at the end of Lowlife. So I'd venture to say that MK Spider-Man takes place before the Kingpin's fall in DD? Again, I haven't read the issues in awhile so I may be confusing things or overthinking it.

2432,"Ah, ok! Glad you were able to meet him, it's always fun to meet your favorite creator!

I take it your sketchbook is your art in his style? Reason I ask is that while most people refer to a sketchbook as something they themselves sketch in, I've heard for the convention scene some people consider it to be a book they get creators to do a quick sketch in. One local guy had a mission to fill multiple sketchbooks with various artists drawing only specific characters, including reference material if the artist is unfamiliar with the character (I think he has one for Swamp Thing and one for Plastic Man).",2015-06-18 19:14:36+00:00,csb14cd,3.0,t1_csb0pbf,605.0,comicbooks

* **BTVS Season 10 #16** - I'm 8 issues or so behind on this. I got them all together to catch up but for some reason have lost interest.
* **Wonder Woman #41 (variant only)** - It's been ok with the Finches but not great. Once it reaches $4 in the month month or so I may completely drop it. 
* **TMNT Casey &amp; April #1 (variant only)** - I'm also behind on reading the TMNT series so I have no clue what this mini is going to be about. If my retailer gets the RI variant, he always puts it in my file. 

I'm not really excited about any of these. ",2015-06-16 12:39:29+00:00,cs8a91w,1.0,t3_3a01ra,30471.0,comicbooks
