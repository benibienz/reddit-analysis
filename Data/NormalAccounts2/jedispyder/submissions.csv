I thought a unique way to display it would be to have inside a gingerbread house. I've never made the dip before but I would guess that if I left the dip straight on the gingerbread house sides that the sides would soften, which I don't want to happen. I was thinking that if I used royal icing to completely coat the inside of the gingerbread house that it would protect the sides. I've never tried it before so I wanted to check here first to see if my logic is sound.

EDIT: I went with the suggestions of using white chocolate for the protective layer and it worked perfectly!
