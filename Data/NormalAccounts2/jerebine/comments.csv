24,"I'm from Auckland and admittedly haven't been back to Christchurch since. As you mentioned, a lot of construction jobs created - friends from Auckland moved down there for work but also a lot of people left. There was also huge problems with insurance pay outs (typical) with many Cantabrians out of pocket unable to move out of the Christchurch area but not wanting to stay... I believe there are still areas cordoned off? I just think for NZers (immediately impacted and the likes of me who were watching from afar, safe) It was a surreal experience. A case of not expecting it to happen here in NZ (especially as we always thought it'd be Wellington rather than CHCH, Wellington is known for minor quakes as it is on a fault line). I remember the day vividly and the unfolding live footage at which time they were unknowingly showing the deceased. I think in NZ we're incredibly lucky and not used to seeing death on a large scale (as a small country and a small city this was large for us).
