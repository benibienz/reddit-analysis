Was unsure what that 'help' was going to look like but the doctor has suggested I take Escitalopram/Lexapro (alongside speaking to a psychiatrist to better equip myself with strategies etc)... I'm nervous/excited, I want to feel better (duh!) but I am also scared about taking medication - ""I want to do this myself! I don't need medication!"" I'm scared it will be too good and then when I come off it life will be cruddy again?  Will I have any bad experiences? I'm definitely of the opinion that I want to try it, see how I go and if it doesn't work then that's ok, I will try something else... Just wanted to hear others thoughts.
