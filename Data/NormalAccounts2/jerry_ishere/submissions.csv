want to say that i have nothing against most of war snipers leaders and members. I hope WS continues growing as fast as it is and would like to someday see it start its own league as we discussed in its infancy. I wish Baron the best of luck leading WS and the best of luck to the leaders leading their clans.

let me leave off with one thing: 
""War Snipers no longer has the same ambition as when i joined last december, greed has poisoned leaders souls, has barricaded friendships, has goose stepped us into stricter rules, we have developed high level clans but have shut ourselves in, technique that gave us abundance has left us in want, laziness has given power to false faces.

So with this said I'm coming back to it and already bought membership, I have some questions 

•what major improvements/updates have happened since then

•how do I use the new combat system, back when I played things were much simpler and now I'm confused 

•what should I do with the 4mil in my bank, (invest?save?) 

•is there a good guide for thieving, for some reason I have my thieving on a goal for level 85 and want to finish it as a small tribute to my childhood 

•what is magic ""splashing"" I keep hearing about? 

•Are merch clans still a thing
