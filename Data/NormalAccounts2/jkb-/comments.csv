231,"I'm against Miller because:

Houston's line last year managed to get Arian Foster a massive 2.6 yards/carry. Now I do think that current Miller is better than Foster, but even then, 3.6 yards is nothing great.

Houston's line is struggling through some potentially big injuries. As a Pats fan I know how crucial a line is to a teams offense.

Arian benefitted from being a focal point in the passing attack throughout his entire career. His worst year? 39 catches through 13 games in 2014, when he was the number 3 option behind an Aging Andre Johnson and a rookie DeAndre Hopkins. With the injures to Shorts and the other WR2/3 (I forget his name) Jaelen Strong saw the field a bit and looked solid, AND the team drafted Will Fuller. I think Miller may find himself in a similar situation to 2014.

Red Zone Miller is not good Miller. He had 11 attempts for 14 yards within the 10 last year, with all 4 of his TDs being from the 1.  Combine that with Hopkins being a huge part of the RZ attack and I don't think Miller will dominate from within the 10 and scrap together TDs.

Overall, I still think Miller will be a top 8 guy. I just see him as a bottom half of that, rather than the top half where he is being drafted. My RB ranks are:

1. Gurley
2. DJ
3. AP
4. Charles

Auctions are weird. Fun, but weird and it's hard to go in with a plan. I'm in a keeper auction league and will be going in with the following strategy..

$150 salary:

Keeping:

ARob $2
Brady $14
2 of: Vikings, D. Parker, Ajayi, all $2

Gonna try to throw out AB early, then snag whichever of the last big 3 WRs goes cheaper. Then hopefully snag one of Lockett, Brown, Moncrief, Sanders for cheap for a solid WR core

I'd LOVE to snag Leveon for a discounted price and pay a bit for DWill, primarily because Gurley and DJ are being kept, and i can keep Bell at whatever discounted price next year.

After that I would estimate my remaining $ at around 50. I'd use under 10 to snag a worthy QB for 4 weeks (Love Stafford, Rivers, and Eli)

Then I'd go hope to get a consistent RB2 for about 15~. Use the remaining on guys I'll hold until next year and mediocre backups. Don't spend more than min price for a kicker or defense.

That's my thought process, I guess it didn't entirely help you out, but the main thing I love about auctions is you have the ability to get whoever you want. Usually I love to pay big for 2 top dogs, and do what I can with the rest. I would definitely target one of the top WRs early, and possibly Bell/DWill combo since that can be easier to get in auctions.",2016-08-09 18:08:56+00:00,d6aonv7,1.0,t3_4wx2pg,5797.0,fantasyfootball

This also reminds me of Jeremy Hill in that they are both powerful runners and hit the hole hard. The difference I see in Martin is his footwork is a little more shifty (although nothing crazy.. just better than Hill) and he hits that top speed a little faster, even though that top speed isn't anything crazy, as seen by the endless chase down tackles on the goal line 2. I believe he was fed the ball early and often to help ease Jameis in, and as the season went on, continued to get opportunities with ASJ and Vincent Jackson going down.

That being said, I also saw Sims continually get more and more opportunities and do average with them. Nothing special on the ground, but his pass protection and receiving ability was excellent outside of a horrible drop I remember seeing on the Thursday night football game against the Rams.

I still think Martin will have an okay year from a statistical standpoint and be TD reliant as a bruiser. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if he still did great and I was wrong entirely.

Tuesday - Back/Bis/rear delts + traps

Thursday - Chest/Back

Friday - Arms/Shoulders

Saturday - Chest only, volume + low weight day

321,"Man.. I hate these posts. The only time I think you can actually plan in advance to do zero RB is when you KNOW your pick is gonna be a top 3 (or 4 if you like Hops over Lev/Gurley/AP) 

If Lev comes around to you at the 5 pick, are you really gonna pass on him? If you're sitting at the 10 pick and AP falls that low due to DJ/Elliot hype, are you gonna just stick with your strategy and pass on him?

To answer your question though, yes, it is viable, obviously not AS solid, but it's good. I'm my experience, it works best from a top 3 pick where you can grab AB/OBJ/Julio then Alshon/Jordy/DT and then Evans/Allen/Cooper/Watkins. That sets you up with 3 great WRs with high ceilings. The other time you can do it is with a back end pick (9 or 10 ideally in a 10 team draft) where you can grab 2 of Dez/AJ/ARob/Marsh. Then in round 3 you look for any of the bottom end WR1's (Evans/Allen/Cooper/Watkins/Cooks) to fall to you, or look at a decent RB then grab a solid WR2 with upside like Maclin/Decker/Edelman/Tate in the early 4.",2016-06-18 16:44:38+00:00,d4ef72d,1.0,t3_4op6d7,788.0,fantasyfootball

1x cd/lvl quint
2x atk spd Quints

what the other dude said about e uptime

masteries will be fervor every time. The flex spots being:

the life steal or ap/ad per level. Kinda preference, I usually just keep the life steal.

The 1% per enemy killed or 2.5% on cc'd enemies.

I run the 1% one most games unless it's a free lane that I'm going to abuse  and max Q 2nd. (I'll explain later)

The meditation one and biscuit are good if you are in a poke heavy lane and will need to spam w and/or put a few levels into it early.

Gameplay:

I actually max W 2nd most games unless it's a champion that doesn't have a gap closer (Garen, Singed, Nasus, Malphite). Even against malph, sometimes you need to max w 2nd if he's poking with q frequently. I find the ms and heal to be better against any champ that is going to trade with me and not get just kited to death.

I'm not gonna tell you the key bindings because that's preference and as long as you can not fuck up then it doesn't matter.

How to use ult will come with experience. Use it to mitigate the most damage, not to save them from their death. In late game, usually you're gonna ult a carry or yourself, but sometimes you're gonna ult the Fed maokai or the raka. It just comes with time.

Summs:

Tele every time you go top. I guess you could cheese people in silver and gold with ignite but it's best to get used to tele imo

Ignite if a kill lane mid. I don't ever go exhaust against sins because I find it to be overkill tbh. If you want it though to be safe go for it.

Build path:

Nashor first every time.

boots will be zerks next patch after they hit swifties, mercs or tabi if you can't position I guess

After that it's very flexible. Most games you're gonna go Guinsoo's but if you're getting dumpstered it's best to delay that until get going a bit.

Wits End is a very good item atm. If they have 2+ magic dmg I build it 2nd or 3rd.

Runaans 2nd if you're splitting a ton, or when needed. It's an awesome item and I buy it most games that go long enough, usually after Wits or in place of it when they have full ad.

rylais and void are the only ap I ever build. lich isn't really good as q cast is a drop off in DPS after like lvl 13 and should only be used as slow. cap is meh when you don't have ap in the first place.

An item I often build that is overlooked is scimitar. qss is godly on kayle as that's the only way you really die, getting cc locked.

Outside of that I can't think of much. sometimes zzrot if you're just splitting all day. Lemme know if you have any q's or matchup concerns",2016-05-30 18:22:07+00:00,d3pef67,1.0,t3_4lqm7h,2947.0,summonerschool

His Q will be around 10 seconds (less for every level and cdr) so the important thing is to recognize that after he Q's he cannot reposition his soldiers again for another 10 seconds. The E has an even higher cooldown and is often left as a 1 point wonder, so if you can force that out then you are free to bully him whenever.

Key to avoiding Lord's (since that is a big portion of his damage before items) is to recognize his Arise! range. Your E gives you 525 range, and his W has a cast range 450. I'm not sure if soldiers have an attack range on top of that, but if you space properly he should never be able to hit the W-AA-Q-AA combo which is the only pre 6 combo he has for Lord's.

I've had success shoving the lane extremely hard early on.

1. Energy means he can spam while a lot of common counters  (Lissandra, Kayle, Zilean) are mana dependent and can lose trades by spamming skills if inexperienced.

2. You're kind of forced into a defensive position in lane phase. Chances are, Zed will be infinitely stronger than you for a majority of lane phase and, if the player is half decent, won't have much kill potential on Zed while he is free to pressure lane and roam. You are put in a reactionary position.

3. Speaking of roaming, it's never fun when Zed walks bot at level 6 and double kills and snowballs out of control. Zed is very good at turret diving or snowballing off of kills in other lanes.

99% and most likely more of the people that read this sub will never have to alter their training, diet, or drug regimen in order to differentiate between BBing, Classic and Physique. The majority of people here are better off doing a balance between what they enjoy and what works for them.

Someone can idolize Buendia all they want, it doesn't matter if they train perfectly and everything, because some people are fucked with a wide waist.

Westy, WCS, Davis, Augusten in all 3 lineups.

Booker if I want to pay a bit at SG, Felton to save money.

Melo in a lineup, Harkless in one, Gee in another.

LMA or Millsap in my F.

416,"Hey guys. I'm a frequent lurker and occasional poster. Just a quick rundown before I get to my question (s). I play 1 lineup a night, and when I do post it on here, I usually say cash, but in reality it is kind of a cash/GPP hybrid since I only play with a group of 5 friends in a league. well over the course of the season we have kept score and decided to do a tournament, with the winner getting a jersey of the player they play all the time.

That being said, it's a 6 man bracket, double elimination. I finished the season in the top 2 so I have a bye today to ask for you guys' opinions and formulate my own strategy. The first 2 rounds, in order to be time efficient, are going to be 3 head to heads on the same night, best 2 of out 3 moves on. If I win, the semifinals are just a normal bo3 over 3 nights, so if I get that far I can just go back to my normal approach.

what I have questions on is what do you guys think would be the best approach to the single night bo3? Pick 3-5 players that I consider locks to hit value, then spread out my exposure on the other few spots on all lineups? Or just make 3 separate lineups with only 1-2 locks? thanks guys, it's been an awesome season!

Oh, also I have to play WestGOAT every time he plays since he's my player. Everyone else has to do it as well, which could also factor into my strategy.",2016-03-28 15:35:17+00:00,d1gf2ed,2.0,t1_d1fztme,41583.0,dfsports

Rubio - playing incredible as of late, don't see the Kings being able to slow him down.

LaVine - Most consistent player since ASB, still 6k because of below average games against great defenses. Don't see how he doesn't break 30+ 

Gay - usage should shoot way up with Cousins out, FantasyLabs has his average at 32~ when Cousins is out and that is value right there, plus the o/u and spread is, again, great.

Dirk - Chalk for cash, has everything you need. o/u. spread, matchup, recent play

Plumlee - Playing well and price hasn't reflected it.

McCollum - I was back and forth on him and Booker, both be solid but I'd rather just take McCollum since he is the hot hand and I'm already invested in the game a bit.

LeBron - blowout risk, but Mil is horrible vs SFs and the cavs suck without LeBron. He's still cheap  too. Hopefully Giannis and Middleton can keep it competitive for a bit

Koufos - Cousins out, WCS struggling with illness. At min price, I'll take it. He has the potential to hit 10x solely on minutes + price even though KAT is a decent defender.

And yes, I am aware Palmer still put up a great line last week. But keep in mind that the Packers dropped 2 RZ interceptions and that Palmer racked up 80 yards and a TD in the OT that never should have even happened.

595,"I disagree with it being harder to differentiate yourself. Take a look at each position:

QB - Plenty will go Ben, Wilson, Rodgers, but Cousins, Hoyer, and Smith could be sneaky picks.

RB - AP and Lynch is someone many will chase for name value, but AP has an extremely difficult matchup and Lynch may be limited or not 100%. Hill, West/Ware, Blue, and Toussaint (depending on DWill's health) may be better plays.

WR - Lots of higher end guys to spend on here, it's just about picking the right ones. AB, Baldwin, AJ Green, Hopkins.. there are also quite a few low end picks that could have solid days.

DJax, M. Jones, Lockett/Kearse.

People might avoid Martavis considering the past 2 weeks.

TE - Probably best to spend money here on Reed or Eifert.

Def - Maybe take a decent Redskins DST at home, versus a struggling Green Bay team? Many will look to KC or Seattle, but Vikings haven't really turned the ball over a ton, just struggled to score.",2016-01-04 22:07:01+00:00,cym0q2m,3.0,t1_cylzy0k,1092.0,dfsports

Packers - I think they lose against the Skins, and even if they win, usually don't produce a lot of fantasy points. If they win, doubt they beat the 1/2 seed.

Vikings - Don't see them beating a Seattle team that is on fire + getting Lynch back.

Carolina - This is mostly my own call and I could see you making an argument for them, but I am avoiding Carolina. Don't see them beating Seattle in divisional round, and even if they do, I don't think they can compete with the Cards.

KC/Houston - Neither team has impressed me too much, I think they're only in the playoffs because of an easy schedule. Plus I don't see them competing with either 1/2 seed.

Denver - Again, a bit of a judgment call, but I'm avoiding everyone on this team minus the run game MAYBE. The issue with Denver is I really don't see them producing relevant fantasy players even if they win a game or 2. Doubt they beat Pittsburgh also, and even then I see a healthy Patriots team beating them in the afc championship.

I haven't figured out how I rank players, but that's just my 2c on the situation. I do like just about every Seattle player in the top 3 of their respective positions though, and probably the same for the Cardinals.",2016-01-04 18:13:18+00:00,cylqorn,1.0,t3_3zfm47,3756.0,fantasyfootball

668,"Firstly it's important to note how each rank is formulated. Boris Chen is based off a collective average of analysists' rankings, and QOTD does his based off a few things:

Vegas projections, Turnovers/sacks the team forces, and turnovers/sakes the opponent gives up. It's very important that, when picking a defense, we don't JUST look at points allowed, as a majority of defensive points actually come from turnovers and sacks. A team can hold the opponent to 3, but if they don't force anything else, their score will be mediocre at best.

So let's take a look at the QB's. The interesting thing here is that both, as of late, haven't really turned the ball over. Both Gabbert and Bradford have played relatively safe lately. Now obviously Bradford played near horrendous at the start of the season, so I'd give the edge to Gabbert.

Another important thing is we have to take a look at the offenses involved and make an attempt to predict gameflow. Vegas lines provide us with good material to do so. I'm not sure what the spreads are, but I would expect Arizona to be heavily favored, which means Bradford should be throwing the ball a bit more, in comparison to the unknown Bengals offense with AJ McCarron at the helm.  This could mean that the San Francisco - Cincy game is low scoring, allowing SF to not take many risks. Also worth noting that San Francisco has played a bit better at home.

Overall, I'd say they're both solid plays, and you can't really go wrong with either. I would say Arizona is a high ceiling play, with a bit lower floor than Cincinnati, but Cincy doesn't have near the ceiling Arizona has. You can expect Cincy to get a few sacks, and hold SF under 20ish, but I wouldn't expect too many turnovers. Arizona on the other hand has a lot of potential to force turnovers and get sacks, but that Eagles offense is so weird that Bradford could show up and torch Arizona for 30. Also Arizona has shown a weakness to RB's and TE's on short routes, and Ertz and Sproles are threats in that field. That's my opinion, at least.",2015-12-16 17:15:53+00:00,cy16cty,3.0,t1_cy15j87,1196.0,fantasyfootball

-Talented backfield. With a new shot caller on offense, I wouldn't expect Tannehill to be airing it out 50+ times a game. Miller and Ajayi should never combine for less than 20 touches, they're just too good.

-Jarvis Landry is a target monster. While Parker will certainly get his opportunities, Landry should just about always out target him.

-Tannehill isn't exactly a stud QB. The guy just isn't anything special. Other than Landry and Miller being really good, part of the reason they see so many looks is because tannehill is a guy who panics and isn't amazingly talented at throwing the deep ball, so check downs will happen often, whether designed or not.

Now I'm not saying this kid isn't going to be good, because I think he has a ton of talent, I just think the offense around him means that he wont get every single look and that expectations should be tempered.",2015-12-02 21:32:38+00:00,cxkvajc,1.0,t3_3v72p1,374.0,fantasyfootball

929,"Just got back from my leg day. Legs are my strongest body part by far. I can't squat because of bad joints, but here's what I do:

4x15 Leg extension

4x15 lying ham curls

5x5 heavy leg press

4x10 DB lunges

3x25 leg close machine SUPERSET 3x25 leg open machine

Then I do calves every other day, but what I do is 2 exercises for 3x20, super setting both with 10 standing calf raises focusing on squeezing at the top.

The big issue a lot of people have on legs is not focusing on the contraction and stretch. Most just move the weight.

On leg extensions, flex and pause at the top, and make sure you let the weight come all the way down on the bottom.

Treat hammy curls like bicep curls. Squeeze at the top, control it on the way down.

I like to pause at the bottom of my leg presses for a 5 count especially at lower weights when I am working my way up to heavier weights.

Lunges are the only exception, just do these with proper form and you're legs will be dead. If I paused at the bottom or anything I would be dead after 4 sets. Just make sure you take good length steps and go all the way down while keeping a straight back.

That's really it. I've seen the most progress on legs when I focus on the negatives and contraction. Treat it like any other body part. I also am a big believer that squats are not necessary.

Here are the facts.

TRADE: Tom Brady for Matthew Stafford

-The two involved are father and son, with the son being the owner of Stafford.

-Father is a huge Detroit fan. (Owns Calvin, Abdullah, Bell atm.. guess he wants the whole Detroit offense?)

-The two just played this week, with father winning. Son is currently 1-2, dad 3-0.

-Dad has Tannehill on bench plus 8 team league so not in need of a QB for Brady's bye.

-The explanation behind the trade is that immediately after the draft, before Brady's suspension was revoked, a deal was struck to make the trade when Brady returns.

I'm stuck here guys. Miller versus Jax seems automatic, but both Ivory and Morris impressed, Morris especially considered he played vs Miami's stud defense. Should I slot in all 3? Or should I go with 2 RB's and pick a WR? Adams vs Seattle is scary although I'd expect Jones to be matched up on Sherman from what I'm reading.

So, let's say me and another dude both want a player. I elect to drop someone I paid $7 on, he offers someone he had $5 on. I will get the player, and they will retain the value of $7.

Water intake was kept to a minimum the whole day. I had sips with the pancakes, hamburger, and rice cakes but that was about it.

I actually found that I looked more filled out during the night show, most likely due to the larger meal and the extra protein/carbs from rice cakes. This is something I'll keep in mind for the next time I step on stage. After all, it is a learning process.

1283,"      Well guys, tomorrow is the big day. I'll be stepping on stage for the first time and competing in the teen and novice physique category. I could have came in leaner but I hope that my size can make up for that as I am probably larger than most my age. I also have practiced posing like it is my job for the past 2 months so I am extremely confident that I will be the best poser on stage. 
	I'm feeling quite a few emotions now. I'm nervous because I have committed my life to this for the past few months and want it to be worth it. I also have some horrible stage fright.
	I'm excited though because this is finally the opportunity for me to show off my physique I have been building for the past 2 years. When I first started working out with a friend, we both talked of one day stepping on stage, and my opportunity to do so is finally here.
	And, most of all, I am proud of myself. For the first time in my life I made a significant decision and commitment without the influence of others. I could have spent summer partying and celebrating graduation with my friends but that isn't what I wanted to do. I have a dream of one day stepping on the Olympia stage and the thing I enjoy most in life is working out and improving my body, so I decided to sacrifice a little bit of enjoyment for long term success. I am proud of myself for committing MY LIFE to this for the past 4 months.
	I have learned so much about myself during this journey and am almost sad that it comes to an end tomorrow. I have definitely made the decision that competing and bodybuilding as a whole is something I love to do and something I plan on doing for the rest of my life.",2015-07-10 13:40:42+00:00,csyjsut,1.0,t3_3csn9a,1186.0,bodybuilding

Now, as I have played Hearthstone and League, I missed the game and am doing my best to get caught up knowledge-wise. I'll be heading to college soon 5 hours away and luckily got in contact with someone going there and got some good advice on locals in the area.

I'd love to get some help getting back into the game, and this would obviously help me out greatly. Thanks.",2015-07-02 00:33:02+00:00,cspc8mw,1.0,t3_3bsteo,11195.0,yugioh

1296,"A few general things I want you to correct before helping with specific poses.

1. You look off-balance in a many of these. Spread your legs and establish and strong powerful base, then hold still.

2. Try to relax just a little and bring those arms in just slightly. Remember, your goal is to look 'relaxed', and it seems like you are flexing too hard.

3. Don't look at the ground, EVER.

4. This will come with time, but your transitions need to be more fluid. Try to cut down on the amount of steps you're taking, slow down at some points, and later on maybe add in some arm movements and such. It should appear very natural and like you've done it 1000 times, and hopefully you will have by show time.",2015-07-01 13:25:31+00:00,cson7h7,1.0,t3_3bqmzl,9684.0,bodybuilding
