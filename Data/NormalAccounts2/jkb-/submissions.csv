I'm currently leveling a smurf and was wondering what would be the best choices of runes for my 2 pages. I am primarily a solo laner, with a majority of my top play going on Riven. 

I was thinking something like this:

Reds: AD (upgrade to arpen?)

Yellows: Armor

Blues: Flat CD

Quints: AD

This would cover Riven + any assassins and plenty of bruisers.

However, I am not up to date on a standard AP page. Would it be:

MPen, Armor, Mr, AP? or something else? 

thanks guys!",summonerschool,Most optimal rune pages?,https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/4gb3dq/most_optimal_rune_pages/

I know the recruitment thread is Monday but it's the weekend and me and a friend are a little bored. We've been playing this game for a while now and become just bored as it's mostly just the 2 of us or doing solo content. Combine that with the game almost requiring clans or communication now and we are looking for people to play with. Is anyone Junghado, maybe Cerulean? If so, please message me
