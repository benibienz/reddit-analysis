9,"Hi all,

I have a nice bay window that i would like to build a bench across for my new baby to enjoy one day. The space is 8' x 3' x 22"". there are 4 windows so i would like to keep the top of seating needs to be 2"" from the bottom of the window frame. the goal is to have a storage space for toys and blankets that can be opened from the top.

I am handy but i do not really have an idea where to start with this. any thoughts.

I left the baby doctor and when i got there she was upset. she told me the drive was DRINKING IN THE CAR. I ask the driver ""are you drinking"" which he said ""No"". A total lie because i could smell him! I lost and ended up almost choking this guy! The police came and arrested him after they found 6 cans of beer (empty &amp; full). the guy is pretty banged up and my wife needs tons of hugs.

Why I want it is because who doesn't want to broadcast movies &amp; games in 4k? I do not need it because I have a perfectly good HD projector in my media room right now.
 
A random fact about my life is when I was 18 I was in a car with a bunch of people. We had a M1000 firecracker (Read full stick of Dynamite) and we were going to blow up a tree in the woods. On our way to the woods one of the guys decided to blow up a mailbox instead. The mailbox he chose was owned by the towns' florist and was shaped in a wood train. The guy jumped out of the car and lit the fire cracker. The wick was really short and almost blew instantly. The guy who was driving took off with the dude who lit the stick running after the car. The mailbox exploded into 1000 pieces and the fire cracker sounded like a bomb. What we did not observe in all of this was the florist sitting in the garage watching the whole thing. We also did not notice we were in a cul-de-sac and had to go around to make our escape. needless to say we were all caught and had to appear in court. $2500 later we learned not to be so stupid again. Today 3 of those people are Doctors, 1 is an Army Ranger and I am an engineer. ",2016-01-14 01:45:15+00:00,cyxeon2,1.0,t3_40tr2x,21554.0,Random_Acts_Of_Amazon
