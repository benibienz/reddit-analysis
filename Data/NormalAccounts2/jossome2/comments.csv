5,"""Is this the hearing for Topher Limings?"" A balding man with a cleanly shaven beard, who I am assuming is some sort of guard, nods in response and opens one of the double doors for me. The room inside is cold and poorly lit. Not many people sit in the 20-30 benches that lead up to the stage/podium. I can see a redheaded woman, around 50 years old, weeping in the front row. It appears to be Topher's mother. The man with his arm around her mother is, presumably, her step-dad. 3 or 4 other people are scattered in the second and third rows but from what I knew, that's to be expected for Topher. 
I grab the first seat I can find, close to the front, and tap my feet impatiently. It's only a matter of minutes before the judge walks in from a small door on the right and walks up to the podium. He clears his throat and begins to read from a piece of paper in his hand. 
""We are gathered here today to discuss the final destination of Miss. Topher Jean Limings. First, we will hear from her mother. Next, her sister. And finally, a Miss..."" He pauses, squirts, and then reads ""Lor-Lorvent?""
""It's Laorvient (Lar-v-ent)."" I can tell he doesn't care by the way he doesn't look up from his paper. 
""Yes, well,...Let's start with her mother. Mrs.Keat?""
Topher's mother gave a lovely statement about watching her daughter grow up and how, despite her bad choices later in life, she still knew that her little girl deserved better than what others may think. Next, was her sister, Denise. She opposed her mother's opinions and believed that Topher deserved the worst punishment they could offer. 
I, now, take the stand and pull out the stack of note cards I've prepared. 
""I...was Topher's therapist. She came to me, in the beginning, once or twice a week. After a month, however, she began coming by 3 or 4 times a week. Eventually, our sessions became a daily thing. What I could gather from our time spent together was this. She felt very strongly about everything she did. There was never a move she made without thinking it over for weeks at a time. The only issue was that she didn't always know what the right choice was. She was hostile, yes. She was violent at times, yes. She even admitted to me, once, that she contemplated death almost every night. The world she lived in was very different from mine and yours. There's a quote I like to think of in times like-"" I can see their eyes glazing over. The room, including the judge, has already made up their minds. Nothing in these note cards can save her. ""Um...the truth is... Mrs.Keat, I was in love with your daughter."" The woman's head pops up and her expression reads nothing but confusion. ""We had grown close during our sessions and at one point, developed a relationship. I understood her. I was the only person that could calm one of her panic attacks. At the same time...she saw me as a person. Other clients saw me as nothing more than a wall to release their emotions on. Topher actually valued my opinions, she SAW me. Working in a job where you're never seen can be quite a tedious one. I guess what I'm saying is that...this woman does not deserve what I know she is being given. She is worthy of so much more...Thank you..."" It's not until I reach my seat that i notice my face is wet. At some point I must have been crying. The judge takes his place at the podium and, yet again, clears his throat. 
""Thank you to everyone that has spoken today but I have made my decision. In the case of Topher Jean Limings vs. death, I hereby sentence Miss. Limings to serve her afterlife...below ground."" 
And with that final remark, I can literally hear my heart breaking in two.  ",2016-06-14 21:45:22+00:00,d49d5j2,1,t3_4o3g4r,5088,WritingPrompts
6,"""NEXT!...Name, please.""
""Ph-Phil.
""Phil Clucker?""
""Y-yes, that's me.""
""Why so shakey, Phil?""
""Well, it's j-just that...i don't know what to expect. I mean, it all happened so f-fast!""
""Well, I can assure you that things will be blue skies and fresh feed for you from now on.""
""R-really?""
""Of course! You didn't wait in line all day just to get hit by another car!""
""Well, I guess that's t-true. So, do I go in now?""
""*Lifting the velvet rope and motioning with his arm* Welcome to the other side, Mr.Clucker.""

27,"Is nothing here worth saving?
Not a breath or memory
Is there nothing that can explain
What tormented you and me?

The picture shattered in it's frame
The broken flower stems
The wine glass on its side
The lipstick on its brim

Is nothing here worth saving?
I'd rather rid me of this now
It's not a matter of what happened
But a matter of just how

A comment, rebuttle, a spat
Offense taken none the less
A escalation in mere minutes
No notice of the mess

Is nothing here worth saving?
If not, then now's the time
To paint over the door
That slammed shut on a dime

Drenched in tears and ignition
It'll all go up in flames
Nothing here's worth saving
Because nothing is the same...",2016-04-05 22:59:35+00:00,d1rdap7,1,t3_4divpp,1781,WritingPrompts

If I wasn't the only one in this office, I'd be racking my mind for some way out of working late, tonight. Sharlett went home a half hour ago and the janitors have already made their rounds for the night. All I'm doing is paper work for next week's board meeting but I need the hours. That's what I get for drinking Vuhla's soup 3 weeks after the full moon; 2 sick days and a lot of time that needs to be made up. 
Tick...tick...tick...tick
My back starts itching and it's enough to drive any normal person crazy, but I'm not normal. I'm faaaaar from normal. Now, my tongue is itching and I know exactly how long before that clock strikes twelve. If I can just finish this last report quickly, then I can probably start my stumble to the car before things begin to go blurry...literally. 
Tick...tick...tick...tick
I hit save on my document and can feel my eyes swelling with blackness as I reach for my scarf and purse on my desk. Great, just great! 
DONG! DONG! DONG!
My vision goes completely black and I can feel my body tingling. An orgasmic surge of energy washes over me as I feel for my belongings and place my hand against the wall to find the exit. I breathe heavily as my fingers wrap around the door's handle and swing it open. Now to walk down 6 flights of stairs without dying. Greaaaat. I start to place a foot on the first step but feel my heel wobble beneath me. Instead of descending the stairs of death, I sit on the ground and wait out the five minutes of shaking and nausea. 
Finally, I sense what feels like a bubble making its way up my stomach, through my throat, and up to my mouth. Long story short, I leave a nice little puddle of puke in the staircase for the janitors to clean up tomorrow. It may seem shitty of me but I have no other option. Opening my wet eyes, I can finally see, but more than see. Everything is heightened. God, no human could ever understand this feeling of warmth. It's like I can see every microscopic organism, smell every tiny scent, and feel every object 10 times greater than before. 
I steady myself upon my pumps and hoist my purse onto my shoulder. The stairs will be no problem, now. My body rises, leaving about an inch between me and the ground as I glide over each step and make it down to the parking deck in mere seconds. My car door is opened without the need to press a button and I start it without ever pulling out my key. As I start to back out of the space, I chuckle to myself thinking how funny it is that I could simply fly home, right now, if I wanted to. Then again, I wouldn't want the humans to wonder why my car was still here over night.",2016-04-05 16:56:22+00:00,d1qw2hj,1,t3_4dh1yx,3488,WritingPrompts
