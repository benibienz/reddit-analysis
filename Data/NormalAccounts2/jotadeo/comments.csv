One of the most frustrating things to see in my own sports fandom is an inconsistent strike zone. I hate seeing that whether it affects my team or the rival team.

Besides a couple of egregious examples, notably the one in OP's pic, I don't have a problem with the strike zone Kershaw and Jansen got; it's just that it seemed to me that Cubs pitchers didn't consistently get the same strike zone. That said, I think there were one or two pitches that were favorable to the Cubs pitchers or hitters about which I recall saying, ""that was a [strike | ball],"" depending on which team was batting.

570,"Very true. That could very well be an overly sensitive response on the part of the recipient. 

On the flip side, it could also be a reasonable response based on how the info was presented. For example, I did a poor job of presenting the info in my initial comment as a ""hey, just so you know..."" response. I should have included some of what I explained in my last comment to avoid activating the recipient's affective filter (i.e., keep from putting the recipient on the defensive).

571,"I figured...*but* I was more worried that you might be influencing young minds and empowering burgeoning grammar Nazis with bad information. 

Also, I wasn't entirely sure you were joking and I wanted to provide an informative response before the self-proclaimed grammar snob jumped down your throat (the potential was there anyway).

Plus, I think ellipsis is a good concept for people to know about at the conscious level. I mean, it made me think about how I might include ""you're welcome"" in my silly example. I couldn't come up with appropriate wording with that in there, so I avoided it altogether. Because of this, I got to wondering about the origins of that phrase.",2016-10-14 06:06:18+00:00,d8rfblw,5.0,t1_d8rezwq,785.0,AskReddit

573,"Nah, that's a good example of ellipsis, which can roughly be defined as omitting one or more words that are not needed for context.

In this case, what's being expressed is something like this: ""Grammar [is the thing that I am a snob about]"".

Another good example that doesn't have any preceding context is when somebody asks, ""coffee?"" What they're really saying is something like, ""would you like some coffee?"" We understand the shortened version just fine and quite likely appreciate (subconsciously, at least) the brevity.

Can you imagine life without ellipsis?

- Would you like me to serve you some coffee?

- Yes, I would like you to serve me some coffee, please.

- I want to thank you for serving me the coffee.

- It is no trouble for me to serve you the coffee.

...instead of...

- Coffee?

- Yes, please.

657,"There's no way I can have any idea what you're going through...except the hating not being able to do something that is beneficial for me, which I can completely sympathize with. 

Here's a little insight on that if you're interested: when you don't take action on something you have control over (like how much or how little to say to people, opening up emotionally or not to loved ones and caregivers, sitting on a decision you should or have to make, etc.), life happens for you and it happens *to you*. I've felt that myself and it sucks.

Once I identified this as one of the issues in my life, well, it still sucked because I was overwhelmed by it. But, little by little, I found ways to start making decisions to actually do something rather than let life wash over me and push me this way and that. I made sure to celebrate any of those ""I've taken control"" moments, large or small, and tried learning from the times I didn't do so well.

I did learn that I had to find people I could trust while trying things I hadn't before because, without that trust, I was more likely to get a response/understanding that didn't work well for me. Many times that made me want to go run and hide in the ""safety"" of my shell of indecision and inactivity. So, that trust is important--just know it doesn't guarantee a positive or encouraging response.

Anyway, those are my $0.02. I've got other thoughts if you want to hear them. Feel free to PM me. Thanks for sharing and thanks for feeling like you could share with us. I hope it feels good and encourages you to do more of it.

.300 = ""three hundred""
.290 = ""two ninety""
.309 = ""three oh nine""
1.000 = ""one thousand""

For example, check out [this video about Varidesk](https://youtu.be/pAnxhX3XT6w), one of the popular (and more affordable) options out there. I've got one at work and the only thing I need to do when I raise the desk is adjust the height of my monitors (perhaps this is what you meant by changing the orientation) so that they're at the proper eye level.

One strong recommendation, also get an anti-fatigue mat. It's a little bit of a (figurative) pain to figure out how to store that when not in use, but it's a lot better than the (literal) pain you might feel without it (primarily in your feet but maybe elsewhere, too).",2016-09-18 10:29:45+00:00,d7rmdoo,7.0,t1_d7rdtc0,24039.0,AskReddit

A ""tag"" is a keyword (or keyword phrase) used to help categorize items so that they can be found later by browsing or searching for that keyword, such as the tags on Twitter (or tags in photo management programs like Flickr, social bookmarking sites like Diigo, etc).

I'm from Milford originally. I was in a band called Electric Sex on Ice. One of my friends/band mates was in Warbucks. We occasionally hung around with people from different bands from New Haven. We hung out in New Haven from time to time. We bought beer at Yale Bowl Wine and Spirits because they sold to minors. My friends stole records from the music store on the second floor in the same little strip as the Yale store on Broadway (I think that's the name of that street--the one with the parking lot in the middle of the square). We'd sometimes go to the bar right off that square where local bands would play (I seem to recall seeing jazz bands there) and where the actress from Rosanne would hang out even though she was underage.

I somewhat agree with your statement. I think it's true to a certain point, but it's also a job and every job had parts about it that suck. I'm sure that interacting with fans can be both enjoyable and sucky, depending on the individual fans and even on how you're feeling in a particular day.

I'm fairly certain we caught them at the right time. They were a band with a decent following (probably much less so on the East Coast, though) and they had an album that had just come out on a major label...but they were still playing small clubs.

1021,"The Moon in New Haven, CT. I was there! I wasn't supposed to be at the show and I met Kurt Cobain because of it.

Here's the story:

* Two of my friends were HUGE fans of Nirvana and other Sub Pop bands (other friends a little less so)
* They went to venue really early and met the band around sound-check time
* They drank (and smoked???) in the band's van for a good part of the afternoon
* They got put on the guest list
* A good number of my other friends went to the show
* Two friends and I didn't go to the show because we didn't have enough cashola to get in and we didn't know Nirvana that well. Our plan was to drive around New Haven while we waited for our friends to get out of the show
* The guy driving us around decided to go home, so we had him drop us off outside the venue
* Super fans saw us hanging outside and motioned through the window for us to come in. We rubbed our thumbs and index fingers together to indicate it was a money issue and they pointed us towards the door
* After reiterating we didn't have enough money to get in, one of our friends leaves for a moment and comes back with Kurt
* Kurt says to Fernando, the guy at the door (and may have been the owner or promoter or something...we knew him from other venues in the area), ""put these two on the guest list""
* Fernando says he can't since they were supposed to have 25 on the guest list and they already had 43 and we would have to pay
* We told him we didn't have enough money, so he said he'd put one of us on the list and the other would have to pay
* We said we still couldn't make the $8 cover (I think it was 8...starting to get fuzzy now) since we only had 3 bucks between us
* *Kurt reaches in his pocket and pulls out a five*
* We're like, ""you sure, man?"" He says, ""the more, the merrier"" 
* So, we go have a blast at the concert after Kurt fucking Cobain pays for us to get in to his own damn show
* After the show, I go with either one of the super fans or my drive-around-New-Haven buddy (again, memory is starting to get hazy) to thank Kurt again and he asks us if we want to be on the guest list for the next show (the following night, I believe) in NYC with the Melvins (I think)
* We tell him we didn't have money to get into this show and more than likely wouldn't be able to make it to the city. He said that was ok and he'd still put us on the list and asked for our names

EDIT: I did not see the show in NYC. :-(

~~In~~ On some level it seems crazy, though it was before they got huge and it's just a reminder that the people on stage are, well, just people, too.

One thing I don't think shows up in the video of the show at The Moon is that Dave Grohl hops off his drum kit, in the middle of a song as I recall, to greet some friends he was surprised to see there. I happened to be right next to them over towards the left of the stage (audience left; stage right). EDIT: I just rewatched the full video (check out [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/4zyk49/nirvana_plays_smells_like_teen_spirit_in_a_small/d6zu7h5) from /u/ciniseris for the link) and it could be that he gets up and greets his friends at ~9:29 of the video, which *is clearly not* in the middle of a song.

1044,"&gt; My point is that the picture painted here very likely incomplete

I understand that. However, my point here is that it quite likely doesn't matter if there is anything omitted that might help give a fuller picture. What we have access to indicates the DNC was making attempts to paint a negative picture of one of their candidates, which clearly goes against what their Charter and Bylaws state.

One might reply ""well, you're speculating about how the full picture might or might not inform the situation."" That's true, but I'm speculating about a speculation, i.e., ""the picture painted here very likely incomplete.""

&gt; We'll have to disagree about whether or not the process had concluded.

According to the DNC Charter and Bylaws, it's clear it has not yet concluded. And that's what we're talking about here. It's not up to me or you to decide when the process has concluded. There are rules, ones that they made up for themselves.

Take an example from Major League Baseball. When the Red Sox won against the Yankees the year they won the World Series the first time in 86 years, they were down three games to none in a best of seven series. Most figured it was over since no team in MLB history had ever come back to win a series down 3-0. 

If it were up to most people, even people within MLB, the Yankees could just go straight to the WS. But the rules called for the winner to meet the requirement of winning seven games. And, against all odds, the team that was hanging on by a thread came back to win.

It's not a perfect analogy, but the major points stand. There are rules that the organization made for themselves that they needed to abide by. And despite past history, there was still a chance that the underdog could make a new history.",2016-07-23 22:31:00+00:00,d5o3dsf,7.0,t1_d5nwgpm,11850.0,PoliticalDiscussion

1048,"Well, if you're going to try to pin me down to prove that this specific discussion led to an actual instance of partiality and un-evenhandedness, then, darn, you got me.

On the other hand, whether you agree or disagree, the larger point for me is that this is representative behavior of folks at the DNC **actively** seeking ways to diminish one candidate so that the other one seems more favorable. It's not some side conversation amongst friends by the water cooler that is just some idle talk that means nothing in the end. They are purposefully engaging in brainstorming to ultimately create some negative public narrative about one of the Democratic candidates, which does indeed go against their bylaws.

If this example that we're talking about were the only potentially egregious thing in the document dump, then I would be more willing to entertain the idea that these could be just a couple of guys doing ""omg, what if"" scenarios in their spare time or even going rogue. But, it's not the only example and it is quite obvious that it's a culture at the DNC that goes all the way to the top.

With the documentation that's out there, I have a really hard time seeing how anyone wouldn't be at least considering that there were shenanigans going on there. Everyone is certainly entitled to their opinion, but based on what I've been reading, anyone that isn't starting to consider that something might truly be rotten in Denmark is someone that is completely partisan and will likely never be open to looking to see if there might be anything amiss, at least when there's ""my"" candidate versus that one or ""my"" party versus the other one.

You start off with an easy, low-risk level in which it's hard to die and you learn the environment relatively comfortably and without anxiety. Then new elements and complexity are added as you progress through the next levels, but nothing that makes you want to throw down the controller and walk away (ideally, anyway). Another way to think about it is ""previous complexity/difficulty + 1"".

I'm not sure how much this applies to your situation, but I'm guessing the more you get people engaged with the game, especially at the beginning, the less attrition you'll have.",2016-07-06 04:13:37+00:00,d50zcnc,8.0,t1_d50w5u9,5484.0,AskReddit

And they all came back, shook my hand, and we had a great time on the bench, talkin' about crime, mother stabbing, father raping, all kinds of groovy things that we was talking about on the bench. And everything was fine, we was smoking cigarettes and all kinds of things, until the Sargent came over, had some paper in his hand, held it up and said.

""Kids, this-piece-of-paper's-got-47-words-37-sentences-58-words-we-wanna-know-details-of-the-crime-time-of-the-crime-and-any-other-kind-of-thing-you-gotta-say-pertaining-to-and-about-the-crime-I-want-to-know-arresting-officer's-name-and-any-other-kind-of-thing-you-gotta-say"", and talked for forty-five minutes and nobody understood a word that he said, but we had fun filling out the forms and playing with the pencils on the bench there, and I filled out the massacre with the four part harmony, and wrote it down there, just like it was, and everything was fine and I put down the pencil, and I turned over the piece of paper, and there, there on the other side, in the middle of the other side, away from everything else on the other side, in parentheses, capital letters, quotated, read the following words:

(""Kid, have you rehabilitated yourself?"")

I went over to the Sargent, said, ""Sargent, you got a lot a damn gall to ask me if I've rehabilitated myself, I mean, I mean, I mean that just, I'm sittin' here on the bench, I mean I'm sittin' here on the Group W bench, 'cause you want to know if I'm moral enough join the army, burn women, kids, houses and villages after bein' a litterbug."" He looked at me and said, ""Kid, we don't like your kind, and we're gonna send you fingerprints off to Washington.""

And friends, somewhere in Washington enshrined in some little folder, is a study in black and white of my fingerprints. And the only reason I'm singing you this song now is cause you may know somebody in a similar situation, or you may be in a similar situation, and if your in a situation like that there's only one thing you can do and that's walk into the shrink wherever you are, just walk in say ""Shrink, You can get anything you want, at Alice's restaurant."" And walk out. You know, if one person, just one person does it they may think he's really sick and they won't take him. And if two people, two people do it, in harmony, they may think they're both faggots and they won't take either of them. And three people do it, three, can you imagine, three people walking in singin' a bar of Alice's Restaurant and walking out. They may think it's an organization. And can you, can you imagine fifty people a day, I said fifty people a day walking in singin' a bar of Alice's Restaurant and walking out.

1204,"&gt; My problem with these guides is their only good for what you're currently drawing.

If I may, I'd like to be a bit critical of this line of thinking. With this approach, what would be the point of a new musician practicing scales or someone new to football running simple drills? After all, those are good for doing only those things, right? 

Wrong. They help build endurance, dexterity, and confidence. To that last point, arguably the most important one, they are accessible to the beginner and achievable (but not necessarily easy).

So, you start with things appropriate to your level. You build up some skills and some confidence. Then you move on to some harder things or just different things that aren't necessarily harder and you get some more skills and confidence. At some point along the way, you'll start to be able to pull some ideas out of your head and get them on paper, even if they don't look too much like you imagined.

Short story: it's a process. I highly recommend you focus on that idea, that it is a process and eventually the product will come from the work you put into the process.

With regard to the process, I really urge you to let go of any notion that anything you try to draw has to be good. Anytime you draw (or do many things in life), be proud of the fact you are taking part in the process and while you're working at it and/or when you're finished, look for takeaways, i.e., try to see what you can improve on and what you liked about what you did...the last part being a hugely important piece that most people forget to do when looking at themselves and others.

RE: Trump: Nate (possibly someone else at 538) indicated the night of the caucus that indeed the polling was off and that they'd have to look into what could have accounted for it (you know, to learn from the mistakes).

The 538 folks have said it's harder to get accurate polls during the primary/caucus season than it is during general elections. Also, keep in mind 538 uses an algorithm on a number of polls to come up with a forecast (and like a forecast, it's a range of possibilities, not a binary win/loss prediction). So, if the polls are off for whatever reason (e.g., unaccounted for social media activism, last-minute enthusiasm, etc), then the forecast will be, too. Of course, the algorithm could be off as well.

538 is really good overall and it would behoove us to keep an eye on what they're saying and how their forecasts shape up over time. 

All that said, you're right; every little bit helps, and people need to do more than follow things on 538 and SFP because we **are** more than 5 points down in most states. ",2016-02-05 19:48:56+00:00,czp6hfn,1.0,t3_44c90l,3253.0,SandersForPresident

Disclaimer: I'm a Bernie supporter 100%. That said, I want HRC to be a strong, reliable candidate in case she becomes the nominee.

That seems to me what the mods were going for: give the folks interested in organizing and taking action a reduced-noise space a couple of days a week and open things up for a wider audience the rest of the week.

Hopefully, people will still lurk on Tuesdays and Thursdays to follow some of the organizing efforts and maybe one day decide to jump in on something that resonates with them.

1583,"I disagree. There is value in having open discussions. And those discussions may help generate enthusiasm. However, this is not the place for them. 

This sub/community is intended as a space to organize and plan for taking action. Discussions that are not focused on these things, however related to Bernie's campaign those discussions might be, are distracting from the intended goals. 

And however much you might not like to hear it, this sub and subs all across Reddit are not open spaces where you can do/say whatever you want, just like any organization you might belong to (they are called organizations for a reason). Keep in mind that you and others do have the opportunity here on Reddit or elsewhere to create the space(s) that you'd like to see. There might be a need for what you envision to keep some members of this sub enthusiastic and engaged. So, you/others might consider creating a space like that. If you do, I'd encourage you to let folks there know there is also a space here dedicated to organizing and taking action.

You're right that there might be some attrition because some like you don't like the direction this sub is taking. That's ok. That will open up space and reduce the noise for those who are interested in talking about how to get out there and take action. Hopefully, some lurkers will remain and eventually decided to step up and take action.

I'll end by saying that I don't believe the rules as stated are too ""micromanagey."" Hopefully the mods won't micromanage beyond the rules, but the rules as written allow for a good amount of flexibility...within the focus of taking action to help Bernie get the nomination. 

Oh, one more thing, I hope you do decide to stick around and not just #FeelTheBern but get out there and #BeTheBern (canvas, distribute flyers, join a local/campus Bernie group, attend debate watch parties, write letters to the editor, create an open forum Bernie sub, etc).

1587,"Thanks for the thoughtful reply!

I think the spirit of your message is a very good one. I just think we have to be a bit discerning about what we're being told and what the reality is, *especially* when we're sharing those ""facts"" with others. 

We, supporters of Bernie, are gaining a reputation of overreacting to things and I think we can really damage our efforts to have others listen to Bernie's messages if we reach a point where a critical mass of the general public thinks that we/Bernie are just fanatics who will say anything to get him in office. He's fighting from behind and anything negative about him/his supporters will only make it that much more difficult.

Perhaps you could have titled the post like this and still stayed with your main goal of encouraging people to take action by donating: ""New York Times Writer Says Emily's List Official Accused Bernie Sanders' Team of Sexism - time to donate?""

1588,"I'd like to hear more about your thoughts on why you think that way.

Personally, my current take is that the new rules are geared towards keeping posts focused on topics/ideas/etc within the intended scope of the sub and avoiding posts that fall outside of the scope. At the top of the [Community Guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/sandersforpresident/wiki/rules), there is what is essentially the mission statement for this sub:
&gt; /r/SandersForPresident aims to provide an informative, robust, and activism-centric community to support Bernie Sanders and his presidential campaign.

With that, here's my stab at stating (some of) what's in-scope and out-of-scope (feel free to give feedback):

**In-Scope**

* Activism (in its many, many forms)
* Discussion around creating tools, materials, outreach campaigns, etc. to help #SpreadTheBern or improving existing ones

**Out-of-Scope**

* Criticizing/Attacking other candidates or groups
* Campaigning for other candidates
* Complaining about mainstream-media coverage (w/o action-focused discussion)
* Complaining or fretting about polls (w/o action-focused discussion)
* News dumps (w/o action-focused discussion) 
* Topics not directly related to helping Bernie get elected

In short, it's an action-focused community and, as such, there need to be guidelines to keep things focused and limit the extraneous noise. Without that, it would be hard to get things done.

Also note that the restrictions discussed in this post are only in effect on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Things are a bit more flexible on other days. The [Weekly Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/wiki/weekly_rules) list has a brief description of the daily restrictions.

Lastly, I want to say I know these rules are in contrast to what has been allowed up to now. I believe it was ok to be a little loosey-goosey when it was a smaller sub, but now that it's a huge and very publicly visible community, they are rightly (in my opinion) trying to reign things in a bit. So, that's maybe where the pain point is for you and likely others as well.

1589,"I'm not quite sure where the folks from Emily's List said anything about sexism. They were quoted as saying the comments were ""condescending,"" which in my opinion they were.

My disclaimer here is that I'm not saying OP misrepresented the NY Times piece because that is how it's titled. That said, I'd caution OP and others to refrain from getting worked up over this and making the same (un)intentional error of putting words in people's mouths. Again, unless I'm missing something, it was the author of the piece who said it was an accusation of sexism--not Emily's List.

In any case, there are issues with Emily's List being a top donor to the HRC campaign. Take what they do actually say with a grain of salt.

Lastly, I believe the spirit of this post is to take this unfounded accusation (by whomever) and use it to encourage people to donate to Bernie's campaign. So, yes, by all means take this as motivation to donate if you wish.

Even without all that context, I still struggle to find a way to interpret the title the same way you did. Because of that, and I'm not to trying to start a fight, I actually found your comments about the title to be a bit aggressive (though not entitled).

1732,"Dunno if it's a ""fond"" memory, but I was in a class with Richard Hamilton and two or three other players at UCONN. It was a Spanish Literature in Translation course and, since the professor knew me, he asked me if I'd take notes for them when they missed class for away games and also tutor them when they needed it. I wasn't a very good note taker and wasn't sure I'd be good at tutoring; not willing to potentially contribute to some of our players becoming academically ineligible to play, I declined.

Over the course of several classes, I noticed that the players would read sports mags hidden inside textbooks all throughout the class. Once each class finished, the girl who ended volunteering to help out gave her very detailed notes to the players as they left. I'm glad I didn't choose to volunteer...for my sake and theirs.

1776,"Officially started keto this past week.° I'm not taking pictures and not looking at the scale (don't have one anyway). I'm just going by what I see looking down and looking in the mirror and by what I feel.

I know that might not work for everyone. For me it does because I'm committed to not being round anymore and I've found enough inspiration here to know what's possible and what it takes to get there.  

Also, I don't think a keto lifestyle is very hard to follow, including the 20g of net carbs to start it off, even though there's a lot of things I like that are off-limits (primarily pasta dishes). I mean, besides getting to have bacon and all that, I can still have dark chocolate (in moderation, unfortunately), for God's sake.

I'm throwing in some back care exercises, which focus in part on building core strength. It does feel like I've gotten ever-so-slightly slimmer/tighter in the middle and that in and of itself is exciting.

In any case, I guess this is all to say thanks to everyone here and the keto communities around the interwebs for the inspiration and the resources.

°I was already eating somewhat keto-friendly foods--also many not-so-friendly--in the past month and may have started going into ketosis a few times recently based on evidence such as feeling like tremendous crap (like I did earlier this week after starting for real) along with my urine smell changing and the oil slick left in my toilet after peeing.",2015-07-27 05:35:38+00:00,cthhbj8,2.0,t1_ctgx7kt,37427.0,keto
