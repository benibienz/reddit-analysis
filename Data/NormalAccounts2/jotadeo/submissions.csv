Although I'm not really paying attention to the scale since I'd rather focus on how I look and feel (and don't have a scale at home), I weighed myself at my friend's house yesterday and was at 225. Last time I weighed myself (on that same scale), I was at 242...and I'm sure put on several more pounds after that. 

Last week I was able to fit into the shirt I got married in (fairly casual, last-minute courthouse wedding while on vacation with family). Today I was able to comfortably put on a shirt I got during that vacation and I'm close to putting on some ""yeah, I'll fit into these someday"" shirts I got at the thrift store in the last couple of months.

How'd I get here? By eating around 20 net carbs a day without cheating at all...well, almost not at all. I probably went over a fair amount one day last week while at a three-day event without much time to prep my own food and the meal served that day had some pasta, but not too much. Yesterday was a big cheat day--had dinner with friends with some of my favorite dishes my wife makes. Hard to pass up some of those things, though I did skip the potato dish and limited my portions with the other stuff. Got right back on to good choices today.

Generally, my meals have been smaller as my body hasn't been craving lots of food. Being able to include dark chocolate has helped with cravings for ""sweets,"" which are more based on previous habits than on my body asking for it (i.e., time of day cravings).

I've only slightly increased my level of exercise and that's almost exclusively weight training and back-care exercises.

Thanks, /r/keto! Feel free to ask questions and I'll tell you what I can.",keto,"[SV] &amp; [NSV] After 4 weeks, at least 17 pounds down &amp; can now fit into clothes I'd nearly given up on",http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/3hdmk6/sv_nsv_after_4_weeks_at_least_17_pounds_down_can/
