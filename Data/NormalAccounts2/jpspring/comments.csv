I also gotta bring up Ozzie. Since 2012, how many times has he mentioned upgrading the secondary in the offseason. Jimmy is great, when healthy. And everyone knew wright was subpar. Webb was a hope and prayer cause his cap hit was too big to cut him.

 we have a top safety heading into his latter years, a top CB who has never been able to stay healthy. A possible top CB who didn't stay healthy who now plays a hard hitting strong safety position. A top rookie nickle playing starting CB. And a highschool teammate playing one on one on fucking dez.

We have to address this next year.

15,"Raised in Canada for 25 years. Closest nfl team were the Seahawks, well before they changed their jerseys/and had any success. More or less dry heaved everytime they were mentioned.

Was a big fan of the hometown CFL when the league did an American expansion in the early 90's. Las Vegas posse, Shreveport Pirates, Memphis Maddogs, Birmingham Barracudas and the Baltimore Colts/CFL'ers/Stallions. 

Most of the new teams were utterly terrible, with the exception of the Stallions, led by head coach Don Matthews. They ended up losing in the championship game, only to become the first (and only) US grey cup champions the following season. I'm sure many local people remember the odd success of the Stallions. They turned out to be something very special in the city.

During that final season, the other American teams more or less went bankrupt and closed down. The Stallions had all intentions to remain in Baltimore as the lone US team. This was when the NFL agreed to move the Cleveland Browns. 

The announcement was very early if you remember, as the very talented browns underwhelmed the rest of that year. Coincidentally, that early browns announcement came at the end of the CFL season.

Feel free to disagree, but I believe the nfl moved the browns the Baltimore, to squash the CFL's usa expansion. This is evident by allowing Cleveland to keep the browns records and giving Baltimore the expansion designation.  If you disagree, then tell me why the Houston oilers records live in Tennessee. Not to mention the cardinals, rams, raiders records.

Anyways, back to the point.. the Stallions ended up moving to Montreal and became the allouetts. They've enjoyed nearly two decades of winning football and many championships, including two under head coach Marc Trestman. 

I remember watching the first ravens game being somewhat sick to my stomach. Those feeling eventually passed and in 98 I chose to root for the ravens. I decided to look at the existence of the ravens as a nod to the CFL, and the city's efforts in forcing the NFL's hand. Football belongs in Baltimore, it took the Stallions for the NFL to realize that.

Two Superbowl later, with time lived in Houston and Pittsburgh, I'm still a ravens fan. Even tho ray Lewis was always kind of a douche. A big lovable douche. 

Much ravens love.

29,"I pay taxes on it and live in Katy.

The article is construing some of the info, and the title is absolutely wrong. This is a puff piece in the local newspaper obviously against the voted in stadium. In any event..

To be fair to the school district...The surplus money was interest gained on previous bonds over many years. Its money that is not part of the CURRENT Bond that updates old schools and adds new schools.  ...enough schools to accommodate the projected number of students in kISD over the bonds term.

That in mind, if  they are spending the extra cash, funding academics is a good decision to make. Especially in the eyes of the general public.

What I think is being lost in the article is the idea that 12 million goes a long way. The national average cost to build an elementary school is $316 per sqft. An average 75,000 sqft elementary school costs 24 million to construct. 

The article suggests that 12 million would fix Katy's current overcrowding issue by building more schools. When in reality, that money would literally build HALF a school. 

IMO the best thing to do with that 12 million is to keep it accruing interest. Even at 4 percent compounded interest over 20 years, totals 23 million. Thats pure interest, not any added principle. And not taking into consideration the interest made off each bond (how they made the 12 mill in the First place). At the end of the day, they could easily afford entire new Schools WITHOUT taxing a single resident. This should be common practice in all school divisions to help curb the cost of expansion/maintenance.

Obviously they didn't chose that and spent their investments on the stadium, but only AFTER holding public forums on what to do with the cash. Plus, It could be worse... They could have found easy ways to embezzle the unknown cash with new cars, big houses, expensive vacations...etc...

9 out if 10 doctors recommend camel cigarettes!

These were REAL ads when my parents were growing up. Just because your parents did it a certain way, doesn't necessarily mean it's also right for you. ..even if it didnt effect you negatively. 

For example, baby's in the 80's were to sleep on their stomachs, as per doctor's advice. This was found to be the leading cause of infant death syndrome. Now, sleeping on their backs, IDS has been reduced by over 65 percent since the switch.

Baby cams usually aren't about spying on your kids. And Tbh should never be about spying on your kids. It's about making sure they arent suffocating. Making sure they didn't fall out of their crib. Making sure they are still breathing. Etc... 

Now you can say, get off your lazy ass and just got check on them. But as any parent knows, time is of the essence. By watching in real-time, you can address a situation that is otherwise life threatening. On a side note, my first child woke up at the sound of the door opening, so having to put her back to sleep each time I checked on her would be a nightmare.

Im not saying everything your parents did was wrong, or everything we do is right. But for you and your kids sake, examine each method before simply disregarding potentially good advice. Keep an open mind, you may just learn something new.

If Wallace broke the bank, we are really in trouble. Don't forget, he came in here a washed up vet that hasn't been worth his salary for YEARS. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad to have him, but we shouldn't be paying him more then a 1 year vets minimum. 

We have had some great contracts written up and we have had some terrible ones. Hindsight is always 20/20 like on the original pitta deal, but we are pushing the cap partly becuase we are paying multiple players who aren't even on our roster anymore.

To say we couldn't have landed weddle if we kept KO isn't true. And if it is, we need to be in better control of our spending. There 100 different ways to make that deal happen. 

Flacco is admittedly overpaid, Webb's salary is killing us, if I'm correct We are still even paying off ray Rice's last year.

Over his career webb has been billed as an uber talented player. But in all honesty, he lived up to that potential in just a handful of games due to a plethora of season enders. The guy just couldn't stay healthy. 

Fact is, he didn't have the speed to player corner anymore and cap hit would have been too high to cut him, So the safety project began. Imo he would be playing nickel or sitting if Elam had stayed healthy. And that's saying something.

52,"i gotta disagree on guys going down...

The steelers have had their big time players out throughout the years many times and still won. In 2010 went without Ben for 4 games for rape allogations and went 3-1. They are also 6-3 without bell (suspensions and injuries over 3 years). AB really hasnt missed much time..

...We all know what the patriots did without Brady AND Rob Ninkovich.

The packers won the superbowl in 2010 with 16 players on IR.

Arizona barely skipped a beat with honey badgers ACL issues, and kept winning without Carson.

Bengals did the same with Aj mccarron when Red Rider went down.

Remember when flacco went down last year? I guess what im saying is our depth for years has been one of our strengths and since 2012, it has just been ugly. Promises and bloated reviews for players who just are not that good. like tandon doss, chykie brown, A.Q. Shipley,  Michael Campanaro,  Marlon Brown, Josh Bynes, Terrence Cody. I was pulling for these players, but in reality they just weren't NFL talent.

maybe im just venting.. but i just really dont see our team, beyond SOME of our starters anything more then average.

82,"20 to 60 is the total per field, not per player. Obviously different locations vary in costs. Also, most fields have a small one time fee to register.

Inter-league tournaments are very achievable, sooner rather then later. After a two month rotating schedule, all locations with sustainable numbers will host a weekly game, provided there is a willing player to act as the regional manager. (To set up and take down fields). To start, 4 tournaments will be held in rotating locations. (Spring,summer,fall, and winter)

Just like in your scenario, it would cost each player just a few dollars to play each week. One question would be what to do with excess funds collected. 

As it was incepted, Dropin football is a public organization. Any profits are strictly the participating public's, not mine, or any other volunteers.

I see them finishing 8-8 this year after a 6-2 start. in all honesty, a wild card spot would be a wildly successful season for this franchise.

In any event,  possibly due to limited news content of the time, I rarely heard of this injury in the NFL or CFL which I watched routinely. Keep in mind, This era had already been touted as ""athletes being stronger then ever.""

Fast forward, and it *seems* every few weeks someone is loosing thier season to an Achilles injury across different sports (see Kobe).

So what gives. Was I just missing the Injuries before? Or has something changed?

My current zeitgeist theory is focusing on footwear, which i believe to be the cause of my former injury. But, is it as simple as low tops vs high tops? Could it be Insoles? The pitch of the shoe itself? I'm still gathering the evidence, but something has caught my eye.. The last 6 NFL Achilles injury's have occurred while wearing the same UnderArmour cleat.

 Coincidence? Probably. But the hunt is still afoot. ...

Alicias or lupes - best Texmex.

Tacos a Bala - best Mexican.

Sherlocks - best ""english"" pub

Pizza sucks here (and most of Texas tbh). haven't been blown away by a Japanese, Chinese or Korean place either.
No Caribbean places, no African places, no Ukrainian or polish places (other then kolaches which are tech Czech.. but in all honesty it's more Hispanic food then authentic eastern European fare). I also haven't been impressed by any south american joints. ..but one thing Katy has a lot of is fucking mattress stores.

268,"Great question! Time commitment for a franchise owner is minimum 3 hours on game nights. This includes field setup, playing, field takedown and attending an *Afterhours* event following the game. Also, no more than 1 hour during the week may be required for league business via online meeting/emails. Lastly, any interleague tournaments or events may require your participation in some fashion.

Anytime beyond game days is completely optional as media and online advertising are handled by the league. You are more then welcome to do your own advertising as long as it falls under the leagues code of ethics.

The equipment is purchased through your expansion fee and is yours to keep and maintain. Any DropIn branded items such as t-shirts remain property of the league.

We could easily do multiple locations once this gets rolling, maybe have two locations rotating every week if that is better for peoples schedules. but first I'd like to see how many people actually show up to see if its worth it. 

Or, like you say, you could start a drop-in football game on the east side right away! That would be pretty cool. I'd love to help that happen if your willing to run it.  ",2016-04-13 21:17:38+00:00,d21plc5,4.0,t1_d21m76x,4199.0,dropinfootball

It's comical to think that the worlds greatest football coaches need 4 games to know if a player is a dud or not. Especially after years of scouting reports, seeing them all off-season and grinding them through training camp.
