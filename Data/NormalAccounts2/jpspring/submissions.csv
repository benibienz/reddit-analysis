1) Coming to a field near YOU! For the next two months, we will rotate through 6 different locations around Houston. Memorial Park, Katy City Park, Kieth Wiess Park, Sugarland, the Woodlands and South Houston/Galveston. The official schedule will be uploaded on Saturday.

2) Fees. Fml. Well Besides being field pirates (a popular opinion) we have no choice but to add a 5 dollar fee per player to play. It covers field rentals with lights each week. HERE IS THE GOOD NEWS... All excess funds will be announced in the game recap, and a running total will be published. We will use this extra money to improve the league. Establishing weekly locations, more equipment such as Flags and clean jerseys!, Hosting inter-league tournaments, entering state wide Flag football competition's, and obviously beer. The $5 fee is still the cheapest game in town and we remain non committal, so you only pay when you want to play.

3) After the two month rotating schedule, we will officially start up multiple weekly locations in areas that showed enough demand. A minimum of 10 players each week are required to cover costs at each location. Fields will be reserved 2 weeks in advance. If a location runs a loss for 2 weeks straight, it will loose its weekly game. 

4) Every location will have a local bar associated with it for drinks after the game.

5) We will not do a special Saturday kickoff party for the fall season. We will focus instead on throwing a killer season ending tournament in January. The tournament will be open to regular dropin's and pre registered teams of 8 players.

Simply put, we found ourselves in a situation of censorship that I believe to be in direct violation of the Subreddits and Reddit itself. After a brief dialog with the powers that be, it became evident that distancing our relationship with these Subreddits was in DropIn Football's best interests.

The Semi-pros finished 28-24 where speed was the name of the game! Another close Beer Leaguers game ended on an interception to secure a victory for the skins.

Unfortunately, we will have no pictures up this week on Reddit for you to drool over, but follow our [Instagram @Dropinfootball]( https://www.instagram.com/dropinfootball/) to get a few of the highlights over the next week.

Big shout out to No Label once again for the brews. Until next week…

Lets give a hand to the Morton Ranch High School Groundskeepers for supplying us with an unlimited supply of cool refreshing water throughout the first half of our game. Sprinklers on fleek.

Once again y'all showed up in groves and hit a new high of 40 participants. Next week we'll be running a third game (with full pylons btw) to accommodate all you beautiful bastards.

The Semi-Pro game was a lopsided affair until a manufactured comeback by the Yellow team brought the game to a tie in the  closing seconds, Unfortunately for the Guava's, the Blueberries had too much firepower an handily won the game in OT.

A lot of fun was had in our Beer League game, where the score always means nothing (the Yellow-jackets won 28-21) Large variety of folks got a chance to play, but Duel MVP goes to the two little men both scoring 2 touchdowns and [breaking ankles](https://gfycat.com/MeanOilyDrafthorse) along the way. A lot of new faces in this one with everyone having a great time.

Dan helped put on an awesome night at No Label with some free pizza and of course some tasty NL beer! If you haven't got a chance to thank him, make sure to buy him a pint next week! Speaking of thanking people, Tia and Jon donated their time to take some dope action shots during last nights games. [Check out all of the amazing photos here!](http://imgur.com/a/0eOMY)

**PREVIOUS LOCATION REQUESTS**

Killercam1001 - Southeast Deer Park Laporte area plenty of fields around here so no preference. Is there anyway to move the location weekly or monthly to accommodate more people? Some of us live on the south east side lol

mmchingon - Northeast Houston area? Keith Weiss park would be a great spot... anyone? bueller?

pville - Southside, Pearland, Pasadena, League city, somewhere in that area would be awesome, id go every week! think a good location could be at 9500 Hall Rd Houston, TX Its along the beltway and close to 45. 

clutchcityslicker - If there are any pick up games on the south side of town from 288 to 225 I have several people that would be down. I can't start an expansion, but if someone in the area wants to then I can participate. Once school starts up at the end of august I am not sure how available I'll be at that point week in and week out. Have you heard of anyone starting it up in my area?

Lewtheax - Do y'all have any plans to get a game started ITL (inside 610)?

BrokeNoCoke - Near the Lone star North harris and kingwood area

Tenglishbee - This sounds like a blast. Too bad I'm in shitty shitty San Antonio. I know a few people that would want to play too.

clubalkek - I...I live in San marcos

thewhitewhisper - Yes please dooo. I would be interested also - For San Antonio

OB1Rebelrbl - I live in San Marcos can I get in on a messaging list for this? Would love to go.

elpoutous - I'm in San Antonio, ill help any way i can!

minh316 - Have y'all considered also having games on days other than Thursday? Me and a few buddy's have been wanting to play but work on Thursdays. Monday and Friday's are usually good. We all live in the Katy and Cypress area.

BMOOrbitalBobcat - It's times like these that I detest living in Lubbock. Normally it's just a mild rage.

dseals - We can start our own league, with blackjack and hookers. In fact, forget the league! - Lubbock

at_work_safe_acct - I want to go so bad, if you guys ever do anything in the loop I'm there.

drainoltx - Maybe we should create our own league. With blackjack and hookers. - Greenway Plaza

Oakley-Guy15 - I'd be able to join if it were inside the loop as well. My roommate would probably play too.

simmonsg - If you guys ever have a game in Houston, I'll be there.

mattjeast - Damnit! This is just a couple of miles from where I grew up. I live in Austin now. Sigh.

AllStarDevil - How bout bringing it near Denver Harbor? :3

vitamincheme - At first I was like ""neat"" and then I was like ""that's nowhere near houston"" - Norhill

aussie_jason - This should be in - Oak Forest

gamesterdude - Dallas bro is sad he can't play 😭😭

Mezzanot - Too far a drive from College Station...

InTheBreadbasket I wish it wasn't so far away. I'd love to join. - Kingwood.

SarahHasJuice - awwwww man I don't get in katy till 8. You guys have fun! Ill be checking to see if you guys do any weekend games because I live in katy but work in the woodlands.

BeerBurpKisses - over off 45n and Parker by the gallery furniture.

TellMeToMyCrotch - Damn, sounds like a blast. Unfortunately I'm down in League City.

Jermaphobe - Encouraging people to car pool as I see a lot of people come from quite a ways off. I personally come from the woodlands area down 45 and then to I10.

frkn - I live in midtown and work at NASA, going out to Katy on a workday is just too much driving lol. Have fun and drink a cold one for me

tmckerch - Also a game out in college station would be a great idea. Could easily get enough people out here

Youngarigold - is there one in Austin? I would love it

Our new divisions kicked off with a bang last night! The Beer Leaguer's decided to let a new father/son duo rack up big play after big play. Meanwhile, the ultra competitive Semi-Pro's couldn't finish the game without some high flying drama! Was he in? Was he out? [...It was pretty obvious](http://www.thesportsbank.net/core/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Replacement-Refs.jpg)

Speaking of the ref's, special mention to Andrew our Unofficial Referee for scoring a 40 yard touchdown off some dudes foot. ...Sometimes hero's dont wear capes. ...On that note, expect to wear a striped cape next week.

With countless big plays being made, this weeks MVP has to go to our very own ""julian edelman"" for deciding to pillage and plunder that poor little first down marker over and over and over.

We have increased to TWO games throughout the event since GRMD is expecting **hundreds** of people in attendance. Our Afternoon game runs from 4-5 PM with our Prime Time affair kicking off at 7 PM.
Space will be extremely limited due to a roster cap of 28 players per game. You must reserve a spot in person at the event, simply find our table and sign up to ensure you’re on a roster.

Both games will take place right at the [site]( https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1EBDW4wcUAMdKJ978jPus0eblcUM) of GRMD. This gives you the fantastic option to saunter over to us during the game. We will be playing on a somewhat modified field, surrounded by large oak trees, which may prove ideal hiding spots for our lurker friends in attendance. 

[Per the norm]( https://www.reddit.com/r/dropinfootball/comments/4mlg4a/welcome_to_drop_in_click_here_for_the_deets/), everything will be provided for you and is 100% free. Each team will be required to wear some ugly pinnies during the game. **Or…. For the first time ever, you have the option to purchase your very own DropIn Football Game Shirts that you can wear each week to our events!** Please note that this is a very limited print of T-shirt with limited sizing options. Purchase a shirt at our signup table.

I have to give an amazingly HUGE shoutout to [No Label Brewery]( http://nolabelbrew.com/) for donating 2 kegs to GRMD. As you may know, we host our *Afterhours @ No Label* right at the brewery. They are some incredible folk which put on [Houston’s best block party]( http://nolabelbrew.com/tours-tastings/) every Saturday, hands down!

With all this excitement, don’t forget about our normally scheduled Thursday evening game!! This week we officially kick off our [new divisions]( https://www.reddit.com/r/dropinfootball/comments/4okheu/dropin_just_got_a_little_bigger/) to give people maximum playing time! 

I can’t tell you how stoked I am to rock this year’s GRMD with you amazing Houstonians!

Through our continued growth we find ourselves in need of two games at our current location instead of one. Our new setup provides an opportunity for everyone to get more involved, while leveling out the playing field slightly.

Our **Beer League** division will continue to host a fun loving crowd that is looking for something a little lighter.

The **Semi-Pro** division caters to those who's competitive nature burns for a faster paced environment. 

Both divisions are still free and non-committal. The game rules remain the same and you're able to change divisions from week to week.

After the games both groups are invited to *Afterhours @ No Label* to share in a cold pint and some food truck munchies!

Looking forward to kicking off the new format this upcoming Thursday!

The Skins pulverized the Blueberries 28-0 before the half, sparking a few wiley trades during the break. It payed dividends as the blue team outperformed the shirt team during a much closer second half.

There was some great discussion regarding a few rule changes during *Afterhours* @ **No Label**. Keep your eyes posted to the sub for some pretty exciting news later today...

A big shoutout to everyone who came out last night and witnessed the blueberry's steamrolling of the skins! After shooting out to an early lead the Blue Team fended off any comeback attempts from the Shirt Team with a number of interceptions. 

For game MVP, I gotta give it up to the little dude who hit his first 2 point convert and capped of the night with a 50 yard TD! Kid is going places.

*Afterhours* @ **No Label** had a great showing with plenty of laughs to be had. From the looks of it drink of choice was NLB's Elda M milk stout. Although, I stuck to my blondes with their First Street Ale.

Alright, back to the goods. Each week a diverse group of people choose between the **BEER LEAGUE's** non competitive game and the **SEMI-PRO's** ultra fast game. It really doesn't matter what your skill level is, you can just DropIn and play. Oh, and if you don't know how to play football and/or tl;dr the rules, even better, come learn it live.

You are not required to bring anything specific. Water is good, Beer is probably better, but save that for our *Afterhours @ [No Label Brewery](http://nolabelbrew.com/)* immediately following the game. Point is, we provide everything for you to be able to play. ..And *when* you show up looking like the [rookie](http://imgur.com/gallery/3rWBM1p) we all know you truly are, just purchase some [swiggity swag](http://imgur.com/NZ8K8LD) at the game, so you can be [ballin](http://imgur.com/F6zrAkM) too.. 

As for the weather, if [Ollie Williams](http://drag0ndud3.deviantart.com/art/it-s-gon-rain-512997530) says its gon' rain, then the game is cancelled. ..Thunderstorms for that matter too. If you are unsure of the game status, just check the [feed](http://dropinfootball.com) on Thursday's for cancellation notices.

Now, without further ado... here are the game rules:

**GAME RULES**

*Field Dimensions*

A. Field Length - 100 yards long

B. Field Width - 53 Yards wide

C. End Zones - 10 yards deep


*Starting the game*

1. Two appointed captains throw down in a epic battle of Rock-Paper-Scissors that goes mostly unnoticed. The winner gets the first draft pick to build their team. Captains alternate picks until all players are chosen. Late players will be added in as they arrive. The winning captain gets first possession and starts the game on Offense. 

2. The losing captain gets nothing.

3. There are no referees. All play is peer reviewed and relies on good sportsmanship.

4. Each team will field 7 Players: 

A. Offense - 1 Quarterback, 1 Center, 5 Wide Receivers.

B. Defense - 1 Rusher. 6 Defensive Backs

5. Player substitutions are a good idea

*Moving the ball*

1. Possession begins at the offense's own 20 yard line

2. The Line of Scrimmage is marked with a RED beanbag. The First Down Marker is a YELLOW bean bag. The offense must gain at least 10 yards in 4 or less plays or the defense takes over. The QB is responsible for setting up the beanbag prior to the start of the next play.

3. There will be an area referred to as the tackle box that extends five yards on both sides of the center and extends five yards deep into the backfield. No receiver may line up within the tackle box prior to the snap.

4. There is NO blocking permitted. 

5. All offensive plays must be forward passes. (No Run plays or Kicking/Punting plays)

6. The Center is an eligible receiver. The ball must be snapped from the ground between the center's legs.

7. No “Double Passes” are allowed.

8. Once a forward pass has been thrown, a backward pass (lateral) is allowed.

9. The ball carrier is legally down when touched with one or both hands.

10. The defense will have a single rusher, lined up 10 yards behind the line of scrimmage at a BLUE bean bag. The rusher is responsible for resetting the bean bag prior to the start of the next play.

11. The QB must remain behind the line of scrimmage until the Rusher crosses the LOS in pursuit.

12. Interceptions may be returned, however returning team must not pursue the play. They may not block for or screen for the runner.

13. Fumbles are dead balls at the spot with the offense retaining possession. A muffed snap is not a dead ball.


*Time*

1. A central time keeper will be lurking about. All games will begin and end on their instruction. They will also announce any breaks in play and the 2 minute warning (7:58 pm).

2. No quarters, halves or halftime. Unless it's crazy hot out and we're super duper thirsty.

3. No timeouts, we are all adults here.

4. No play-clock.

5. No delay of game penalties.

*Scoring*

1. 6 points for TD

2. 1 point for PAT from 5 yard line, 2 point PAT from 10 yard line.

3. 2 points if the defense returns an intercepted PAT across the opposing goal line.

4. Score is kept by all willing players during the game.

*Ties*

1. Are awesome.

*Extended Rules*

1. No blocking, biting, kicking, punching or scratching. Pinching, tweaking and that classic football Butt-Slap are frowned upon as well. ..unless that's your thing, but use those handy dandy judgement skills.

2. Excessive force will be penalized by automatic first down plus 15 yards from the spot of the foul. Ejection of a player(s) if ruled unsportsmanlike/flagrant).

7. Blatant Defensive Pass Interference is an automatic 1st down &amp; spot foul. Responsibility to avoid contact is with the defense. There will be NO deliberate bumping or grabbing.

8. Offensive pass interference is a 10 yard penalty.

10. Offensive team is responsible for retrieving and returning the ball to the previous spot or the new scrimmage spot in a timely fashion.

12. Fighting: Any player(s) involved will be ejected from the game and ALL future games permanently. If a team fight occurs, then we should probably all reevaluate our s***.

And there you have it. Simple enough, so come out, relive those Uncle Rico football years and share a pint with us afterwards.

See y'all at Dropin!

1.	Field Length - 50 yards long
2.	Field Width - 53 Yard Wide
3.	End Zone - 10 yards deep


Starting the game

1.	A central time keeper will probably be designated.  All games will begin and end on their instruction.  They will also announce the time remaining at the 2 minute mark (7:58 pm).
2.	Two captains will be chosen prior to the start of the game. These captains will play one intense round of Rock Paper Scissors. Glory goes to the winner in the form of first pick of the remaining players to build his/her team. The captains will alternate picks until all players are chosen. Late players will be added in an alternating fashion.
3.	The loser captain at RPS gets first possession and will start the game on Offense. His/her team will also wear some epic colored pinnies that will distinguish them apart.
5.	There are no referees. All play is peer reviewed and will rely on good sportsmanship. So, don't be a dick.
6.	Each team will field 8 Players: Offense - 1 Quarterback, 1 Center, 6 Wide Receivers. Defense - 1 Designated QB rusher. 7 Defensive Backs
7.     Player substitutions are also a good idea


Moving the ball

1.	All offensive plays must be passes. (No Run plays or Kicking/Punting plays)
2.	The field is marked at 10 yard intervals with cones. The offense must gain at least 10 yards in the 3 or less plays or the defense takes over.
3.	Possession always begins at the 50 yard line, in the middle of the field.
4.	No penalties will be assessed in excess of the 50 yard line.   
5.	Offenses always moves in the same direction.
6.	No “Double Passes” are allowed.
7.	Once a forward pass has been thrown, a backward pass (lateral) is allowed.
8.	Should a swing pass not cross the LOS and a defensive player tags the ball carrier behind the 50 yard line, it is a safety. (Defense scores 2 points and gets the ball)
9.	There will be an area referred to as the tackle box that extends 5 yards on both sides of the center and extends 5 yards deep into the backfield.  No receiver may line up within the tackle box prior to the snap.


Time

1.	No halves, just a two minute warning at 7:58 pm.
2.	No timeouts, we are all adults here.


Scoring

1.	6 points for TD
2.	1 point for PAT from 5 yard line, 2 point PAT from 10 yard line.
3.	2 points if the defense returns an intercepted PAT back across the 50 yard line.
4.	Score is kept by all willing players during the game.


Ties 

1.	Are awesome.


Special Rules

1.	No blocking, biting, kicking, punching or scratching. Pinching, tweaking and the Classic Football Butt-Slap are frowned upon as well. ..unless that's your thing, but use those handy dandy judgement skills.
2.	Receiver/Ball carrier is legally down when touched with one or both hands.  (Excessive force will be penalized by automatic first down and 5 yards.  Ejection of a player(s) if ruled unsportsmanlike &amp; flagrant).
3.	Fumbles are dead balls at the spot with the offense retaining possession.  A muffed snap is not a fumble/dead ball.
4.	There are no delay of game penalties.
5.	The defense will have a single rusher, lined up 10 yards behind the line of scrimmage. A bean bag will mark the 10 yard rushing line. The rusher is responsible for setting up the beanbag prior to the start of the next play.
6.	The QB must remain behind the line of scrimmage with intent to pass until the defensive rusher crosses the LOS in pursuit.
7.	Blatant Defensive Pass Interference is an automatic 1st down &amp; spot foul. Responsibility to avoid contact is with the defense.  There will be NO deliberate bumping or grabbing. 
8.	Offensive pass interference is a 10 yard penalty.      
9.	Interceptions may be returned (“no blocking” rule applies).  If an interception is returned beyond the 50 yard line, it is a touchdown and PAT should ensue.  The teammates of the person who intercepted must not pursue the play. They may not block for or screen for the runner.
10.	Offensive team is responsible for retrieving and returning the ball to the previous spot or the new scrimmage spot in a timely fashion.
11.	The offensive center is an eligible receiver.  The ball can be snapped from the ground between the snapper’s legs or standing up, and tossed behind the centers back. The offensive center is responsible for setting or re-positioning bean bag to mark the line of scrimmage.
13.	Fighting:  Any player(s) involved will be ejected from the game and any future game permanently.  If a team fight occurs, then we should probably all reevaluate our shit.
