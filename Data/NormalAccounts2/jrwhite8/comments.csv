&gt; ...

And issue by issue, whether it is climate change, whether it is Citizens United, the need to overturn that, whether it is pay equity for women, whether it is raising the minimum wage to a living wage, rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, a tax system that says to Trump and his friends they are going start paying their fair share of taxes, look at Clinton’s positions, look at Trump’s positions, understand that one or the other of those two will be the next president of the United States. And after you take a hard look at those two candidates and their issues, I think the conclusion that the vast majority of people will reach is that Clinton is far and away the superior candidate.” -Bernie Sanders [source](https://www.yahoo.com/news/bernie-sanders-on-gary-johnson-212251450.html)",2016-11-07 15:41:22+00:00,d9pn3re,5.0,t1_d9pmlw0,661.0,politics

125,"Certainly one of the, if not the main, goals of the ACA was to decrease the number of uninsured Americans, and it has certainly done so. In 2010, the year it passed, the uninsured rate was over 15% according to the [CDC's National Health Interview Survey](http://www.forbes.com/sites/dandiamond/2015/08/12/for-first-time-americas-uninsured-rate-is-below-10/#752a5c94741c) (it's been as high as 18% in past years). In 2015, that number fell to below 10% (9.2%, to be specific).

In terms of affordability, while some have seen rises in premiums (mostly in states with fewer insurance companies/less competition, and ones that turned down federal funding to expand Medicaid), most people have seen lower costs due to subsidies according to the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/10/27/us/is-the-affordable-care-act-working.html?_r=0#affordability).
&gt;Eighty-five percent of those who signed up during the enrollment period qualified for federal subsidies to help pay premiums. For those who qualified for subsidies through the federal exchange, the subsidies lowered the cost by 76 percent on average, according to the Obama administration.

A recent [Commonwealth Fund study](http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/press-releases/2015/jan/biennial-health-insurance-survey) found that in 2014 (the first year the ACA exchanges were in effect), fewer Americans had problems paying medical bills or medical debt, and fewer went without care because they couldn’t afford it. This is the first decline and lowest level in these areas since 2005.

In fact, if one were to look at the trend in health premium growth, just looking at the fact that premiums rise each year does not give the full picture. Health premium growth [slowed to its lowest rate ever recorded in 2013 &amp; 2014](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/12/03/us-health-spending-grows-at-lowest-rate/19830573/) and has continued to be low (4.2%) through [2015](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/09/22/new-data-show-slow-health-care-cost-growth-continuing). A decade ago, most plans were seeing [double-digit increases](http://kff.org/health-costs/report/2014-employer-health-benefits-survey/).
&gt;Employer-sponsored health insurance premiums grew more slowly in 31 states and the District of Columbia between 2010 and 2013 -- after the passage of Obamacare -- compared with 2003 to 2010, according to the nonpartisan foundation the Commonwealth Fund.
–[CBS News](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/study-premium-growth-slowed-after-obamacare/)

Additionally, the ACA has found many areas to cut medical costs with new efficiencies and more effective treatment methods, with the ACOs generating a [combined $417 million in savings for Medicare](https://www.cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/Fact-sheets/2014-Fact-sheets-items/2014-11-10.html). The law also requires insurers to spend [80-85% of premium dollars on actual healthcare](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/FR-2011-12-07/2011-31289/content-detail.html), rather than administrative costs or profit.
&gt;Health-care providers receive financial rewards for cutting costs and penalties for bad care, such as when patients have to be readmitted to hospital after they have been discharged or when they catch nasty infections in a clinic. Between January 2012 and December 2013 there have been 150,000 fewer readmissions among Medicare patients—an 8% decline. The law also requires greater price transparency.
&gt;Overall the CBO projects that, if the law is unchanged, net federal spending for the government’s main health-care programmes in 2039 will be 8% of GDP, about 15% less than had been projected in 2010. Projections for Medicare and Medicaid spending between 2011-2020 have been revised downwards by $1.1 trillion. The government also claims that since 2011 some 50,000 fewer patients died in hospitals as a result of Obamacare. Far from bankrupting the nation, as its critics predicted, Obamacare may be making medicine thriftier.
–[The Economist](http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21645855-growth-americas-health-care-spending-slowing-will-obamacare-cut-costs)

This combined with the fact that the ACA [prohibits insurers from denying coverage for people with pre-existing conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act#Overview_of_provisions) and [prohibits insurers from charging more for insurance based on gender](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/the_aca_helps_women.pdf), all while maintaining a minimum quality standard for coverage.

It's far from a perfect law (when has any law of this size and scope ever been?), but I would call it a qualified success at its goals of lowering the number of uninsured, increasing access to quality healthcare, reducing healthcare costs, and yes, on the whole keeping healthcare premiums affordable and helping to slow the rate of premium increases to 50-year lows.",2016-07-28 07:57:43+00:00,d5u6jz3,1.0,t3_4usp1b,101656.0,PoliticalDiscussion

143,"Firstly, while many people look back at Don't Ask Don't Tell as a negative (and certainly today’s full acceptance of gays in the armed forces is much better), in the early 1990s that was actually a win against outright banning gays in the military. Bill Clinton [actually campaigned on ending the ban on gays in the military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_ask,_don%27t_tell#Origin), spent a lot of political capital on the issue, and this was the compromise they could reach.

I do give Bernie Sanders a lot of credit for voting against DOMA, though he and his wife said at the time that it was because of states’ rights. ""We're not legislating values."" ([source](http://time.com/4089946/bernie-sanders-gay-marriage/)) I do think Sanders has a pretty strong record on gay rights, so I don't think there's a need to distort it.

Hillary Clinton has a pretty good, if imperfect, record on gay rights. Here's a post I made listing some [major bullets from her record](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4il74w/clinton_in_1992_id_be_considered_conservative_in/d309yo2).

&gt; He's been campaigning for equality since literally the early 80s when he was mayor of Burlington.

Then why, when serving as mayor of Burlington, did Sanders tell an interviewer that LGBT rights were not a “major priority” for him? Asked if he would support a bill to protect gays from job discrimination, Sanders responded, “probably not.” [source](http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2015/10/05/bernie_sanders_on_marriage_equality_he_s_no_longtime_champion.html)

Why, in 2009, did Sanders [vote in favor the ""Brownback Amendment""](http://library.cqpress.com/cqalmanac/file.php?path=Floor%20Votes%20Tables/2009_Senate_Floor_Votes_230-233.pdf) which added an anti-gay religious liberty exemption to the [Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Shepard_and_James_Byrd_Jr._Hate_Crimes_Prevention_Act#Senate)?

And why, from 2000-2009, did he shy away from taking a stand on gay marriage? Why did he avoid answering the question when asked? Why was he pushing for civil unions at the time, the same thing Hillary Clinton supported then?

&gt; It wasn’t until 2009 that Sanders publicly voiced support for gay marriage, years after many of his contemporaries in Vermont.

&gt; ...

&gt; Peter Freyne, a locally beloved Vermont writer and opinion writer whom Sanders later lauded as “the best political reporter in the state of Vermont,” accused the then-Congressman of obfuscating on his gay rights position.

&gt; “Obtaining Congressman Bernie Sanders’ position on the gay marriage issue was like pulling teeth … from a rhinoceros,” Freyne wrote. Freyne described repeated attempts to hear Sanders’ views on gay marriage, and the congressman only said he “supports the current process” in the state legislature. Though Sanders was not in the Vermont state legislature at the time, it was a hot topic in his home state at the time.

&gt; “It’s an election year, yet despite the lack of a serious challenger, The Bern’s gut-level paranoia is acting up,” Freyne wrote. [source](http://time.com/4089946/bernie-sanders-gay-marriage/)

&gt; ""When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.

You can quibble about whether or not Trump's statement on its face is racist or not, but the above quote seems to apply that only a small amount of these illegal immigrants (he assumes) are good people. When from a crime standpoint, the facts suggest it's actually an extremely small percentage ([around 1.6%](http://immigrationpolicy.org/special-reports/criminalization-immigration-united-states)) of illegal immigrants that commit non-immigration-related crimes. But his statements are stoking the longstanding fear that immigrants/foreigners = dangerous.

From the Washington Post: ""Trump’s repeated statements about immigrants and crime underscore a common public perception that crime is correlated with immigration, especially illegal immigration. But that is a misperception; no solid data support it, and the data that do exist negate it. Trump can defend himself all he wants, but the facts just are not there.""

I wasn't commenting on the email issue overall (I'll leave that to the FBI and DOJ). I was only commenting on the parts of it that were included in the video, such as her ""90-95%"" remark. And I just pointed out that the vast majority of her email correspondence was to state.gov addresses and that Colin Powell used the same rationale when defending his use of a private AOL account for part of his job as SoS, saying that, ""A lot of the emails that came out of my personal account went into the State Department system. They were addressed to State Department employees and state.gov domain."" [source](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/colin-powell-hillary-clinton-email-state-department-115870)

&gt; No. As of March of last year, Bill Clinton did not use email.

Thank you for the sources. I looked into it some more, and it turns out that the quote I cited of Bill talking about sending other emails was later corrected to be him actually [talking about texting](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/10/bill-clinton-gets-his-own-email-scandal.html) (old people, am I right...?).

Looking into it further, it seems that Hillary Clinton was most likely referring to emailing with Bill through his staff. Just because Bill doesn't personally write emails doesn't mean people cannot correspond with him through his assistants via email. Here's just one example from her many emails with Bill's assistants:

229,"I posted this the last time this video made the front page, so here I go again:

The only out-and-out lie I see in this video is the Bosnia sniper fire story. Don’t know what that was about. The rest of the video is a combination of changes on certain positions, old quotes taken out of context, nuanced stances, and semantic debates.

* **Gay marriage**: Yes, Hillary Clinton was against it before, and was [instead for civil unions with full benefits](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/17/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-change-position-same-sex-marriage/) (Bernie Sanders similarly [advocated for civil unions over fighting to legalize gay marriage](http://time.com/4089946/bernie-sanders-gay-marriage/)). And let's remember that [Sanders did not support gay marriage until 2009](http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2015/10/05/bernie_sanders_on_marriage_equality_he_s_no_longtime_champion.html), and only after Vermont legalized it. Like many people in politics, including President Obama (and much of the country in general), she evolved on the issue of gay marriage and now supports it. There’s a change in position here, but I don’t see where the lie is.

* **Progressive vs. Moderate**: I don’t understand the importance of this semantic debate between progressive and moderate. First of all, I don’t believe these terms are mutually exclusive. One can be a moderate progressive, just as one can be a moderate conservative. Secondly, [according to an analysis of roll call votes by Voteview](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/hillary-clinton-was-liberal-hillary-clinton-is-liberal/), Clinton’s record was more liberal than 70 percent of Democrats in her final term in the Senate. She was more liberal than 85 percent of all members (including more liberal than Senator Obama). [OnTheIssues.org rates Clinton as a “hard core liberal”](http://www.ontheissues.org/hillary_clinton.htm), as liberal as [Elizabeth Warren](http://www.ontheissues.org/senate/Elizabeth_Warren.htm) and barely more moderate than [Bernie Sanders](http://www.ontheissues.org/house/Bernie_Sanders.htm). To say that one fights for [progressive values](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/hillary-clinton-was-liberal-hillary-clinton-is-liberal/) while also trying to find common ground and areas in which actual progress can be made doesn’t seem like a negative to me. As they say, don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.

* **Emails: 90-95%**: Let’s put aside the fact that the only two other Secretaries of State to use email before Sec. Clinton also [used private email accounts on which they received “classified” information](http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/04/politics/hillary-clinton-email-classified-colin-powell-condoleezza-rice/). She may have been incorrect that the 90-95% figure came from the State Department, but that doesn’t make the number itself untrue. The vast majority of emails sent and received were to others with State Department email addresses, meaning those emails would be [in the State Dept. system](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/us/hillary-clinton-emails-take-long-path-to-controversy.html?_r=0). In fact, this was [Colin Powell's same rationale](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/colin-powell-hillary-clinton-email-state-department-115870) for freely and independently deleting all of the emails from his personal AOL (!) account that he used while SoS: ""I don’t have any to turn over. I did not keep a cache of them. I did not print them off. I do not have thousands of pages somewhere in my personal files. A lot of the emails that came out of my personal account went into the State Department system. They were addressed to State Department employees and state.gov domain...""

* **Emails: Piles of Libya Emails**: Seriously? Where’s the lie?

* **Emails: Bill’s Two Emails**: EDIT: Turns out that [Bill actually meant he was texting](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/10/bill-clinton-gets-his-own-email-scandal.html) in that quote I previously cited. In looking into it further, it appears Hillary Clinton would frequently email Bill through his assistants. Just because Bill doesn't personally write emails doesn't mean people cannot correspond with him through his assistants via email. Here's just [one example](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/07/01/hillary-clinton-emails_n_7708822.html):

&gt; Bill Clinton's Assistant: ""We are doing letter. Also have a number if you want to call. Wjc [William Jefferson Clinton] is supposed to call as well.""

&gt; Hillary Clinton: ""Where is Bill? Can I call his cell or Doug's?""

* **On Wall Street: “Blaming” Homebuyers**: I wrote [a whole other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/47deig/how_is_this_video_of_clinton_blaming_homeowners/d0c59kd) addressing this purposefully misleading out-of-context clip.

* **On Wall Street: Investment Banks**: One’s opinion on big money in politics aside, let’s look at what’s happening in this particular instance. At this particular debate, Hillary Clinton (not Bernie Sanders) is bringing up the risk that investment banks specifically pose. If the logic is that being in the pocket of an investment bank means favorable treatment, why would she call out investment banks? Also, where’s the lie? And on a side note, Hillary Clinton’s Wall Street plan has received praise from many economists and many on the left, including [Elizabeth Warren](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/12/07/elizabeth-warren-praises-hillary-clintons-wall-street-plan/).

* **On Universal Healthcare**: Hillary Clinton doesn’t agree that Single Payer is the best way to achieve universal healthcare in this country (especially after the protracted battle we’ve had over the last 7 years), and instead favors improvements to the ACA to cover the remaining 9-10% of uninsured Americans, including reviving the [public option](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/health-care/). She's been [fighting for universal healthcare since 1993](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_health_care_plan_of_1993) and never once proposed Single Payer. Lots of people seem to think that “Single Payer” is synonymous with Universal Healthcare, or that it’s the only way to achieve it, and that’s [simply not true](http://www.forbes.com/sites/danmunro/2013/12/08/universal-coverage-is-not-single-payer-healthcare/#60a15fc47f5d).

* **NAFTA**: It’s almost as if she has a mixed opinion of NAFTA, and nuanced opinions on free trade in general. It seems to me that she believes in free trade agreements in principle, if not always in the way they’re implemented, and learned from NAFTA the importance of adding protections for American jobs. So yes, as First Lady, she spoke favorably of NAFTA, though by 1998 she was already [publicly expressing concerns about it](http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/04/21/401123124/a-timeline-of-hillary-clintons-evolution-on-trade): “I would add that there does need to be sensitivity to worker and environmental concerns in trade agreements going forward in the future.” According to [Politifact](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/25/barack-obama/clinton-has-changed-on-nafta/), “We should note that Clinton biographer Sally Bedell Smith has said that as first lady, Clinton opposed NAFTA privately but supported it publicly because it was important to her husband politically.” Many of the clips and quotes included in the video also often have her expressing some concern about it, though of course those parts are cut out. In 2000, she said, “What happened to NAFTA, I think, was we inherited an agreement that we didn't get everything we should have got out of it in my opinion. I think the NAFTA agreement was flawed. The problem is we have to go back and figure out how we are going to fix that.” Then the video takes the following 2004 quote out of context: “I think on balance NAFTA has been good for New York and America, but I also think that there are a number of areas where we're not dealt with in an upfront way in dealing with our friend to the north, Canada, which seems to be able to come up with a number of rationales for keeping New York agricultural products out of Canada.” Then in 2007, “I believe in the general principles it represented, but what we have learned is that we have to drive a tougher bargain. Our market is the market that everybody wants to be in. We should quit giving it away so willy-nilly. I believe we need tougher enforcement of the trade agreements we already have. You look at the trade enforcement record between the Clinton Administration and the Bush Administration, the Clinton Administration brought more trade enforcement actions in one year than the Bush Administration brought in six years. For me, trade is who we are. We're traders. We want to be involved in the global economy, but not be played for suckers… Look, NAFTA did not do what many had hoped, and so we do need to take a look at it and we do need to figure out how we're going to have trade relations that are smart, that give the American worker and the American consumer rights around the world.” And most recently with the TPP, yes she supported it in principle, but once the language was actually finalized, she felt that it [fell short](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-singh-grewal/why-hillary-clinton-is-ri_b_8295420.html). “It was just finally negotiated last week, and in looking at it, it didn't meet my standards. My standards for more new, good jobs for Americans, for raising wages for Americans. And I want to make sure that I can look into the eyes of any middle-class American and say, ‘this will help raise your wages.’ And I concluded I could not.” [source](http://www.ontheissues.org/2016/Hillary_Clinton_Free_Trade.htm)

She said nothing of the sort. Terry Gross asked if Hillary Clinton secretly was in favor of gay marriage all along but didn't say so publicly for political reasons, and Hillary Clinton said no, that she actually had a change of opinion on this issue.

&gt; Terry Gross: ""You know I’m just saying, I’m sorry – I just want to clarify what I was saying – no, I was saying that you maybe really believed this all along, but, you know believed in gay marriage all along, but felt for political reasons America wasn’t ready yet and you couldn’t say it. That’s what I was thinking.""

&gt; Clinton: ""No. That is not true.""

&gt; Gross: ""Okay.""

&gt; Clinton: ""I did not grow up even imagining gay marriage and I don’t think you did either. This was an incredible new and important idea that people on the front lines of the gay right movement began to talk about and slowly, but surely, convinced others about the rightness of that position. When I was ready to say what I said, I said it.""

&gt; Gross: ""Okay, thank you for clarifying that."" [source](http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=321313477)

But that doesn’t mean that those who join later, in being publically supportive or even privately accepting that there needs to be change, are any less committed.

* **On Universal Healthcare**: Hillary Clinton doesn’t agree that Single Payer is the best way to achieve universal healthcare in this country (especially after the protracted battle we’ve had over the last 7 years), and instead favors improvements to the ACA to cover the remaining 9-10% of uninsured Americans, including reviving the [public option](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/health-care/). She's been [fighting for universal healthcare since 1993](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_health_care_plan_of_1993) and never once proposed Single Payer. Lots of people seem to think that “Single Payer” is synonymous with Universal Healthcare, or that it’s the only way to achieve it, and that’s [simply not true](http://www.forbes.com/sites/danmunro/2013/12/08/universal-coverage-is-not-single-payer-healthcare/#60a15fc47f5d).

* **NAFTA**: It’s almost as if she has a mixed opinion of NAFTA, and nuanced opinions on free trade in general. It seems to me that she believes in free trade agreements in principle, if not always in the way they’re implemented, and learned from NAFTA the importance of adding protections for American jobs. So yes, as First Lady, she spoke favorably of NAFTA, though by 1998 she was already [publicly expressing concerns about it](http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/04/21/401123124/a-timeline-of-hillary-clintons-evolution-on-trade): “I would add that there does need to be sensitivity to worker and environmental concerns in trade agreements going forward in the future.” According to [Politifact](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/25/barack-obama/clinton-has-changed-on-nafta/), “We should note that Clinton biographer Sally Bedell Smith has said that as first lady, Clinton opposed NAFTA privately but supported it publicly because it was important to her husband politically.” Many of the clips and quotes included in the video also often have her expressing some concern about it, though of course those parts are cut out. In 2000, she said, “What happened to NAFTA, I think, was we inherited an agreement that we didn't get everything we should have got out of it in my opinion. I think the NAFTA agreement was flawed. The problem is we have to go back and figure out how we are going to fix that.” Then the video takes the following 2004 quote out of context: “I think on balance NAFTA has been good for New York and America, but I also think that there are a number of areas where we're not dealt with in an upfront way in dealing with our friend to the north, Canada, which seems to be able to come up with a number of rationales for keeping New York agricultural products out of Canada.” Then in 2007, “I believe in the general principles it represented, but what we have learned is that we have to drive a tougher bargain. Our market is the market that everybody wants to be in. We should quit giving it away so willy-nilly. I believe we need tougher enforcement of the trade agreements we already have. You look at the trade enforcement record between the Clinton Administration and the Bush Administration, the Clinton Administration brought more trade enforcement actions in one year than the Bush Administration brought in six years. For me, trade is who we are. We're traders. We want to be involved in the global economy, but not be played for suckers… Look, NAFTA did not do what many had hoped, and so we do need to take a look at it and we do need to figure out how we're going to have trade relations that are smart, that give the American worker and the American consumer rights around the world.” And most recently with the TPP, yes she supported it in principle, but once the language was actually finalized, she felt that it [fell short](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-singh-grewal/why-hillary-clinton-is-ri_b_8295420.html). “It was just finally negotiated last week, and in looking at it, it didn't meet my standards. My standards for more new, good jobs for Americans, for raising wages for Americans. And I want to make sure that I can look into the eyes of any middle-class American and say, ‘this will help raise your wages.’ And I concluded I could not.” [source](http://www.ontheissues.org/2016/Hillary_Clinton_Free_Trade.htm)

Large financial firms would need to demonstrate to regulators that they can be managed effectively, with appropriate accountability across all of their activities. If firms can’t be managed effectively, regulators would have the explicit statutory authorization to require that they reorganize, downsize, or break apart. And Clinton would appoint regulators who would use both these new authorities and the substantial authorities they already have to hold firms accountable."" -[Hillary Clinton's website](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2015/10/08/wall-street-work-for-main-street/)

* ""Well, I have been a strong supporter of Dodd-Frank because it is the most consequential financial reforms since the Great Depression. And I have said many times in debates and in other settings, there is authority in Dodd-Frank to break up banks that pose a grave threat to financial stability. There are two approaches. There's Section 121, Section 165, and both of them can be used by regulators to either require a bank to sell off businesses, lines of businesses or assets, because of the finding that is made by two-thirds of the financial regulators that the institution poses a grave threat, or if the Fed and the FDIC conclude that the institutions' living will resolution is inadequate and is not going to get any better, there can also be requirements that they do so. So we've got that structure. Now a lot of people have argued that there need to be some tweaks to it that I would be certainly open to. But my point from the very beginning of this campaign, and it's something that I've said repeatedly: big banks did not cause the Great Recession primarily. They were complicit, but hedge funds; Lehman Brothers, an investment bank; a big insurance company, AIG; mortgage companies like Countrywide, Fannie and Freddie — there were lots of culprits who were contributing to the circumstances that led to the very dangerous financial crisis."" -[Hillary Clinton, New York Daily News interview](http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/transcript-hillary-clinton-meets-news-editorial-board-article-1.2596292)

257,"I love what Sanders has done to promote liberal causes and bring the national discussion more to the left. I love that he has engaged many young or previously disenchanted voters. It encourages me that the country does seem to be moving in a more liberal direction.

&gt; Many just view both parties are absolute shit and wouldn't want to vote for either.

And this brings us back to the initial point. Arguing that Obama isn't progressive enough is one of the factors that kept many liberal voters home in 2010, losing Democrats the House and the supermajority in the Senate. This only ensured that many of Obama's progressive goals would be stalled or halted completely thereafter.

&gt; Trump is an idiot, but politics as usual only ensures many, many more chances for people worse than Trump to get elected in the future. Change is necessary, Clinton is not change.

This argument is insane to me. I do not believe in political arson. Saying that voting for Trump, or even just not voting for Clinton in November, means that progressive causes will win out in the long run is, in my opinion, irresponsible and dangerous. And anyone who was voting for Bernie Sanders because of his stance on progressive issues would see that Clinton is much closer to Sanders than Trump or any of the other Republican candidates (just ask [Sanders](http://www.mediaite.com/tv/bernie-sanders-makes-nice-on-her-worst-day-hillary-is-100-times-better-than-any-republican/)).

I would, in fact, argue the opposite of what you're suggesting. Carter the man is very progressive but was a largely ineffectual president, and the response to that was the Reagan era that you keep pointing out. Before that, George McGovern, a very liberal Democratic candidate, was trounced in 1972. And that's not even getting into Mondale, Dukakis, and the effects of Nader in 2000.

My point is, I think that this litmus test that politicians must be ""true progressives"" and must never compromise with anyone is much more damaging to the actual opportunity to effect real progressive change in this country, than Obama not quite getting everything he wanted done. And so I think spreading this false information that Obama isn't progressive (or that [Hillary Clinton isn't](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/hillary-clinton-was-liberal-hillary-clinton-is-liberal/)) is actually damaging to progressive causes.",2016-05-15 20:38:55+00:00,d36ow6i,14.0,t1_d36m8xe,4337.0,politics

And while many in this sub like to call Hillary supporters ""low information voters,"" it was 15% of Sanders voters who said they either did not vote or did not know who they voted for in the Wisconsin Supreme Court election. The liberal judge, Kloppenburg, narrowly lost the race.

The fact that Clinton has received [about 56%](http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P16/D) of the vote from the primary season and well over a million more votes than anyone else running, whereas Sanders received around 42% and Trump received [about 40% on the Republican side](http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P16/R) means that *she's* the weak candidate?

&gt; The other half is becoming more disdainful of her every day. About another 30% of the electorate is Republican. They absolutely hate her - possibly more so than Obama.

&gt; That leaves the remaining 40% that is independent. Historically, independents have been tepid towards her, at best. Wary of her, is probably a better description.

Trump polls [very poorly among independents](http://www.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/188177/trump-image-among-democrats-independents-negative-gop-candidate.aspx). In fact, he polls very poorly in every category that isn't white men: [women](http://www.gallup.com/poll/190403/seven-women-unfavorable-opinion-trump.aspx) (where 46% of *Republican* women hold an unfavorable view of him, and 73% of women overall), [young voters](http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/25/politics/donald-trump-young-voters/) (75% unfavorable), [educated voters](http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/peter-fenn/articles/2016-03-21/trump-has-deep-demographic-problems-come-the-2016-general-election), [black voters](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-trump-non-white-voters-20160311-story.html) (86% unfavorable), and [hispanic voters](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-trump-non-white-voters-20160311-story.html) (77% unfavorable).

EDIT: And that's not to mention:

&gt; Moreover, Trump’s claim that he built a real-estate fortune out of a “small” $1 million loan is simply not credible. He benefited from numerous loans and loan guarantees, as well as his father’s connections, to make the move into Manhattan. His father also set up lucrative trusts to provide steady income. When Donald Trump became overextended in the casino business, his father bailed him out with a shady casino-chip loan—and Trump also borrowed $9 million against his future inheritance.

That's hardly an impressive opener.

In 2009, Sanders [voted in favor the ""Brownback Amendment""](http://library.cqpress.com/cqalmanac/file.php?path=Floor%20Votes%20Tables/2009_Senate_Floor_Votes_230-233.pdf) which added an anti-gay religious liberty exemption to the [Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Shepard_and_James_Byrd_Jr._Hate_Crimes_Prevention_Act#Senate).

Certainly, DOMA was bad.

&gt; In the twenty years since DOMA, Hillary Clinton has not only evolved on the issue, she has become a global leader in the fight for LGBT equality. As senator from New York, she pushed to repeal the ban on gays in the military and secure employment protections for LGBT Americans. As secretary of state she extended her view of human and women’s rights with a groundbreaking speech at the United Nations in 2011 declaring that “gay rights are human rights” and made the protection of gays, lesbians and transgender people a priority in her dealings with repressive regimes around the world. Perhaps most importantly, she engaged with the community – closely – for the last 25 years. Listening, learning, sometimes disagreeing but always striving and evolving and always caring.

&gt; Bernie Sanders has done none of the above. Despite being from Vermont, a state with a progressive record on LGBT rights, Sanders was a follower. He supported [civil unions as a solution for as long as many leading Democrats](http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2015/10/05/bernie_sanders_on_marriage_equality_he_s_no_longtime_champion.html).

I think it's great that he spoke out against a constitutional amendment specifying marriage between a man and a woman, though so did Hillary Clinton and many others.

But in 2006, when Bernie Sanders was running for the first time for the Senate, he dodged the question of his position on same sex marriage at every turn. Peter Freyne, a locally beloved Vermont writer and opinion writer whom Sanders later lauded as “the best political reporter in the state of Vermont,” accused the then-Congressman of obfuscating on his gay rights position.

“Obtaining Congressman Bernie Sanders’ position on the gay marriage issue was like pulling teeth … from a rhinoceros,” Freyne wrote. Freyne described repeated attempts to hear Sanders’ views on gay marriage, and the congressman only said he “supports the current process” in the state legislature. Though Sanders was not in the Vermont state legislature at the time, it was a hot topic in his home state at the time.

“It’s an election year, yet despite the lack of a serious challenger, The Bern’s gut-level paranoia is acting up,” Freyne wrote. [-TIME Magazine](http://time.com/4089946/bernie-sanders-gay-marriage/)

The fact of the matter is, Bernie Sanders did not come out in support of gay marriage while campaigning for the Senate in 2006, despite having many opportunities to do so.

False. Any statements he made about San Bernardino or Farook's family would have been days later. And completely unrelated to the point he was making about ""taking out"" the families of ISIS terrorists in Syria.

You linked to him talking about the family of the San Bernardino shooters. But that's *not where the quote comes from*. It comes from when he was on Fox and Friends talking specifically about ISIS in Syria. He says nothing whatsoever about ""guilty"" family members. He says it in regards to avoiding **civilian** casualties when going after terrorists in Syria. His response:

&gt; Brian Kilmeade: ""What about civilian casualties? What about the fact that we're targeting them and people are very concerned about collateral damage?""

&gt; Donald Trump: ""I would do my best, absolute best — I mean, one of the problems we have or one of the reasons we're so ineffective is, you know, they're trying to, they're using them as shields. It's a horrible thing. They're using them as shields. But we're fighting a very politically correct war. And the other thing is with the terrorists, you have to take out their families. When you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives, don't kid yourself. But they say they don't care about their lives.

Yet the only evidence you provide is his support for civil unions... Something that Hillary Clinton supported [since at least 1999](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/03/18/how-hillary-clinton-evolved-on-gay-marriage).

&gt; When asked if he would push for gay marriage right then and there he pretty much said ""No, we just won a major battle for gay rights, and the the political climate is far too unstable to go for anything further at the moment.""

[In 2006], Peter Freyne, a locally beloved Vermont writer and opinion writer whom Sanders later lauded as “the best political reporter in the state of Vermont,” accused the then-Congressman of obfuscating on his gay rights position.

“Obtaining Congressman Bernie Sanders’ position on the gay marriage issue was like pulling teeth … from a rhinoceros,” Freyne wrote. Freyne described repeated attempts to hear Sanders’ views on gay marriage, and the congressman only said he “supports the current process” in the state legislature. Though Sanders was not in the Vermont state legislature at the time, it was a hot topic in his home state at the time.

“It’s an election year, yet despite the lack of a serious challenger, The Bern’s gut-level paranoia is acting up,” Freyne wrote. [-TIME Magazine](http://time.com/4089946/bernie-sanders-gay-marriage/)

&gt; Three years later, he helped get Gay marriage passed.

Bernie Sanders was in the Vermont state legislature? At the same time he was in the U.S. Senate? I didn't think that was possible!

&gt; So please do not repeat the ""Bernie didn't support Gay Marriage until 2009"" because it's not true, at all. Saying ""let's collect our strength and bide our time"" is not the same as ""No, I don't want this.""

Not saying ""I don't want this"" *is not the same as supporting something*. Waiting until after something is already legal and polling well in your own state to express support is exactly the type of politicking this sub typically decries. Bernie Sanders has a strong record on gay rights, so I'm not sure why people feel the need to distort his record.

Arguments for that he's bad can include a lot of things, and really depends on your political position.""), even if I disagree on several things on your pros and cons list (I'm sure everyone's would be different). Here were a few things that stuck out for me:

&gt; And then when gay marriage became legal of course he's immediately in support of it, to the point of having the white house turned rainbow colors.

This is misremembering recent history a bit. Obama expressed support for same sex marriage in May of 2012, when it was only legal in a handful of states (and outright banned in about 40 others), and a full *three years* before Obergefell v. Hodges made it the law of the land. The political tide was certainly moving in that direction, but I hardly think it's accurate to say he supported it only after it had become legal. And his remarks came in a divisive election year, no less; you'd think someone who was waiting until it was politically expedient would have waited to show support until after that campaign season ended.

&gt; We could talk about crumbling infrastructure in our country, how investing in it could provide jobs for a lot of the blue collar people of our country who now are turning to politicians like Trump because they don't think their concerns are being met. It could have helped out areas with high unemployment, helped out places like ghettos where better investments could have lead to companies moving there and creating jobs.

[The Recovery Act](https://www.transportation.gov/fastlane/recovery-act-still-paying-dividends) was one of the largest investments in infrastructure in recent memory. And despite also including one of the [largest tax cuts in U.S. history](http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/robert-schlesinger/2009/02/12/is-obama-stimulus-plan-also-the-biggest-tax-cut-ever), only three Republican senators voted for it.

Just last December, Obama signed a 5-year, $305 billion [infrastructure spending bill](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/f1b2c8dee7ea45b2a91b2d306b180429/congress-approves-bill-boost-nations-infrastructure), though he has called for far more than that. Previously, Congress had continually only passed [three-month stopgap measures](http://abcnewsradioonline.com/politics-news/obama-congress-needs-to-stop-funding-transportation-by-the-s.html) for transportation. ""We can't keep on funding transportation by the seat of our pants,"" Obama said last July.

And then I'm not sure how we can talk about this:

&gt; Thing is, presidents like Clinton reached across the party line to get things through. Obama's Affordable Care Act was pushed through congress in the very brief period when the dems had an overwhelming super majority, and shortly after Obama mocked those who were opposed to it.

Without talking about this:

&gt; Last, I will give Obama that he has been unfairly obstructed during his presidency. Republican elected officials have, in my eyes, turned against the people of the country in the name of (in my mind) identity politics.

When the opposition leader in the Senate says, ""The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president,"" it's hard to argue they're working in good faith. Certainly there is ugly partisanship on both sides, but the degree of obstruction in this Congress is next to unprecedented. They've been one of the [least productive Congresses in modern history](http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/113th-congress-not-least-productive-modern-history-n276216).

And to the ACA specifically. I followed its path through Congress very closely in 2009-2010. First, there's the fact that Obama started with the basis of what had essentially been the right's approach to healthcare reform for decades (from [Nixon's plan](https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2012/06/22/stockman/bvg57mguQxOVpZMmB1Mg2N/story.html) in the 70s, to the [Heritage Foundation plan](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/15/health/policy/health-care-mandate-was-first-backed-by-conservatives.html?_r=0) in the 80s, to the [Republican Congress' alternative plan](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/15/ellen-qualls/aca-gop-health-care-plan-1993/) in the 90s, to [RomneyCare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_health_care_reform) in the 00s). There were differences of course, but ""socialized medicine"" and ""death panels"" the ACA was not.

Secondly, Obama went out of his way to encourage Republican participation at several critical junctures in the bill's journey, including [holding a bipartisan healthcare summit with Congress](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/07/AR2010020703003.html) in February 2010 to try to get more input from Republicans. The Democrats had a supermajority, he did not have to do this if his sole intent was to just ram it through Congress unilaterally. The fact that not a single Republican voted for the ACA speak more to the intransigence among Republicans in Congress than it does about a lack of effort for bipartisanship. It's 6 years later, and after countless efforts at ""repeal and replace,"" Republicans have yet to actually outline any serious plan to replace Obamacare, let alone one that wouldn't strip healthcare from millions of Americans.",2016-04-15 19:02:07+00:00,d24cjvb,2.0,t1_d23lscw,53620.0,PoliticalDiscussion

362,"Obviously the pledged delegate count is what matters at the end of the day, but I think it's of note who the majority of people that have taken part in the (big D) Democratic primary process have voted for. Especially when that same candidate has also won the most states and the most delegates. I guess you don't, which is fine. But while yes, the primaries are not direct democracy, the popular vote does impact the pledged delegate numbers, and those in turn (in a rather different way) impact the superdelegate numbers.*

&gt; But that STILL doesn't count the fact that more people would have voted if every state was an open primary (no closed primaries or caucuses which have lower turnout), more people would have voted if every state had registration available all the way up to the actual election days, more people would have voted if the campaigns spread their resources to attract all voters and not just Democrats.

Let's take that even further and say that it's not true democracy unless we have mandatory voting! Everyone's voice must be heard!

Open primaries have issues of their own and are subject to [manipulation and dilution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_primaries_in_the_United_States#Manipulation_and_dilution). That aside, [Clinton has won 13/18 open primaries thus far](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_primaries_in_the_United_States#States_with_open_primaries_for_other_elections).

&gt; We'll never know because it's a pointless hypothetical situation which is what that counter argument is based on.

The counter argument is based on the actual people that have participated in the Democratic primary process thus far, not on a hypothetical situation.

&gt; Super delegates are simply not democratic

*Of course they're not – though they have yet to ever go against the will of the people (not to say it wouldn't happen). /u/DefaultProphet had [a great succinct description](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4e7m0b/growing_backlash_demands_superdelegates_vote/d1y558t) of the purpose of superdelegates: 

""To get the pledged delegate leader over the line so we don't end up with a convention fight that weakens the ticket. Alternatively to be able to break the glass on the 'never voted against the will of the people' safety valve in case Trump happens.""

I'm personally not a fan of superdelegates myself because they are so undemocratic (though I bet the RNC wishes they had them right about now). I'm also not a fan of caucuses, which I believe are undemocratic in a different way (time restrictions, lack of anonymity, etc.) If I had a say in the matter, I'd get rid of both superdelegates and caucuses.

&gt; And if Sanders is somehow able to pull ahead with the majority of the pledged delegates but Hillary wins anyway with super delegates, it will be ""undemocratic"" because that's how the Democratic Party designed it.

Correct. And if Sanders loses the pledged delegates but somehow manages to convince the superdelegates to vote for him anyway, [as he himself has suggested](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/sanders-surprises-controversial-superdelegate-strategy), then that would also be undemocratic.

I mean, in the strictest sense, it doesn't. The only thing that matters is total number of delegates.

It's a counterargument to the narrative that Clinton is winning undemocratically because of superdelegates. Even if we take all of the superdelegates out of the equation, Clinton still has the most raw votes (yes, even when taking caucuses into account), the most states, and the most pledged delegates. She's winning by basically every metric, so I'm not sure why people are making the argument that the superdelegates are winning the election for her. If Bernie Sanders were to win the most pledged delegates in the primary, the superdelegates would in all likelihood flock to him, just like they did with Obama in 2008.",2016-04-11 23:35:25+00:00,d1z4jrx,7.0,t1_d1z3djl,1824.0,politics

“Even though the resolution before the Senate is not as strong as I would like in requiring the diplomatic route first … I take the president at his word that he will try hard to pass a United Nations resolution and seek to avoid war, if possible. Because bipartisan support for this resolution makes success in the United Nations more likely and war less likely—and because a good faith effort by the United States, even if it fails, will bring more allies and legitimacy to our cause—I have concluded, after careful and serious consideration, that a vote for the resolution best serves the security of our nation. If we were to defeat this resolution or pass it with only a few Democrats, I am concerned that those who want to pretend this problem will go away with delay will oppose any United Nations resolution calling for unrestricted inspections.”

“This is a difficult vote. This is probably the hardest decision I have ever had to make. Any vote that may lead to war should be hard, but I cast it with conviction. … My vote is not, however, a vote for any new doctrine of preemption or for unilateralism or for the arrogance of American power or purpose.” A vote for the resolution, she argued, “is not a vote to rush to war; it is a vote that puts awesome responsibility in the hands of our president.

388,"In regards to the DNC stuff, there may be actual concrete differences in the treatment of the two campaigns (though I'm not sure I've seen solid evidence of it). I suppose I'm a bit skeptical that even if it exists that it's as widespread as is claimed or actually having that much of an effect on either campaign.

I guess I'm put off by the many times this primary season Sanders supporters have ""cried wolf.""  Somehow virtually every Clinton win outside of the South has been challenged in one way or another. First, there were the barrage of stories saying that Clinton won Iowa because of coin tosses, which is [completely false](http://www.npr.org/2016/02/02/465268206/coin-toss-fact-check-no-coin-flips-did-not-win-iowa-for-hillary-clinton) (by the way, I have friends on Facebook that still believe this to be true despite any evidence I've provided to the contrary). Then there was Bill Clinton's ""illegal"" antics in Massachusetts singlehandedly winning her the state; while his actions were dumb and questionable, he didn't break any election laws according to [MA's own state officials](http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/blog/2016/03/04/bill-clinton-massachusetts-election-law/), and he certainly didn't dramatically alter the results of the state. And then there was perhaps the single dumbest accusation of the whole race: that Hillary Clinton's campaign staff [weren't allowed to wear the color red](http://www.forwardprogressives.com/no-hillary-clintons-campaign-was-not-caught-trying-to-impersonate-nurses-union-members/). And then the most recent one was a post on the front page literally claiming [Hillary Clinton ""cheated""](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4bmzch/hillary_cheating_scandal_erupts_in_arizona/) by somehow being responsible for the Republican Arizona government's elections (in which the [too-few polling places](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/03/22/arizona-primary-turnout-trump-cruz-kasich-clinton-sanders/82134252/), in all likelihood, cost both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton votes).

I'm all for calling out legitimate voter suppression issues (like in Arizona), yet there has been nary a peep on Reddit about [caucus irregularities in Idaho](http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2016/03/23/3762340/az-ut-id-voting-problems/) or [voter ID-caused problems in Wisconsin](http://www.thenation.com/article/wisconsins-voter-id-law-caused-major-problems-at-the-polls-last-night/). I personally find caucuses to be extremely outdated, and due to the time restrictions and lack of anonymity, very undemocratic. I think they should all be replaced by primaries. And Reddit seemed to agree with me after Iowa and Nevada, but not so much after Minnesota, Nebraska, Colorado, Alaska, Idaho, Kansas, Washington, etc...

Granted this is some vocal Sanders' supporters turning /r/politics into /r/conspiracy, but I have seen hints of this playing-the-victim attitude coming from the Sanders campaign itself, like [dismissing Planned Parenthood as part of the ""establishment""](http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2016/01/20/bernie_sanders_says_planned_parenthood_is_establishment_is_it.html), as well as in other cases.

Also, looking beyond the DNC itself to Democrats in Congress. Why is it that even after being in the Senate for 9 years, not a single current senator has endorsed Sanders? And after having served in the House for 16 years, he only has [seven representatives that have endorsed him](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bernie_Sanders_presidential_campaign_endorsements,_2016#U.S._Senators). (This compares to 40 current senators and 166 representatives that have endorsed Clinton). You would think these are the people who have worked with him and know him best. Now, it could be because of a conspiracy by the DNC, or it could be because these people legitimately believe Clinton to be the better candidate. As Barney Frank, the very progressive former representative that, at least on paper, seemingly should get along quite well with Sanders, [said in 1991](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/08/bernie-sanders-2016-democrats-121181_Page2.html#.VwlZQmNzQbA): ""Bernie alienates his natural allies. His holier-than-thou attitude—saying in a very loud voice he is smarter than everyone else and purer than everyone else—really undercuts his effectiveness.""

The last point I'll make is that much of Sanders' very ambitious agenda hinges on Democrats (and *very liberal* ones at that) taking back control of the Senate **and** the House, as he himself has alluded to repeatedly with his talk of a revolution. But he has done very little this 2016 campaign season to raise any money for (or even raise awareness of) key Democratic candidates. The best Sanders could muster when asked about raising money for down-ticket races was [""we'll see.""](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/sanders-on-democratic-fundraising-we-ll-see-655536195876) Clinton, on the other hand, [has raised a considerable amount for down-ticket races](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/clinton-sanders-differ-down-ballot-democrats). And I believe evidence of Sanders' lack of campaigning for other Democrats was borne out when you look at the race for the Wisconsin Supreme Court:

""Something interesting from the exit polls: Many Sanders voters answered ""did not know"" who they voted for in the Supreme Court or did not vote for Kloppenburg. 15% of Sanders supporters did this. Only 4% of Clinton supporters fell in this category.""

""We project Bradley will win by VERY narrow margins. If the 15% of Sanders supporters who did not vote in the supreme court race or voted for Bradley would have voted identical to Clinton supporters (4% voted for Bradley or didn't vote or didn't know who they voted for),  Kloppenburg would have won.""

&gt; I find her general lack of consistency concerning.

I already addressed gay marriage in my OP, so I’ll touch on some of your other points:

* TPP/free trade

What some might see as lack of consistency I think can oftentimes be chalked up to nuance. Outside of Reddit, [most economists agree](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/26/upshot/economists-actually-agree-on-this-point-the-wisdom-of-free-trade.html) that free trade deals overall are generally a net positive. As I [outlined in another comment about her stance on NAFTA](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4bs2tl/the_bernie_or_bust_movement_is_not_based_on/d1d83ih), it appears to me that she favors free trade agreements in general, but wants them to include protections for workers in the U.S. (I think this is a lesson she learned from NAFTA). When the final language of TPP came out, it didn't meet her standards, so she no longer supported it.

* Glass-Steagall

Was repealing it a mistake? Yes. Did its repeal cause the financial crisis? I’m not so sure about that. Sources:

[The Week](http://theweek.com/articles/583243/what-hillary-gets-right-about-glasssteagall)

[Associated Press](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/d46a75ec8e474ab5bd7bce1b8aaf0402/ap-fact-check-sanders-1-percent-clinton-health-law): “Many economists note that nearly all the large financial institutions that failed in the crisis, including Lehman Brothers, AIG, and Bear Stearns, were investment banks or insurance companies, and their failure wouldn't have been prevented if Glass-Steagall had still been in effect.”

[Paul Krugman](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/16/opinion/democrats-republicans-and-wall-street-tycoons.html): “Mr. Sanders has been focused on restoring Glass-Steagall, the rule that separated deposit-taking banks from riskier wheeling and dealing. And repealing Glass-Steagall was indeed a mistake. But it’s not what caused the financial crisis, which arose instead from ‘shadow banks’ like Lehman  Brothers, which don’t take deposits but can nonetheless wreak havoc when they fail. Mrs. Clinton has laid out a plan to rein in shadow banks; so far, Mr. Sanders hasn’t.”

[Barney Frank](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/hillary-clinton-barney-frank-wall-street-dodd-214532#ixzz3nvG11SSr): “The Glass-Steagall debate is an artificial debate at this point. It’s 85 years old. Most people can see if we had it in effect, it wouldn’t have stopped AIG. It wouldn’t stop subprime mortgages that shouldn’t have been granted.”

[Politico’s Michael Grunwald](https://twitter.com/MikeGrunwald/status/678407327549100032): “I will repeat: Glass-Steagall had nothing to do with Bear, Lehman, Merrill, Fannie, Freddie, Countrywide, AIG, WaMu, etc.”

[Bloomberg’s Paula Dwyer](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-10-14/clinton-is-right-glass-steagall-is-debate-democrats-don-t-need): “True, repealing Glass-Steagall enabled banks to deal in such risky instruments, but keeping the law would not have averted the crisis.”

[Roosevelt Institute’s Mike Konczal](http://www.vox.com/2015/10/8/9482521/hillary-clinton-financial-reform): “The continued focus on Glass-Steagall hangs oddly over the debate, since the primary housing and financial crisis occurred outside the traditional commercial banking sector, and future worries are as likely to be in opaque corners of the financial markets.”

[Mother Jones’ Kevin Drum](http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2015/10/hillary-clinton-wants-cut-mega-banks-down-size): “Bring back Glass-Steagall! This is a popular cry . . . but it's probably not a very good idea on the merits. Glass-Steagall is a New Deal law that split up commercial banks and investment banks, and it was repealed in 1999. Ten years later Wall Street went up in smoke. But commercial banks and investment banks both had problems, and so did combined banks. The repeal of Glass-Steagall really had nothing to do with it.”

As I mentioned in my OP, Hillary Clinton’s Wall Street plan, which would look to regulate more of the areas of the economy that Glass-Steagall never did, has received praise from many economists, and many others on the left including [Elizabeth Warren](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/12/07/elizabeth-warren-praises-hillary-clintons-wall-street-plan/). And I wrote more about Hillary Clinton’s record on Wall Street in 2007/2008 [in another post](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/49fm9q/march_7_2016_fox_news_democratic_posttown_hall/d0rslxy).

Furthermore, has Sanders made votes that he later regretted? [I would imagine so](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/fact-checking-hillary-clinton-on-bernie-sanders-financial-votes/).

&gt; Second and almost as important, I feel as if your response on her federal investigations is a tad lacking

Not sure what you want me to say here. I'm no expert on government classification. I admitted that there’s a lot about it that I (and all of us outside of the State Dept., the FBI, and the DOJ) don’t know. Were any of the emails that were retroactively classified sent by Clinton, or merely received by her? How many of these emails are the result of over-classification as [Secretary Powell](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/fbi-colin-powell-email-probe-218748) has called it? As Powell said about the emails from his own private AOL (!) account that have since been classified:

“They’re fairly innocuous and very benign and neither ambassador classified them at the time. They were merely information memos sent to State.gov. My executive assistants thought they should send them to me on my personal email. I found that personally acceptable. That's why I bought all those computers in the first place. Now, 11 or 12 years later, as part of a whole process of reviewing things somebody in the department says, 'Well, they're classified.' My response to that is no they were not. You can say your judgment is they should have been classified but at the time they were not classified.”

I believe that we know that none of the emails were marked classified at the time. We also know that apparently even mentioning – or linking to a news article on – the CIA’s technically top secret, but publicly very well known, drone program qualifies as [Top Secret/SAP](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/officials-new-top-secret-clinton-emails-innocuous-n500586), the government's *highest level of classification*. We also know that the only two other previous Secretaries of State to ever use email [definitively handled classified information on private email](http://mediamatters.org/blog/2016/03/07/state-dept-concludes-past-secretaries-of-state/209044). We also know that even the state.gov servers that much of this now-considered-classified information was likely sent *from* are not supposed to transmit classified information either. There are other channels for transmitting classified information.

“Clinton has said she viewed classified information in hard copy in her office. If she was traveling, she used other secure channels. ‘The fact that no emails on her personal server were marked as classified suggests that she generally was doing her classified business on the secure government servers dedicated to that purpose,’ said Liza Goitein, co-director of the Brennan Center for Justice’s Liberty and National Security Program.” [source](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/sep/10/hillary-clintons-emails-classified-or-not/)

But I’m not sure that any of this information is satisfying to you. Which is why I said in my OP that I’m just going to defer to the FBI and DOJ on the matter.

&gt; as evidenced by the poll data fiasco

What would your reaction be if someone from Clinton’s campaign had been caught doing what Sander’s staffers did? What would r/politics’ reaction in general have been? I’m honestly curious.

392,"&gt; Do you worry if Hillary gets the nomination but the FBI moves forward that it will seriously hurt her chances?

I mean, if the DOJ *were* to actually indict her, of course that would basically end her campaign. I’m not convinced that that will happen though, reading from [many](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-hillary-clinton-is-unlikely-to-be-indicted-over-her-private-email-server/2016/03/08/341c3786-e557-11e5-b0fd-073d5930a7b7_story.html) expert’s [analyses](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/5d178ec5685d43d38efe0dc600a81dcd/experts-clinton-unlikely-face-felony-charges-over-emails) on the topic (that aren’t from Breitbart, Daily Caller, Russian propaganda sites, et.al.). It just doesn’t seem likely. And President Obama, who I imagine knows more about the inner-workings of this situation than your average Redditor, has signaled support for her; if he knew she were heading toward an indictment, I believe he would be distancing himself from her (and possibly would have urged Biden to jump in earlier). My guess (and this is just a guess, as that’s all anyone on Reddit can make about this) is that like the many trumped up accusations thrown Hillary’s way, this one will soon come up essentially empty (and I’d imagine the FBI is hoping to wrap up their investigation sooner than later for everyone’s sake).

Now, on to your questions about Trump and Hillary's electability:

People like to point to general election matchup polls that show Sanders beating Trump more than Clinton does (though I believe she always beats him, too). These are [meaningless at this stage](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/harrys-guide-to-2016-election-polls/). If they were accurate, then [President Romney would be currently finishing up his first term](http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/213441-poll-romney-bests-obama-falls-to-clinton).

The fact is Donald Trump is [unpopular with general election voters](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/donald-trump-is-really-unpopular-with-general-election-voters/). Like, [really unpopular](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/trumps-popularity-nosedives-in-critical-stretch-221320). And sure, Hillary Clinton’s unfavorables are higher than the (never-the-subject-of-a-Republican-attack-blitz) Senator Sanders’ are, but they’re still better than Trump’s (her net negative is [-21, his is -33](http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/22/politics/2016-election-poll-donald-trump-hillary-clinton/)). I also think it’s much more difficult to “swift boat” someone whose dirty laundry has been airing out in public for 25 years (see: scandal fatigue). Meanwhile, the [Republicans](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-01-19/republican-operatives-are-trying-to-help-bernie-sanders) and [conservative media](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/14/bernie-sanders-republican-operatives-hillary-clinton) have actually been [running ads](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/01/21/republicans-promoting-bernie-sanders-candidacy-embarrass-hillary-clinton/79088912/) to [help Sanders](http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-01-26/republicans-run-ad-against-sanders-because-they-want-him-to-win), and it’s not because they think he’s going to be tougher to beat.

In the Republican primary thus far, Trump has won on average [just 37% of the vote](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2016/03/22/donald_trump_has_37_percent_hard_to_get_to_270_electoral_votes_130052.html). A plurality of a plurality. That was fine in a crowded field, but it’s not doing so well for him in the virtual one-on-one battle he’s in now. Meanwhile, [Hillary Clinton has won over 56% of the popular vote](http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P16/D) on the Democratic side thus far. She’s also the only candidate on either side who has received more votes than Trump. Perhaps more importantly, Hillary Clinton has [won 5/7 of swing states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state#Swing_states_for_the_2016_Election) in the Democratic primary.

Bernie or Bust movement aside, Democrats are generally happy with both of their options. [78% said they’d be satisfied with Clinton, 63% said they’d be happy with Sanders](http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/presidential-campaign/272381-the-truth-about-primary-voter-turnout). And the percentage of Sanders supporters who have said they would never vote for Hillary is far lower [than the 54% of Clinton-supporting PUMAs in 2008](http://www.vox.com/2016/3/28/11319720/bernie-or-bust-sanders) that claimed they would never vote for Obama (and we all know how that turned out).

&gt; Trump will move more centrist, and I think he can support that to some degree based on past statements etc.

Trump has had ample opportunity to try to expand his support base, but he's instead actually doubled down on a lot of his divisive rhetoric thus far. He may try to move more to the center in the general, but his rhetoric in the primary has gotten him a lot of attention that may be difficult to undo. 50% of **Republican** women [dislike Trump](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/judith-barnett/republican-women-may-lead-hillary_b_8926666.html); [73% of women overall](http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/31/politics/donald-trump-women-poll-numbers/) have a negative view of him. And [recent actions](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/31/us/politics/donald-trump-abortion.html?_r=0) by [Trump](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/03/24/trump-flack-s-defense-of-sexist-heidi-cruz-attack-stuns-cnn.html) have likely only hurt his numbers with women. Need I point out that [women make up the majority of voters](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-20231337) in this country?

[8 in 10 Hispanic voters](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2016/02/25/poll-trumps-negatives-among-hispanics-rise-worst-in-gop-field/) view Trump unfavorably (and 7 in 10 of that is “very unfavorable”). [86% of black voters](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-trump-non-white-voters-20160311-story.html) view him unfavorably. If he won with white men as much as Romney did (and I’m not sure he would), he could still easily lose to Clinton, as [Romney did to Obama](http://www.thenation.com/article/bad-news-about-white-people-romney-won-white-vote-almost-everywhere/).

Of course it is. This is completely ignoring my post, and completely ignoring the actual history of the [DADT battle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_ask,_don%27t_tell#Origin), in which Bill Clinton campaigned on outright lifting the ban on gays in the military and took a huge political hit for trying to do so. But that's fine.

Hey, you're free to support the candidates you choose for the reasons you do. As I said before, Bernie Sanders has a good record on LGBT issues.

398,"I think while the photo of him ""right behind her"" makes for an amusing headline, the reality of 1993-4 was not so simple. This article does a great job of laying it out: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/clinton-sanders-health-reform_us_56e715c9e4b065e2e3d6e14f

&gt; But his presence at that speech — like a gracious letter Clinton sent him in 1993 — isn’t proof that Sanders was a major ally of the Clinton health care effort. Sanders wasn’t even endorsing the Clinton plan, unlike another member of Congress who attended the rally.

&gt; In fact, Sanders opposed the proposal throughout the process, his campaign confirmed to The Huffington Post. As late as August 1994, while Democrats were making a last-ditch effort to pass Clinton’s plan, Sanders held a press conference opposing it — and touting single-payer, according to his campaign.

He didn't cause the plan to fail, but he didn't help it all that much. And I think this is a perfect example of the difference between Sanders' and Clinton's approaches. He fights for his own ideal (single payer), while she tries to do what she can to actually get something passed, even if it falls a bit short of her goal.

Presidents since at least Teddy Roosevelt (and including FDR, Truman, Johnson, Nixon, and Clinton) have been pushing for healthcare reform. (In fact, one of the late [Senator Ted Kennedy's biggest regrets as a legislator](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/27/AR2009082703919.html) was not cutting a deal with Nixon to achieve healthcare reform because the compromise didn't live up to his standards). Obama actually achieved it. It isn't perfect, and there's much room for improvement (a public option would be a great start), but it's miles better than what we had before. Personally, I don't believe we should let the perfect be the enemy of the good.

So yes, Sanders was involved to a *degree* in Hillary Clinton's efforts for healthcare reform in the 1990s, but certainly not on the front lines of it, and for much of it *opposing* her actual effort.",2016-04-07 18:31:18+00:00,d1tve2i,,t1_d1tlj86,12299.0,politics
399,"I didn't say Bernie Sanders doesn't have a good record on LGBT rights. He does. And it's true that Sanders never said ""I believe marriage is between a man and a woman."" But there's no proof that he was for same sex marriage before 2009.

When asked his position on same-sex marriage, he dodged it for years. Peter Freyne, a locally beloved Vermont writer and opinion writer whom Sanders later lauded as “the best political reporter in the state of Vermont,” accused the then-Congressman of obfuscating on his gay rights position. “Obtaining Congressman Bernie Sanders’ position on the gay marriage issue was like pulling teeth … from a rhinoceros,” Freyne wrote. Freyne described repeated attempts to hear Sanders’ views on gay marriage, and the congressman only said he “supports the current process” in the state legislature. “It’s an election year, yet despite the lack of a serious challenger, The Bern’s gut-level paranoia is acting up,” Freyne wrote. [source (Time)](http://time.com/4089946/bernie-sanders-gay-marriage/)

And in 2006, when asked if Vermont should legalize gay marriage, his answer was ""Not right now, not after what we went through,"" [source (The Washington Post)](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/03/sanders-evolving-and-wishy-washy-stance-on-same-sex-marriage/), saying he was more ""comfortable"" with civil unions. [[source]](http://time.com/4089946/bernie-sanders-gay-marriage/)
&gt; Sanders took a similarly cautious approach to same-sex marriage. In 2006, he took a stand against same-sex marriage in Vermont, stating that he instead endorsed civil unions. Sanders told the Associated Press that he was “comfortable” with civil unions, not full marriage equality. (To justify his stance, Sanders complained that a battle for same-sex marriage would be too “divisive.”) [–Slate, *Bernie Sanders Claims He’s a Longtime Champion of Marriage Equality. It’s Just Not True.*](http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2015/10/05/bernie_sanders_on_marriage_equality_he_s_no_longtime_champion.html)

Clearly, he wasn't an outspoken advocate for same sex marriage. And when it was unpopular for him politically while running for the Senate in 2006, he avoided taking a stand on it altogether. It was only after it became law in Vermont that he even passively voiced support for it.

To some of your other points:

&gt; 1993 - Bernie voted against ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell""

I have several gay friends who see this as a bad thing. As flawed as it was, DADT was an improvement over the outright ban of gays in the military that existed prior. Let's not forget that Bill Clinton campaigned on removing the ban on gays in the military outright in 1992, and lost a lot of political capital in the battle. Of course DADT should have been a much more temporary stopgap measure, and even Hillary Clinton spoke of repealing it since [at least 1999](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_ask,_don%27t_tell#Debate).

&gt; 1996 - Bernie voting against the Defense of Marriage act which classified marriage as ""a legal union between one man and one woman""

His rationale at the time was that marriage is a state's rights issue. Jane Sanders, his wife and campaign manager speaking on his behalf at the time said, ""We're not legislating values."" Also, my understanding is that Congress would have overridden a presidential veto.

I wrote another post on Clinton's gay rights record, which is imperfect but better than many on Reddit give her credit for: https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/47kepb/twitter_attacks_clintons_record_with_whichhillary/d0eg57u",2016-04-07 18:14:39+00:00,d1tuljc,11.0,t1_d1tsvnx,2153.0,politics

405,"I think there's a *real* false equivalency between Snowden's case and Clinton's emails. We are unaware of how much of the information in Clinton's emails were retroactively classified, and how much was ""over-classified"" as [some previous cabinet officials have called it](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/rice-aides-powell-also-got-classified-info-personal-emails-n511181). Hell, even mentioning or linking to a news article on the government's technically top secret, but publicly very well known, drone program qualifies as [Top Secret/SAP](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/officials-new-top-secret-clinton-emails-innocuous-n500586), the government's highest level of classification. We're not even sure if any of the emails that are now being called classified were sent by Clinton or merely received by her.

Secondly, is Colin Powell's use of an AOL (!) account for some of his emails as SoS any more secure than a private server? Or Rice's staffers use of personal email? They both had retroactively classified information found on there. Truth be told, even just the state.gov servers that much of this now-classified information was likely sent *from* are not supposed to transmit classified information either. There are other channels for transmitting classified information.

&gt; Clinton has said she viewed classified information in hard copy in her office. If she was traveling, she used other secure channels. ""The fact that no emails on her personal server were marked as classified suggests that she generally was doing her classified business on the secure government servers dedicated to that purpose,"" said Liza Goitein, co-director of the Brennan Center for Justice’s Liberty and National Security Program. [source](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/sep/10/hillary-clintons-emails-classified-or-not/)

And my understanding is that the laws surrounding the release of classified information depend greatly on intent, and knowingly releasing confidential information to those who should not see it. That's why General Petraeus was reprimanded (though, tellingly, *not thrown in jail*). He literally told his biographer/lover when handing over his notebooks, ""They are highly classified, some of them."" The intent was clear.

The Clinton email situation seems to me, from what I understand at this moment, more about out-of-date government protocol than it is about any criminal activity. Of course, I'm no expert on this situation, nor do I pretend to be. In fact, I freely admit there's quite a bit that none of us know about the situation. So, I'm deferring to the FBI and the DOJ to make their own determination without jumping to my own conclusions. I'm very skeptical of those self-proclaimed experts on Reddit who think they know everything here.

434,"&gt; You admit there is evidence of him acknowledging the genocide

No, I've admitted that there's no evidence, other than the word of his co-host, who also claims that Uygur never denied the genocide in the first place (which is demonstrably, provably false).

&gt; it sounds like a hearsay argument

Hearsay is literally the only ""evidence"" that Uygur has acknowledged the genocide. There are countless ways in which he could have acknowledged the genocide himself.

&gt; it came up in a Q&amp;A time and Cenk wasn't there, so she answered.

I'm not even sure what you're talking about here. Her response was a comment in response to a website's letter to the editor: http://armenianweekly.com/2009/02/26/letter-just-say-‘no’-to-the-young-turks/

&gt; Furthermore, you have no evidence of him ""ignoring"" the question

Sure, let's give him the benefit of the doubt on the AMA. I also provided evidence that despite claiming he wanted to ""resolve this issue"" with the Armenian community, him never speaking with them about it again, and never touching on the issue publicly again.

&gt; If such a video as evidence exists, it is either cited, in the YouTube videos for his channel (likely not highlighted as its own video) or saved In the members only video list on their site.

If there's a legitimate method that I could use to search for this video, please let me know and I will do so. But a rather lengthy search I've done for it, or for any evidence of its existence, has turned up empty.

&gt; and if he didn't then he would have spoken out against his co-host for saying he did.

Ah, I see. It would be easy for him to speak out against his co-hosts claims, but it's far too difficult for him to speak out about his own position on the matter? Even when confronted about it in various ways and settings?

Genocide denial is a serious issue. Would we be so cavalier about all of this if he had forcefully denied the Holocaust and then let someone else say that he no longer feels that way while not ever speaking about it himself publicly?",2016-03-27 18:36:40+00:00,d1fgp3k,7.0,t1_d1ffmmo,1870.0,politics

Also, Kasparian says in her vaunted [comment on a blogpost](http://armenianweekly.com/2009/02/26/letter-just-say-‘no’-to-the-young-turks/) (!):
""Cenk Uygur (the host) never denied the Genocide. When he was in college, he argued that although the genocide did occur, he didn’t believe it was considered a “genocide.”""

Um, that's the *definition* of [genocide denial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Genocide_denial). The Turkish government doesn't deny that Armenians died, they deny it was a *genocide*. That is the entire issue.

Secondly, she then mentions, ""Just the other day, he and I discussed the genocide on the show, he and literally admit that the genocide DID happen, and that the Turks SHOULD acknowledge it.""

Where is this video clip? Or transcript? Or any proof of this happening? I have been unable to find it.

441,"I'm going to answer this in good faith. I personally think there are few people that have ever been as qualified to be president as Hillary Clinton is in 2016. As the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/opinion/sunday/hillary-clinton-endorsement.html) put it in their endorsement of Clinton, ""Democratic primary voters, on the other hand, after a substantive debate over real issues, have the chance to nominate one of the most broadly and deeply qualified presidential candidates in modern history.""

Fresh out of Yale law school, she worked for the Children's Defense Fund going undercover to expose schools that discriminated against kids with disabilities, which helped lead to the [Individuals with Disabilities Education Act](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/28/us/politics/how-hillary-clinton-went-undercover-to-examine-race-in-education.html?_r=0). She was an instrumental member of the Clinton administration in the 1990s (and certainly one of the most accomplished first ladies in history), fighting for universal healthcare, speaking out about women's rights in China, helping to create the Children's Health Insurance Program, the Adoption and Safe Families Act, the Foster Care Independence Act, and the Office on Violence Against Women at the DOJ ([Source](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/09/carly-fiorina-debate-hillary-clintons-greatest-accomplishment-213157)). She also pushed for key decisions including the nomination of Madeleine Albright as SOS, expanding and defending [gay rights](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/clinton-white-house-gay-rights-hillary-clinton-staff-116859), and [increasing the research funding for illnesses](http://www.firstladies.org/biographies/firstladies.aspx?biography=43) such as prostate cancer and childhood asthma the NIH, as well as pushing for the creation of a presidential commission to [investigate Gulf War Syndrome](http://www.usnews.com/opinion/leslie-marshall/2014/02/19/hillary-clintons-accomplishments-speak-for-themselves).

As a Senator, she fought for and won 9/11 first responders care, expanded health care access for members of the National Guard and reservists, authored the Pediatric Research Equity Act, and championed the Lilly Ledbetter Pay Equity Act. She served on the Committees on Armed Services; Budget; Environment and Public Works; Health, Education, Labor and Pensions; and a Special Committee on Aging. She co-sponsored [74 bills that became law](https://www.congress.gov/advanced-search?raw=[%7B%22op%22:%22AND%22,%22conditions%22:[%7B%22op%22:%22AND%22,%22inputs%22:%7B%22source%22:%22legislation%22,%22field%22:%22congress%22,%22operator%22:%22is%22,%22value%22:%22all%22%7D%7D,%7B%22op%22:%22AND%22,%22inputs%22:%7B%22source%22:%22legislation%22,%22field%22:%22cosponsor%22,%22operator%22:%22contains%22,%22value%22:%22clinton%22%7D%7D,%7B%22op%22:%22AND%22,%22inputs%22:%7B%22source%22:%22legislation%22,%22field%22:%22bill-status%22,%22operator%22:%22is%22,%22value%22:%22law%22%7D%7D]%7D]).

Her Senate voting record matches Senator Sanders' 93% of the time. She is and [always has been liberal](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/hillary-clinton-was-liberal-hillary-clinton-is-liberal/), but one who is politically pragmatic and willing to reach across the aisle.

As Secretary of State, she repaired U.S. relations with many countries around the world, helped secure the START treaty ratification with Russia, negotiated a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, played a role in the killing of Osama Bin Laden, and laid the groundwork which ultimately led to both the normalization with Cuba and the Iran nuclear deal. Her foreign policy experience is unmatched by any candidate on either side of the aisle.

I think the policies she has put forward as a candidate, from Wall Street reform, to the expansion of healthcare coverage, implementation of cleaner energy solutions, and methods to help raise middle class incomes are great steps in the right direction and have a realistic chance of actually happening. I think she has a proven track record as a champion for progressive causes of both learning from her mistakes and getting things done.

Now, to address your concerns:

&gt; Her support of drone strikes against American citizens declared terrorist without trial

Source?

&gt; Her acceptance of donations from banks, private prison organizations and fracking industry organizations

* She takes donations from **employees** of banks, not the banks themselves. Her SuperPACs receive money from the banking industry. She is for [campaign finance reform](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/campaign-finance-reform/) (and has been since [before Bernie Sanders even entered the race](http://hillaryspeeches.com/2015/04/14/clinton-goes-to-iowa-day-1/)). She has a long history of Wall Street reform, which I wrote about in another [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/49fm9q/march_7_2016_fox_news_democratic_posttown_hall/d0rslxy). Hillary Clinton’s Wall Street plan has received praise from many economists, and many others on the left including [Elizabeth Warren](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/12/07/elizabeth-warren-praises-hillary-clintons-wall-street-plan/).

* She vowed to stop accepting money from private prisons in [October](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-private-prisons_us_562a3e3ee4b0ec0a389418ec), and the small portion of money she received from private prisons since then [her campaign donated to charity](http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2016/02/clinton-campaign-gives-private-prison-lobbyist-cash-to-charity-218524). And she has called to [end private prisons](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/criminal-justice-reform/).

* My understanding is that Clinton's position on fracking is much more in line with what the nuanced take the [scientific community](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-07/documents/hf_es_erd_jun2015.pdf) holds and the realities of energy production today: https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/mr-sanderss-fractured-reasoning-on-fracking/2016/03/08/938579aa-e4ab-11e5-bc08-3e03a5b41910_story.html

&gt; Her stand against gay rights in the 1990's

The only gay right you can say that she ""stood against"" was gay marriage. At the time, she was [instead for civil unions with full benefits](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/17/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-change-position-same-sex-marriage/). (Bernie Sanders similarly [advocated for civil unions over fighting to legalize gay marriage](http://time.com/4089946/bernie-sanders-gay-marriage/)) back then, and [Sanders did not support gay marriage until 2009](http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2015/10/05/bernie_sanders_on_marriage_equality_he_s_no_longtime_champion.html), only after Vermont legalized it. 

Hillary Clinton actually has a pretty good record of fighting for gay rights since the 1990s, which I wrote about in another [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/47kepb/twitter_attacks_clintons_record_with_whichhillary/d0eg57u).

&gt; Her being the current target of multiple Federal nvestigations, the first presidential contender to possibly ever hold that distinction

I’ll let the FBI come to a decision before I jump to my own conclusions on this one. I don’t believe she’s even close to being the [only one](http://www.ibtimes.com/chris-christie-administration-target-new-federal-criminal-probe-1806644) even just looking at [this election cycle](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/08/06/new-docs-show-walker-may-have-lied-about-john-doe-ties.html)…

&gt; Her unwavering support of Israel despite evidence that Israel shares blame for the current condition of the Middle East

The situation and her position are much more complicated than you make them sound here. I could make a whole other post about the complexities of the Israel/Palestinian conflict without coming to a clear conclusion.

&gt; Her support of the Iraqi invasion

Can’t defend that one. That’s definitely my biggest objection I have in Clinton’s record.

&gt; Her declaration of support for NSA data gathering techniques ruled illegal by the United States Supreme Court

I don’t believe the Supreme Court has taken any case involving the NSA. Also, [Hillary Clinton endorsed the USA Freedom Act nearly a year ago](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/hillary-clinton-endorses-nsa-reform-bill) that would put an end to the NSA’s bulk collection of data.

&gt; Her lack of understanding of basic technology/her attempt to cover up her understanding of technology as seen in the current situation involving get private email server

&gt; Her desire to see Edward Snowden imprisoned, denying him whistleblower protection

Same position as [Senator Sanders](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/10/14/clinton-and-sanders-snowden-should-face-prosecution/).

&gt; Her previous comments insinuating the violent behavior of gang criminals was genetic in nature (super predators)

444,"The only out-and-out lie I see in this video is the Bosnia sniper fire story. Don’t know what that was about. The rest of the video is a combination of changes on certain positions, old quotes taken out of context, nuanced stances, and semantic debates.

* **Gay marriage**: Yes, Hillary Clinton was against it before, and was [instead for civil unions with full benefits](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/17/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-change-position-same-sex-marriage/) (Bernie Sanders similarly [advocated for civil unions over fighting to legalize gay marriage](http://time.com/4089946/bernie-sanders-gay-marriage/)). And let's remember that [Sanders did not support gay marriage until 2009](http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2015/10/05/bernie_sanders_on_marriage_equality_he_s_no_longtime_champion.html), and only after Vermont legalized it. Like many people in politics, including President Obama (and much of the country in general), she evolved on the issue of gay marriage and now supports it. There’s a change in position here, but I don’t see where the lie is.

* **Progressive vs. Moderate**: I don’t understand the importance of this semantic debate between progressive and moderate. First of all, I don’t believe these terms are mutually exclusive. One can be a moderate progressive, just as one can be a moderate conservative. Secondly, [according to an analysis of roll call votes by Voteview](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/hillary-clinton-was-liberal-hillary-clinton-is-liberal/), Clinton’s record was more liberal than 70 percent of Democrats in her final term in the Senate. She was more liberal than 85 percent of all members (including more liberal than Senator Obama). [OnTheIssues.org rates Clinton as a “hard core liberal”](http://www.ontheissues.org/hillary_clinton.htm), as liberal as [Elizabeth Warren](http://www.ontheissues.org/senate/Elizabeth_Warren.htm) and barely more moderate than [Bernie Sanders](http://www.ontheissues.org/house/Bernie_Sanders.htm). To say that one fights for [progressive values](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/hillary-clinton-was-liberal-hillary-clinton-is-liberal/) while also trying to find common ground and areas in which actual progress can be made doesn’t seem like a negative to me. As they say, don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.

* **Emails: 90-95%**: Let’s put aside the fact that the only two other Secretaries of State to use email before Sec. Clinton also [used private email accounts on which they received “classified” information](http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/04/politics/hillary-clinton-email-classified-colin-powell-condoleezza-rice/). She may have been incorrect that the 90-95% figure came from the State Department, but that doesn’t make the number itself untrue. The vast majority of emails sent and received were to others with State Department email addresses, meaning those emails would be [in the State Dept. system](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/us/hillary-clinton-emails-take-long-path-to-controversy.html?_r=0). In fact, this was [Colin Powell's same rationale](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/colin-powell-hillary-clinton-email-state-department-115870) for freely and independently deleting all of the emails from his personal AOL (!) account that he used while SoS: ""I don’t have any to turn over. I did not keep a cache of them. I did not print them off. I do not have thousands of pages somewhere in my personal files. A lot of the emails that came out of my personal account went into the State Department system. They were addressed to State Department employees and state.gov domain...""

* **Emails: Piles of Libya Emails**: Seriously? Where’s the lie?

* **Emails: Bill’s Two Emails**: I can’t find the full video of Bill Clinton saying he only ever sent two emails, but I’m pretty sure he’s referring to his time as president. In other instances he has [talked about emailing](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bill-clinton-serves-warm-act-katy-perry-clinton/story?id=34709400) since his presidency.

* **On Wall Street: “Blaming” Homebuyers**: I wrote [a whole other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/47deig/how_is_this_video_of_clinton_blaming_homeowners/d0c59kd) addressing this out-of-context clip.

* **On Wall Street: Investment Banks**: One’s opinion on big money in politics aside, let’s look at what’s happening in this particular instance. At this particular debate, Hillary Clinton (not Bernie Sanders) is bringing up the risk that investment banks specifically pose. If the logic is that being in the pocket of an investment bank means favorable treatment, why would she call out investment banks? Also, where’s the lie? And on a side note, Hillary Clinton’s Wall Street plan has received praise from many economists and many on the left, including [Elizabeth Warren](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/12/07/elizabeth-warren-praises-hillary-clintons-wall-street-plan/).

* **On Universal Healthcare**: Hillary Clinton doesn’t agree that Single Payer is the best way to achieve universal healthcare in this country (especially after the protracted battle we’ve had over the last 7 years), and instead favors improvements to the ACA to cover the remaining 9-10% of uninsured Americans, including reviving the [public option](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/health-care/). She's been [fighting for universal healthcare since 1993](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_health_care_plan_of_1993) and never once proposed Single Payer. Lots of people seem to think that “Single Payer” is synonymous with Universal Healthcare, or that it’s the only way to achieve it, and that’s [simply not true](http://www.forbes.com/sites/danmunro/2013/12/08/universal-coverage-is-not-single-payer-healthcare/#60a15fc47f5d).

* **NAFTA**: It’s almost as if she has a mixed opinion of NAFTA, and nuanced opinions on free trade in general. It seems to me that she believes in free trade agreements in principle, if not always in the way they’re implemented, and learned from NAFTA the importance of adding protections for American jobs. So yes, as First Lady, she spoke favorably of NAFTA, though by 1998 she was already [publicly expressing concerns about it](http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/04/21/401123124/a-timeline-of-hillary-clintons-evolution-on-trade): “I would add that there does need to be sensitivity to worker and environmental concerns in trade agreements going forward in the future.” According to [Politifact](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/25/barack-obama/clinton-has-changed-on-nafta/), “We should note that Clinton biographer Sally Bedell Smith has said that as first lady, Clinton opposed NAFTA privately but supported it publicly because it was important to her husband politically.” Many of the clips and quotes included in the video also often have her expressing some concern about it, though of course those parts are cut out. In 2000, she said, “What happened to NAFTA, I think, was we inherited an agreement that we didn't get everything we should have got out of it in my opinion. I think the NAFTA agreement was flawed. The problem is we have to go back and figure out how we are going to fix that.” Then the video takes the following 2004 quote out of context: “I think on balance NAFTA has been good for New York and America, but I also think that there are a number of areas where we're not dealt with in an upfront way in dealing with our friend to the north, Canada, which seems to be able to come up with a number of rationales for keeping New York agricultural products out of Canada.” Then in 2007, “I believe in the general principles it represented, but what we have learned is that we have to drive a tougher bargain. Our market is the market that everybody wants to be in. We should quit giving it away so willy-nilly. I believe we need tougher enforcement of the trade agreements we already have. You look at the trade enforcement record between the Clinton Administration and the Bush Administration, the Clinton Administration brought more trade enforcement actions in one year than the Bush Administration brought in six years. For me, trade is who we are. We're traders. We want to be involved in the global economy, but not be played for suckers… Look, NAFTA did not do what many had hoped, and so we do need to take a look at it and we do need to figure out how we're going to have trade relations that are smart, that give the American worker and the American consumer rights around the world.” And most recently with the TPP, yes she supported it in principle, but once the language was actually finalized, she felt that it [fell short](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-singh-grewal/why-hillary-clinton-is-ri_b_8295420.html). “It was just finally negotiated last week, and in looking at it, it didn't meet my standards. My standards for more new, good jobs for Americans, for raising wages for Americans. And I want to make sure that I can look into the eyes of any middle-class American and say, ‘this will help raise your wages.’ And I concluded I could not.” [source](http://www.ontheissues.org/2016/Hillary_Clinton_Free_Trade.htm)

Anecdotally, I was getting health insurance through an employer up until about 4 or 5 years ago, and during that time my premiums went up by a large margin (and coverage went down) every single year. I was even forced to change my doctor when they stopped offering a particular type of insurance. This was all before Obamacare.

I left that job and started working freelance, and for two years before the ACA exchanges were implemented, I got the most affordable decent individual healthcare plan I could find (which wasn't very cheap, and wasn't all that great). Once the ACA exchanges started, my premiums were cut in half and my coverage was far better than anything I could afford pre-ACA (and this was without any federal subsidies). Since then, my premiums have barely risen over the last two years.

It's unfortunate that yours went up so much. Overall, health premium growth actually [slowed to its lowest rate ever recorded in 2013 &amp; 2014](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/12/03/us-health-spending-grows-at-lowest-rate/19830573/) and continued to be low (4.2%) through [2015](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/09/22/new-data-show-slow-health-care-cost-growth-continuing). A decade ago, most plans were seeing [double-digit increases](http://kff.org/health-costs/report/2014-employer-health-benefits-survey/).
&gt;Employer-sponsored health insurance premiums grew more slowly in 31 states and the District of Columbia between 2010 and 2013 -- after the passage of Obamacare -- compared with 2003 to 2010, according to the nonpartisan foundation the Commonwealth Fund.

448,"Sorry to hear that. Anecdotally, my insurance premiums were cut in half (without any federal subsidies), and my coverage was much improved from the individual plan I was able to get pre-Obamacare.

While some have seen rises in premiums (mostly in states with fewer insurance companies/less competition, and ones that turned down federal funding to expand Medicaid), most people have seen lower costs due to subsidies according to the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/10/27/us/is-the-affordable-care-act-working.html?_r=0#affordability).
&gt;Eighty-five percent of those who signed up during the enrollment period qualified for federal subsidies to help pay premiums. For those who qualified for subsidies through the federal exchange, the subsidies lowered the cost by 76 percent on average, according to the Obama administration.

A recent [Commonwealth Fund study](http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/press-releases/2015/jan/biennial-health-insurance-survey) found that in 2014 (the first year the ACA exchanges were in effect), fewer Americans had problems paying medical bills or medical debt, and fewer went without care because they couldn’t afford it. This is the first decline and lowest level in these areas since 2005.

Also, health premium growth [slowed to its lowest rate ever recorded in 2013 &amp; 2014](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/12/03/us-health-spending-grows-at-lowest-rate/19830573/) and has continued to be low (4.2%) through [2015](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/09/22/new-data-show-slow-health-care-cost-growth-continuing).

""I'm proud to have been part of the administration that banned torture, after too many years in which we had lost our way. If I'm president, the United States will not condone or practice torture anywhere in the world. Even when we're up against opponents who don't respect human life or human rights, torture is not the right choice.

461,"I'll try to respond to some of the items you bring up in good faith, but more often than not these types of posts aren't actually questions, just a hardly-veiled attack.

&gt; I have spent probably 10+ hours researching Hillary and over and over I find what seems to be evidence of mendacity.

And yet I don't see any sources for any of the statements you make.

&gt; Previous secretaries of state did indeed conduct State business on their personal email, but this was occasional. 

Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice (the only two Secretaries of State to ever use email before Clinton) used personal email accounts, and have had some of their personal emails [retroactively classified](http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/04/politics/hillary-clinton-email-classified-colin-powell-condoleezza-rice/).

Colin Powell used an [AOL](http://www.newsweek.com/colin-powell-emails-hillary-clinton-424187)(!) account that [he literally just deleted when his tenure as SoS was up](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/colin-powell-hillary-clinton-email-state-department-115870). He relied on emailing colleagues at their state.gov addresses for his emails to be captured by the State Dept. servers, same as Hillary Clinton did.

&gt; Hillary on the other hand had a personal server specifically set up to handle ALL emails, state and personal alike.

Firstly, a state.gov email would be no different security-wise. Classified info is not allowed to be transmitted on there either. (Not to mention the fact that [the State Department's servers have provably been infiltrated by suspected Russian hackers](http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/10/politics/state-department-hack-worst-ever/), while the State Dept said there's [no indication Clinton's servers have been breached](http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2015/03/238132.htm#DEPARTMENT)). The State Department has a separate secure system for transmitting classified information. Secondly:

""Clinton has said she viewed classified information in hard copy in her office. If she was traveling, she used other secure channels. 'The fact that no emails on her personal server were marked as classified suggests that she generally was doing her classified business on the secure government servers dedicated to that purpose,' said Liza Goitein, co-director of the Brennan Center for Justice’s Liberty and National Security Program."" [source](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/sep/10/hillary-clintons-emails-classified-or-not/)

&gt; Claiming this was for convenience is really no excuse as it is a clear breach in government protocol.

False. ""It was only after Clinton left the State Department, that the National Archives issued a recommendation that government employees should avoid conducting official business on personal emails (though they noted there might be extenuating circumstances such as an emergency that require it). Additionally, in 2014, President Barack Obama signed changes to the Federal Records Act that explicitly said federal officials can only use personal email addresses if they also copy or send the emails to their official account. Because these rules weren't in effect when Clinton was in office, 'she was in compliance with the laws and regulations at the time,' said Gary Bass, founder and former director of OMB Watch, a government accountability organization.""

I, for one, am not going to sit back and act like an armchair legal and government classification expert. I think I'll refrain from making bold statements about the legality of the situation until the FBI has finished weighing in on the matter.

&gt; Hillary deleted 30,000 emails that were “personal” but in no other situation would this be accepted.

Again, false. “There is no question that former Secretary Clinton had authority to delete personal emails without agency supervision — she appropriately could have done so even if she were working on a government server,” attorneys from the Justice Department’s civil division wrote. The government said Judicial Watch had presented no evidence to suggest Clinton had mistakenly or intentionally deleted government records instead of personal emails, and said “government agencies are not required to take steps to recover deleted material based on unfounded speculation that responsive information had been deleted.” [source](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/hillary-clinton-was-allowed-delete-personal-emails-server-doj)

&gt; Beyond this, her leadership in the Benghazi affair was disastrous.

Congress has spent more time investigating Benghazi [than they did 9/11](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/01/democrats-benghazi-panel-217402). During George W. Bush's administration there were [13 attacks on embassies and over 60 deaths](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/12/john-garamendi/prior-benghazi-were-there-13-attacks-embassies-and/). Clearly mistakes were made and things need to be learned from this situation, but why are we all so eager to politicize the death of Americans?

&gt; Her ties to the Clinton foundation are equally troubling.

The American Institute of Philanthropy's Charity Watch gave the foundation [an ""A"" rating](https://www.charitywatch.org/ratings-and-metrics/bill-hillary-chelsea-clinton-foundation/478). The previous year, they gave them an A+ rating.

""Regardless of whether you like [Hillary Clinton's] politics or not, this is a good charity,"" said [President Daniel Borochoff](https://twitter.com/danielborochoff/status/593117143195000832).

During her tenure as Secretary of State, she had [an agreement in place to avoid conflict of interest](http://media.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/documents/memorandum_of_understanding_clinton.pdf).

471,"&gt; Can he make the case at the convention that he has the momentum and he is the most electable to get SDs to switch?

Mathematically it's still *technically* possible for him to win the votes/pledged delegates outright if something changed dramatically, though far, *far* from probable (as someone pointed out, he would need to get an average of at least 58% of the vote in all remaining states, and each state he underperforms in just makes that number higher). If he were to win the majority of pledged delegates, then super delegates would switch over to him just as they did for Obama in 2008. But keep in mind no one has ever recovered from even a 100 delegate deficit (Sanders is currently down over *300*), and the person that came closest to doing so was Hillary Clinton in 2008.

&gt; Regionally, he lost the south (which will go GOP anyway)

Obama did better in the South in 2008, and we all know how that turned out for him. It doesn't matter who does better in the deep red or deep blue states, they'll vote that way pretty much regardless. What really matters is the swing states: Ohio, Colorado, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, Virginia, and Florida. Clinton has won 5/7 of them, and chances are at least New Hampshire will vote blue this year (they have for the last three elections).

&gt; Also, the more people hear him the more they like him, whereas the opposite has proven true for Hillary.

Bernie Sanders has not been the subject of a national negative campaign. Hillary Clinton's dirty laundry has been airing out for the last 25 years. And after leaving her post as Secretary of State, Republicans have been [hellbent on bringing down her poll numbers](http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/10/politics/benghazi-committee-investigation-political-hillary-clinton-brad-podliska-lawsuit/), and it's worked to a degree.

Republicans are salivating over the prospect of running against Bernie Sanders, and have been [actually trying to help him thus far](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-01-19/republican-operatives-are-trying-to-help-bernie-sanders). If he were to win the nomination, that would of course change. Bernie Sanders has never undergone the onslaught of Republican attack ads (and Hillary Clinton, despite what some Sanders supporters might think, has treated him with kid gloves compared to the '08 campaign). And even as someone who likes Bernie Sanders and much of his platform, I think it would be very easy to write those attack ads. Bernie Sanders simply hasn't undergone that type of scrutiny in the national spotlight before, which is why those general election polls many cite at this stage of the game are meaningless (or else Mitt Romney would currently be our president).

&gt; Do they really want to put somebody who's poll numbers go down the longer she campaigns in front of general election voters?

Clearly the majority of Democratic primary voters thus far think she's the better candidate. She's also the only candidate on either side of the aisle who has [received more votes than Donald Trump and Ted Cruz](http://bluenationreview.com/hillary-has-more-votes-than-trump-or-bernie/).

She gave specific proposals for addressing subprime mortgages, including expanding the role of the Federal Housing Administration, more borrowing options for underprivileged and first-time homebuyers, more safeguards against predatory lending practices and policies intended to prevent foreclosures.

And then [sponsored a bill in the Senate](https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/senate-bill/2114) to implement those policies in September 2007.

And then [gave a speech in November 2007](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/08/us/08wallst.html) calling out the risks posed by derivatives and pushed for more oversight, angering her Wall Street donors. (The [New York Times wrote](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/08/us/08wallst.html), ""She was early to call for tougher regulation of financial derivatives and private-equity markets."")

A plan that included, in part, more oversight of derivatives and other new financial products, establishment of mortgage standards and strengthened consumer protections. Much of her proposals ended up in the Dodd-Frank bill passed under President Obama.

And in 2008 [she also proposed](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=96569) that financial institutions involved with derivatives be ""subject to minimum capital requirements ...based on the principle that capital requirements related to risk should be applied to all bank-like institutions that issue credit.""

That clip is taking a very small portion of a counterpoint made in her speech out of context, the main thrust of which was warning of the volatility of subprime mortgages and that she wanted Wall Street banks to bear some of the burden of providing financial relief to families facing foreclosure back in 2007.

&gt; ""Now, who's exactly to blame for the housing crisis? Well, that's always a question that the press and people ask and I think there's plenty of blame to go around.

&gt; Responsibility belongs to mortgage lenders and brokers, who irresponsibly lowered underwriting standards, pushed risky mortgages, and hid the details in the fine print.

&gt; Responsibility belongs to the Administration and to regulators, who failed to provide adequate oversight, and who failed to respond to the chorus of reports that millions of families were being taken advantage of.

&gt; Responsibility belongs to the rating agencies, who woefully underestimated the risks involved in mortgage securities.

&gt; And certainly borrowers share responsibility as well. Homebuyers who paid extra fees to avoid documenting their income should have known they were getting in over their heads. Speculators who were busy buying two, three, four houses to sell for a quick buck don't deserve our sympathy.

&gt; But finally, responsibility also belongs to Wall Street, which not only enabled but often encouraged reckless mortgage lending. Mortgage lenders didn't have balance sheets big enough to write millions of loans on their own. So Wall Street originated and packaged the loans that common sense warned might very well have ended in collapse and foreclosure. **Some people might say Wall Street only helped to distribute risk. I believe Wall Street shifted risk away from people who knew what was going on onto the people who did not.**"" –Hillary Clinton [source](http://www.vox.com/2015/11/12/9716034/hillary-clinton-nasdaq-speech)

498,"That article is crazy! Thanks for that, it definitely adds an interesting perspective.

Firstly, I found it interesting that they believe Trump's proposals would have no effect on them (though I suppose that's what a criminal would say):

&amp;gt; The Mexican people are well aware of what Trump has been saying about them, Lopez added, but no one he knows seems to care all that much. His comments suggest that even Trump's draconian policies wouldn't put an end to cross-border criminal activity. ""No big wall or fence can stop us,"" he says. ""Our politicians are bought off by the cartels, and the cartels and politicians want us in the United States, too.""

It seems to me like a better way to address this situation would be to end or drastically change our approach to the war on drugs. Also, the fact that they can use the social security numbers of deceased Americans speaks to other problems in our system...

Secondly, I think there's a big difference between corruptible Mexican border patrol officers and a system in which a foreign government has a policy of sending their worst criminals into the US. Other than that one guy's account (who seems to trump up their reach and power – no pun intended – to make himself sound more important than he likely is), there doesn't seem to be any evidence to back up the claim in terms of an actual policy and in terms of the numbers.

Which brings me to my last point: that, as the article itself says, this is ""a small, shady subset of a larger demographic that generally obeys the law and contributes to the US economy."" Studies show that [less than 5%](http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2014/aug/29/david-dewhurst/unsupported-claim-1-4-apprehended-border-crossers-/) of immigrants captured by its agents near the southern border had a prior U.S. immigration or criminal conviction (and it's not clear how much of that 5% had previous problems because of immigration vs. other criminal activity). And some studies have shown that foreign born Mexicans living in the United States have [an incarceration rate of 0.7%](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/06/donald-trump/trump-immigration-claim-has-no-data-back-it/), which is far below the national average of 3.5% (and the reason they're behind bars is often tied to immigration offenses). And on a side note, immigration from Mexico is actually on the decline, and [for 2010-2014 there was zero net migration from Mexico](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/jun/22/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-zero-net-migration-mexico-2010/) (some even say it may have been negative).

These statistics are not exactly accurately reflected in Mr. Trump's language (in fact, they seem to be completely flipped around):

&gt; ""When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.""",2016-03-01 19:31:53+00:00,d0jpijw,6.0,t1_d0j82gh,30279.0,PoliticalDiscussion
499,"Firstly, I just want to say I really appreciate your thoughtful replies in this thread. But this caught my eye:

&gt; On illegal immigration, he gets tremendous flak for saying that Mexico allows the export of its criminals here. He was immediately called racist against all Mexicans, the standard reply to any border enforcement for the last 20 years. However, no one ever points out how cities have also been doing the same thing. San Francisco has a tremendous homeless and crime problem that's spiked in recent years. It's because other cities like Reno are literally putting their unwanted burdens on greyhound buses to other places. NYC is one of the few cities that acknowledges they ship out their homeless.

503,"That clip is taking a very small portion of a counterpoint made in her speech out of context, the main thrust of which was warning of the volatility of subprime mortgages and that she wanted Wall Street banks to bear some of the burden of providing financial relief to families facing foreclosure back in 2007.

&gt; ""Now, who's exactly to blame for the housing crisis? Well, that's always a question that the press and people ask and I think there's plenty of blame to go around.

&gt; Responsibility belongs to mortgage lenders and brokers, who irresponsibly lowered underwriting standards, pushed risky mortgages, and hid the details in the fine print.

&gt; Responsibility belongs to the Administration and to regulators, who failed to provide adequate oversight, and who failed to respond to the chorus of reports that millions of families were being taken advantage of.

&gt; Responsibility belongs to the rating agencies, who woefully underestimated the risks involved in mortgage securities.

&gt; And certainly borrowers share responsibility as well. Homebuyers who paid extra fees to avoid documenting their income should have known they were getting in over their heads. Speculators who were busy buying two, three, four houses to sell for a quick buck don't deserve our sympathy.

&gt; But finally, responsibility also belongs to Wall Street, which not only enabled but often encouraged reckless mortgage lending. Mortgage lenders didn't have balance sheets big enough to write millions of loans on their own. So Wall Street originated and packaged the loans that common sense warned might very well have ended in collapse and foreclosure. **Some people might say Wall Street only helped to distribute risk. I believe Wall Street shifted risk away from people who knew what was going on onto the people who did not.**"" –Hillary Clinton [source](http://www.vox.com/2015/11/12/9716034/hillary-clinton-nasdaq-speech)",2016-02-27 22:15:51+00:00,d0g7uoz,4.0,t1_d0g7hfy,641.0,politics
504,"I appreciate your post as well. Taking issues with the legislation itself is completely valid. There were many people in this thread saying that she did nothing beyond saying, ""Cut it out"" to Wall Street, and others specifically saying she didn't introduce legislation, which is simply not true.

Sanders](http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/17/politics/bernie-sanders-wall-street-deregulation-debate/) either). Many of the proposals she campaigned on in 2008 made their way into the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform bill. In 2008, she [championed Elizabeth Warren’s idea of a Financial Product Safety Commission](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/12/18/hillary-clinton-s-own-populist-path.html) (it's bullet #2 [here](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=92146)), which became known as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau when it was implemented as part of Dodd-Frank. She also [called for addressing the conflicts-of-interest](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=96569) between credit rating agencies and financial institutions and, two years later, the Dodd-Frank law [enhanced SEC oversight](http://www.sec.gov/spotlight/dodd-frank/creditratingagencies.shtml) of these agencies.

She also [introduced legislation](https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/senate-bill/2866) to provide shareholders a vote on executive compensation, especially on ""golden parachutes."" [Dodd Frank](https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/4173/) included similar ""say on pay"" provisions. Her bill also would have created a three year look-back period (""claw-back"" policy) within which the SEC could require CEOs and CFOs to repay bonuses, profits or other compensation if they were found to have overseen or been complicit in corporate misconduct or illicit activity.

She called for [closing the ""carried interest"" loophole](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/14/business/14tax.html?pagewanted=print&amp;_r=0), stating she would, ""ensure that the carried interest earned by some multimillionaire Wall Street managers is recognized for what it is: ordinary income that should be taxed at ordinary income tax rates.""

And in 2008 [she also proposed](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=96569) that financial institutions involved with derivatives be ""subject to minimum capital requirements ...based on the principle that capital requirements related to risk should be applied to all bank-like institutions that issue credit.""

That bill, prompted by a series in the Chicago Tribune, dealt primarily with mortgage fraud, but when he introduced the bill he noted that it ""also protects the legal rights of borrowers with risky, subprime loans. The greatest growth in the mortgage lending market is in subprime loans and some have estimated that more than 2 million homeowners with subprime mortgages are at risk of losing their homes.""

The article also points out:

&gt; [Hillary Clinton's] campaign also sent us a letter she wrote in July 2006 to the chairman and ranking Democrat on a Senate appropriations subcommittee asking them to include provisions to expand the Federal Housing Administration, which she said would help provide ""a real alternative to the sub-prime and predatory lending market.""

* The Clinton administration was also the first to appoint openly gay people to an administration post, and they appointed many others to the judiciary and other positions in the government. [source](http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Bill_Clinton_Civil_Rights.htm) Bill Clinton also issued two landmark executive orders: one that banned discrimination in the federal government's civilian work force on the basis of sexual orientation, and another that ended the 50-year ban on granting security clearances to gay men and lesbians. [source](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/10/opinion/in-government-and-incidentally-gay.html)

* Many people look back at Don't Ask Don't Tell as a negative (and certainly today’s full acceptance of gays in the armed forces is much better), but in the early 1990s that was actually a win against outright banning gays in the military. Bill Clinton [actually campaigned on ending the ban on gays in the military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_ask,_don%27t_tell#Origin), and this was the compromise they could reach. And Hillary pushed for gays to be able to serve openly in the military since [at least 1999](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_ask,_don%27t_tell#Debate).

* Hillary and her staff in the Clinton administration were instrumental in furthering and protecting gay rights. ""The records released by the National Archives at the Clinton Library here Thursday demonstrate that Hillary Clinton’s staff took a progressive stand on other gay-rights issues and helped push to torpedo anti-gay-rights legislation."" She and her staff in the Clinton administration ""pushed for government-wide vetting of an executive order to ban federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation...

514,"If you were actually still looking for a response to your questions:

1) On the NSA, last May [she endorsed the USA Freedom Act](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/hillary-clinton-endorses-nsa-reform-bill) which would end the NSA’s bulk collection of data, saying, “Congress should move ahead now with the USA Freedom Act — a good step forward in ongoing efforts to protect our security &amp; civil liberties.”

2) If you’re referring to the “[Hillary Clinton lying for 13 minutes straight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dY77j6uBHI)” YouTube video, the only out-and-out lie I see in it is the Bosnia sniper fire story. Don’t know what that was about. The rest of the video is a combination of changes on certain positions, old quotes taken out of context, nuanced stances, and semantic debates.

* **Gay marriage**: Yes, Hillary Clinton was against it before, and was [instead for civil unions with full benefits](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/17/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-change-position-same-sex-marriage/) (Bernie Sanders similarly [advocated for civil unions over fighting to legalize gay marriage](http://time.com/4089946/bernie-sanders-gay-marriage/), though he did not express the same “marriage is between a man and a woman” stance). Like many people in politics, including President Obama (and much of the country in general), she evolved on the issue of gay marriage and now supports it. There’s a change in position here, but I don’t see where the lie is.

* **Progressive vs. Moderate**: I don’t understand the importance of this semantic debate between progressive and moderate. First of all, I don’t believe these terms are mutually exclusive. One can be a moderate progressive, just as one can be a moderate conservative. But to say that one fights for progressive values while also trying to find common ground and areas in which actual progress can be made doesn’t seem like a negative to me. As they say, don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.

* **Emails: 90-95%**: Let’s put aside the fact that the only two other Secretaries of State to use email before Sec. Clinton also [used private email accounts on which they received “classified” information](http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/04/politics/hillary-clinton-email-classified-colin-powell-condoleezza-rice/). She may have been incorrect that the 90-95% figure came from the State Department, but that doesn’t make the number itself untrue. The vast majority of emails sent and received were to others with State Department email addresses, meaning those emails would be [in the State Dept. system](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/us/hillary-clinton-emails-take-long-path-to-controversy.html?_r=0).

* **Emails: Piles of Libya Emails**: Seriously? Where’s the lie?

* **Emails: Bill’s Two Emails**: I can’t find the full video of Bill Clinton saying he only ever sent two emails, but I’m pretty sure he’s referring to his time as president. In other instances he has [talked about emailing](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bill-clinton-serves-warm-act-katy-perry-clinton/story?id=34709400) since his presidency.

* **On Wall Street: “Blaming” Homebuyers**: I wrote [a whole other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/47deig/how_is_this_video_of_clinton_blaming_homeowners/d0c59kd) addressing this out of context clip.

* **On Wall Street: Investment Banks**: One’s opinion on big money in politics aside, let’s look at what’s happening in this particular instance. At this particular debate, Hillary Clinton (not Bernie Sanders) is bringing up the risk that investment banks specifically pose. If the logic is that being in the pocket of an investment bank means favorable treatment, why would she call out investment banks? Also, where’s the lie? And on a side note, Hillary Clinton’s Wall Street plan has received praise from many on the left, including [Elizabeth Warren](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/12/07/elizabeth-warren-praises-hillary-clintons-wall-street-plan/).

* **On Universal Healthcare**: Hillary Clinton doesn’t agree that Single Payer is the best way to achieve universal healthcare in this country (especially after the protracted battle we’ve had over the last 7 years), and instead favors improvements to the ACA to cover the remaining 9-10% of uninsured Americans, including reviving the [public option](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/health-care/). Lots of people seem to think that “Single Payer” is synonymous with Universal Healthcare, or that it’s the only way to achieve it, and that’s [simply not true](http://www.forbes.com/sites/danmunro/2013/12/08/universal-coverage-is-not-single-payer-healthcare/#60a15fc47f5d).

* **NAFTA**: It’s almost as if she has a mixed opinion of NAFTA, and nuanced opinions on free trade in general. It seems to me that she believes in free trade agreements in principle, if not always in the way they’re implemented, and learned from NAFTA the importance of adding protections for American jobs. So yes, as First Lady, she spoke favorably of NAFTA, though by 1998 she was already [publicly expressing concerns about it](http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/04/21/401123124/a-timeline-of-hillary-clintons-evolution-on-trade): “I would add that there does need to be sensitivity to worker and environmental concerns in trade agreements going forward in the future.” According to [Politifact](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/25/barack-obama/clinton-has-changed-on-nafta/), “We should note that Clinton biographer Sally Bedell Smith has said that as first lady, Clinton opposed NAFTA privately but supported it publicly because it was important to her husband politically.” Many of the clips and quotes included in the video also often have her expressing some concern about it, though of course those parts are cut out. In 2000, she said, “What happened to NAFTA, I think, was we inherited an agreement that we didn't get everything we should have got out of it in my opinion. I think the NAFTA agreement was flawed. The problem is we have to go back and figure out how we are going to fix that.” Then the video takes the following 2004 quote out of context: “I think on balance NAFTA has been good for New York and America, but I also think that there are a number of areas where we're not dealt with in an upfront way in dealing with our friend to the north, Canada, which seems to be able to come up with a number of rationales for keeping New York agricultural products out of Canada.” Then in 2007, “I believe in the general principles it represented, but what we have learned is that we have to drive a tougher bargain. Our market is the market that everybody wants to be in. We should quit giving it away so willy-nilly. I believe we need tougher enforcement of the trade agreements we already have. You look at the trade enforcement record between the Clinton Administration and the Bush Administration, the Clinton Administration brought more trade enforcement actions in one year than the Bush Administration brought in six years. For me, trade is who we are. We're traders. We want to be involved in the global economy, but not be played for suckers… Look, NAFTA did not do what many had hoped, and so we do need to take a look at it and we do need to figure out how we're going to have trade relations that are smart, that give the American worker and the American consumer rights around the world.” And most recently with the TPP, yes she supported it in principle, but once the language was actually finalized, she felt that it [fell short](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-singh-grewal/why-hillary-clinton-is-ri_b_8295420.html). “It was just finally negotiated last week, and in looking at it, it didn't meet my standards. My standards for more new, good jobs for Americans, for raising wages for Americans. And I want to make sure that I can look into the eyes of any middle-class American and say, ‘this will help raise your wages.’ And I concluded I could not.” [source](http://www.ontheissues.org/2016/Hillary_Clinton_Free_Trade.htm)

&gt; ""Now, who's exactly to blame for the housing crisis? Well, that's always a question that the press and people ask and I think there's plenty of blame to go around.

&gt; Responsibility belongs to mortgage lenders and brokers, who irresponsibly lowered underwriting standards, pushed risky mortgages, and hid the details in the fine print.

&gt; Responsibility belongs to the Administration and to regulators, who failed to provide adequate oversight, and who failed to respond to the chorus of reports that millions of families were being taken advantage of.

&gt; Responsibility belongs to the rating agencies, who woefully underestimated the risks involved in mortgage securities.

&gt; And certainly borrowers share responsibility as well. Homebuyers who paid extra fees to avoid documenting their income should have known they were getting in over their heads. Speculators who were busy buying two, three, four houses to sell for a quick buck don't deserve our sympathy.

&gt; But finally, responsibility also belongs to Wall Street, which not only enabled but often encouraged reckless mortgage lending. Mortgage lenders didn't have balance sheets big enough to write millions of loans on their own. So Wall Street originated and packaged the loans that common sense warned might very well have ended in collapse and foreclosure. **Some people might say Wall Street only helped to distribute risk. I believe Wall Street shifted risk away from people who knew what was going on onto the people who did not.** [source](http://www.vox.com/2015/11/12/9716034/hillary-clinton-nasdaq-speech)

No, the only real evidence I had to support my assertion were articles from major news organizations including the NY Times, The Washington Post, and Time among others (with titles such as [How Bernie Sanders Evolved on Gay Marriage](http://time.com/4089946/bernie-sanders-gay-marriage/) and [Bernie Sanders Claims He’s a Longtime Champion of Marriage Equality. It’s Just Not True.](http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2015/10/05/bernie_sanders_on_marriage_equality_he_s_no_longtime_champion.html)), articles that look at Senator Sanders' history and quotes on the matter. And the only reason I had to write a ""doctoral thesis"" on the matter was because you refused to admit that the assertion that Bernie Sanders supported same-sex marriage in the 1980s is ludicrous.

Okay, we're talking about four things here: supporting gay rights in general, supporting civil unions with full marriage benefits, supporting same-sex marriage, and opposing same-sex marriage.

* Both Senator Sanders and Secretary Clinton have supported many gay rights in general for quite a long time, Sanders since the 1980s as you pointed out, and Hillary Clinton [since the 1990s](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/clinton-white-house-gay-rights-hillary-clinton-staff-116859) and [during her time in the Senate](https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/senate-bill/1284?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22S.1284%22%5D%7D). Both of their records are somewhat mixed in this area. For example, in 1990, when asked by an interviewer if he would support a bill to protect gays from job discrimination, Sanders responded, “probably not,” [source](http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2015/10/05/bernie_sanders_on_marriage_equality_he_s_no_longtime_champion.html). But, again, they both have a longstanding strong record on gay rights overall, and I applaud Sanders' record in this regard.

* Hillary Clinton supported civil unions with full benefits since 1999, and Bernie Sanders supported them since 2000.

* In regards to supporting same-sex marriage, Bernie Sanders did so in 2009 and Hillary Clinton did so in 2013. Kudos to Sanders for supporting use of the word four years earlier than she did. I mean that completely seriously.

* In regards to *opposing* same-sex marriage, Hillary Clinton did so starting in 2000, when she said, ""Marriage has got historic, religious and moral content that goes back to the beginning of time, and I think a marriage is as a marriage has always been, between a man and a woman. But I also believe that people in committed gay marriages, as they believe them to be, should be given rights under the law that recognize and respect their relationship"" and ""I have supported the kind of rights and responsibilities that are being extended to gay couples in Vermont."" I never refuted this.

Bernie Sanders' position on the matter is murkier, largely because he avoided answering the question for years.

&gt; ...explanation of ""It hadn't come up in that context in an interview or statement with him before it did with her"".

On the contrary, it had come up in many interviews with Sanders starting from at least the year 2000, and he dodged the question ever time until 2006 (""Obtaining Congressman Bernie Sanders’ position on the gay marriage issue was like pulling teeth … from a rhinoceros""). And finally in 2006, he said that he opposed Vermont legalizing gay marriage in favor of civil unions:

As Slate wrote:
&gt; Sanders took a similarly cautious approach to same-sex marriage. In 2006, **he took a stand against same-sex marriage in Vermont**, stating that he instead endorsed civil unions. Sanders told the Associated Press that he was “comfortable” with civil unions, not full marriage equality.

And as the Huffington Post put it:
&gt; Sanders supported the eventual outcome, Vermont's inadequate civil unions law, **but not marriage**. Even in 2006, after he voted against George W. Bush's attempt to ban marriage in the Constitution, when asked if he supported legalizing marriage for gays in Vermont, Sanders said, ""Not right now, not after what we went through."" [source](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michelangelo-signorile/stop-straightsplaining-bernie-and-hillary_b_9218328.html)

&gt; But here's the rub. Bernie Sanders was NOT always a supporter of marriage equality for gay people. Mark Joseph Stern who covers Law and LGBT issues for Slate, is one of the few reporters to actually research Bernie's gay rights record and his report shows that, in fact, as recently as 2006 Bernie Sanders was arguing AGAINST marriage equality on a national level because he said that States should have the power to deny gay citizens the right marry. And even though Sanders also got a lot of media attention for his past stance of being one of the few against DOMA, there again if you look at his actual record he never expressed any desire for marriage equality for LGBT Citizens, rather he opposed DOMA because he felt it infringed on the powers of the State. [The Big Bernie Sanders Lie (That They Keep Telling)](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/wayne-anderson/the-big-bernie-sanders-li_b_9097284.html)

And Rachel Maddow confronted Bernie Sanders last year about this position he took in 2006:

As Wikipedia puts it:
&gt; In a 2006 debate, Sanders said he supported civil unions for homosexual couples as opposed to marriage. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Bernie_Sanders#LGBT_rights)

543,"So we're just looking for *correlation* now?! Wow.

Let's set some things straight. Yes, Bernie Sanders has a strong track record on gay rights (and certainly same-sex marriage is not the only gay right of importance). I never questioned that.

Yes, in 1983 he approved of a Gay Pride Day in Burlington, VT. I applaud him for that. However, I do not think this has anything to do with his stance on same-sex marriage (which was the specific issue I was originally addressing). Hillary Clinton has [pushed for gay rights](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/clinton-white-house-gay-rights-hillary-clinton-staff-116859) since the 1990s, but I'm not saying that she has supported same-sex marriage since the 90s. That would not be true.

You're correct, Bernie Sanders did oppose DOMA in 1996. I applaud him for that as well. So you could perhaps make the argument that Sanders opposed defining marriage as being between a man and woman in 1996, but that would be conjecture. It's possible that he felt that way, but he definitely did not say so at the time. The argument from the Sanders camp then was, ""that he opposed the law because it weakened the section of the Constitution that says states must respect laws that are made in other states. 'We’re not legislating values.'"" [source](http://time.com/4089946/bernie-sanders-gay-marriage/)

So, again, he certainly did NOT take any stance on same-sex marriage in the 1980s. And in 1996 he opposed DOMA on the grounds of protecting states' rights. But he *still hadn't publicly supported same-sex marriage*.

He supported civil unions in 2000 (as Clinton did in 1999), after Vermont passed such legislation. Legislation, I might add, that ""defined marriage as the union of a man and a woman."" [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_Vermont#Civil_union_legislation)

&gt; But [in 2000] the court also said that the Vermont legislature should decide the issue. Many prominent Democrats, including Sanders’ successor as mayor of Burlington and a gubernatorial nominee, spoke out in favor of gay marriage, but Sanders kept mum.

Freyne described repeated attempts to hear Sanders’ views on gay marriage, and the congressman only said he “supports the current process” in the state legislature.

&gt; “It’s an election year, yet despite the lack of a serious challenger, The Bern’s gut-level paranoia is acting up,” Freyne wrote. [source](http://time.com/4089946/bernie-sanders-gay-marriage/)

In 2006, he opposed a Constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman (as Clinton did in 2004, over state's rights issues). That same year, his response to whether Vermont should legalize same-sex marriage was ""Not right now,"" preferring to stick with civil unions. (I made the argument here that this could be considered *opposing* same-sex marriage. As you said in your previous post about Hillary, ""Even if she was only referring to protecting the word and giving them the rights some other way, it still leaves Bernie the one clearly more dedicated to supporting gay rights."" Hmm, opposition that is only referring to the word and giving them the rights some other way... arguing that it's a states' rights issue... sounds like [someone else's position at the time](http://www.timesargus.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060607/NEWS/606070302/1003/NEWS02?template=printart)...)

&gt; It wasn’t until 2009 that Sanders publicly voiced support for gay marriage, years after many of his contemporaries in Vermont. The state legislature voted to legalize gay marriage that March and overrode a gubernatorial veto to pass it into law in April. [source](http://time.com/4089946/bernie-sanders-gay-marriage/)

Oh boy, you're one to talk about twisting facts. Since when is approving of a Gay Pride Day as mayor the same as supporting same-sex marriage?

As every one of the articles I linked shows, Sanders did not support same-sex marriage until 2009. ""Period.""

&gt; The only document his campaign could provide showing Sanders’ support for gay marriage was an article that appeared on July 11, 2009, in the Valley News of West Lebanon, N.H. The article was mostly about the reversal by Vermont’s other senator, Patrick Leahy (D), on DOMA, but it also noted that Sanders had “previously voiced support for gay marriage laws passed this spring” in Vermont and New Hampshire.

&gt; The ""what we went through"" was a fight in the Virginia legislature to have legislation passed that legalized 'civil unions'. Which the New York Times called ""same-sex marriages in almost everything but the name"".

If that's your argument, then Hillary Clinton was ahead of Bernie Sanders because she [supported same-sex civil unions with full rights and privileges since 1999](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2013/03/18/how-hillary-clinton-evolved-on-gay-marriage/).

&gt; In October of 2000, Clinton made clear in response to a question from a gay voter that she did back civil unions -- implemented in Vermont that fall. ""I don't support gay marriages, but I do support extending benefits to couples, domestic partner benefits,"" she said, ""and the kind of civil union that Vermont adopted seems to be the way to create that opportunity for people.""

There are many who would argue that civil unions, however close in rights, are not the same as same-sex marriage for true equality.

&gt; In 2006, [when Bernie Sanders first ran for the Senate] and he was asked by a reporter whether Vermont should legalize same-sex marriage, he said no. “Not right now, not after what we went through,” he said. Sources (note the article titles): [How Bernie Sanders Evolved on Gay Marriage](http://time.com/4089946/bernie-sanders-gay-marriage/), [Sanders’s evolving and ‘wishy-washy’ stance on same-sex marriage](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/03/sanders-evolving-and-wishy-washy-stance-on-same-sex-marriage/), [As Gay Rights Ally, Bernie Sanders Wasn’t Always in Vanguard](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/28/us/politics/as-gay-rights-ally-bernie-sanders-wasnt-always-in-vanguard.html).

Sure, you could say it was because he wanted to avoid a bitter legislative fight, but the fact of the matter is he opposed Vermont legalizing same-sex marriage in 2006.

And in regards to Bush's proposed Constitutional amendment to define marriage as between a man and a woman, Hillary Clinton opposed it as well [in 2004](http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4578325/hillary-clinton-opposes-marriage-amendment):

&gt; ""We should not amend the Constitution to federalize an issue that has been the province of the States since our founding""

549,"I know, I was clear about which bill I was referring to. The point I made in my original post was that Bernie Sanders calls Hillary Clinton out for ""supporting regime change"" when one could make the argument that Bernie Sanders has also supported regime change in the past, in both Iraq and Libya, ""peaceful"" though he may have preferred it in the latter case. One could argue that his support for completely peaceful regime change in war-torn or otherwise precarious Middle Eastern countries is, perhaps, naive. But that's an argument for another day.

As for Libya, I agree with you that there is nuance to his position, but the bill he co-sponsored supported the UN Security Council's resolutions that ultimately [led directly to the intervention from a multi-state coalition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_military_intervention_in_Libya). There's also a big difference between invading Iraq in 2003 preemptively and essentially unilaterally (for the record, I *very much disapprove* of Hillary Clinton's vote on the Iraq War), and a multi-state UN-sanctioned mission to protect civilians in the midst of an ongoing civil war in Libya.

&gt; As for the bankruptcy bill, regardless of whether or not it passed in 2001, the bill overall was predatory. Making it slightly less predatory and using that as an excuse to support it, does not make that support any more justified.

You're certainly entitled to that opinion. I don't know if it's much different than Bernie Sanders voting for the 1994 crime bill (which created longer mandatory sentences, decreased the minimum age for minors to be tried as adults, and reclassified less serious crimes as felonies, which some point to as playing a key role in mass incarceration and racial inequality in our justice system), because there were aspects of the bill that he approved of.",2016-02-19 05:53:04+00:00,d05klkg,5.0,t1_d05iuv8,3660.0,politics

552,"You are correct that the reality is a bit more nuanced. And you're right it was a non-binding resolution, but as a cosponsor of the bill it still shows Senator Sanders' position on the matter. Moreover, here's the text from the 1998 Iraq Liberation Act that Sanders also voted for:
&gt; The Congress reaffirms that it should be the policy of the United States to support efforts to remove the regime headed by Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq and to promote the emergence of a democratic government to replace that regime.

I would argue that many of the arguments against Hillary have been either refuted, rebutted (certainly most of the points of the original ""The Hillary Clinton Record"" Reddit post could be), or at least given more background and nuance. But they keep popping up over and over again on r/politics. There's nothing wrong with having an opinion after looking at all the facts, but many people just remember the first impression they hear (""Hillary Clinton voted for the bankruptcy bill!""; ""Bernie Sanders voted for regime change!"") without looking into it further.

And I disagree with your assessment of the bankruptcy bill. For one thing, the version of the bill she voted on *never became law*. And secondly, the next version of the bill (without her changes) that came up for a vote, *the time it might have actually made a difference if she were indeed voting on it simply for Wall Street's interests*, **she did not vote for it** and [publicly opposed the bill](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2005/3/12/99007/-).

As *[Mother Jones](http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/02/just-how-cozy-hillary-clinton-wall-street)* put it:
&gt; This is classic Hillary. Once George Bush was president, she had no way of stopping the bill—so she worked hard behind the scenes to get what she could in return for her vote. Love it or hate it, this is the kind of pragmatic politics she practices. But there's no hypocrisy here; no change of heart thanks to Wall Street money (she supported the bill when it protected women and children and opposed it when it didn't); and no real support for the financial industry.

Whether or not one agree's with Elizabeth Warren's assessment that Clinton's amendment ""offers virtually no financial help to single mothers"" aside, Hillary Clinton has consistently expressed her largely negative feelings about the bankruptcy bill from the beginning. Her words from the Senate floor in 2001:
&gt; I rise today in support of final passage of S. 420, the Bankruptcy Reform Act.  Many of my colleagues may remember that I was a strong critic of the bill that passed out of the 106th Congress.

&gt; While we have yet to achieve the kind of bankruptcy reform I believe is possible, I have worked with a number of people to make improvements that bring us closer to our goals, particularly when it comes to child support. Women can now be assured that they can continue to collect child support payments after the child’s father has declared bankruptcy. The legislation makes child support the first priority during bankruptcy proceedings.

&gt; This year, we have made more progress. The Senate agreed to include a revised version of Senator Schumer’s amendment to ensure that any debts resulting from any act of violence, intimidation, or threat would be nondischargeable.

&gt; Earlier today, this body agreed to include a cap on the homestead exemption to ensure that wealthy debtors could not shield their wealth by purchasing a mansion in a state with no cap on homestead exemption.

&gt; In addition, I was concerned about competing nondischargeable debt so I worked hard with Senator Boxer to ensure that more credit card debt can be erased so that women who use their credit cards for food, clothing and medical expenses in the 90 days before bankruptcy do not have to litigate each and every one of these expenses for the first $750.

&gt; Let me be very clear—I will not vote for final passage of this bill if it comes back from conference if these kind of reforms are missing. I am voting for this legislation because it is a work in progress, and it is making progress towards reform.

Asked during a [debate in 2008](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/us/politics/the-vote-for-bankruptcy-reform-that-haunts-hillary-clinton.html) if she regretted voting for the measure, she responded, ""Sure, I do,"" adding, ""I was happy that it never became law.""

Hillary Clinton in 2015 [said](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/17/clinton-defends-bankruptcy-vote-from-senate-career-saying-biden-played-a-role/), ""When I got to the Senate, I wanted to see some changes so that alimony and child support would be protected, and so I negotiated those changes and then the people who had been handling the bill said, 'Well, if we take your changes, you have to support it,'"" Clinton said. ""That’s the way the Senate works.""

And all of Elizabeth Warren's comments on the matter, including the endnotes from her 2003 book you quoted, came before Hillary Clinton opposed the 2005 version of the bill. *[The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/02/09/elizabeth-warrens-critique-of-hillary-clintons-2001-bankruptcy-vote/)* had this to say:

&gt; One could suspect, as Warren did in 2003, that contributions made Clinton more sympathetic to the financial industry as a newly elected senator. But Clinton argues that she voted to advance the bill — ""held my nose"" — as part of an agreement to make the bill better. Warren says the main provision touted by Clinton was only a fig leaf, but we have no idea of how Clinton might have voted on final passage in 2001 because the bill did not come up for a final vote that legislative session.

&gt; In the end, however, Clinton was against the bankruptcy bill at the moment it really counted — final passage in Congress. (In all, 26 Democrats opposed the bill and 18 supported it, along with all 55 Republicans.)

&gt; So for all the money the financial interests contributed to Clinton’s campaign, she did not give them the support they desired. At the same time, however, the vote was so lopsided that Clinton’s support was not needed.

&gt; In light of subsequent events, Warren’s comments from 2004 at this point appear out of date. We would be curious to know if Warren’s experience as senator has changed her perspective on Clinton’s actions in 2001.",2016-02-19 04:13:24+00:00,d05hl51,3.0,t1_d055q2y,18074.0,politics

[PART TWO]

*Lies/Misinformation*

* Sen. Sanders’ healthcare plan originally assumed $324 billion per year in prescription drugs savings, when the current amount spent nationally is only $305 billion. When confronted about this, they [revised the savings estimate down to $241 billion](http://www.vox.com/2016/1/28/10858644/bernie-sanders-kenneth-thorpe-single-payer). They also revised down the assumed administrative savings from 16 percent to 13 percent and the savings on utilization up from $216 billion to a whopping $660 billion. Professor of Health Policy at Emory University and architect of Vermont’s single-payer proposal Kenneth Thorpe said, “""They are just throwing things against the wall to see what sticks.” Independent, nonpartisan analysts estimate his healthcare plan is underfunded by anywhere from $1 trillion to [$3 trillion](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-health_us_56b25e8fe4b04f9b57d83008) over the first 10 years.

* Sen. Sanders’ campaign ad entitled “Endorsement” [explicitly stated that the Valley News endorsed him](http://www.politifact.com/new-hampshire/statements/2016/feb/04/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-ad-claims-endorsements-valley-news-/), and implied that the Nashua Telegraph did the same, [when they had not](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/04/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-mistaken-about-whether-his-campaign/). [Sanders did the same in Iowa](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bernie-sanders-is-no-revolutionary/2016/02/08/19a15618-cea3-11e5-88cd-753e80cd29ad_story.html), running a nearly identical ad — “He’s been endorsed for real change,” the narrator said — that left the strong and wrong impression the Des Moines Register was among those endorsing him. The paper had endorsed Hillary Clinton. Both ads end with “I’m Bernie Sanders, and I approved this message.”

* In Iowa, Sen. Sanders sent out campaign mailers that included the logos of the League of Conservation Voters and AARP, even though AARP [does not endorse and the League of Conservation Voters endorsed Clinton](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bernie-sanders-is-no-revolutionary/2016/02/08/19a15618-cea3-11e5-88cd-753e80cd29ad_story.html). Sanders campaign staffers [misrepresented themselves as Culinary Union members](http://www.newsweek.com/sanders-complaints-iowa-nevada-420806), wearing union pins, so they could gain access to employee dining rooms on the Las Vegas Strip and campaign for Sanders. The union, which had made no endorsement, said it was “offended” by the multiple instances of “falsifying.” And the nonpartisan American Legion gave Sanders a [cease and desist in regards to using the organization's emblem](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/sanders-asked-drop-american-legion-emblem-campaign-36784763) in campaign fliers.

* Sen. Sanders said that his campaign did not “go out and take” information from the Clinton campaign off of the DNC system. It is true that the Sanders campaign did not attempt to break into the voter data of a rival campaign – they stumbled upon a glitch. [But rather than reporting the glitch immediately, they probed the database for a bit under two hours](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/22/bernie-s/Sanders-take-Clinton-voter-data/). Experts familiar with the Democratic voter database say that the Sanders campaign would have gleaned valuable information.

Sanders [called for President Obama to face a primary opponent](http://thinkprogress.org/special/2011/07/22/277124/bernie-sanders-primary-obama/) in 2012, then later claimed to have “campaigned very hard” for Obama then and that “the idea that I worked against President Obama is untrue.” Obama’s aides [remember things differently](http://www.buzzfeed.com/evanmcsan/the-obama-campaign-remembers-2012-very-differently-from-bern#.kyOPE0a7p): Sanders was ""either attacking the president from the left or doing little to get him elected.""



*Questionable Judgment*

* Sen. Sanders has a good record working for Veterans, but he was also Chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee during the [V.A. Health Administration scandal of 2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterans_Health_Administration_scandal_of_2014). He initially chalked up mounting complaints of months-long wait times that led to dozens of deaths, to the Koch brothers and other conservatives wanting to dismantle the Veterans Affairs Dept.
&gt;“There is, right now, as we speak, a concerted effort to undermine the V.A. You have folks out there now — Koch brothers and others — who want to radically change the nature of society, and either make major cuts in all of these institutions, or maybe do away with them entirely.,” said Mr. Sanders.
Ultimately, reports surfaced of secret waiting lists to hide long delays in care, and at least 40 veterans died waiting for appointments [source](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/us/politics/faith-in-agency-clouded-bernie-sanderss-va-response.html?_r=1). As the New York Times put it, “his deep-seated faith in the fundamental goodness of government blinded him, at least at first, to a dangerous breakdown in the one corner of it he was supposed to police.”
&gt; ”For far too long he was apologizing for the VA. He was refusing to acknowledge the severity. He was positioning it as a smaller issue than it was while veterans were dying waiting for care,"" [Paul Rieckhoff, founder of the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, told CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/14/politics/bernie-sanders-va/).

* Sen. Sanders claimed that [“Any Supreme Court nominee of mine will make overturning Citizens United one of their first decisions,”](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/01/22/bernie_sanders_tweet_to_overturn_citizens_united_misunderstands_the_supreme.html) when in fact the limits on justices’ ability to set their own schedule are laid out in [Article III of the Constitution](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii).

* The people that have worked closest with Sen. Sanders, and should perhaps know him best, in the House and Senate are [by and large not endorsing him](http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/bernie-sanders-colleagues-arent-feeling-bern-n427596) in his presidential bid. Despite serving in the Senate for 9 years, and before that in the House for 16 years, he has received no endorsements from a sitting Senator, none from a sitting Governor, and [only two from sitting Congressmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bernie_Sanders_presidential_campaign_endorsements,_2016#U.S._Senators); in contrast, 158 congressmen and -women have endorsed Sec. Clinton. 12 out of 18 sitting Democratic Governors have endorsed her. [39 out of the 46 Democrats in the Senate endorsed Hillary Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Hillary_Clinton_presidential_campaign_endorsements,_2016#U.S._Senators), none have Mr. Sanders. Clinton even has [the backing of Vermont’s senior Senator, Democrat Patrick Leahy, and Governor Peter Shumlin](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/30/bernie-sanders-lacking-congressional-endorsements/74883526/).


Again, as stated above, believe it or not, *I’m actually not anti-Sanders*. I like Bernie Sanders and agree with him on many issues. If he wins the primary, I will vote for him. But I also can recognize that he’s an imperfect human being and, yes, at the end of the day, a politician. Hell, I’m happy that he has changed position on certain issues in light of new information, especially with regards to gay marriage and gun manufacturer/seller immunity. And I’m well aware that there are many explanations, caveats, and different ways of looking at these issues that show more context and nuance for his positions. That was kind of the point of this post.

I mainly put this list together to show that this kind of thing can be done for any politician, even one with as squeaky clean an image as Senator Sanders. I find that many Sanders supporters (and sometimes Bernie himself) like to portray him as having perfect judgment all his life without ever changing his mind, when the facts simply don’t bear that out. And that’s fine! But just own up to it so we can move forward with a more serious discussion.

568,"**The Bernie Sanders Record**
[PART ONE]

So, in response to [“The Hillary Clinton Record”](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/43crex/the_hillary_clinton_record_updated/) posted by /u/MellowArtichoke and responded to by /u/TheRealRockNRolla, /u/Vellai and others, as well as many posts on r/politics like this one, I decided it might be a helpful exercise to put together a similar list covering Bernie Sanders’ record.

*Changes in Position/Inconsistencies*

* Sen. Sanders changed positions on [immunity for gun manufacturers and sellers](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/17/hillary-clinton/fact-checking-gun-manufacturer-liability-bernie/), [voting in favor of it in 2003 and 2005](http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/16/politics/bernie-sanders-gun-vote-2005/), but now opposing it.

* Sen. Sanders changed his position on gay marriage. In 2006, Sanders' answer to whether Vermont should legalize gay marriage was, ""No,"" telling the Associated Press that he was “comfortable” with civil unions, [not full marriage equality](http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2015/10/05/bernie_sanders_on_marriage_equality_he_s_no_longtime_champion.html). [In 2009, Sanders publicly spoke out in favor of gay marriage for the first time](http://time.com/4089946/bernie-sanders-gay-marriage/).

* Sen. Sanders claims “[I’m not evolving when it comes to gay rights.](http://time.com/4089946/bernie-sanders-gay-marriage/) I was there!” But when serving as mayor of Burlington in 1990, Sanders told an interviewer that LGBT rights were not a “major priority” for him. Asked if he would support a bill to protect gays from job discrimination, Sanders responded, “probably not” [source](http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2015/10/05/bernie_sanders_on_marriage_equality_he_s_no_longtime_champion.html).

* Sen. Sanders decries Wall Street deregulation, but [voted for the Commodities Futures Modernization Act in 2000](http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/17/politics/bernie-sanders-wall-street-deregulation-debate/), which [many point to](http://www.businessinsider.com/bubble-derivatives-otc-2010-5) as a [key cause](http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1869041_1869040_1869098,00.html) of the [2008 financial crisis](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123509667125829243) and [Great Recession](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323623304579059070153371410).

* Sen. Sanders [voted against the 2007 immigration reform bill](http://time.com/4170591/bernie-sanders-immigration-conservatives/), but is now [in favor of a path to citizenship](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/bernie-sanders-and-immigration-its-complicated-119190). According to the NY Times, “His language at the time often related not to the concerns of the workers receiving the visas, but to the bill’s impact on American wage-earners.” [source](http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/10/19/bernie-sanders-cant-escape-questions-about-2007-vote-on-immigration-overhaul/?_r=0). But he now claims he did so to protect immigrants from slavery-like working conditions.

* Sen. Sanders calls for reforming our criminal justice system, but voted in favor of the controversial [1994 crime bill](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/02/12/1994-crime-bill-haunts-clinton-and-sanders-as-criminal-justice-reform-rises-to-top-in-democratic-contest/), which created longer mandatory sentences, decreased the minimum age for minors to be tried as adults, and reclassified less serious crimes as felonies, which some point to as playing a key role in mass incarceration and racial inequality in our justice system. He has spoken out against mandatory minimum sentencing but voted for it in that law as well as the [Minimum Sentences for Gun Crimes bill in 1998](http://thefederalist.com/2015/11/03/bernie-sanders-voted-for-criminal-justice-measures-hes-denouncing/).

* Sen. Sanders campaigns against wasteful military spending, yet has [championed the basing of eighteen of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighters](http://www.newsweek.com/2015/10/02/bernie-sanders-campaigns-2016-presidential-campaign-democratic-party-374897.html) – a $1.5 trillion program that yielded the most expensive aircraft in history – in Burlington, VT.

* Bernie Sanders has regularly hosted Democratic Party fundraiser retreats in Martha’s Vineyard and Palm Beach, and [accepted over $200,000 in funding](http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/05/politics/sanders-democratic-fundraisers/) ($37,300 directly, $60,000 for Sanders ads, and $110,000 for the Vermont Democratic Party) from the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee for his 2006 campaign for the Senate. Nearly 10% of those funds came from Wall Street donors, including Goldman Sachs. He also received $10,000 from [HILLPAC, Hillary Clinton's Political Action Committee](http://www.foxnews.com/story/2006/04/21/sen-clinton-gives-10000-to-dem-candidates-in-march.html) [at least $7,500 directly from lobbyists with ties to the financial industry](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/bernie-sanders-regular-luxurious-dscc-fundraising-retreats), including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Visa, as well some energy companies like the American Petroleum Institute. Sanders has yet to release the transcripts of his remarks at these fundraising events.
&gt; ”At each of the events all the senators speak. And I don't recall him ever giving a speech attacking us,"" the donor said. ""While progressive, his remarks were always in the mainstream of what you hear from senators.""

* Sen. Sanders [cosponsored a Senate resolution in favor of regime change in Libya](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/22/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-bernie-sanders-voted-get-rid-/) and UN Security Council action to implement it, but now opposes it. He also voted for [regime change in Iraq in 1998](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_Liberation_Act), but was against the Iraq War in 2002, and now claims to oppose regime change.
&gt; Text from the 1998 legislation: ""It should be the policy of the United States to support efforts to remove the regime headed by Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq and to promote the emergence of a democratic government to replace that regime.""

* Sen. Sanders called for Iranian troops on the ground in Syria, then later claimed [he never called for that](http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/22/politics/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-flip-flops/).

* Sen. Sanders is against the use of nuclear energy, claiming that “the toxic waste byproducts of nuclear plants are not worth the risks of the technology’s benefit.” [source](http://economics21.org/commentary/bernie-sanders-nuclear-power-climate-change-preston-cooper-12-10-15). But he also [voted for a compact that allowed Vermont and Maine to dump nuclear waste](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/sep/22/fact-checking-viral-graphic-critical-bernie-sander/) at a designated site near the majority-Latino community of Sierra Blanca, TX.

* Sen. Sanders rails against loss of privacy, but spoke in favor of tech companies aiding the government in breaking encryption, while arguing that it’s somehow possible to do so without violating privacy rights:
&gt; “What we have got to do there is among other things, as I was just saying, have Silicon Valley help us to make sure that information being transmitted through the Internet or in other ways by ISIS is in fact discovered. But I do believe we can do that without violating the constitutional and privacy rights of the American people.” - Bernie Sanders, 2016. [source](http://www.whatthefolly.com/2016/01/26/nbc-news-democratic-presidential-debate-transcript-bernie-sanderss-remarks-on-lone-wolf-homegrown-terrorism/)

* Sen. Sanders changed his mind about being in the [Democratic Party](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/19/bernie-sanderss-flip-flop-on-the-democratic-party-and-what-it-says/) and the importance of a third party candidacy, officially joining the Democratic Party in November 2015 when it was most convenient for him.
&gt; In 1988, Bernie Sanders lamented Jesse Jackson’s choice to run as a Democrat: “My own preference would have been, and I would have rather have seen, Jesse Jackson run independently, third-party, outside of the Democratic Party. Essentially, it's my view that the leadership of the Democratic Party and the Republican Party are tied to big-money interests and that neither of these parties will ever represent the people in this country that are demanding the real changes that have to take place.”


And this is just after a cursory look at his record. Imagine what more may come up as Sen. Sanders receives more and more national scrutiny.

Believe it or not, **I’m actually not anti-Sanders**. I like Bernie Sanders and agree with him on many issues. If he wins the primary, I will vote for him. But I also can recognize that he’s an imperfect human being and, yes, at the end of the day, a politician.

&gt; “It wasn’t so much punishing as rewarding, and I really think that’s an important point,” said one source familiar with Bill’s thinking. “It wasn’t so much, ‘We’re going to get you.’ It was, ‘We’re going to help our friends.’”

&gt; “I wouldn’t, of course, call it an enemies list,” said one Clintonworld source when asked about the spreadsheet put together by Balderston and Elrod. “I don’t want to make her sound like Nixon in a pantsuit.” 
Another one of Hillary’s longtime advisers sought to diminish the long-term relevance of the naughty-and-nice records kept by Band. “I’m sure Doug does have some sort of fucking memo on his Blackberry like the rest of us,” the adviser said. “But the notion that it is updated, circulated, disseminated and relied upon is absurd.”

588,"&gt; However, it seems somewhat disingenuous to use the term when she knows that a single-payer system is what is inferred from the comment. Since the single-payer system was part of Obamacare in the early stages, and has been used a lot by Bernie Sanders when discussing his universal healthcare.

This is simply not true. First of all, Obama never, ever attempted a Single Payer system with Obamacare.

&gt; ""For us to transition completely from an employer-based system of private insurance to a single-payer system could be hugely disruptive, and my attitude has been that we should be able to find a way to create a uniquely American solution to this problem that controls costs but preserves the innovation that is introduced in part with a free-market system."" – [Obama, 2009](http://pnhp.org/blog/2009/07/02/nhis-numbers-and-building-on-what-works/)

He tried to include a [public option](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act#Senate), but that couldn't get a supermajority in the Senate even among Democrats. The public option would have added another component to the bill involving government-sponsored healthcare, but it's still a *far* cry from Single Payer.

Secondly, as I said before, Single Payer is [not the only form of universal healthcare](http://www.forbes.com/sites/danmunro/2013/12/08/universal-coverage-is-not-single-payer-healthcare/#689b271447f5), and saying ""universal healthcare"" does not automatically mean ""Single Payer."" Many of the countries with the [highest ranked universal healthcare systems](http://thepatientfactor.com/canadian-health-care-information/world-health-organizations-ranking-of-the-worlds-health-systems/) have mixed public and private systems, and much of the top ten are not Single Payer. Several of them achieve universal healthcare by way of an insurance mandate, not too different from the ACA.

Hillary Clinton has been [fighting for universal healthcare since 1993](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_health_care_plan_of_1993), and her proposals at the time were considered radical socialism and shot down, but never involved a Single Payer system. Arguing that she can't use the term ""universal healthcare"" because Sanders' plan for achieving the same goal involves a Medicare-for-all Single Payer system is ludicrous.

&gt; I think it is very disingenuous to imply that providing insurance for the last 10% will change anything 90% of the nation experiences.

This point is unrelated to the larger one about universal healthcare, but improving care and reducing costs for the 90% of people already insured is something that she has addressed over and over in debates, speeches, and in her [health care platform](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/health-care/):

594,"I think you bring up an interesting point, but I just don't understand this Reddit narrative that Sanders has always supported every gay rights issue and Hillary Clinton never did until recently. I've posted about this before, but it bears repeating.

Sanders has a good record on gay rights, but it's incorrect to insinuate that he hasn't ""evolved"" on some issues therein, including gay marriage. Yes, in 1983 as mayor he allowed a Gay Pride Day, and I've got to give Sanders credit for voting against DOMA. Though Sanders and his wife at the time explained that his reasoning was, ""that he opposed the law because it weakened the section of the Constitution that says states must respect laws that are made in other states. 'We’re not legislating values.'""

But as recently as 2006, Sanders' answer to whether Vermont should legalize gay marriage was, ""No."" It wasn't until 2000 that Sanders supported civil unions for gays, and [it wasn't until 2009 that he spoke out in favor of gay marriage](http://time.com/4089946/bernie-sanders-gay-marriage/).

Hillary Clinton also has a long history of supporting gay rights, and doing so when it wasn't politically convenient. And gay marriage is the most recent, but certainly not the only, issue when it comes to gay rights. Many people look back at Don't Ask Don't Tell as a negative (and certainly today’s full acceptance of gays in the armed forces is much better), but in the early 1990s that was actually a win against outright banning gays in the military.

The Clintons were the first administration [to invite gay rights activists to the White House back in 1993](http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-04-16/news/1993106115_1_gay-and-lesbian-white-house-gay-leaders). And Hillary and her staff in the Clinton administration were instrumental in furthering and protecting gay rights. ""The records released by the National Archives at the Clinton Library here Thursday demonstrate that Hillary Clinton’s staff took a progressive stand on other gay-rights issues and helped push to torpedo anti-gay-rights legislation."" She and her staff in the Clinton administration ""pushed for government-wide vetting of an executive order to ban federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation.""

Beyond that, I do think there are sincere people who believe, ""We don't trust Hillary, but that has nothing to do with her gender."" I think that it's a byproduct of 25 years of nearly completely unsubstantiated attacks on her from the right (here are [the greatest hits](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/all-the-terrible-things-hillary-clinton-has-done-in-one-big-list-2016-02-04)), all the way up to the Benghazi investigations (which [Congress spent more time on than the 9/11 probe](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/01/democrats-benghazi-panel-217402) and the email issue (which was approved by the State Dept. and is [in line with what the two previous S.O.S.'s did during their tenure](http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/04/politics/hillary-clinton-email-classified-colin-powell-condoleezza-rice/)).

601,"&gt; Here is one of those pressures: Hillary Clinton absolutely cannot express negative emotion in public. If she speaks loudly or gets angry or cries, she risks being seen as bitchy, crazy, dangerous. (When she raised her voice during the 2013 Benghazi Senate committee hearings, the cover of the New York Post blared “NO WONDER BILL’S AFRAID.”) But if Hillary avoids emotions—if she speaks strictly in calm, logical, detached terms—then she is cold, robotic, calculating.

&gt; You’d think the solution might be to put on a happy face, to admit to emotions only when they are positive. But it turns out that people hate it when Hillary Clinton smiles or laughs in public. Hillary Clinton’s laugh gets played in attack ads; it has routinely been called “a cackle” (like a witch, right? Because she’s old, and female, like a witch); frozen stills of Hillary laughing are routinely used to make her look “crazy” in conservative media.

&gt; She can’t be sad or angry, she can’t be happy or amused, and she can’t refrain from expressing any of those emotions. There is no way out of this one. There is no right way for her to act.

609,"I would assert that one of the, if not the main, goals of the ACA was to decrease the number of uninsured Americans, and it has certainly done so. In 2010, the year it passed, the uninsured rate was over 15% according to the [CDC's National Health Interview Survey](http://www.forbes.com/sites/dandiamond/2015/08/12/for-first-time-americas-uninsured-rate-is-below-10/#752a5c94741c) (it's been as high as 18% in past years). In 2015, that number fell to below 10% (9.2%, to be specific).

In terms of affordability, while some have seen rises in premiums (mostly in states with fewer insurance companies/less competition, and ones that turned down federal funding to expand Medicaid), most people have seen lower costs due to subsidies according to the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/10/27/us/is-the-affordable-care-act-working.html?_r=0#affordability).
&gt;Eighty-five percent of those who signed up during the enrollment period qualified for federal subsidies to help pay premiums. For those who qualified for subsidies through the federal exchange, the subsidies lowered the cost by 76 percent on average, according to the Obama administration.

A recent [Commonwealth Fund study](http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/press-releases/2015/jan/biennial-health-insurance-survey) found that in 2014 (the first year the ACA exchanges were in effect), fewer Americans had problems paying medical bills or medical debt, and fewer went without care because they couldn’t afford it. This is the first decline and lowest level in these areas since 2005.

In fact, if one were to look at the trend in health premium growth, just looking at the fact that premiums rise each year does not give the full picture. Health premium growth [slowed to its lowest rate ever recorded in 2013 &amp; 2014](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/12/03/us-health-spending-grows-at-lowest-rate/19830573/) and has continued to be low (4.2%) through [2015](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/09/22/new-data-show-slow-health-care-cost-growth-continuing). A decade ago, most plans were seeing [double-digit increases](http://kff.org/health-costs/report/2014-employer-health-benefits-survey/).
&gt;Employer-sponsored health insurance premiums grew more slowly in 31 states and the District of Columbia between 2010 and 2013 -- after the passage of Obamacare -- compared with 2003 to 2010, according to the nonpartisan foundation the Commonwealth Fund.
–[CBS News](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/study-premium-growth-slowed-after-obamacare/)

Additionally, the ACA has found many areas to cut medical costs with new efficiencies and more effective treatment methods, with the ACOs generating a [combined $417 million in savings for Medicare](https://www.cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/Fact-sheets/2014-Fact-sheets-items/2014-11-10.html). The law also requires insurers to spend [80-85% of premium dollars on actual healthcare](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/FR-2011-12-07/2011-31289/content-detail.html), rather than administrative costs or profit.
&gt;Health-care providers receive financial rewards for cutting costs and penalties for bad care, such as when patients have to be readmitted to hospital after they have been discharged or when they catch nasty infections in a clinic. Between January 2012 and December 2013 there have been 150,000 fewer readmissions among Medicare patients—an 8% decline. The law also requires greater price transparency.
&gt;Overall the CBO projects that, if the law is unchanged, net federal spending for the government’s main health-care programmes in 2039 will be 8% of GDP, about 15% less than had been projected in 2010. Projections for Medicare and Medicaid spending between 2011-2020 have been revised downwards by $1.1 trillion. The government also claims that since 2011 some 50,000 fewer patients died in hospitals as a result of Obamacare. Far from bankrupting the nation, as its critics predicted, Obamacare may be making medicine thriftier.
–[The Economist](http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21645855-growth-americas-health-care-spending-slowing-will-obamacare-cut-costs)

This combined with the fact that the ACA [prohibits insurers from denying coverage for people with pre-existing conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act#Overview_of_provisions) and [prohibits insurers from charging more for insurance based on gender](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/the_aca_helps_women.pdf), all while maintaining a minimum quality standard for coverage.

In terms of constitutionality, that point I suppose is debatable, though the ACA has been challenged all the way to the Supreme Court [over](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Federation_of_Independent_Business_v._Sebelius) and [over](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burwell_v._Hobby_Lobby_Stores,_Inc.) and [over](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_v._Burwell). Its constitutionality was upheld and the law has largely and fundamentally remained intact. [The Court](http://www.americanbar.org/newsletter/publications/aba_health_esource_home/aba_health_law_esource_0712_howell.html) upheld the individual mandate under the taxing authority given to Congress under the Constitution.

It's far from a perfect law (when has any law of this size and scope ever been?), but I would call it a qualified success at its goals of lowering the number of uninsured, increasing access to quality healthcare, reducing healthcare costs, and yes, on the whole keeping healthcare premiums affordable and helping to slow the rate of premium increases to 50-year lows.

She was an instrumental member of the Clinton administration in the 1990s (and certainly one of the most accomplished first ladies in history), fighting for universal healthcare, speaking out about women's rights in China, helping to create the Children's Health Insurance Program, the Adoption and Safe Families Act, the Foster Care Independence Act, and the Office on Violence Against Women at the DOJ ([Source](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/09/carly-fiorina-debate-hillary-clintons-greatest-accomplishment-213157)).

As a Senator, she fought for and won 9/11 first responders care, expanded health care access for members of the National Guard and reservists, authored the Pediatric Research Equity Act, and championed the Lilly Ledbetter Pay Equity Act. She served on the Committees on Armed Services; Budget; Environment and Public Works; Health, Education, Labor and Pensions; and a Special Committee on Aging.

Her Senate voting record matches Senator Sanders' 93% of the time. She is and [always has been a progressive](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/hillary-clinton-was-liberal-hillary-clinton-is-liberal/), but one who is politically pragmatic and willing to reach across the aisle.

As Secretary of State, she repaired U.S. relations with many countries around the world, helped secure the START treaty ratification with Russia, negotiated a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, played a role in the killing of Osama Bin Laden, and laid the groundwork which ultimately led to both the normalization with Cuba and the Iran nuclear deal. Her foreign policy experience is unmatched by any candidate on either side of the aisle.

I think the policies she has put forward as a candidate, from Wall Street reform, to the expansion of healthcare coverage, implementation of cleaner energy solutions, and methods to raise middle class incomes are great steps in the right direction and have a realistic chance of actually happening. I think she has a proven track record as a champion for progressive causes of both learning from her mistakes and getting things done.

632,"Yes Sanders has a good record on gay rights, but it's incorrect to insinuate that he hasn't evolved (some might even say ""flip flopped"") on some issues therein, including gay marriage. Yes, in 1983 as mayor he allowed a Gay Pride Day, and I've got to give Sanders credit for voting against DOMA. (Though it was hardly something that Bill Clinton, let alone Hillary, had much control over: it was passed with enough votes in Congress to override a presidential veto). In fact, Sanders and his wife at the time explained that his reasoning was, ""that he opposed the law because it weakened the section of the Constitution that says states must respect laws that are made in other states. 'We’re not legislating values.'""

But as recently as 2006, Sanders' answer to whether Vermont should legalize gay marriage was, ""No."" 

It wasn't until 2000 that Sanders supported civil unions for gays, and it wasn't until 2009 that he spoke out in favor of gay marriage. (http://time.com/4089946/bernie-sanders-gay-marriage/)

Hillary Clinton expressed support for civil unions as early as 1999, and publicly supported gay marriage in 2013. (http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/17/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-change-position-same-sex-marriage/)

I would argue that Hillary Clinton also has a long history of supporting gay rights, and doing so when it wasn't politically convenient. And gay marriage is the most recent, but certainly not the only, issue when it comes to gay rights.

Many people look back at Don't Ask Don't Tell as a negative (and certainly today’s full acceptance of gays in the armed forces is much better), but in the early 1990s that was actually a win against outright banning gays in the military.

The Clintons were the first administration to invite gay rights activists to the White House back in 1993 (http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-04-16/news/1993106115_1_gay-and-lesbian-white-house-gay-leaders).

""The records released by the National Archives at the Clinton Library here Thursday demonstrate that Hillary Clinton’s staff took a progressive stand on other gay-rights issues and helped push to torpedo anti-gay-rights legislation."" She and her staff in the Clinton administration ""pushed for government-wide vetting of an executive order to ban federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation.""

""Other memos made public this week at the Clinton Library show aides to Hillary Clinton worked to defeat an effort spearheaded by Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) to prevent unmarried couples from adopting children in Washington, D.C."" (http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/clinton-white-house-gay-rights-hillary-clinton-staff-116859)

In 2011, She lobbied for the first-ever U.N. Human Rights Council resolution on human rights and in an address to the UN said that ""Gay rights are human rights."" (https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/post/clintons-geneva-accord-gay-rights-are-human-rights/2011/03/04/gIQAPUipcO_blog.html)

So, I think it’s disingenuous to say that Sanders hasn’t changed his position on the matter. And I think that Hillary Clinton shares a similarly longstanding record to Sanders in support of many gay rights issues.

636,"The coin flips were for COUNTY delegates, which are a mere fraction (about 1/10th) of a state delegate. If Sanders won all of the coin tosses (he did win several other coin tosses himself; there were at least a dozen reported), it would be about a 0.6 point swing.

“On caucus night, Iowans in each precinct elect delegates to their county conventions, but the winner of the caucuses will be the candidate who accrues the most state delegate equivalents. State delegate equivalents are calculated using a ratio of state to county convention delegates. In other words, the ratio determines how many delegates the candidate would receive for the state convention based on the number of county convention delegates a candidate receives.” (http://iowademocrats.org/about-iowa-caucuses/)

There are 11,065 county delegates (http://www.npr.org/2016/01/30/464960979/how-do-the-iowa-caucuses-work) which get translated into 1,406 state delegates (http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/how-do-the-iowa-caucuses-work). That works out to around 1 county delegate = 0.127 state delegate equivalent.

""As a result of the coin toss, Clinton was awarded an additional delegate, meaning she took five of the precinct’s eight, while Sanders received three. Similar situations played out at various precincts across the state, but had an extremely small effect on the overall outcome, in which Clinton won 49.9 percent of statewide delegate equivalents, while Sanders won 49.5 percent. The delegates that were decided by coin flips were delegates to the party's county conventions, of which there are thousands selected across the state from 1,681 separate precincts. They were not the statewide delegate equivalents that are reported in the final results.""

""Senator Clinton: I rise today in support of final passage of S. 420, the Bankruptcy Reform Act.  Many of my colleagues may remember that I was a strong critic of the bill that passed out of the 106th Congress.
While we have yet to achieve the kind of bankruptcy reform I believe is possible, I have worked with a number of people to make improvements that bring us closer to our goals, particularly when it comes to child support. Women can now be assured that they can continue to collect child support payments after the child’s father has declared bankruptcy. The legislation makes child support the first priority during bankruptcy proceedings.
This year, we have made more progress. The Senate agreed to include a revised version of Senator Schumer’s amendment to ensure that any debts resulting from any act of violence, intimidation, or threat would be nondischargeable.
Earlier today, this body agreed to include a cap on the homestead exemption to ensure that wealthy debtors could not shield their wealth by purchasing a mansion in a state with no cap on homestead exemption.
In addition, I was concerned about competing nondischargeable debt so I worked hard with Senator Boxer to ensure that more credit card debt can be erased so that women who use their credit cards for food, clothing and medical expenses in the 90 days before bankruptcy do not have to litigate each and every one of these expenses for the first $750.
Let me be very clear—I will not vote for final passage of this bill if it comes back from conference if these kind of reforms are missing. I am voting for this legislation because it is a work in progress, and it is making progress towards reform.""

639,"There's a big difference between ""I should be president because I have a vagina"" and answering a debate question about what makes her different from Obama by saying that she's a woman. I think it's a legitimate point, albeit one she could have expanded upon a bit more, because of the difference in perspective that that can offer in certain areas. And I think that was her turning what has unfortunately long been a political liability (being a woman) into an asset. Sadly in 2016, some still act like women (51% of the population) are a minority.

At other points in the debate and throughout her campaign she has pointed to her experience, judgment and record again and again, so it's reductionist to the extreme to imply that she really believes, or ever even said, people should vote for her solely on the basis of her gender.

EDIT: I guess I shouldn't be surprised by the downvotes. Here are Hillary's own words on the matter:

She doesn’t have an inch of leeway, a single safe option; there is no version of Hillary Clinton that won’t be attacked. So the version of Hillary Clinton we get—this conflicted, conflict-inspiring candidate, the woman who has a genius-level recall of global politics but has to assure the world she’ll spend her presidency picking out flowers and china, the lady who books a guest spot on Broad City but can’t pronounce “Beyoncé,” the woman who was decades ahead of the curve on women’s rights but somehow thinks it’s a good idea to throw in a Bush-esque 9/11 reference at a debate—is the inevitable product of these pressures.",2016-01-30 19:01:31+00:00,czhsd1x,1.0,t3_43dweu,23421.0,PoliticalDiscussion

669,"&gt;It’s an ancient (meaning dating back to the Classic era) Mac convention that in a read-only scrolling view, you can use the space bar to page down. When your eyes get to the bottom of the display, you can just hit space and the view should scroll to show the next screen full of content — with the last line or two of the previous screen now repeated at the top of the new screen to provide context as your eyes move from the bottom to the top of the display. This works almost everywhere on OS X, and anywhere it doesn’t work should be considered a bug.

&gt;On iOS 9.1, Safari tries to support this, but it is dreadfully buggy. Instead of paging down just less than one screen-height of content, it pages down about 1.5 screen-heights of content. It literally scrolls right past huge amounts of content, rendering the feature completely unusable.

&gt;Here’s a sample page I’ve created to illustrate (http://daringfireball.net/misc/test/1000.text). It’s just a simple text file with 1,000 lines, numbered in order. When I view that on my MacBook Pro, I see lines 1–45 (and half of line 46). When I hit space to page, the view scrolls and I now see lines 44–89. Hit space again and the view scrolls to show lines 88–132.

&gt;On iPad Pro, I see lines 1–49 initially. But when I hit space to page down, the view scrolls to show me lines 75–123. Lines 50–74 are completely skipped past. It’s not even just a line or two — it’s huge chunks of text. This happens in all web pages in Safari on iOS 9.1, and it is not specific to the iPad Pro and Smart Keyboard. I see the exact same behavior on any iPad with a paired Bluetooth keyboard.

And 6 of the 12 deadliest shootings in the United States happened since 2007 (though this list is, sadly, already out of date): http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/nation/deadliest-us-shootings/

Many of the guns acquired in recent mass shootings were purchased legally, some of which may have been prevented by a more thorough background check system that actually maintains people's complete criminal and mental health records. ""At least eight gunmen had criminal histories or documented mental health problems that did not prevent them from obtaining their weapons.""
http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/10/03/us/how-mass-shooters-got-their-guns.html

And studies show that even small delays/barriers for criminals can reduce crime dramatically. ""The central insight of the modern study of criminal violence is that all crime—even the horrific violent crimes of assault and rape—is at some level opportunistic. Building a low annoying wall against them is almost as effective as building a high impenetrable one... What the New York Police Department found out, through empirical experience and better organization, was that making crime even a little bit harder made it much, much rarer.""

This is mostly mitigated by very fast internal SSDs, and I've edited off of my MBP's SSDs several times without problems. If you do get an external drive, USB 3 should be the minimum and of course a Thunderbolt RAID or SSD are ideal.

Also, H.264 is not really an editing format, it's a delivery format. It's very CPU-intensive to playback and edit H.264 on-the-fly, but again I do it all the time in FCPX without many issues. One thing you can do to try to improve playback performance is click the little lightswitch by the Viewer and change it to Better Performance from Better Quality. If that's not enough, you can (as others have suggested) transcode your media to ProRes or ProRes Proxy.

When transitioning from the (originally OS 9-era, deprecated-Quicktime-based) Final Cut Pro classic to modern 64-bit code, Apple made the controversial decision to use it as an opportunity to re-think the NLE model. But because it's essentially a new app, it fully takes advantage of modern hardware, as it's 64-bit (uses all your RAM), OpenCL GPU-accelerated (uses your graphics card for playback, render and export), and supports Grand Central Dispatch (uses all of your CPUs and cores). And, of course, since Apple makes the hardware and software, they can tune them both to each other for maximum performance. Adobe has made strides in improving the performance of their applications, notably with Premiere's Mercury Playback Engine, but it still doesn't compare to what Apple has achieved with FCPX.

702,"&gt; So... without apple and its single-digit marketshare not offering floppies, hundreds of millions of non-apple users never would have stopped using floppies and switched to USB?

I'm sure it would have happened eventually, but I'm saying Apple may have helped speed up the process a bit. The iMac G3, while a small percentage of total computer sales, sold quite well at the time. And it made a big splash in the industry, which no doubt caused other OEMs (and accessory makers) to take notice.

Hell, Apple today has, what, six percent marketshare these days, and look at how laptop designs changed after the MacBook Air's release. Or were black keyboards on silver, tapered bodies inevitable?

&gt; DVI has been around and has been commonly used since it's creation in 1999.

Define ""commonly used"", because I haven't seen it. Anecdotal I suppose, but every PC user I know (many of whom are tech-savvy, some of which are computer engineers) have had VGA ports in all of their machines, even some relatively recently purchased ones. My Macs have had DVI, Displayport or Thunderbolt (modern, non-analog ports) for well over a decade, and I've been using a 2560x1600 display since 2005.

And to address part of your other comment:
&gt; Removing usb ports and disc drives from Macbooks and iMacs in the name of 'good design' is completely asinine though. You're putting aesthetics over functionality that many users still need.

Removing the optical drive in laptops was hardly ""form over function"", it's a tradeoff. Maybe you don't agree with it, but there are certainly benefits to be had. When they removed optical drives, MacBooks became thinner, lighter and got an enormous increase in battery life all at the same time. With the concurrent switch to SSDs, most moving parts were removed from laptops, something that helps in terms of speed, battery life, and the likelihood of damaging parts. All of that is very worth it to me.",2015-12-29 06:14:59+00:00,cyepkcg,4.0,t1_cyed01w,22077.0,apple

716,"&gt; you can try and divert as much as you want, but the facts are sanders stood up for hillary, hillary didnt do the same for sanders

No doubt it was very big of Sanders to move on from Hillary's email scandal in the first debate. Good on him. It reflects very well on his character.

Firstly, I'd say these are two very different situations. This issue with Bernie's National Data Director accessing data from the Clinton campaign (even if his motives were as pure as claimed) is something that *directly affects* Hillary and her campaign. Bernie himself admitted that what happened was wrong, fired Uretsky, later suspended two more staffers involved, and rightfully apologized to Hillary Clinton – and his own supporters – on stage.

Secondly, Hillary could have easily pounced on this at the debate, but she chose not to. I'd argue that in this way she did ""do the same for Sanders."" Let's compare what she said in this last debate to what Sanders said in the first:

&gt; ""I very much appreciate that comment Bernie. It is very important that we go forward on this. Now that I think we've resolved your data we've agreed on an independent inquiry we should move on because I don't think the American people are interested in this. I think they're more interested in what we have to say on all these issues."" –Hillary Clinton, 3rd Democratic Debate

Also, there are many applications in which a tablet/touchscreen form factor is better than a laptop, including as an illustration/drafting tool (works great on a drafting desk with the Apple Pencil), as a replacement for paper &amp; a clipboard on a worksite, as a learning tool especially for younger children, as a chart/manuals replacement for airplane pilots, or as healthcare tools for doctors, to name a few. And they're getting better and better at the traditional ""work"" stuff such as Microsoft Office (the version that runs on the iPad is arguably better than the one for Mac).

There were many tradeoffs when going from a desktop form factor to a laptop form factor, but in the end the pluses outweighed the minuses for many, many people. Of course desktop computers are still around for those that need them, but the trend has clearly been moving to laptops for years.

&gt; The voting system doesn't solve the problem: Someone ahead reports, ""Hey, there's an accident!"" Someone else, farther upstream in the traffic, sees that accident report and gives it a thumbs up because they also perceive that ""bad traffic must mean there's an accident."" Indeed, confirmation bias would suggest that trailing vehicles are more likely to perceive that there was an accident even if they never see one.

But even with that sharp decline, that doesn't change the fact that our current **overall** murder rate is still much, much higher than other advanced countries (we're just below Iran, and just above Uzbekistan): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate

And the fact that our gun-related homicides are several times higher than other advanced countries: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate

&gt; Overall murder is down 50% over 20 years despite record rates of gun ownership. This is a fact.

No, the second part of your sentence is *not* a fact. Studies actually show that **gun ownership is down**, even though gun sales have gone up (fewer people own more and more guns).

Petty's publisher contacted Smith's team after it noticed a likeness between ""Stay with Me"" and the melody of Petty's 1989 song ""I Won't Back Down"". According to Smith, he had never heard ""I Won't Back Down"" before he wrote ""Stay with Me"",[10] but he acknowledged the similarity after listening to the song, and said that the likeness was ""a complete coincidence"".[11][12] Petty and Lynne however were not eligible for a Grammy as the Recording Academy considered ""Stay with Me"" to have been interpolated from ""I Won't Back Down"" by Napier, Phillips and Smith; instead Petty and Lynne would be given certificates to honor their participation in the work, as is usual for writers of sampled or interpolated work.

Robertson v. Baldwin found that the 2nd Amendment doesn't cover concealed weapons:
&gt;""The law is perfectly well settled that the first ten amendments to the Constitution, commonly known as the ""Bill of Rights,"" were not intended to lay down any novel principles of government, but simply to embody certain guaranties and immunities which we had inherited from our English ancestors, and which had, from time immemorial, been subject to certain well recognized exceptions arising from the necessities of the case. In incorporating these principles into the fundamental law, there was no intention of disregarding the exceptions, which continued to be recognized as if they had been formally expressed. Thus, the freedom of speech and of the press (Art. I) does not permit the publication of libels, blasphemous or indecent articles, or other publications injurious to public morals or private reputation; the right of the people to keep and bear arms (Art. II) is not infringed by laws prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons.""

United States v. Miller found that sawed-off shotguns (an *individually operated weapon*) are not covered by the 2nd Amendment:
&gt;""In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a 'shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length' at this time has some reasonable relationship to any preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument. Certainly it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.""
&gt;&gt;1997 SCOTUS: ""In *Miller*, we determined that the Second Amendment did not guarantee a citizen's right to possess a sawed off shotgun because that weapon had not been shown to be 'ordinary military equipment' that could 'contribute to the common defense.'""
&gt;&gt;2008 SCOTUS: ""*Miller* stands only for the proposition that the Second Amendment right, whatever its nature, extends only to certain types of weapons.""

Even in the District of Columbia v. Heller, a landmark decision that upheld the 2nd Amendment, the court found that there are limits:
&gt;""Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose: For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues. The Court’s opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. *Miller's* holding that the sorts of weapons protected are those 'in common use at the time' finds support in the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons.""

Firstly, I think the app itself is much better; the design is clearer, the animations smoother, and the layout and way it works just makes more sense to me than Google's. Beyond that, the directions have been spot on for me, the traffic information is very accurate and up-to-date in my experience, and the POIs are getting better and better all the time. I love the Yelp integration (much prefer it to Google Places), the Siri integration is extremely useful (""where's the best sushi around here?"", ""take me home"", etc.) and the lock screen maps are great (and save some battery life). (Night mode is also great, but I think Google Maps finally has that now). I've had both Apple Maps and Google Maps take me to a no-longer-open location before, so neither are perfect.

I know everyone on Reddit loves Google Maps, but clearly the silent majority on iOS are using Apple Maps (it gets 3.5x more use than the ""next most used mapping app""). Google has some nice features that Apple's doesn't, like street view, biking directions, and toll avoidance, but I don't use any of those much to be honest. And I find the turn-by-turn voice directions Google gives to be far too *wordy*, to the point of being annoying.

While Google Maps is a great resource, I'm reluctant to share my location with Google.

FCP7 captured a key part of the NLE market for sure, but it was built on a very old technical foundation that desperately needed to be updated.",2015-08-04 06:14:23+00:00,ctqu461,4.0,t1_ctqrjar,6424.0,apple

Anyway, I'm not exactly sure what the problem is. Just type in what you want the export to be called, and it should remember it the next time you export the same Project.",2015-08-03 16:15:26+00:00,ctq0g0g,1.0,t3_3fmkm4,4024.0,editors

The only thing I'd add to this is to embrace the magnetic timeline, don't fight it. It's basically just designed to ripple by default (but that can be overridden, of course, with things like the Position tool).
