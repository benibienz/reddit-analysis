0,"Ouch, yeah I've noticed the female character problem for a while now. I had no idea about why Aki got so heavily sidelined (if that story is true it's amazing) and it really pisses me off because up until then she was the beast female duelist we've had. Largely why I don't watch 5DS beyond the dark signer arc is because of how she got shafted.

It's the same with Asuka, I was really looking forward to seeing her in Arc-V, and what we did get was great, but to only get two duels, one against hired goons (hired goons?) and one in which she gets toyed with (which admittedly really endeared Yuri to me) really sold the character short.

And yeah the way Yuzu (and to a lesser extent Serena) has been treated (being turned into a damsel and literal plot object) is nothing short of insulting. I don't usually harp on about the way female characters are presented in anime but when you have your best female character reduced in the way that she was it's hard to argue that there isn't a problem. I certainly can't see the male characters being turned into Dr McRapes parasite puppets (at least outside of a doujinshi)

I know it will probably never happen but I'm holding out for Yu-gi-oh eventually having a female lead, if only to prove it can be done.",2016-11-22 06:47:30+00:00,daap149,,t1_daahm9d,12933.0,yugioh

And even if you subscribe to the notion that any practices can be considered 'inherently evil', simply performing them does not make you evil. Theft, murder and the like could all easily be considered evil but pretty much every Shadowrunner alive would disagree with you if you were to call them evil for doing so, at least to some extent.

Zombie Megumi was no more physically capable than the other zombies, and Kurumi was physically the most capable to deal with her, but the character's connection made Kurumi hesitate, whereas the bookish Miku was able to calmly deal with her because she didn't have that connection.

If it were me I'd use this as an oppourtunity to remind the players where they are on the food-chain. I'm not saying flat out destroy them but make the repercussions for this severe and long lasting. When players start thinking they can get away with something like this it can create problems in the future because they'll keep doing it. Best to cut of the arm and keep the infection from spreading.
