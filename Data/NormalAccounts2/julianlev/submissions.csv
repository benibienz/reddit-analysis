This can apply to most of the characters but with Sombra I think its the worst its ever been. Unlike Reaper and Widowmaker, who are treated as being fairly cold-blooded, Sombra is presented as someone we're supposed to find fun and quirky with her laid back demeanor and her 'boops', but in the same scene we see her gun down human guards without so much as a second thought.

As I said this isn't the first time I've noticed this; Hanzo put an arrow through the heart of a sentient robot (though I suppose that's supposed to be more okay by the law of Samurai Jack) and 76 blew up at least one guy with his missiles, but again with Sombra it really feels like it clashes with how she's presented as a person. I'm not saying you can't have someone who kills with a smile but generally such characters are found in stories with much darker tones overall while Overwatch has always been quite cheery and upbeat.

Its especially noticeable since, due to her nature as a hacker, they could have easily had the animation without her straight up killing people.

The reasons are numerous (more interesting setting, greater character customization, etc) but there are two big ones. 

Firstly, Shadowrun is all about moral relatives where D&amp;D was all about absolutes. Good and Evil were actual qualities applied wholesale to sentient races in D&amp;D and telling if someone was 'evil' was as easy as casting a detect alignment spell on them. Maybe I've just gotten cynical since then but these days I have real trouble engaging with a world with such a simplistic take on complex issues of morality. Shadowrun, by comparison, is all about finding those grey areas  which lends itself to far more interesting characters and stories. That said, I understand why the simplified moral system of D&amp;D is useful, in that it aids in the power fantasy by granting an iron clad justification for the characters actions. ""Who cares why so-and-so is trying to destroy the world, he's evil and that's all the reason I need. Screw court of law I'll just lop of his head and then back to the tavern for wine and cheeses!"" I realize this is a generalization but that is the kind of attitude that a world like D&amp;D encourages with its simplified moral system. Simply put, D&amp;D is about overcoming adversity and ascending to greatness and that's made all the easier when all the corpses your stepping on are of the unquestionably evil variety. Again, I'm not saying that is objectively bad, just that it doesn't really work for me anymore.

This also leads me to my second point. As I said D&amp;D is all about growing exponentially in power to overcome greater and greater threats. By the end of an average campaign a simple warrior will end up as being literally as strong as a giant, while a wizard can make reality dance on a string. This is my other reason for liking Shadowrun more. When a character attains the power to rival the gods themselves the world itself starts to lose weight because literally every challenge can be overcome, and the characters stop feeling like real people because it is our limits and what we cannot do that plays as great a role in making us who we are as what we can do. I always hated playing high level D&amp;D campaigns because something as simple and character building as measuring rations for a trek into the wilderness started to seem pointless, in fact in most cases it is pointless (see: everlasting rations). Magic was always the worst offender here, too powerful, to easy to acquire and with pretty much no inherent disadvantages. Drawing upon the weightless world analogy, when everyone in the party is loaded up with magic items and half of it can cast spells as easily as lifting a finger magic becomes pretty boring pretty fast. I could go on but you get my point. Shadowrun, by comparison, is much less about conquering everything in front of you and more about just making it from one encounter to the next, and no matter how powerful you get there will always be forces that you can't hope to beat. You'll pretty much never topple a megacorp in Shadowrun because that's not what the game is about (and the lack of that binary moral system makes that fact a lot easier to deal with). Again I realize there are variations in style (trenchcoat vs mohawk) but generally there is a limit to what Shadowrunners are capable of and that makes them a lot easier to identify with as people.

With all this said I'm interested in how you guys treat morality and character limits in your games. On morality do you like maintaining some moral absolutes and presenting some forces (Aztec) as purely bad and other as purely good, or do you keep things grey and let the characters work through it themselves? And on limits, what limits do you set for your characters, are their efforts limited to small blips on the radar of a single sprawl or do you let them rise to greater power and influence?

And if you do that how do you encourage the formation of the team itself (short of having a character say ""hey, people who I know nothing about, would like to form a criminal mercenary team with me"").

On a related matter, in the Shadowrun universe how do teams recruit new members when they lose someone, and how do aspiring Shadowrunners find a team to join. ",Shadowrun,Getting the team together,https://www.reddit.com/r/Shadowrun/comments/4yogts/getting_the_team_together/

It had great atmosphere, memorable characters and a wonderfully unique blend of saccharine and disturbing that I hadn't seen in an anime since I watched Higurashi several years ago.

However I have since learned that apparently the story of School Live! does not end at the point where the anime does and is in fact still ongoing. I'm told we even get a hint that the anime will eventually move into that territory by a character who shows up at the end of the final episode.

Now on one hand I really did like this story and normally I'd be stoked to see another story in the same world. However it seems as though the story will still follow the original group as they run into another survivor group who are apparently no where near as charming as the original.

Here are my concerns. 

First, much of the uniqueness behind School Live! was it's juxtaposition of silly, high school shenanigans with horrifying zombie epidemic. Now that the girls have left the school I'm not sure they can keep that going and I'm worried that it will become all serious all the time. 

Second, Yuki's growth as a character from someone lost in a willful delusion to accepting of reality was another key aspect of the story, and without regressing her (or rehashing her arc with another character) I don't see how they could recapture that wonderful creepiness that she gave off, or provide an emotional climax as brilliant as she had when she finally let go of Megumi.

Third, the introduction of a new, less likable group of survivors as antagonists is something that really worries me, because it happens in a lot of stories like these and not only is it somewhat predictable but the new characters are often portrayed as simply one-dimensional villains who distract us from the far more interesting threat of the zombies. I'm fine with the whole 'extreme situations can turn people into the real monsters' bit (in fact I really like that angle) but then I'd rather it be a character who I've known and have come to like so that I can see what drives them down such a dark path, rather than just introducing new characters who are assholes from the start.  

Finally, I'm kind of worried where this will eventually lead if the story does just keep going, that they'll start to go deeper into the cause of the epidemic and find some grand, malevolent force/conspiracy behind everything. This would be awful in my opinion because it runs the risk of completely derailing what the show is supposed to be about, which is the characters, their interactions and how they live in a new and terrifying world. I was worried enough in the first season that this would happen when they discover the underground bunker and the emergency evacuation manual but thankfully  it was left relatively vague. We don't need a reason for the zombies for the story to work, we only need them to be there. In fact I'd argue it's much better if we never learn what caused them. For anyone whose watched it this was a problem I had with Higurashi in its second season, when it stopped being about interesting characters and horrifying, inexplicable incidents and became more of a general adventure story with the heroes taking on a nebulous, evil entity. It was still good, but once you start explaining everything a story like this loses much of the mystery that gives it an allure.  

Believe me I want to be proven wrong here, and much of my worry comes from the fact that the first season ended so satisfactorily for me without any loose ends (or at least ones that I cared about). The girls grow as characters, they escape the school and venture into the world by each others sides. I worry that continuing the story will only lead to diminishing returns.

If anyone can give me some advice or reassurance (without any major spoilers) I'd appreciate it because I really do like this show and I want to be excited for another season if we get it.",GakkouGurashi,Concerns over potential Second Season for anime.,https://www.reddit.com/r/GakkouGurashi/comments/4yjt3p/concerns_over_potential_second_season_for_anime/

It has therefore been quite disheartening to see how they've been used in most modern works. Simply put, most modern takes on Zombies focus way too much on presenting them as a purely 'physical' threat. This has led to the upsurge in more physically capable 'fast' zombies because most people realize these days that, as predators, traditional zombies leave a lot to be desired. They even remove the rotted, 'from the grave' look for a cleaner (and again more physically intimidating) aesthetic

But this, to my mind, is missing the whole point. What makes zombies scary isn't how physically dangerous they are (lions are dangerous but you don't see many horror films about them) but what they represent, namely death, its consequences (losing who we are, wasting away into nothing and being forgotten) and how it eventually happens to all of us, even those around us who we care about.

It pleases me to no end that School Live! gets this. Its zombies aren't that physically imposing when not in large numbers, but they don't need to be. They aren't faceless hordes without any identity, they're school goers, people the characters would have known as people. And of course the most terrifying one is the person they all knew well and were close to (It speaks volumes that a character who at one point charges into a horde swinging away with abandon actually runs and hides from this one particular zombie).Because of this the zombies don't actually need to kill any of the cast to have a profound effect on them as they do that simply by being zombies.

School Live! is a great anime for many reasons (its characters, story-telling and use of symbolism) but it is how it understands zombies and the meaning behind them, at least in my opinion, that really makes it worth watching for horror fans.",GakkouGurashi,School Live!

Compare this to other depictions in the books (or in the Shadowrun Returns games) where such characters seem less ""monstrous"" for lack of a better word. Compare the troll woman on pg 100 of SR5 to the character of Eiger from Shadowrun: Dragonfall. One could probably pass for a tall human woman with a little effort while no amount of troll reduction surgery is going to help the other.

This disparity in portrayals of metahumans is fascinating to me and I wonder what motivates it. Are the different depictions tied to  the tone of the game (trenchcoat vs mohawk) or has there been a gradual development from less to more 'normal' looking as the franchise has evolved.

I like the idea of a character whose outlook on life is affected by a single traumatic event as it provides a nice central element for everything else to grow around (like Batman). So here's my idea; its quite heavily inspired by the Sinking Ship incident from Shadowrun: Hong Kong. During his earlier years my character was a gang member in a densely populated sprawl that was divided between his gang and one other rival group. During an assault upon the rival gang's HQ their leader (a mage) went toxic and summoned a horde of malformed creatures that went wild and swept through the neighborhood, killing and devouring not only most of the gang members on both sides but also a large number of civilians. Needless to say, surviving this left an impact on my character.

I'm making a new character who was raised corporate and joined Knight Errant as a combat mage before unfortunate events led to his departure.

Due to his background I want him to have knowledge skills focused on law enforcement, security and corporate policing. The problem is that I'm not sure which kind of knowledge skills these fall under. Core lists security companies (like Knight Errant) as Street Knowledge, but I'm more interested in a professional knowledge of how Errant operates. But Errant doesn't appear under Police Procedures (which I would have assumed they would) only Ares which I'm imagining is more for standard corporate guards or Firewatch.

I've also been having a hard time determining what Errant are exactly in relation to Ares. At first I thought that they were just created by the Ares head but were otherwise separate, but now I'm wondering if they're meant to operate directly under Ares authorization. 

Finally, can anyone give me some idea as to what Errant combat gear looks like, all I've got to go on are the yellow and black outfits from Shadowrun Returns.

Any help would be appreciated.",Shadowrun,Knight Errant General Knowledge and Knowledge Skills,https://www.reddit.com/r/Shadowrun/comments/4rpugy/knight_errant_general_knowledge_and_knowledge/

I would love to play a character who skulks around the outskirts of battle throwing out attacks that reduce enemy damage output or movement speed. My personal favourite idea is an attack that drains enemy health and adds it to your own, because then I could role-play as Shang-Tsung.

So I hit upon the idea of creating a Spirit based upon the mythological ferryman Charon who carries the dead to the underworld.

While I've been able to come up with a neat disadvantage for the spirit (player must pass a Charisma + Willpower test to take an item from the dead, ie looting a corpse, grave-robbing etc) I've been struggling to come up with decent advantages for him. Given the mythology something based around resisting death might be nice, but that seems like it could easily end up as too powerful.

Are there any bosses that you would have liked to have seen cutscenes for?
