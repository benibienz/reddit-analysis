3,"Really sorry for replying late, procrastination got the better of me. Thanks a lot for being precise, I'll definitely try to follow the path that you've enrolled yourself into. I know only so much of HTML/CSS just to build a responsive static site, not anything beyond that. So, it'd be beneficial for me to pick up JScript and AngularJS in near future. Continue publishing more apps in the playstore, you have a long way to go. One thing I must appreciate, I'm particularly fascinated by the design of the app. I've seen people building Andriod Apps for the first time and they look plain bland. Good job on that!
And btw, I'm studying Computer Science (in my 2nd year) and we have Data Strutures and Algorithms in our syllabus. While I'm nowhere near mastering them, I have a fairly basic understanding. So if you need any kind of assistance, I'd be happy to help!",2015-09-25 18:22:58+00:00,cve0glv,3,t1_cv5ra17,627550,learnprogramming
4,"It's awesome! Especially for a debut project to be published.
I've been learning Java for the past couple of weeks and would delve into android very very soon. It'd be great if you clarify how the framework is different from building an app in Java. And as far as I know, AngularJS is used to build web-apps, isn't it? Would love to know about your learning path too!",2015-09-18 06:29:22+00:00,cv5m7zv,1,t3_3ldzz7,10593,learnprogramming
