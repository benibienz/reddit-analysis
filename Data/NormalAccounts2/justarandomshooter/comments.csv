45,"Adding to DLAB advice:

Don't put a hell of a lot of stock in your score.  It's usually used to slot people intro CAT 3 or 4 languages, but there are plenty of exceptions driven by quota availability in each language schoolhouse and each unit.  Sometimes above 95s wind up in Spanish or Persian, some below wind up in Chinese, Russian or whatever.

As a predictor of academic success the DLAB is basically worthless.  People on score waivers grad with honors, and PLENTY of people with scores over 120 are undesignated within months.  Having rock solid study habits,and the discipline to apply them for months counts a lot more.  Avoiding all the A school shit show shenanigans that lead people astray is also hugely helpful.

The DLAB is also a poor indicator of ease of language acquisition.  The hardest language taught to English speakers is generally recognized as Hongul.  The easiest to teach is normally Spanish, but it is by a wide, WIDE margin the hardest basic language course at DLI.  The pace and volume are what kills in Spanish.  Most languages introduce 20-30 new vocab words a day. Spanish force feeds 100-125. You stub your toe in that course and you will probably never catch up.

Some people also just click to a language.  They pick it up easy and never have to study at all to excel.  Nobody likes them.  The odds of you being that person are lower than you DLI marriage outlasting your first PCS tour though, so you're probably fine.  Most people spend three to four hours working language on top of six hours of actual class, at least for the first half of the 12-15 month courses.

The indoor range is good to go as well.  The staff all knows me and that I reload.  I'm a very conscientious member and shooter, which generates a lot of good will. If they see me gathering brass when I'm shooting semi auto, the RSOs will sweep others lanes' brass over to me.

122,"&gt; Do you support the maintaining and expansion of social welfare programs?

Yes.  Helping each those in need is intrinsic to our identity as Americans.  Further, the old images of welfare queens pumping out kids is an old, tired myth that has been long debunked.  Ditto rampant drug use among social assistance recipients.  Mandatory drug testing for welfare recipients has repeatedly shown that the actual rates of drug use are in single digits, and the testing programs are largely a waste of money.

&gt; Do you support the LGBT community? 

I support people, and they are people, so yes.  

&gt; Do you stand for environmentalism? 

Absolutely.

&gt; Are you in favor of reproductive rights? 

Yes.

&gt; Do you oppose the ongoing military interventions in the Middle East? 

As a 24 year veteran who invaded two countries and fought in three wars, yes I do.

&gt; Is health care a human right that should be free of charge? 

The bigger question to me is whether health care in the US should be so heavily monetized from an insurance standpoint.  I do not think it should be.  

&gt; Should recreational drugs be decriminalized? 

Some of them, yes.  Most definitely marijuana.  The War on Drugs has been an abject failure with disastrous consequences that dwarf Prohibition.  Considering that John Ehrlichman went on record as saying that Nixon used it as a tool to criminalize civil rights and youth movements, the entire thing is suspect at BEST.  It's responsible for the private prison industry, has crippled generations socially, gave us mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines and has blighted entire urban centers.

&gt; Do you support Black Lives Matter?

I think that the militarization of police forces in the country is the bigger problem a the moment, which is not to say that systemic racism hasn't been a real thing.  I agree with the principle that black lives matter (note lower case) but think that BLM as an organization are largely assholes.",2016-09-21 13:47:56+00:00,d7vzcd6,1.0,t3_53ru1x,27354.0,liberalgunowners

CPO DRB/PRD happens ALL THE TIME.  A lot of my commands handled it after hours, which was a real joy.  Shit ran to 2100 after a full day.

Anyway, yes.  Yes it does happen. In MY experience, CPO DRB is a panel composed entirely of MCPOs.  Some examples off the top of my head, and results:

- AGC sexually harrassing the bujeezus out of female subordinates. Bad, cringe worthy, tacky shit.  Oneof his Sailors approached the CMEO after one of a series of special presentations to every department in the command about....wait...another sexual harassment case.  I got to work, logged in and got a call from the CMC.  Go get the 40 DH, then go get Chief Ballsack and relieve him as LCPO.  Justification is coming now.  Send him to my office, tell him DRB is at 1800.  You're chairing.  His retirement request was faxed in that night and approved at Millington effective 30 days hence the next morning.  TIL there really ARE surprise retirements.

- AOC fomenting sedition at a training command..  Shit you not.  Busted hard one grade by the ISICs' ISIC.  Via conference call on speaker.  Sent to CCU and summarily separated at 16.

- SCPO for frat and adultery.  Had chaired Induction Season while banging an Ensign (Upper Half) behind his wife's back the entire time.  The wife was also a Chief at the same command.  She pulled their cell phone records, compared to their watch skeds and produced a FINE piece of analytical correlation post-event reconstruction.  Texts included. He was over 20 and also got insta-retired.

- Not a Chief, but once when I Was sitting in for the CMC while he was ata selection board I stood in for him at a Captain's Mast for a STA21 ensign.  Sexual harassment of Seamen Deuces and what not in X div. Found guilty, Letter of Reprimand, SECNAVFIND required.  Kicked right the hell out after being busted back to E-5 via Flag Officer Space Magic and put on restriction.

- Chief came back from a three week boat run with dolphins.  Qual book, certificate and all that shit.  The CO sent a P4 to the slipper to thank him for helping out CPO Sack-o-donuts, to which the boat CO inquired ""pardonme but what the fuck are you talking about?""  Turns out the guy had access to the YNC's computer and forged all that shit to make 8.  Busted to E-6 and wore it around for several months before slinking off.

- Chief that did just about everything I can think of.  Bad checks, smacking girlfriends around, per diem fraud, govt CC fraud, and sitI can't even remember.  One little thing went wrong with a travel claim and all of it came crashing down.  Nobody had any clue how it had gone on for so long.  He was frocked, so reduction rate (NOT suspended) to PO2.  Then got a DUI...WHILE ON RESTRICTION and since it was his second, had base driving privileges revoked for five years.  He lost his clearance pronto and had to get the duty driver to take him to his job bussing tables at the club on base in an honestly spiteful effort to make him pay back tens of thousands of dollars in travel claim fraud.

278,"Yeah I've been playing grens almost exclusively since I unlocked them.  Currently level 57/HQ22, so I'm pretty familiar with their behavior.

Grens don't *need* to get close to any short range defenses, but they can if you flare them there intentionally.  The reason you might do this is that grens' biggest weakness, inaccuracy its ensuing widely distributed damage patter, is also their biggest strength.

On an NPC base with a lot short range defense shoreside, say Shocking Solution or Drastic Destruction for instance, you're either forced to land proximal to flamers of MGs or your preferred attacked pattern calls for it.  The biggest advantage to grens is that although they take a long time to damage medium range targets, they deal a huge amount of damage in a fan pattern beyond them.  This allows longer range targets to be almost or completely reduced while you play the delta between relative engagement distances.  Imagine using the short range, low damage defenses up front functioning as stalking horses.

There are some bases where grens are not well suited.  Pierced and True Love come to mind.  There are others on which they are so well suited that they can destroy the HQ without the defenses ever firing.  Elbow Room and Target are good examples.  

I get that most people play a mix of troops, or several different loadouts depending on the base.  I just like grens.  At first I was drawn to them for the range, then I really got into them because they allow battles to take some time. I personally prefer attacks to go 3:59 if possible (some hyperbole there, admittedly) rather than being over quickly.  I also like to engage as many of the defenses as possible rather than bypassing them.",2016-07-29 18:00:36+00:00,d5w6h42,5.0,t1_d5w2cbu,5243.0,BoomBeach

A-Team allure was also a factor if I'm being honest.

This is the third or fourth one I bought in a quest to get a mini I could put a scope on because nobody was doing that back then and I'm a fucking trendsetter.  I sold or traded the others at gun shows because they wouldn't hold zero with optics on account of the shitastic mount situation back in the day.

Finally got one with machined in places for the grippy bits on rings, and then found the best Simmons 3-9x40 that $100 would buy.  Slapped that fucker on and I was good.

340,"GREAT idea.

Full disclosure I'm a CFer, multiply certified CF coach, retired military, former military/non-profit CF Affiliate owner.  

All that being said, this is fantastic from a standpoint of exposing competitive shooting (and of course shooting in general) to a huge array of competitive individuals across many demographics who almost unanimously have decent disposable income.  Members in CF gyms come from a vast array of backgrounds, beliefs and lifestyles with the sole common thread being functional fitness.  Kind of like the shooting community in that regard.

From a competitive standpoint, its a great way to test precision performance under high physical stress for time and accuracy in measurable, controlled and repeatable conditions.  We used to run stressfire courses similar to this in the Nav.  They covered a few miles broken up into quarter mile or so chunks of load bearing runs, punctuated by various tests and tasks.  Run/jog/shuffle (depending on the stage) 500 yards with a 35lb ruck, then do a memory box, then 250 yards and a rope climb, then a few hundred and field strip an M4, etc.  Shooting at a stage or two.  Great way to train to shift quickly from physical duress to fine motor skills immediately.

I get where you're coming from about CFHQ possibly caving, /u/peanutbuttergoodness, but in my experience with the organization going back over 8 years, Greg Glassman leans heavily to the side of telling detractors to go fuck themselves.  Love him or hate him, and the rest of the high priests of CF, the org as a whole tends to do whatever they want.

361,"In order to attend the Basic Airborne Course you need to be on orders, and you need to be in a PJ coded billet.  The billet coding is the hard part because that involves special pays, EPMAC determination, the CO and probably the ISIC are involved.  

You cannot show up on leave or permissive TAD orders, the Joes will turn you completely away.  People been trying that for decades.

If you found yourself in the right set of orders, say JCU or some other command in the SOCOM arena, then it would be easy.  Those are typically special programs that you have to screen for apply to, get accepted into and make it through the training pipeline for.  Then it would just be a C-school en route or you'd go on a returnable quota in your tour depending on seat availability.

Why do you want a lead sled anyway?  It's a big deal int he army, but it's the 5 Jump Chump pin in the Nav.  In any case, jump school BLOWS.  Its not a matter of difficulty (it aint hard), its just the most boring, dumbed down, formation intensive and fucking awful experience a Sailor can imagine.  

Classes are 400 deep on day one.  Day one is consumed by human paperwork.  The cadre gets all 400 jackasses on a grinder and formates everyone depending on their paperwork.  Over. And. Over.  300 of those classmates will have graduated infantry boot camp on the other side of the base the previous Friday.  

Benning is the home of the infantry, by the way.  You probably think you've met dumb people.  You haven't met dumb people until you've met someone who hasn't yet rocked out of BAC due to academics.  It happens.  The course is so fucking simple that, I shit you not, writing skills are not used.  You don't need so much as a pencil.  And people rock out.

Week one is ground week, which mainly involves a lot of formations, then marching somewhere, all 400 of you.  Then you stand in formation until you get a lecture and practice some skill.  That skill will likely involve learning how to fall down.  Then you formate again, march back to the barracks and formate until you get released.  To field day.

Week two is tower week, which isn't terrible once you get to the towers.  You and the other 300 jackasses formate, march somewhere, get lecture on whatever the device is, then formate and wait.  Zip lines and shit.  You get to do each one a few times, interspersed with several hours of formation waiting.  

Week three is jump week.  All 200 of you will formate, wait, then march to the hangars.  You get all done up in your gear, checked numerous times by Joes gong through jumpmaster school, and you fucking wait.  And. Wait.  You never saw anyone as antsy as 200 Joes waiting to get on a plane and jump.  People will barf and piss out of nerves.  They'll start touching shit, and then you all get re-inspected again and wait some more.

FINALLY you get on a plane and jump out.  Someone will try to chicken out.  They get booted right out of the door.  You go out, because the last thing you want to do is break weak, do your five count, and the chute opens.  That shit HURTS.  Look up, marvel that the fucking thing actually worked and then have about ten seconds before that ground gets really close.  Remember all that falling down training from the first week?  This is where it comes in, which is good.  The bad thing is that shit doesn't work precisely as advertised.  Feet and knees together, seven points of contact, roll out of the impact, etc.  Then you land ass/knees/head in that order and begin to understand why there are a dozen ambulances idling beside the DZ.  Broken legs, blown knees, you name it.

I regularly see references to the inclusion of silencers in the NFA tracing back to keeping poor people in the Great Depression from poaching.  Trouble is despite some pretty rigorous googling I can never find an **actual citation**.

Anyone happen to have have one?  It would make a pretty powerful counter argument with the casuals I find myself debating on a pretty regular basis.

Full disclosure:  I'm still reading the paper.  Apologies if it's in there and I just haven't seen it yet.

**EDIT:**  read most of it now, specifically the part that starts on page 14 entitled:

*B. How Suppressors Ended Up in the National Firearms Act of 1934 but Pistols and Revolvers Did Not*

In a nutshell the NRA pitched a shitfit when congress started talking about banning handguns, but nobody really spoke up about silencers.  True, there were some early, especially batshit writings that called for them to be banned because suddenly poor people, blacks and Italians (?) could afford firearms.

**But wait there's more!**

So I've started digging into some of the references of the paper, and in 84 See [J. DAVID TRUBY, THE QUIET KILLERS 18 \(1992\)](https://www.scribd.com/doc/7564263/The-Quiet-Killers) found this note:

*Of course, not everyone fell instantly in love with the Maxim invention. Crusader W. T. Hornaday, one of the alarmists of his day, called the Maxim invention a “break for every assassin.” He also held that strike breakers would be able to pop off strikers more easily. In fact, there may have been an element of truth in that, as a few Maxim silencers were used to quietly settle labor-management problems during a steel strike in 1909. Meanwhile, in New Jersey, two young men used silenced rifles to kill 6 horses on a farm, then demand an $800 ransom for their promise not to silently kill others. Police caught them and their Maxim silencers. Police in many cities banned silencer use.*",2016-06-08 15:47:17+00:00,d40zt1w,1.0,t3_4n4ptj,12561.0,gunpolitics

424,"Just remembered another.

There was this guy, an Arabic linguist.  He was WIDELY renowned for his next level weirdness within the CT community, even the CTIs were like fuck-me-what-is-up-with-that-guy.

- when in his barracks room, hotel room, or wherever he lived he was naked.  Period.  Even with roommates around if they would tolerate it.  

- He was all about death row.  Not the label.  People on death row.  Subscribed to a magazine that profiled them.  Had broken service and been a prison guard, thought it was the greatest shit ever.

- ate the weirdest fucking food.  Brought it on the plane (VQ) and whipped it out like it was no big.  Bizarre Greek sea urchin concoctions that looked like snot and smelled like as, for example.

- Had vaguely disturbingly close friendships with the Bengalis and Pakis that cleaned the place we lived.  Mannai Plaza if anyone was in the Gulf in the 90s.  Not like sexually close, which wouldn't have raised many eyebrows.  Like he was a hang around at an MC that wanted to join the club.  Hung out with them in their 20 man rooms out back.

- Couldn't do his job worth a shit, which was odd at the time.

- Weird ass voice, he pitched it like he was performing on stage.  Never used contractions.  Instead of ""let's go"" it was ""let us go""

- found out he was selected for Chief on det one time.  Decided to celebrate.  I should point out that he didn't drink for reasons he was very vague about.  I was there in the suite we both lived in, along with 4 or 5 other dudes.  Just me.  He decided to raid the freezer where the booze was.  Upended a third full bottle of Bombay, chugged it right on down.  Whooped and hollered some.  Repeated the process at least twice more over the following 30 minutes.  Began to get profoundly shithoused.  I decided to hit the rack.   He came plowing into my room a few minutes later, fell over the foot of my bed and wanted to know, really know, that I thought he deserved it.  I assured him was the best possible choice and hustled him out of my fucking room.  Repeated THAT process a couple more times before I finally remembered I could lock the door.  I locked it.  Two minutes later he runs jarringly headlong into the locked door, yells in pain and proceeds to vomit all over the floor right outside my room.  

**BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE.**

He transfers out of direct support and proceeds from Rota to Fort Gordon for shore duty.  While there, he proceeded to go to a drive through (Wendy's by some accounts) with his dick hanging out.  He pointed it out to the person at the window, and not getting the desired reaction, he drove around and went through again.  In uniform.

425,"Lieutenant Maurice ""Skip"" Stevens, hands down.

I met the LT when he was the CDSE for a few of my boat runs in the gulf back in the 90s.  He was a 1610 assigned to what was first COMUSNAVCENT  and later became C5F (yeah I'm fucking old, no lie).

Anyway, ship was about 6'2"", balding and had a pornstache (we all did back then).  He got the team together as we trickled in; CTIs from Fort Meade, R branchers rolling off whatever shit job they were doing in Bahrain, T-birds and Mat cranks typically out of HI or Yoko.  That's when the show started.

He was fond of giving everybody IQ tests for one thing.  Little quizzes like the ones all over facebook these days.  Then he had us give what were basically book reports on ourselves to each other, even when he was aware that people had known each other a few years.  Skip would have the team over to his villa in town for dinner and give us a tour of his I-love-me room.  

Skip had been an aviator of some fort, a pilot I believe.  He'd had an epiphany one day when, returning from a float where he flew a prowler on a Libyan strike mission, he realized that of his entire class in pilot school or whatever, he and one other guy were the only two left alive and uninjured.  So he converted to cryppie.  

But let me back up.  Skip had originally enlisted in the Navy as an AT.  Recognizing his inherent genius and mastery of the material, he had been kept on at the A school in Jax (I think) to go directly to an instructor billet.  He then parlayed that success into some kind of pilot OCS program and voila!  Pilot.

So back to the Gulf.  when my buddy and I were oggling his I-love-me shit, there was a glass box with a pilot helmet, some aircrew gloves laid across each other palms up in front of it, and in them sat...a pair of NAC wings.  Weird I thought, seeing how I was aircrew and recognized a pair of the wings I, enlisted scum, wore daily.

Anyway, we got underway.  If you've ever been a rider on a sub you know it's a tough room to work.  You breath air, eat chow, use water and generally don't do anything that the incredibly tight and admittedly hard working as hell crew gives a rat's ass about.  So you go out of your way to be an ambassador.  Show up to the boat when they're striking stores?  Get your civvie wearing ass in the line and start humping.  Heading p the ladder when someone's coming down?  Get out of the way.  Be neat.  Be professional.  Just try not to needlessly annoy anyone because if you do, you've just annoyed 100 other dudes.  

So Skip fucking Stevens rolls out of his stateroom as soon as we pull the plug to go deep wearing a fucking blue flight suit.  The kind the fucking Blue Angels wear.  With wings and shit on it.  XO takes one look at him, says jesus fucking christ and gives Skip one of his own poopy suits.  That's how the ride started.  Skip went on to be generally weird for that run, and a couple of others I had the bad luck to be on with him.

Fast forward to sometihng like 96 or so and there's this big ass RIF going on.  People getting paid to go home, even for PT failures.  We called it the EFF program, Eat for Freedom.  Arabic linguists got force converted to MA, officers just got cashed out with no options.  I run into Skip, still there in Bahrain.  He's all giddy because he was getting RIFed and paid $90K.  At the time the SRB ceiling was $30K.  Being pretty salty if I do say so, I said ""damn LT they're paying you three times as much to leave as they are me to stay.""  Oddly that deflated him somewhat.  So Skip, relying on his pilot background, gets a job with some company in Texas that planed to take surplus, demilled former Soviet fighters and sold them or let people pay for joyrides.  This was shortly after the USSR collapsed, so it was not unusual.

All of this was going swimmingly for Skip until he [crashed a plane killing himself and the reporter sitting next to him](http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/ntsb-to-study-video-of-crash/article_5afd40e0-188f-5e89-b69f-f7ccd97e01ee.html).

Turns out it was all bullshit.  He had [failed out of flight school and was never a qualified aviator at all](http://newsok.com/article/2476656).

What happens after July is that a ruling called [ATF 41F](https://www.atf.gov/file/100896/download) goes into effect.  41F actually makes it somewhat easier to buy suppressors, short barreled rifles, short barreled shotguns, etc.  The requirement to gain approval of your local head of law enforcement (often the county police or sheriff) turns into a requirement to notify them.  That's the biggest difference I'm aware of.  There's also an added requirement for identification, but that's about it.  Anyone feel free to correct me or elaborate.

Anyway, the sales guy gives them the how-can-I-help-you bit, whereupon the man points to a shotgun, looks at the woman and says ""that's the one.""  Boom.  No pretense, subterfuge or anything.  The woman then immediately tells the sales guy ""I want to buy that shotgun.""

The man had been in earlier and apparently fingerbanged the shotgun real good, so the sales guy asked who it was for.  The woman then gave up the game (such as it was) by pointing to the man and saying ""it's for him.""  Full stop.

The manager is over in a jiffy and the entire thing gets shut down.  The show is over at that point, but the drama...drama never ends.  They couple both get irate as fuck and commence to hollering at the the manager and the sales guy.  The man/old fart keeps saying that it's outrageous and he doesn't even need to buy the shotgun there because he has his own **AND I QUOTE** ""FAA license and everything.""

Eventually he realized he was claiming to be a pilot or some such nonsense and they stomped off in a huff.  I got on with my feeble quest for rimfire.  My wife, who was there with me and is hugely fond of shooting my guns, asked what had just happened.  We all then explained that the couple had attempted to commit a felony.

506,"Yeah you see them.  The treatment they get ranges from mild shunning that's not super visible to outright ostracism that's very blatant and public.  It all depends on the tone of the specific mess.  Some want to be seen doling out punishment, others keep mess business in the mess. YMMV.

As for the process itself, the value has varied over time.  When I went through (FY98) it was gratuitous hazing.  Lots of stupid human tricks, a fair amount of vomiting.  And it started in early July for 10 solid weeks. That was the last year that booze wasn't prohibited.  Then there was an identity crisis over the next few years, when in the post-Tailhook environment it nearly went away.  During the peak of the wars, there seemed to be a new found appreciation of actually delivering training and there were genuine efforts to improve the quality and end product.  Over the last four or five years it seems to have been over corrected and has turned into something altogether unchalleninging and mostly academic.  CPO365 was supposed to have been a way to get the basic stuff knocked out so that they season could focus on the real issues of leadership, responsibilities and so on without having to teach Selectees how to march.  It was orignally optional, then mandatory for all board eligibles, then every single PO1 got roped into it.  It should be noted that the main reason for all the changes is that there is a constant threat of banning it at the OPNAV level that the MCPON has to constantly try to avoid by tweaking it (source: frank conversations with several of them).

Pro Tip:  a lot of things that are uniformly mandatory are a waste of time.  See GMT for further examples.

Anyway, the process is optional by definition.  I ran it one year at a major shore command and we had a few people quit on day one.  Three out of 50 or so total.  Turned out we had a couple get super ill and basically go SIQ for the entire six weeks, so we had to run a special Induction right after the regular one and two of them wound up opting back in given the chance.  The remaining one cited religious reasons for not going through and stuck to it.

What I can say is that regardless of the negative repercussions for not going through, the benefit of going through the season are that it's the only way at this point in time to be fully empowered and capable of functioning at the paygrade and in the role of a Chief.

REF B IS NAVADMIN 110/06, NAVY UNIFORMS.// RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the revision to the Navys personal appearance policy as it pertains to tattoos and expands the manner of wear of the Navy Working Uniform Type II and III (NWU Type II/III).  References (a) and (b) are revised.

2.  Effective 30 days after the release of this NAVADMIN, a modification of the Navys tattoo policy regarding acceptable criteria while in uniform will be in effect.  This policy change is meant to ensure we dont miss opportunities to bring in talented young men and women willing to serve.

    a.  Location.  One tattoo is authorized on the neck and shall not exceed one inch in measurement in any dimension (height/width).  Tattoos meeting these requirements are acceptable behind the ear.  Permissible tattoos on the torso area of the body shall not be visible through white uniform clothing.  No tattoos are permitted on the head, face (to include ear) and scalp.

    b.  Size.  The size restriction for visible tattoos is limited to the area of the neck and behind the ear only.  As a result of this change, leg and arm tattoos can be of any size.  Tattoo on the neck or behind the ear will not exceed one inch in measurement in any dimension (height/width).

    c.  Content.  Tattoos located anywhere on the body that are prejudicial to good order, discipline, and morale or are of a nature to bring discredit upon the naval service are prohibited.  For example, tattoos that are obscene, sexually explicit, and or advocate discrimination based on sex, race, religion, ethnicity, or national origin are prohibited.  In addition, tattoos that symbolize affiliation with gangs, supremacist or extremist groups, or advocate illegal drug use are prohibited.  Waivers will not be given for tattoos with prohibited content.

    d.  Cosmetic Tattoos.  Cosmetic tattoos are authorized to correct medical conditions requiring such treatment.  For the purpose of this regulation, cosmetic tattooing refers to medical or surgical procedures conducted by licensed, qualified medical personnel.

3.  Documentation of waiverable and non-waiverable tattoos will be accomplished via Administrative Remarks (NAVPERS 1070/613).  NAVPERS 1070/613 will be submitted for inclusion in the electronic service record via the local personnel support detachment for enlisted personnel and mailed to Records Analysis Branch (PERS-312) for officer personnel.  Sailors not complying with the established criteria are in violation of uniform policy and are subject to disciplinary action to include involuntary separation.

546,"In a nutshell:


&gt; The new rules, announced Thursday and taking effect April 30, will allow sailors to:
&gt; 
&gt; * Have multiple or large tattoos below the elbow or knee, including the wrists and hands, effectively allowing sleeve tattoos that can be seen even while wearing short sleeve uniforms.
&gt; 
&gt; * Have one tattoo on their neck, which includes behind the ear, and it may not exceed 1 inch in length or height in either or both directions.
&gt; 
&gt; * Sailors with visible tattoos will now be eligible for recruiting duty or leading recruits at boot camp in Great Lakes, Illinois. These tough assignments often give sailors a leg up to make rank.

It does sound like a pain in the ass, to be honest.  That being said I still kind of want one, but in the right caliber.  Seems like the urge for the casual owner would be for the biggest caliber tolerable for the holy shit factor, but barrel length and burn rates popped into my head immediately.  

I kind of equate these to the SPAS12, which I owned briefly in the 90s.  It was a complete fuckpuzzle and all around pain in the nutsack.

571,"If you want to write a letter, by all means do so.  There are two things that each panel member MUST look at before finalizing your record and scoring it:  

1 - adverse material

2 - member correspondence

If you write it, it will beyond any doubt be read.  That's not your question though; *should* you write one.

That's a matter of conjecture.  Short of truly shitting down your leg in written form, it's very difficult to do yourself any harm with a letter.  Mild annoyance is possible, but when panel members are scoring 25+ records daily nobody is going to go out of their way to screw you over it.

My advice has always been that there are a few situations that well and truly call for a letter to board president:

- your assignment and eval history is a complete fuck puzzle.  Say you have a TEMDUINS, a couple transfers, a concurrent and change of reporting senior.  A chronological guide to that shit is handy.

- something is demonstrably wrong.  I mean serious, Category 5 Tomfuckery.  I don't mean the usual petty shitsnivelling, I mean IG material that isn't resolved.  You'll know it when you see it.

- unexpected windfall.  Say that bronze star came through, or you squeezed out your fifth pin or whatever, and it just didn't make it into your eval for whatever reason.  Or you want to make sure the board sees it: oh-golly-I'm just-not-sure-if-this-made-it-in.  That can work.

That's about it.  Letters get too much hype in my opinion.

Then again so is NATO standard ammo like 5.56 or 7.62x51, so from an opsec standpoint it's a toss up.  Its middling from a ballistic perspective, a medium to high foot pound energy round.  Again, a toss up in performance.

659,"Eh...I've lamented the change from technical leaders to babysitting social workers in the Mess before, and still feel it's true.  That being said, they're just responding to direction from above like anyone else in the Nav.  There are plenty of good Chiefs everywhere.  The push for the current, ubiquitous policy of leadership by nitpicking began with the establishment of the 9580 community.  Once that really got traction it turned otherwise fully functional Master Chiefs into some sort of wannabe senior executive Stepford wife role.  I never saw senior enlisted with aides, drivers and the overwheening self importance that is commonplace now.  

I sat a couple of selection boards, and one time at breakfast there I was at a table with a bunch of other random 9s.  Being somewhat sociable I introduced myself by name, like you do.  To a person they all introduced themselves by title and then said ""call me Force"" or ""Call me Fleet"".  Like it wasn't a bunch of fucking Sailors TAD in a shitty Navy Lodge eating a microwaved breakfast.  True Story.

Anyway, the CMC role started as a good idea but these days it's mainly political stuffed shirt hacks who get into it for the prestige and perks.  And THAT trickles down.  First to Command Senior Chiefs and then out to the rest of the Mess.  

Then you get exactly what you described.

Statements in response to an eval don't do what you think they do.  What might accomplish your goal of mitigating the career impact of a P and increasing your odds for selection is a letter to the board.  And I say **might** very specifically.

Deployment, long term hospitalization, lack of signatories, etc.  Being able to document a good faith effort on your part to complete it and being kept from doing so would also work.

2A Sales in Laurel is a great little store with a friendly, knowledgeable staff.  I've bought several guns and a lot of miscellaneous stuff there.

On Target has a great staff right now but that has not always been the case.  It's a somewhat bigger store so they require more employees.  The huge draw they have is the 16 lane, 25 yard indoor pistol range.  Gun prices are pretty steep.

768,"Finally one I can answer!

I'm XP level 46, HQ 19 and have Level 2 grenadiers.

I've been using them over 90% of the time since I got them.  I like the challenge, mainly.  The thing with Grens is they do a LOT of damage, but it's over a really, really wide area and takes time to add up.  That being said, they also damage a lot of things at once, too.

I use them almost exclusively with Medics for a mix of 6 medics and 15 grens in an attack.  I virtually always launch the entire wave right off the bat.

I should mention that you should upgrade your residences highly to pay for the loss of entire waves of them while you're getting the hang of them.

Good practices with grens:

- go after short range defenses like MGs and flamers to maintain stand off from long range defenses like boom cannons and snipers.  Grens mainly miss long, so the over shoot will always damage and usually destroy the stuff farther down range.  

- stick and move, stick and move.  Develop really good flaring skills to keep the little bastards from wiping themselves out.  and they will if you let them.

- Don't get them too close to a target as their grenades will damage themselves and others.

- They are FRAGILE.  Like zooka fragile.  Always keep medics with them and throw med kits often.  The upside is they heal super fast.

- Once I got them, I found that critters work really well in concert with grens.  If you have an HQ that's taking forever to reduce (which happens often), let some GBE pile up from all the crap they destroy on the far side of the the target, then launch critters between the grens and the target, closest to the grens.  The critters can often stay just inside the frag range and help destroy the target.

I love grenadiers, they're hands down my favorite unit.  That said, there are some targets the just do not work against.  Long runs through defenses can take too much time.  Anything with too many long range defenses up front will be hard.  For those times, you need to learn how to hit the easy button and do smoke rushes of zookas/warriors, or just learn to live with those islands not being yours.  On average I have to do that about once a week.

Have fun with your grenadiers!",2015-12-15 15:21:39+00:00,cxzsfcw,1.0,t3_3wrxl1,98930.0,BoomBeach

917,"Down at the ground level things are actually fairly chill.  It's at the legislative level that things are hosed here.  A fair amount of gerrymandering, party machine politics and dense population centers has resulted in some truly craptacular laws. 

On the other hand, those laws are really pretty poorly written as one might expect having been crafted by people trying to regulate things they profoundly misunderstand.  FSA2013 outright bans M-16, AR-15s and clones by and large.  Unless you'r'e talking about an HBAR competition target platform, which having a barrel OD of 0.75"" or better is fine.  Or if it's an AR in something roughly .27 caliber or greater, which is fine.  Or if it's a pistol, in which case caliber doesn't matter.  

So an old school M16A2?  Probably banned.  That suppressed AR pistol in 300BLK?  Totes fine.  AR builds?  Also good to go.  NFA Items?  Maryland is one of the very most NFA-friendly states anywhere.

So while it's not good on the surface, it's nowhere NEAR as bad as CA, MA, NY, NJ, etc, mainly because of slapdash legislation.  The new governor is rolling things back, too.  Not as fast as anyone would like, but still.  The first thing he did was get rid of the requirement for a fired case to be held on file with the state police for all new handguns sold, mainly because it was (a) burdensome on buyers and sellers and (b) was a stupid system that just stored a shit ton of brass without any kind of way to use it.

So I wake up and order coffee, get all my body parts to reach a consensus and agree to start moving.  Once the room service showed I turned on CNN and saw the second plane hit live.

I watched for about five minutes, saw the loop and immediately called Jim next door.  Told him we were at delta.  Jim was asleep and understandably confused by this, so I told him to turn on his tv.  Jim then agreed we were at delta.  The one thing we both realized was that,  being at the end of the deployment, we had zero chance of hitting the gold souk in the near future.

We quickly got mobile, got a cab and went shopping for the girlfriends.  Shit you not.  Once we got back to the hotel we went down to the bar.

I am indeed shooting out of revolver, 5 inch barrel.  Understood on the separation issues with plated bullets at high velocities.  I'm only putting holes in paper, and not a whole lot as I just scooped up 500 on a whim.

I've got regular and magnum primers, so I'm leaning toward saving the magnums for full on magnum rounds.  The plan that's taking shape as I gather data (more than I might need because safety) is to start right at a 10gn charge and creep upward.  Hell if those perform well enough I might even stay right there, this isn't a couple of weekends worth of rounds.

I like the idea of using a powder better at higher velocities for magnum rounds, so will probably just switch to jacketed after this batch is done.

I pulled this out of the breech of the barrel.  

In my haste I thought that this was the primer and it had somehow been subjected to a weird pressure vortex and gotten extruded through the flash hole.  

Full disclosure:  I have to admit that the thought of having ruined a really expensive pistol might have clouded my judgement.

Aaaanyway...my only idea, and it came to me after reading your comment about the striker mark, was that this is actually a rimfire case.  Once I considered that and looked at it again, I felt really, really stupid because there it is.  Plain as day a 22lr case that's been blown up.

Going back through the circumstances, I  was forced to consider that since all of my reloads go directly into MTM 100 round cases straight from the bin on my 500, they then go directly to the range like that.  I use a dymo label maker to label them and everything.  Once at the range (I shoot at an indoor pistol range during the summer because it's miserable here), I set my bag under the shelf in front of me, then put the boxes of ammo on the shelf.  Then the pistol comes out, I shoot, etc.

The only, and I mean ONLY thing that could explain this, and I believe it does, is that I had a 22lr case stuck inside a .357 case and in a moment of breathtaking carelessness loaded the thing.

You are, I believe, absolutely right, /u/Cantonious.  

Thanks also for the answer on the powder charges in your other comment.  I don't know if it will apply, but the charge weight of Bullseye will probably not be relevant for the foreseeable future as I'm almost out.

1041,"GREAT!  Another Maryland reloader, I can help.

As stated previously, get some books:

The [Lee Reloading Manual](http://www.amazon.com/Lee-Precision-Modern-Reloading-Format/dp/B000N8OKAU/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1438170108&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=reloading+manual) is good, just know that the first 100 pages is a treatise on how awesome Richard Lee is.  Great resource, though.

[The Beginner's Guide to Reloading Ammunition](http://www.amazon.com/Beginners-Guide-Reloading-Ammunition-ebook/dp/B00B52LFJC/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1438170108&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=reloading+manual) is also excellent.

There are several types of reloading books:  

Powder company books

Bullet company books

Press and Die company books

One caliber books.  Those are more like pamphlets, but often cover almost everything there is on one caliber.


They all have a predictable bias, but are all good to have.  Buy several manuals and read them often.

As for components, the bullet sources listed elsewhere in this thread are all solid choices.  I'd check out [Eggleston Munitions](http://www.egglestonmunitions.com/) also.  I use them a lot in .357 and have been pretty happy with them.

Brass is pretty readily available.  You can save it from factory ammo or buy it new or used.  [Sample google search](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=.357%20brass) for your convenience.  The great thing about straight wall pistol cases is that they last a long time if you don't load too hot (i.e. at or above the max loads listed in your manuals).  Added bonus for wheelguns:  easy brass retention.

Now for powder and primers things are a little more challenging here in the ""Free State"".  Retailers face pretty steep storage requirements so not a lot of places carry powder on the shelves.  A few more keep primers in stock.  Thankfully the stores that carry either actually seem to have them in stock pretty normally these days.  Retail is the way to go if you're buying a pound at a time since it allows you to avoid the approximately $25/pound hazmat shipping fee.  If you go straight to 8 pound jugs it's a little more economical to buy online.  It'll come straight to your doorstep regardless.

For retail, Bass Pro carries powder, primers and has a couple of aisles of reloading tools and supplies.  Lots of presses, tumblers, doodads and so on.  Brass too, but it's relatively expensive.  An added bonus of Bass Pro is that you can buy online and have it delivered to a store and pick it up there, avoiding the hazmat fee AND it gives you access to everything in stock system wide.

Now being as we're in Maryland, I feel pretty strongly about supporting in state 2A businesses.  Keeping them flush means more access for current shooters and more entry points for new shooters, so I try to spend money locally whenever possible.  Depending on what part of the state you're in I'd recommend calling gun stores.  I'm in AA county, and the choices are freaking SLIM.  I can say that [2A Sales](http://www.2asales.com/) carries primers and brass, and is a super cool LGS in general.  [On Target](http://ontarget.biz/) has an incredibly pathetic reloading cases, mainly filled with 20+ year old crap, but they do have a 16 lane indoor 25 yard pistol range, so that's handy.  If you show up with your own ammo and eye/ear pro, you can shoot for a couple of hours for $20 give or take.  If you're out west in the Frederick or Hagerstown area, I'm pretty confident you'll have better luck.  You can also get out to WV/VA/PA more easily.  Possibly better access to supplies on the eastern shore, too.

Two final things:

- don't think that reloading will lead to cheaper shooting.  It leads to shooting a lot more for the same price.

- reloading is a hobby within a hobby and gets really engrossing, really fast

- you never have all the equipment you need.  There's always one more thing.  Don;t get wrapped around the axle figuring out when the equipment will pay for itself, it'll happen within 500 rounds, more or less.

Anyway, good luck and welcome!  Feel free to reply or PM with any questions, I'm ALWAYS happy to help MD Shooters.

1060,"Retired MCPO here.  Seen it all when it comes to making Chief.  Initiated in 97, sponsored numerous selectees, ran committees, chaired the season at a major shore command, sat selection boards.

As has been established, it is not mandatory.  Is it recommended?  Most people will recommend it, so in that context, yes.  Should you go through?  Well that's up to you.  You will get into a network that is pretty strong, and that can help outside the NAV.  Yeah you'll be given the silent treatment while you're in uniform, but if you're separating regardless that's no big deal.

What I can say is that you ought to make up your mind and stick to it, before the list comes out if possible.  It will cut down on the workload of everyone in the season if you are either in or out at kickoff.

The season I ran started with 48 selectees and we finished somewhere in the high 30s.  The attrites were:

- one quit and stayed quit
- two quit and decided to unquit
- two got really sick
- a couple PCSed
- a few more deployed

We ran the ones who were sick or changed their minds back through a second season that went mid-Sep to late Oct.  Tiring as hell, but no big.

As for the season itself and the merits, I do recommend it.  When I got Initiated (and I use that word advisedly), they made us eat all kinds of nasty shit until we puked.  There was PLENTY of outright hazing, pretty much non-stop for 10 weeks (the season used to be a month longer).  

Then people did stupid shit over the years, Tailhook happened, various scandals and it all got nerfed damn near to death.  Then around the early to mid 2000s, roughly coincident with the escalation of the wars, it began to get an edge back.  People kept doing stupid shit, as they always will, but there more important things to think about at the time.  

These days there is a lot of actual training and leadership development built into the process, but there's also a lot of self-congratulatory backslapping.  That whole ""I'm a Chief and I'm great because Navy Chief Navy Pride"" herd mentality.  Then there's the leadership by social work nanny mindset.  Chiefs get all wrapped around the axle of taking-care-of-Sailors to exclusion of all else, so they become collateral kings and queens, can't do their fucking job, etc.  Don't take that to mean there aren't a lot of solidly professional Chiefs who are masters at their rating, they just aren't all up in everyone's grill trying to make Chief of the Year.

I just ran eight large batches or so through the FA tumbler this weekend, or doing brass laundry as my wife and I call it.  I spent about 15 minutes cycling between batches using this process:

1 - tumble

2 - dump through slotted end cap with screening inserted, into a bowl.

3 - pour out dark water, remove very few pins from bowl and return to tumbler drum.

4 - run clean water through tumbler, rotating to ensure thoroughness.  Again over bowl to catch pins.

5 - Dump entire drum into rotary separator, spin for five minutes or so.

6 - Scoop brass into dehydrator.  

7 - Scoop pins back into drum, repeat from step one.

I don't know if it's dumb luck or what, but I didn't have any pins go from the separator to the dehydrator.  Being my first time using it, I inspected each batch pretty closely.

1076,"/u/A_Plinkers_Damn is right about the Lee manual.  Excellent load data, preceded by an exhaustive dissertation about how awesome Richard Lee is and how much all other gear sucks.  I still use it all the time.

The Lyman manual is also excellent.

I bought the Hornady manual because it has load data for .44AMP, but I also use it for comparing load data from other books.

The ABCs of reloading isn't terrible, and it has the added bonus of begin written by a guy who blew both his hands clean off, but it's dated.  The author mentions the rise in popularity of auto-loading rifles due to returning soldiers for instance.  I have it though, and check it for procedural stuff occasionally.

I don't have [this manual](http://www.amazon.com/Beginners-Guide-Reloading-Ammunition-Apartment/dp/148207379X/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1437055899&amp;sr=8-9&amp;keywords=reloading+manual) but it does look pretty solid.

If you want to get into precision rifle shooting, I highly recommend anything by [Brian Litz](http://www.amazon.com/Bryan-Litz/e/B00J216MMI).

I'm a firm believer in having a shelf full of reloading books.  The thing to know is that almost everyone who published one has an agenda.  Bullet manufacturers publish data for their bullets with a lot of different powders.  Powder companies publish data for a lot of different bullet brands on top of their powder.  That's not necessarily bad, as they have tested their products extensively.

1096,"In the beginning there was barely any security and certainly no forcepro.  This changed incrementally over time with some major leaps:

**late 1980s:**  Many bases were open posts.  Streets just ran right through them and there was nobody to ask who you were, much less challenge.  This is across the services, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Army.


**Early 1990s:**  Some gates began to go up, and a 24/7 presence was increasingly common.  This was mainly to keep people from going to the clubs on base over weekends, or to keep them out of the exchange as neither place really carded that hard.  It's worth pointing out that base E clubs were the shit back in the day.  Cheap booze, no age limit with a green card (this was pre-CAC and IDs were laminated and green), and it was not uncommon to see strippers (M and F) at base clubs.

**Mid 1990s -** [Khobar Tower Bombing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khobar_Towers_bombing) changed a LOT of shit.  Overseas installation gor locked down in a quick hurry,  followed more lethargically by stateside installations.  Curfew, pillboxes, you name it.  It got really old really fast, and things were probably about to chill a hair until...


**Late 1990s:**  [the Embassy bombings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_United_States_embassy_bombings), which cranked forcepro right into a higher gear that it's been in ever since.  About this time, I *think* FP conditions came out.  Curfews got tighter as well.  These fancy new CAC cards began to appear initially about this time IIRC.  In Manama specifically, a USMC FAST team started what would turn out to be a nearly 2 year deployment, for instance.  


**to answer your specific questions:
**
&gt; I imagine absolute mayhem, with anyone and anything being able to come and go as they please onboard ships and bases alike,

Bases, yes.  Ships, not really.  That said a standard in port watch was usually one schmuck third class with a 1911 at the brow and not much else.  Often in SDBs.

&gt;  with a reactionary response to any issues that may have risen, versus the preventative measures we see today.

Nailed that one.


&gt; Who manned the gates? 

Usually some random soul from X-Div, 10, or whatever org handled that on any given base.  The specific people often came from a manning tax on the various units and tenant commands on a base.  You'd a get a few hours-ling ""class"" stand a few UI watches and then you were off and running.

&gt; How was base access controlled? 

At first in my time very little, later increasingly so.  When I say very little I mean in a lot of places there was literally not a gate to man and nobody there.  

&gt; What training did the MAs/ ASF/ NSF have before? 

I was on ASF when I was a PO3, training consisted of range quals and some very disorganized crap that the local collateral duty MAC (who was not an MA) slapped together.  I did it for an eval bullet and because I got a range card and could go shoot there on the weekends.  I never actually did any ASF stuff.

&gt; What did force protection consist of prior to these events?

Like I alluded to above, the concept of Force Protection didn't exist until around late 90s.  Or maybe it did, but at the large base I was stationed at, and all of the units I deployed to at the time (and there were many) it was never mentioned.",2015-07-06 13:23:27+00:00,cstrpaj,1.0,t3_3ca4z5,18485.0,navy

It's ugly as shit, unlike yours by the way, but I plan to paint it.

1106,"The odds aren't necessarily bad, and lot of it depends on the language specifically.  Manning levels, recruiting demand, etc.

Having threes is a huge plus, regardless.  

A recruiter will be able to answer some questions, but I also would give the CTI Techad a call.  It's jumping to the high end of the food chain, but fuck it, you're not even in the Navy.  I'm also used to just calling people and asking them to do their jobs, YMMV.

Anyway, give this cat a call:
