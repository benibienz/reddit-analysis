Unlike me, almost all of them are apoplectically against gun ownership.  I'm at the far, other end of that spectrum and am an enthusiastic shooter, reloader, builder and have been for over 30 years.  The topic comes up a lot and I have a hard time breaking through the shrillness of the sincere but entirely, extremely emotional arguments I encounter.  Hell a couple of times I've been shouted down, which is very disappointing.

Anyway.

I've been thinking about how to get past the barriers and have an actual conversation and it comes down to being heard.  So here's my idea:

""You're advocating sweeping changes based on minimal information and first hand experience.  That's no different than a right wing representative or senator saying they're no scientist and then promptly ignoring science to vehemently oppose climate change regulation or defunding research.  When they act from a position of willful ignorance on things like marriage equality, reproductive rights or immigration we flip our shit, and rightfully so.  What you're doing is the same thing, reacting to hyperbolic, histrionic headlines to fall over yourself to enact some knee jerk over reaction without any kind of knowledge of the matter.""

I'm trying to find a research/training resource that can help me learn how to automate a report run in Cognos via excel.  The whole thing takes place on a private VPN, and I'm an intermediate use with basic VBA experience so naturally I'm kind of stumped.  I get that I'm over reaching my skill set, but I'm already able to run the report in native Cognos, I just want to use this as a learning project that, if successful, I can push out to my PMs to save us all some time.

The challenge is that despite extensive googling and youtubing, I can't find anything that's quite right.  I'm not looking for anyone to do the work of scripting the module for me, that's asking a lot.  Much of the details are extremely specific and it requires access to a proprietary corporate network in any case. 

So...any ideas where I should look or how I should tailor my search string?

Disclaimer:  have been through office support, the sidebar, all the big youtube channels already, but it's possible I missed something.

1 - starting and max loads are all over the place.  Some references call for 8 grains and change, others start at 13 or more.  I know to start very conservative and inch up, so my question is whether I'm missing something.

2 - Primers.  There is a lot of discussion on using magnum primers or standard primers with 2400, and it runs the gamut from ""never do it"" to ""only do it"".  What's the consensus?

3 - Plated bullets.  There is very sparse data about loading plated that I've found aside from ""load in the middle of the charge for a the same weight jacketed bullet"".  Mainly with this one I just wonder if I've missed a really obvious source of load data.

It's completely wrong.  Bottom line:  I need to pay even more attention because I managed to load a .357 round with a spent .22lr case stuck inside it.  
**

Hopefully this is a simple question, because it's got me stumped.

So I loaded some .357 today using my standard recipe out of the Lyman manual:

5.9gn Bullseye

Winchester Small Pistol Magnum Primers (not the recommended CCI primers, but I can't find them)

155gn Poly coated bullets

COAL: 1.600 - 1.610

Mixed factory brass that I fired myself, no range pickup cases

Chiappa Rhino 50DS (5"" barrel)
So I had a [complete primer rupture](http://i.imgur.com/NMIK5AE.jpg).  As you can see it was pretty spectacular.  More pics [here](http://i.imgur.com/rCEesgx.jpg), [here](http://i.imgur.com/jUOPn9K.jpg), [here](http://i.imgur.com/C2dWj7S.jpg), and [here](http://i.imgur.com/p8yuHHC.jpg).


So the load above was one I specifically chose because it was fairly moderate.  I'm just shooting paper, not long range silhouettes or hunting.  Anyway, I have a few possible conclusions and I'm hoping someone can help narrow the cause down for me:

-  WSPM primers are hotter than normal

- WSP primers are weaker than normal

- radical variation in case volume leading to over pressure.  A quick survey of ~150 cases looks like the Federal brass is more prone to flattened primers.  

- Fucking gremlins.

Anyway, I'd appreciate any info a lot as this is my favorite wheel gun and I'd rather not turn it into a grenade.

Cheers.

Do you all think it's possible to put a mesh screen insert into one of the slotted end pieces?  My idea is to be able to dump most or all of the water while retaining the brass and pins, then dump them into my regular spinning seprator.

Any reason that wouldn't work?  Trying to get it sorted out before the tumbler gets here, lots of brass to clean and I want to get cracking.
