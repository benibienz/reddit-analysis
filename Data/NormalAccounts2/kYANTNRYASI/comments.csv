Think about if you have ever been outside at night and saw a house or a car or a person with a flashlight. You always see the light well before you can see the things around the light. Same with the cannibals. They see the light easily and then go to investigate.

I have found that cannibals often patrol the beach both during the day and the night, so it is already a danger zone even without the fire drawing attention to you.",2016-11-16 18:12:20+00:00,da314wz,,t1_d9w4x54,,TheForest

4,"You can carry logs down ropes, but not up ropes. You can use this to get logs into caves using the rope entrances.

The best way to do this is to grab two logs, climb down the rope until you are a bit of the way down, then drop the logs and go up for more logs. At the end, you'll have a pile of logs at the bottom of the rope. The hole on the surface is too small to drop logs through, and it you drop the logs too high on the rope it is possible for them to get stuck in the cave wall.

My friend and I used this technique to build a platform with a rope in one cave because the entrance we found was actually just a small room with a cliff on one side leading down. This was supposed to be an exit to the cave where you found the climbing axe, but we didn't know that at the time and entered through the back door, but only with the help of the platform and rope.",2016-11-07 18:11:03+00:00,d9pui8x,3.0,t1_d9pajpx,39178.0,TheForest

7,"Concerning dried meat being instantly ready to eat when put on fire - I took that as mainly a way to share meat cause when you are in the caves and your buddy forgot to pack a lunch is there any other way to give him dried meat?

Just to add to this comment about meat. I know people say 2.2 meats a day or whatever, but lately I've been having about 1 in 3 days where I eat meat from the drying rack and it barely restores and hunger. I have to eat 3 pieces of meat to get to get full (on those days). Then other days the meat will fill me up as normal. It is very strange - I assume when I have to eat 3 pieces of meat it means I've gotten to meat that has been on the drying rack for a very long time and maybe has gone bad (I've pulled meat off my drying rack before and it says it is spoiled even though I've never put and spoiled meat on there)? Anyway, it doesn't seem to have made a difference as my weight is still 205 and strength going up, so I think that the best, most consistent diet is to strictly eat meat except when necessary - like keep berries or oysters for when you are on a long trip in the caves and your meat finally runs out.",2016-09-23 14:00:22+00:00,d7yubm2,2.0,t1_d7y3e5l,55807.0,TheForest

If you are a man, then it is stressful because you set a budget that you are barely comfortable with and then you watch as the bride keeps asking for more and more expensive things, and you don't care what color the napkins are... but she can't make the decision without you, and even after you make a choice you have to sit there as she debates with the wedding planner which color would look better. Also, you have no say in the wedding - you are only there as an accessory to the bride and her whims. Even though she asked you what you thought about the bridesmaids dresses, its not like she will change them due to your opinion. I mean, its HER wedding.

If you are a woman, then its stressful because your man will be too stressed about the money to help you and you'll basically have to do most if it by yourself. Then, at the end, after you have talked to your man about the wedding over and over again, he still won't remember anything about it. The color of the tablecloths? Nope.

This happened in both covenants but I wasn't in the watchdogs nearly as much as aldrich faithful so I can't speak as much for that one.

I would not mind adding a weekly roulette to coil which rewards a single, random item from Alex loot (lens, crank, spring, bolt, chain, or shaft, or pedal).

I also would not mind getting a random Alex loot for clearing any floor with a first timer - this loot could be lotted on by all party members and like Alex, could only be gotten once per week.

73,"Players do: only spam one ability/weaponskill until someone teaches them to use multiple abilities

Raid idea: all weaponskills and abilities are locked at the start of the raid and defeating certain bosses in the dungeon unlock abilities for the players

------------------------------------------------

Players do: vote kick noobs

Raid idea: after each boss is a door that can only be opened after the boss is dead and a player is kicked. There are six bosses so everyone except two people get kicked by the end. No pre-mades allowed! Better loot drops if you kick the players with the highest dps.

------------------------------------------------

Players do: craft/gather all day

Raid idea: 24 man raid where each party is tank, healer, 2 dps, 2 crafter, 2 gatherer... and the only items you can take in are level 1 main hands. must gather/craft everything else. Enemies start out weak and you can kill them with your level 1 weapons, but they get a lot tougher as you go so crafters and gatherers need to work fast or the dungeon timer will run out.

------------------------------------------------

Players do: FATE/HUNT grinding

Raid idea: Raid bosses are spread throughout a whole area like North Shroud and as you are looking for the bosses you have to kill, FATEs will spawn which buff the bosses. You have to clear the FATEs for the buff to go away. FATEs can respawn as usual.

------------------------------------------------

Players do: Create parties and enter dungeons

Raid idea: Role reversal - players start in an empty boss room and the bosses are the ones ""raiding"" the dungeon. They have 1 minute before the bosses arrive. Like most, this dungeon has three boss rooms, so if the players are defeated, they respawn in the 2nd boss room and have another minute to prepare. If they lose again they move to last room. Once the bosses are defeated the raid is complete. Normally dungeons are harder as you go through, so player *item levels* are synced to say i160 for the first room, i175 for the second, and i190 for the last (you get the idea).

------------------------------------------------

Players do: not dodge shit

Raid idea: The boss does massive raid-wide damage every few seconds (like T4 enrage) but its AoE abilities heal you to full HP make up for it... but if more than 3 people get hit by the same AoE its an instant wipe :D

------------------------------------------------

Players do: sometimes have no idea what the f is going on

Raid idea: There is a different boss depending on the day of the week and the moon cycle, who sometimes just stands there like he went afk and other times just runs around, and sometimes ignores the order it is supposed to attack things and just randomly targets people... and the final mechanic is always random from all the possible insta-kill mechanics in the game.

80,"Per your example, choosing to add level 70 to the game vs adding ilevel 300 is a design choice. Some games are all about the items and they have absolutely no levels (think terraria or minecraft). Sure, they could give us the extra stats with extra levels but the difference is that normally you gain levels simply by playing the game while items are normally through achievement. You can level up on weak monsters or FATEs until you get to max level, but if you want to get the best items you have to do a bit more work. Additionally, when levels are added people expect new abilities because player levels indicate that your character has improved in some way, whereas item levels indicate that the item is simply better quality or more powerful. Its just a design decision. In FFXI, SE's previous game, they did not give items levels (there was no written ilevel) but certainly, as in all games, some items were more powerful than others. ilevel is just their way of giving us a general idea of the scale when it comes to which items are better than which. I don't think you can equate player level and item level in any way!

109,"MRD 15 gives you all the skills you need for tanking. The only skill you can still unlock for cross class is Mercy Stroke, which is nice but in now way required at all for pld. Its only available for like the last 15% of the fight anyway! I don't have it and have been able to do endgame content just fine. The only thing I can see it being useful for are things like Odin where the last few HP is a DPS race. If you are not hardcore then I would not bother leveling MRD any more for pld.

I don't have drg leveled, but since its a dps class I imagine mercy stroke is a lot more important for them.",2015-06-30 19:29:57+00:00,csnvko7,2.0,t1_csnrxju,5429.0,ffxiv

116,"Hunts are supposed to be hunted and searched for. I think that players actively hunting do generally make it on time for hunts, and a lot of time they pull because another hunt popped up that they want to get to in time. The majority of players who are missing out on hunts are the people who randomly hear a hunt shout and decide to go, but by that time the hunt has already been reported by all the hunt linkshells and people have already gathered. Hunt shouts generally happen a few minutes after the hunt is found because people first report to their friends and linkshells. Now I have only bee on time for one of the five hunts I've attempted to participate in (I don't have a hunt ls), but I think the only time we can really complain is if the mob is found and attacked as soon as it spawns - if the mob has been sitting there for an hour then its our fault for not hunting for it. I also think people need to shout when the mob is pulled. Its common courtesy to tell people its been pulled since there really isn't any point in coming at that point. Along those lines, I wish people who are tired of waiting would shout ""Pulling it in 1 minute"" or something like that.

Hunts should be like little events where they spawn with some mysterious guy driving down the trail with a caged hunt mob. People can see what the mob is but cannot attack. Generally the caravan reaches its destination in about 5 minutes. Then the mysterious NPC starts saying, in SAY mind you, that he will release the hunt in 5 minutes. I think that would be nice too, give some mandatory waiting time so people can show up - provided the mob is found right when it spawns ofc.",2015-06-29 16:12:42+00:00,csmhsae,1.0,t3_3bgb7d,59356.0,ffxiv

When ARR first came out, it was possible to skip a large amount of side quests and still get enough levels from MSQ and class quests to be able to continue and get to 50.

120,"My first thought was that they did this to prevent people from using Stoneskin to avoid getting stacks of certain debuffs which cause tank swapping... where with an 18% SS and a buff it was possible to solo tank these bosses because taking no damage would not apply the stacking debuff, thus completely bypassing the tank swapping mechanic. Ever since like 2.3 or so, SE has been trying to get away from ""tank and spank"" fights by introducing more tank mechanics. I imagine they don't want this to take away from that.
