There are also these strange looking huts and a lookout tower thing. http://theforestmap.com/screenshot/Evohunter88/2016-03-04-14-14-35-37681359.jpg/

When I first arrived here on day one, there were cannibal effigies around. Over the days I noticed that sometimes cannibals would hang out under the lookout tower. and basically just chill. The other day I woke up at night to strange noises and there were a bunch of cannibals over there praying. 

I have continually destroyed the cannibal effigies that they put up. Is this some sort of religious area for them? Can I do anything about this? I remember reading somewhere that rock walls are indestructible so I was thinking I wondering what would happen if I walled off this prayer site. Would the cannibals still come?

Also, are rock walls still indestructible? I was able to damage them with my axe but the cannibals didn't seem to hurt them.

Edit: So I ended up making a large rock wall around the outer perimeter of my base. It is 1 wall high, but I figured it was far enough away that cannibals wouldn't agro or have any reason to run and jump over it. The wall goes right through the prayer site. I have only spent about 10 nights at that camp (because I started a new base) but I have yet to be woken up by prayer since then. In the time that I am there, though, I notice a lot less activity there. It used to be that groups of 3 cannibals would visit there every evening/night but no longer see that happening.",TheForest,Native prayer site next to my base?,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheForest/comments/50u1xy/native_prayer_site_next_to_my_base/

I am in need of digital artwork for a board game I am creating which I intend to sell. I'm offering $300. I am not picky about the talent of the artist (both beginners or experts are welcome), and more concerned with how easy you are to work with and communicate with. 

There are about 15 unique cards I need art for. Here are a few examples of what I'm looking for:

http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/imperial-assault/images/3/3f/Portable_Medkit.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150825094319

I'm looking for an art style most similar to the first link. Cards would not include any text and would be things like Medkit, Chainsaw, Gun, Bullets, Running Shoes, Body Armor, Landmine, Moltov, various zombie cards, etc. The artwork for each card needs to be digital and sized 750x1125 pixels. 

As I said, this is for cards for a boardgame so the cards will eventually have text on them, but I want to get the original cards blank so that I can overlay the text on top, thus allowing me to change the text if there are any balance changes needed. Also, it is a board game so I'd be sending these images to a factory for them to print onto card stock and into actual physical cards.

So in I am looking to get the rights to do all of that - to modify the artwork by overlaying text in the appropriate areas, to make physical copies of the art as cards for the board game, and to sell the boardgame (of which the cards are a part). As I said above, I'm looking to pay $300 for all 15 cards (that is $20 per card).

All credit for the art will go to you. You will be mentioned in the rulebook as the artist who drew the cards and given full credit. I also would be willing to be a reference for you in the future if things go well.

This is my first time requesting commissions so I am not familiar with the common forms of handling the transaction of payment for art, but I am willing to work with you and use your preferred methods.",commissions,[REQ] Digital Card Art Request.,https://www.reddit.com/r/commissions/comments/5091w2/req_digital_card_art_request/

Is this how DS3 PvP is supposed to be? Wait for the other to attack and just parry until you get it right? I've stacked everything I have for armor and defensive rings and I cannot survive these one-shot critical hits.

I get that it is melee and you are in ""more risk""... I guess, but its actually a lot easier to get off attacks with melee and you don't get locked in animations for as long, so its easier to dodge. Am I doing magic wrong or is melee simply that much stronger? I can't imagine how much easier the game would be if I had that 40 points in strength instead of intelligence.

There were 4 people in my party and then there were a bunch of other people outside of my party. Everywhere I read about farming Hornet it always mentions having a party of 4 and doesn't mention anything about these extra people, so I assume it's not part of the generic hornet glitch/farm thing. 

Is it possible to take multiple parties into raids? Is this a glitch? Can anyone explain how this was done?
