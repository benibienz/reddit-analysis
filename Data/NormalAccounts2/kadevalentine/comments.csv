36,"This is exactly why talks like these are necessary. Some of you are acting like constructive criticism is the end of the world, or that this ONE article by this ONE person talking about things she personally has seen is the end of the world for you. 

Toxic femininity is a thing. Being an asshole is not relegated to the male gender. This particular article is about toxic masculinity, however. Specifically in the FTM community. Just because you personally might not have seen it - which I highly fucking doubt if you're in any of the FB groups - doesn't mean it doesn't happen. Especially when I'm here saying first hand that I have experienced it. 

Trans women do not hate transmen. Believe whatever lies you want, but know they're lies. Just because some of them may supposedly ""resent"" transmen doesn't mean you get to say that about transwomen as a whole. 

No ones telling you who to be. There are plenty of ways to be your own person without adhering to the toxic masculinity mindset. If you're a dick to women or feminine presenting trans/via guys, you're being a little shit. Don't be upset if people call you out on it. 

Femmephobia exists, too, on its own. Some trans guys will be rude to women simply because of their internalized self hatred or something. 

Don't complain about the usage of ""buzzwords"" when that's not at all what the problem is here. There's no problem with this article. She explains things fairly and at length. If you are pissed at this article, it's because you've seen something in it that upset you. Maybe you hate trans women. Maybe you hate women. Maybe you hate who you used to be and that affects you now. Who knows. Whatever your issues are, address them. ",2016-09-29 19:55:37+00:00,d87cevk,1.0,t3_54z5t5,75750.0,ftm

Everyone from all walks of life needs constructive criticism to help them be better at their jobs, at their art, or even as people. She's just remarking on the groups that she's seen. It's an open letter to people who think this way. She's not going to write an article on people who ARE better than this but that doesn't mean she doesn't think there are any out there.

Yes, there are people that teach FTMs to act like ""typical men"" in order to pass better. I've seen it in a lot of the FB groups I'm in, especially where they talk shit and put down the more feminine of the guys. I understand where they're coming from - I wouldn't want to wear makeup if I'm trying to pass as a guy. But that's just me not liking makeup in general. But these guys take it a step further. Whereas I don't understand it but also don't hate on anyone who does it, these guys will actively bully them for not adhering to their idea of masculinity. Which is toxic in either sex. 

Trans women don't ""resent"" transman. Maybe the fee the guy above me has encountered felt that way, but it's not as if resentment is something they just suddenly feel for us when they transition. ",2016-09-29 12:14:28+00:00,d86saze,2.0,t1_d86gwzi,31686.0,ftm

80,"I'm right there with you.  I watched All 4 One too, I liked that one. Even though her boyfriend turned out to be bad (they kinda made him a villain though, right?) she was still bi, so there was that little nugget. There's another show you'd like on their channel called Inhuman Condition. Fucking genius acting. And there was a black guy as a main character, which was great representation for me. 

But I feel you, and so do the others who commented. Us guys are there, we just don't talk about it because we fear that we're the only ones. And I know I couldn't post about it on Tumblr because 1, both Ellen and Steph, the creators of Carmilla, follow me. I feel like I would be disrespecting them. And then the lesbians would come after me, telling me I should be grateful they have a show. 

I don't know why I feel this way about Carmilla, when I absolutely loved Legend of Korra and wanted Korra and Adams together from the beginning. Granted I started watching it as a lesbian but now that I'm out as a trans guy I still love it. ",2016-09-17 13:31:52+00:00,d7qi74a,2.0,t1_d7q5oms,36755.0,ftm

You say I'm ripping them off but nothing there gives me over a $3 profit, including giving money to the designers each time a shirt with their design is sold. I sure as hell am not ripping anyone off. Thanks for assuming I'm trying to, though. Where I dropship the necklace, it was $6 so pardon me if I didn't think to look on AliExpress, a website I didn't know existed, to find it cheaper. 

I chose Shopify because it looks good and it's easy to use, plain and simple. I don't know what BigCartel is but I'm not about to switch and start everything over, especially since there's nothing truly wrong with Shopify. 

But the two main reasons you won't shop there is because (in your opinion) two things are overpriced and you think $5 is too much for shipping when it's actually $7.03 for first class shipping in my state? Now that doesn't seem fair at all. I even briefly advertised signing up for the store which gives a 2% discount on every item and a bunch more things that helps save people money.
