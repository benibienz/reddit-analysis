My girlfriend and I were both raised in incredibly abusive households. Of course with that being the case we both have respective mental illnesses. I got out - I left home once last year, came back thinking my parents would change, then decided to live with relatives. I got out. She, on the other hand, is still in. 

She has schizoid personality disorder. She medicated with weed which seemed to be the only thing that helped her cope. It wasn't a perfect solution, but it gave her a distraction. Yesterday, her father found her stash and took her keys, money, and turned off her phone. They won't even let her out to attend college classes. She was messaging me through Tumblr but her charger had been broken and it is perhaps dead now. She could be as well, and I would have no way of knowing. I'm hoping that isn't the case. 

Obviously, I need to get her out of there. Calling the cops isn't an option. Her brother has called the cops on them before a few years ago and they did nothing, much like when I called the cops on my own parents. Calling them again would solve nothing and only make things worse. 

I run a business and I'm working to help make money for that business. I know a few places we could stay for at least two weeks before moving on to the next. What do you suggest we do?

She wants a future she never saw before, and she admitted she loved me. (If you guys knew her, you would know how hard that is for her, on top of her SPD.) But it's really fucking painfully obvious that she prefers women, which fucks with me a lot even though she says she sees me as a guy. I think it's only natural for me to be wary and I wonder if anyone's gone through the same predicament.

A two nights ago I had a strange dream. It began with an owl coming out of nowhere and straight up beating my ass. At first I thought it was Athena being jealous that Morrigan has been taking up more of my time recently, but then I figured out it was a warning. 

Basically, Morrigan took the form of my girlfriend in my dream in an attempt to seduce me. I knew it was a guise because dream-gf let me kiss her neck and real-gf has a thing with her neck because of her PTSD. 

Today, I went to a New Moon drum circle. As I was sitting there intoxicated by the energies, I did a visualization/spell that if there was anyone there who needed to talk to me, they would. There were ravens fighting in the branches of a tree just above my head.  Minutes after I do this visualization, I meet a girl who seems to be the leader of a group of the two other girls with her. And this girls name, legally, was Morrigan. 

I don't think I have a problem that needs solving, I just felt like sharing Morrigan's little crush on me. ",Wicca,Weird few days...,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wicca/comments/4rayku/weird_few_days/

They're secretly a supervillain duo and hints are dropped every episode, but they're vlogging to try to have seem normal - aside from the fact that one of them is a vampire. 

I ask that you check it out, spread the word, and leave feedback here. There's only one episode so far - it's technically released at 17:00 on Saturday - and not everyone knows the real premise of the vlog. Most of the viewers only know that they're hiding something, but not what. We have between 10-13 episodes planned out and we hope to get enough of a viewing for our other work, too. We'll be having things like a gay talk show and several short films and webseries. We plan on doing a lot.
