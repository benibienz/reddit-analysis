0,Hillary Clinton did not run a centrist campaign. She ran an out and out progressive campaign. Appealing to white working class while paying lip service to people of color was what Bill Clinton did. Centering the marginalized is what Hillary did. It is ironic that people are now saying she should have returned to the original Clinton strategy.,2016-11-11 09:17:41+00:00,d9vn9ka,2.0,t1_d9vmeck,2613.0,hillaryclinton

&gt;Publication bias is the name of a well-known but hard to solve problem in academic research. A paper with a striking new finding is much more likely to be accepted at a top journal than a paper that says, ""I investigated an interesting hypothesis, but it turned out to be wrong."" This means that spurious findings — statistical coincidences and such — make it into the published literature, while boring null results don’t. This gives a distorted picture of reality simply because everyone is trying to be interesting.

I am bemused and amused by the discomfort people feel in talking about Hillary being a woman. As a woman, I think it is a BIG FUCKING DEAL. And I am going to talk about how a big deal it is. And I want Hillary to acknowledge how big a deal out is.

The rest will have to deal.

88,"There were plenty of voices on Twitter yesterday that dissented with the view that Clinton is a feminist choice. It gets me down too, but then the adjectives they use to describe her - capitalist, corporatist, elite, plutocrat, etc. make me realise that a) like every Clinton hater, their description of her is based on a caricature of her created by the media and b) these people belong to a way of thinking that I will never agree with (I don't see capitalist as an insult for example).


What really bugs me though, what really gets me down is that there have been 44 Presidents and feminism was never a requirement for them to hold office. It was nice to have. I mean even Sanders who said ""I don't ask people to vote for me because I'm a man"" gets touted by these people as a paragon of feminism. Sanders has  voted for war before. He has voted against gun control. He has voted for criminal reform. He barely even understands intersectionality - sometimes even rejects it. By their own standards Sanders fails the intersectional feminism test several times over. But it seems that the feminism bar for male candidates is really really low. So really, I find all these people criticizing Clinton because she does not meet some arbitrary standard of perfection while at the same time putting their blinders on while  gushing for male candidates to be hypocritical, irrational and self-unaware. There is so much cognitive dissonance in the far left it is painful to watch them flailing about trying to disguise their hatred in rational terms.",2016-06-09 02:00:31+00:00,d41rmb0,1.0,t3_4n6l44,26600.0,HillaryForAmerica

93,"http://time.com/4183108/obama-tampon-tax-sanitary/. 

From the article:
&gt;President Obama said the existence of a “luxury goods” tax placed on feminine sanitary products like tampons and pads is likely due to the fact that men wrote the laws in an interview on Friday.

Just one of the many thousands of reasons why it is important women who make up half the population should have their representatives in power.

Here is another article: https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/03/07/what-would-change-if-there-were-more-women-in-congress-more-than-you-think/
From the article:
&gt; For one, women are more likely than men to advocate for issues often associated with women’s interests — child care, women’s health, abortion, pay equity and the like. 

&gt; ...women are more likely to discuss issues in terms of women’s interests.

And here is yet another article which makes several arguments on how electing women into office is important:
http://www.vox.com/2016/6/6/11829852/clinton-woman-effect

Finally, I do not agree with the concept of gender blindness or color blindness. Arguably, being gender blind or color blind should help in promoting equality. The way it **really** works though, and several studies have shown this again and again and again, that all things being equal...it is the white males who get favored for a position. So no, gender blindness/ color blindness does not work in an unequal world. It actually leads to **more** inequality.

2. When voters decide who should be the nominee they also assess a candidate's electability. Where you live has nothing to do with whether you can fairly assess whether a candidate will be a good nominee.

They don't matter to Hillary supporters because we have looked into these issues and found:

 1. outright lies and obfuscation

 2. half truths and things taken out of context

 3. decisions which were compromises to achieve some good at the expense of some bad

 4. decisions and actions for which she receives an unfair share of criticism when compared to her her male counterparts (including her own husband)

 5. honest mistakes that happen to the most if us.


Most people don't look at Hillary in good faith. They start with the assumption that whatever Hillary does needs to be explained as a calculation. That is the frame in which they will then fit the narrative about her. This framing will never leave her.

&gt;Only twice in American history has a woman been a serious presidential contender; both times, that woman was Hillary Clinton. The paucity of data itself speaks volumes. Why don’t we have other women to compare Clinton to? Could it be because most women, facing the challenges that Clinton faces now, are not allowed to rise to the top tier of candidates? Is it because any woman powerful enough to run for president will quickly become undone by the image of power she projects? Are women simply hesitant to put themselves through the indignities that Clinton has suffered? I don’t know the answers, but the questions worry me. They suggest that no female candidate, however qualified, can ever be strong enough to fight back a challenge from a Sanders-type male rival.


It really makes me admire her so much more, because I believe she could have happily retired by now. But no, even after all the humiliation that she has faced she has come back to fight. She is [daring to compete](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35257086).

As far as I see, it was a category error. Most people have automatically associated certain things/people as good or bad. It is possible that Hillary's proximity with Reagan and her friendship with her had blurred this categorization in her own mind.

The reason many liberals were disillusioned with Obama was because they could not digest the fact that being President requires you to be a President not only of the liberals, but also of the conservatives.

""Standing firm on issues"" as you put it works only when you represent a small homogeneous constituency.

Ultimately though, the sudden shift of the United States to all liberal policies will not happen. Not under Hillary, and certainly not under Sanders. If anything Sanders with his uncompromising outlook may actually end up moving the country back to the right.

If you want a move to liberalism, it has to be gradual. When Bill became president, the country was even more conservative than it is now. Under Obama it has shifted further left.

There are two parts which stood out which show to me that who she is has remained remarkably consistent even when many of her views may have undergone huge upheavals:

* She was always careful and nuanced in her thinking. 


*In the bustle of her excursions, she showed the zeal of an emerging political junkie. And, while outspoken and often blunt, Ms. Rodham was hardly a bomb-thrower. She was, then as now, dedicated to cerebral policy debates, government process and carefully calibrated positions.*


*“Her opinions are mature and responsible, rather than emotional and one-sided,” Alan Schechter, a political science professor at Wellesley, wrote in a law school recommendation that year for Ms. Rodham.*


* She came to believe that gaining power was essential for bring about change.


*Beyond Mr. Alinsky, the treatise yields insights about its author. Gaining power, Ms. Rodham asserted, was at the core of effective activism. It “is the very essence of life, the dynamo of life,” she wrote, quoting Mr. Alinsky.* ",2016-02-27 17:04:04+00:00,d0fwzhz,1.0,t3_47sf1x,60072.0,hillaryclinton

388,"Firstly, you don't have to lean towards Hillary just because you are a woman. Many women do, but one doesn't 'have' to.


Secondly, feminism is a moment which has several goals, one of which is to increase women's representation in positions of power in government, business, science, technology, military and all such areas which traditionally kept women out.


Thirdly, the major reason why women are under represented in these areas is because of social and institutional sexism. You can see this play out in double standards applied to the way Hillary is reported about in the media.


A woman can vote on issues alone, if that is what she wants to do, but for many women pushing for representation is a very important goal. For many others, who have faced sexism in their own lives, Hillary's refusal to quit inspite of the relentless attacks she has faced over the past 3 decades is inspirational.


And of course, it also helps that Hillary is smarter, more knowledgeable and more prepared that any recent President.",2016-02-08 17:15:21+00:00,czsdixb,2.0,t1_czsc95n,1846.0,hillaryclinton
389,"Great post. I don't think there is anything wrong at all with voting for Hillary because one wants to see a woman president. You already make a great case for why women want to see themselves represented in government. 

Also:

1. Nobody really votes for anyone just for their gender. You want to vote for someone who closely matches your views first and then gender is just something additional that makes the case even stronger.

2. Most Presidents elected in the modern age are tall, handsome, charismatic, charming men. Many times they were not always the best people for the job. People choose who to vote for based on emotional arguments ALL the time, but when it comes to women wanting to vote for a woman they act as if it is a travesty.
