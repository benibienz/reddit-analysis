12,"Only changes EF needs is jungle and support.

Mid/ADC are fine. Keith just needs stronger support and decent coach to expain some positioning flaws.

- Top lane: There is a lot of time for KFO to improve his English even more. So he will become naturally even stronger. His mechanics are probably even better than Huni, but he has terrible decision making compared to Huni.

- Support: EF needs a support who can shotcall. Froggen can't keep doing this. He need focusing on improving roaming and while you are worried about shotcalling, you can't concentrate. If bunny still has skill, I would pick him.

- Jungle: Hard needs to go. He has skill of LCS, but he is not prepared mentally for LCS. He chokes way to fast. He probably needs go to CS to improve mentality and get stronger as well. Santorin is good jungler, he proved it this split. I would like to see him in EF.

14,Even this bad split EF were really close to win some games. They just throw'ed games against C9/TSM once. So it's already 3-15. If EF played like this against NRG/P1/Apex should be 2-0 sweep to. Maybe 1-1 with Apex. So EF would have 7-11 or 8-10 score. Some other games against liquid/Envy was really close too.

I have good experience with MSI cooling system for desktop GPU. So I thought maybe MSI has good cooling for laptops too.

37,"No 8/10 high rank players would say that you need be lucky to climb up. Don't get wrong, individual skill means something, but this is team oriented game. Look how pro players of rank 82+ loses to team who ranked 60-70 in competitive matchmaking... 

No matter how individually you are good, eventually your own skill will be not enough to climb up. You will need team help. The question is how much you can climb on your own? And in current rankings it is around 65rank. Above it you can't rely on your own skill.

Those other 2/10 people would deny everything what is said above just to feed their ego.
