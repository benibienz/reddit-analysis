Well, it has been. People stop at nothing when it comes to politics. CBI court summoned him, accusing him of criminal conspiracy.

&gt;&gt; Mr. Singh is accused of criminal conspiracy, breach of trust and criminal misconduct alongside the coal ministry’s most senior official at the time, P.C. Parakh; industrialist Kumar Mangalam Birla; and two other executives of Mr. Birla’s Aditya Birla Group.

&gt;&gt; “I am upset, but this is a part of life,” Mr. Singh told reporters in New Delhi. Declaring his innocence, he said, “I respect the judicial process in our country. I hope in any fair trial I will be able to establish my total innocence.”

&gt;&gt; Allegations of corruption involving senior ministers of Mr. Singh’s cabinet swirled in his final years in office. But even his fiercest opponents stopped short of making direct accusations against Mr. Singh, who is credited with ushering in broad economic changes in the 1990s, when he was finance minister.

&gt;&gt; The latest court order has changed that.

&gt; In 1986, the Hiranandani group signed a tripartite agreement between the group, Maharashtra state and the MMRDA for developing 230 acres of land and for constructing affordable housing. The contract was signed at the rate of ₹0.40 (equivalent to ₹4.00 or 5.9¢ US in 2016) per acre. As per the contract, the real estate developer was to construct apartments measuring 430 ft2 and 861 ft2 (50% each) as ""Medium Income Group Homes"" (affordable housing).

&gt; After a PIL was filed alleging violation of conditions, the HC directed Hiranandani to construct the smaller houses on remaining vacant land.

&gt; The HC, while hearing three PILs, had ruled that criminal cases can be filed against the developer and errant government officers

I am sure Mr.Hiranandani was not aware of these things and some junior engineer must have made a mistake. Then, they started encroaching on open spaces:

&gt; In a blow to Hiranandani Developers, the Bombay High Court has stopped the group's plans of constructing low- cost housing on land parcels earmarked as ""open space"" for eight societies constructed between 1995 and 2007.

56,"The article says:

&gt; Banks exercising write-offs is a unique idea to clear bad loan impacts on balance sheets. Banks use the RBI approved tool, Advance Under Collection Accounts (AUCA), in which transfer of accounts to a specific AUCA is an NPA reduction strategy. **It is resorted to after exhausting all avenues of recovery, restructuring and compromises.**

&gt; By writing-off bad and doubtful assets, banks can improve NPA ratios through cleansing of the balance sheet and tax benefits. All write-offs, except where one-time settlement or compromises are involved, irrespective of outstanding, should be treated as technical write-offs and parked in AUCA; recovery process of these accounts will continue till resolution of these accounts.

So while, as you put it, it will improve the balance sheets, the money is going to be let go off, because bank does not think its going to get it back. Apart from the few where there is a compromise/one-time settlement involved (But not the case with Mallya for example, who owes 1000+ crores to SBI).",2016-11-16 11:51:00+00:00,da2m5a9,6.0,t1_da2m1i1,319.0,india

If you actually do the math and are living with a partner, the cost of ownership actually works out to be quite reasonable. For short distances, tube ticket would be around £4.5. Uber around £5. Car? Well from £1-5, depending on distance and the day. I usually use it on weekends and parking is free then. 

So even if Zipcar and other options work out slightly cheaper, the overall convenience surely trumps the slightly higher cost.

&gt; To get these photographs inside the Maharaja’s Palace cost a bundle. There is the normal price of admission. Then, if you have a camera, that’s where you get nailed if you choose to take photos you can buy a one-day photographer’s license for about 5 times the cost of admission. Yes, of course, I paid it. This might be my only time to get inside such a piece of Indian history like this gorgeous palace. If I only had time right now to process all the great shots from this cool place.

&gt; Darlene, as I recall, the price of entry is 350 Rupees and to take a camera in it was an additional 500 Rupees. It worked out to something less than $20 US. My group really had a good time photographing here. It’s the Maharaja’s Palace in Bangalore. It’s very relaxed to visit without any crowd whatsoever. 

&gt; Yes it’s a bargain. There are other palaces that allow no photography. The royal palace in Mysore is where they have a metal detector like TSA uses. I was busted there with cameras in my backpack and never did get inside.

&gt; The ICT route is largely used by Indian IT companies in Britain and the UK's Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) had found earlier this year that Indian IT workers accounted for nearly 90 per cent of visas issued under this route.

&gt; The changes come just days before British Prime Minister Theresa May lands in India on Sunday for her three-day visit.

&gt; [On paper, electrified villages — in reality, darkness
](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/on-paper-electrified-villages-in-reality-darkness/article8397038.ece)

&gt; *The Centre claims to be fulfilling the Prime Minister’s plan for full rural electrification. But a close check of its own real-time data shows that the gap between official claims and ground reality is stark*

&gt; When this discrepancy was pointed out, a senior official of the Rural Electrification Corporation (REC), the nodal agency for rural electrification which functions under the aegis of the **Ministry of Power, said: “We put a lot of emphasis on photos. If there is a pole and distribution line visible in the photos, we call it electrified.”** This perhaps could be one of the reasons leading to the inflated number, as the presence of electrical infrastructure doesn’t automatically translate into electrification.

&gt; Bajrangi: Little time… We organized everything that night itself… We
mobilised a team of 29 or 30 people… Those who had guns, we went to
them that night itself and told them to give us their guns… If anyone
refused, I told them I would shoot them the next day, even if they
were Hindu… So people agreed to part with whatever cartridges and guns
they had… In this way, we collected 23 guns. But nobody died of
gunshots… What happened was this: we chased them and were able to
scare them into a huge khadda [pit]. There we surrounded them and
finished everything off… Then, at 7 o’clock, we announced…

&gt; Bajrangi: In Patiya, there is an ST [State Transport] workshop with a
huge wall beside it; next to this wall, Patiya begins… Opposite
Patiya, there is a masjid and beside it is a sprawling khadda… That’s
where we killed them all… At 7 o’clock, I called the home minister and
also Jaideepbhai [Jaideep Patel, VHP general secretary] and told them
how many people had been killed and said that things were now in their
hands… I don’t know if they did anything, though… At 2.30 in the
morning, an FIR was lodged against me… The FIR said I was there… the
police commissioner even issued orders to shoot me at sight…

&gt; Bajrangi: It was a huge pit… You could enter it from one side but you
couldn’t climb out at the other end… They were all there together…
They started clinging to each other… Even while they were dying, they
told each other, you die too, what are you going to be saved for, you
die too… so the number of deaths increased.


Particularly appaling: 

&gt; Bajrangi: Arrey hamari FIR me likha gaya hai… ek woh pregnant thi,

killed… I am no feeble rice-eater]**… 

&gt; didn’t spare anyone… they
shouldn’t even be allowed to breed… I say that even today… Whoever
they are, women, children, whoever… Nothing to be done with them but
cut them down. Thrash them, slash them, burn the bastards… Hindus can
be bad… Hindus can be bad, and I’m saying that because, as I see it,
Hindus are as wicked as those people are… Many of them wasted time
looting… Arrey, [the idea is] don’t keep them alive at all, after that

Quite often the ball hits the edge of the bat and keeper is supposed to catch it. That is what forces most keepers stand further back, so they get more time judge and see the ball. Dhoni has an incredible sense of judgement and reactions and is able to stand much closer, which of course makes these kinds of stumpings possible.  The other is how quick he moves after catching the ball. Most keepers move their hands slightly back to receives the ball (to dampen the blow), and then move to hit the wickets. Dhoni does not do that. His hands start moving to the stumps as soon as the ball is close to the gloves.

&gt; Unlike museums all over the world, NM does not have the policy of rotating art objects for display. Out of its total collection of 2.06 lakh art objects, only 7,178 have been displayed. Even in labels, in names and description of displayed objects, there were spelling errors aplenty.

&gt; **Of the 26 galleries in the NM, nine are closed for years on grounds like roof leakage, seepage and renovation.** The CAG said the NM has failed to furnish details for closure, tenure and expenditure incurred for renovation of galleries. For instance, manuscript library is closed since 2003 even after an expense of Rs 15.76 lakh and acquisition of 13 fabricated wooden showcases. Though Central Asian Antiquity gallery is closed since 2004 due to roof leakage, Rs 53.36 lakh was spent on infrastructure upgrade. Similarly, galleries of Tanjavur paintings, musical instruments, bronze, jewellery and tribal art are closed for years.

&gt; **The CAG found that conservation of antiquities is in a pitiable condition. The laboratory is conserving only 0.25% of the total antiquities of the NM.** Also, some antiquities were found lying in the laboratory for more than 10 years. Besides, there is no system of regular inspections in all the galleries and collection departments.

Talk to anyone who works in this field (and isn't a government officer). ",2016-10-18 00:38:03+00:00,d8wjhyt,8.0,t1_d8vthma,32425.0,india

One can say it is a vicious cycle because museums aren't good enough to attract people. But when was the last time most of us went to the biggest museum in our city? 

&gt; Perhaps the problem is that Indians are not interested in museums. Even a museum as accessible as the National Gallery of Modern Art at Colaba junction gets a footfall of just around 100 a day.

BM London gets 100 people in 10 minutes. ",2016-10-17 15:11:21+00:00,d8vs953,8.0,t1_d8vrvd8,513.0,india
209,"You name one. Any museum that comes close to a good international one. National Museum Delhi has leaking roof, uncategorised collection and curators don't know where half the stuff is. An example:

&gt; On July 2, rainwater had seeped through the roof of the 140-year-old building and flooded the galleries on the ground floor. Seepage had ruined four 19th century masks on the third floor. And earlier, in December last year, the priceless, 2,200-year-old Rampurva Lion Capital broke while it was being shifted from its gallery.

&gt; Other Indian museums are as bad or worse. A 2011 UNESCO report on eight large Indian museums had pointed out a long list of deficiencies, among them poor lighting and maintenance, incorrect signages and lax security. In 2012, a parliamentary committee report was scathing, ""Our museums are in a bad shape. **Only 10% of the acquisitions are put on display and those are not even rotated regularly.** Museum stores and galleries are in poor condition.""

What's the point of acquiring things when people can't even access them? These are the people managing things in our museums:

&gt; Pramod Kumar KG, managing director of Eka Resources, a company that helps plan and create archives, museums and cultural complexes, feels the problem is that museums are headed by bureaucrats who neither have any training in art history, nor an interest in the area. ""They may be in the agriculture department one day, and transferred to culture the next. What we need is an independent cadre of art historians/museologists to head our museums,"" he says.

International museums have people who have dedicated their lives to curating and exhibiting things. My sister is working on a massive collaboration between British Museum and Indian government for an exhibition in Mumbai next year. Many invaluable things will come to India for display. The level of organisation, professionalism, care and detail displayed by British Museum blew her away. They are so amazing in how they plan things.

A businessman actually bought and export license and spent his personal fortune in trying to save them from destruction. He went bankrupt doing so.

&gt; The Greek government has finally acknowledged that the British Museum is the lawful owner of the “Elgin Marbles”. That, at least, is the logical conclusion of the recent news that Greece has dropped its legal claim to the Parthenon Sculptures.

&gt; This is unsurprising, as — contrary to the widespread misconception — there was nothing illegal about the way in which Lord Elgin saved the Parthenon Sculptures from acute ongoing destruction. **The mauling had started when the Greek church smashed up a large number of the ancient temple’s carvings in the fifth century. The Venetians then blew up chunks of the building in 1687. And in the 1800s, when Lord Elgin arrived in Athens, the occupying Ottomans were grinding the sculptures up for limestone and using them for artillery target practice.**

&gt; Elgin had intended to commission casts and paintings of the sculptures, but when he saw firsthand the ongoing damage (about 40% of the original sculptures had been pulverised), **he acquired an export permit from the Ottoman authorities in Athens, and brought as many as he could back to safety in Britain. It was a personal disaster which bankrupted him**, but it has meant that, since 1816, the British Museum has been able to share with its visitors some of the best-preserved Parthenon Sculptures in the world.

Parthenon survived because of this guy. So this is like asking the legal owner to give something back. In our case, they just stole our stuff. ",2016-10-17 14:55:18+00:00,d8vrj4z,4.0,t1_d8vo47h,5003.0,india

&gt; The latter requires duly deliberated government sanction. The former is par for the course. Ever since the LoC was established decades ago, it has been left to the military to determine locally how best to respond to Pakistani provocations along (but not far across) the LoC. The surgical strikes undertaken by the Indian army in 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2013 were in keeping with these standing instructions. It would seem the Pakistanis decided to so treat the September 29, 2016 surgical strikes as there have been precedents for such strikes that went officially unacknowledged on both sides of the LoC.

&gt; What's more, 81% of men and 68% women said their affair has had a positive effect on their marriage. ""In some cases, an affair works as a wake-up call to repair the relationship,""

The case for the prosecution may be put on the basis that there is a very strong inference that the defendant was driving below the standard expected of a reasonable, prudent and competent driver because of, for example, the fact that a collision resulted.

It should not. If he did not break the law, he should not be punished. Another redditor commented about the bike in question:

&gt; Kim Briggs, 44, was crossing the street near Old Street on 12 February when she was involved in the crash.

&gt; Officers say the cyclist involved in the collision stopped at the scene and there have been no arrests made.

Can't see any specific details about how the accident happened. Some other forum mentioned that the bicycle was a 'carbon Planet X track bike'. Not sure how fast they can go. One eyewitness says:

&gt; The Reliance’s general manager Mario Assi, 45, told the Gazette: “She came from one of the shops, crossed the road and the next thing she is falling on the floor and the cyclist is falling as well. The cyclist got up but she didn’t move.

&gt; “I’ve known the area for years and you often get near misses with cyclists when crossing the road. It is so unfortunate. How often do you hear about a person getting hit by a bike and dying?

&gt; “The cyclist was so distressed and in such a bad way. He would have been going quite fast. It was just the timing, if it was half a second later or earlier she wouldn’t have died, I don’t think.”

430,"Sorry about that:

**UK financial sector targets Swiss-style deal for EU market access**

The City of London has given up hope of universal access to the EU single market and is now seeking a bespoke deal for its different sectors to trade with Europe, with similar but stronger ties than Switzerland.Teams across the City and Whitehall have been working over the summer to draw up a plan for Britain’s exit from the EU.


Officials and representatives from the financial sector are getting ready to present their policy ideas in time for them to be considered by the cabinet committee for Brexit, chaired by Theresa May, the prime minister, when it meets in early September, people involved in the preparations told the Financial Times.
The City has come to the conclusion that a deal for the UK to emulate Norway’s relationship with the EU is very difficult both politically and practically. Norway has access to the single market but no say in how regulations are set. It must both accept free movement of people and make budgetary contributions.
Instead, there is a preference for a unique trade deal, building on Switzerland’s arrangement.

A task force of grandees, chaired by Shriti Vadera, the chairman of Santander UK and a former Labour minister, is close to embracing this judgment. The group has already been provided one blueprint, a 110-page document prepared by the British Bankers' Association, advised by Clifford Chance and Global Counsel, the advisory outfit founded by Lord Mandelson, the Labour peer.

“There needs to be a bilateral deal providing as full two-way market access as possible,” said Anthony Browne, chief executive of the BBA, who has been part of Ms Vadera’s task force. “Both sides have an interest in making this work, as it is not in the interests of the other EU countries to be cut off from their main financial centre, especially at a time they are all seeking to boost economic growth.”
Mr Browne cited Switzerland’s trade deals with the EU that give some sectors, such as insurance, full two-way access to the single market via a so-called passporting deal in return for keeping its regulation at an equivalent level to that in the bloc.

Swiss banks do not benefit from any such trade deal, meaning they must do most of their EU capital markets business from their London subsidiaries.

But the City, which was overwhelmingly in favour of remaining in the bloc before the June 23 referendum, will argue that because the UK is the biggest export market for the rest of the EU it should be able to negotiate a beefed-up version of Switzerland’s arrangement.
Many financiers are reluctant for their ideas to be branded as “Swiss plus”, not least because Swiss politicians are frantically seeking ways to preserve their EU trade deals as they become increasingly contentious in Brussels.


Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange and a member of Ms Vadera’s task force, said: “European companies large and small as well as governments rely heavily on access to the UK financial services sector and the work of this committee is to look at the impact of the sector on the real economy.”

He added: “I do think that in a world where financial and business flows are deeply global and interconnected it is critical for passporting to be maintained and that requires some element of regulatory equivalency.”

Elizabeth Corley, the vice-chair of Allianz Investors and a member of Ms Vadera’s task force, told the FT: “What we want to do is make sure the way we move forward is joined up. We need to make sure that we leave the capital markets strong: this is vital both for consumers and businesses.”
The government’s official negotiating position will not be revealed until the end of the year but Mrs May wants informal positions to be ready in the early autumn in order to take “soft soundings” off Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland but also from key decision makers in Brussels, said people involved in the process.

Earlier this week, Michael Roth, Germany’s European Affairs minister, said that the UK could gain “special status” with the EU and have a bespoke deal. He repeated warnings, however, that the UK would not be able to “cherry pick” its position.
A likely obstacle to achieving the type of bespoke trade treaty that many in the City are pushing for could be an EU demand that the UK accepts freedom of movement of people from the bloc as a condition of keeping any single market access.

Given how passionately many Brexit supporters want to control immigration, they are unlikely to accept the type of arrangement that Switzerland and Norway have in effect accepted by joining the Schengen passport-free travel area.

The biggest fear for many City grandees is that financial services could face a “cliff-edge” moment if the UK leaves the EU without a trade agreement in place, cutting off access to the single market overnight. This has prompted some to call for a transition agreement to allow more time for groups to adjust.

There are fears that even if an acceptable deal is struck between the UK and Brussels, it could be scuppered if one of the 27 member states rejects it, as happened in April when the Netherlands voted in a referendum to rebuff a planned EU free-trade accord with Ukraine.Chris Cummings, chief executive of TheCityUK lobby group, said: “Business likes certainty and predictability and part of the deal will be ensuring a transition agreement so that supply is not interrupted — nobody likes power cuts.”

Financiers argue that it takes banks at least two years to move chunks of their business across borders — citing the time Bank of America took to move its vast derivatives book from Dublin to London. So they want early certainty that they will not face a moment in which their access to the EU market evaporates overnight.

They said that even if there were no gap between a new trade deal being agreed and implemented, big financial institutions will still need an adjustment period to update their IT systems and operational structures in line with the new arrangement.

Both the BBA and Ms Vadera’s task force — known as the European Financial Services Chairman’s Advisory Committee — have spent hours examining what access the City would have to the single market without a bilateral trade deal to replace EU membership.
They have found that many areas of the industry — such as cross-border lending and corporate deposit-taking — would be left without access to EU customers. Their work mirrors a parallel assessment being made by the Treasury.

There are some signs of tension between the BBA, Ms Vadera’s committee and TheCityUK, with each jostling for position as the main interlocutor with government. City grandees are also concerned that their views may struggle to be heard by both David Davis, the new secretary of state for exiting the EU, and Michel Barnier, the lead Brexit negotiator for the European Commission. Neither man is thought of as a fan of bankers and finance.

The BBA aims to publish several position papers on what Brexit means for banks, but Ms Vadera’s committee is unlikely to publish any official document, as it views itself more as a sounding board. Meanwhile consultants at Oliver Wyman are working with TheCityUK to examine the consequences for jobs and activity in the sector of various Brexit scenarios.

A Treasury spokesperson said: “We are actively engaged with the financial services sector and welcome its input as we prepare for the negotiations to exit the EU. Our position is absolutely clear, Britain remains open for business and we will work hard to get the best deal possible deal.”

&gt; Uber, which is available in 60 countries, charges a base fare of £2.50 as well as 15p per minute and £1.25 per mile. This is without ""surge pricing"", which increases the cost at times of high demand - on New Year's Eve, for example.

451,"&gt; To honor the legacy of India’s carnatic music legend M S Subbulakshmi, the UN will issue a stamp to mark her birth centenary next week, coinciding with the celebrations of India’s 70th independence day. The UN Postal Administration will issue the stamp to mark Subbulakshmi’s birth centenary, India’s Permanent Mission to the UN said in a press statement.

&gt; India’s independence day will be commemorated at the world body’s headquarters this year as Oscar winning composer A R Rahman will enthrall UN diplomats and international dignitaries at a special concert in the UN General Assembly hall on August 15. Rahman will be the second Indian artist after Subbulakshmi to perform at the iconic UN hall, which is the usual platform for global leaders to address the world.

&gt; Subbulakshmi, the first ever musician to be awarded India’s highest civilian honour the Bharat Ratna, was invited by the then UN Secretary General Late U Thant to perform at the General Assembly in October 1966, becoming the first Indian to perform there.

&gt; Earlier in March this year, the Pakistani mission to the UN had organised a concert by renowned singer Rahat Fateh Ali Khan to commemorate Pakistan Day at the UN.

&gt; India’s mission is also organising a photo exhibition from August 15-19 at the world body’s headquarters to commemorate Subbulakshmi’s birth centenary which falls on September 16.
This year also marks the 50th anniversary of her performance at the UN and the photo exhibition will depict various facets and moments of Subbulakshmi’s life and times providing a rare insight to the music legend’s achievements, the Indian mission said.

&gt; Minister of State for External Affairs M J Akbar will attend the events at the UN as well as those being organised by the Indian Consulate in the city. The events commemorating India’s 70th independence day are being organised by the Permanent Mission of India to the United Nations with the support of Sankara Nethralaya, an India-based civil society organisation.

&gt; “The United Nations is also celebrating its 70th anniversary this year. As India celebrates its 70th independence day, the event will emphasise that the wisdom of Indian traditions remains relevant to current global thinking,” the mission said, adding that the musical evening will provide a “glimpse of gaiety and dynamism” of India on the occasion of “India@70”.

&gt; The Indian Consulate will host a flag-hoisting ceremony on August 15 and India’s Consul General Riva Ganguly Das will ring the closing bell at the NASDAQ stock market in Times Square. Bollywood actor Abhishek Bachchan and Yoga guru Baba Ramdev will headline the parade in Manhattan, organised on August 21 by the Federation of Indian Associations of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut and considered among the largest in the US.",2016-08-12 09:08:05+00:00,d6ebtyz,1.0,t3_4xcn34,95.0,india

&gt; The parameters for the survey included behaviour, politeness, willingness to learn the local language, trying local delicacies and spending on the local economy. Indians are least likely to attempt to learn the local language, try out the native delicacies and are also very stingy when it comes to tips. They are also said to be rude and untidy. 

&gt; Indians also don't have a good standing when it comes to following basic rules related to noise, hygiene etc. Says Pavan Varma, director, ICCR, 

&gt; ""Indians are a hesitant lot when they have to tip at hotels or restaurants,"" adds Akhtar. As a airhostess with a leading airline adds, ""Sometimes, you come across Indian travellers who are looking for a freebie and consider service staff as menials.""

When we landed in Bangkok, they behaved as if this was a nation of prostitutes, even hitting on the women behind the immigration counter. The men travelling with their wives were no better than the rest—a 50-plus man from Jaipur went crazy shooting pictures of women in traditional off-the-shoulder tops, often trying to hug them, while his wife looked on meekly.""

&gt; **The Ugly Indian**

&gt; For those schlepping bags and serving drinks, though, the Ugly Indian can be so demanding that the lifeline sometimes looks like it has a noose at the end of it.

&gt; “It’s a cultural thing,” said Pankaj Gupta, part-owner of Outbound Travels, a New Delhi-based travel agency. “In India, we have servants to do everything in everybody’s houses mostly, so people are just sort of used to getting stuff delivered to them.”

&gt; **How rude are we?**

&gt; You board an international flight, smile at the thought of a relaxed, well-deserved break and close your eyes as you await take-off. Your peace is shattered in seconds, thanks to a bunch of loud, aggressive co-passengers. From fighting for space to stove their cabin luggage in the overhead compartment to asking for exchange of seats, they literally demand attention. There's no respite from the cacophony until you reach your destination. 

&gt; Sounds familiar? Indian tourists are perceived to be lacking in etiquette, so much so that several travel agencies hand out a list of dos and don'ts along with tour itineraries.

&gt; Entrepreneur and frequent traveller Puja Sahney is not surprised. “The behaviour of a section of Indian tourists has come in for criticism in Europe and South East Asia. I have visited Thailand at least seven times and with each visit, I notice how Thai nationals are increasingly hostile towards Indians. **We have brought this on ourselves. It's embarrassing when a hotel manager tells you that it takes the house keeping staff 40 to 45 minutes to clean a room vacated by Indians as against 17-20 minutes for others.”

I am Indian. Born and brought up. Still speak English with a desi accent. Eating *Paneer paratha* as I type this.

I have a positive bias for Indians because I am one. I try to give benefit of doubt. Like, in my comment above I said I totally know that this behaviour stems from the lack of our resources. Brits or anyone would behave the same way when they grow up in an environment and condition like ours. But this underlying reason does not detract from the fact that many of us do behave poorly.

Yes.

This is changing a lot. But that is one reason why a lot of Westerners are not as exposed to us or our behaviour, and this allows us to be lower down the list. Your link has Americans as number 1.

Usually the photographer gives you a right to 'use' the photos, so you can print/share them.  Buying the copyright has more charges involved. UK specific, but it is similar in most countries:

&gt;&gt; The reality is that a professional photographer will never hand over copyright to their images and those that say they do are probably keen amateurs trying to turn their hobby into a bit of extra cash. The phrase ‘copyright free’ should be a warning that the photographer doesn’t really know what they are doing. Professional photographers always retain the copyright to their images and instead will licence them for various uses.

Haahahah! Sorry.

In 6 hours I can churn out 100 such agreements, no exaggeration. The changes are that minor. Just fill in the blank in an existing template. And they don't even put any effort in trying get it right. My experience so far in the current flat:

- First renewal: Never sent me a copy with landlord's sign despite repeated reminders. I contacted him directly and got it done 2 months later because I need it for the visa. 

- Second renewal: Sent me a copy with a lower increase rent than what they discussed with the landlord. 2 months after I (happily) signed and sent it back, they tried to tell me 'oops, it is higher'. Now if I did not like the raised rent, technically my landlord could boot me out the very next day as the contract was over. Thankfully I have access to my landlord, so I wrote to him and he really gave it to them. They waived my renewal fee for my troubles. 

- Third renewal: After I signed and sent back the contract, the copy they mailed to me did not have landlord's signature. Seems like a trend.

- Fourth renewal: Told me that my landlord wanted the rent raised by X%. I agreed as I did not want to negotiate, since he is a nice guy and did not increase much the last time. By chance spoke to the landlord around that time and he had no clue about this because he never suggested an increase! 

Oh, and another estate agent manages the development. After repeatedly asking for parking permit I stopped and am parking without one. They literally just need to post one! When I lost my building access fob, I had to chase them for replacement despite providing my landlord's approval on day 1. Then the person I was dealing with went on a holiday, and the replacement asked me for landlord's approval again. Then they sent me a fob which worked on the main entrance, but not on my building's door. Again chased them over email. Finally wrote a mail cc-ing all the top bosses and managed to get my fob the next day. A week later the lady I was initially dealing with writes to me apologising and asking me which building I stay in so they can update their records so this does not happen again; lol wut? Aren't you guys 'managing' this development? So should you not know based on my flat number?

484,"I am guessing you want to stand out so you get more work. First, let me say that increased competition does not necessarily mean less chances of getting work. The market itself has expanded. There are more opportunities than ever before. I had never heard of pre-wedding shoots earlier. Now, recently I did a 'babymoon' ([haha, yes they call it that](https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=babymoon)) photo session for a couple who came for a holiday.

&gt; With so many candid photographers out there, how does one innovate to stand out of the crowd?

To specifically answer this, the quality and consistency of your work would put you ahead of lots of your competition and will make you stand out. Attention to detail is important. Anyone can slap a filter on, but not every tries to get every single detail right. Keep reading and watching what the leaders are doing, keep learning, keep experimenting. I still feel I hardly know anything when I look at the work of photographers I admire. You also need to break the way your mind thinks: *it gets very conditioned to think a certain way if you only focus on one genre*. I shoot a lot of other stuff to learn/find ideas which I can apply to weddings/portraits. [Like I did this shoot for someone where I learnt and experimented with smoke-bombs](http://i.imgur.com/oRvKeEp.jpg). I later used this idea for an engagement shoot.

About getting work, the best way is through references. As they say, happy customer is the best advertisement. Besides this, you need to innovate and little and network, like any other business. I have a few ideas in mind that are in the pipeline that will set me apart from my immediate competition.

513,"&gt; I don't know which specific airports you found bad in India, I have always had a worse time in US and UK airports. In Heathrow I feel like a rat running a maze. 

Heathrow is one of the world's busiest airports, handling almost twice as much traffic as IGI Delhi. So of course it is spread out. But I have never found the walk uncomfortable or too long. 

&gt; grumpy looking officials who bark orders at you and always sound like you're testing their patience.

I fly out very frequently and have not had 1 unpleasant experience. Officials are firm and curt, but never impolite. Some of the others are nice and friendly. At least they are professional. At the Indian airport one official told my father in law ""Oh you have two girls, no son?!"". Imagine that. They always have a bunch of idiotic comments especially since my wife and I have an inter-religion marriage. Just do your job and give me my passport!

&gt; The glass panels add to it and make me feel like I am being watched by psychiatrists.

The panels are on the front, but you stand on the side/edge, where there is no panel. So when you talk to them, there is no glass between you two. Not sure why the glass would make you feel strange though. Those are there even in banks, movie theaters etc.

&gt; In India, by comparison, I just have to pass one counter.

One counter in UK as well. Which other ones did you cross?

&gt; The lines are long, yes, but it's orderly.

Aren't the lines more orderly in the UK? If there is anything these guys know well, it is how to queue. 

The best thing I like about Heathrow is that for their own citizens they have a different queue. They have biometric passports, so citizens just scan those themselves through the gate very quickly, without dealing with any official. In India, everyone is lumped together.


&gt;  I don't get the feeling that I'm guilty until proven innocent.

&gt; However, figures showed that the remaining local officers were routinely sent away to deal with protests and major events in central London.

582,"More info:

&gt; The ramshackle house, which has survived a century of wear and tear and a devastating earthquake in 1934, retains little of its old architectural charm. The large battered wood panels jutting from the tiled roof, a small family well and a house number etched on the wall are the few mark the crumbling edifice.     

&gt; Orwell, né Eric Blair, was the second child of Ida and Richard Walmesley Blair, who worked as sub-deputy agent in the Opium Department of the Indian Civil Service. A massive opium warehouse faces the house, where Orwell spent just one year. Two photographs exist: one of him in his mother’s arms [and another in his ayah’s](http://i.imgur.com/l9UBF57.jpg).  Besides that nothing is known about the family’s life in the district that borders Nepal. “Of all the biographies and articles written about my father, little has been said in relation to his birthplace. This is simply because he left at the age of one. Nevertheless Motihari is a significant part of his story; everything written about him starts at Motihari,” says Richard Blair, Orwell’s son, via e-mail.


His father's 'opium' connection is interesting as well because Motihari is part of East Champaran district, a region from where in 1917 Mahatma Gandhi launched the civil disobedience movement that ultimately resulted, 30 years later, in the departure of the British from India. Gandhi had been moved by the plight of cultivators in Bihar who were being forced to produce opium and indigo for the lucrative markets of China and Europe respectively.

&gt; The house would have turned to rubble were it not for a campaign by a Motihari businessman, Debapriya Mookherjee, to convert it to a memorial.

&gt; ""The people of Motihari do not realise that even if Orwell was an Englishman, he was anti-imperialist and wrote against colonial exploitation,"" said Bishwajeet Mookherjee. ""I made the film to educate Biharis about Orwell, to tell them that a great writer was born in my home town. It's only right that we should honour his memory.""

If I had moved to another part of India, lets say the South, I would have done the exact same stuff and I would have had to make the same kinds of adjustments. 

People who find it hard to integrate in another country will find it hard to integrate in another part of India as well.

Depends on which western country you are in and which city you live in. I live in London and for the first 5 years we did not even bother buying a car. Public transport and walking was enough to get everything done comfortably. Pretty much everything I need is within 15 minutes walking distance, including the western version of a *chat* shop (local coffee house and pubs). There are at least 20 Indian restaurants. Just see the place where I hang out:

Plus everything is so rich in history, like my home city Delhi, but way better preserved. My [neighbourhood pub was built in 1585, and is now owned by Gandalf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grapes), and the neighbourhood charity that I volunteer with was established in 1100's. 

I feel like I 'belong' here because I put in the effort to integrate. I met my neighbours, volunteered and did not insulate myself by surrounding myself with only fellow Indians. Now we have lots of Indian friends and many others of different nationalities. Best of both worlds!

What we miss are our families and around major festivals. London still has a lot to offer because there is a massive Indian community here.

One reason for my attitude could be that I grew up in India where religious symbols are all over the place. The country is secular as defined by the constitution, but unlike for example in France where all religious symbols are discouraged, in India they allow/treat all of them equally. 

&gt; Western notion of Secularism (Dharm nirpekshta) emerged out of the struggle between the Church and the State for supremacy in public sphere of life (1400-1600 AD). The state eventually won that struggle and the subsequent notion of Secularism that emerged was: A wall of separation between the state and the religion. The state was to govern the public sphere and the Church was banished and limited only to the private sphere of human life. 


&gt; Indian notion of Secularism (Sharva Dharma Sambhava), it emerged out of the need of Indian independence struggle. Gandhi needed an idea of secularism that work in highly religious society like ours and at the same time, it should not antagonise any religion (so that all religious community participate in Independence struggle), hence Indian Secularism is equality among all religions.

&gt; ""786"" is the total value of the letters of ""Bismillah al-Rahman al-Rahim"" (""In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful""). In Arabic there are two methods of arranging letters. One method is the most common method known as the alphabetical method. The other method is known as the Abjad method or ordinal method. In this method each letter has an arithmetic value assigned to it from one to one thousand. This arrangement was done, most probably in the 3rd century of Hijrah during the 'Abbasid period, following other Semitic languages such as Phoenician, Aramaic, Hebrew, Syriac, Chaldean etc.

&gt; If you take the numeric values of all the letters of the Bismillah, according to the Abjad order, the total will be 786. 

&gt; In the Indian subcontinent the Abjad numerals became quite popular. Some people, mostly in India and Pakistan, use 786 as a substitute for Bismillah. They write this number to avoid writing the name of Allah or the Qur'anic ayah on ordinary papers.

&gt; Taken as a whole, the research on pictorial warnings show that they are: (i) more likely to be noticed than text-only warning labels;3,4,6–8,10–12 (ii) more effective for educating smokers about the health risks of smoking and for increasing smokers’ thoughts about the health risks;7,10 and (iii) associated with increased motivation to quit smoking.3,6–9

&gt; Cognitive and behavioural indicators of label impact that are predictive of quit intentions and quit attempts (e.g. forgoing cigarettes because of the labels; thinking about the health risks of smoking) increased to a greater extent among smokers after the Australian pictorial warnings were introduced than they did in the United Kingdom after enhanced text-only warnings were introduced.6 

&gt; Pictorial warnings are also cited by former smokers as an important factor in their attempt to quit and have been associated with increases in the use of effective cessation services, such as toll-free telephone “helplines”.9 Although all warnings are subject to wear-out over time, pictorial warnings have also been shown to sustain their effects longer than text-only warning labels.7,8

Extremely relevant point that we don't think of:

&gt; **Pictorial warnings may be particularly important in communicating health information to populations with lower literacy rates.1,2 This is particularly important considering that, in most countries, smokers report lower levels of education than the rest of the population. Preliminary evidence also suggests that countries with pictorial warnings demonstrate fewer disparities in health knowledge across educational levels.**

Let's start with preserving what we have with us right now. 

&gt; Last month, the Archaeological Survey of India wrote to the Union Culture Ministry about two invaluable pieces, a 2 BC Yakshi statue and a 3 BC Mauryan lion, at Kolkata’s Indian Museum that had been irreversibly damaged. The ASI said the damage was caused by careless handling and warned that the museum would die if the callous attitude continued.

&gt; This was at India’s oldest museum, which turned 200 last year. But the dismal state of museums, especially government ones, is no secret. In 2011, UNESCO published a scathing report on the appalling conditions at India’s top eight museums, citing sub-standard maintenance, lighting and signage, among other issues. But at the core are deep-rooted issues of archaic policies, lack of autonomy, and no skilled manpower. Our excellent collections are proof of a rich socio-cultural history, but when museums act as mere closed-door guardians of treasures instead of disseminating them, attractively and intelligently, to a wide audience, they lose their purpose.

&gt; The peninsula called the Isle of Dogs was originally known as Stepney Marsh. Some of the marsh was drained in the 13th Century, and in the latter 14th Century a chapel was built to serve the spiritual needs of the small agricultural community which had grown in the area. This way of life came to an abrupt end in 1448 when the embankment keeping out the river was breached and the land reverted to marsh.

Well, not really. And 38 is not that old either for a keeper. Alec Stewart played till 40, Nehra is 36. As long as he is fit and good enough for the team, this question does not even arise. Who will replace him?

He may be under pressure, but we did not do terribly in this tournament despite so many players failing, and Dhoni was not one of them.

*Why* does the journalist think Dhoni should be considering retirement? He is fit to play, is still winning matches for India, is a very good keeper and a great captain. Should he consider retirement because we lost in a semi-final? So this question itself is a bit absurd.

&gt; Navroz is a day of celebration. Apart from new clothes, all Parsis wear their gold or silver kustis and caps. Auspicious symbols like fish, birds, butterflies and stars, are patterned on doorways with metallic moulds. Guests are welcomed with a sprinkling of rose-water and rice.The most traditional drink for Navroz is falooda, which is prepared with milk and flavoured with rose water.

&gt; Jamshed-e-Navroz is a time for Parsis to reiterate their identity in India ’s melting pot of religions. For many Parsis, this festival also ushers in the new year. It is on par with Gudi Padva and Ugadi, which are also new year days in India.

&gt; Food forms an important part of their festivities. The most traditional drink during this time is falooda prepared from milk and flavored rose water. They also have ‘Ravo’ for breakfast which is prepared from suji, milk and sugar.

&gt; People visit Fire Temple or Agiary for a special thanks giving prayer called, 'Jashan'. After the ceremony people greet each other by saying, 'Sal Mubarak'.

905,"&gt; That programme was then emulated all across the country.

This is not true at all. I worked on the pulse polio campaign myself and travelled all over India.

That wiki article is a fluff piece. Read the linked citations. None of them credit him. Pulse polio program was being implemented across the country, national government was committed to it on an international level, and HV helped that program in Delhi, like other CMs in other states.  Harsh claims he started it in 1994, but this source contradicts his claim:

&gt; Similarly, following WHA resolution, Tamil Nadu and Kerala states conducted State-wise polio vaccination campaigns in 1993/1994 also. Delhi state of India, conducted first state-wide polio vaccination campaign on October 2, 1994, followed by another round in December 1994. The Government of India joined global polio eradication efforts and the first two National Immunization Days (NIDs) for poliomyelitis eradication in India were conducted on December 9, 1995 and January 20, 1996.

&gt; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4078488/

Even for the national government program, they had been working on it since 1990.  The citation for the line which talks of him 'overseeing', does not even mention him:

970,"I am going to broadly talk about wedding photography to give you a better idea of what it takes.

* It is not just about photography: A lot of the work is networking, approaching people, pitching ideas and basically being out there. To get to a place where work comes to you on its own, you need to first establish yourself. Just like any other business, here also you will need to make 'cold calls'. You will have to embrace social media, create a facebook/instagram account, always looking for people who would work with you. I have a very active social circle, so I have been able to get work through them. I am also a part of photographic groups, that allows me to collaborate and experiment. You need to be out there!

* Practice, Practice, Practice: If you're new to photography, then you need to invest a lot of time and effort into taking pictures. Even if you think your images are shit, don't give up. I still think a lot of my images are shit. After shooting for so many years, I still think I know very little. I learn something new every week. 

* Post processing is very important: You will have to learn Photoshop/Lightroom. There is no photographer who does not use it. It looks bad when overdone, but to achieve perfection in an image, you need to adjust it. This has a big learning curve, but isn't difficult. You just need to devote time. Also keep in mind, that the 'filtery' look that you personally might not like is what the market demands right now. So you will need to adapt your taste a little to get paid work, till you're established and develop and independent style (I am still trying to figure out mine).

* It is a lot of work: This should not dissuade you in any way. But shooting a wedding is a physically tiring job, and requires planning. After the shoot, there is a lot of time spent in post processing. I recently did  a maternity  shoot and I spend 4 hours on one image which I wanted to edit in a specific way (experimenting). Usually it takes from between 5 to 30 minutes per image for me. Sometimes I redo them. I am just trying to set your expectations; you will be working more than just those 6 hours at the wedding (longer maybe for Indian ones).

* Equipment makes a difference: You won't get shots like the top photographers because equipment makes a big difference and this is something a lot of people do not want to admit. Yet, you can take good pictures with some basic stuff. 

* Basic equipment: Get the cheapest DSLR (Nikon or Canon). You can even look at second-hand ones. Spend the rest of your budget on lens etc. Get a 35mm prime. Buy an external flash (3rd party like Nissin), spare battery and memory cards. With these you can begin to take wedding photos.

* How to start: Do it for a family or friend first. Don't be the main photographer, just do it on the side as a guest. See if you can get enough good images. Share the good ones with your friend/family. If you use facebook, post to facebook and tag friend (take consent before). Don't post all 300 you click. Shortlist to 100 which you will send and post only around 10 best ones. Look around for people who are looking for student photographers. Work for them for free. This will help you learn without much pressure and will also give you images for your portfolio.

I think I have covered most of it. If you have questions, please ask.

See the rates people in India are charging:

Absolute amateurs get around 10K. People who are even slightly good, get away with around 25K. People who have a body of work to show charge 25K for 4 hours for pre-wedding, which is the most relaxed kind of shoot.

The problem is, this is a great thing to have on the side. But the work does not come to you all the time. I get around 1 good paid project a month. This isn't sustainable, till my work grows enough for me to get at least 4-5 projects a month. That will take time, effort and investment.

1005,"I don't remember which one I shared. Price depends on what they want really. Initially, when I started doing it I was pitching pretty low to get work and experience (you don't want to fuck up someone's wedding when you are paying you really well! Yes, you don't want to fuck up at all, but more money = more pressure); around £250 for 4-6 hours. That amount isn't worth the time/effort if you only do it for the money and don't enjoy it, because overall it works out to be £15 an hour. I'd rather just relax at home with my wife.

Now I get a bit more. But since this is something that's on the side, I am flexible about stuff that interests me. Like today I was asked by someone to shoot her wedding in Italy, in a village close to Florence. I had done their 'save the date' in London and she really liked the work. She already has a photographer there, but wants me to come as an additional, but will only cover the costs of travel and lodging* for me and my wife (my wife came for the last shoot and all of us got along really well). So I am quite tempted, even though it won't really make me any money!

None really, to be honest. Both of us are very liberal and she is my best friend. Families are pretty easy going too. We celebrate both festivals with as much enthusiasm. Living out of India makes it less about religion and more about doing something 'Indian'.

That is what I was saying. The London restaurant I was comparing Delhi restaurants to, aren't like Udipi either. They are trendy places. So I am comparing apples to apples, while you're comparing them to oranges and saying, no Delhi has cheap places.

Of course Delhi does have cheap and good places. Like Sagar Ratna, Haldiram (amazing consistent quality), Noodlebox etc. Delhi has tons of great street food places too. But we are talking of trendy places in London and Delhi. In those, you end up paying almost the same or at least a comparable amount. So yes, Delhi *is* expensive. Maybe because real estate in Delhi's popular places is also comparable to world's biggest cities. 

Read this when you get time to see how prices have risen:

&gt; As restaurant cheques in India compete with those in London, Singapore and New York, there's no stemming the country's growing appetite.

&gt; Now, pause to note how middle-class India’s notions of “value for money” have changed: Think back and you may recall how Shangri-La kicked off its India operations with its Sunday brunch priced at about Rs 2,200. This was two years ago and the meal was one of Delhi’s most expensive. In 2008, in fact, this is the price the more “reasonably” priced ones command — at standalone restaurants.

&gt; Talking of the rise in restaurant prices, Manu Mohindra, the country’s leading consultant for restaurant projects, recalls, “When Shalom started its Rs 1,000 a head buffet six years ago, everyone screamed. But there were takers. Olive came at about Rs 2,000 per head and people screamed. Now, at places like Ai, you’ll still pay 4,500 a head for dinner.”

&gt; While there is no study available on how much prices have risen, it would be safe to peg it at 25 per cent, an exceptional rise, if you take into account the business worldwide — in markets such as the US, prices have seldom risen, and never by as much. While Mohindra puts the leap as “12.5 per cent every six months, so, 25 per cent annually,” KPMG’s Raghu Venkat Narayan says

This is not there in upscale restaurants alone. Anything trendy tends to match the prices. Please do not give examples of Haldiram, which has great food but zero ambiance. I am talking of places that have the same level of service and ambiance as a good restaurant in London. 

When you talk of cheap eats, of course Delhi will be cheaper as it should be.

1152,"Delhi is one of the oldest and most historic cities in the world my friend! To quote Dalrymple: 

&gt; Of the great cities of the world, only Rome and Cairo can even begin to rival Delhi for the sheer volume and density of his­toric remains. For miles in every direction, half collapsed and overgrown, robbed and re-­occupied, ne­glected by all, are the remains of 600 years of trans-­Indian ­imperium—all that is left of the vanity projects of ­centuries of Delhi’s emperors. Walled gardens and crumbling palaces, thousand-pillared halls and mighty tomb towers, empty mosques and semideserted Sufi shrines: there seemed to be no end to the litter of ages.

Delhi's famous landmark Qutub minar was built in 1200 AD (UNESCO World Heritage Site),  Humayun's Tomb 1500 AD (UNESCO World Heritage Site), Purana Qila 1500 AD, Red Fort 1600 AD (UNESCO World Heritage Site),  Tughlaqabad Fort 1300 AD (though in shambles now), Jama Masjid 1600 AD (largest mosque in Delhi and can fit 25000 people), Jantar Mantar 1700 AD (for anyone who loves science!). 

Modern would be stuff built during the British period, which itself is quite fascinating like Rashtrapati Bhavan, India Gate, Lutyen's area. Even modern structures like Akshardham are worth visiting. Plus, the food and the general chaos of Old Delhi which seems frozen in time, the bazaars...Delhi is a must visit for anyone who loves history.

1198,"&gt; What happens to donations if you don't achieve your goal?

Unlike some other fundraising platforms, Milaap allows the campaign to access whatever has been raised. Donors can ask for a refund though, before Milaap disburses the money. Alternatively, if the campaign gets cancelled, the money gets refunded to the contributors.

The money required by coaches is 3 lakh and we are raising 1 lakh. The idea is to help them with whatever amount we can. So even if we raise 50K, I don't think we should cancel the campaign, and we should just transfer that money to them.

&gt; Do we get some kind of a receipt or status update on what happens to our donations?

Milaap reminds and encourages fundraisers to provide updates about their campaigns. In the previous campaign that I ran, they contacted me, and sent a few emails reminding me to thank the contributors and tell them what happened. Once I had helped the person, I posted the update with photos on the campaign page.

This is what we should do here. What I had in mind was to get the recipient to take a 'thank you' photo which mentions the amount they received. This along with a receipt from Milaap, confirming the transaction, should be enough I guess to confirm that they money has indeed gone to the coaches.

They will not be able to build the ring right away with this money. So we were thinking of asking them about how they will use 1 lakh if they were to receive it and then follow up with them to see how they used it.

Any other ideas and suggestions are totally welcome.

1239,"&gt; You should give her a hint that you are not interested 

But OP has been giving the opposing hints:

&gt; Hell once i even asked her about her sex life 

I am not a prude, but I have never ventured into this direction with my bhabhis even though I can say that as relatives we are quite close. This isn't something you'd discuss unless you're extremely close, which usually does not happen with your brother's wife (just the nature of relationship is such). Not sure why OP would even inquire about it. 

&gt; Then i said i would like to get married to a girl like you. 

Err...okay. Borderline flirting, but lets give him the benefit of doubt.

&gt; I did eventually gave her some answers and here you can fault me because some of the things that i said were about her physical body.

Boom.

If this story is real, then I feel he showed interest and she reciprocated. Now he is feeling guilty and wants to pin all of it on her. This particular line reminds me of an incident:

&gt; Of course i meant it as a joke but she took it quite seriously. 

In college a few of us friends were at my lady classmate's dorm room. Her roommate was there too. As a part of the conversation, one of the guys 'jokingly' told the roommate that they can go to the other room for some alone time. 

She very vocally refused saying 'I don't want to sleep with you'. A little taken aback by the flat refusal, he laughed sheepishly, ""I was just joking"". 

""You would not be joking if I had said 'yes' would you?"".

So, the honest fact is that almost always such jokes are never entirely jokes but more like a trial baloon; testing the waters to see what you can get away with.

1370,"Subsequent governments did not do a good job, but you can't take away the fact that Rajiv Gandhi did start the computerisation in India and was committed to it. His 'vision' in this regard should be appreciated, whether you like his politics or not.



&gt; 'I knew from the beginning that we had to inoculate some politicians from IT opposition,' he says. In this, Seshagiri and the other IT-savvy bureaucrats were lucky to meet Rajiv Gandhi, who was much younger than other political leaders, and just forty years old when he became prime minister. Trained as a pilot for the Airbus A320, Rajiv was generally unafraid of technology. 'He was a thinkerer,' one bureaucrat who worked with him tells me. 'He was always curious about how new technologies worked.'

&gt; Rajiv's attitude to the role of computers in governance was shaped early on by the Asian Games, which India hosted in 1982. Rather typically, the ministry of sports dragged its feet on the project, and six months before the Games nothing had been done. Within the government, the panic was similar to when you opened your text for the first time the night before the exam. The project was handed over to Rajiv, and he and his team of bureaucrats got it running in the little time available, wiring it together with IT.

&gt; The prime minister was an island of support for these efforts in a sea of opposition. **Sam was accused by some in the left of being a CIA agent, and the 1984 IT policy ran into choppy waters almost immediately. Bank employees burnt effigies of computers, and the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, the BJP-affiliated trade union, observed Labour Day in 1984 as 'anti-computer day'.**


&gt; Rajiv's idea of electronification 'as a tool for the removal of poverty' attracted wide disdain -- the consensus was that these guys had their heads in the clouds and were out of touch with India's problems.

Hyperbolic on her part but not entirely untrue. Why do you think naxals exist? One day tribals woke up and decided to pick up guns instead of farming?

People get shunted out, without compensation or rehabilitation, all in collusion with the politicians and *babus*. Empathising with their plight and trying to understand the reason, and calling the systematic exploitation is not sedition.

Out government *has* been terrible in the past. We are one of the few who bombed their own civilians^1 using Air Force. How many people know of this? So calling this an evil crime would be sedition?

&gt; So, at 11:30 am on March 5, the air force attacked Aizawl with heavy machine gun fire. On March 6, the attack intensified, and incendiary bombs were dropped. This killed innocents and completely destroyed the four largest areas of the city

&gt; Locals left their homes and fled into the hills in panic. The MNA melted away into surrounding gorges, forests and hills, to camps in Burma and the then East Pakistan. The air force strafed Aizawl and other areas till March 13.

&gt; This was the first— and only — time that the air force has been used to attack Indians in India. It cleared Aizawl and other cities of the MNA, but did not finish off the insurgency, which would last for another 20 years. 

&gt; Till the 1980s, the Indian military stoutly denied the use of air attacks in Mizoram in 1966.

1378,"&gt; The long-simmering animosity between them Gandhi and Rushdie boiled over in a High Court in London when Indira Gandhi sued Rushdie for libel. Gandhi won her case demanding an expurgated, revised version shortly before she was assassinated.

So she proved in court that Rushdie was incorrect? Why he lost:

&gt; He should have had nothing to fear, but **Rushdie unfortunately had made a quite serious miscalculation by using real names--names which the general reader would assume were not arbitrary but rather signified real people in a real India.** What the court had to decide was whether Rushdie had expressed a false assumption that Sanjay Gandhi had accused his mother of causing his father's fatal coronary by neglecting him. No one had witnessed such an accusation, and by the time of the trial no evidence could be obtained from Sanjay and Feroze Gandhi since they were both dead. It was Indira Gandhi's word against Salman Rushdie's. 

&gt; The court's verdict was for Gandhi. Rushdie and his publisher, Jonathan Cape, had to apologize publicly to Gandhi, promise to remove the libelous passage in future editions of the novel, and pay all court costs. Rushdie, then, was legally brought to his knees. 

I found this particularly mature of her, considering the fact that she had so much power in India: 

&gt; Indira Gandhi's libel suit against Rushdie was peculiar and limited in nature. She made no attempt to ban Midnight's Children in India, nor did she seek legal redress for Rushdie's portrayal of her in Saleem's nightmare. Rather than suppressing this direct frontal assault on herself, what Indira Gandhi sought damages for was a brief passage - just one sentence, in fact - that is no longer to be found in the paperback edition of the novel.

1451,"You said Waqf land, and I specifically asked about temple land. But none the less, let me explain why temples get taxed. 

According to Income Tax Act, income of charitable or religious trust is not taxable (this includes temples). Donations to them are also exempt. But they need to show and prove that they used their income for charitable purposes otherwise their income is taxable. Guess what? People managing bigger religious bodies do not want to disclose how they used their money. To claim the benefit on income more than 1,80,000 they need to get their accounts audited by a CA, but they don't because they do not want to make their accounts public. 

Now Waqf board has a deeper level of government interference (Central Waqf Council is headed by an IAS who reports to the Minister of Minority Affairs). So all their income and expense is audited. Waqf by law can not do anything else but charity from its income. So they keep publishing their records, getting audits done and they keep enjoying the exemption. The temple you linked could have legally not paid tax, but that would mean telling the government where the money came from and where it went. 

&gt; Central Wakf Council, India is an Indian statutory body established in 1964

Central Waqf council was established later to regulate and allow government to interfere into waqf. It brought all the independent waqf boards under a single umbrella. This is like saying cricket did not exist in India before BCCI came around. Before CWC, state waqfs acted like local/independent charitable institutions. Wakf existsted even in British India. If you want to read you can download this for example:

* [Colonial State and Muslim Institutions: A Study of Developments in Waqf Law in British India](http://www.academia.edu/1526989/Colonial_State_and_Muslim_Institutions_A_Study_of_Developments_in_Waqf_Law_in_British_India)


&gt; Waqf is the backbone of financing of the likes of Owaisi.

How does Waqf specifically benefit him? Corruption finances all kinds of people. This is like denouncing Air India because that enables Owaisi to get from one place to another. Similarly Waqf also helped Ambani build Antilla. It is the same for any religious body where funds get misused or misappropriated. 

&gt; how much of it has actually been donated by attributable owners?

All of it. Because they actually have land and monetary records of each. You do not understand how big their entire system is. They specific records for each item. From the source of your own quote:

&gt;&gt; As per the report of Sachar Committee (2006) there are about 500,000 registered Wakfs with 600,000 acres (2,400 km2) land in India, and Rs. 60 billion book value.

They have everything audited and on record. Considering the fact that you chose to omit this, I am getting a feeling that you're deliberately being obtuse, so I will not waste my time. ",2015-10-13 19:23:51+00:00,cvyhfoe,10.0,t1_cvyggsu,1343.0,india

&gt; Wakf land was given by default of partition. 

No. Source? Waqf has existed way before partition.

&gt; Wakf land is mostly composed of religious non-belonging. Wakf has no business selling graveyards.

Totally untrue. Waqf land is all over the country and consists of religious and commercial land. Whether Waqf chooses to sell the graveyard or not, that is their matter because they own it.

I am not watering down in the least but it is clear that you either have zero clue about the subject, or have been mislead by reading some propaganda.

1461,"It is probably because you're not from the economic/cultural/ethnic group which sees it this way? From the article: 

&gt; For several female participants in the study, being a cyclist – or choosing not to be one – was very much entangled with concerns and convictions about femininity, appearance and their inclusion in a highly visible minority transport culture – a sort of club. 

&gt; One, Rachel, new to cycling, described uncertainties about what to wear: “I swing between, should I go all in Lycra or should I go for a more girlie look.” Others recognized the dilemma but felt they handled it quite comfortably, and some fully embraced the cyclist look: “I’ve got the kit, I’m a cyclist, yeah.” There was also outright rejection: “The women that do cycle are probably more blokey than feminine.”

&gt; The common theme was that, one way or another, cycling entailed personal negotiations with notions of femininity, whether accepting them, challenging them or accommodating them.

If instead of homosexuals, BJP opposed marriages between some other kind of minority, like Sikhs for example. Would /r/India vote for it in the name of development? No, because we identify Sikhs as 'us'. This would be seen as an attack on ourselves.

Is their cultural identity playing a role? For example, maybe some ethnicities consider cycling to be a 'poor' person's activity while others relate it to affluence.

&gt; That these choices might, to some extent, be culturally determined is suggested by data from London travel diaries. One-day travel diary data is taken from the 2001 London Area Transport Survey (LATS) and three years (2005-2007) of the London Travel Demand Survey. These show that rates of cycling differ by gender, ethnicity and household income (Table 1). 

&gt; In London, around a third of cyclists are women, in contrast to cities in countries such as the Netherlands and Denmark, where women typically make more journeys by cycle than men (Garrard, 2003). More strikingly, in a city where more than one in three residents belong to a minority ethnic group (Bains &amp; Klodawski, 2007), 86% of male cyclists and 94% of female cyclists identify themselves as White (Green, Steinbach, Datta, &amp; Edwards, 2010). Cyclists are also more likely to come from more affluent social groups, with on average 1.5% of those living in households earning under £15,000 cycling, compared with 2.2% of those living in households earning over £35,000 (Green et al., 2010). 


Here is the full study:

&gt; Funded by TfL and NHS Camden, it examines in-depth interviews with 78 Londoners: women and men of assorted ethnicities, cultural backgrounds and occupations, some of them cyclists, some of them not and some of them thinking about taking cycling up.

1537,"It was in 1987. The famous Roop Kanwar case. 

&gt; On September 4, 1987 in Deorala, a nondescript village in Rajasthan, 18-year-old Roop Kanwar burned to death on the pyre of her husband Maal Singh. Dressed in bridal finery, Roop Kanwar walked at the head of the funeral procession to the centre of the village and ascended the pyre. The family lit the pyre fully aware that she was sitting on it, alive, with hundreds of onlookers watching the proceedings. In fact, relatives even fed a thousand people in honour of 'Sati Mata'. 

&gt; Based on a petition by women activists the Rajasthan High Court, on September 14, 1987, ordered the state government to prevent a function glorifying sati from taking place on the 13th day of Roop Kanwar's death. The ceremony was nevertheless held with much fanfare. A festive 'chunari', taken round in procession, draped over a trishul to resemble the form of a woman, was set ablaze in the presence of VIPs, politicians,
legislators and thousands of people. Cries of "" Sati Mata ki jai ,"" "" Jab tak suraj-chand rahega, Roop Kanwar tera naam rahega "" (""As long as the sun and the moon exist, Roop Kanwar will be remembered"") rent the air.

&gt; The Sati Dharma Suraksha Samiti dropped 'Sati' from its name and
organised a massive rally, mid-October, in Jaipur. People carried naked swords and shouted slogans in favour of sati and Roop Kanwar. Similar rallies were organised in the districts of Alwar and Sikar. Under the ordinance, 22 criminal cases pertaining to these rallies were filed for 'glorification of sati'. On October 11, 1996, the additional district and sessions judge at Neem-ka-Thana in Rajasthan pronounced all 32 accused, including Roop Kanwar's father-in-law, 'not guilty' with regard to the immolation. They were acquitted. The main reason for their acquittal was stated to be the absence of eyewitnesses to the immolation, which took place in the presence of hundreds of onlookers. **In fact, the court declared that the prosecution had not been able to prove that Roop Kanwar was alive when she sat on the pyre and was burnt to death!**

&gt; The court's finding brings us to the acquittal, on January 31, 2004, of all the accused including former minister and vice-president of the state's
BJP Rajendra Singh Rathore, former Bharatiya Yuva Morcha president and nephew of vice-president Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, Pratap Singh Khachariawas, president of the Rajput Maha Sabha, Narendra Singh Rajawat, former IAS officer Onkar Singh and advocate Ram Singh Manohar in four of the criminal cases under the 1987 ordinance. 

&gt; The other striking feature of the case is the turning hostile of senior government officials including police officers. In what is probably unprecedented, ADM Nar Hari Sharma, SDM Gyan Prakash Shukla, SHO Bhilwara Satish Kumar, SHO Nagar Nigam, Jaipur Chagan Lal, amongst other
ASIs and constables, all changed their testimonies in court and refused to support the prosecution launched and conducted by their own administration.

&gt; **As time for an appeal with the high court runs out, continuing protests within the state and across the country have failed to persuade the state government, headed by Vasundhara Raje, to file an appeal against the acquittal and take steps to conduct, with due care and diligence, the prosecution of 18 cases of 'sati glorification' still pending trial.**

In 1911, Sophie was fined by the courts for refusing to pay taxes due on her five dogs and man servant. The courts also impounded her diamond ring and auctioned it off.

1539,"National drink of Turkey is Raki, which is alcoholic (and delicious). 

&gt; http://www.raki.com/raki.asp

The way Islam is interpreted now considers alcohol totally unacceptable. It was probably not like this always. Famous poet and polymath Omar Khayyám wrote extensively about wine and love, as did the legendary Sufi mystic Rumi.

&gt; The relatively relaxed attitude to alcohol in the earlier centuries of Islam may have been due to doubts, in the days before the religion had hardened into rigid orthodoxy, as to whether the Qur'an actually prohibits the consumption of alcohol or merely recommends moderation and/or abstinence. Some hadith (traditions of the prophet) even suggest that Muhammad may have actually drunk mildly alcoholic beverages. 

That's why you see lots of wine in old Mughal paintings. If you go to museums you see a lot of  royal [wine cups](http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/w/shah-jahans-jade-cup/) from that time. 

Secondly, a word can have two meanings. Saqi in name could mean provider, like that poetic meaning. *Wali* in urdu means saint.

1541,"When Nehru and Ambedkar were trying to modernize Hinduism, this group called them the enemy of their religion. The 'modern' Hindu Law is a fruit of the sustained efforts of those two. They came up with stuff like this, which was unthinkable at that time in India: 

&gt; For our purposes, it is enough to summarise the major changes as follows; (1) For the first time, the widow and daughter were awarded the same share of property as the son; (2) for the first time, women were allowed to divorce a cruel or negligent husband; (3) for the first time, the husband was prohibited from taking a second wife; (4) for the first time, a man and woman of different castes could be married under Hindu law; (5) for the first time, a Hindu couple could adopt a child of a different caste.

&gt; These were truly revolutionary changes, which raised a storm of protest among the orthodox. As Professor Derrett remarked, ""every argument that could be mustered against the protest was garnered, including many that cancelled each other out"". Thus ""the offer of divorce to all oppressed spouses became the chief target of attack, and the cry that religion was in danger was raised by many whose real objection to the Bill was that daughters were to have equal shares with sons, a proposition that aroused (curiously) fiercer jealousy among certain commercial than among agricultural classes"".

Now the very same group feels proud of what the 'enemies of Hinduism' managed to achieve. These things were not inherent to Hinduism at that time. They were forced by some truly visionary people. Guess who were the main opposers?



&gt;  **In the vanguard of the opposition was the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. In a single year, 1949, the R. S. S. organized as many as 79 meetings in Delhi where effigies of Nehru and Ambedkar were burnt, and where the new Bill was denounced as an attack on Hindu culture and tradition.**

&gt; A major leader of the movement against the new Bill was a certain Swami Karpatri. In speeches in Delhi and elsewhere, he challenged Ambedkar to a public debate on the new Code. To the Law Minister’s claim that the Shastras did not really favour polygamy, Swami Karpatri quoted Yagnavalkya: ‘If the wife is a habitual drunkard, a confirmed invalid, a cunning, a barren or a spendthrift woman, if she is bitter-tongued, if she has got only daughters and no son, if she hates her husband, [then] the husband can marry a second wife even while the first is living’. The Swami supplied the precise citation for this injunction: the third verse of the third chapter of the third section of Yagnavalkya’s Smriti on marriage. He did not however tell us whether the injunction also allowed the wife to take another husband if the existing one was a drunkard, bitter-tongued, a spendthrift, etc.

Even Dr.Rajendra Prasad opposed the bill and many failed attempts were made to pass it. But there was such strong opposition that they had to stop. 

&gt; Ambedkar even resigned from the Cabinet in disgust, saying that Nehru had not the ""earnestness and determination"" required to back the Bill through to the end.

&gt; In truth, Nehru was waiting for the first General Elections. When these gave him and the Congress a popular mandate, he re-introduced the new Code, not as a single Bill but as several separate ones dealing with Marriage and Divorce, Succession, Adoption, etc. Nehru actively canvassed for these reforms, making several major speeches in Parliament and bringing his fellow Congressmen to his side.

&gt; In 1955 and 1956 these various Bills passed into law. **Soon afterwards Ambedkar died. Speaking in the Lok Sabha, Nehru remarked that he would be remembered above all ""as a symbol of the revolt against all the oppressive features of Hindu society"". But Ambedkar, said Nehru, ""will be remembered also for the great interest he took and the trouble he took over the question of Hindu law reform. I am happy that he saw that reform in a very large measure carried out, perhaps not in the form of that monumental tome that he had himself drafted, but in separate bits""**.

&gt; Bhikaji Cama was also a prominent suffragette and ardent socialist, actively campaigning for gender equality and Indian independence. Born in Bombay in 1861, she came from a wealthy Parsi business family and attended the Alexandra Native Girls Institution, one of the best Indian schools of the time. She was married at the age of 24 and, as this union was an unhappy one, Bhikaji spent much of her time involved in social work and helping women less fortunate then herself. She became particularly proactive in campaigning for a free India.

&gt; In 1902, Bhikaji applied herself to helping victims of the Bubonic Plague and contracted the dreaded disease herself. She survived, but was left weak and physically vulnerable. Her doctors advised her to travel to Europe until she had recuperated. While in London, Bhikaji was able to reinforce her belief in the equality of the sexes and became involved with the suffragette movement. The strength of the women she met and their belief in the possibility of change fed her resolve to continue her campaign for an independent India. She held regular meetings at Hyde Park, India House and, as her strength grew, became a highly influential figure to many other Asian and British suffragettes and free India activists.

1567,"More about him here:

&gt; Lionel Walter Rothschild was a rich, eccentric and determined character who dedicated his life to the study of animals. His private collection formed the foundation of the Museum at Tring.

&gt; At the age of seven, Walter - as he preferred to be called - declared to his parents that he was going to 'make a museum', and began to establish himself as a collector.

&gt; By the age of 10, he had amassed a collection of specimens including beetles, butterflies, birds, fish and mammals. At 18 he moved to Cambridge to study natural sciences, and for his 21st birthday his father gave him money and land to build the museum Walter had first declared would be his some 14 years earlier.

&gt; In 1892, at 24 years old, Walter opened his museum to the public. It remains one of the largest private natural history collections ever assembled.

&gt; Walter employed dozens of collectors who travelled the world to bring back new specimens for display and research, and live animals for study and breeding. He was particularly fascinated by cassowaries and giant tortoises, and even trained zebras to draw his carriage.

&gt; Following Walter's death in 1937, the building and collection were gifted to the nation and became part of the Natural History Museum.

&gt; So how did this spoilt princess, goddaughter of Queen Victoria, become a doughty fighter for women’s rights? Her turbulent family history influenced her greatly. 

&gt;  Perhaps even more than the protagonist, it is the character of her father, the Maharajah Duleep Singh, that best portrays the relationship between the Indian aristocracy and the empire. Duleep’s mother was imprisoned for refusing to acknowledge British rule.

And you can read more about Indian suffragettes here:

&gt; As Sophie grew, her social life and connections flourished and she joined the WSPU, becoming an active campaigner and fundraiser for women’s rights. She was also a member of the Women’s Tax Resistance League and made many appearances in court for non-payment of taxes. She strongly opposed the injustice of making a woman pay taxes when she had no right to vote or voice her opinion on how those taxes were spent. In 1911, Sophie was fined by the courts for refusing to pay taxes due on her five dogs and man servant. The courts also impounded her diamond ring and auctioned it off. However, the auction was attended by many women’s right campaigners. One of these was a Mrs Topling who purchased the ring and promptly returned it to Sophie.

&gt; Bhikaji Cama was also a prominent suffragette and ardent socialist, actively campaigning for gender equality and Indian independence. Born in Bombay in 1861, she came from a wealthy Parsi business family and attended the Alexandra Native Girls Institution, one of the best Indian schools of the time. She was married at the age of 24 and, as this union was an unhappy one, Bhikaji spent much of her time involved in social work and helping women less fortunate then herself. She became particularly proactive in campaigning for a free India.

&gt; In 1902, Bhikaji applied herself to helping victims of the Bubonic Plague and contracted the dreaded disease herself. She survived, but was left weak and physically vulnerable. Her doctors advised her to travel to Europe until she had recuperated. While in London, Bhikaji was able to reinforce her belief in the equality of the sexes and became involved with the suffragette movement. The strength of the women she met and their belief in the possibility of change fed her resolve to continue her campaign for an independent India. She held regular meetings at Hyde Park, India House and, as her strength grew, became a highly influential figure to many other Asian and British suffragettes and free India activists.

""The unwarranted disclosure of matrimonial plans by two adults may in many situations jeopardise the marriage itself. In certain instances, it may even endanger the life and limb of one or the other party due to parental interference.""

&gt; Can you tell me more about special marriage act? How much time does the whole process take?

First you need to start by seeing if you have a valid address proof for the house you're living in. They accept voter card, passport, ration card. If you are from another city and haven't changed these, then you need to get it done. I got a ration card made, which in itself was a pain in the ass (I had passport and voter card, but they were for my 'permanent address' not where I was staying at that time). 

Then my wife had to make a special trip to India so she could sign the marriage application form and so we could apply for it (we wanted to do everything by the book, no fake signs etc.). After several *chakkar* of the district court, I got fed up. No one gives you accurate information because they want to make money off you. Even to give those free forms, they ask for a bribe. so I told my dad to handle it. After *danda* from the top, things moved smoother. We were given a date for 2 months later. They put up our names and photos on the notice board outside District Magistrate's office^1. They also send a letter to your families which you need to bring with you. The guy there offered to hand it to us, instead of posting, in return for money. They were constantly asking for '*mithai*' (sweets). I think this act is mostly used by inter-religious marriage, and they know that such couples are anyway under pressure, so they try to fleece them as much as possible.

No one object to our's so we could get married 2 months later. If someone had objected, they would have been given 1 month to prove to the court that their objections were valid. Imagine, you have all your preparations done, venue booked, guests flown in to the city, and one day before someone objects. 

Anyway, on the day of the marriage, we reached the court on before the designated time, along with witnesses and few friends/family. They were running a bit behind schedule. The place is like a typical government office. You enter the DM's chamber, sit in front of him while they check your papers. Then they make you sign the marriage register and pronounce you husband and wife. Another guy scurries off to prepare the marriage certificate (asks for *mithai* before giving it to you). You really do not feel like you got married. I have attended civil marriages in the UK, and the registrar here actually talks about importance of marriage and makes you feel the importance of the occasion.

Anyway, we had 5 days of traditional celebrations and functions planned, so we did not care. We only cared about getting the paperwork out of the way.

1610,"&gt; There is a piece of legislation called Special Marriages Act 1954. People should read that before converting for marriage.

That law also makes it very difficult to marry. Shahi Imam obviously is doing it for religious reasons, but if you were irreligious then common sense says that you should just convert and get married for the sake of your sanity. Only idealism makes you use Special Marriages Act. 

From my other comment today:

&gt; See they don't ask you to convert, like the Muslim law does not ask you to convert. But you have to be a Hindu or a Muslim to marry using either of these laws. So people *have* to convert, unless they use special marriages act. 

&gt; Now special marriages act is quite tedious to use. You need apply in advance and take a date. Provide lots of documents. Then they send letters to girls and boys homes. You need to bring those letters to be married. They also put up your names on the notice board, and anyone can object to the marriage. Then that person is given a hearing. So, if you don't want to convert and get married, it is more difficult! How crazy is that!

&gt; Rajahmundry: In a bizarre show of sycophancy, Congress leaders in West Godavari district tied doves to Diwali rockets which they then fired into the air at Kovvur on Saturday. They were ostensibly welcoming AP Congress president N. Raghuveera Reddy who had come to attend some local programmes.

&gt; As part of the welcome programme arranged by West Godavari Congress president, Md. Rafi Ulla Baig, Congress workers placed two doves in two cones made of chart paper and tied them to rockets which they fired into the air.

&gt; It is not known whether the doves escaped or suffered burns from sparks from the rockets or perished when the rocket exploded.

&gt; Reacting to this, Animal Welfare Board of India honorary animal welfare officer P.B.K. Aharyulu said, “The culprits should be booked under Section 11 of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 2001.

That comment was written as a specific response to the situation the OP was in, and wasn't intended as a general discussion of that debate.

Yet police need to test the powder to have all the facts in place for the trial. Was it gunpowder or not? If it was, then who supplied it? How did murderer find out about it?

My father empathises with tenants a lot because we lived in a rented place for a very long time. He is totally non-interfering, does not bicker over stuff and even discounts the rent. He became cautious after my distant *mama ji* had to sell off his property for peanuts because the tenants.

**Edit**: Just the available facts without any conjecture or hearsay:

* Police claim that victim was trying to gatecrash and assaulted them first.

* Yet the police only charged her with a fine of Rs.1200 section 110 (abatement if person abetted does act with different intention from that of abettor). If you ever hit a police person, they will not let you off that easily, so that is surprising. 

* The video only shows victim being assaulted. She did not react against them in any way in this video.

* TimesNow also claims that the Mumbai Police refused to record victim's complaint.

* CM has ordered an inquiry. 

**Edit 2**: Thanks /u/1581947 

* 2 women police constables have been suspended (according to the translation of the [marathi report](http://www.loksatta.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-police-beaten-up-a-devotee-at-lalbaugcha-raja-two-lady-constable-suspended-1145630/)).

* ""There was much more that happened than the assault seen in the footage. The cops took me to the police station and brutally assaulted me with lathis; I still have the marks on my back. The way they dragged me by my hair was humiliating and my head still hurts,"" Nandini alleged. 

* She was told that you should not complain or your career will be affected. She alleges she was beaten in the police station too. Her interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EyrBCMgjNk

* Although the incident had taken place around 11 pm on Friday night, she was only allowed to leave the police station around 3 am, after they had slapped a Rs 1,200 fine on her and charged her with creating nuisance in a public place under the Bombay Police Act.

1814,"This is a very good article that calls Ankit out. Quite amusing to read:


&gt; For a very long time, I’ve despised you as a charlatan. There used to be a time when I thought you a script kiddie, or a skiddie if you will. You know what comprises those types—plagiarists who pass off software programs developed by others as their own. That is why on every forum that matters, I’ve rubbished your credentials as a hacker of any merit. I’ve openly accused you of shameless self promotion. 

&gt; And each time you appeared on television shows or in print as one of the most prominent experts on computing and security in the world, I’ve laughed my backside off. I told everybody who cared to listen you’re nothing but a bag of gas, whose reputation was built by shoddy journalists that eagerly lapped up the tall stories you doled out. 

&gt; Like I told you the other day, I thought it impossible how the books you’ve authored until now could possibly have managed to sell 25 million copies. I thought it completely ridiculous on your part to claim you were contacted by American “intelligence agencies” for help to decipher an encrypted email sent by Al Qaida operatives post 9/11.

&gt; But after an email interview and five hours of talking the other day, all I have to say is mea culpa. You are perhaps one of the smartest 27-year-olds I’ve met in all my years in journalism. And I’m willing to bet every rupee I have you’ll go a very long way because you’re twice as smart as CEOs I know who are twice your age—and that you are exponentially smarter than I am.

1823,"They did promise internal transparency and democracy when they formed the party and asked for donations. So many people would want to hold them accountable to that. They are free to come out and admit that they will no longer be able to do this, instead of pretending that there is democracy inside. 

Maybe it is impossible to run a party with total democracy, just like you can't run a company. But then they need to acknowledge that their idealism isn't feasible. 

I do not hate AAP but I do feel that the dream that was AAP is technically dead. AAP is just another political party in the arena. They might be more honest than others for now, but then they have also been in politics for the least amount of time, so have not had a chance to get jaded. Let us see how things pan out in the coming years.

&gt; which I think they were able to do.

In some cases and then they did not in some others. Anecdotal: My friends and I have been trying to get some work done in our constituency. It has not happened at all. Simple stuff like stopping water from clogging. I understand that BJP runs the MCD, but at the end of the day I will hold my MLA accountable too. My friends still do not know of any local *sabhas*/meetings that were promised. On the upside though, it was very easy to arrange a meeting with the MLA and he was empathetic. But work still has not been done. *Aise mein voter kya kare?* This is exactly the situation AAP had promised to change.  ",2015-09-26 10:29:11+00:00,cveolqc,5.0,t1_cveohk6,581.0,india

1825,"&gt; AAP is easily by far 

Not so convinced by this. On paper this was probably true before they actually won. But now you can see that AAP also has its failures. In less than a year it has also managed to disenchant a lot of supporters because of their policies and internal politics. No way of knowing how they will emerge 4 years from now.

What I will agree is that AAP is a good choice to have around to put pressure on INC and BJP. They have their flaws, like other parties, but they have some good stuff too. The AAP experiment has also shown everyone how difficult it is to be idealistic in politics. It was easy for AK to sit outside and criticise everyone, but only now does he probably realises the compulsions of everyday politics, how easy it is for others to accuse, how difficult it is to get work done etc.

1835,"Not long ago. Till 2005 daughters did not have the same property share, yet BJP never championed that cause and never rallied to have a UCC to fix that.

Why do Hindu business laws exist? Why do Hindu adoption laws exist? Why not talk about dissolving these when the UCC rhetoric comes up? It is nothing but hypocrisy from them and their supporters. I want UCC, but I do not want BJP's bigoted version of it which rides on the back of their petty politics.

&gt; BJP and other Hindu outfits today

Today is a key word which underlines their hypocrisy. Those outfits ideologically fought against reform of Hindu society, but were whipped and tamed by Ambedkar, Nehru &amp; Patel. So in their ideology they do not want social progress, but it is more out of vindictiveness. Read:

&gt; &gt; In the vanguard of the opposition was the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. In a single year, 1949, the R. S. S. organized as many as 79 meetings in Delhi where effigies of Nehru and Ambedkar were burnt, and where the new Bill was denounced as an attack on Hindu culture and tradition.

&gt;&gt; A major leader of the movement against the new Bill was a certain Swami Karpatri. In speeches in Delhi and elsewhere, he challenged Ambedkar to a public debate on the new Code. To the Law Minister’s claim that the Shastras did not really favour polygamy, Swami Karpatri quoted Yagnavalkya: ‘If the wife is a habitual drunkard, a confirmed invalid, a cunning, a barren or a spendthrift woman, if she is bitter-tongued, if she has got only daughters and no son, if she hates her husband, [then] the husband can marry a second wife even while the first is living’. The Swami supplied the precise citation for this injunction: the third verse of the third chapter of the third section of Yagnavalkya’s Smriti on marriage. He did not however tell us whether the injunction also allowed the wife to take another husband if the existing one was a drunkard, bitter-tongued, a spendthrift, etc.





Any rational person would want UCC, but they would want it because it is progressive. Not because of BJP and Congress' stupid political stunts. But I know you will find this hard to digest and will bring up some asinine reason or another to support these mentally archaic morons, therefore I won't waste more of my breath on it.

&gt; Ms Tirkey was in domestic service for Mr and Mrs Chandok, initially in India and later in the UK. She is from the Adivasi people, who some in India consider “low caste”.

&gt; Her case went to the Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) to decide the legal issue of whether or not caste discrimination claims can be pursued under the Equality Act 2010.

1905,"It is second best, next to working on a living human. Organs are there. Everything to size. You can touch, feel, cut, test. I mean, there is a reason and usefulness that's why they urge you to donate it. 



&gt; What I learned is this. To study the human body, nothing but a real one comes close. There are usable proxies — computer models and crash-test dummies, for example. But neither replaces the real thing and, in fact, both are built and tuned with data collected from cadavers. Without input from real bodies, with their real anatomical complexity, neither substitute would exist.

&gt; There are never enough whole-body donations. In any given year, researchers make do with what they’ve been given, but they could always use more. There are obstacles: a person or their surviving family must give consent, different legal frameworks exist from one country or region to the next, and some bodies aren’t suitable for all areas of research. Not every donation programme is what it seems, either, and the best way to ensure that my body goes to research is to donate through a state anatomical board or a medical school.

&gt; Many areas of research require cadavers. Scientists who study the biomechanics of injury, for example, want to understand how the human body gets hurt so that they can help to prevent it. They craft controlled tests to understand the impacts a cadaver can withstand. Then, after translating these measurements to a model or a dummy, they test and perfect the protective gear that keeps us safe.


&gt; Forensic scientists, too, use cadavers in their work. A handful of universities take donated bodies and plant them in the ground or place them in a secluded wood. Then the scientists map out the time it takes for the blowflies, dermestid beetles, and other scavengers to render the bodies to bones. This, I suppose, is a different sort of reincarnation — to become part of the ecosystem of a field or forest floor. It might seem a grim end, but the data can help forensic researchers identify the time when a person died and what injuries they might have suffered, which in turn helps law enforcement officers to solve murders.

It is illegal because it is against the court order and Delhi Nursing Home Registration Act

&gt; The priority right now should be to deliver patients the medical care that would help them. Not to make a stand against rogue hospitals.

They are doing both (search the news). This is a step to ensure hospitals provide care to those patients. This step is along with other measures like increasing capacity in government hospitals and making more doctors available. But government hospitals alone aren't adequate so they need to ensure compliance by private hospitals. Here is an example of what happened with one patient: 

&gt; Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia has ordered a magisterial inquiry into the alleged refusal by five private hospitals to admit a seven year-old boy suffering from Dengue, which led to his death and was followed by the tragic suicide of his parents.

&gt; The Director General of Health Services has already issued show cause notices to five private hospitals of South Delhi – Moolchand Khairati Ram Hospital, Max Superspeciality Hospital Saket, Akash Arogya Mandir Malviya Nagar, Saket City Hospital and Irene Hospital Kalkaji – under the provisions of the Delhi Nursing Homes Registration Act, 1953.


What does a patient do in this case? 5 bloody hospitals and 3 tragic deaths! 

&gt;  And it feeds into the narrative of them eyeing all private enterprises with suspicion and disdain. Which is not healthy.

That is the narrative you are assuming maybe because you see them in that light. If this was done by a 'capitalist friendly' party like BJP, would you assume this?",2015-09-15 16:37:10+00:00,cv2hae0,8.0,t1_cv2h3h4,296.0,india
2075,"Private hospitals are a problem because they are provided land and assistance on the understanding that they will treat patients (especially the poor ones). But they have not been doing this for a long time. 

&gt; According to Supreme Court and Delhi High Court guidelines, hospitals built on land given by the government at nominal rates have to reserve 25 per cent of out-patient facilities and 10 per cent of in-patient facilities for EWS patients.


Ensuring that adequate sanitation is there so dengue does not keep occurring is definitely government's responsibility. For this we need to blame state government (AAP) and municipal government (BJP). If only they put aside their differences and work together.

&gt; Simply taking over private hospitals to ensure better care just won't work.

Like this: http://i.imgur.com/xOvyLWg.gif

But *why* would give you the reason for it falling, which is gravity. From *Memoirs of Sir Isaac Newton's Life*, a conversation with Newton in Kensington on 15 April 1726:

&gt; ""Amid other discourse, he told me, he was just in the same situation, as when formerly the notion of gravitation came into his mind. **Why** sh[oul]d that apple always descend perpendicularly to the ground, thought he to himself; occasion'd by the fall of an apple, as he sat in contemplative mood.

&gt; ""**Why** sh[oul]d it not go sideways, or upwards? But constantly to the Earth's centre? Assuredly the reason is, that the Earth draws it. There must be a drawing power in matter. And the sum of the drawing power in the matter of the Earth must be in the Earth's centre, not in any side of the Earth.

In many situations you can indeed you can use 'how' to ask the same question, but essentially you are just rephrasing the same query using another English word. You can use *kyon* for it too, but in the end the answer will be the same. That brings us to the assertion that guy made about ""Firstly, science never answers why"" which as I showed, is simply not true (or I don't understand what he means).",2015-09-14 21:04:34+00:00,cv1krmu,9.0,t1_cv1gexa,6601.0,india

Bidet or a water spray which is attached to the pot itself. I find it disgusting that others feel happy with smearing poop all across their butt with a piece of paper (no offense). I mean, if you got poop on your face, would you wash it or use a piece of tissue? :) 

It is insane that despite 'development' and being able to afford a bidet so many countries carry on this ancient and unhygienic practice of using hay/piece of paper.

Yet people all over the world eat so many food items with their hands. [You can't enjoy ribs if you don't use your hands](http://i.imgur.com/XDDT9bQ.png)! What about the bread that you get with your main dish, don't you break it with your hand? One of the main items in Indian diet is roti (bread).

&gt; छात्रा पर घर में घुसकर हाथ उठाने वाली लखनऊ पुलिस शेम शेम.. घटना के बारे में सोशल मीडिया पर Anshuman Dubey ने जो जानकारी मुहैया कराई है, उसके मुताबिक नाबालिग लड़की 11वीं की छात्रा है. इसे पुलिस ने घर में घुसकर पीटा. उत्तर प्रदेश की राजधानी लखनऊ पुलिस का अमानवीय और बर्बर चेहरा एक बार फिर उजागर हुआ. आज आबकारी विभाग के उसरी में छापे के दौरान घंटो देर से आशियाना पुलिस पहुँची. पहुंचते ही थानाध्यक्ष संतोष तिवारी ने अपना सदाबहार अंदाज़ दिखाते हुये मौके से फ़रार तारा रावत और राजेन्द्र रावत की नाबालिग लड़की व एसबीएन कॉलेज की 11वीं की छात्रा को जमकर रसीद किये तमाचे. अभी कुछ दिन पहले ही उन्होंने थाने में भी इसी तरह पीड़ित पक्ष से मिलने थाने आये फरियादियों पर जमकर जूते लात चलाये. जबसे संतोष तिवारी ने एसओ आशियाना का पदभार ग्रहण किया है तभी से अपनी ऊँची पहुँच के चलते उनका व्यवहार तानाशाही से भरा और निरंकुशता से भरपूर रहा है.

Rough translation (feel free to improve):

&gt; Shame on police who entered the student's house. On social media Anshuman Dubey provided information that the girl is a minor and student of class 11. This happened during a police raid. The policeman Santosh Tiwari, after realizing that Tara Rawat and Rajendra Ravat had escaped, started slapping their daughter. 

&gt; A few days back he had done the same in the police station with some other people. Ever since he has joined as SO Ashiyana he has behaved in this way since he is well connected.

2208,"Photographer Souvid Datta's description of this project:

&gt; Narrow alleys, enclosed by towering, decayed brothels and bright market stalls form together in a confusing, colorful maze. This is Sonagachi, Kolkata - home to Asia's second largest red-light district.

&gt; The neighborhood exists as a sprawling, illegal network of organized gangs, traffickers and victims - a place where reporters and outsiders are threatened away by violence, politicians and police are bribed or complicit; and where an estimated 13,000 prostituted women, often under the age of 18, are effectively raped every day.

&gt; Over the past 30 years, the district has grown in the shadows, being left to fester. State and private initiatives have failed to tackle groups of petty criminals who now control territorial authority and resources. And a growing cultural stigmatization of those involved has bred disinterest and fostered exploitation. Today, younger and younger victims of trafficking come from further afar.

&gt; This year I gained access to Sonagachi. I spent time with prostituted women as young as 14 who had been kidnapped on their way to school from border-states. Their resilience, grace and collective enterprise astounded me; and at night, within dark brothel cells, I heard their cries for hours. Outside, police officials embraced gang-leaders and were offered their pick.

&gt; My first step was to document the reality of Sonagachi, from local rights abuses and institutional failure, to the urgent human narrative of women forced to live here.

&gt; The next phase of my reportage will take me beyond Sonagachi, tracing the trafficking routes back to their origins near the Bangladeshi and Nepali borders with India, where it is fertile ground for ‘procurers ’ and entire villages seem absent of teenage girls. Highlighting socio-economic conditions and local corruption in these villages will provide context for the prevalence and success of the trafficking business. And following individual procurers along their transport routes will reveal the logistics of how victims change hands, cross borders and enter the vast criminal networks of West Bengal. These are issues that have had very limited visual coverage, with restricted, outsider access.

&gt; I want this report to give voice to the thousands of trafficked young women who have been systematically stripped of human choice and expression. I want it to inform topical debates in India today on sexual inequality, graft and development. And, perhaps most importantly, I want it to provoke ordinary people to sit back callously no longer, but begin empathizing, questioning and contributing to a process of improvement.",2015-09-09 08:57:54+00:00,cuvevuo,1.0,t3_3k7skm,217.0,india

Direct link means that the link should contain the information you're claiming.

I'd like to know your stance on Net Neutrality. I ask this question in the context of your support to Facebook's Internet.Org in my country India where Wikipedia has decided to ally itself with FB which violates net neutrality and gives an upper-hand to established internet companies.

Back when you started Wikipedia, do you think Wikipedia could have ever grown if another encyclopedia like Britannica had tied up with telecom providers to either shut Wikipedia out or charge selectively for data?

2422,"&gt; ONLY IF - the eye witness is proved to be reliable. In case of single eye witness

Of course, that is a given. This is true for any evidence. 

&gt; You are right but in itself very rarely hold water unless you have 20-30 people corroborating the same story

Best bakery conviction hinged on 4 witnesses, even when the star witness turned hostile. You are now going into the details of what can go wrong with a witness, while my comment was on how important eyewitness can be to case. You will never hear any lawyer or court go 'meh, it is just an eyewitness'.

2423,"It is treated as evidence. It is not the sole criteria for conviction, but is valued a lot. I agree that there huge problems, but during the trial court tries to determine the credibility of the witness, while the defense tries to discredit it. 

Now I can't find an India specific article right now, so I will give you an example from UK.

&gt; Are eyewitness testimonies reliable forms of evidence?

&gt; Eyewitness testimonies are one of the most common forms of evidence used by the police to charge somebody with an offence, and then subsequently used by the crown prosecution service (CPS) to try to convict a defendant.

&gt; Clearly, eyewitness evidence is not the most reliable form of evidence as often it relies on that individual telling the truth, remembering the incident and having a clear view of what actually happened.

&gt; In the UK, if the eyewitness evidence brought by the CPS is disputed by the defendant, the court will apply specific rules and guidelines in assessing what weight can be given to that evidence.

&gt; If there is a Turnbull witness, a judge, rather than a jury, will decide what strength should be given to this evidence. Although it will be a jury that decides if an individual is guilty of a crime, a judge will give a string indication whether any weight should be given to this particular piece of evidence.

&gt; What criteria does a judge use to assess the evidence?

&gt; * The distance the eyewitness was from the activity or crime that took place; naturally if it was seen from a great distance, less weight is likely to be given.

&gt; * The time of day and thus the level of darkness: clearly if the sighting was at 3am in pitch darkness there is likely to be more doubt over an accurate identification.

&gt; * The length of time the witness saw the defendant; if it was only a fleeting glance as opposed to a few minutes, a judge is likely to be more sceptical of the evidence.

&gt; * Did the witness actually see the face of the defendant? Often a witness may only see the back of the defendant in which case it will be a lot easier for the defendant to deny that it was actually him.

&gt; * The general conditions that may have affected the sighting: if it was an extremely foggy day, or the sighting took place in a crowded area, or there was a large obstacle obstructing the view, all these things will be taken into account by a judge.

&gt; * Whether the witness already knew the defendant before the sighting.

&gt; * How close the description given by the witness to the police at the time actually matches to the description of the defendant.

&gt; Eyewitness testimonies are used as evidence; we cannot expect every sighting to be caught on television or CCTV and therefore there is no reason why the evidence should not be put forward. A judge will, however, have to weigh up a number of factors before assessing how credible the eyewitness testimony is and simply one particular sighting of an individual is unlikely to be sufficient evidence in itself.

&gt; http://findlaw.co.uk/law/dispute_resolution/litigation/trial/500528.html

So it isn't like they blindly believe everything they are told. But if indeed there is a witness who is credible, s/he is very valuable for the prosecution and has a big impact on the case.",2015-08-25 11:27:58+00:00,cuey68t,6.0,t1_cuexx7w,888.0,india
2424,"&gt; it is case specific and charge specific

The girl alleged abuse and harassment. That is specific. Eyewitness can either support her or contradict her, which can decide the fate of the case. 

There are hardly any instances where a sole piece can form a prosecution's case. Even if a murder weapon is found, you need to prove that the accused was present at the scene and did not have an alibi. My comment was only that eyewitness testimony is valued a lot by lawyers and the court.",2015-08-25 11:17:55+00:00,cuey015,8.0,t1_cuexygz,157.0,india

&gt; – “While data on the actual impact of these plans is limited, early data suggests that these programs can be an ‘on ramp’ to full Internet access”

One of the specific allegations made against them earlier:

&gt; Purchase of equipment at higher prices and fraud billing: Between 2004 to2006, Anil Ambani companies have shown that they purchased equipment worth Rs 1428, crores from their sister company Reliance Energy Ltd (REL). Then Brijender Singh checked the VAT records of REL from VAT department of Delhi Government and found that REL had purchased these equipment at Rs 850 crores. It means that DISCOMs had artificially increased their expenses. 

&gt; Sudhakar found that the two Anil Ambani companies were showing Zero bills
for a number of consumers. A test check found that the consumers had
actually consumed electricity and paid bills. But in the accounts presented before the Commission, they were shown to have Zero Bills. Sudhakar test checked roughly 1% entries of the total consumers and detected that 10% of
the test checked entries were shown to have zero bills. 

They indulged in many such practices to create an artificial loss and make their case strong for an increase in electricity tariff (which then actually did happen).

A couple of months back I was walking with my father on a narrow footbridge. We stopped to look at something for a second and a cyclist came rushing in out of nowhere. We quickly moved to the side to give him space, but the fact that he had to fractionally slow down seemed to piss him off and he shouted at us. This is when there are clear signs all around that ask cyclists to slow down. [The bridge  is curved](http://i.imgur.com/H2Uk0pG.jpg) and it is so unsafe to ride like that.

Then last week, further along the same path, another cyclist who seemed to be in a mad rush veered towards me deliberately while staring because he was offended that I did not give him more space to cycle. There was 5 feet of space and two 2 cyclists before him conveniently passed us. On top of it there are signs all over asking cyclists to ride on the other side of the path.

A more interesting question is, why did the people who actually planted the bombs not get death sentences from SC?

I will take example of one guy from this list:

&gt; Shoaib Ghansar planted an RDX-laden scooter in Zaveri Bazaar that killed 17 and injured 57 others

&gt; He was also guilty of filling RDX in the scooter the previous night at Al-Hussaini building that killed 17 people and injured 57.

&gt; [New York Manhole Covers, Forged Barefoot in India](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/26/nyregion/26manhole.html?_r=0)

&gt; Seemingly impervious to the heat from the metal, the workers at one of West Bengal’s many foundries relied on strength and bare hands rather than machinery. Safety precautions were barely in evidence; just a few pairs of eye goggles were seen in use on a recent visit. The foundry, Shakti Industries in Haora, produces manhole covers for Con Edison and New York City’s Department of Environmental Protection, as well as for departments in New Orleans and Syracuse.

&gt; The scene was as spectacular as it was anachronistic: flames, sweat and liquid iron mixing in the smoke like something from the Middle Ages. That’s what attracted the interest of a photographer who often works for The New York Times — images that practically radiate heat and illustrate where New York’s manhole covers are born.

&gt; The temperature outside the factory yard was more than 100 degrees on a September visit. Several feet from where the metal was being poured, the area felt like an oven, and the workers were slick with sweat.

&gt; Often, sparks flew from pots of the molten metal. In one instance they ignited a worker’s lungi, a skirtlike cloth wrap that is common men’s wear in India. He quickly, reflexively, doused the flames by rubbing the burning part of the cloth against the rest of it with his hand, then continued to cart the metal to a nearby mold.

&gt; “We can’t maintain the luxury of Europe and the United States, with all the boots and all that,” said Sunil Modi, director of Shakti Industries. He said, however, that the foundry never had accidents. He was concerned about the attention, afraid that contracts would be pulled and jobs lost.

The Congress never attacked (former PM) Atal Bihar Vajpayee's son-in-law Ranjan Bhattacharya or (senior BJP leader) L K Advani's son and daughter. Have we ever said a word against them? They have a private life of their own."" 

&gt; When asked if the Congress brought their names up because there was nothing to ask of them, Mr Singh said, ""We had enough evidence, but we never attacked them. Don't make me open my mouth about Ranjan Bhattacharya."" During the prime ministership of Mr Vajpayee, it was often said that Mr Bhattacharya had a lot of influence over the prime minister's office and in government, despite having no official position.

How they were helped to settle in Pak. Bought land for house for 60 lakhs (construction 1.16 crores), paid by Tiger. Denies handling anything for him, says Tiger had contacts and money and paid for everything. 

Madhu says Yakub had a comfortable life, had settled in with new house, ID cards, school certificate, passport provided by the Pak officials - why would Pak do this? Yakub said because ISI was behind the blast. Madhu asked, but why you? He says because they wanted to support Tiger.

Says he came back to show that Memon family isn't behind the blast but ISI and wants the international community to know this.

Overall he totally blames Tiger and Pak government. Madhu finds it unbelievable that he did not know that Tiger was involved with the underworld.  He claims that he got to know in 1990, not before that.

Court does not work based on 'feelings'. If there is even a little chance that justice may be getting denied, the court gives the accused/convict a chance. This is especially important in a death trial because you can't reverse the decision once someone is dead.

&gt; * Kalam started his career by designing a small helicopter for the Indian Army, but remained unconvinced with the choice of his job at DRDO.

&gt; * Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.[9] In 1969, Kalam was transferred to theIndian Space Research Organization (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near earth orbit in July 1980.

&gt; * Joining ISRO was one of Kalam's biggest achievements in life and he is said to have found himself when he started to work on the SLV project.

&gt; * Kalam first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965. In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the program to include more engineers.

&gt; * In 1963–64, he visited Nasa's Langley Research Center in Hampton Virginia, Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland andWallops Flight Facility situated at Eastern Shore of Virginia.
During the period between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar SLV and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be success.

&gt; * In the 1970s, Kalam also directed two projects, namely, Project Devil and Project Valiant , which sought to develop ballistic missiles from the technology of the successful SLV programme. Despite the disapproval of Union Cabinet, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for these aerospace projects through her discretionary powers under Kalam's directorship.Kalam played an integral role convincing the Union Cabinet to conceal the true nature of these classified aerospace projects.

&gt; * His research and educational leadership brought him great laurels and prestige in 1980s, which prompted the government to initiate an advanced missile program under his directorship.

&gt; * Kalam and Dr. V. S. Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to the Defense Minister, worked on the suggestion by the then Defense Minister, R. Venkataraman on a proposal for simultaneous development of a quiver of missiles instead of taking planned missiles one by one.R Venkatraman was instrumental in getting the cabinet approval for allocating 388 crore rupees for the mission, named Integrated Guided Missile Development Program (I.G.M.D.P) and appointed Kalam as the Chief Executive.

&gt; * Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under the mission including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic missile and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile, although the projects have been criticised for mismanagement and cost and time overruns. 
He was the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and the Secretary of Defence Research and Development Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999.

&gt; * The Pokhran-II nuclear tests were conducted during this period where he played an intensive political and technological role. Kalam served as the Chief Project Coordinator, along with R. Chidambaram during the testing phase. Photos and snapshots of him taken by the media elevated Kalam as the country's top nuclear scientist.
In 1998, along with cardiologist Dr.Soma Raju, Kalam developed a low cost Coronary stent. It was named as ""Kalam-Raju Stent"" honouring them.

&gt; * In 2012, the duo, designed a rugged tablet PC for health care in rural areas, which was named as ""Kalam-Raju Tablet"".

What if your heirloom was an invaluable Rembrandt painting that had been stolen by your ancestors from someone else.

Now, a family member of yours might still put ownership above survival of this painting because of their personal bias.

My father wanted a copy of a newspaper published in India in 1800s. I wrote to British Library and they made it available. Another /r/india redditor I met recently in London wanted to see archives about his grandfather and was able to access them in the British Library. Right now in India you can forget ever being able to obtain stuff like this.

Till the time India improves its ability to curate such items I would not want them back. Such valuable treasures are literally rotting in Indian archives and museums; it's depressing. My sister worked with national museum in Delhi and they did not even have proper logs of what items they have and what they do not. She has worked with museums in Europe and the difference in expertise, professionalism and knowledge is like night and day.

3070,"To live, I'd say London. Especially for desis. 

Edit: To elaborate, lots of fantastic cities are mentioned in this thread and they are all great. To visit Amsterdam, Bruges and Barcelona are probably my favourite. But if you have to live, you need to take into account language and your ability to identify and integrate with the city. Some things that make it easier for Indian immigrants: 

* Language: You will never feel out of place in a conversation. Indian accent is based on the British one, so you don't even have to modify the way you speak for others to understand you. As another user said, it is a melting pot so everyone has a totally different accent and people don't expect you to change yours.

* Shared history: They understand when we talk about our country. A crazy lot of them have been to India and have probably seen more of the country than many of us. British Library is full of Indian documents, British Museum has so many Indian artifacts. Every relevant major museum has something on India.

* Lots of Indians: Some (cynical) people might not like it, but it gives Indians an advantage - there are always cultural/entertainment programs catering to Indians. Every major Bollywood movie is easily available in theaters. There are constant exhibitions and food festivals related to India. Even the Jaipur literature festival has a London edition. There are Holi and Diwali melas organised by local councils. All of this makes sure that you don't miss home as much as you would in other places. This almost feels like home!

* Food: The best restaurants here can compete with the best in India. Brits love Indian food, this means there is Indian food available in every area. Guess which restaurant won the best British restaurant award last year? [Traditional Bombay-style cafe beats Heston Blumenthal's Michelin-starred restaurant to be crowned the best in the UK](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/food/article-2930279/Dishoom-beats-Michelin-starred-restaurant-Dinner-Heston-Blumenthal-crowned-UK-s-best-Yelp-users.html). My local chain store has frozen parathas! Tesco's smaller Indian stores also have Indian items and snacks. Several Indian markets in the city so you can get pretty much everything (there is even a *paanwala*).

* Others reasons: Drive on the same side  and you can use Indian license for 1 year. Indians can vote in UK elections, so you are politically integrated too and politicians also care about what your opinion on things is. They play cricket and if you're into football you will feel right at home too! 

All of the above are about the Indian connection. I haven't even spoken about the city itself; the history, the infrastructure (London and NYC are the only two [Alpha++ cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_city)), how beautiful it is! As Samuel Johnson said, ""When a man is tired of London, he is tired of life; for there is in London all that life can afford.""

&gt; Kamal Nath was again embroiled in controversy in March 2002 when the Supreme Court, applying the polluter pays principle, imposed a fine of Rs10,00,000 (US$25,000) on Kamal Nath for damaging the environment by building a motel on the bank of Beas river near Kulu-Manali in the state of Himachal Pradesh. This act changed the course of the river and thus caused ecological imbalance in that area. 

.

&gt; Kamal Nath benefited from Bengal contract: WikiLeaks. The communication further suggests Nath’s company, which produced electrical cables, had been given a large West Bengal government contract, possibly while Choudhury was in office, and described the company as “probably as profitable an enterprise as one could find in all of India” at that time.

.

&gt; On November 29, 1976, Nath told the US Consul General in Calcutta that India was ""making two more atomic bombs and has plans for one more peaceful explosion. The Consul General said Nath ""speaks with such brashness, boastfulness, and at times naive simplicity that one tends to discount it all"". The US correctly believed that India would not go for another round of nuclear tests, just two years after the 1974 programme.

3114,"&gt; Singhiya, the wizard who was adept in black magic fell in love with Ratnavati, the princess of Bhangarh who was very beautiful and had suitors to marry her from many royal families of the country. One day while the princess, 18 years of age, went shopping with her friends and was buying Ittar (scent). The wizard saw this and replaced the scent with some potion in order to ensnare the princess. He offered the potion to her so that she took a liking for him and marry him.[6][7] However, the princess saw through the wizard's trickery and when he offered her the bowl of potion, she threw it on a big boulder nearby and as a result the boulder started rolling down towards the wizard and crushed him. Before he died he cursed that Bhangarh would be destroyed soon and no one will be able to live within its precincts. 

&gt; Subsequent to the curse Bhangarh Fort was invaded by the Mughals from the north and the city was surrounded and sacked; 10,000 people lived in the fort city at that time. All the people in the fort including the princess were killed. The present state of the fort is attributed to the curse of the wizard and people believe the ghosts in the fort are that of the princess and the wizard. [6][7] Since that day, it is believed that paranormal activities take place here during the nights. Some deaths have been reported due to these paranormal activities too. There are sayings that some of the people's spirit surrounds the boundary of the fort as no one can enter the premises. The princess's spirit has been forcefully abducted by the wizard.

Lastly, do you really think this blackout would work? Set a reminder to this comment of mine - it won't because vast majority of casual users are not that invested into the internal functioning of reddit. They come here for their daily dose of entertainment and will still come on that day.

Secondly, has anyone even asked Victoria if should like to work again in an environment like this? Why jump the gun before even asking the parties involved? This whole things seems like it is being conceived as a confrontational one-upmanship instead of trying to find realistic solutions which will help the entire reddit community.

3146,"Reddit is not going anywhere any time soon. I will quote some comments which I read in another thread comparing Diggs demise with reddit and I agree with their assessment. 

About Reddit and Digg:

&gt; Reddit is to digg what Facebook is to Myspace, people don't seem to realize that both have vastly outgrown their predecessors. Dig wasn't even close to as mainstream as Reddit currently is, if all y'all ex-diggers leave then reddit will still survive and thrive. Just like Facebook is thriving and surviving even if it's first intended target (college kids) aren't using it all that often.
Is there eventually going to be a time where it's replaced? Sure. Is it going to be within the next 5 years? No.

.

&gt; Digg completely changed their structure, so casual users were also dissatisfied and left of their own accord. In contrast, Reddit has made small business decisions that don't affect casual users or people with functioning nervous systems, so an exodus is a tough sell.


About Mods Vs Admins:

&gt; Moderators aren't a special subset of the human race, anyone can become a mod, and frankly I'd appreciate getting away from the cabal-like structure of moderation currently.

&gt; There are, like, three content creators on reddit. Reddit's front page has proven that interesting OC isn't a prerequisite for attracting a large user-base. In my case I just come here for smaller subreddits, which are more discussion-based than content-based. Many people come for reposted cat photos. All of these can easily be supplied by just about anyone.

&gt; I won't deny that reddit will die at some point, but I don't think it will be this easy. People look at myspace and digg and think that they're portents for the mortality of all other websites, but you have to keep in mind that those were the first websites of their kind. Facebook and reddit have crystallized in the public consciousness and will be much more difficult to topple. Either way, all we can do now is get the popcorn and watch it play out.",2015-07-03 18:41:17+00:00,csr8cvr,5.0,t1_csr85ij,375.0,india

&gt; NEW DELHI: When Ghantewala opened in 1790, Mughal emperor Shah Alam II ruled Delhi, Tipu Sultan was firmly in the saddle in Mysore and Paris still consumed by the French Revolution. On Wednesday, the 225-year-old iconic sweet shop in Old Delhi's Chandni Chowk downed its shutters. A delectable chapter in the capital's culinary history is over.

&gt; ""It is difficult for me to talk about the shop right now. Please remember we owned it for eight generations. The thing is: falling sales made it an unprofitable venture for us,"" owner Sushant Jain told TOI over phone.

Notice the plural? My comment was not just specific to this incident but about how they are brutal and medieval with their laws in general. Maybe KSA's public flogging is 'nicer' than their neighbours yet it is a painful punishment with the intention of hurting and humiliating.  They also do practice public execution.  

Secondly there is something inherently 'brutal' about public punishment like this. Brutal acts aren't just physical; there is a reason why most civilised countries do not have public punishments. These are followed mostly by those who are still basing their laws on ancient and outdated religious texts.

&gt; Ground borne noise caused by tunnelling operations have the
potential to cause significant community annoyance because,
in general the operations are continuous twenty four hours
per day. The noise is generally characterised as a low rumbling
sound, however, the frequency can vary depending
upon the machinery that initiates the vibration and the receiving
environment.


&gt; In general the ground borne noise generated by tunnelling
activities will create annoyance long before the actual vibration
can be perceived. Audible noise occurs within structures
when vibration is transmitted into the building through foundations
or other parts of the building in direct contact with
the ground. The vibration causes the oscillation of floors,
ceilings, walls and other objects in the receiving room which
then radiate sound.

&gt; Q.) What are the licensing requirements to drive with Uber in London?

&gt; A.) Uber works with Public Carriage Office (PCO) licensed drivers. At the time of onboarding, you will need to bring with you all up-to-date legally required documents. For yourself this includes:

&gt; * A valid driver's license

&gt; * PCO license. (private hire license)

&gt; For your vehicle you will also need to bring:

&gt; * A valid MOT (car's road-worthiness certificate)

&gt; * Logbook

&gt; * Commercial insurance certificate

After I got my full UK license, car rental companies told me that they would not be able to give cars to me for a year. Since I don't own a car, this means that I will not drive a car for a year but then somehow my skills will magically improve enough to get a car after that period. Even more strange is that I had already rented cars from these companies multiple times because I had a valid foreign license.

The whole idea of a full license is that people are fit to drive after they obtain it. Setting an arbitrary waiting period makes no sense. If they want to improve the skills of new drivers, they should make the test more stringent and standardized (I passed on my second attempt and it was so damn easy compared to the first).",2015-06-23 14:39:20+00:00,csfx44k,2.0,t1_csfw2i2,1851.0,london

All this is violation of environmental norms (according to Gujarat HC). Not to mention the treatment of the farmers.

&gt; On 11 February, responding to a PIL by Mundra’s farmers, the Gujarat High Court served a notice to Adani’s SEZ and the Gujarat government for illegally taking 231 acres of Navinal village pastures for the Mundra SEZ. Navinal is just one of 23 villages whose sarpanches sold off grazing land keeping the Gram Sabha in the dark.

&gt; “Our sarpanch was a plumber; he now has a Rs. 6 crore company. First they sent guards to stop us from using our land, now they send the police and BSF. When we approach the company for a job, they turn us away,” says Ibrahim Turk, a high school graduate of Dhrab village.

Edit: See the deliberate misclassification of forests to support Adani's SEZ:

&gt; As per the Supreme Court’s classification of forests, Adani destroyed 2,000 hectares of mangroves in Kutch to build its ports, says the new CAG report tabled in Gujarat Assembly

&gt; The committee also comprised of government forest officials from both the Centre and the state. The committee found incontrovertible evidence against Adani Group for violating environmental norms. It found that in order to develop its ports, Adani Group blocked most of the creeks in the area with construction activity.

3365,"Photo description by the photographer:

&gt; The Jats who live in Kutch are particularly conscious of their identity as a group and their sense of unity comes from a perception of shared historical traditions and a belief in common ancestry.
Originally the Jats were herders who lived in an area called Half in Iran. Five hundred years ago these shepherds migrated from Half and came to Sindh and Kutch to search for new grazing lands. They crossed the Rann of Kutch and settled there taking up farming, they became known as Dhaneta Jats. Some have devted themselves to the study of the Koran and are known as the Fakirani Jats. All the Jats in Kutch are Muslims and have similar marriage and dowry customs.
 
&gt; The Dhanetas are the largest of the Jat Communities. They live throughtout north western Kutch. The Dhanetas live in the Banni, herd cattle. The men care for the animals and women remain in camp looking after their families.

3367,"I have done this for friends and family and I have to say the photographer has to be very committed to the job to cover a family member's wedding without getting distracted. There are always people coming over, trying to talk to you. A moment of distraction would mean a lost photo opportunity. Plus, the photographer won't be able to enjoy the wedding at all (it's a full time job that requires constant work and attention). 

I would have recommended this if you had not budgeted for a photographer and you knew your relative's temperament well (Is he open to suggestions/flexible/easy to work with)? In your case, I'd say hire a photographer. ",2015-06-16 13:22:24+00:00,cs8bc1a,1.0,t3_39zrof,38227.0,weddingplanning
