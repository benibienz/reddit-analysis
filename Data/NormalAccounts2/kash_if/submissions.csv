We have an AMA scheduled with the filmmaker Suneel Raghavendra, whose film generated quite a bit of excitement when it was screened at the 8th Bangalore International Film Festival (BIFFES). One redditor had even recommended in [one of the threads here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4vcnu5/movie_recommendation_puta_tirugisi_nodi_what_a/).

'Although a trained Engineer, Suneel received a Diploma in Filmmaking (Writing and Direction) from the Prague Film School. After working in the direction department on Prakash Raj’s directorial debut NAANU NANNA KANASU, he became an Assistant Director on B Suresha’s National Award winning PUTTAKKANA HIGHWAY.  A few short films later, Suneel took the first step towards feature filmmaking with PUTA TIRUGISI NODU.'

His latest film is about Mohan – a young, cricketer turned teacher, who has to overcome a big challenge in his personal life, and teach a motley bunch of kids what it means to play hard but fair.

Sorry about 'her' in the title. Kind of shows how difficult it is subconsciously for even supportive people like me to fully come to terms with it. 


I wanted to check what the latest was in this case, and I got to know that he got his travel documents back! The news is over two weeks old, but I don't remember seeing it in /r/India, so I thought I'd share it.

&gt; On Monday, Shivy’s mother, who had appeared in court, returned all travel documents to him and agreed to pay his tuition fee and give financial support to continue his studies in neurobiology. The family also purchased the ticket for his return to the US.

The judge in this case was awesome. If you remember, earlier he had provided Shivy police protection and stopped UP police from harassing him and the NGO. I loved this bit in the verdict:

&gt; “Gender identity and sexual orientation are fundamental to the right of self-determination, dignity and freedom. These freedoms lie at the heart of personal autonomy and freedom of individuals. A transgender’s sense or experience of gender is integral to their core personality and sense of being. Insofar as I understand the law, everyone has a fundamental right to be recognised in their chosen gender,” noted the bench in its judgment. - [Source](http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/shivy-gets-back-his-identity-documents/)

This is the original /r/India thread:

&gt; https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3m5kdw/

Tl;dr of the incident:

Shivy is a green card holder pursuing undergraduate studies in California. His parents had moved to the US when he was 5 years old. His parents brought him to India in June on the pretext of meeting his sick grandmother. Once in India, Shivy’s parents took away his passport and other documents, and enrolled him in a college in Agra to “learn to act like a proper girl”.

I am planning to get a large print of this made for my wife's birthday so help would be really appreciated!

I went on a holiday and took this photo. But the day was really overcast and rainy, so the photo did not come out as I wanted it. I edited it myself too but am not happy with the result.  

The main problem is the colour of the lake and sky. It was blue, but it looks white here. I tried colour replacement through PS, but am not getting the desired result. My photo:

I want the image to look as close to this as possible to this:

&gt; http://i.imgur.com/fzt4JLs.jpg

I can provide the RAW file. If you can explain the process, that would be very helpful too because I'd like to learn as well.

I know this will take some effort, and I don't mean to be insulting at all, but my budget is a little low. I can offer you $15 for helping me. Please think of this as me buying you a drink :) 

Thank you!

**Edit**: Thank you very much to those who have tried to help so far. To clarify a little more, I am fairly competent with LR/PS myself. But I am not happy with my version. I am looking for a higher quality edit. Here is my version:

I and /u/Joan_Wayne_Gacy have joined as mods of this sub. Both of us are experienced moderators and take care of other very active communities.

The purpose of this thread is to get some feedback from you about what we can do to improve the sub, and to also share some ideas we had in mind. A few things that we have already started working on are:

* **Reducing spam**: Right now there is a lot of spam being pushed into this sub. It reduces the appeal of the sub. From now on all of it will be removed and each submission will get checked by us and spammers will be banned right away (will also update automod to weed out spam). We realize that earlier it took a much longer time for us to respond, but please feel free to directly tag us in threads that break the rules or are spammy. *A question for you*: I noticed, recently a lot of instagram image threads are being submitted by zero day (brand new) reddit accounts. Should this be allowed by us, or should we restrict it  to redditors who have a participation history? The reason is that this sub is ideally for redditors to connect and discuss things related to Instagram. We would not like it to become a haven for instagram spammers who flock here to only promote their content and not be a part of the community. [Self promotion without participation is frowned upon by reddit](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Your thoughts? 

* **Making the community more interactive**: What can be done to make /r/Instagram more engaging? One idea is to replace the photo share threads with a weekly photo challenge. I will post a theme each week and you share an image of yours related to the theme. We can have winners based on voting in the thread (can look at the possibility of guilding the winners). I personally feel that this is better than just a passive photo submission thread. What are your thoughts on this?

* **Improving weekly follow threads**: This is probably the most popular feature of this subreddit. Is there anything we can do to improve it? Would you like us to run this thread in '[contest mode](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof2012/comments/159bww/introducing_contest_mode_a_tool_for_your_voting/)' to avoid downvoting? 

* **AMA**: Would you like to interact with some well known instagrammers? We can possibly arrange AMA with them, but this can only be done if there is a lot of community interest, otherwise the AMA will be pretty dead. 


Do you have any others ideas, thoughts, criticism? Please feel free to share them.

Aditi is the third Indian to join a top British football club, after Mohammed Salim who played for Scottish team Celtic FC in 1936 and Bhaichung Bhutia who played for Bury FC between 1999-2002. Here is some more information from a recent article:

&gt; [Aditi Singh Chauhan](http://i.imgur.com/jdGqFMu.jpg) is not only a member of a somewhat rare breed — a woman footballer — now she is also the first Indian woman to play English league football. The 22-year-old goalkeeper has recently made her debut for one of England’s top football clubs, West Ham United, in the opening game of the season against Coventry City. 

&gt; The young woman has been immersed in sports through her growing years. She has played zonal basketball in school and that, she feels, has helped develop her goalkeeping skills. “My basketball coach from school, Mr Anil Yadav, suggested that I give trials as a goalkeeper for Delhi. That is how I started playing football. Back then, I never thought that I would be playing for a club in England one day,” she says.

Aditi also has an MSc in Sports Management.

I get a feeling that this maybe be one of those rare instances which can happen anywhere, but since I will be travelling with my family I just want to be sure.

Have any of you faced something like this? If a local could provide information, it would be super helpful.

&gt; A heartfelt obituary by his aide who spent the last few hours with 'The Teacher' (via Facebook):

&gt; What I will be remembered for.. my memory of the last day with the great Kalam sir...

&gt; It has been eight hours since we last talked – sleep eludes me and memories keep flushing down, sometimes as tears. Our day, 27th July, began at 12 noon, when we took our seats in the flight to Guhawati. Dr. Kalam was 1A and I was IC. He was wearing a dark colored “Kalam suit”, and I started off complimenting, “Nice color!” Little did I know this was going to be the last color I will see on him.
Long, 2.5 hours of flying in the monsoon weather. I hate turbulence, and he had mastered over them. Whenever he would see me go cold in shaking plane, he would just pull down the window pane and saw, “Now you don’t see any fear!”.

&gt; That was followed by another 2.5 hours of car drive to IIM Shillong. For these two legged trip of five hours we talked, discussed and debated. These were amongsthundreds of the long flights and longer drives we have been together over the last six years. 

&gt; As each of them, this was as special too. Three incidents/discussions in particular will be “lasting memories of our last trip”. 

&gt; First, Dr. Kalam was absolutely worried about the attacks in Punjab. The loss of innocent lives left him filledwith sorrow. The topic of lecture at IIM Shillong was Creating a Livable Planet Earth. He related the incident to the topic and said, “it seems the man made forces are as big a threat to the livability of earth as pollution”. We discussed on how, if this trend of violence, pollution and reckless human action continues we will forced to leave earth. “Thirty years, at this rate, maybe”, he said. “You guys must do something about it… it is going to be your future world”

&gt;Our second discussion was more national. For the past two days, Dr. Kalam was worried that time and again Parliament, the supreme institution of democracy, was dysfunctional. He said, “I have seen two different governments in my tenure. I have seen more after that. This disruption just keeps happening. It is not right. I really need to find out a way to ensure that the parliament works on developmental politics.” He then asked me to prepare a surprise assignment question for the students at IIM Shillong, which he would give them only at the end of the lecture. He wanted to them to suggest three innovative ways to make the Parliament more productive and vibrant. Then, after a while he returned on it. “But how can ask them to give solutions if I don’t have any myself”. For the next one hour, we thwarted options after options, who come up with his recommendation over the issue. We wanted to include this discussion in our upcoming book, Advantage India. 
Third, was an experience from the beauty of his humility. We were in a convoy of 6-7 cars. Dr. Kalam and I were in the second car. Ahead us was an open gypsy with three soldiers in it. Two of them were sitting on either side and one lean guy was standing atop, holding his gun. One hour into the road journey, Dr. Kalam said, “Why is he standing? He will get tired. This is like punishment. Can you ask a wireless message to given that he may sit?” I had to convince him, he has been probably instructed to keep standing for better security. He did not relent. We tried radio messaging, that did not work. For the next 1.5 hours of the journey, he reminded me thrice to see if I can hand signal him to sit down. Finally, realizing there is little we can do – he told me, “I want to meet him and thank him”. Later, when we landed in IIM Shillong, I went inquiring through security people and got hold of the standing guy. I took him inside and Dr. Kalam greeted him. He shook his hand, said thank you buddy. “Are you tired? Would you like something to eat? I am sorry you had to stand so long because of me”. The young lean guard, draped in black cloth, was surprised at the treatment. He lost words, just said, “Sir, aapke liye to 6 ghante bhi khade rahenge”. 

&gt; After this, we went to the lecture hall. He did not want to be late for the lecture. “Students should never be made to wait”, he always said. I quickly set up his mike, briefed on final lecture and took position on the computers. As I pinned his mike, he smiled and said, “Funny guy! Are you doing well?” ‘Funny guy’, when said by Kalam could mean a variety of things, depending on the tone and your own assessment. It could mean, you have done well, you have messed up something, you should listen to him or just that you have been plain naïve or he was just being jovial. Over six years I had learnt to interpret Funny Guy like the back of my palm. This time it was the last case. 

&gt; “Funny guy! Are you doing well?” he said. I smiled back, “Yes”. Those were the last words he said. Two minutes into the speech, sitting behind him, I heard a long pause after completing one sentence. I looked at him, he fell down. 
We picked him up. As the doctor rushed, we tried whatever we could. I will never forget the look in his three-quarter closed eyes and I held his head with one hand and tried reviving with whatever I could. His hands clenched, curled onto my finger. There was stillness on his face and those wise eyes were motionlessly radiating wisdom. He never said a word. He did not show pain, only purpose was visible. 
In five minutes we were in the nearest hospital. In another few minutes the they indicated the missile man had flown away, forever. I touched his feet, one last time. Adieu old friend! Grand mentor! See you in my thoughts and meet in the next birth. 

&gt; As turned back, a closet of thoughts opened. 

&gt; Often he would ask me, “You are young, decide what will like to be remembered for?” I kept thinking of new impressive answers, till one day I gave up and resorted to tit-for-tat. I asked him back, “First you tell me, what will you like to be remembered for? President, Scientist, Writer, Missile man, India 2020, Target 3 billion…. What?” I thought I had made the question easier by giving options, but he sprang on me a surprise. “Teacher”, he said. 

&gt; Then something he said two weeks back when we were discussing about his missile time friends. He said, “Children need to take care of their parents. It is sad that sometimes this is not happening”. He paused and said, “Two things. Elders must also do. Never leave wealth at your deathbed – that leaves a fighting family. Second, one is blessed is one can die working, standing tall without any long drawn ailing. Goodbyes should be short, really short”. 

&gt; Today, I look back – he took the final journey, teaching, what he always wanted to be remembered doing. And, till his final moment he was standing, working and lecturing. He left us, as a great teacher, standing tall. He leaves the world with nothing accumulated in his account but loads of wishes and love of people. He was a successful, even in his end. 

&gt; Will miss all the lunches and dinners we had together, will miss all the times you surprised me with your humility and startled me with your curiosity, will miss the lessons of life you taught in action and words, will miss our struggles to race to make into flights, our trips, our long debates. You gave me dreams, you showed me dreams need to be impossible, for anything else is a compromise to my own ability. The man is gone, the mission lives on. Long live Kalam.

&gt; Your indebted student,

**Rehosted Video**: https://vid.me/ON37


**Article**: After a video of a youth brutally assaulting a stray dog went viral on social networking sites, animal activists have written to Delhi Police commissioner asking him to take action against the accused. The youth has since taken down his Facebook page after the criticism. 

The 23-second video, uploaded late on Thursday night, shows the youth wearing a black T-shirt cuddling the dog. While initially it looks like any other pet cuddling video, it's brutally is seen within seconds. The youth is seen grabbing one of the hind legs and whirling the dog around for a few seconds. The dog is seen in intense pain and whining. After rotating the dog for a few seconds, the youth throws it against a parked car.

The youth, whose Facebook profile said that he is from Delhi, uploaded the video with the title, ""My new video, lamer no (sic)"". His profile claims that he studied at Florida State University. 

Meanwhile, Humane Society International (HSI) India has offered a reward of up to Rs 1 lakh for information leading to the identification, arrest and conviction of the person responsible for brutally abusing the dog.
