26,"Yea broadband should be enough for those. But be aware of data limit though. As for BAC I think you better email them to ask, sometimes it is not stated inside the lists. 2016 without wifi in dorm is pretty bad lol. Else like I mentioned, find private accommodation with wifi.

As for the broadband brands you can either get from the mobile providers or get from companies like [YES 4G](https://www.yes.my/4g-broadband). I can't comment on the speed of broadband as i have no experience with them except one company few years ago, which had bad coverage and speed. All of them are definitely usable as you will be in town area. Just get whichever you want.

Edit: [Umobile Broadband](http://www.u.com.my/postpaid_broadband) [Maxis Broadband](https://www.maxis.com.my/en/personal/internet/maxis-fibre-internet.html#mop-fibre-plan) [Digi Broadband](http://new.digi.com.my/broadband) ",2016-09-06 06:50:18+00:00,d7b87mj,3.0,t1_d7aetlb,50491.0,malaysia

28,"I'll give it a try

1. Most college accommodations are nearer to college compared to private residence. Usually college accommodations will be more expensive. A lot of my friends in private accommodation because my university's accommodation is super expensive.

2. No idea. I do not go to KL for food.

3. There are Jusco, Tesco, Giant, Carrefour, BIG(publika), Mydin. Personally prefer Tesco but all of them are generally good. Prices may differ between supermarkets. Just go to anywhere convenient.

4. No idea about KL but I usually go to Publika or Mont Kiara area. 

5. Cooking yourself might be more expensive than eating out if you are alone. All of my friends who are foreigners or from other states do not cook themselves. Malaysia food are cheap.

6. It really depends on how your college teaches. I can just bring a tablet to my university for the lectures. Definitely get papers, a lot of them to record down notes or get notebooks.

7. Personally use Umobile because it is the cheapest in the market for now. Coverage is not bad for the locations I usually travel to. I consider the top 4 here to be Maxis, Celcom, Digi and Umobile. (no definite order)

8. I believe college accommodations should have wifi. If not, you can either get broadband for non- heavy user. If you game, getting broadband will not be recommended. It will be better if you can install Unifi as it has unlimited data and usually stable. The downside is you have to drill holes at the accommodation which is usually not allowed. Or just find a accommodation with proper wifi installed.

9. Definitely must go to Penang and Melaka for their historical buildings and food. Ipoh for food. Tripadvisor will always be your friend for traveling.

10. Never used Uber but I can assure you government taxi services sucked big time (personal experience). I have been hearing only good things for Uber and also Grab.

11. Pretty similar to Hong Kong or Taiwan. Buy tickets at counter or the machine and just go to the correct platform to get on the trains. There are also Touch N Go, which is a card where you preload money that can be used on busses and trains. Similar to what they offer in Hong Kong or Taiwan. Bus in Malaysia sucks.

12. Just beware of theives. If you are female try not to walk alone on empty streets especially in town.
