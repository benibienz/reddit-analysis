I am a 23yo Malaysian Male going to Japan on 21st Nov to 2nd Dec this year. I followed this subreddit for a few weeks and read through a lot of guides. I more or less know what to do when I am there. However, I hope to get comments on my itinerary to see if I over-planned or under-planned or badly planned. Below is my itinerary.

Note that ""itinerary revised"" is mapped on goggle maps in order for ease of visit.


I am not sure yet will i go around Hakone or just stay in ryokan when i visit Hakone. Will decide during the trip.

[Detailed Itinerary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fwpi5pOrMMWRPCPbOsrC8IzEob29WO0I0COEZ_d1PNo/edit?usp=sharing)
Note that detailed itinerary includes Nikko which i taken out because of budget.



[Budget planning](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MURDnGR-H4zEGRXyhchbUXIjl-gNERUjCSMivOj8Qt4/edit?usp=sharing)
Note that budget also includes Nikko which I removed. But it is good enough to get an idea how much i will use.



Thank you and sorry for my english.

It just says ""no live  channel"" but if I manually use the streamer's url. I can watch their stream. Not sure how this happened but these are what i tried. Somehow i can see live games if I am using my university's internet connection but not my personal connection.
