116,"I said this is what autism ""looks like"" the point being it is an invisible disability and has no look!! When my daughter is having a good day and looks like most other kids but her behavior isnt typical for a child her size or age people often tell her off and when i explain say ""oh she doesnt look autistic"" this was in response to that. It is generally obvious my child has special needs as she looks ill with sleep deprivation and lack of eating, she requires a special needs pram and her behavior is not typical of a 7 year olds and given she is the size of a 9 year old its more obvious. My point is people dont see her being restrained or etc. How can you say she has ""mild autism"" because of a few photos where she looks well. this is exactly my point, it is a hidden disability along with schizophrenia, ADHD, ODD, PDA, SPD, epilepsy, an many more. The post was to highlight this and the responses were shocking in that people still ignored that point. It's a spectrum condition. I know kids who would be ""severe"" who are much happier than those with ""HF"". If you know one person on teh spectrum you know one. You can't tell unless you are living it.

She explains this to other kids and the response is amazing, they understand better than most adults. The ADHD she has to take medication for, she knows it helps her concentrate otherwise she can't play xbox and is a danger to herself. She can't actually hold a conversation if not medicated.

At the same time her epilepsy consultant changed and they picked up on the ASD within 5 minutes of meeting her, she was then put on a waiting list for over a year and diagnosed after an hour assessment.

The best sex is with someone you're comfortable with, you can talk about sex and laugh about it too. You are both willing to try new things and you both have similar desires.
There needs to be give and take, (no pun intended) sometimes you have to put yourself out there, you can't expect a blow job if you aren't going to go down on a girl. 
Also with things like oral sex communication is key, don't be afraid to give direction and dont be afraid to take it either!! There's no point putting someones dick in your mouth if they aren't enjoying it.

Getting good at sex takes time, you need to build your confidence and once you do you will enjoy it much more. Don't be afraid to enjoy yourself. You'd be amazed at what others do behind closed doors.

392,"It's estimated that 40-60% of people with ADHD also have SPD (sensory processing disorder) 

Unfortunately in my experience ADHD medications do nothing to relieve this. However taking simple steps to recognize when you are struggling and preparing for it is half the battle. Simple things like bringing ear plugs or ear defenders if you're going somewhere that may be overwhelmingly noisy. Keeping a tissue with lavender oil or a scent you like can help when there's a bad smell in public.  

You really just need to realistic. Don't expect too much of yourself but these are things you can work on and if you can't fix it then don't put yourself in the situation unnecessarily. If you don't like wearing bras don't ever feel you have to because society expects it. You'll find people will say ""oh yea i hate that too"" but it's not the same, it doesn't drive them insane and niggle at them for forever. Don't be afraid to tell other people either if they are doing something that is making you miserable.

Look into sensory overload or sensory seeking and try to plan ahead. What can you do in these situations? There's so many people with similar issues and there's a lot of information out there to help ",2015-09-18 14:47:13+00:00,cv5w1n8,1,t3_3lfcfm,7554,ADHD
