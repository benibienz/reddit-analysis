This is something posted regularly online and often too are posts about grieving a child.
While I understand why people post this to express their emotions, I think it’s time to talk about the language we use.
Personally I didn’t grieve for my child as such and the poem Welcome to Holland certainly helped. I was overwhelmed at first mention of ASD and I did need time to think about perusing diagnosis, I was more afraid of labeling my child and how a label would impact her in future and honestly I panicked a bit before I rationalized it. Autism was only going to be diagnosed if my child was in fact autistic, a label wasn’t going to change that part of who she is but it would offer explanation.
It was a 12 month wait for the ADOS assessment so by the day of the assessment I had figured a diagnosis was just a way to better understand my child and potentially myself. I had done my homework and this felt right, I was more concerned about her not meeting the criteria because then what?
Honestly I was relieved to get confirmation and yes a label.
I didn't feel grief but I did feel overwhelmed.
I felt anxious of the unknown.
I felt like I was beginning a new journey and I had to remind myself that it was the same journey I had been on for the past 6 years. The only difference was I now knew for certain we were in Holland.
Don’t get me wrong I know the challenges ASD can present but autism is just one of many words used to describe my child and it is my child that can be hilarious not her diagnosis, autism does not define her but is a part of her. It is part of her composition just as her eyes are green, her hair is brown, she is autistic.
What it boils down to is this. I love my child and I cannot hate autism because it is a part of who my child is. I can be overwhelmed by her behaviour sure or overwhelmed with worry, I can be frustrated and I can be distressed after a difficult day but I couldn’t hate autism any more than I could hate her green eyes and I would be distraught if she ever said she hated autism, because in essence what it would mean is she has come to hate a part of herself.
I just think the language we use is important and this is my sentiment.
I can hate how hard a day has been, I can hate the challenges my daughter has to face, I can be upset that life can be so overwhelming for her.
But I just cannot hate autism.",autism,Why I can't hate autism,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/4c6ry3/why_i_cant_hate_autism/
