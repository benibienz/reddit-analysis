0,"This is a fantasy series where the main character finds himself transported to an alternate world of magic. In the real world he is shunned by society because he has Leprosy. In the alternate world his white gold wedding ring is infused with ""wild magic,"" and he is pitted against an evil sorcerer. 

The author wrote Covenant as mentally unbalanced, and he spends the majority of his time attempting to disprove the reality of the alternate world he finds himself in (believing it to be a figment of his imagination) and foisting responsibility to save the universe onto other characters in the series.

A good literary tactic to generate suspense is to stack the odds against the protagonist; the reader keeps reading to find out how the hero wins out despite the hurdles. Covenant's constant internal struggle with mental illness was supposed to be such a tactic, but rather than someone fighting a disability, he came across to me as tiresome and whiny.

Ultimately, it just pissed me off that someone who had the power to oppose evil chose not to because he didn't think it was real. ",2016-11-19 21:33:49+00:00,da7egdb,3.0,t1_da7c3mg,3516,books

Besides, if, as Pence claims, the document in question is indeed attorney work product, then he is OBLIGATED to keep it confidential.

34,"You've got it all wrong. Here's a quote from the article:

&gt;we were expected to entertain the fantasy that a person could vote for Trump without voting for racism, for xenophobia, for rape culture 

I've been hearing for the past six months left-wing pundits wail about ""equivalence."" ""Trump and Clinton are both bad candidates, but they are not equally bad."" Are there are some actual racicsts and sexists among Trump supporters? Absolutely. But they are not ALL rasicts. And labeling someone a racist BECAUSE they voted for Trump is exactly the problem with political correctness. It's this terrible idea that there is no gray area, no nuance, no extenuating circumstance; the you're-either-for-us-or-you're-against-us mentality. There's a difference between an actual racist and someone who voted for Trump despite his racist ranting because they couldn't bear the thought of electing, as Glenn Greenwald described her,  ""a deeply unpopular, extremely vulnerable, scandal-plagued candidate, who—for very good reason—was widely perceived to be a protector and beneficiary of all the worst components of status quo elite corruption."" Exit polling suggested some 8% of Democratic voters voted for Trump for this very reason.

If you don't think people who didn't want to vote for either Clinton or Trump were swayed by being labeled racist and sexist for even CONSIDERING voting for Trump then you've got another think coming.

First thing I did when I got there was hop into the shower to clean my stinking ass (was working a landscaping job at the time). The bathroom in Gram's house is this glorious tile affair, liberally adorned with full-length mirrors. 

As I was rinsing I caught sight of myself in one of the mirrors through the glass shower door. Don't ask me why—narcissism?—maybe the combination of hot soapy suds, the warm water spritzing on my genitals and a naked body really revved me up, so I did what comes naturally. 

As I got going I noticed this particular mirror made things seem larger than they really are, so I opened the shower door to get a better look. With no light in the actual shower stall I was in a bit of shadow, so I stepped out on the tile floor to get better lighting.

54,"Research shows most people who quit successfully quit cold turkey. Success is defined as not using tobacco for at least one year after quitting. On average, those who are successful try seven times before attaining success, so you should expect setbacks.

Symptoms of physical addiction will subside almost entirely after three days. The next biggest problem is the habits: You answer the phone, you light up; you get in your car, you light up; you have a cup of coffee you light up. Find a way to change your habits: hold your phone in your other hand, or use a bluetooth earpiece; get your car detailed and/or let your SO drive; use/stop using cream and sugar in your coffee, or switch to tea or some other beverage.

What gets most people in the end is the psychological aspect. You've seen the old movie trope where the person who hasn't smoked for years suddenly starts again after some stressful life-changing event. That's not inaccurate. Smoking is a source of stress relief for most smokers, so when you get really stressed you'll feel an exceptionally strong urge to light up. The key is to have a plan in place, because you KNOW you will get stressed about something sometime in the future. 

Some ideas: Write a list of all the things you do that bring you joy. Decide that when you get stressed you will do everything on the list (or as much as practical) before lighting up. Make an agreement with someone you trust that you can call anytime who will help. Have a plan in place detailing how you will deal with the aftermath of a slip up. Many quitters who give in and have a smoke during a stressful period decide that's it, they're back to smoking. THAT'S NOT SO UNLESS YOU DECIDE IT'S SO! If you understand you will likely make mistakes and plan for them (reaffirm to yourself your commitment to quit; talk with someone who knows you are trying to quit to get some encouragement, be willing to start over, etc.) you don't have to give up ALL the gains you've made. Above all, understand each slip up is an opportunity to understand the kinds of situations that can trigger you to smoke and either avoid them, or have a plan to deal with them.

76,"&gt;And only the government can do that.

Not necessarily true. If we got insurance out of the sniffles and scrapes business CONSUMERS could do the same thing. Insurance has been twisted in the healthcare market to cover EVERYTHING. Imagine if your car insurance covered all the routine maintence too. How much do you think an oil change would cost if you weren't paying directly for it?

Insurance should cover the cost of catastrophic illness/injury; everything else should be out of pocket cost. Consider this example: Your kid injurs her ankle playing soccer. You take her to your doc just to be sure nothing's broken. Your doc says the only way to be sure is an MRI, which costs $10,000. Under the insurance-covers-everything paradigm your first question is, ""Am I covered?"" instead of, ""Is it necessary?"" If your insurance covers it of course you'll get the MRI. But the reality is if you just take your kid home and have her take it easy for a few days she'll either start to feel better, in which case the ankle wasn't broken, or she won't, in which case you'll need to take her back in for a further evaluation. Waiting those few days won't matter one bit in the final outcome if her ankle was indeed broken in the first place, but if it wasn't you'll have saved $10,000. And that few extra days gives you some time to shop around to see if you can get an MRI for less money.

The key is if everything is covered by insurance you never even think to ask if you really need something; your doctor says you should do it so you do it.

EDIT: An example of medical services not covered by insurance is the vision correction surgery business. When this procedure first came out it was very expensive, and the percentage of people experiencing post-surgery negative side effects was significant. Over the years costs have come down significantly, and advances in procedures and techniques have greatly reduced the expectation of negative side effects. LASIK is not covered by most insurance plans. How much do you think it would cost if it was?",2016-11-01 13:26:15+00:00,d9gr6md,2.0,t1_d9ghtoy,27590,news

81,"&gt;Firstly, investigation ≠ wrongdoing. 

Then where's the harm in Director Comey releasing the fact he's investigating?

**EDIT**: I see I'm getting downvoted, but I'm asking a serious question. Clearly an investigation doesn't equal wrongdoing. OP knows this; I know this; those reading clearly know it. Are you suggesting the average voter doesn't know this? I think that's pretty arrogant. I'll submit that even if this investigation turns up new evidence that could lead to a criminal indictment it won't change the minds of people who are voting for Hillary primarily to prevent a Trump presidency, just as revelations of Trump's proclivity towards sexual assault didn't really hurt his poll numbers all that much.

This overreaction on the part of the press (and those who fear above all else a Trump presidency) is a pretty good indicator of just how weak a candidate Hillary Clinton is, no?

&gt;Secondly, if a candidate is being investigated, the press will ferret it out without the FBI turning into the National Enquirer and disseminating was is essentially unproven gossip.

Once again, if the National Enquirer is going to ferret it out anyway, then where's the harm in Director Comey beating it to the punch? Leaking of information regarding ongoing investigations has been happening for a long, long time. 

For example, in the weeks leading up to the last election administration officials ""leaked"" the ""fact"" that the attack on the US Diplomatic Compound in Libya had been prompted by an idiotic YouTube video, and that was before ANY investigation had occurred. Obama was crowing the fact no major terrorist attacks had been perpetrated on the United States under his administration, so this was a rather artful deflection of blame. Good leak, or bad leak?

83,"[Obligatory repost](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1rgpdf/what_is_the_laziest_thing_youve_ever_done/):

I was once on a US military ship, having breakfast in the wardroom (officers lounge) when the Operations Officer (OPS) walks in. This guy was the definition of NOT a morning person; he's still half asleep, bleary eyed... basically a zombie with a bagel. He sits down across from me to eat his bagel and is just barely conscious. My back is to the outboard side of the ship, and the morning sun is blazing in one of the portholes putting a big bright-ass circle of light right on his barely conscious face. He's squinting and chewing and basically just remembering how to be alive for today. It's painful to watch.

But then zombie-OPS stops chewing, slowly picks up the phone, and dials the bridge. In his well-known I'm-still-totally-asleep voice, he says ""heeeey. It's OPS. Could you... shift our barpat... yeah, one six five. Thanks."" And puts the phone down. And then he just sits there. Squinting. Waiting.

And then, ever so slowly, I realize that that big blazing spot of sun has begun to slide off the zombie's face and onto the wall behind him. After a moment it clears his face and he blinks slowly a few times and the brilliant beauty of what I've just witnessed begins to overwhelm me. By ordering the bridge to adjust the ship's back-and-forth patrol by about 15 degrees, he's changed our course just enough to reposition the sun off of his face. He's literally just redirected thousands of tons of steel and hundreds of people so that he could get the sun out of his eyes while he eats his bagel. I am in awe.

He slowly picks up his bagel and for a moment I'm terrified at the thought that his own genius may escape him, that he may never appreciate the epic brilliance of his laziness (since he's not going to wake up for another hour). But between his next bites he pauses, looks at me, and gives me the faintest, sly grin, before returning to gnaw slowly on his zombie bagel.",2016-10-31 17:28:23+00:00,d9flzel,1.0,t3_5abm5q,23001,AskReddit

I agree to a certain extent, but also because most can't stomach the thought of Hillary Clinton as president, and that a vote for a third-party candidate is as good as a vote for Clinton.

This is part of what I mean when I say we are ALL partly responsible for Trump. If Democrats had been able to field pretty much any candidate other than Clinton I believe Trump's campaign would've imploded months ago.

He didn't think he'd been speeding, so he was curious to find out why he'd been stopped. The CA trooper got out of his cruiser, walked up to the gleaming Datsun and just stared for a few minutes. He then walked around the car, scratching his head, his eyes ranging back and forth over the body work. My friend thought, ""Oh, he just wants to know what kind of car it is!""

The cop stops at the driver's window, which my friend had already rolled down, and asked, ""Is this a Porsche?""

My friend chuckled and said, ""No, it's a Datsun.""

""Yeah, a Datsun. It's the new 240Z.""

""A Datsun? I've never seen a Datsun that looks like this.""

""Yeah, it's new.""

146,"&gt;I don't like you so I don't recognize my murdering you as being illegal today.

C'mon. Most sovereign citizen advocates lean toward libertarianism, a core tenet of which is no violence outside of self defense. I've never heard a sovereign citizen argue they can kill someone at will simply because they dislike them.

&gt;The law is all or nothing, or it can't work.

Oh really? I wonder what Dr. Martin Luther King might have to say about that?

&gt; “A just law is a man made code that squares with the moral law or the law of God. An unjust law is a code that is out of harmony with the moral law. One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws.”

Oh. So he's saying if one believes a law to be unjust one has a moral obligation to disobey it.

I get it that you think sovereign citizens are kooks, and you disagree with them on laws they've decided are unjust. But I don't think you should just make shit up because you disagree with them. I don't happen to agree with the sovereign citizen movement, but I admire a willingness to risk jail (or other administrative punishment) for what you believe. I'll grant that some of them are probably ignorant of all the issues surrounding their beliefs--as well as the punishments they face, but some of them are not.

One of the things my crew discussed for emergency procedures was that if we knew the plane was going down and we had no hope of surviving we would all disrobe and pile into the latrine together.

197,"Did you read the analysis I linked to? The nationwide overall crime rate for 2016 is expected to remain the same as 2015. While there was a nationwide increase in violent crime this year of around 5%, with half of that attributed to LA &amp; Chicago, violent crime remains near the bottom of the nation's 30-year low. The nationwide murder rate will increase by some 13%, with half of that attributed to Chicago. Other large cities, like Baltimore and Wash DC saw decreases this year. From the executive summary:

&gt;Nationally, the murder rate is projected to increase 31.5 percent from 2014 to 2016 — with half of additional murders attributable to Baltimore, Chicago, and Houston. Since homicide rates remain low nationwide, percentage increases may overstate relatively small increases. In San Jose, for example, just 21 new murders translated to a 66.7 percent increase in the city’s murder rate. Based on this data, the authors conclude there is no evidence of a national murder wave, yet increases in these select cities are indeed a serious problem.

&gt;Very few cities are projected to see crime rise uniformly this year, and only Chicago will see significant, back-to-back increases in both violent crime and murder. The authors attempted to investigate causes of these spikes, but ultimately were unable to draw conclusions due to lack of data. Based on their research, however, the authors believe cities with long-term socioeconomic problems (high poverty, unemployment, and racial segregation) are more prone to short-term spikes in crime. Because the pattern across cities is not uniform, the authors believe these spikes are created by as-of yet unidentified local factors, rather than any sort of national characteristic. Further, it is normal for crime to fluctuate from year-to-year. The increases and decreases in most cities’ murder rates in 2015 and 2016, for example, are within the range of previous two-year fluctuations, meaning they may be normal short-term variations.

227,"&gt; The problem with your assumption is two-fold: you assume that mass famine is impossible because of our technical ingenuity and that we'll come up with a means of restoring Earth to its pre-industrial state.

The problem with this is your assumption about my assumption. :-)

I don't assume ANYTHING is impossible, and I certainly don't assume we'll ever restore the earth to pre-industrial status. 

&gt;Furthermore, we already have great amounts of food today and could easily feed the world as is, but we lack the ability to distribute that food worldwide, and so famines continue to happen even in countries right next door.

That's not factual. We DO have the ability to distribute food worldwide, we lack the will. For example, the world sends more than enough food to famine stricken areas (such as sub-Saharan Africa), but it is often stolen or otherwise lost to local government/bandits (sometimes the same).

&gt;The issue here is that we simply do not have the resources or energy to restore the planet.

We don't have to if we can learn to survive on the planet as is. This is what I believe will happen.

The ""Blackbird"" routinely flew up to 80,000 feet (officially).

Flights above 60,000 feet are in uncontrolled airspace, and therefore do not need a clearance, but you gotta go thru controlled airspace to get there.
The story goes that a newbie air traffic controller got a request for clearance one day from an aircraft using call sign ""Aspen,"" which is what all Blackbirds flying out of Beale AFB used on training missions. (Rough) transcript went as follows:

**Blackbird pilot**: ""Oakland, Aspen 30, requesting clearance to FL 600 (60,000').""

277,"For a couple of reasons. One, I'm looking at Socialism as an economic system. In that regard it says nothing about government-supplied social benefits; that's a political question. State-supplied social welfare is not a requirement of Socialism as an economic system. It is a feature of many prominent--and what many consider to be successful--societies with economies based on Socialism, but it's not necessary as part of an economic system. American's enjoy many social welfare benefits and entitlements provided by the government, and we (supposedly) live in a Capitalist economic system.

Two, Socialism means everyone has (or should have) a say in the how the resources provided by the State are distributed. As a member of the military you have no rights whatsoever--other than the decision to accept the contract--in determining what resources the military provides you. Because of that it's less like a social contract--which is what you are describing--and more like an employment contract.

I don't see the question of a State-required contract as relevant. People are born into whatever society they are born into--and they have no choice but to live by the established rules of those societies. How would a written contract in such a setting have any meaning? What would happen if you choose not to sign a contract? Would your fellow citizens just let you starve because you didn't agree with the terms? Would you be required to leave the country? Where would you go? What if no other country allowed you to immigrate?  ",2016-09-23 14:32:46+00:00,d7yvo1a,12.0,t1_d7yt9pc,3600,AskReddit

279,"No. Socialism is defined as a political and economic theory of social organization where the means of production, distribution, and exchange are owned or regulated by the community as a whole. In other words, democratic ownership/control of resources. The primary goal of such a social structure is to levelize the social hierarchy. First, there is no ""production"" in the military other than the fulfillment of its mission. Second, there is no democracy in the military. Finally, the military has a well-defined, strictly enforced social hierarchy. It is, in fact, a punishable offense under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) for higher ranking individuals to fraternize with lower ranking individuals, even when they are not in each other's chain of command.

You might argue that the military's supplying troops with necessities such as healthcare is social welfare, but I would argue against that as well. For the most part, social welfare places no obligations on recipients. That's not true of members of the military; not doing your job is a punishable offense under the UCMJ.

304,"&gt;Is property a right? 

I don't know; you tell me. Do you have a right to ownership of your own body? Do you have a right to do what you please with your own body? If you legally acquire resources and use your body and your mind to produce something of value from them is it yours?

&gt;Without a government, you would have to use force to protect your own property, making property an inherently violent proposition.

There are ways to protect your property that do not require any force whatsoever. I could hide it, or put it in a vault that would prevent theft from all but the most determined. I could (and do) carry credit cards exclusively, so even if mugged I'm not losing anything. I can avoid crime-ridden areas. Violence is always a last resort.

That aside, saying property ownership makes me invariably violent because of what someone else might do is absurd. You don't say personal safety is an inherently violent proposition because you have to use force to protect yourself from harm, do you?

313,"REPOST: My wife works in a hospital. She told me a story about a patient that presented with constipation (three days) and rectal pain. An examination found he had a rotting cucumber up his ass, which he claimed no knowledge of. Turns out he was not lying.

He had recently returned from an extended trip away from home during which he had contracted a venereal disease, which he had passed along to his wife following his return. Rather than confront him with his misdeeds, his wife decided to go straight to retribution. So she drugged his dinner one night, then administered the coup de concombre, so to speak.

Of all the possible visuals that come to mind when I think of this story, the one that I enjoy most is the wife, at the store, picking out the cucumber. ""Yeah, this is the one...""",2016-08-30 15:26:36+00:00,d72oq5f,1.0,t3_50aw7c,10056,AskReddit

324,"A cub reporter gets his first assignment covering real news (as opposed to kids parties and obits). His editor tells him to hightail it to the local general aviation airport where a pilot in a Cessna is waiting for him. They are to overfly a brushfire currently burning out of control and threatening homes a few miles outside of town.

The reporter grabs his gear, hops in his car and drives like a madman to get to the airport. He parks his car and rushes into the airport office, which happens to be empty. Near panic, thinking he had missed his flight, the reporter looked out the window toward the flightline. He sees an aircraft sitting just outside the door, a pilot in the seat, with the prop turning. He runs out to the ramp, around to the passenger side of the plane. He opens the door, tosses his gear in the back seat and hops in. As he's buckling his seat belt he glances at the pilot and says, ""Let's go!""

The pilot taxis the plane to end of the runway and executes a perfect takeoff. They climb out into a clear blue sky. The weather is beautiful, and visibility is easily 30-40 miles. As they continue upward the reporter notices they are heading away from the smoke. He looks at the pilot and asks,  ""Where are you going?""

The pilot says, ""Uh, I don't know.""

The reporter says, ""What do you mean you don't know. Didn't they tell you I was covering the fire?""

The pilot says, ""Fire? What fire? Aren't you my instructor?""",2016-08-26 17:55:49+00:00,d6xsjmk,1.0,t3_4zoif2,17115,AskReddit
325,"What? C'mon now. There's a point of diminishing returns when it comes to experience. After 1500 hours of professional flight experience (civiian or military) more experience isn't going to make you a better pilot. That goes for nearly anything. Additionally, I would argue that 100 hours of COMBAT experience prepares someone for dealing with an emergency far better than sitting in the seat for 100 hours and monitoring the flight management software as it takes your airliner from here to there.

If you are referring to currency (the amount of RECENT experience) then a civilian pilot who flies more often might have an edge on a military pilot, but that goes away as soon as the military pilot flies and updates their currency.

If you are contemplating flying in a GA plane with someone you know don't ask them how many hours they've flown, ask them how many hours they've flown in the past six months. 50 hours per year is the average, so anything over 25 and you can be reasonably sure your friend is current enough to fly safely.",2016-08-26 17:43:08+00:00,d6xryc0,3.0,t1_d6xeqk2,18274,AskReddit

It may not be their job to teach you how to drive, but given the widely varying ways different manufacturers set up their infotainment systems, it's certainly smart for someone at the dealership to show how to use them.

Similarly, not all Android phones operate the same way. Phones from Verizon have different skins than phones from Sprint, and Verizon's Samsung phones have different skins from their Motorola phones. It is most certainly the job of the retail staff to make their customers aware of the differences and help them learn how to use their new devices.

397,"Thanks for the concern; I don't suffer any ill effects from my military service (other than a vexing inability to sleep later than 6am). 

I see small memorials to US service members like the one in this video all around the country here in the US, and when I do I often take a moment to remember my friends who didn't come home. I can see how someone might be upset that others don't behave with the solemnity such shrines seem to call for.

Then again, if there is such a thing as life after death I would hope that my fallen friends would be happy to see people enjoying themselves, even on such solemn ground. The fact that these young people can't seem to understand the angst of these ""crazy veterans"" means they never experienced the fear and deprivation that comes with actual military conflict, and that is proof positive that my brothers and sisters did not die in vain.",2016-07-30 15:36:30+00:00,d5x8lqq,5.0,t1_d5x860r,785,videos

So help me God.""

Theoretically, the President doesn't use the military unless it's necessary to secure a vital national interest according the US Constitution. To the grunt fighting and dying, (s)he is following the orders of his/her Commander in Chief (the President) whom (s)he faithfully assumes has determined military intervention is necessary to protect and defend the Constitution. 

Obviously, many people disagree how and when use of the US military actually serves our interests, especially in the last half century. If you are among them, however, your disagreement is with the politicians, not the foot soldiers. Service members are obliged to follow a [Code of Conduct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_the_United_States_Fighting_Force), which requires them to refuse unlawful orders, but I think you would agree it would be difficult for an individual to refuse an order based on his/her personal views of geopolitics.

431,"Not specifically a change-a-light-bulb joke--and probably not even true--but nevertheless a good story about light bulbs:

The place is a small regional center town in Soviet Union. The time is early 1980s. A local conference of college teachers is in progress. A few dozens of teachers came into town for the event and a few of them were situated in the local hotel. The hotel is very poor, but so are the teachers and 3 of them take a single room. Since there is not much to do in a small town at night, alcoholic beverages are obtained from a local store and consumed. 

During the conversation among the newly found friends one of the teachers (lets call him Dmitriy) mentions it is a medical fact that it is impossible to take a light bulb out of one's mouth once inserted. This claim meets active disbelief from the others who want to know exactly what kind of bulb, the bulb's dimensions, etc. Their obvious question is if you can put it in why can't you take it out? Dmitriy replies, that he is talking about a standard 100 Watt light bulb such as the one lighting their room, and that he lacks the medical knowledge to explain why you can put one in but not take it out. Discussion heats up, and at some point one of his opponents decides an experiment is necessary. 

Mind you, that all of the teachers in the room are PhDs in various fields of exact science. 

Dmitriy's loudest opponent (lets call him Vladimir) then removes the light bulb from the ceiling and puts it into his mouth. In a few seconds it becomes clear that Dmitriy was right; Vladimir cannot remove the light bulb due to peculiar clenching of jaw muscles. 

After a short discussion the three friends decide to get Vladmir to a doctor. They get out of the hotel, and stop a cab. They drive to the hospital where they have to relate the story of the accident to the night nurse, who, after almost choking herself with giggles, calls the ER doctor. The doctor carefully examines Vladimir, and unexpectedly hits him with his fist in the back of the jaw. Vladimirs jaw falls open and the doctor returns the light bulb to Dmitriy, explaining that Vladimir is not going to be able to use his mouth for a couple of hours due to the over stressed jaw muscles. 

The three teachers get back into a cab and start driving home, when the third teacher starts complaining that the other two are playing him for a fool, that this is medically impossible for such a phenomenon to exist and that he is about to prove it. After he puts the light bulb into his mouth the cab makes a U-turn and speeds back to the hospital. At the hospital, the nurse starts giggling when the three men enter the emergency room, and after hearing their new story falls of her chair laughing. After a little while she calls the surgeon, who chuckles, hits the 3rd teacher in the back of the jaw and removes the light bulb. 

The cab has left, so the three friends catch another. Dmitriy gets into the front seat and puts his mute friends with their jaws hanging open in the back. Cab driver is mildly surprised by the unusual company of an obviously drunk giggling man and two others looking like village idiots, and asks about it. Dmitriy assures the driver the other two are not idiots, but highly educated people and tells of the small argument about a light bulb. After carefully listening to the whole story the driver asks what kind of light bulb is he talking about, and Dmitriy shows the hotel light bulb saying ""this one"". ""Impossible"" says the cab driver and in a few seconds the cab turns around and goes back to the hospital. 

When the nurse sees these guys the 3rd time inside 2 hours, she starts having rather serious breathing difficulties. After getting her in shape Dmitriy makes her call the surgeon who, promptly hitting the cab driver in the jaw takes the light bulb and smashes it on the table saying that this should put an end to the story. The four men get back into the cab and drive to the hotel. 

On the way they are stopped by the road patrol police unit. The policeman is very surprised to find that the only person able to speak in a car full of people is a rather drunk man who tells him a weird story about light bulbs. ""I will be right back"" replies the policeman, goes back to the road side station, Dmitriy and companions watch the light go off inside the station, and in a few seconds the policeman appears again, the metal end of a light bulb sticking out of his mouth. 

The cab goes back to the hospital. The nurse becomes hysterical with joy. After a few minutes of recuperation she goes to the cabinet of the surgeon to call him. She opens the door and falls to the floor unconscious. In the doorway appears the surgeon with his jaw hanging wide open.",2016-07-19 14:08:26+00:00,d5i56rn,1.0,t3_4thkkm,59025,AskReddit

470,"&gt; As a warrior prepares his mind for battle there appears a brief interval, often fleeting as a heartbeat, wherein the inward eye summons the following tripartite vision, often in the selfsame order:
&gt; 
&gt; First to the inmost heart appear the faces of those he loves who do not share his immediate peril: his wife and mother, his children, particularly if they are female, particularly if they are young. These who will remain beneath the sun and preserve within their hearts the memory of his passage, the warrior greets with fondness and compassion. To them he bequeaths his love and to them bids farewell.
&gt; 
&gt; Next arise before the inward eye the shades of those already across the river, they who stand awaiting upon the distant shore of death. These, too, the warrior’s heart greets in silent vision, summons their aid and then releases.
&gt; 
&gt; Lastly advance the gods, whichever a man feels have favored him most, whichever he feels himself most to have favored. Into their care he releases his spirit, if he can.
&gt; 
&gt; Only when this triple obligation has been requited does the warrior revert to the present and turn, as if arising from a dream, to those at his shoulder, they who in a moment will undergo with him the trial of death. Here is where the Spartans most hold advantage over all who face them in battle. Beneath what alien banner could one discover at his shoulder such men as his Peers, men who have shared and lived and become Spartan together, men whose spirits have been stretched and shaped and hammered in the forge of battle? These who will share the ferry with him, the warrior’s heart embraces with a love surpassing all others granted by the gods to humankind, save only that of a mother for her babe. To them he commits all, as they all to him.

507,"The sister mother ""nonsense"" is a way to make a point: the only way the average woman can protect herself from the average man intent on harming her is with a weapon that doesn't depend on her strength. This principle applies even between two men of differing strength. I'm not as young as I used to be, and my physical capacity for self defense is far less than what it once was. That ceases to be an issue if I'm armed.

&gt;Can I own military weapons for self defense? Nuclear weapons? Can I set booby traps in my home or have other automated defenses?

This is a non-sequitur. You are talking about things that are already illegal. I'm not opposed to reasonable limits on the types of weapons individuals may own, but the devil is in the details. For example, the so-called ""assault weapons ban"" that gun control advocates seem to believe would have somehow prevented the Orlando shooting is simply idiotic. Banning scary looking guns doesn't prevent terrorists from killing people (see 9/11, Oklahoma City and the Boston Marathon bombing). 

The difference between us is not my lack of your pragmatism, it's your lack of my trust in other people. I believe the overwhelming majority of people have no desire to harm anyone else. This is born out by the statistics regarding gun ownership and gun violence even here is the Wild West of the United States (i.e. the number of gun crimes committed by legal owners vs the number of legal gun owners). Because of this I trust people to make intelligent decisions about the best way to provide for their own safety. There are any number of reasonable ways to do so, among them the purchase and safekeeping of firearms.",2016-06-16 20:54:15+00:00,d4c4r7q,8.0,t1_d4bzo1j,6181,AskReddit

517,"As a KC-135 Boom Operator during the Gulf War I refueled F-117s almost exclusively. Our unit at Beale AFB assumed the F-117 air refueling support mission when the SR-71 retired. On the first night of the war my crew was tasked as backup to the five crews who had actual missions. During the mission brief our commander showed us the list of targets the Stealth Fighters would be hitting following the air refueling. Fourth from the top was the Bell telephone facility in downtown Baghdad, scheduled for demolition at 3:04am local time. I though ""Holy shit; we're going to bomb Ma Bell!"" Following the brief, we preflighted our jet and waitied until all five of the other tankers were airborne, then we returned to our barracks (Eskan Village, near Riyadh).

Once back in our billets, we turned on the TV. The Sony corporation (or so we'd been told) had been generous enough to supply us with a satelitte system and televisions for all the barracks, on which we able to get the major networks and and CNN. We we're going to watch the news to see if there were any reports about the air raid on Baghdad. I remember Tom Brokaw was speaking with his Baghdad correspondent (can't remember his name) on the telephone when I looked at my watch: 3:02am. I remembered the target list, and said, ""Guys, we are about to get some real-time BDA (bomb damage assessment)."" Sure as shit, at 3:04:15, the Baghdad guy was cut off in mid-sentence; Brokaw said, ""We seem to have lost the connection to Baghdad."" No shit, Tom.

The following night was my first actual, no-shit operational air refueling mission. I was hyped. Our receivers were two  F-117s going back to Baghdad. Tonight the Stealth Fighters would not have the advantage of total surprise. As we offloaded fuel to the first fighter I mentioned our real-time BDA from the night before to the Stealth Fighter pilot. Here's the exchange:

ME: ""Whoever took out Ma Bell was only 15 seconds late.""

HIM: ""Whaddya mean late? That was me, I was right on time.""

ME: ""Well, I got a good time hack at the mission brief, and we were watching the news in real time. The phone lines went deat at 3:04:15.""

592,"&gt;What you consider ""just political"" is in my view a stance on who deserves to live and who doesn't.

Politicians in America decided some 60 years ago to declare ""War on Poverty."" Up to that point poverty rates had been steadily declining for decades. Since then we have engaged in a massive transfer of wealth from the so-called ""haves"" to the ""have nots."" Tell me how this has it helped the poor. Ignorance kills far more people in American than lack of resources, and despite a tripling of expenditures on education in America since the 1970s (not to mention spending more per student than many countries whose children perform better academically than ours), we still can't eradicate it. What does that mean? You are so convinced at the moral superiority of your opinions that you think only greed and ignorance inform any that differ from them. This despite the fact there is credible evidence to suggest the policies you espouse may actually be detrimental to those you wish to help. Go figure...

Money is not the answer to every problem. I make no claim to know what the answer is, but I'm positive based on America's experiences over the past half century that money isn't it.

&gt;...it tells me that you can change for the better...

Which, of course, means thinking more like yourself. What an arrogant ass you are.

603,"From Steven Pressfield's *Gates of Fire*:

&gt;*As a warrior prepares his mind for battle there appears a brief interval, often fleeting as a heartbeat, wherein the inward eye summons the following tripartite vision, often in the selfsame order:*

&gt;*First to the inmost heart appear the faces of those he loves who do not share his immediate peril: his wife and mother, his children, particularly if they are female, particularly if they are young. These who will remain beneath the sun and preserve within their hearts the memory of his passage, the warrior greets with fondness and compassion. To them he bequeaths his love and to them bids farewell.*

&gt;*Next arise before the inward eye the shades of those already across the river, they who stand awaiting upon the distant shore of death. These, too, the warrior’s heart greets in silent vision, summons their aid and then releases.*

&gt;*Lastly advance the gods, whichever a man feels have favored him most, whichever he feels himself most to have favored. Into their care he releases his spirit, if he can.*

&gt;*Only when this triple obligation has been requited does the warrior revert to the present and turn, as if arising from a dream, to those at his shoulder, they who in a moment will undergo with him the trial of death. Here is where the Spartans most hold advantage over all who face them in battle. Beneath what alien banner could one discover at his shoulder such men as his Peers, men who have shared and lived and become Spartan together, men whose spirits have been stretched and shaped and hammered in the forge of battle? These who will share the ferry with him, the warrior’s heart embraces with a love surpassing all others granted by the gods to humankind, save only that of a mother for her babe. To them he commits all, as they all to him.*

And that would be true if all else remained the same. Without the power of government backing them, however, corporations would have to keep their customers happy. In a capitalist system there are far fewer barriers to starting a new business, so if a corporation isn't meeting its customer's needs someone will start a new corporation that will. That doesn't happen today because regulations (in part) make competitive startups nigh impossible. For proof, compare the industry segments that are most heavily regulated with those least regulated. How often do you hear of a new bank startup, or hospital? How about new lawn care businesses?

So the question becomes what do you believe would be a more effective way for the will of the people to be acted upon?

On the day I was born
The nurses all gathered 'round
And they gazed in wide wonder
At the joy they had found
The head nurse spoke up
Said ""leave this one alone""
She could tell right away
That I was bad to the bone

I broke a thousand hearts
Before I met you
I'll break a thousand more, baby
Before I am through
I wanna be yours pretty baby
Yours and yours alone
I'm here to tell ya honey
That I'm bad to the bone

I make a rich woman beg
I'll make a good woman steal
I'll make an old woman blush
And make a young girl squeal
I wanna be yours pretty baby
Yours and yours alone

**cap·i·tal·ism** –

*an economic and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit, rather than by the state.*

**so·cial·ism**

*a political and economic theory of social organization that advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole.*

*policy or practice based on the political and economic theory of socialism.*

*(in Marxist theory) a transitional social state between the overthrow of capitalism and the realization of communism.*

Clearly, there are many different views regarding the relationship between control of capital and market economics. I don't see how anyone can argue, however, that socialism cedes control of capital–and ultimately markets–to politicians.

The latest political fad here on Reddit seems to be supporting Bernie Sanders in his bid to bring the miracle of Democratic Socialism here to America. What no one seems to be thinking about is the next wave of politicians who get all the power Bernie would bequeath to them. What would a Ted Cruz or a Hillary Clinton do with the market control Bernie wants government to have? They're all people, which means there are no angels, whether they are trying to sell you products or ideas. 

In my mind, the bottom line is individuals already have very little control over their own destinies. Ultimately, we may vote either at the polls or with our wallets. Cede control of markets to government and you take away one of the primary powers individuals have to shape their communities. We've already dumbed down our political system to the point that people end up voting for the lesser of two evils, and given politicians so much power they can in some cases pick and choose which businesses succeed and fail *despite* market forces. Now we want to take away individual market power altogether?

875,"Aircraft design, like any design exercise, is a game of trade offs. Moving the engine from the front to back results in a host of other changes involving weight and balance, aerodynamic stability and ultimately, aircraft control. 

Stability is at the heart of aircraft control. Ideally, you want an aircraft that tracks straight (left/right as well as up/down) through the air with hands off the controls. Traditional tractor configurations (engine in front) make it easy to keep the center of gravity forward of the center of lift, and place pitch/yaw control surfaces (which make the nose go up/down &amp; left/right) on the tail. This is an inherently stable configuration. Here's why:

Having the center of gravity forward of the center of lift means the tail is always holding the nose up, with the center of lift the fulcrum point. Imagine holding an airplane with a string on each wingtip. For the purposes of this discussion the string represents the center of lift, or the average of all lifting force created by the wing. This is what holds the aircraft in the air. The weight of the engine on the nose typically places the center of gravity (CG) forward of the center of lift, the airplane will hang with the nose lower than the tail. In level flight, the air going over the horizontal tail surface will push down on the tail holding the nose up. Changing the angle of the horizontal control surface (elevator) provides an easy means of controlling pitch (nose up/down). Yaw control (nose left/right) is achieved by changing the angle of the vertical control surface (rudder). 

Since the aircraft must balance properly, the tail of the aircraft is usually much longer than the nose, giving the control surfaces a large lever. This means control surfaces can be smaller without sacrificing control authority. 

One of the primary contributing factors for a main wing stall (when it ceases to produce lift) is too slow an airspeed. Should the main wing stall (imagine cutting the strings) in a tractor configuration the forward CG automatically pulls the nose down, immediately increasing the speed of the wind over the wing, thereby breaking the stall. In the most stable single-engine tractor designs stall recovery can be achieved by simply releasing the controls and allowing the aircraft to recover on its own.

In addition, having the engine in front with the wing and control surfaces in the rear makes for a self stabilizing system, because everything wants to streamline behind the prop pulling the structure through the air. With a pusher configuration, everything is in front of the engine, and there is no inherent streamlining tendency. Image carrying a sheet of plywood outdoors with a breeze. Would it be easier to control the plywood by pulling it against the wind, or pushing it into the wind?

In a traditional tractor configuration, with the wing and control surfaces trying to streamline behind the prop, the tail tends to automatically stabilize the aircraft with the wing at the proper angle necessary to produce lift.

With a pusher configuration control surfaces do not want to inherently streamline, making it harder to design in stability.",2015-10-29 14:35:48+00:00,cwh6329,1.0,t3_3qkuyf,79427,askscience

902,"Back in my early Air Force days I served with a navigator whose Dad bought him a Rolex as a gift. Prior to just about any flying related activity we had to do a time hack, where everyone on the crew would synchronize their watches to the US Naval Observatory clock. The nav would dick around and dick around with his Rolex to get it set perfectly (he was a navigator anyway) while the rest of us would sit and roll our eyes. I had an el cheapo $10 Casio that would keep a pretty good hack for around a month or so before I had to set it. It would piss him off no end for me to lean over and show him my Casio was right on the money while he futzed with his expensive Rolex.

One day I looked at my watch during the time hack and its display was blank. The nav looked on smugly as I took it off, shook it and held it up to my ear to check for any signs of life. ""My watch never dies; it winds itself,"" he crowed. 

I looked my Nav square in the eye as I tossed my Casio in the trash. His glee turned to disbelief and he said, ""Why'd you do that?""

Preparation:

Slice roll in half and broil in toaster oven until lightly browned (I don't use toast setting, because I like the crust of the roll to remain soft). Put meat on one half of the roll and cheese on the other. Broil again until cheese melts. Add lettuce, tomato and condiments.

*EDIT: To those implying I misunderstood or was misinformed by another's interpretation of Eisenhower's farewell speech, I don't think so. He spoke of the military-industrial complex that existed at the time, and expressed his fears of the one we might become. One in which the ""acquisition of unwarranted influence"" results in a ""disastrous rise of misplaced power."" One in which the citizens lose interest in ensuring the proper ""meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals."" One in which ""a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity."" One in which the nation's scholars are ""dominat[ed]...by Federal employment, project allocations, and the power of money."" One in which we ""live only for today, plundering, for our own ease and convenience, the precious resources of tomorrow."" One in which we ""mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren"" thereby ""risking the loss also of their political and spiritual heritage.""

So he grabs a pitcher of water and fills the jar to the brim, saying, “If this jar is your life, what does this experiment show you?” A bold student replies, “No matter how busy you think you are, you can always take on more.” “That is one view,” he replies.

1039,"&gt;If a felon is about to flee on his vehicle, you do what you lawfully can to stop them before they further put the lives of others in danger.

First, cops shoot suspects when the cops *think* suspects have a gun, because, cops say, a cop's first responsibility is to get home safely. Fair enough. If that's the case then, needlessly endangering yourself by reaching into a moving vehicle seems counter to that maxim.

Second, the police officer never saw Dubose's license, so how did he know Dubose was a felon? Further (AFAIK), Dubose's only felony conviction was for weed trafficking; not exactly your typical ""violent"" felon.

None of that really matters, however. I've since watched this video much more carefully. Unlike the incident involving Michael Brown, whose supporters claimed Brown's hands were raised when he was shot, both of Dubose's hands **are** clearly raised when he is shot. What's more, the car didn't start moving until *after* Dubose was shot. The officer's report (both the verbal one made to his fellow officer on the scene and the official written one) stated he shot Dubose because he was being dragged.

This squares with what the Hamilton County prosecutor's office is saying:

http://gawker.com/video-of-sam-duboses-death-drastically-different-from-t-1720896658

For whatever reason, this cop made a mistake that cost someone their life. We can argue whether what he did warrants a murder charge, but lying about what happened makes him look very guilty.",2015-07-31 01:24:39+00:00,ctm9uec,13.0,t1_ctm1jz8,13875,news
1040,"I don't agree with any comments on what the cop was feeling or thinking; who can possibly know other than the cop? Rather, let's assume the cop really was alarmed over Mr. Dubose's behavior/actions. Was his reaction appropriate? Did this cop do anything to increase his own danger? I understand it's a cop's duty to put him/herself in situations a civilian would consider too dangerous, but why would reach inside a car if you believed the driver is attempting to drive away, or if you believed the driver is reaching for a weapon? Wouldn't you step back and give yourself more room/time to evaluate the situation?

By all means, draw your weapon if you believe the person you are interacting with might be a threat, but shouldn't you also be looking for ways to defuse a situation so as to avoid having to pull your weapon? He pulled this guy over, so presumably he already had a license plate.

1043,"&gt;Finding data you did not intend to collect is practically a tradition in science.

Right. But scientists who don't have an agenda make it clear they are using repurposed data in their findings. Why didn't Lisak?

&gt;...and it's clear you don't have any experience in this field or with publishing for science.

I don't need to be a scientist or have published a scientific paper to understand the concepts of honesty, transparency and repeatability.

&gt;It isn't helpful, and it only slows progress. The last time anyone thought that it was helpful was in the 40s.

And maybe that pendulum needs to swing back the other way. Scientists (and interested observers) have been warning for years the peer review process is broken. A quick Google search turns up a slew of articles in the science community discussing the poor quality of scientific research.

I asked if the others were also Lisak’s doctoral students during that time. ""Yes, probably,"" he said.

He said he was unable to recall who investigated the previous studies until prompted. That's an inability to answer a basic question.

&gt;When I asked how he was able to speak with men participating in an anonymous survey for research he was not conducting, he ended the phone call.

That's either an inability to answer a basic question, or a refusal to do so.

Ken looked down at her for a moment, then just sat absently stroking her until the movie was over.

A C-141 military transport makes an unscheduled stop at Thule Air Base in Greenland for a maintenance issue. While getting that worked, the pilot, a Captain, requested ground servicing of the plane's lavatory; it was full and the manifest included a load of passengers.

An Airman shows up with a truck to service the lavatory, but being as it's Thule Greenland in the winter, with the temperature hovering around -40F, the hose on the truck is frozen, so the Airman has to return to his unit to get another truck. A few minutes later the maintenance problem is fixed, and now the crew is waiting only on the ground servicing. I should mention, the stop has put the crew behind schedule, so the pilot is antsy to get going. Eventually, some 40 minutes later, the Airman returns and begins the waste-removal process.

The pilot is already pissed that things have taken so long, so now he's watching everything the Airman does like a hawk. While he's getting the job done, the pilot doesn't feel the Airman is demonstrating the proper level of alacrity, so he goes down to have a chat.

The pilot tells the Airman he's unhappy with the speed of service, and that he believes the Airman should step it up a bit. The Airman replies that he's doing the job as fast as he can. He says it's not his fault the equipment froze, but he'll get things done and get the crew on its way as fast as he can. The pilot now feels the Airman hasn't shown the proper level of respect and asks for the name of Airman's supervisor.

The Airman squints at the Captain through the fur surrounding the hood of his parka and says, ""Captain, I got one stripe. I wanted to go to Florida and they sent me to Greenland. My chances of getting a date for the next year are non-existent. It's forty below zero and I'm standing outside pumping shit out of an airplane.

The fact that Medicare is going broke doesn't seem to be in dispute. My original question still stands: What is wrong with exploring different ideas to prevent that from happening?

&gt;So...they're allocating less money but it's neither a cut nor a reduction in spending?

Example: This year I spent $1,500 on gas for my car. My initial plan for next year calls for a gas budget increase to $1,800. If a later revision reduces the planned increase to only $1,600 I I still increased spending for next year's gas budget by $100. I have not cut the gas budget, nor will spend less on gas next year. So while I may have cut the planned increase in spending, I did not cut actual spending.

&gt;Is this the new math conservatives want taught in schools?

You don't know anything about me other than I asked a question. How do you know I'm a conservative?

The fact is if Medicare is fully funded in its current form it stands to become one of the largest transfers of wealth in the history of the world, from relatively poor young people to relatively rich old people. The benefits baby boomers will reap from Medicare as it exists far, far outstrip the amount they paid into it. The only way the program will remain solvent is to drastically cut defense or other entitlements, increase taxes on current workers or, more likely, both. I personally don't have a problem with cutting defense spending; the so-called ""War on Terror"" is a farce. 

I DO have a problem with increasing taxes on poorer young people to pay for Medicare for richer old people. If you don't have a problem with that fine. I'd like to look at other options before that becomes inevitable...",2015-07-25 03:41:30+00:00,ctfdjom,7.0,t1_ctfbt8f,3746,politics

1119,"The fact the F-35 may not be the best dogfighting aircraft means nothing in the grand scheme of things. American airmen have faced superior enemy aircraft in the past, and devised strategies and tactics to nullify the enemy's advantages.

For example, in order to engage the F-35 in a turning dogfight you first have to find it. US pilots flying the F-35 will enjoy all the benefits of stealth technology coupled with superior air-to-air radar and data linking with other ground/air radar platforms. This will enable detection/identification of enemy aircraft at distances far beyond visual range. If you destroy them before they can see you then a dogfight advantage is moot.

A historical example is the P-38 Lightning, the F-35's namesake. In the Pacific Theater the P-38 faced the Japanese Zero, a vastly more maneuverable aircraft in a dogfighting scenario. Yet the P-38 was used successfully in a bomber escort role. Why? Because while the P-38 was overmatched by the Zero in maneuverability, it was faster in a straight line, had a better climb rate and service ceiling than the Zero. So, you control the engagements by entering the fight at a higher altitude than your opponent and make high-speed attack passes, followed by a rapid climb back to altitude, never giving the enemy pilot the opportunity to engage you in a turning fight.

Knowing the relative strengths and weaknesses of your and your enemy's aircraft informs the development of tactics that can nullify any performance disadvantages. I don't see this news as anything to fret about.",2015-06-30 13:54:35+00:00,csnikmd,2.0,t1_csnetrd,10128,worldnews

1128,"77% of the slowdown was attributed to the economic slump. Obamacare was not mentioned as a factor in the other 23%. Indeed, the report concluded the bulk of cost-saving measures are hoped to reduce future costs. [You can read the Kaiser report yourself](http://kff.org/health-costs/issue-brief/assessing-the-effects-of-the-economy-on-the-recent-slowdown-in-health-spending-2/), but here's what I believe to be the relevant section:

&gt;Our analysis suggests that the vast majority (77%) of the recent decline in the health spending trend can be attributed to broader changes in the economy. At the same time, however, there are also indications that structural changes in the health system may be playing a modest role as well. “Excess” health growth in recent years has fallen to levels similar to the mid to late 1990s when managed care was spreading rapidly. This could be due to continuing changes in the way health care is delivered, but also to rising levels of patient cost-sharing in private insurance plans that discourage use of services. While discussions in the health community have focused more on changes in delivery, it is difficult to determine which of these developments is having a greater impact.

&gt;As the economy recovers, health spending is likely to trend upwards, though growth rates are unlikely to return to the double-digit levels we have seen in the past. Future health spending increases will also depend on whether “excess” health costs remain at the relatively modest level of recent years or return to the historical norm. History suggests that previous efforts to control health care costs have had only a temporary effect, and there are initial signs that the recent slowdown (independent of the effects of the economy) is beginning to wane.

&gt;Changes coming under the ACA could also affect these trends significantly. Increases in coverage will induce a modest, one-time bump of a couple percent in spending as people who were previously uninsured get insurance and better access to health services. This will likely coincide with an expected economic recovery, so higher growth rates in health spending due to that recovery should not be attributed to the ACA simply because of the coincidental timing.

&gt;On the other side of the ledger, the bulk of the Medicare savings included in the ACA – primarily achieved through smaller increases in payments to providers – have yet to be realized and will lower the future growth in spending in that program. Changes in the delivery system – through accountable care organizations (ACOs) and bundled payments to providers – may also yield results and help to keep “excess” health costs down in public programs, as well as in private insurance. In addition, the ACA’s tax on high cost, “Cadillac” employer-sponsored health plans, scheduled to take effect in 2018, is expected to trim the cost of benefits and could lead to lower overall health spending as well.",2015-06-25 17:30:04+00:00,csifzpw,12.0,t1_csifg2e,802,politics

&gt; A struggle for the right of self-government ensued, which resulted, on the 4th of July, 1776, in a Declaration, by the Colonies, “that they are, and of right ought to be, **FREE AND INDEPENDENT STATES**; and that, as **free and independent States**, they have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and things which **independent States** may of right do.”

&gt;For purposes of defense, they united their arms and their counsels; and, in 1778, they entered into a League known as the Articles of Confederation, whereby they agreed to entrust the administration of their external relations to a common agent, known as the Congress of the United States, expressly declaring in the first article, “that **each State retains its sovereignty, freedom and independence, and every power, jurisdiction and right which is not, by this Confederation, expressly delegated to the United States in Congress assembled.**”

&gt;“Article 1.– His Britannic Majesty acknowledges the said United States, viz: New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia, to be **FREE, SOVEREIGN AND INDEPENDENT STATES**; that he treats with them as such; and for himself, his heirs and successors, relinquishes all claims to the government, propriety and territorial rights of the same and every part thereof.” 

&gt;Thus were established the two great principles asserted by the Colonies, namely: **the right of a State to govern itself**; and the right of a people to abolish a Government when it becomes destructive of the ends for which it was instituted.

&gt;And concurrent with the establishment of these principles, was the fact, that each Colony became and was recognized by the mother Country as a **FREE, SOVEREIGN AND INDEPENDENT STATE**.

I stopped looking for references to state's rights about a third of the way thru. 

Don't get me wrong: People (slave holders, actually) in South Carolina at the time this Declaration was issued may have believed they were fighting for State's rights as regards federal oversight, but anyone with half a brain knows States have no rights; individuals do. The Confederacy was fighting *against* individual rights, namely the individuals they kept in slavery.

* A Home Loan Bank to provide government help to the construction sector

* Congressional legalization of Hoover’s executive order that had blocked immigration

* Direct loans to state governments for spending on relief for the unemployed

* More aid to Federal Land Banks

* Creating a Public Works Administration that would both better coordinate Federal public works and expand them

* More vigorous enforcement of antitrust laws to end “destructive competition” in a variety of industries, as well as supporting work-sharing programs that would supposedly reduce unemployment

It might be accurate to say Hoover didn't push for all the progressive government interventions leftists would have liked, but to say he was ""hands off"" isn't accurate.

1160,"&gt;""Freer markets cause freer people"" is a fallacy so absurd, that it must be a deliberate misstatement by people with ulterior motives. Getting rich is a typical one.

Bullshit. There is a reason [economic freedom is positively correlated to wealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_of_Economic_Freedom).

The title of this post is misleading as well. There is a difference between the idea that a rising tide lifts all boats and ""trickle-down"" economics. Income disparity doesn't change the fact that the poorest Americans (and Europeans) enjoy far, far greater wealth than the poor in truly poor nations.",2015-06-16 15:06:05+00:00,cs8ennt,4.0,t1_cs89fw5,11051,worldnews
