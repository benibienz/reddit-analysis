It was about a boy in some sort of broken home and in his basement he finds this passage to another dimension run by bug creatures who worship a black hole (which turns out to be a wormhole) and there's this pendulum thing that the bugs are using to try and get this device that either speeds up or slows down your time-stream. The boy has some reason to enter the black hole and travels to another dimension where he finds this girl who is his mother (sister, aunt?) and tries to bring her back with him or something. I remember there being a sequel that wasn't as good about his niece and her discovering the world and only seeing a gargoyle on her house for a couple months at a time before it disappears. She finds out it's her uncle slowing down his timestream to stay young.",whatsthatbook,A sci-fi fantasy book I read,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthatbook/comments/5433ge/a_scifi_fantasy_book_i_read/

Arr. By Kyle E.
A long seven years ago
I can still remember how the game used to be mild
And I knew if I had my med
That I could make those people bled
And send them back to spawn, for a while
 
But 2016 made me shiver
Meet your Match, please deliver
Bad news on the server net
I couldn’t even R.P.S
 
I can’t remember if I cried
When I read about pubs demise
Suddenly I didn’t want to try
The day, TF2 died

(Chorus)
So bye, bye shitty pistoling spies
Went to community severs but all I found was hentai
And them hoovie boys were eating sandvich with rye
Singing this’ll be the day TF2 dies
This’ll be the day TF2 dies

(Verse 1)
Did you nerf the heavies glove?
And do you have faith in Gabe above
If the source code tells you so?
Do you believe in payload rolls?
Can tryhards ever gain a soul?
And can you teach me how to bind real slow?
 
Well I know that you’re a hacking Jim
Cause I saw that aimbot focus him
Red kicked that hacker, saved the Blu’s
Mann, I dig your, pink scout shoes
 

I was a lonely pubber, with crocket luck
With 2 Hale’s own stranges
Worth less than, 50 bucks
But I knew I was out of luck
The day, TF2 died

(Chorus)
I started singing, bye, bye shitty pistoling spies
Went to community severs but all I found was hentai
And them hoovie boys were eating sandvich with rye
Singing this’ll be the day TF2 dies
This’ll be the day TF2 dies

(Verse 2)
Now almost 9 years, we’ve been on our own
And Valve is still as quiet as a stone
But that’s not how it used to be
When devs still had passion for the Team
In a code more confusing than a flea
And a voice chat full of, pre-teens
 
And End of the Line had knocked us down
Valve threw at us, powerhouse
In hopes that we would return
To the games where phlogs would burn
 
And noobs looked up how to hit your mark
The try-hards hit out of the park
And we had spycrabs on the march
The day, TF2 died

(Chorus)
We were singing, bye, bye shitty pistoling spies
Went to community severs but all I found was hentai
And them hoovie boys were eating sandvich with rye
Singing this’ll be the day TF2 dies
This’ll be the day TF2 dies


(Verse 3)
Scout stole Sasha then he went and felt her
Mutated bread came out with burstchester
Eight minutes left, Engie’s building on last
Medic healed me out of my cast
Then hoovies tried for a sandvich pass
With the trolldier in mid air, falling fast
 
Now halftime came Red switched to Blue
And I had a score of, 32
We all gave our crits a chance
But with Kritzkreig, soldiers found romance
 
‘Casue the quick fix had too good of heals
When the time runs out the taunt kills wont yield
Did you play on the map cp_steel
The day, TF2 died?

(Chorus)
I started singing bye, bye shitty pistoling spies
Went to community severs but all I found was hentai
And them hoovie boys were eating sandvich with rye
Singing this’ll be the day TF2 dies
This’ll be the day TF2 dies

(Verse 4)
Oh and then were all in one place
A half an hour in the queue wait
Only to find a game a of hackers den
So come on, Scout be nimble, Scout be quick
Pyro’s flames ignited candlesticks
‘Cause 2 buttons are a noobs only friend
 
Oh, and I couldn’t even choose my stage
Getting put in cp_Yukon made me rage
No squeakers scream and yell
Could stop Machina hell
 

And as the flame wars raged all day and night
Reddit’s hot page was alight
LMAObox laughed in delight
The day, TF2 died
 
(Chorus)
They were singing bye, bye shitty pistoling spies
Went to community severs but all I found was hentai
And them hoovie boys were eating sandvich with rye
Singing this’ll be the day TF2 dies
This’ll be the day TF2 dies

(Outro)
I met Miss Moth and Muselk too
And I asked them for some update news
But they just frowned and walked away
I went down to Uncle’s door
Where he’d engie fragged for years before
But he said with this update, more could play
 
And in the idle’s the farmers screamed
Heavy mains cried and pyro’s dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The phlog was already broken
 
And the two men I admire most
Krunchy, Array, they couldn’t cope
They let out one last plea before losing hope
The day, TF2 died
 
(Chorus)
And they were singing bye, bye shitty pistoling spies
Went to community severs but all I found was hentai
And them hoovie boys were eating sandvich with rye
Singing this’ll be the day TF2 dies
This’ll be the day TF2 dies
 
They were singing bye, bye shitty pistoling spies
Went to community severs but all I found was hentai
And them hoovie boys were eating sandvich with rye
Singing this’ll be the day TF2 dies
This’ll be the day TF2 dies
