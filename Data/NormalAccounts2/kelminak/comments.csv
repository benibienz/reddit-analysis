If he:

* makes you extremely happy
* makes you miss him when he's gone
* makes you want to build a future together
* makes you not want anyone else

then you're probably in love.

I'd say personally, it took about a year of being with my girlfriend to truly feel ""in love"".

I mean, maybe your boyfriend has a point? You'd be surprised how much the people you surround yourself with influences your life. I remember when I was in high school, I had friends that fucked around like yours. When I stopped hanging out with them, my grades started improving and my life generally got better even if it felt like I wasn't doing anything differently.

You should aspire to hang out with people who are good influences and push you to be the best person you can be. Hanging around these people will only encourage you to fuck around and be like them. It's not any guarantee that you'll end up like them in any regard, but why have that type of temptation around rather than friends who work hard and push you to be like them instead?

It sounds like your boyfriend has good intuitions and it's a gut feeling that he's not able to shake about them. Those gut feelings are usually there to protect you, and he likely wants to protect you as well. I don't think his intentions are bad. It's also OK to make new groups of friends. This will happen frequently as you grow up and your old friends shouldn't shame you because you've moved on from their bullshit.

Tell him that he's threatening your marriage and ask him what's more important to him. I really don't like ultimatums, but in this instance that seems like all you have left. If he says you are more important, make sure he *follows through* and stops smoking. You know how difficult that can be so if he slips up, don't just bash him into the ground.

20,"You should absolutely not forgive him for this. You are super early and lucky to find out early what kind of person he is. Are you going to just put up with this shit just because ""he's stressed""? People get stressed out all of the time. That doesn't mean they neglect the people they care about or end their relationships. It's not your burden to fix this person.

&gt;For me relationships aren't disposable.

Grow up. You were together for **3 months**. That's almost nothing. Do the math: You used (3/324)*100=0.93% of your life finding out this guy isn't a good person and has serious issues you shouldn't put up with. I don't like the term ""wasted"" because I think you can learn a lot from a failed relationship, so don't think of this way. Recognize that his behaviors are not acceptable and in future relationships, make sure they don't have these same warning signs.

&gt;Is this really impossible?

It depends. Do you like being thrown to the wind any time things get tough? Tossed aside just because he's dealing with a difficult case and decided he can't handle a relationship at the same time? If those things sound great to you, you'd be a perfect match.

&gt;Can you trust someone after this?

How are you supposed to? I actually don't have an answer to this question. If I got broken up with in a short-term relationship because he was having a tough time with something, I'd be out of there in no time because I have self-respect and realize I deserve better.

A relationship is more than just being boyfriend and girlfriend. You're supposed to be teammates and rely on each other. A better boyfriend would want *more* of you in his life when he's stressed out to help him with the burdens rather than push you away and shoulder it even more.

22,"There's a few problems I see with your comp:

* Abathur has no one to hat/clone.
* You don't have much of a frontline.
* Your damage is very inconsistent. It relies on Chromie landing everything to be successful, which I'm doubting happened.
* By picking Zagara, you have only one assassin and therefore very low team damage.

I would have personally chosen a melee assassin that would not only have boosted your frontline, but also given Abathur a better hat/clone target. Also, ETC relies on people following up on his stuns. Nobody in your team can blow someone up if they get caught in a stun (Chromie can't cast fast enough and can't be expected to have things off-cooldown at that moment). Thrall/Sonya/Alarak would be ideal in this situation as all of them have burst, can follow up on ETC, and make formidable clone targets. I'd hesitate on Alarak since BHB is a PvE map and he doesn't clear camps well, but if you're better on him than on the other two, it'd be an OK backup.

To be clear, you could have won with your comp. You would have needed to avoid fights and instead focused on collecting coins/shoving lanes nonstop. Turn in enough times to get a level lead, then fight when they can't keep up with your talent leads (or straight up ignore them and just focus coins until you win).",2016-11-18 02:06:02+00:00,da53ojr,4.0,t1_da4xu9q,8371.0,heroesofthestorm

43,"&gt;I consider myself a high Platinum/low Diamond player.

What does that mean? You haven't made it to that point, so you aren't.

People in Diamond still get put with people in their placements and they work through it. It doesn't stop at any point. You need to keep playing, get better, and you'll eventually get to Diamond/Masters. Everyone has losing streaks. You're thinking in too small of a time span. Real change in rank/MMR comes from *hundreds* of games played. Think about it: If you have a 55% win rate over 200 ranked games, you'd be at a net 10 wins over losses. That's just two divisions! If you're at where the system thinks you belong and you're steadily climbing, just keep doing what you're doing.

&gt;Climbing from Silver 2 to Platinum 3 should show my game knowledge and skill.

All that shows is that you belong in Platinum 3. When I bombed my placement matches this season and I got put into Platinum 5, it was so easy that I was back to Diamond in literally 2 days. I couldn't stop winning because it was so below my skill level. If you really belonged up there right now, you'd be there.

You should definitely never stop playing. Not only does inaction net no reward, but you'd be an even worse player next season and most definitely go back go Gold. You just need to keep your chin up.",2016-11-10 21:55:26+00:00,d9uybzj,1.0,t3_5caey0,2335.0,heroesofthestorm

Do you actually want to do something with art as a career? I'm really good with computers, but I'm not doing it as a career and maintain it as a hobby. You can easily ruin your hobby by trying to make money out of it.

&gt;I got great grades in high school, and on my ACT

So you're at least decently intelligent

&gt;I have no drive, no study habits, and nothing interests me.

At some point, you have to take responsibility for yourself and fix this. I know from experience after wasting years of college classes doing poorly, so don't make my mistake. It's easier to fix this early on than later when you've crashed your GPA. 

&gt;nothing interests me

&gt;I know it would make my family proud if I could bring myself to be an engineer or a doctor.

**ABSOLUTELY DON'T CHOOSE A MAJOR BASED ON WHAT YOUR FAMILY WANTS.**

You want to know the fast track to burning out in college and wasting years of your life? Choose something that your family wants instead of you. I *highly doubt* that nothing interests you, but you're not giving yourself enough credit that you could be successful if you put the work in. You did it in high school and nothing has changed since then. An overwhelming majority of majors in college don't require you to be naturally intelligent. You just have to be able to sit down and put the work in that they ask of you. Some majors like math and physics are very problem/homework intensive in that you'll have to sit down and practice tons of problems to do well. Other majors like biology are very concept and information heavy which require you to brute-force a bunch of information using a ton of notecards. In *both* cases, no innate knowledge is required but instead the drive to do the work necessary.

You need to figure out what you *want* out of a career, then start looking for careers that can meet that requirement. Is making six figures important to you? There are tons of ways to get there, but some of them require a tremendous amount of work relative to others. Do you want a cushy job that pays 50-70k and doesn't require lots of work? There are definitely majors that will open up that path to you to.

155,"So I have a degree in biology and to be honest, I would stay away from our field unless you specifically had a higher-level career in mind. There are virtually no good jobs unless you move up higher and even then it's hyper-competitive.

I also work in IT for my university currently while I work toward med school (long story) and there are a few CS majors with us there. From what I've gathered from them, your degree is HARD, but every single person who has graduated with a CS degree has **immediately** picked up a ridiculously lucrative job out of college.

I think there comes a point in every college career where you take a class that just completely feels like shit and makes you question everything.  For me, it was ecology. Holy shit that class was so boring and I couldn't give the slightest fuck about it. However, realize that a lot of the fun and interesting classes are almost always restricted to the juniors/seniors and I would be willing to bet if you stuck with it, you'll get into those cool classes and wonder what you were worrying about. After I trudged through ecology, I got to take things like pharmacology, molecular neurobiology, etc. that were *suuuuuper* cool.  Your degree probably has similar things.

&gt;I also don't want to be sitting in front of a computer all day writing code when I finally do get a job.

This is the part that concerns me. You will definitely be doing this for your job. What is it about that that bothers you? Do you think you're missing out on a grand adventure in some other field? What are you looking for that is supposed to be the alternative to that? I think a lot of people look down on this, but I don't really understand why having a safe, comfortable job would be a downside and if anything should be a tremendous benefit. I'm not trying to convince you of anything here, I just want to know more on what your thoughts are here.

&gt;It's not realistic to just expect that I'll be like David Attenborough when I graduate.

Or ever to be honest. He's an anomaly, not the majority.

I think computer science is a great and respectable field, but you have to be the one to put your nose to the grindstone and do the work to get there. If you find that you truly can't, also realize that **all** majors will require you to put in some hard work at some point to make it through and each major has some sort of weeder class. ^^^^fuck ^^^^organic ^^^^chemistry

One thing to also think about is that you have to differentiate what you want to do as your career versus what you want to do as your hobby. Even as a computer scientist, what is to stop you from going and picking out books related to the topics you're interested in and studying them for yourself? Or if you're *really* interested in biology-related stuff, why don't you do a minor in biology to get some of the groundwork information for yourself, then go from there? Don't quote me on this, but I'm pretty sure computational biology is a field? I know very little about this area so you'd have to do more research into it.

It's clear you're just referring to the income, which is absolutely important, but there's a reason people become elementary school teachers despite the return on investment being terrible. You want to go to college with a career in mind, not a major. So she needs to think about what career sounds the best and then trace backwards what steps need to be taken to get there. You can get a job with virtually any major, but there are some that you can get a job straight out of college while others *cough*mystupidbiologyfield* you can barely get a basic lab tech job without moving on to a Masters, etc.

I want you to stay the hell away from TLV. Nobody at your league can accommodate them no matter what they say. They simply do not have the skill or knowledge of how they work and what team comps work with them.

Learn how to take mercenaries at the right time. Simply taking them at your league is probably better than nothing, but if you can time them to be just before an objective and let them push, that is something a majority of people at your level of play won't do.

You do better in TL because you're being carried by better players. I don't mean that in any offense, but if you play with good people, you do better. It makes sense, right?

A safe team comp in a majority of instances for HL has the following:

* **Main tank**
* Off-tank or other melee
* **Burst damage**
* Sustain damage
* **Healer**

You can make adjustments to the unbolded, but if you want an at-a-glance comp, that's pretty safe for HL.

Try to learn map-specific picks and strategies where you can. [McIntyre](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy2pSbktCNa0P9cR0wfLtwg) has started making map-specific videos that I want you to watch. There are certain timings that I'm certain you don't know yet that you can use to your advantage. These videos are *long* and extensive, but you can crank it up to 1.5x speed on YouTube and absorb as much as possible. Half the battle of being good at this game is knowing as much as possible before the game even starts.

I'm coming to the end of a month-long silence now. I've been silenced in LoL and now HotS many times. I am *not* the kind of person to tell someone to kill themselves, etc. That kind of stuff is ridiculously excessive. That said, the ""report abuse"" button doesn't differentiate that. The things that I have said include things such as ""I don't think the way you are playing is acceptable for the ranking we're at."" ""It's not acceptable for you to die so much in Diamond"" etc.

277,"You don't need to dedicate all of your time to pull an A average. 97% is oddly specific.

Short-list on being an A-student:

* Show up to class. NEVER skip.
* Actually pay attention and take notes.
* Do the homework and do it *early* so if something goes wrong or you don't understand, you can ask questions or make arrangements.
* Study more than a day in advance for tests. You MUST SLEEP on the information you've learned to make it permanent in your brain. Last minute studying won't get you far. At least two days of prep (for what I'm assuming is high school) should be enough for a test at your level.
* Ask questions when you don't understand something and don't be afraid to go to the teacher after class for help. Teachers generally *want* you to learn the information, so if there's something you can't seem to get the hang of, go to after-hours and have them work through it with you.

I guarantee if you do these things, your grades will skyrocket. Take your lunches. You need to recharge and be a human. Nobody is a robotic school machine. Put forth the effort to be better than your peers and you will be. That doesn't mean sacrificing everything to get there.

Side note: Think about the environment you put yourself in and whether or not it's conductive to being a good student. Do you hang out with friends that fuck around in class the whole time and never pay attention? You need to be willing to part with them at least while you're in class so you set yourself up for success because these people will drag you down.

281,"Calorie counting is extremely well-documented as being an effective means of losing weight. Quite frankly, it's just basic physics where if you expend more energy than you take in, you will burn fat to make up the difference.

""Starvation mode"" is not a real thing and is typically touted by ""Healthy At Every Size"" people as their excuse for why they can't lose weight instead of their lack of discipline.

I do know what you're referring to regarding the Biggest Loser ""study"" (more like just a follow-up) and here's what you need to consider: Before the show, these people were morbidly obese. They went through extremely rigorous training for a very long time to drop weight at a rate that normally isn't deemed weight. They were supervised by medical professionals and it was all very carefully done. 

Now with that in mind, imagine going through all of that nonstop training and someone finally told them they didn't have to do it anymore. What would you do if you had been through that? Well I'd probably continue exercising, maybe after a break? However, these people who were training so hard could actually eat tremendous amounts of food without actually gaining weight because they were working so hard all of the time. Now that they aren't training like olympic athletes, they need to adjust their eating habits to compensate. If they *don't* which is *very likely*, they are going to end up eating far too much food compared to their energy expenditure and put on weight again. That kind of dramatic shift in eating habits isn't an easy undertaking.

There is a lot to that article that was very bro-science and pretty poorly thought through. It's almost as if the writer had an *agenda* to prove that counting your calories doesn't work. If it didn't, why can you go to /r/loseit, /r/fitness, and other fitness-related subreddits and find that counting calories works for all of them? *Every person* who has shared a success story there has followed one of two diet plans:

* Counting calories. They calculate what amount of calories they need to eat and keep themselves at or below that number.
* [Intuitive eating](https://www.intuitiveeating.com/content/10-principles-intuitive-eating). They might not have *known* it was called that, but they followed these basic principles.

To look at extreme cases and think you're going to be able to make generalizations for everyone is a bit of a stretch. You might suffer from some of the issues they did if you underwent the same path, but if you're an average person looking to lose weight at a reasonable pace, you'll find calorie counting to be the best path.

If something was going to happen between you (and I mean something serious and long-term), it would have happened by now. You have all of this weird friend-relationship drama because you never clearly defined what you wanted out of the relationship and now you'll never get it.

Here's what you do going forward when you meet someone you are interested in: Set up dates with the clear intention that you are interested in them then proceed into a relationship if you two seem compatible. This friend-to-relationship stuff that men desperately want to believe happens is an exception, not the rule.

* Cut contact from this person who is effectively a sunk cost.
* Focus on improving yourself: Work on fitness, social skills, and career.
* When interested in someone romantically, be clear and set up a date.

If your team will let you play an assassin, do so. If your team needs a tank and no more assassins, pick tank to not screw over your team.

They're idiots. Sonya isn't a tank. She is a frontline bruiser and pairs really well with a main tank. If they don't understand that, you can't help them. Just mute and move on.

&gt;No, my average play is 3-4 games each work-day and 5-10 games on weekend days. However, totally agree about practice -- just don't always have enough time for practice.

A main tank and a bruiser like Sonya/Anub gives a sturdy team without gimping your team of too much damage. Additionally a main tank and a melee assassin like Thrall/Kerrigan can work as well. If you don't have enough frontline, you can get nuked too easily. If you have too much frontline, your team runs into itself and isn't effective.
* You don't play enough period. You need to get raw experience to be better at the game. You play maybe a game a day at most? If you want faster progress, you need to just play more.

426,"&gt;Never ban a low-priority hero that your allies have preselected. People play best on their comfort picks. Make a team out of it and have fun. If he goes for gazlowe, ask if someone can get zeratul to set up a combo.

Ranked is for taking the game seriously. If you are honestly going to sit here and defend someone picking Gazlowe in ranked, I'm going to be baffled in how to respond. I didn't do it to tilt all of them, I did it to protect them and myself from the awful decision they were trying to make. It was my last game before I was going to be in a demotion series. I'm not ""easily tilted"" because I made one decision that my team didn't like. They spent the entirety of the game berating me. A full 20 minutes calling me an awful player, but *I* am the one who is easily tilted? I didn't insult my team a single time in either champ select or the game.

[Also,  Gazlowe isn't a ""comfort pick"" at level 7.](http://www.hotslogs.com/Player/Profile?PlayerID=6996470)

Why am *I* the bad guy when they are the ones that went apeshit and intentionally lost the game in spite of me?

Don't insult me as a team leader. I work relentlessly hard to try to be positive, but do you really think you've addressed anything I discussed?

You used to be immediately socially outcast for liking nerdy things, but since it's become ""popular"" to become nerdy, it's easier to enjoy nerdy stuff and there's more nerdy stuff to enjoy. Quite frankly, it's weird that he's so offended that his ""culture"" is being ""appropriated"". Yes, IFLS is a cancerous webpage, but what different does it really make?  Sure sites like ""geeksaresexy"" are bound to appear, but as a whole I think society appreciates ""nerdy"" things a lot more than in the past.

Then there's this freakshow rant:

&gt;The model above looks like she has the choice to have lots of sex. She's probably not a nerd. Not fair? Well neither is being born attractive. Let the nerds have something. Not everyone was born with good looks or enough power &amp; wealth to compensate. If you have to tell people you're a nerd, chances are you're not. Nerds don't have to advertise their status. We know. Being a nerd is a byproduct of losing yourself in what you do, often at the expense of friends, family and hygiene. Until or unless you've paid your dues, you haven't earned the right—or reason—to call yourself a nerd. Being a nerd isn't graceful or glorious. It's a life born out of obsessive dedication to a craft, discipline or collecting some stupid shit that only you care about.

What is his obsession about nerds not having sex? Just because you're a nerd doesn't mean you're automatically a socially retarded virgin. To emphasize:

&gt;**Being a nerd is a byproduct of losing yourself in what you do, often at the expense of friends, family and hygiene.**

Seriously? Why?? I'm an absolute nerd in almost any sense, but I'm also interested in fitness, have good hygiene, and have reasonably decent social skills. Maybe n=1, but I highly doubt I'm the only nerd out there that doesn't belong on /r/justneckbeardthings.

&gt;If you think geeks are so sexy or cool, bang one. Go to any university and find a computer or physics lab at 2AM and take your pick. Until then, go commit cultural fraud someplace else, and take your phony ""I fucking love science"" group with you.

548,"Honestly, I have a hard time recommending the game to anyone. It's an absolutely great multiplayer game, but I wouldn't hope to amount to remotely anything in the game without a massive amount of practice hours. It took me a year to go from Bronze to Diamond in SC2 in WoL and compared to the people who play at the upper brackets, I would be absolute garbage. It's probably one of the most stressful competitive games I've played either. I would work so hard for a win that I would have red splotches on my face from focusing so intensely. If you're good at chilling out and not caring too much, then you can dink around in the lower brackets and have a great time. Also, 4v4s in Starcraft 2 are a hilarious blast and much, much easier (I got to Master in 3s and 4s doing silly strats to have fun).

EDIT: Please stop commenting that you don't have to be at the top levels of multiplayer to enjoy the game. I already explicitly said there are other ways to enjoy the game. However, multiplayer is extremely stressful both mentally and physically, so I don't think it's a great game to get into unless you are an absolutely hardcore player.

696,"&gt;The thing is, I don't know if I believe her reasons.

Unfortunately, she doesn't have to have any reason to change her mind. She can decide she doesn't feel the way she did the day before and isn't obligated to explain to you why. You guys weren't even dating, so she especially doesn't have to explain anything.

&gt;I feel like I need closure to finally move on from all these relationships I've left disappointed.

You're going to hear this a lot here: Closure is a myth and doesn't exist. You simply need to learn how to move on when you're rejected. You're only 18, so get ready to be rejected a bunch. It's totally not a bad thing.

&gt;Did she lie because of her fears? Or was everything true and I'm not seeing it?

Nobody knows but her, but quite frankly it doesn't matter. She's giving you a clear no and you need to respect it.

The fortunate thing is that you're going to be heading to college soon and there are going to be plenty of women for you to both be accepted and rejected by. Here are some notes you can take:

* Don't take rejection personally. People don't have to like you, and you don't have to like them. People can also change their minds.
* Learn to not over-analyze things and go with the flow. If things are going well, just do whatever's working and if it stops working, see if there's an obvious answer why or move on if there isn't (this case).
* In your case, it may not hurt to confide in a counselor and get yourself on a path to success mentally. I don't want you to get bogged down by this stuff too badly when in the long run I promise it's not going to matter. I'm sure you'll find someone who is equally into you and you won't have to do any guess-and-check nonsense.

742,"&gt; Or does life just have ugly phases we have to get over.

You, alone, have to make that decision for yourself and your experience doesn't dictate what other people are going through. There are people who have no external reasons to be depressed, yet still are lucky to get out of bed each day because of how badly they are affected by it. Therapy + SSRIs are the most effective combination, but an SSRI alone is a good start for someone who needs immediate help. Therapy helps sort out personal problems that can lead to depression, but that doesn't necessarily mean when a person's life is improved, they'll want to get off of the drug.

&gt;But what would our ancient ancestors have done?

Died of polio or be committed to a mental institution. History isn't a great basis for medical treatments.

&gt;Why is every mass shooting caused by someone on anti-depressants?

Extremely niche population where there are many more factors involved. SSRIs are not a cure-all, but can be extremely effective in people with moderate to severe depression.

753,"I don't agree that you should just jump ship on school. The intro classes are BOOOORING, but once you get into the more in-depth stuff, that's where the real deep, meaningful content is. I have a degree in biology and the first couple years were an absolute drag, but they were completely necessary to give me the building blocks I needed to understand the more complicated topics of biology.

So you hate math? Fine, pick a different major that requires less math. Most of the majors that make you easy to be employable or move onto a professional school are going to involve some math, but not necessarily anything beyond calculus I/II. I think science is absolutely amazing, so you could try out a bio class, chemistry class, and physics class and see what clicks best with you if you want to go down that road. I don't know how to dabble in non-science courses, so someone else would have to guide you on that.

Here's the short list of things you need to **immediately** do:

1) Look up counselors that your school provides and book a session. You are going to end up wasting years of your time destroying your GPA if you don't get on track. I know because *I was at your point and never got help to fix it.* Now I'm climbing from a 1.8 GPA to a 3.0 and it's absolutely miserable. Get the help you need now before you've dug yourself into a hole. Retaking a class or two that you bombed isn't too bad. Retaking a few years like me? Just don't let it get to that point.

2) Find a guidance counselor that your school offers and talk with them about what you want in a career. You don't necessarily need to know *what* career, but more of the things that you want out of it. Good family balance? Lots of money? Do you want to be out in the field or behind a desk? Take some good time to think about those things and tell them about that. You can even post that stuff on this same subreddit and we could probably point out some good career suggestions.

3) Are your parents educated and are you on good terms with them? I don't think closing yourself off and not telling people that you are struggling is the best route and it helps to have family members that have been through college to talk to. I emphasize that they've been through college because if they haven't, they can't understand what you're going through and can't make meaningful suggestions.

I can tell from your post that you aren't going to be satisfied with a menial job like the one you have, so education is mandatory. Take the steps I've given you and seriously do all of them. You'll save time, save money, and be happier with your life. You won't work that shitty job forever, I promise.",2016-03-08 05:23:49+00:00,d0rqsbd,1.0,t3_49g66v,11439.0,findapath

755,"&gt;science classes are a joke (high GPA but not getting anything out of it)

Then abuse it for a high GPA to apply with. Nothing wrong with that. If you're still taking the intro courses, yeah they're pretty boring. I think the higher level bio classes are far more interesting (Human Phys, Pharm, Neuro, etc.).

Clinical volunteering isn't mandatory, but it's really, really good to have on an application. I'd keep bugging the hospitals in your area until they budge with *anything*. For other clinical experience, here's an SDN article [you can look at for ideas](http://www.studentdoctor.net/2014/07/5-paid-ways-to-get-clinical-experience/).

999,"What your friend thinks and what is reality is far different. You noted from another comment that you come from Smite. Smite isn't a top-down MOBA, so while you're familiar with a lot of the concepts, the mastery of mechanics isn't going to be there immediately. For what it's worth, my placements went *horribly* and I was placed into the 30s and had to claw my way up to Rank 1. I learned quite a bit along the way and it took ~200 games to get to Rank 1. The fact that you're not getting there overnight is probably a symptom of you being a human being who isn't perfect. I do think it's more annoying that you got placed too high instead of too low so it feels like you're plummeting instead of grinding upward. It *will* balance out though as you learn more about what works the best. Here are some quick things I noted that helped me get to Rank 1:

* It's not good enough to have good mechanics in this game. Quite frankly, the mechanics in this game are the easiest of any MOBA I've ever tried. There's no ""carrying"" just by playing by yourself. You **must be a leader.** Know the strategy you want to execute and communicate it to your team. If your strategies are good, they'll follow through your example.

* Expect to play a bunch. Sure people get to Rank 1 in a few games off of placements. Those people are usually really experienced with the game already and their MMR is extremely turbulent.

* Know your meta and who can counter what. There is absolutely no shame in abusing a tier list as a go-to if you're not sure who is strong at the moment. Chu8, a regular multi-top 200 player, [has a tier list I recommend.(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AnejYOtiN-aSvbRGrMPTYSWeCN3Pmfqm-CkCqbVrdpI/edit) I'm not saying to blindly pick these champions, but if you're unsure who to go with, you're probably not going to go wrong picking someone high on the list. He has a talent guide there as well if you're unsure on those.

* **ABSOLUTELY NO BICKERING/TRASH TALK/RUDE COMMENTS.** The second your team starts fighting itself, you are almost guaranteed to lose. Use the mute function, put out fires between teammates, and keep the most positive mindset you can (this is actually my biggest struggle).

Hopefully some of these help since I don't know everything that is going on in your games, but I can tell you that the fact that you care enough to get better is a great step in the right direction. Stick to it and I promise you'll get there. Rank 1 players are *not* legendary beings: they're just people who have put in a bit more time than others both in and out of the game. :)",2015-12-11 16:35:40+00:00,cxvge07,3.0,t1_cxvevrc,2331.0,heroesofthestorm

Bingo. Completely normal to romanticize someone else as if they're perfect, when in reality even if you did leave for them, you'd likely end up in a similar situation to where you're at now. You should invest more into your relationship and making it more exciting rather than waste time pining over someone else. Associating with her less will aid you in this. If you have a good girlfriend that you enjoy, there isn't a reason to throw it away when you can still improve your situation.

&gt;We live together although in my opinion we moved in together too fast(after 3 months) and this has caused lots of issues for me since I moved into her house which is right next door to help parents who are always around.

1107,"I have a degree in human biology, and it's definitely not that simple. It is really easy to extrapolate anecdotal evidence to a population at large. People aren't cavemen anymore, and while there may be influences in this regard, there are far more factors that go into what both men and women find attractive. Also, ""attractive"" versus ""long-term partner to raise child with"" is going to have very different requirements. What you are describing looks more to the latter, which is more complicated than what the chart (and this original discussion) hints to: by not being obese, you win by default in being attractive. In a study, it's highly unlikely that without telling them the background of the pictures shown, that women are going to choose the overweight, unhealthy male as more attractive than someone who is fit. That decision may be influenced if you were to describe the overweight man as a multi-billionaire compared to a poor, fit person, but I can't say for sure. 

I might have rambled a bit, but the overall point I'm trying to make is that attractiveness is a complicated subject and doesn't boil down to caveman instincts. :P",2015-11-14 22:27:23+00:00,cx0beg7,9.0,t1_cx07yry,6756.0,fatlogic

Crushes are pretty normal and oftentimes they arise from something lacking in your relationship.

We're working on incorporating this into our relationship more now and I'm totally over that crush.

I wouldn't bring the crush up right away, but I ended up telling my girlfriend about her and how I felt guilty about it, then explained that the reason I thought I felt this way was because she was very into fitness and how I wanted to incorporate that.

1327,"These are massive signs of depression. You need to sit down and have a long talk with her to get the bottom of what is going on. I have had a similar experience and the symptoms you have listed are literal symptoms of depression. She might have some reasons that can be worked with, but she's going to need to see a doctor and at minimum start antidepressants. They don't work overnight, but they do make a difference in the long-run.

&gt;I know she won't DO anything but I just worry??

Honestly you don't know shit. If you're this concerned about her, then obviously something is wrong and it's usually the person on the outside who needs to do something to help them realize there is a large issue. Sit down with her, force the issue, and say you won't budge until you get down to the bottom of this. Before you do, I want you to research depression: signs, symptoms, and treatment options. An antidepressant is a good start, but it isn't a fix-all and counseling along with it has the greatest effect. When you have this talk, you should already be knowledgeable so you can relay to her what you've seen is going on, how it falls in line with depression, and what you want to do help. Reinforce that you still love her, but something needs to change because it is affecting the both of you.

If she absolutely won't budge, then there's only so much you can put yourself through before you give up, but considering she seems to trust you and care about you, it's likely you can get something out of her. ",2015-09-09 00:57:38+00:00,cuv2wvz,1.0,t3_3k4qsm,19875.0,relationships
1328,"How long have you known this new girl at work? There are some girls that when I met them initially, they blew me away and I felt extremely guilty for how I felt toward them, but it wore off with some time when I considered everything as a whole. There's a difference between crushes that wear off and someone who you are absolutely convinced would be life-changing to be with. Here are some things to consider:

&gt;overall we've been happy
&gt;I can actually say that I'm not really happy anymore in my relationship

Which of these is true? Do you think you need to work more on getting a spark in your relationship? Are you just pining for the initial honeymoon phase that inevitably fades away in any relationship? Or are you tired of seeing that person all of the time and truly wish it was someone else? Your significant other will always eventually become your best friend as well, so it's normal to view them that way, but they need to be your romantic partner as well. Putting work into an existing relationship that has lasted this long is going to be a hell of a lot easier than throwing that work away and starting from scratch, but only *you* can decide if it's worth it or not. 

Consider never seeing your girlfriend again. Consider the break up, how you would feel being rid of her, and how your life would proceed from there. Do all of those things sound appealing to you? If this girl truly makes you want to get rid of her that badly, then maybe you found something, but if it's an initial crush, I'd hold off before throwing your established relationship away.",2015-09-09 00:49:42+00:00,cuv2mo2,1.0,t3_3k5c0o,10413.0,relationships

I am a rank 1 player who primarily aims at having a fun, educational stream where people can feel comfortable to ask questions and learn how to better their performance in ranked. I will be playing both quick match and hero league as I have an alternate account I am working on and occasionally need to complete quests with. Despite this, I will do my best to talk out my decisions, explain my thought process, and answer any questions I receive.

I have a degree in Biology (Human Emphasis), but have a low GPA that isn't competitive for medical school, so I will be retaking classes this year and apply this upcoming summer. That said, school will always take priority over streaming, but I will make a good effort to stream whenever I load up the game.

1381,"I like how casuals are supposedly this new thing that shows up and destroys established hardcore games, and the only way to overcome it is to fight back. Smash Bros. is designed as a casual game that the community around it decided to go in a hardcore route with it *if you want to play it like that*. There are new/bad players in any non-ranked game, and having the position that you have to defeat them gives the impression that you're inexperienced with multiplayer games as a whole.

&gt;Now the game's in its current state and you can't barely go a match without destroying a hatless F2P who has under 50 hours logged and doesn't know his ass from his elbow.

Are you implying the game requires you to be extremely good? The game is literally designed to be a casual hop-in game, and the fact that you've dumped so much time into it is your own fault for being so good. Why would you hold everyone to the standard of your own skill? I've dumped hundreds of hours into Heroes of the Storm, so why would I go into a non-ranked quick match and expect people to be at my level? That's effectively what you're saying with this post.

TL;DR You're better than your peers because you've dumped thousands of hours into a casual game and now you expect everyone else to be as good as you, and if they're not they're filthy casuals.",2015-08-31 13:25:38+00:00,culs4dd,1.0,t3_3j1lij,32769.0,StarWarsBattlefront

What I found when climbing to be more important than mechanical skill is to be a leader. You want your team to do a strat? Tell them that strat or they'll have no idea what to do. Make the calls for your team and you'll see more success than just being a good player individually.

Quite frankly, don't give a fuck about your rank. I know that's easier said than done, but just view HL as a way to play your best and try to improve. Remember the 40-40-20 rule: 40% of the games are lost from the second you joined the game due to circumstances you can't control. Likewise, you'll win 40% of your games no matter how you play because your enemies will just not be capable of winning. There's only 20% of games where you make a real difference in whether or not your team wins the game. After each game, ask yourself: Was this a 40% win? 40% loss? Or did my actions really have an influence on the game? If you feel like you did great and your teammates all died 10x more than you, yeah that's likely a 40% loss. If it's an absolute massacre and you win in 10 minutes, that's a 40% win.

(I ask everyone this) It took me 300+ games to get to rank 1 playing 100% solo, so if you're not nearing that mark, you might need to just keep playing more. It sounds like you know what the good champs are in the current meta. There are definitely some luck factors involves and win/loss streaks will come and go. I played Johanna close to where you did, but it felt like I hit a wall. One of the more important things that people overlook is picking the right tank and support for the map. Johanna is a great pick when they have lots of auto attackers that are going to get shut down, but if they're all spell damage, Muradin's raw tankiness from Avatar is going to be a stronger pick (etc. etc. etc.). Additionally, being flexible and not taking the same exact talents every game will help you improve as well. In terms of supports, Malf/Li Li are going to be stronger in teamfight maps like Cursed Hollow, but Uther/Rehgar dominate Sky Temple/Dragon Shire since their burst healing to secure shrines is more useful than AoE healing.

I'm kind of rambling, but I think you could get to rank 1 if you wanted to with tank/support. Keep in mind if nothing's changing in your rank and you aren't playing differently, you can't expect anything different to happen. Think about every decision and see if you can find anything you can improve.

1447,"&gt; Basically all I was saying is that you are right that having the top teir heroes makes a big difference when it come to gaining rank and really seems to be the only decider when matchmaking seems to come down to a coin flip. I've realized if I want to continue gaining rank I need to start making some more hero purchases, especially when those I have made in the past are no longer relevant due to meta changes or nerfs.

It's a good thing you've noticed this. Have you ever heard of the 40-40-20 rule? 40% of the games you will play, you have already lost before the match started. There is absolutely no chance you would have won no matter how well you played. On the flip side, there are 40% of matches that you will win without the slightest chance of you losing. The remaining 20% are the games that you truly have an influence on and those are the games that are going to make you climb. You're spot on by realizing that having all of the best champions will make the difference, and it's those 20% of games that you'll start to win consistently.

I am Rank 1 without buying a single master skin. I think that despite them being cool, they're an absolute waste of gold when the best champions are generally very expensive. I did buy the Nexus Bundle which I recommend to anyone who wants to climb since you get such a massive pool of heroes. Not keeping up with the meta can honestly tank your rating a full ten ranks like you have, but as an anecdote, I have fallen 4-5 ranks in a row and climbed back up. It's *shitty*, but losing streaks and winning streaks will come and go. A good player will recognize when they can't stop losing and know when to fold the cards rather than thinking grinding games is the solution.",2015-08-14 00:53:33+00:00,cu29d0k,6.0,t1_cu295zv,343.0,heroesofthestorm
1448,"I don't think people using an OP champion inherently makes someone good. I believe being good is a combination of mechanical skill, decision making, and game knowledge. If there are two people of equal skill, but one person picks the champion that is stronger in the meta, then that player is going to simply have an advantage. It doesn't make you a good player by intentionally restricting yourself to champions that are weaker. A top-tier player will give themselves every advantage possible and thinking that picking an OP champion makes someone weaker will only hold someone back. To me not doing that would be like saying, ""I know that Zeratul is strong, but I'd rather reduce my chances of winning by getting really strong at Stitches (rest in peaces)."" You *can*, but what purpose does it serve when you could be even higher ranked playing a better character in the meta?",2015-08-14 00:44:30+00:00,cu291yw,8.0,t1_cu27cjb,3046.0,heroesofthestorm
1449,"&gt;But most ranked is about improving yourself and having a good time in a semi competitive environment

I don't mean this offensively, but you are the kind of player that I do not enjoy having on my team. Ranked is the absolute best this game has to offer if you're a solo player who wants to push themselves to the best of their abilities without moving on to the next step of forming a team, etc. I have a good time by picking the absolute best champions, playing my absolute best, and winning due to maximizing my chance of success. The people that aren't pushing themselves like that are extremely frustrating since our opinions of how ranked should be played is different and I feel like I'm being held back when people don't go for the absolute best choice.. I do *get* where you're coming from with that midset, but when I see ranked, that word doesn't mean ""semi competitive"". Either you're trying your best to win (ranked), or you're fucking around having fun (quick match).

Again, I don't mean this as a personal attack in any way so don't take it that way. I understand your mindset, but it definitely grinds my gears having teammates like that when I'm trying so damn hard to do everything in my power in and out of the game to win.

&gt;I try to not play heroes that are considered stupidly OP because I wait for their nerfs to come out so that I can get used and become good at their balanced point. Often people get used to OP heroes and then just become shit at them when they're balanced (while hero is still strong... they just can't play that hero anymore).

I don't really think that it's hard to learn a new champion? The meta will flow endlessly, and I can adapt to whoever is the best at that time. It doesn't bother me in the slightest to hop OP bandwagons to give my team to the best chance of winning possible.

&gt;Yes, I would 100% practice OP heroes if I was playing competitive... but ranked is not serious enough to warrant that kind of cancerous behavior.

I guess what I don't understand is what do you think is supposed to be more serious than ranked play?",2015-08-13 23:46:26+00:00,cu273ht,6.0,t1_cu23qh7,5919.0,heroesofthestorm

This is a really worrisome thing if you're considering medicine. Yes, there are a couple of specialties where you will rarely talk to patients, but they are also very competitive and going into medicine thinking that you're a shoe-in for those is pretty risky when you could end up doing family medicine for the rest of your life (nothing wrong with the profession, but it doesn't sound like it suits what you're looking for).

Absolutely EVERY physician says do not go into medicine for the money. You will be in a crippling amount of debt for an extremely long amount of time before you start to feel like you're making a good amount of money. There are ways you can cut down on this cost, but for the most part, you won't be seeing a big paycheck until after 4 years of medical school and 3-5 years of residency, after which you need to pay back hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt. Being a physician is considered a *public service job* for a reason. There are countless easier ways to just make money if that is one of your primary motivators.

Quite frankly, if you are determined to get into medical school, you had better sit your ass down and do some serious research about what it takes to get in and what you're getting into for the entire duration of school, residency, and being an attending.",2015-08-11 00:14:33+00:00,ctyl65e,1.0,t3_3giuwx,3963.0,findapath

1553,"&gt;with financial incentives) to prescribe medication over natural approaches.

Unfortunately, for a majority of mental illnesses, natural approaches aren't effective on their own. My highest experience comes with depression from both people I've worked with and through my education, and natural approaches such as therapy (I assume this is what you mean) are effective, along with medication being effective, but combined they have the highest success rate (both &gt; medicine alone &gt; therapy alone).

I agree that preventative medicine and healthy living are important, and when I am a physician this is going to be one of my biggest beliefs when helping my patients. Despite this, I'm not going to deny them a medication that I know will help them get started in the right direction because I want them to take natural approaches first. There are a lot of patients with depression who simply won't go to counseling of any sort, but a simple SSRI can make a large impact in their daily life.

In terms of other mental illnesses, most are extremely easy to diagnose and the medications we have available are quite effective. ADHD is the one that people get worked up over because they think that it's just given to any overactive kid, and while that might happen in some cases, oftentimes these kids are highly destructive due to their behaviors and it can bring them back to being able to function in their classes, with friends, etc. again.

The vitamin issue isn't related, but I will agree that vitamins are extremely overused and I believe I read some research recently that showed that anything beyond a simple multivitamin was unnecessary (unless you're some sort of bodybuilder that could truly make use of additional supplements).

&gt;People in America are over-diagnosed and over-prescribed, a phenomenon brought on partially by making healthcare for-profit and under-regulated.

I don't really feel like this is the case, or at least to the catastrophic level you're making it out to be. Most physicians are trained to help their patients find the cheapest, yet most effective, form of treatment. This includes trying generic drugs before attempting to use brand-name ones, making lifestyle modifications, and other options to reduce cost. This may *not* be true in the case of private practice physicians who have more free reign and could be more prone to influence from pharmaceutical companies, but this is the risk you take going to a private practice, and hopefully the people that do so have done the appropriate research about them before going.

1649,"Going to the doctor and finding out nothing is wrong is the BEST thing you can hear, and that's what the doctor is going to want to tell you too. You're much better off going, having them tell you that, and getting your peace of mind than to ignore it, find out it's a big problem that you've now let snowball, and it's harder to deal with. There is absolutely nothing wrong with seeing your family doctor and getting their opinion on something. They might instantly know what the problem is or know it's not a problem within the 15 minute time frame they try to keep you in, then you can both go about your lives.

You are not a burden to your family doctor and their job is to keep you healthy. If there is something that is legitimately concerning you, you should go see them. At minimum, you can just call the office and ask if you could relay what your problem is to the nurse/doctor and ask if they would recommend you come in to be seen. They should be willing to do that for you and give you a call back when they can to let you know if you should go in.",2015-06-19 16:26:08+00:00,csbzlet,1.0,t3_3adgdj,38986.0,AskDoctorSmeeee
