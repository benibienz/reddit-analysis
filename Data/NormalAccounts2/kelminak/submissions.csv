If there's one thing they should be able to draw on from experience, it's that you can't give a hero **everything** (see season 5 Death Knights in WoW). 

* Three clones which make fighting him confusing
* A stealth that doesn't break on damage at the start
* A talent that makes killing him even more impossible due to his  E now becoming Blink and a stealth mechanic at 16 available every 12 seconds (**and every 6 seconds at level 20**)
* Unstoppable on his primary ult, making CC ineffective at slowing him down

Am I crazy in feeling like there's absolutely no useful counterplay at this point? I say he's destroying quick match because at least in ranked you can ban him out. However, if you're in a quick match team that didn't get Samuro while theirs did, it's a complete trainwreck. I just got absolutely blown out of the water (6-39) because their Silver 5 Samuro was completely unstoppable.

Here's another piece to consider:
Hero League winrate in Diamond/Master: 66.4% (*buffed and then nerfed the next day Zarya did not reach this*)
Quick Match: 70.3% winrate.

I know winrates aren't everything, but it's starting to get absurd at this point. When Zarya's numbers went up to this point, she was tuned down immediately. I'm also aware that Samuro isn't just a matter of turning down numbers: he is simply too good because his survivability is unrivaled by any character ever released in this game.

I don't even feel like I can queue quick match anymore because the entire game feels dictated by who got Samuro and who didn't. If both teams get him, then it's a toss-up on which of them can cause the most cause. It's disrupted the entire flow of this game and is the first character that I've ever actually considered needing to be fully removed from the game until major revisions are completed.

Is this too drastic? Are there changes that could easily be made in the short-term that would at least tune him down to a point where it's slightly more manageable?

EDIT: A [patch](http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20324866/heroes-of-the-storm-balance-update-october-25-2016-10-25-2016) came out that won't fix anything regarding Samuro.

This queue was almost instantaneous. If I'm Diamond 3, I shouldn't be playing against 3 Platinum players without it even trying to find me a better match. The matchmaker in its current state is willing to hurt the experience of an individual in order to create an ""averaged"" game. I worked really hard not to play at these levels anymore, and to be put in a game like this is infuriating. My entire team spent the whole game saying I hope I continue my losing streak because I banned Gazlowe to make sure my teammate didn't take it. Perhaps that's considered a ""dick move"", but I absolutely didn't want that character on my team and I pleaded with him to not take it. I reported all of them for intentionally dying, but let's face it, reports don't work outside of the automated chat bans.

It's not fair that just because I want to play in the mornings instead of the evenings that I get the short end of the stick. I'm scared to even queue anymore because I don't know what kind of trainwreck game I'm going to get next.

I'm not sure if this is a stretch to make a post like this, but I've been floating around 3k-3.1k MMR now and I'm clearly not progressing higher at this point. Would there be any top 200 HL players willing to take on a student that wants to get to similar ratings? I'm not exactly sure what that would entail yet, but maybe just asking questions/occasional replay review? I have basic mechanics down, but have some questions like who to pick when, best roles to stick to, etc. The NA tag is simply because I'm NA and it might be easier to communicate/share replays, but I'm totally open to help from other regions. I'd kill to make that leaderboard just once, and maybe someone out there would be willing to coach me there.

Thank you for your time!

So I'll finally be applying this June and here's where I'll be at:

* ~3.0 GPA, higher sGPA (can't remember exactly)
* 28 MCAT (7/12/9)
* 200 hours clinical volunteering.
* Shadowing (Will make sure this is completed before applying)

Quite frankly, I don't think I'm going to make the cut. I know that the MCAT only lasts three years and I've already wasted one, so if I don't get accepted, I figure I will need to be doing something during the next year so that my final chance at applying doesn't go to waste. Here are some of the options I have:

1) I can just continue to retake the same boring classes I've seen before that aren't science related in order to bring my GPA higher.
2) I can apply to a local school's 1-year MPH program.
3) ??

I'm not exactly sure what to do at this point. I am hopefully going to be accepted for the full-time supervisor position above me, so I was hoping that this upcoming Spring semester would be the last one and they could just build a schedule around that. However, if I need to continue taking classes, I'll work with them to figure out something (education &gt; work).

I'm all ears for ideas of what I should do. Thanks for your time!

EDIT: I should note that I'm already doing retakes and will have that GPA *at the time of applying*. I'm not already there.

I've played a lot of different games and none of them are as lenient as this one is. A starting ban should be a week, and each disconnect after that should add a week to your subsequent bans.

Don't play the game then. It's not fair to your teammates and it's selfish of you to put each team you join under the threat of your instability.
