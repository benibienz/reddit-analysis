But we here are the other way. We're not comfortable with the idea of mass deportation of muslims or illegals because don't want to unjustly punish a good hearted person because we dont know "" whats in their hearts"".

Given the fact that white fertility rates are the lowest, and old republicans are dying and being replaced by new young democrats. The US will never be red again, if trump doesn't win now.
