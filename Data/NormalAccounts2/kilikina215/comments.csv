0,"Yeah DVD's, Playstation 1 games, and original Xbox games are much more forgiving. Newer games and blu-rays can be a bit tricky. I just learned the water trick a year ago. If the blue pad has been sitting for longer then a month I use the water trick just to soften it up. I almost never use the white solution. The blue stuff works great for like 80% of the things I buff. ",2016-07-12 18:08:44+00:00,d59ht68,4,t1_d59hj85,342,Flipping
1,I have 2. I got one that's heavy duty I got when Blockbuster was going out of business and then got the newer smaller one. Both work GREAT. I took a GameCube game (it was Super Smash so I was hoping their machine would be better) to a shop with one of those really fancy disc repair machines and the game still didn't work. I used the heavy duty one(it works with GameCube games the newer one does not) and it worked better then the fancy more expensive one. I've never not fixed a disc unless it had deep scratches which you can usually feel. I highly recommend it. And yes very lightly spray the pads before using. I use the blue stuff more then the white so always keep extra of those. ,2016-07-12 17:55:37+00:00,d59h6au,1,t3_4shuwf,5621,Flipping

11,I have a friend in Grand Rapids that I visit and my husband and I always stop by the Goodwill outlet there and don't really find much. The Goodwills in that area aren't that great.

30,I stopped selling items like these on Amazon because people almost always complain they are broken when I know they are not. I sold 2 PS2 controllers recently. I tested them and they worked.
