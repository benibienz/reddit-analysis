I'm trying to find the laws for the area which seems to be a bit tricky. Me and my husband have been wanting to try diving for awhile but very nervous about going. I've done it at apartments we have lived in but now we have a house and dumpster diving in my own trash would just be sad. We would love to actually go out and try it. ,DumpsterDiving,"Anyone is Madison, WI?

My TRU had 3 Fox. They also had all of the 8-bit plushes. So if you live close to one you might wanna pop in and check. I also was able to get all 3 Zelda micro sets. ,WorldOfNintendo,Toys R Us Stock,http://www.reddit.com/r/WorldOfNintendo/comments/3f7f08/toys_r_us_stock/
