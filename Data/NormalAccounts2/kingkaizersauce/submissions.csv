I've found out from a neighbor that my tenant has been in hospital for a few days and has undergone unsuccessful surgery which was to remove a cancerous tumor of sorts, he told me that the cancer has spread and he might not live very long, a year at the most.


Should I go round and see him now that he's home? He's never directly told me he's ill or anything so I'm not sure if I should just leave it?

A user reported her printer was not working late on Friday, I had look at it and it was the paper mechanism not picking up the paper, the printer was quite cheap so I told her I'd order a new one but it wouldn't be until next week as I can get a replacement much cheaper if I bundle it in with another order I'm building up. 

During my time looking at the printer, she kept talking about how she has one at home that is cheap and we could buy a similar one and that she's had it for years etc

The main office printer is just a few feet away outside her area so it's not like she doesn't have access to one in the meantime.


It's the first day back in the office and I've been told that she's brought her home printer in and has been asking her colleague to set it up for her.

I bet she think's I'll be providing the ink cartridges now.

Update: She approached my boss while I was away from my desk a short time ago ref her printer and he's made the decision to not get her a replacement printer (cost cutting and the fact there's the main MFP on her doorstep), I think she will escalate to her manager (Finance Director) but he's the one who's told us to cost cut so the lesson here is she should have waited!",talesfromtechsupport,I have one at home,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4luoxu/i_have_one_at_home/

&gt; **SalesGirl**:  Hi - my work printer at home isn't working - I did some reading on google and it said it could be a faulty printhead, please can you arrange a new one or printer?

&gt; **Me**: Hi **SalesGirl**, I can talk you through some basic checks to see if that's the case, there should also be a diagnostic tool installed on your laptop, I'll call you in 5 minutes to run through ok?

&gt; **SalesGirl**: I've left my laptop on at home so you can connect in but I'm at the airport about to go *EuropeanCity* and I'm back on Tuesday so let me know how it goes, thanks :)

On Friday he was complaining about his PC going all jelly and doing blue screens and locking up when he tried working on his Solidworks. My colleague had a brief look but his ticket came in a few minutes before we finished so it was left me to look at the next day as I was planning to do a few extra hours last weekend and catch up on some upgrades.

I started his PC and just before I could login it blue screened, so I opened up the case, and everything looked ok apart from one thing, this was a high end PC, and I know it came with a very good graphics card (I ordered it), the card was installed was a Radeon 5450. I put everything back and then sent an email to my colleague/manager copying in his manager and department head to let them know that our £4000 graphics card was missing hence why this shit wasn’t working and wasn’t going to work for his type of applications.

This chap has a password made up of 4 random words (I have no idea why), it has the word bingo in it, I spent the rest of the weekend randomly shouting **BINGO** as I worked, hey **BINGO!**

This morning he was given his marching orders, he’s brought card back I believe and handed it to his boss. When he wouldn’t get a response after 20mins he would always send an email starting with “..do you mind answering me?” Today I was like **Do you mind bingoing?**

She asked me If I can access a set of files on his laptop (She even had a note with where they were saved) which is currently turned off in a laptop case, located in the boot of a car on the motorway currently being driven to a city 3 hours away.

I didn't respond to her straight away, took me about a minute before I said ""OK, so you want me to...""

At the end of the conversation she said ""Oh I thought as much, it's all a pain isn't it?""


Sigh.

I am 28/M living in England, life is routine now and starting to get boring.

I'm looking for somebody to talk to regarding life, the universe and beyond.

People have three faces: 
1. The one your family see (sensible)
2. The one your friends/ work see (fun, professional)
3. The real face, the dark twisted one that only you see

I want to get to know you and see all 3 in time. I want to know what you feel and think through your day, no matter how trivial or insignificant.

I am interested in the below but not limited, maybe you enjoy something which I may be converted to?

- TV Shows: IMDB top 100 , i bet you have your own recommendations?
- Gardening ( 3 years running, what can you grow, other than body hair haha)
- Aquaponics ( Still researching)
- Football or Soccer , Ice hockey looks damn good.
- The odd game ( SimCity, GTA)
- BBQ / Food (Whats your secret recipe?)
- Zombie survival (Bear Grylls who?)

What do you like? I enjoyed Jurassic World, did you? Bring you game face and PM me.",penpals,"28/M/UK - Just do it, what do you have to lose?",http://www.reddit.com/r/penpals/comments/3bctxp/28muk_just_do_it_what_do_you_have_to_lose/
