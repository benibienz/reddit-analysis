39,"!st step is having a farming base, -1 cup 5 seconds after you log off is better than -15 from being 2 stared. 

2nd is staying logged in between raids, move the screen every few minutes to stay logged in while you are doing other stuff.

3rd is army comp. You aren't going for 3 stars; loonion, gowipe, gowiwi, 1-2 hound laloonion, even gibarch.

4th is, probably the most difficult to get right, base selection. If you are attacking from air, look for grounded xbows and single target infernos make it a little bit easier. 

Extras: always have CC troops and at least one hero, if the raid goes bad and you need the extra help to get the % for the 50% 1 star. If you fail 1 attack, consider taking a break. If your fail 2 attacks, stop and clear your head for a while.
