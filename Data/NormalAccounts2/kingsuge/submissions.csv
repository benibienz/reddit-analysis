We are pretty chill clan, we usually war non stop until we tie or get beat then we take a break for typically a day or so. We aren't looking to become a hardcore war clan, we just want to do better in and have bigger wars. we don't expect you to three star every single attack you do. We are just looking for clashers that are willing to put in some effort in war.

We are looking Th 7, 8, or a decent 10. We have about 5 solid Th9s so we want some more lower guys. We have preemies we are trying cut out of our wars. If you have an underdeveloped base, feel free to apply as long as you don't plan on continuing to rush.
We don't have any donation requirements, just donate when you can. Use both attacks in war. 

We are looking for long time members. If you want to check us out, send me a pm on here so I can open the clan up.
If you have any questions just comment or send me a pm, when you apply in game mention this post or Phunk Hu3.
If you are offended easily, this might not be the clan for you. We like to joke around quite a bit.
