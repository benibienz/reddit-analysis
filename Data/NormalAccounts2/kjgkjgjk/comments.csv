For men, a donor must weigh at least 130 pounds and be at least 5'1"" tall. For women, a donor must weigh at least 150 pounds and be at least 5'5"" tall.

men have more blood volume than woman due to more muscles requiring more oxygen and therefore encouraging higher production and also the direct effects of testosterone on red blood cell production
