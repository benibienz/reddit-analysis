This makes absolutely 0 sense. I know because I worked in a company that outsourced most of our production in both China and Mexico. We had to hired a Chinese engineer to make quality control in China. Bringing the outsource back in Canada would have meant hiring a Canadian engineer + all the low level job (which is good for low educated people BTW) instead and would have not jeopardize our job a pinch. The company finally shutted down because outsourcing in these countries was too much a pain for logistics and quality controls.

No, they are printing it out of debts.

Then they use that free interests money (from the loans they have created out of thin air) to invest in all kind of unrelated businesses, like blockstream.

Let me put it this way. Before Theymos fiasco a majority wanted to fork, after the fiasco a shit load of people moved away because the situation stunk too much but only a minority held tight to the first principle of forking for bigger block.

462,"&gt; Ultimately the ""governance structure"" is supposed to be perfectly centralized. Bitcoin is supposed to be ""governed"" by the consensus code.

If you think consensus is built into the code you got it completely backward. Code can't achieve consensus by itself and has been mathematically proven to be impossible many times hence the byzantine general's problem. Satoshi bypassed this problem by giving an economic incentive to miners for achieving a consensus. Consensus is achieved among *people* agreeing to run the *same* code using the *same* underlying rules.  Because of this, a centralized governance structure is **impossible** because a centralized governance structure can't achieve consensus for people to run their code. It must happen among market participants, more specifically miners, which can freely communicate but this mechanism is totally broken thanks to compromised communication channels.

495,"&gt; Even though bigger blocks will reduce the economic incentives in the short term by cheapening block space, I think in the long term there will be even more revenue by allowing more transactions per second, up to a point much higher than we're at today

True but this is beside the point. What I am saying is that the discount is simply awkward and artificially reduce miners revenue per mb and block space bear a cost. Artificially reducing miners revenue also artificially reduce the incentives to secure the network. Considering both alternatives side by side shows that one give greater incentives no matter the volumes of transaction are being done. 

&gt;I don't see how giving signature data that can be thrown away a cheaper price is any different than allowing more script operations if they are easy to do. People adding lots of utxo data right now are just free riding, they should pay for their use of resources fairly

643,"&gt; A sensible standard is that we should permit that some are disenfranchised because of costs (they can only afford an old laptop of pi) , but not block whole regions due to lack of infrastructure.
Do you disagree?

Yes and no. There are still regions that completely lack internet connectivity. If there would be a standard, regions should be considered as individuals. There is no way on earth the network can/should please everybody in regard of full nodes. Regions lacking of infrastructures because they can't get their shit together aren't blocked per se and they shouldn't penalize the whole network. They are still able to use the network without participating on the infrastructure which is OK IMO. 

 &gt; Where do you draw the line?

I don't know and I don't think anybody can. Internet connectivity and hardware advancement are constantly dynamically changing differently in every country on earth. Keeping pace accurately for a general standard would be a colossal job. I personally think the network can take care of itself without any central authority. *Everybody* care about decentralization and security. Some people are too wreckless while others too conservatives but I think the network can find a balance on its own.

Optimization of block space and optional use of off chain solutions is good and no one is opposing it. Personally, I can't block Segwit and I am not completely oppose to it but it as some real concerns for miners (which are those who really can oppose it) because of that awkward economic incentive built in and I very much doubt it will be adopted ""as is"" because of that.

Considering that Satoshi envisioned that only mining nodes would be able to run large scale volumes on data center, it is arguable. 

Secondly, nodes aren't considered as ""economic majority"". The economic majority is people/businesses using bitcoin as money without necessarily running any nodes at all. ",2016-10-19 14:52:10+00:00,d8ys5w6,1.0,t3_58aj9e,1561.0,btc

If people can't use the blockchain it won't happen. And people won't run nodes because there will be 0 incentives to do so no matter how crippled it is.

&gt; Its also interesting to note that the subsidy got cut in half in july, but hashing power did not decrease in fact its still increasing exponentially.

Yes it is interesting but not quite surprising since a subsidy with no price increase lead to an increase in mining centralization consolidating the hashrate in the hands of a few simply because the reward for blocks gets smaller.

So the network doesn't benefit from an increase of nodes that can handle much more tx due to better hardware and bandwidth? REALLY?

Then the whole concept is failed because *tx fees* X *tx volume* is what's supposed to give the incentives to secure the network.

decentralized dtacenter**s**. People would validate with apropriate  SCV clients.

1409,"&gt; The increased rewards has led to specialization, which leads to market contraction (why are there only 2 major airline manufacturers?)

Wrong. Market contraction is just a result of narrow competition fields. Miners only have to compete for electricity cost which is what led to contraction and concentration in china and chip manufacturers.  It would have been worst without an increased reward. 

&gt;You think this? OK, I disagree.

Because?

&gt;Shitcoins are nothing new, and have been around a while, yet there's more value in having a common money.

True but common money is not possible with artificially capped capacity. Altcoins are not new but altcoins getting real market integration *is* ratter new. 

&gt;ETH is a ""World Computer"" - they don't even try to be money. It's a joke project with centralization and being unwound by whoever wants to unwind it.

Maybe but it does not stop ETH from gaining more project being built on top than btc ATM.

&gt;And soon you'll see ETH can only be verified by datacenters.

By decentralized datacenters? Maybe. If it ends up being enough decentralized while being more efficient it will surely get a shit load of transaction volumes. Regular users won't care in the end.

1410,"&gt; Why is the security we have today the ""correct"" amount? Maybe it's too high. Maybe it's too low.

Wrong. The more valuable a block worth, the more miners can participate to get a slice, the more hash rate there is and the more decentralize mining becomes

&gt; So no one goes to a fancy restaurant because McDonalds exists, right?

There is nothing fancy about bitcoin to pay more than the competitors.

&gt; Ah, the old psychic strategy of somehow figuring out what people are willing to pay.
Bitcoin competes against alternatives that are far more costly than $1 per transaction. Yes, the low-value use cases will move off-chain or to shitcoins. Not a big deal.

This is a bit pulled out of my ass but this is comparing the cost of using the legacy systems AND altcoins combined. Expect fierce competition while bitcoin is the only one out competed because of its artificial limit and stuck behind because of crappy and inefficient hardware and crappy internet connection.
&gt;ETH isn't a currency,

We'll see but ETH doesn't have an artificial limit.

&gt;Monero offers a different feature set than Bitcoin. Monero has 1% the value of Bitcoin, so I am seeing something differently than you are. Nor do I see any evidence Monero can scale better than Bitcoin.

1411,"&gt; Ok, so your assumption is no one is willing to pay a transaction fee?

This is not my assumption. People will be willing to pay the appropriate fees if bitcoin is competitive because miners compete for block space. Let's do some calculus. Right now 1 btc worth 600$ so each blocks worth basically 7500$ for miners. 1 mb block can only contain approx 1600 transactions which means to get the same amount of security with no block reward fees per transactions need to be 4.7$ per transaction. This, will never happen if there are cheaper alternatives. It will be a miracle if the cost per transaction raise up to 1$ and we should expect to see a big outcry from the bitcoin market if it gets there (without even considering endless confirmation times). The exodus to ETH and monero has already begun and from the current market condition there is no reason for this trend to change. So you should also expect a drop in security or mining consolidation/centralization after each future halving. ",2016-09-30 15:03:43+00:00,d88cwv3,38.0,t1_d88ccpg,775.0,btc

Now that's just for the marketcap which is not enough to get a full picture. To get a clue for market integration of competitors you'll have to check the news. Not bitcoin news but ""blockchain"" and altcoin news. Right now ETH is getting a good share of projects being built on top of it combined with major exchanges integration so what will be significant in a near future is monitoring trading and transaction volumes of ETH VS bitcoin. Another coin that has been integrated is Monero on the darkweb which led to a mini bubble. Again, we'll have to monitor it's trading and transaction volumes VS bitcoin in  a near-mid term to see the exact trend of market usage when the speculative bubble will have settle down. Other altcoins trading volumes aren't significant because they are purely speculative with no market integration. Some banks have shown interest for Ripple but I have no more significant information about it. 

What's interesting is that now the darkweb can use monero to buy drugs without even touching bitcoin since all the major exchanges have integrated ETH. If bitcoin remains uncompetitive, users will undoubtedly use ETH to get their moneros back and forth to their local currencies for this particular use case. I also suspect people to use ETH for international money transfer through different exchanges without even touching bitcoin.

1425,"&gt; What's the problem here?

There is a fundamental problem here. Who will pay for network security when the reward will converge to 0 if there is no market demand for transaction volumes?

&gt;So what prevents miners from creating blocks that cannot/are costly to validate?

If the network can't validate a block it will be orphan. 

&gt;Strange, I have to download the blocks produced by miners, which are born by all participants of the network. That's pretty much the definition of pollution.

This is the whole point of a blockchain. No one is forcing you to download it if you think it is pollution. I don't think it is.

&gt;SPV clients don't verify miners are following the rules. SPV clients have even accepted bogus transactions that had more then 21M bitcoins in them.

It doesn't mean they shouldn't be developed further and this is probably where energy should be put on, among other things.

&gt;So what would you consider a group of miners that control &gt; 51% of the hashpower enforcing it by orphaning any dissenters?

By compromising the network they will invalidate their own wealth from the market participants. The market will badly react and might quit leaving miners with worthless investments. There is no incentives for miners to do such a thing. Such an attack makes only sense coming from an external agent (banks/government) who see bitcoin as a real threat. That's why the bitcoin ecosystem must be big, strong and wealthy (by attracting new users) to face that possibility. 

&gt;At worst, Bitcoin fails? Yeah, that's kind of the problem. I don't want it to fail.

Great, me too. Then let miners compete for the block space, the market needs it and bitcoin needs the market.

1426,"&gt; Buzzword Bingo!

Let me put it differently. From the beginning miners has been competing to win the block reward. Now the system has to transition to a fee market which means the system must allow the market to decide what the fees should be based on basic supply (bock space) and demand (transaction volumes using block space) laws. If you limit the supply (block space) to 1 mb, then the fees become uncompetitive for the market beyond that equivalent demand. So let's be clear about this, if there is 2 mb/block demand but 1 mb/block supply, bitcoin will accommodate 1 mb/block to the market and the other 1mb/block left will be distributed to either alts or a fork. There is no other way around this. Fees will never raise beyond a certain point because the market will switch over something else, cheaper. 

&gt;Yup, but the users of Bitcoin do. The limit is not for miners, it's for users, who must accept what miners produce.

The limit was original put to protect the system from a rogue miner to produce a troll block. It's true that users must accept what miners produce but miners produce ""transaction confirmation"" *from* the users demand!

&gt;  So in your scenario, miners still have the cartel behavior as possible, but users cannot do anything to stop pollution from miners. In essence, you let miners have even more power.

There is no such thing as pollution. Miners produce what users are paying them to do. The only power you give them is making more profits by providing more supply. 

&gt;So how do users verify the miners don't cheap without bearing that cost?

Isn't the point of SPV clients?

&gt;Why does OPEC have a cartel? The incentives.

I know well the modus operandi of monopolies and cartels and of course there are a lot of profits to be made by artificially limiting the supply. But each one of them operates using either regulation and/or coercive force. There is no such thing on the internet. That why the artificial fee market where bitcoin is heading will never happen. There are no coercive force or laws stopping users from using competitors. The actual mining cartel has no chance winning over the market, at worst the market will quit.

1431,"&gt; They compete today....

Their competition ends at 1 mb which means they cannot be competitive for greater demand in a competitive environment. 

&gt; How do you measure the cost of block space for users?

We don't have to care about that. It's up to the miners to look at their operational cost and compete to have better hardware, better internet connection, cheaper electricity etc etc. Right now miners are concentrated in china because they don't have to compete for bandwidth but almost only for electricity. Users will adjust the fees like they are right now, although the system isn't limited at 1 mb but a floating limit set by an operational cost that should decrease due to competition and improving technologies.  

&gt;Well, nothing about having a larger block size prevents miners from enforcing it anyway.

I'm not sure what you mean by that. Indeed miners can collude and enforce an artificial limit even if we remove the block size from the protocol. That's called a cartel and that's bad for users because fees will become uncompetitve, which is the same result than having an artificial limit within the protocol. 

&gt;It actually closer to pollution caps - users don't want a polluted blockchain, so they set a limit they accept, and miners must make due with what they can, as efficiently as possible.

This is not my philosophy because I think ultimately only miners should bear the cost of running full nodes as they are being paid for doing the job. And as per the whitepaper they don't have economic incentives to collude and game the system. However I get the point your making and see value (although little) at letting individual being able to run a full node and it could theoretically work but would be tricky to implement. It's kind of the point of BU although nodes can only signal their capacity without enforcing anything and I don't think a single node should be able to enforce anything as we will be back to square 1. Emerging consensus looks like the most sensible and balanced approach to this problem. 

&gt;So how do you propose stopping miners from making their own soft fork to orphan anyone who makes bigger blocks?

Again that would require a cartel (sadly pretty much of what we have now). But why would they do that? I see little incentives to do so. And they could have done that in the past but never did (because the lack of incentives?)",2016-09-29 20:32:16+00:00,d87e4k5,26.0,t1_d87d0ar,1441.0,btc

&gt;The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest. If a greedy attacker is able to
assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it
to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to
find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than
everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.

1492,"&gt; I asked for it.

Oh cool, to build what on top?

&gt; Why aren't you using ETH if you think ETH is superior?

I did. I used to transfer money to US from Canada using bitcoin but now I can do it with ETH because the canadian exchange I use and coinbase have both integrated ETH. Since ETH is cheaper it was just a no brainer to use the last time I did. But this had nothing to do with its blockchain being superior in any ways, it was simply more economically competitive. On the other hand I really dislike the emission schedule of ETH so I would rather hold BTC than ETH but I am really concerned about the long term viability of BTC the way its blockchain becomes uncompetitive to use. If it's uncompetitive, you can bet no one will ever use it. Which is the reason why most companies aren't building on top of it anymore...

&gt; you can't force others to use your choice of software.

Right and it has never been my intention. I just hope that at some point people will get their shit together and upgrade their nodes to support bigger blocks and keep the bitcoin blockchain in the game (competitive). That's why BU seams to be the best approach to increase the block size, it's now up to the individual nodes to express how much load they can handle according to their hardware. When enough nodes are ready to move on, then the network will. This is emergent consensus toward evolution. ",2016-09-28 19:04:45+00:00,d85vvst,12.0,t1_d85uso7,1298.0,btc

&gt;~~Everyone~~ **No one but junk nodes** accepts the fact that Bitcoin can't scale very much on-chain because the security it provides is simply too expensive (resource-wise).

My BU node disagree.

No. That analogy is plainly stupid. A restaurant does not requires network effect, people go there because there is good food no more. Money on the other hand requires strong network effect. Limiting its usage will arm it. Plain and simple.

2798,"Yes being pragmatic about a reliable system is ""fantasy"". Yet you can't seam to be able to address any of these points. Good job. But I'm not surprised as it has been like that from the whole beggining of this debate.

To answer your question, I'm waiting 1-2 months after the halving to liquidate all my Bitcoins for the coin that will be the most integrated by the industry if miners didn't wake up that the artificial fee market envision by Core will never happen for simple economic reasons, which is my friend, the real fantasy here.",2016-05-22 12:15:29+00:00,d3f3w8s,6.0,t1_d3ewv6s,25339.0,btc
2799,"For several reasons:

1. Core devs successfully convinced miners that a fee market from an artificial block size limit must happen instead of letting miners compete to confirm the most transactions possible at the lowest cost according to their limited resources. Yet, this makes the bitcoin blockchain inherently noncompetitive regardless of any off chain solution they want to put forward. 
2. As you may know, the blockchain itself has a shit load of non monetary use cases that can't be put off chain, and this would be OK as long as the miners get their fees. Yet, on chain scaling is far down the road and companies are starting to integrate altcoins to hedge the economic and capacity risks surrounding bitcoin at this point in time. 
3. The artificial fee market as Core envision will make transactions unpredictable in terms of fees and delays. This is unacceptable for any individuals and businesses that want to use a reliable system for whatever use cases. 
4. At some point, when fees/delays will get too high, individuals and businesses will simply migrate to another system that is simply more predictable, reliable and cheaper. When that tipping point will be reached, the network effect will switch to another blockchain or maybe diluted to several blockchains (first scenario is probably more likely). When that happens, I don't see any reasons why people will get back to bitcoin even if it finally scales properly. The network effect will simply be lost.
5. It is prohibited to express any of these concerns on main bitcoin communication channels. I've got a perma ban from /r/bitcoin because of this. When addressed on these concerns, Core devs are being arrogant and dismissive. 
6. Every attempt to fork the protocol to scale on chain transaction **on time** before competition kicks in have failed. 
7. Despite the will to create the artificial fee market by Core devs, they keep saying that they have a 2mb hard fork far down the line (which I fail to see the logic here unless they want to play the central bankers). At this point, there is no logical reason for not doing it now since blocks are full unless they want to make a profit somehow with some off chain solutions (liquid being their first step).  
8. So on, I could expand even more if you want. 

What's next? I'm extremely pessimistic for the bitcoin blockchain which is sad.",2016-05-22 04:18:39+00:00,d3evjhv,4.0,t1_d3eubg8,2700.0,btc

That includes big block supporters and all the clueless users of big exchanges like Xapo, Coinbase and Circle just to name those.
At some point, if Classic fails or Core still refuse to scale, the next step will be what Satoshi has proposed as a fork which is to simply fork at a certain block height so the economic majority and network effect will move forward. No miners will stay behind.

2864,"&gt;Classic's proposal is 2MB hard-fork, which FYI also represents a ""production quota"". No block size at all is what represents a lack of said production quota.

You are right. Classic is a very modest increase that's why I do support unlimited block size and letting miners compete to provide the best supply according to their technical limitations. That way the blockchain will (and must) remain competitive.

&gt;However, an argument can definitely be made that people won't seek alternative systems.

Unless you are a fanatic religious, people WILL seek alternatives to unpredictable high fees and delay from any pragmatic point of view. I already am and exchanges are already integrating ether to mitigate the economic risks imposed by Core which opens the doors to lose the network effect. Good luck with Gregonomics and cripple coin.

3218,"&gt; Is segwit is second layer?

No but Segwit only gives a pathetic increase of 1.7 at best when it will be fully deployed and when ALL wallets will be updated to support it so it won't be in 2016. Considering the [pace of how transactions are increasing](https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions?timespan=all&amp;showDataPoints=false&amp;daysAverageString=1&amp;show_header=true&amp;scale=0&amp;address=), Core's road map *garantees* to stop it and will break the momentum of the network effect. 

&gt; Do you think it's easy to go back to 1mb once we're at 2?

No and I don't see what would be the point to do that.

&gt;It's mostly clueless people who don't understand that going 2 mb has repercussions far in the future.

Such as? What are the repercussions of 1mb blocks instead of 500kb? or 250kb? Is 1mb completely disastrous in comparison of 100kb blocks? What are the repercussions of 2mb instead of 1? 

&gt; Do you think 500mb blocks make any sense? 

As a *limit* it does make sense. Blocks won't get full overnight and miners won't produce blocks that are too big because of orphan risks. Miners should decide how large they want to mine a block depending of their own capacity limits in terms of bandwidth, storage and electricity cost (which they should compete for). That way the blockchain would remain competitive but hey oh, a competitive blockchain is not good for blockstream business model.

Since we are the ""narrow"" vision, why you still feel threaten by us? If bitcoin ""as is"" have no purpose for us, why you still don't let us fork and do whatever we want with it? Since we are the obvious minority, forking the protocol will have little influence on your chain, no?

Aren't you sick of arguing? Because I am. Consensus have failed, there will be consequences. Now deal with it. On my side I couldn't care less because I am more interested at using bitcoin rather than sitting on a useless pile of digit bits.

3696,"&gt; IMO, devs are #1 most important group, since they understand Bitcoin the best and at the deepest level (since they design the system + interact with the code to do so). Miners are #2 most important, since they secure the network from attack (and are required to upgrade BTC w/ new features).

&gt; Everyone else (users + businesses) comes later. Technically speaking, BTC is a p2p cash, so businesses almost don't even matter (if you wanna be pedantic about the p2p aspect). Users matter of course, but users can be fickle-minded and do not have the education that the devs + miners have (so their opinion should be weighted less, as far as the network's operation goes). We can't have Reddit mobs deciding policy (that would not be wise).

The reddit mob is not important. Those running the show will be the industry. Those who actually build companies, apps and all kind of related businesses to make bitcoin useful for Joe public who actually doesn't give a damn about bitcoin. *They* are those creating value to the coin. *They* are those who will chose the implementation that scales their operation regardless of miners and their silly internet connection. Bitcoin shouldn't not be held back because of these greedy miners that are shit scared about their profits and don't give a damn about the network. 

&gt;I don't understand what you mean by that. Explain? Don't look good, how?

Don't you know bitcoin Core does not scale because of the devs plus  Chinese miners and their silly internet connection? 

&gt;How will the 'market' be made not to care, and impose a different will?

By forking? Hashrate don't create value. Businesses and users does and value brings hashrate. I am not afraid to ditch Core devs and Chinese miners.

Bitcoin XT is an alternative client that have implemented BIP101 which will allow bigger blocks according to this graph http://i.imgur.com/QoTEOO2.jpg

Both bitcoin Core and bitcoin XT are fully compatible right now. Bitcoin XT will be activated if 75% of mined blocks are mined on bitcoin XT nodes. When that is reached it will wait 2 weeks, then it will mine the fist block bigger than 1 mb creating a fork and will be incompatible with bitcoin Core",2015-11-08 19:58:45+00:00,cwt6alp,1.0,t3_3s1gu0,480.0,btc

Nope. Technically it will continue to work but bitcoin works as a network so you will be alone in the old network so there is no point. 

&gt;Does it only fixed problems with transactions?

Yes and some minor bugs.

&gt;It probably wont fix the problem with it being to competitive that its basicly impossible to mine without a big server.

Unfortunately no viable solution emerged to scale bitcoin without compromising the decentralization at some level. It was anticipated by bitcoin's creator and bitcoinXT is just following that path.

No, These are just assumptions which I don't believe to be true.

Not really.

&gt;When Satoshi was in regular communication, did Satoshi explain why (or even if) he/she/they were anonymous? 

No but it is probably to hide himself from the power that be. People that tried previously to create other forms of digital cash ended in prison. Look at liberty reserve.
