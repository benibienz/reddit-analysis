44,"There's actually quite a bit more to this since there are so many PRS SE variations.  Standards PRS SEs are built in Indonesia and are solid guitars.  Generally they are still of a decent quality for a price but lack the maple cap and veneer (last I heard).  The PRS SE Custom is a Korean-made guitar from the same factory that does Agile, LTD, Chapman, Dean, etc.  I personally own one of these and absolutely love it.  I will say that these vary quite a bit depending on what year you get, though.  In 2012 there was a major redesign that added coil tapping, a contoured top, and bird inlays instead of dot inlays.

On top of all of this there are a BUNCH of signature models.  SE signatures include Tremonti, Santana, Navarro, Myers and more.  Each one has different neck profiles, different pickups, and different wirings.  That said, I've never played one I haven't enjoyed and would never try to sway someone away from it.

As for the SE custom, I feel the neck is a little thinner and wider than most.  It definitely plays quick.  Coil tapping lets you switch from a thick humbucker sound to a more single-coil sound.  Of course you aren't going to get the sparkle you would out of a strat, but it does give you a lot more flexibility with your tone.",2016-05-15 17:45:18+00:00,d36ilxb,3,t1_d36hbk1,2182,Guitar
45,"I've got a VKII 20 watt combo.  Love it because I can power soak it down to 1w which brings it to acceptable levels for bedroom playing while still giving me natural crunch without having to throw an overdrive pedal into the mix.  The cleans are decent but not on par with a Fender amp.  The distortion channel is decent but not on par with something like a Blackstar HT20.  All in all it is a 'decent' amp, especially if you can get it for a good price.

I will note that a lot of tone I get out of this amp comes across as a bit 'muddy'.  I've thrown an EQ pedal in the effects loop which makes a HUGE difference.  All in all this is a highly versatile amp that you can get a lot of different sounds out of, but it isn't one of those amps with their 'signature sound'.",2016-05-10 00:01:04+00:00,d2z9wsb,1,t3_4i8p1l,242943,Guitar

91,"1. You should try picking up anything you find interesting and make an effort to never stop learning.  I understand you didn't like your job, but that was really no excuse to stop developing yourself.  You can join coding groups, partake in hackathons, etc. to keep yourself learning and more viable/marketable in the industry.

2. If that is where your interests lie.  Honestly I leave things I know off my resume just because I know I would be unhappy doing them full-time. 

3. It really depends on what you meant by 'you didn't do well at interviews'.  Did you flub a lot of programming questions that you should have gotten?  Then yes.  Learn more programming nomenclature and processes.  Of course, no company is going to expect you to know every single thing they ask.  A lot of the times they are just seeing how you respond to being in a difficult position.  That brings us to the next question: did you flub interviews because you are not as strong as you could be in the communication department?  If that is the case then maybe you should find a local Toastmasters group and get some public/small group speaking experience under your belt.

4. Yes.  Join an open source project.  Write some proof of concept things using new technologies.  Polish them and show that you are a developer who cares about their code.  Companies will guaranteed look at your github profile.

5. There are plenty of .NET jobs out there.  Maybe you should start a .NET personal project and throw the code up on github?

6. I wouldn't necessarily say you need to be an expert, but you should know what direction Java is headed in and show an interest in it.  I would recommend [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Java-SE8-Really-Impatient-Course/dp/0321927761/) if you want to quickly assimilate the key points of 8.  Again, this just shows companies that you really do love programming and care about what is new and what is on the horizon.

7. Be honest: tell them you were fired, what lead up to it, what you learned from the experience, and that it was a wakeup call that has lead to you working diligently towards personal development in the future in order to avoid a situation like that again.  Then drop it and get back to your interview.

8. Who knows.  All you have told us is that you didn't like the work you were doing.  Do you like the business logic side of it?  Maybe you should be a BA.  Do you like trying to break software?  Take your programming skills and get into QA testing.  Finding out you don't like computers?  There's always Peace Corps.  Find a passion.  I started my professional career as a physicist but fell into comp sci due to lack of jobs/money.  I haven't regretted it a single day and I love my job.  Because of that I push myself to learn more which in turn leads me to higher salaries and bigger titles, which makes me love my job even more.  Sure it gets tedious some days, but good luck finding a job that doesn't.

These jet streams help dictate where specific types of weather are usually going to happen, so when they move, the weather moves with them. 

What this means is that rain was always going to fall somewhere, but with the jet streams getting pushed it is now going to happen somewhere where it normally doesn't (here).

I'd recommend [reading this](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/form-llc-how-to-organize-llc-30287.html) and then doing a Google search for forming an LLC in your state.

NINJA EDIT:  Don't forget since you are operating your own business you can start tallying ANYTHING you buy in support of the business and use it as a [tax write-off](http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Deducting-Business-Expenses).",2015-07-20 03:35:41+00:00,ct9byir,3,t1_ct9bu13,256,iOSProgramming

Again, if you are earning any kind of money [forming an LLC is cheap and easy](http://guides.wsj.com/small-business/starting-a-business/how-to-start-an-llc/) though rules can vary depending on what state you are in.  You might also consider reading up on the IRS site about [filing taxes quarterly](http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Self-Employed-Individuals-Tax-Center) so you don't get pummeled come next April if you have a substantial amount of tax debt to pay off.

154,"I am not at all familiar with Liferay, but I do a lot of work with Spring MVC which uses the same java/jsp system.  I think the first thing you need to do is really read up and get familiar with the MVC design pattern.  Here is your breakdown:

* **Model** - These are going to be your Java POJOs (Plain Old Java Object) that you are going to use to organize and ferry around whatever data you plan on using.

* **Controller** - These Java files will be the workhorse of your program.  This is where your action phase hits and this is where you need to get data from your models (database), process it in whatever way is necessary, and finally prepare it for the jsp files to access.  As I don't have experience with Liferay I'm not sure how it handles making this data available to the JSP, but I'm sure there is documentation on it.

* **View** - This will be your JSPs and they will do NONE of the heavy lifting.  The JSPs will contain a blend of HTML augmented with the data that the controller has provided to it.

From what I gather you can either call an action phase to re-invoke the java controller, or you can call a render phase in order to re-invoke the jsps.  I guess that the render phase would help add dynamic response (i.e. you click a checkbox and a new input element appears) though I'm not sure why you wouldn't just use some javascript to accomplish things like this.

I hope that helps a bit and with any luck someone with some Liferay experience can chime in.  I just hated seeing a question go totally unanswered.",2015-07-17 15:27:17+00:00,ct6mver,1,t3_3dmgec,6374,javahelp
