I flipped the breaker manually because this seems really suspect.  Am I mad in thinking that there might be a wiring issue in the outlet?

So I'm fairly new to the JS framework world (I make a living programming Java) and I've just started toying around with Aurelia.  I have already run into a roadblock which I'm sure will turn out to be embarrassingly simple but why not ask anyways?

In the 'Users' route, where is the list of users being populated?  I see an empty array declared in the .js file, and I see it being iterated through in the html to display, but I for the life of me can't figure out where the list of names is being populated before the api calls are made.

I've replace the speaker cable with a 1/4"" jack to, I've removed the old power cord and 'death cap' in favor of a modern grounded cord, and I am considering turning it on to try it out.

One thing that concerns me is I am still fairly new to tube amps and I noticed that the power tubes are different brands.  There is a Sovtek 6L6WGC and a JJ 6L6 GC.  I've heard some people say that unmatched tubes are a bad idea and I've heard others say it is fear mongering.  One thing I don't want to risk is damaging this head before I even get a chance to use it.

Any input?",Guitar,How dangerous are unmatched power tubes for an amp?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/3khjtw/how_dangerous_are_unmatched_power_tubes_for_an_amp/
