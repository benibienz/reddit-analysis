3,"The Second Coming - William Butler Yeats

Turning and turning in the widening gyre

The falcon cannot hear the falconer;

Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;

Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,

The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere

The ceremony of innocence is drowned;

The best lack all conviction, while the worst

Are full of passionate intensity.

  

Surely some revelation is at hand;

Surely the Second Coming is at hand.

The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out

When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi

Troubles my sight: a waste of desert sand;

A shape with lion body and the head of a man,

A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,

Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it

Wind shadows of the indignant desert birds.


  

The darkness drops again but now I know

That twenty centuries of stony sleep

Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,

And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,

Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born? ",2016-11-15 11:18:47+00:00,da14ggm,1.0,t3_5d086u,30168.0,AskReddit

As for apartments, your best bet locally is bismanonline.com. Craigslist tends to deal with a lot of oil traffic, so prices are higher and not a lot of selection in the area, more closer the Bakken. Most of the apartments on there are local the area and you can usually contact the landlord directly.

As for places to go/things to do, we have a newly thriving bar scene downtown... Lots of great places to hang out and meet people. Seeing as you will be here during summer and fall, the opportunities are wide open with lots to do both indoors and out. Biking and walking paths surround the city. We have some great golf courses and, of course, there the Missouri River and ask that you can do on there.

If you really want the specifics, I suggest contacting the Bismarck Mandan Convention and Visitors Bureau... They'll have all the info on local attractions and things to do.

20,"First off, welcome to Bismarck and I hope you find your stay here both pleasant and memorable. There are a number of options for taxis in town. There two largest, Taxi9000 and Metro, will have the most vehicles available for you, but none of the companies have a lot of staff on duty that have gypsy drivers just hunting for fares. Taxi9000 does take credit and debit cards. For getting around town, it's all about timing. Expect to wait during peak times (bar rush, both morning and evening rush hours) but usually you can get a cab to you in about 15 to 20 minutes. If you are looking to get to and from the airport, I suggest calling ahead and scheduling with the cab company to make sure you get to your flight on time. The TSA at the airport does have a lock out time preflight of about 30 minutes, so make sure you leave yourself enough time to get there.

43,"The Big Bang Theory (the cosmological event, not the TV series):

Breaking it down, into two smaller issues. The first is; taken into account that a black hole is a gravitational anomaly that is produced when a large star collapses upon itself so far that the escape velocity, or the speed at which anything needs to go in order to escape the gravity well exceeds the speed of light.

Now, Einstein's General Theory says that, in order to travel faster than the speed of light, you would need more than all the energy in the universe. 

Finally, the Big Bang Theory says that all the matter in the universe started at one central point, and an explosion caused it all to travel outward in all directions.

Here's my question; If all the matter in the universe started at one central point, wouldn't that have made the largest black hole ever? And if Einstein was right, then how did everything we know of travel faster than light to escape that gravity well? Finally, since nothing existed before that explosion, what could have reacted to that gravitational force with such strength to basically rewrite the laws of physics as we know them today?",2016-08-13 14:09:48+00:00,d6fvh1f,1.0,t3_4xgyjm,45698.0,AskReddit

Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate, we can not consecrate, we can not hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.",2016-07-28 10:38:15+00:00,d5u9g3f,1.0,t3_4uy0g9,35407.0,AskReddit

73,"Because of Napoleon's defeat and subsequent retreat from Russia, man was able to land on the moon.

In 1812, Napoleon and the French army engaged in a massive invasion of Russia. The Russians used a ""scorched earth"" policy, leaving nothing for the invaders to assist them while driving deeper into Russia. By the time Napoleon's forces captured Mosco after the stalemated Battle of Borodino, the Russian winter had started. Having no ability to forage off the land, and his supply lines massively overstretched, the French had to surrender Moscow and begin the long, bitter retreat back to France. Upon returning home, Napoleon tasked his scientists and scholars to dins a way to preserve food that would make it easy and safe to transport over long distances.  That work of canning and storage of food, lead down through the years to the invention of the Thermos container, which allowed super-cold fluids, like liquid oxygen, to be safely stored and utilized, allowing man to use chemical rockets to blast free of Earth's gravity and eventually end up on the moon and for his machines to journey to other planets and eventually to other star systems.",2016-07-01 01:48:57+00:00,d4ut3fk,1.0,t3_4qn2am,27968.0,AskReddit

143,"I know there are other ""young and behind the wheel"" stories here, but I'll add mine;

I was 16, had recently just gotten my license, and was driving my mom's car (we didn't have enough money to afford a separate vehicle for me). We lived in a small town (less than 1000 residents) and the nearest city was 30 minutes away. My best friend, who lived across the street from me, and I had decided to go to the local drive-in theater that Friday night to enjoy the show and just be teenagers. It was going to be a great night of movies and trying to hit on local girls that might be there. During the movies, it had rained a few times, once hard enough that the move was halted to let the storm pass.

I had a strict curfew of midnight, and this being in the age before cell-phones, didn't have a way to call home to tell my folks that the movies that were supposed to be over at 11 didn't end until almost midnight. Knowing that I would get into trouble if I was late, my friend and I decided rather than go through the city and up the highway to get back home, we would take the back country road that was shorter and get home quicker.

The road was paved, there was no traffic (this being midnight in farm country, there was no one else on the road). We were making good time, and I seem to recall feeling good that we might only be 10 minutes late. This is where it went south and I can only reconstruct events based on conjecture and court evidence. We came to and intersection with an unpaved road where the path that I was following deviated slightly to one side. The cross road, being unpaved, was mostly mud due to frequent rains in the area all day, and local farm equipment had been pulling onto the paved road, dragging mud with them, making the paved surface even more slick that just the rain alone could account for. Not noticing the slight change in direction, the car I was driving hit the mud and started to go into the right side ditch. Being a young, inexperienced driver, I immediately turned the wheel hard to try and correct out path. The front wheels of the car made it back to the pavement, but because I had overcorrected, when they got traction again, they shot us across the road immediately and down into the other ditch. We struck the far embankment at and angle, and immediately began to tumble side over side. Both he and I were ejected from the vehicle during the 5 complete rools the car took. I was thrown further somehow, landing on my shoulder and breaking my collarbone. My friend, however, was not so lucky. he was thrown directly into the path of the car, which came to rest upside down directly on top of him, crushing and killing him instantly.

Honestly, the only thing I remember about the crash is after. I remember screaming for help and trying to lift the car off my friend. After what seemed like an eternity, a car came along and saw the wreckage and stopped to help. The first non-fuzzy memory I have is the ambulance ride to the hospital.

There isn't a week that goes by that I don't think about him, and what i could/should have done differently and how my actions directly caused the death of another person and my friend. If anyone takes anything away from this, I hope it's that they realize that driving is not only a privilege, it's a responsibility to themselves and everyone else that they are entrusted with. That your actions behind the wheel can and do have consequences.

Sometimes, irrevocable ones.

TL:DR I was involved in an accident where I was the driver and my best friend was killed.

EDIT 1: Added tl:dr - sorry for leaving it out earlier.

UPDATE: To answer everyone's question, neither of us were wearing seatbelts. This is also one of those cases where, has we both been wearing them, we'd have both been killed as the car came to rest upside down on the passenger can with such force as to completely flatten it down to the seat beds. That's no excuse for not wearing them. And I do wear them, every time I drive now. As well as my passengers.  Also, this happened in 1981, and times then were different than they are now. 30+ years later, the importance of taking every precaution when you get behind the wheel still sticks with me.

Thanks to all those of you who posted kind words and encouragement. My story here was not my wish for karma or gold, but just for someone out there to stop and think twice when getting behind the wheel. Hopefully you can learn something from this.",2016-01-22 12:17:59+00:00,cz7o3dq,1.0,t3_424f2p,19579.0,AskReddit

199,"Several years ago, when I lived in Los Angeles, I was on a first date with a VGL ladyfriend. Trying to impress her, I took her to the Westin Bonaventure hotel to the rotating restaurant/bar at the top. The only way to get up there was to take the observation elevator that goes up the outside of the building. As we were going up, from the car you can see into the two towers on either side. About midway through the ride, I glance out and witness a couple going at it in the window. Light on, shades open,, he's doing her from behind and she's got her hands on the glass. For a brief few seconds, I get to see real live porn. This causes me to laugh out loud, and my date askes me what was so funny. Trying to not sound like a total perv, I mumble something about remembering something funny a friend said. She wants to know, but of course, stupid me can't come up with anything. We reach the top and get our table and drinks, and she asks me again. I confess to what I saw and she then gets upset because I didn't press the button right away to go back down to show her. We looked for them on the way down, of course, but they seemd to have finished while we were upstairs.

I was dating this girl in college for about 4 months. We both worked to support ourselves in school, and therefore had little time to see one another. Since we were both working so hard, we made a pact that school came first before dating.

That spring, she went home during Spring Break. I stayed because I had to work. She asked me to keep an eye on her place (water the plants, feed her fish, etc.) Did that all week. Was really looking forward to her coming back on Saturday, we we hadn't seen each other in like 2 weeks. When she got home, she informed me that her parents had come back to town with her, and that she didn't want to miss time with them since they drove 8 hours to be with her. Since we weren't really serious, and she wasn't quite ready to have her parents meet me, I thought that was OK. They would be leaving Sunday night and she made arrangements with me to go out on Tuesday, which worked for both our schedules.

Tuesday came and she called to inform me that one of her profs sprung a surprise quiz and they would be attending a study group that evening to cram for it  I was disappointed, but since school came first, I understood. I ended up going to a movie alone, and made the mistake of choosing a romcom. After the movie, I felt like doing something nice for her, so I went a got some flowers and went back to her place (I still had the key from house sitting). The place was dark, and I let myself in. I set the flowers down, and started to write her a little note of encouragement and thanks, when the door to her bedroom opened up and this guy whom I never saw before comes out in just his underwear. Turns out she had been seeing him since right before she left for break, and he knew nothing about me.

Was absolutely the worst feeling. I went from being all touchy-feely romantic to total anger and depression in a matter of minutes. I don't recomment it for anyone.",2015-10-01 13:33:11+00:00,cvkga61,1.0,t3_3mz103,81602.0,AskReddit

261,"This wasn't me, but happened to a friend of mine in college years ago. The names have been changed to protect the innocent.

A roommate of mine and I were in the mobile DJ business and we were booked to play for this frat party at the university we both attended. The frat was OK, had some good guys along with the standard self-absorbed douchbags. One such member, we'll call him Dave, and I knew each other from various classes we had together. We didn't hate each other, but we didn't care for each other very much, either. Different personalities make for different people, whatever. 

So, the night of the party, my roomie and I are working the music, keeping everyone going. I spot Dave across the room, making time with a girl I know from school. ""Linda"" is very nice, easy on the eyes but quite naive. Now, this being a frat party, the have limited refreshments; a couple of kegs and a large tub of this ""punch"" that was a 50/50 mix of fruit punch concentrate and grain alcohol, with some ice and chunks of fruit cocktail thrown in for garnish. The boys used to call it ""panties down punch."" Dave is talking to Linda, and plying her with glass after glass of this god awful concoction. Needless to say, she was getting hammered and Dave had that look that said he was getting some soon.

Time goes by and apparently Dave makes his move and leads Linda upstairs. Now, I didn't witness what came next, but I got the story second hand from several people. Apparently, Dave and Linda were getting pretty hot and heavy. They're both undressed and she climbs on top of him. Just as they start to get it really going, she looks down at him and says, ,""I don't feel so good..."" And with that she projectile vomits the entire contents straight down, covering his chest, face and head with punch, fruit and everything. What I did witness, though, was the loud, high pitched scream that came from upstairs, loud enough to be heard over the music and send several frat boys running upstairs to find out what had happened, only to come back down a couple of minutes later laughing their collective asses off. Turns out the screamer was Dave.",2015-09-14 19:22:49+00:00,cv1gqjx,1.0,t3_3kxal8,11445.0,AskReddit

VHS was cheaper to produce and your could record up to two hours at a pop, but at a slight degradation in picture quality over Beta. The porn industry (ever one to find a way to cut costs) chose VHS as their standard, and due to the demand for adult content in people's homes, VHS won that battle.

Pretty much the same thing happened between BluRay and HD-DVD.

It could have been when I was doing freelance graphic design on the west coast, and was working for a company that did phone sex lines. (These were pre-internet porn days).

I got called into work on my day off and he berated me in front of the whole staff because the girl's nether regions didn't look ""wet enough"", as if I was supposed to somehow Photoshop moisture onto her labia.

or it could be the time that, working for a cab company as a dispatcher, we got a call from this guy who was drunker than a skunk needing a ride home.

The room was spilt about 50/50, and when I asked why they were making their choice, it seems like it had more to do with NOT wanting to do it the opposite way than something positive. I then told them that in the future, there would be no such thing as strictly print or broadcast journalism, because the internet was changing the way their audience wants to get their news and info. Not a single student (or their professor) would believe me when I told them this.
