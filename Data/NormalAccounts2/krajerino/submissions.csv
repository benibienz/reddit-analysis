While working for a local new organization, I was asked to attend a conference in another city for all out porperties to discuss a new product roll out. We were all going to meet in Portland for 3 days to get a first hand look at said product, which would take two days (Thursday &amp; Friday). We all flew out on Wednesday, as the conference was to start early on Thursday, and ended up all staying at the same hotel which was across the street in the downtown area.

Like most 20-something males at the time, my fellow attendees and I decided to go out on the town. Seeing as we were already downtown, we decided to take the tram. Here is where the FU starts. We didn't really pay attention to which trams we were taking, and where the stops were. After a good night of carousing and pub crawling, we got on the tram to go back to the hotel. We we laughing and talking and having such a good time, we faild to notice to get off at our stop. One thing led to another and soon we found ourselves going underground, which we definately DID NOT do on our way to the bars. Panicking, and in a strange city on an unfamiliar tram, we decided right then and there to get off at the next stop and call for a cab. When we did get off, we found ourselves at the stop for the zoo, which is not open 24 hours. Access to the surface was bloaked, and our tram had left. There wasn't a schedule in sight to tell us if/when the next tram came through, and it being past 2 am, left us to believe that we were all going to be sleeping in the station until the morning commute started up.

Fortunately, about an 45 minutes later, another tram came along going back to downtown. The relief from my coworkers and I was almost palpable. We ended up getting back to the hotel around 3:30, and I crashed and got 3 hours sleep. Not an easy way to start the day.

I am not the handiest person ever, especially with power tools, but I try my best with what God gave me. My SO and I have been slowly working on the exterior of our house, trying to get the place ready for winter. One of my ""to-do's"" was to repair damaged cause by a couple of woodpeckers to the siding of the house near the kitchen.

I had take all the measurements, had my replacement siding in all measured out and marked up for cutting. My SO had recieved for Christmas last year a new mini circular hand saw. We hadn't used it since she got it, so I felt like this was the perfect time to break it in. I unboxed the saw, attached the brand-new carbide blade and it seemed to work just fine. Then I got ready to cut out my pieces of replacement siding. And this is where the FU happens: since neither of us is very craft, or has the huge outlay in tools/workspace, I figured that using two of our patio chairs and the edge of the glass-topped patio table would provide a perfectly stable cutting surface. Which it did, for the first 5 inches of the cut, till I ran the brand new saw blade into the edge of the table, slicing through the metal and breaking the entire tabletop. My SO watched in horror as tiny bits of glass rained down on our deck, into the surrounding grass and planting beds.

It took me almost 2 hours of combing through the grass and shrubbery to make sure I had found it all, sweating like an entre pig factory.. Looks like I will be making another run to the local home improvement store to get a replacement table.

TLDR; tried to be handy, ended up dehydrated and in the doghouse.",tifu,TIFU by trying to be crafty,http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3havfu/tifu_by_trying_to_be_crafty/
