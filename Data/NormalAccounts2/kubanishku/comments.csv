151,"&gt; Xugong V2 Pro

This thing is DESIGNED for the Naza, not APM.  By going the APM route you will not be able to easily integrate with the OSB + camera switching.  Search the RCgroups forums for people that might have built it this way.  But short answer is, you are building something that was *specifically* built for Naza integration.
  

Quote from [a post](http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2323506):
&gt;Anyway I am rambling.... the point here is that, as of the date this is written, the XuGong v2 Pro is only compatible with the NAZA flight controller. To be fair though the word 'compatible' is a little misleading. If you want you can stick an APM, Vector, KK2, CC3D, Feiyu 41ap or anything in there and it will still fly but to make full use of the full OSD you will need the NAZA GPS or failing that, a second standalone compatible NMEA GPS module.

205,"I'm biased, as I've only owned 2 transmitters in my life. One is a FlySky 6Ch (my first and works well for a trainer quad I let friends use). The one I currently use and love is the Taranis X9D.

It's on sale via banggood.com (US) for $168 so if you can dish out that much, its a perfect radio to have, and gives you up to 16 channels (with compatible receiver of course) + allows for expansion (long range 433mhz etc; via module bay).

The benefit to consider is the investment being flown (ie: your quad!).  A cheap transmitter ""works"" but here are some negatives to consider:  

1. Lack of telemetry, which won't give you feedback on signal strength and lead to a possible loss of signal.
2. Possible lack of FAILSAFE (if you lose signal to your RX your craft will just keep flying in the last direction you aimed it, at the same speed, etc;)
3. Single antenna vs dual diversity for most Frsky RXs
4. Cheap RXs typically don't support SBUS/PPM. They do single channel binding (more soldering of pins + more cables = weight).

Not sure why everyone always pounces on this (especially gun law related).  This RULE is true of any law breaker, be it guns, drones, or j-walking.  

I see this as a way to monitor / collect stats on usage and potentially use it to find someone who runs afoul of the law (registered and flew over an airport, etc;). 

I think the FAA doesn't know exactly how many UAVs / Drones / Craft are in the air, and registration will help them get an understanding of it.

As always people knee-jerk react on this stuff, and point out that ""evil-doers"" will ignore laws, but the point is that the idiots that buy 'drones' be forced into education about their usage, and maybe registration will help weed out ~~Phantom~~ pilots from flying over fire fighters as they work, *OR* near airports.

623,"You just need to go to parallel charging. It is SUPER SIMPLE to use, people overly scare you with things like ""it has to be 0.1v within the other batteries"" which is untrue.

Basic rules to parallel charging:  

1. Can't mix diff cells (2s 3s 4s), just stick to one (ie: 3s batts)
2. Can't mix full with empty batteries, or ones ""almost"" full or ""almost"" empty because the batteries basically ""equalize"" like buckets of water. If one was too full or too empty it would be ""pulled/pushed"" to in order to balance"" (this happens when you just plug all batts in)
3. Sum up the mahs of the batteries (say 3 x 1000mah 3s batts, = ~3.0A (would be a 1C charge per batt).  Feel free to mix 1000mah, 1300mah, 1800mah. Again think of buckets of water, they will just top up and equalize.
4. Follow standard procedure to charge (not on carpet, not on stack of old newspapers, etc;)

I use the [HK parallel board for ~$9](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__36907__Hobbyking_Parallel_charging_Board_for_6_packs_2_6S_XT_60_USA_Warehouse_.html) and charge all 6 of my 1500mah 3s packs at 6.0A (from storage charge).",2015-08-08 19:13:16+00:00,ctw5ixg,1.0,t3_3g91gy,13576.0,Multicopter

651,"Try taking the top CF off and take some close up shots of your PDB. This seems like a short or something is causing the issue.  Basically when you run into these issues, the best you can do is walk backwards by removing things until it 'stops' failing.

Have you run the Quad without an antenna plugged in on your vTX? Could fry the vTX and then it just gives you odd behaviour and very poor quality.  I'm throwing out ideas, but best bet is to remove the PDB and see what it looks like without it. Sometimes PDBs fail.",2015-07-12 23:58:36+00:00,ct15zeh,1.0,t3_3d1tih,10980.0,Multicopter

1. Reflow solder (your iron was NOT hot enough, need to just touch the pads let the solder flow.
2. Tuck your signal/fc wires under your flight controller, zip tie them if needed but don't let them stick out / dangle and possibly be snagged on a branch in a crash.
3. ABSOLUTELY make sure you cover your PDB board connections with liquid electrical tape OR hot glue, you are asking for a short if you leave pads exposed like that. All it takes is one crash, and something touching something it shouldn't. Electrical tape can be scraped/peeled off pretty easily.

666,"That's a lot to ask, have you checked any guides? There are quite a few questions you have an no simple ""one answer"".

My recommendation would be to find a meetup close by and ask to check out some equipment of other fliers if you have doubts on how it performs.

I've personally flown with the HK Quanum headset (v1) and upgraded to the Skyzone's (non 3d).  Have really liked the skyzones and have only used 5.8ghz bands.

Your Q on 2.4 vs 5.8ghz is a loaded question, as you first need to understand how frequencies work and their specific benefits. 2.4ghz has better penetration vs 5.8, but in most cases you won't care if you are doing close proximity flying. The lower the freq the bigger the antenna (so 5.8 is smaller than 2.4) etc;

I would recommend, just looking at guides, and starting cheap, and upgrading from there.  One person may prefer fatshark, while another swears by boscam.  Both avenues allow for upgrading your RX's later to 1.3ghz etc; if you want to go down that path.  

The Quanum v2's are cheap, and would be a good start.

Good luck, and seriously don't skip your research, you will benefit from doing some reading on the many subjects you just asked about.",2015-07-04 18:20:17+00:00,css53tx,1.0,t3_3c4go0,522.0,Multicopter
