It would heat-up a ton, and coincidentally there would be no video.  I assumed right away that this was a symptom of a dead camera.

I was able to take off with the quad after the crash, but landed for a closer inspection and found the heat issue on the front of the quad (very hot, heat coming off cam transferred into alumn standoffs).

I took the quad home and over the last 2 weeks disassembled and tested components. Here is the wacky thing, the ccd camera WORKS as does the Boscam TX. When I wire them up on a battery, I can see just fine and video transmits.

So I [tested the pads on the overcraft board](http://i.imgur.com/staNnar.jpg), and found that the TX pads (under/next to minimosd) didn't close the loop (-/+ under voltage).  When I measured the + with any other ground (-) I found see 12v (11.9x).

Not sure if this is a filter issue, that it burned out? Or it broke. I'm debating to just try running the ground off another pad (but I fear this will bypass the filter, if it still works).

Thoughts? Anyone have this board and run into this issue?
