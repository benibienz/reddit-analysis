Most apps install by dragging the application (self contained folder) out of a dmg file (Max equivalent of a img/zip file). So you open the dmg and drag the contents to your applications folder or where ever you like (cleaner to plop it in applications though) and then eject the dmg file (cmd+E if i remember correctly, or move the drive to the trash can) and then delete the dmg file.  

Some apps install with an installer, but most on Mac OS are drag and drop.

First of all the same amount of energy to produce the hydrogen vs getting it into a battery is minimum 30 percent more efficient in favor of the batteries and that's minimum, usually much more, then you have to factor transporting that hydrogen to a station. Also it's a highly unstable and explody substance. Do your research, because you clearly have no idea what you're talking about. You can't defy the laws of physics. Also the source can be clean energy, so your claim about it being from fossil fuel only applies to places that use fossil fuels to create electricity.

B. Who said it's the most dangerous? You? Also like I said, I've made over 20$ and actually some hours closer to 35$. Also Teslas start at 72,000$ not 90. Mine cost more, but just so you know what the real base price is and that's before the rebates.

Ontario’s Special Investigations Unit is reaching out to the public in hopes of connecting the dots in a fatal shooting.

Since the shooting on June 17th, investigators have not been able to identify the man believed to be in his 40’s.

The SIU have released three pictures of the male known under four alias names John Doe, Roy Norman, Chung Nu, and Jonathan Grant.

The incident happened around 9:00 A.M., Emergency Task Force officers responded to a trespassing call along the rail corridor between Weston Road and Highway 400, south of Sheppard Avenue West.

A confrontation ensued when police approached the male, attempts to taser the suspect failed, leading to an officer discharging his firearm.

The unknown male was struck and pronounced dead at the scene.

The SIU is urging anyone who may have witnessed the incident to contact the lead investigator at 1-800-787-8529.",2016-07-14 14:11:59+00:00,d5by420,2.0,t1_d5bwjqb,2540.0,toronto

2606,"The Tesla will be cheaper in the long run than any gas car depending on how much you drive (No maintenance, oil changes, great warranty, low insurance (In Canada)), So I tell them I look at total cost of ownership, not price tag. What's the point of spending twice the price of a car (just making up numbers for the sake of the point) when you can just buy something that doesn't need to have money spent on. It's the safest car in the world. GM thinks your life is worth less than 60 cents, where as Tesla is proactive about their recalls (one seatbelt in Europe caused them to check all cars).

For the Tesla is going out of business comment. I always say it's their choice to not be profitable, they are investing into growing the company.

For the range/charge time is an issue argument, I say if you're driving more than 400-500KM in one go, you should be taking a 30 minute break anyways, and in that time while you're grabbing food, it would be half charged. They place the superchargers in plazas and places you can do stuff. When I go to Montreal from Toronto, I stop in Kingston, and usually eat at the Boston Pizza. By the time we ordered the bill, the car was fully charged. Also if you're charging at home, it charges overnight, and you always leave home with a ""full tank"" as apposed to waiting for it to empty then going to fill it up.

For the efficiency thing. An electric motor is 2-3 times more efficient than a gas engine (there's no way around physics if they argue this). Around 70% of gas turns into heat and causes global warming. Batteries can be recycled. And if they give you the coal or dirty electricity argument, tell them a coal plant powering your car is still more efficient than their car, as well as it has the possibility to become cleaner over time when your electricity changes to cleaner source.

Finally, and this is my most important point. They are doing something No other company has done. Now all other companies have to do it. They could of just been a mediocre car company and made gas cars, but they did something for the good of the world.

P.S. Then I tell them about their sales model and how there are no dealerships, so they should go test drive one even if they tell the employees they straight up won't buy it. Then they will understand.",2016-05-09 11:43:50+00:00,d2yh0tg,1.0,t3_4ihmc3,33073.0,teslamotors

You can park next to cars and get out, all while getting kids in and out easily, and if you're tall you can just walk into the car without ducking. I've been in in the car. OK you can't put a roof rack, but you have two trunks and lots of cargo space. You can easily fit anything you'd put in a roof rack in the car, or on the hitch on the back end if you opt for it. What are you talking about regarding the door handles? They resolve all issues unlike other car companies. Never had a single issue with my Model S handles. The thing you don't know is Tesla doesn't do model years. On average there are 20 engineering changes a week. So today's car isn't 100% the same as next weeks car.

4259,"I went on a job interview for simplygreen. I thought it was a inside sales job, said ok. Went in for the first interview which was a group thing. They called me back for a second interview, then said I was ready for the ""field interview"". Shadowed some of their reps. As soon as I got in the car I was like, ""Shit, what the hell did I get myself into"". 

I decided to be open minded and see how the day went because even though I know it's not for me, maybe I'd learn something. It was winter, and we were going around knocking on people's doors. Some let us in, and one person was like GET OFF MY PROPERTY! Someone even called the cops for suspicious people. The cops just took our info and let us on our way. At the end of the Day, they dropped one person off, had a talk with him outside the van, I don't think he got the job. Then in the car they told me I got the job. I told them it's not my cup of tea. I think they were baffled by how long I stuck around, and then turned them down. Was kind of an awkward drive home. I think they'd have better luck if they just said from the beginning what the job is instead of being shady about it. 

You're right a lot of them say the Ontario Government spiel as way to make you think they are authoritative and that you have to let them in. Some were asking, should I take my shoes off now, or inside as if They ARE coming in. This whole part really annoyed me as I am all about having good communication and doing things like that.

4448,"If I could sum it up same happened to me back in the day when I hated Apple. I was a PC guy that built my PC as well. These are what I found happened to me and why I hated Apple:

1. People don't see value of implementation, they think specs is all that matters. So when you get the same specs on a PC, for double the price (Mac), your first reaction is WTF. The ""I'm a Mac ads"" made me hate them even more. Which leads to my next point.

2. Most PC Master race guys have ego problems. When you are presented with something you don't know, a lot of people decide it's a threat to their knowledge, then it's evil.

3. No matter how many people tell you, the willingness to try it has to come from with in. My AHA moment was the following: I was in highschool right before starting university (my timing could be off) at a friend's house and I told him how Macs suck, they only have one mouse button and you can't right click. Then he showed me the Ctrl click, and the two finger tap. I was like damn. I'm an idiot, maybe there's more to this.

Tesla's can't really be stolen,  so that factors in, whether you park on the street or indoors its a big one too. We recently had a storm in the summer and I saw cars that parked outside had trees fall on them.  What you're referring to is probably factored into previous amount of claims.

1. Different cars will expect different inputs/programmed differently so either they will have to have a crap load of skus, or have a crap load of programming and have it detect the car/model. Basically lots of work to get it to work in many cars.

2. No one will want to really retrofit something like this, especially as it will probably be expensive. I mean when it's already part of the car sure, people make a quick decision, but when they retrofit, it it's much more to think about let alone it will make their car look ugly on the outside and inside.

3. Price for convenience. I don't think it will be made affordable enough including installation to warrant something people already do without it. They might as well buy a car that has it in it already.

I think this is what Elon meant. It technically is doable, I mean anything is, but It would be stupid to even offer it as a retrofit that people might as well just buy a new one.",2015-11-24 19:26:47+00:00,cxbpl7e,1.0,t3_3u450p,527.0,teslamotors

Also not all materials are equal. Might want to do some research on that. There are grades. Same with metals, leather etc. Hence Aircraft grade aluminum etc. That's the grade, it's not all the same. It proves you don't know anything.

All cars do the same, and still German cars usually last longer as they use better materials. Parking them all day doesn't mean you live with them. Maybe that's the person's only car.

Even if your electricity source is not green (in Canada most electricity is green). EVs have a close to 96% efficient motors i believe, where as ICE have 30ish (numbers just off the top of my head). Also I went from looking at cars that start at 15k to the Model S. Why? Because they start at 15, but add any actual options and they all jump to 30k. Then I looked at a BMW used, which led me to looking at a New one, since warranty mileage on them are not so great. Then I crunched the numbers on the Tesla, and financing it, including resale values, and fuel savings, insurance savings, Warranty mileage etc, there is no smarter car. Yeah the price tag is high, but it's all about total cost of ownership. What's the point of buying something that costs 1$ then spending 10$ to fix, maintain it. Just buy something that's better and costs 5$ and not have to spend any money on it.
