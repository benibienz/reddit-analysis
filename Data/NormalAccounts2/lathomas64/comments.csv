Hard to say all together because there was a gap in the middle but started working on this back before i moved to PA maybe about 4 or 5 years since first got the idea that led into this.

It started with a video game I made for a game jam called ludum Dare. It was a super basic attempt at a turn based strategy game that didn't really get to a good state in the time allowed. Me and James we working on paper prototype after the fact to see what could be done with the initial idea and my co-worker at the time Mark said everything's better with hexagons. So we started fiddling around and came up with a pretty fun skeleton of a card game that we called Hexit Strategy at the time and did lots of play testing and tweaking of the ideas first just with each other and then with outsiders and at conventions and such. Took a break from working on it when I got my current job and then recently decided to go ahead and try doing a [kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/clichestudio/unbound-endless-war/) to get some momentum back on the project and possibly push it out the door and let the world see the thing.",2016-10-05 19:01:07+00:00,d8fe5we,2.0,t1_d8fbwb6,2737.0,AMA
8,"do you mean from a story stand point or how does it play out mechanically?

super short answer: A strategy card game where you place cards onto the board face down to build the map and leave surprises for your opponent.

less short: Unbound: Endless War is an area control strategy card game where you place cards onto the board face down to build the map and leave surprises for your opponent. You control a small fleet of ships and are trying to occupy your opponent's base of operations without letting yours get conquered as well. For example you may surround your base with tiles that are difficult to attack from, or place a hidden explosion hex in the path you think your opponent is going to take to destroy their troops and the nearby hexes.

Story wise there are details yet to be filled in but one side is a far off empire whose outermost scouts have reached this other force and the other is a group who has fought off the initial scouts, adapted their technology and are holding their own against in skirmishes against said empire.

**About**: 
*Unbound: Endless War is a turn-based, area control strategy card game where you place cards onto the board face down to build the map and leave surprises for your opponent. You control a small fleet of ships and are trying to occupy your opponent's base without letting your base get conquered. A cautious player might surround their base with high-movement-cost tiles that are difficult to attack from or place hidden explosion hexes in the path of their enemy. A more cavalier player could lay a highway of tiles to start harassing their opponent immediately. They'd better be careful though - highways go in both directions!*

103,"First of all, thank you for sharing your thoughts on this article. I'm glad you took the time to write out your grievances with this piece.

&gt;&gt;for the most part, women are expected to do a lot of these sorts of things in relationships and friendships, and men are not.

&gt;HUGE generalization.

Yes that is what for the most part means a generalization. She even goes on to say:

&gt;Like all gendered dynamics, of course, this isn’t exclusive to male-female interactions and the imbalance doesn’t always go in the same direction. It can happen in any relationship, romantic or platonic, serious or less so. I’m pointing out the gendered dynamic here because it’s so extremely prevalent and so very harmful, but if, for instance, you’re a man realizing that you’re doing the bulk of the emotional labor in your relationship with someone of whichever gender, you still have a right to try to sort that out.

So you're not really stating anything there that the author isn't addressing.

&gt;She says she loves men, but she doesn't seem to be able to put herself in their shoes. Take my marriage as an example. I count on my wife to do a lot of the ""emotional labour"" inviting our friends, organizing events, etc. That's because I'm busy working full-time (she is too). But when work is done, then most weekends I'm up a ladder somewhere doing maintenance on the house, or taking care of all the tech equipment in it, or in the office figuring out the bills. We're traditional that way. This is also unpaid work. I don't complain, and neither does my wife, we both understand that we have our roles.

okay good for you? You act as if this is a personal attack but if your relationship is so balanced then perhaps you're not one of the people this article is actually about. 

&gt;Although these discussions cause it to have a negative connotation, emotional labor is not inherently bad. In any healthy, balanced friendship/relationship, the participants are all doing some amount of it, though the total amount varies based on the type of relationship and the needs of those involved. Emotional labor becomes bad when certain people are expected by default to be responsible for the bulk of it even though we’d rather be focusing on other things if given the choice. It becomes bad when it’s invisible, when it’s treated as an assumption rather than as something that the participants of a relationship intentionally discuss and negotiate together.

Sounds like your dynamic here, Kudos to you sir you can carry on being great. A lot of people and relationships aren't like that. Although you mention household work Is your wife not doing any household work in addition to these type of things? I am not saying she is or is not but it is a factor to consider. Again if not and you actually have a balanced dynamic congratulations, but your situation is not everyones.

&gt;The other thing the author doesn't seem to get about men is we were raised that way on purpose. We are taught to bite down on those emotions and all that emotional intelligence. We are expected to take tough jobs and tough them out without complaining. We are expected to protect our families and be prepared to put ourselves in harm's way when shit happens. This is why we are a little slow at the ""emotional labour"" sometimes.

It's not exactly healthy or necessary to be closed off to all of your emotions to accomplish those goals.

&gt;Maybe it's time for all that to change. But this finger-pointing, ""men are so disappointing!"" way of going about it is so frustrating.

This article isn't finger pointing, it is identifying a type of imbalance that happens and acknowledging that while it tends to go one way gender wise it doesn't always. Acknowledges differences in skillsets and raising in how people approach and are capable of doing this work, and encourages people to

1) acknowledge the emotional work people put into things and

2) be explicit about what you aren't able to take on instead of just assuming it will be taken on by the other party or picked up by others.

This isn't even exclusively about Relationships if you read the entire thing, its an important part of all sorts of relationships including friendships as well. 

Might be worthwhile to explore why this makes you feel so angry. Do you feel like you are being personally accused? Why is that?

&gt; Path of Caine (3 point merit)
&gt; The adherents to the Path of Caine are fanatical occultists,
&gt; loremasters, and historians, obsessed with the study of Caine and
&gt; the mythical first city of Enoch. They search for signs of Gehenna
&gt; and revelations predicting Caine’s return. In all ways, they embrace
&gt; their vampiric nature, reviling anything that forces them to deal
&gt; with humanity or to act in any way humane. Founding precepts
&gt; of the path include meditation and introspection, along with a
&gt; complete focus on purging all vestiges of Humanity. It is imperative
&gt; that individuals on the Path of Caine be well educated in the myths
&gt; and history of Caine and Enoch; characters wishing to pursue this
&gt; path should have a dot of Lore with a focus in the Book of Nod.

&gt; System:
&gt; You do not gain Beast traits when performing a sin, as long
&gt; as you commit that sin while following the dictates of Caine
&gt; as expressed in the Book of Nod or while obtaining lost
&gt; occult knowledge. If you voluntarily ignore an opportunity
&gt; to study occult knowledge, you gain Beast traits as though
&gt; you committed a level 1 sin. If you voluntarily act humane,
&gt; interact with mortals other than as cattle, or deny your
&gt; vampiric needs, you gain Beast traits as though you committed
&gt; a level 4 sin. Followers of this path are called “Noddists.”

https://www.facebook.com/events/1399886113669022/

Description from the page:
Light-It-Up and Bangarang are teaming up again (A Surreal Year's Eve, Playhouse, Future As F*ck) to bring you back to your gaming roots!

8-Bit games were one of our first glimpses into digital art. Computers were trying to replicate real life and gaming pushed the technology. That tech grew, but it was still very limiting. Simulations were far from realistic and performance limitations forced artists to get creative with their designs.

These low-resolution images were misunderstood by many of our elders, but we didn't care, we thrive on the fun and colorful, and we were allowing our open minds to evolve. Now as we have grown into ""adulthood"" we look back at the aesthetics of this pixelated art with nostalgia. It wasn't always picture perfect or realistic, but we love how it looked.

Sometimes these technologies grew too fast to be produced with perfection. Sometimes they failed. Sometimes they glitched. Do you remember a time when you saw the game freeze up and the colors that you so admired suddenly splayed across the screen? Remember when you found a way to glitch the game to your advantage and the joy it caused? Now, there are whole art movements based around these distortions, these glitches: PIXELS.

What does the future of art hold? Let's get nostalgic. Let's get digital. Let's get weird. And let's push some envelopes and find out how evolved our sense of art can be.

We'll be featuring much of that booty bumpin' house music that you think of when you think ""Bangarang First Fridays"", but also exploring those chiptune/lo-fi sounds that resonate with our youth and some of those glitch noises that represent the evolution of our ears.

TL;DR... 8-Bit games, ♥ of pixels, digital distortions = art. Let’s bump it!

Instead of trying to decide what is best for someone else who was in no way asking for advice we acknowledge that they are an adult and despite having difficulty with some things are able to decide for themselves whether that difficulty is worth pushing through for the rewards they potentially gain.
