Hey guys!

I'm an EDH player who loves throwing my creatures at my opponent and seeing what sticks.  I fell in love with werewolf tribal awhile ago and I need help with tweaking my deck to make it real aggressive.

I know the deck is at 99 so I'm looking for feedback with how to complete it and also to make it move quick and stomp face.  I definitely want to stick with werewolves and I feel like this deck could move towards land destruction or green/red good stuff combos.

Any feedback is appreciated! Thank you for continuing to be a great subreddit!!",EDH,Need help with Ruric-Thar / Werewolf build,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/4qialr/need_help_with_ruricthar_werewolf_build/
