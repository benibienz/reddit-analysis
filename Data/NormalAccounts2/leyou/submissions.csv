I introduced my framework a while ago and there was some progress (taking into account the comments I received back then).

Let me reply already to the most recurring question (""what difference does it have with Symfony or Laravel?""). In comparison to Symfony, Asgard is designed to have a smooth learning curve and let you quickly create a prototype. In that regard I'd say it is closer to Laravel than it is to Symfony. In comparison to Laravel, to keep it simple, Asgard does things differently.

It is not meant for you to use it in production (version 0.*) and it's quite a big project for a sole developer. I'm aware some parts are not optimal, especially the ones inherited from the early days, and I'd appreciate if you could keep specific issues on [github](https://github.com/asgardphp/asgard/issues). I hope it doesn't stop you from looking at the rest and maybe share some ideas.

So here is the website: http://asgardphp.com (with the documentation and a quickstart tutorial)

And the repository: http://github.com/asgardphp/asgard

However if you only want to have a quick glance, I'd suggest to go through this sample project:  http://github.com/asgardphp/notejam (the notejam application built with Asgard)",PHP,Asgard Framework,https://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/4jxbdg/asgard_framework/
