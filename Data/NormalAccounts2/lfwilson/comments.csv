79,"Awesome! Thanks for the feedback. Here's some thoughts:

1. This is a great idea. Allowing the user to catalogue and organize their downloaded projects personally.
2. Agreed. We have an approval system right now to solve this problem.
3. This was a big one for me. There's nothing worse than downloading a project and it not working with your setup. Right now, when you download the app, it asks you what Inputs and HMDs you have. Similarly, when you upload a project we have a checklist of functioning Inputs and HMDs. We then only curate projects that work with your setup.
4. Totally! We've been focusing on getting the initial release out, but have tons of ideas on how to make the lobby more exciting.
5. Cool. For now you're able to delete experiences. Since we're focusing on small projects, I think it's totally reasonable to re-download something if you want to play it again (you don't save every YouTube video you watch do you?), although hiding would make more sense if you could organize the experiences like your suggestions in point 1
6. This makes sense. Currently it only works with projects that have been downloaded through the app, but it'd be easy enough to make this a reality

83,Very cool! I'll check this out tomorrow,2016-06-21 06:04:50+00:00,d4hon1y,4.0,t1_d4hlyiw,6207.0,oculus
84,"Totally. At this point it is up to the VR project to quit itself, but we want to require that all uploads allow the user to quit the experience without taking off their HMD. As a catch-all you can use Alt-F4, but it's definitely not ideal because it still kinda requires you to take off the HMD.  Most of the current curated projects can be quitted by pressing Escape

Edit: I've since gotten this working. In v0.1.1 double tapping Escape on Keyboard or Back on Gamepad will always close the running VR experience",2016-06-21 04:04:42+00:00,d4hlg8m,2.0,t1_d4hkwb4,1039.0,oculus
85,"Woah, I really like this! Feels surprisingly good. I think it's ideal for an experience where you would actually move with that hand motion - like a cross country skiing experience ;)",2016-05-31 09:24:01+00:00,d3q7069,1.0,t3_4jyc2i,1088309.0,Vive

87,"Agreed. I really want to get my hands on some motion controllers. Also the switch from 0.8 to 1.3 is pretty brutal in terms of what content is available now.

I would love to see a community of developers building small experiences. It's a unique form of VR content that I think deserves its own place, and I'm not sure that's on Oculus Home. ",2016-04-21 03:17:28+00:00,d2b9k9i,5.0,t1_d29qokb,91805.0,virtualreality
88,"Right! The type of content on those sharing sites is much different than the content on Oculus Home. What's the future for those fun, short VR niblets?",2016-04-20 00:22:36+00:00,d29mqrf,3.0,t1_d29knbx,2952.0,virtualreality
89,I've got Oculus Home as well. But it doesn't have the vast majority of the content available on other sharing sites.,2016-04-20 00:21:10+00:00,d29mohu,2.0,t1_d29civq,14075.0,virtualreality
