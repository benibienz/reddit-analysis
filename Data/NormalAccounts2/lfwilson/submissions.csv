We figured we'd open this thread to discuss what you thought of the game and solicit some of your feedback. We have some notes of our own, which include things like: improving voice chat fidelity, making the shield larger, and fixing some smaller cosmetic bugs we noticed.

I don't think big storefronts are a good way to discover VR demos and experiments. I also don't like managing the zipped projects I find around the internet. Maybe I'm just lazy, but the amount of effort required to launch a small project is often more than I'm willing to commit. On the other hand, I love viewing small projects to see what the VR community is experimenting with. Thus, a friend and I created a simple content management and discovery app called Feedme!

We think Feedme improves the experience of sharing, discovering and downloading VR projects. Here's an overview of key features:

- The application manages downloads for you. Simply click a Feedme link to download and extract. The application will prompt you to launch projects when they're ready to play. Install Feedme and click a Feedme link like http://www.feedmevr.com/feedme/46 to see how this works.
- The application curates new projects that you can launch without taking off the headset. After closing a project, a new project is queued up to play. Select ""FEED ME VR"" from the main menu to launch the curated project.
- Content creators can quickly and easily upload their projects to the platform and share Feedme links to the content anywhere on the web.

Although we don't have much curated content, we'd love to know what you think about this way of consuming VR. If you're a content creator, please consider uploading some of your own projects/experiments! Once uploaded, you can share Feedme links wherever.

A friend and I have been thinking about different ways of consuming VR via the web. This led us to build our latest project - Feedme.

We hope that Feedme improves the experience of discovering and downloading VR projects.  We've got our first version up and ready for your feedback. Though we don't have much curated content, we'd love to know what you think about this way of consuming VR content.
