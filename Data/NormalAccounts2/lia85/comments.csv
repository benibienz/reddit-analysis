1,"I believe you acted out by abusing someone in such a way as you were because you were still young and hadn't yet let out what damage your abuse caused you. it is best you seek out that person for their forgiveness though it won't erase your guilt. but you are also the victim. I was also abused for many years (7-15) I know that nothing will ever take away the pain and hurt it has caused me to struggle with all my life, and still now!!! I've never tried to seek out professional help. I worry that if I don't my future might not exist. but I understand a lot of what you are living with. I too, tried to kill myself. I still think of it sometimes. but no longer make an attempt to do so. I realized I've been so strong for years because of a promise I made to myself as a little girl. to always be good no matter all the bad I experienced. I can't give up. its not who I am. don't give up. your abuser is the reason you've had such a painful life. you deserve a happy life. though this doesn't take your suffering away. remember it. please take the courage I haven't yet found. and seek help. there must be a way. your not alone. I will never know you. but I will never forget your storey.  but my heart goes out to you. your not alone.",2015-09-10 09:42:44+00:00,cuwlarz,1,t3_3kaoya,45883,adultsurvivors
2,"Thank you, it feels so nice to have someone that might understand my feelings and experiences, give me that little bit of courage to do so.
