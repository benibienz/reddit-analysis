So while I was in the hospital, my SD bought me a vintage Oscar de la Renta dress and Chanel pearl drop earrings that I had been eyeing at for a while. I wanted a more Parisian look for our date to the opera next month to watch Faust. He knows me so well...and its made this hard recovery a little better.

Also, not sugar related but a shameless promotion, but because I've been under house arrest by my body, I've been working tirelessly on a huge list of orders for my heirloom dolls, and I wanted to show you my favorite. This is a fox dressed in the 1947 Christian Dior Bar Suit. I actually want to keep her to myself but she's going to a lucky girl in St. Petersburg, Russia.

64,"Long wall of text.

I'm in a similar situation with my second SD. I'm rather unconventional when locking down a guy, and a bit more patient when it comes to allowance discussions and gifts etc. My second SD hasn't promised me anything at all, and we haven't even had an official arrangement discussion. I want him to be able to know and trust me, and I feel that if I take the time to show that I can and will take care of him, that this is more than the money. I know that sounds silly, but the original vibes I was getting from him was that he was looking either for a SGF or more vanilla relationship. We slept together once, so he'd get an idea of what he was signing up for, but I will not sleep with him again until we talk about him providing for my needs as well. 

Here's my advice...give yourself a time frame (don't tell him about it) for how long you are willing to be around before you start finding someone else. My second SD has been given two months to show me what he can provide for me as well. So a lot of leeway in that regard, but when my time and effort for being with him run dry because of a lack of return, I will leave. The last thing an SD wants to feel is like a walking ATM machine. You have to put in the work, emotionally more often than physically, before he feels that he's getting a great return on his investment. SD's are looking for a unicorn just like we are. Be kind, thoughtful, generous with your time at first. I'd suggest not sleeping with him again until an official discussion about what yours and his needs are. 

If he's dangling the handbag in return for you sleeping with him, that's a red flag, without any other kind of compensation. If you haven't had an official arrangement discussion with him, that too is a red flag. But don't sleep with the guy just for a handbag or a quick buck. You wear the handbag, the handbag does not wear you. ",2016-07-25 12:40:57+00:00,d5pw4t2,1,t3_4ufufy,44854,sugarlifestyleforum

75,"Hello!

My shop is www.houseoflourds.etsy.com. It is going onto its third month of business and I have had only two sales. At the moment I am averaging about 25 views a day! Not as much as I'd like, and I've been working as hard as I can on SEO, tagging, photography and social media. What can I do differently? Are my prices ok? Am I competitive in regards to what I have for stock?

I have been branching out from polymer clay figurines to providing artwork, paper goods and wall decor. I have some plans for more room decor as well. 

Thank you kindly for your input. ",2016-07-02 22:51:15+00:00,d4x2l5m,1,t3_4qsnjj,108988,Etsy

I started my etsy shop two months ago and have had two sales so far. I have worked as hard as I can on SEO and photography, as well as content. Even though I am on vacation now, I am still working to put up more content and am steadily adding 2 or 3 items a day. 

If I can have your first impressions, I'd greatly appreciate that, as well as how I can reach out more people through SEO and social media. I have an instagram page but that is all right now that I am working on in terms of promotion.

Long story short, my dad and stepmother at one point were abusively consuming sleeping pills. My father tried to get clean and gave me orders to dispense the pills to help wean them off. My stepmother went full retard and lost control. 

The first incident involved her slamming my head against concrete walls and shattering glass and trying to stab me with it. I was in the hospital with a skull fracture and emotional trauma. 

The second time she pulled a gun on me it my father pulled her back and wrestled it out of her hands. He dragged her to the bedroom to restrain her. She is 17 years younger than my dad and a lot stronger. It took smashing a frying pan over her head to get her off of strangling my dad when she had the upper hand.

132,"Just woke up to a ton of messages so I want to put in my two cents about the service you pay for for this airline.. For a 15 hour trip like this, you get a lounge at the airport where you can take a shower, eat from the buffet, if spas are available they have it, and you are personally called for your flight. You drive to the plane on a private bus for either business class or first, and board. 

This is where drinks are served and you choose your three course meal from a menu. The door for your space can close so it's basically a small room, and you can have you steward make your bed as the seat reclines completely horizontally. You have complete privacy. The seats are made from the same manufacturer for Ferrari IIRC. They put down sheets, give you a duvet and extra pillows. 

You can order anything from the galley as first class has their own chef, and you can drink anything you want. I saw a man finish an entire bottle of JW Blue, I shit you not. The stewards come immediately when you ring them and there's wifi on board (throughout the whole cabin). 

Here's the thing, it's not necessary at all. But back in the day aviation was a luxury in of itself. Whether you could fly a plane or even ride one, you were a mini celebrity. But too often now it's become a game of shipping the most passengers like sardines from one place to the next and not giving a shit for the paying customers. Poor service, poor performance, and safety is now becoming a bigger issue. This airline is in the top ten for safety AND service. Whether for economy, business or first. Did I need to sit for first? No. But could I? Absolutely. 

I'm a huge advocate for the airline, and mainly fly through them in whatever class is available. Do I live a high lifestyle? Naw..I'm 22, a premed student. I have my own stationary company that brings extra income to afford how I travel though and I save. That's it. I also have an Instagram account to show for where I travel and am planning an expedition in the Canadian Rockies this year so if you want to know I'll post it.

Realistically, if a kid just showed up, I'd do open adoption. Here's the thing, it's not that it's a kid. The responsibility I simply don't want, the drainage of my life, my expenses, my youth and ability to travel as much as I do. I'm too damn selfish to want to lose it to become a mommy.

I'd look for good candidates that would adopt the kid as their own, and have distant contact, basically looking from the outside in to make sure everything is working out alright.

She was so obsessed with me becoming a little princess and fulfilling her fantasies of me getting married and pushing out babies that she can't take any credit now for me having that pilot's license or being in med school.
