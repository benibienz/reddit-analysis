I've been getting to know a POT while abroad. We haven't met yet, but we've been playing the five questions game. In one of the questions I asked what his budget for a SB would be. He wants to meet 1x a week while in town, for 10k a year and exclusivity. 

I think I already know the answer, for sure I have received far far more for meets between 4-6 times a month. I know my worth and his allowance doesn't cover decent rent per month. SBs and SDs, can you give me some of your input?

Hey everyone, thank you for your wonderful support. I read each of your messages and concluded that going to Cologne would be out of the question. 

Several red flags came up almost immediately after contacting him with my decision. The first red flag, when asking how he would pay for my travel, he promised to reimburse me if I paid for my trip over. For someone I have never met, this is simply out of the question as I know myself to be too trustful and likely to be taken advantage of. The second red flag, the allowance for three days with him would be 500euro. Can someone say Splenda daddy? I've been paid in the past 3000 a month for less time and he wants to sleep with me as well. I might as well become a street hooker. 500euro in Cologne may be the equivalent (purchase power wise) of 200usd. Maybe. I couldn't buy a round trip ticket and a hotel for one night with that kind of money. Third red flag, he started mildly gas lighting me. ""We started making plans weeks ago and now you've changed your mind"" - true but he never gave me the details I asked for weeks ago and most importantly, I specifically told him we would finalize details when I was in Europe and then I would give him the ultimate decision. ""I'm taking a chance on you too, I see something in you that's different from other profiles. I can't give you the world if you don't take the chance too."". Yeah well, then you'll see I won't fly by the seat of my pants the moment you mention money or an exotic site. The final red flag was he would not meet me in my own city. He absolutely refused, and yet he was adamant of me going to his location. I understand he doesn't want to divert his plans, but I gave him, on the advice of all the SBs and SDs on here, two options. To see me in Houston or to see me in Gdansk. Both cities I have people who understand my lifestyle and keep me protected. They know where I am and who I'm with and where I'm going. I don't have that in Cologne with someone I've never met before.

Ladies and gents, I am now enjoying the time I have with my family out in the woods of Kaszuby, eating freshly smoked trout that I caught today, and enjoying the clear air and silence of the woods. Tomorrow I am going mushroom hunting and berry picking as the rain has just finished, and then finish the day rowing my tiny boat around the lake with my pup. 

I want to thank each and every one of you for the help that you've given me, both SDs and SBs alike. This community has made me feel safer and less anxious. 

Much love to all of you xo",sugarlifestyleforum,UPDATE: SD Wants me to travel to see him please help!,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/4v698l/update_sd_wants_me_to_travel_to_see_him_please/

New to the sugar bowl. I have one SD right now, one POT, and another that wants me to meet him in Germany. I am located in Houston. SD going to Germany is from FL. 

Some background about the POT that would like me to travel to Germany: 

We've been speaking for over a week. I am going to Poland to visit some friends for two weeks and he asked that I see him in Cologne for 2-3 days consecutively with the promise of travel fare + allowance for the time I am with him. We seem to have some chemistry, which is great. 

Here's where I need help: I have been reading the horror stories of people being abandoned in other cities with no way to get back. How can I prevent this? Can he send me the money before I arrive? I understand that can lead some to think I may be scamming him, but honestly I am terrified of the idea of not getting back to Poland without a cent. How much should the allowance be? The last thing I want is to have my vacation ruined by some guy who likes to watch other people suffer. If I can get information ASAP from either SDs or SBs please don't hesitate. Thank you!

I can confidently say I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. 

I had called in a bee removal ""expert"" to help me relocate the bees in the soffits of my house and we reframed old comb and put them in a Langstroth. 

A week later I open the hive and find a massive infestation of beetle larvae. The old comb is slimy and the bees are dying. 

Here's what I've done, and please don't hesitate to tell me I've fucked up. I'm new and willing to learn: 

I have removed and thrown out all old comb. I've emptied out the frames and soaked them for an hour or two in a water and bleach solution. They are currently laying out to dry. There is a swarm which I imagine has a queen (during the removal we could not find a queen) and I plan to relocate them back into the hive with the clean frames and unused foundation. My plan is to scrape out any debris from the frames and supers and then collect the swarm. 

Looking for any and all advice ASAP!
