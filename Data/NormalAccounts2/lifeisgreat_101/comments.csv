3,"Thank you. I'm doing well, just the thoughts. They're driving me mad but I'm okay. Tomorrow's Monday and I can't wait. School is the only thing I look forward to push on life. Even if I don't like school that much but it's the only thing that has kept me occupied.",2015-08-16 15:29:14+00:00,cu4wboy,2,t1_cu4vzm2,698,depression
4,"Yes, I'm disgusted at how I didn't realise how low I'm feeling. The guards at school talk to me and would offer me a sit. It keeps my mind off of things. I started wanting to be at school rather than at my own house. I'm rambling, sorry.",2015-08-16 15:13:32+00:00,cu4vvjq,2,t1_cu4vrug,222,depression
