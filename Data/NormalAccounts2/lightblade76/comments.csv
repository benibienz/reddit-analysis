2,"She's told a lot of people that she's happy with not being in a relationship, so I guess that's a lot of her parents influence. She doesn't seem to want to take things further while her parents don't allow her to date. She does seem to try to keep me close so that when her parents allow a relationship, she'll be able to date ASAP. I don't want to make a move out of fear she'll ignore me like this more, and it's not exactly the best option right now. I'm gonna be out for today, so sorry if I can't provide updates.",2016-06-26 12:25:30+00:00,d4ojhkz,4.0,t1_d4ojdyw,329.0,relationship_advice

23,"I'd have to say the best option is to make clear how you felt when she had the relationship with the other person in Europe, and, even though it's not excuse, it's a reason why you had the relationship with the other girl. Understanding each other is a crucial part of every relationship, and I'm sure that talking to her about how you felt at the time will make things a bit easier for you. I'm sure she's reasonable enough to understand your thoughts, and if she's worth keeping, you won't have any sexually intimate relationships with other women again.

27,"It's somewhat relieving to see another 15 y/o in relationship limbo, but unfortunately, said limbo is a huge pain in the arse to be quite honest.
It seems to me like even though you would love any version of her, as you said, you'd much prefer to not be thrown in a loop every month or two, which is completely reasonable. If this keeps on happening, and it's as unproductive as it seems, I'd say do your best to help her through these tough times if need be. A lot of the time, the best thing people can do is just provide support through just telling others that no matter what, they'll have someone to talk to, or stuff like that. 
I presume that you don't have a drug problem, so having you in her life would most likely be a positive influence. To go hand in hand with helping her through her tough times, I'd definitely say try to be supportive of any faith related issues she may be having. I myself am an agnostic/atheist who has to put aside religious differences just for shot at being with a girl he likes, and I believe if the relation works out, it's completely worth it.
Overall, being able to just stand by someone and act as a crutch of sorts is really important. I'm sure if she has someone like you as support, she'll eventually move through all of this, and you guys will be able to pursue a productive relationship. Just keep doing what you're doing, homie, it's tough, but hey, what relationship isn't? PM me if you need someone to talk to at all btw!
