Everything was going cool, I was maybe gonna get a number, but then right as she and her family were leaving, stuff started going wrong. 
Everyone was hugging and saying goodbye and stuff, and she comes over to give me and my family a hug. So as we're pulling away from the hug, I didn't have enough room to take my hand away as it was wedged between her and a wall, and I end up accidentally POKING HER BUTT/UPPER LEG. I immediately broke into a cold sweat, like I was basically having a heart attack. 
To make matters worse, I was palling around with her brother bc he seemed cool and stuff, and I was saying goodbye to him, I think what I did sorta made it seem like I meant to touch her butt area (bro-shake and finger guns to the brother).
I don't see her often but how do I not come across as a creep next time I do. Any suggestions?",relationship_advice,[M/15] AMAZINGLY klutzy touch and how not to seem like an uber creep?

He essentially put all his eggs in one basket with the girl (15/F), and is having regular breakdowns in response to the breakup. In my group of friends, I'm the first person people ask for help or advice, so I've been stuck with him complaining for the past two weeks about her. The girl is also one of my close friends, and he keeps bugging me to ask her irrelevant questions about how she's doing, and when she'll not be awkward around him.

After the breakup, the girl did act all high and mighty, which probably contributed to his lack of reason and anxiety when approaching the situation. Sure the girl did treat him like garbage, but he's being completely unreasonable and clingy, and perhaps most importantly, annoying, no offense meant at all.

Is it bad for me to want him to stop coming to me for advice and help? This situation has been stressing me out for two weeks, and we've started exams at my school, so I definitely don't want this to affect my marks. Is there a way for me to not have to deal with him without letting him hurt himself or someone else? I don't want to deal with this over my summer vacation, so any help is much appreciated.",relationship_advice,[15/M] Clingy Friend (15/M) having trouble with his breakup is stressing me out.,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4p5tie/15m_clingy_friend_15m_having_trouble_with_his/

So a few months ago, a girl that I had had a flame for for about a year told me she was interested in me. Normally I'm ok with getting into relationships, but the problem with her is that her parents are incredibly strict on her dating. So for the past few months we've talked more, and gotten to know each other, but have never acted on any feelings. I'm completely fine with waiting until she's comfortable with dating, but it seems that she is either losing interest, or playing sort of hard to get in a sense. She quite often ignores me to see if I am persistent and strike up a conversation with her, or she'll get touchy in a sort of possessive way with friends that I'm close with. On the contrary, when I do the same, she seemingly overcompensates, and is rather watchful of me when I'm around her, and messages more often if I play 'hard to get.' All in all, our relationship is frustrating, as I don't know if I should move on, or continue to wait for her indefinitely. As far as advice, I want to figure out if I should move on for the time being, and pursue other relationships, or wait for her to be comfortable with entering a relationship. If I do end up pursuing another relationship, what is the best way to go about transitioning from her to someone else, focus wise? If I stay with her indefinitely, will I be wasting my high school dating opportunities with others? And I stay with her, and it doesn't work out, what do I do? How can I avoid putting all my eggs in one basket?

 tl;dr A girl I like plays hard to get, I do the same, our relationship is unproductive, she can't date because of her strict parents, should I stay or should I go, I'm stressed.
