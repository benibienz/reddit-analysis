1,"I use a bottling bucket with an [auto siphon](https://www.google.com/search?q=auto+siphon&amp;client=ms-android-verizon&amp;prmd=svin&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=shop&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwimx8GesLHKAhUBS2MKHcjVCQwQ_AUIBygB) with a hose long enough that it sits in the bottom of the bucket so that there is no splash. I've never had any oxidation issues. There are [calculators](http://www.brewersfriend.com/beer-priming-calculator/) that will tell you how much priming sugar to use given the type of sugar, volume of beer, temp. of beer, and style.

5,"I don't have an answer for you, but this is something I've been thinking about doing myself. I really like the Simcoe bittering Amarillo aroma combination.
