This is the recipe that I've been playing around with:
    
- 5 gal batch, partial mash
- mash 154F
- Estimates: OG 1.098, FG 1.023, ABV 10.04, IBU 19.7, SRM 18.8    
    
**Malt**

- 12lb Marris Otter LME
- 1lb Munich Malt
- 1lb Crystal 40
- 4oz Crystal 120
- 4oz Chocolate Malt    
    
**Hops**

- 2.5oz Goldings, Kent 60min boil
- .5 oz Holdings, Kent 15min boil    
    
**Yeast**

- 2 or 3 packages S04    
    
I have several questions. First I'm wanting to be sure I get a nice caramelization of the wort. Should I over shoot my total volume by 1.5 to 2 gallons and boil extensively to reduce it down to 5? Or, should I boil my 5 gallons extensively and top up the water to account for the loss during boil?
    
Yeast. I'm limited to dry yeast due to where I live. Any suggestions on what to use and quantity, since this will be a big beer? I'd like to stick with something that will keep me close to the style.
