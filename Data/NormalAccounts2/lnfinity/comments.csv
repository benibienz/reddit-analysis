**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

&gt; It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

&gt; A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

&gt; With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

&gt; A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range. 

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

&gt;Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/tips-vegetarians)**

&gt; Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12. 

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/guidelines-publications/n55)**

&gt; Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

&gt; A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

&gt; Traditionally, research into vegetarianism focused mainly on potential nutritional deficiencies, but in recent years, the pendulum has swung the other way, and studies are confirming the health benefits of meat-free eating.

5,"&gt;But, there have been studies, and there are some species of plants that have developed a chemical flow based system of impulse reception, and they use it to feel positive and negative stimuli in their enviroment. Not the ones we eat as a culture, but it's still technically wrong to say that plants don't feel pain while animals do, because there are outliers on both ends.

First of all, all plants react in some ways by having ""chemicals flow"". This is true both of the plants we eat and those we do not.

This also is not evidence of anything. My computer reacts to my pressing on the keyboard by having electrical impulses flow (which is much more similar to our own nervous system than chemical flow). If I knock over a cup of water you will see chemical flow. All things react to stimuli, but we know that alone is not good evidence that an organism can feel or suffer.

There is real research being done on the ways plants react to stimuli since this is an important area of science. I know that you can find sensationalized news stories being published about some of this research claiming that it is ""proof"" that plants feel pain, but if you go back to the actual papers being published you will find that those claims are not accurate reflections of what is being studied.",2016-11-21 18:04:52+00:00,da9s7x1,3.0,t1_da9r2m7,1370.0,explainlikeimfive
6,"For a couple different reasons. First of all, “all life is sacred” is either a strawman or a vast oversimplification of the position of the vast majority of vegetarians or vegans. The term “vegan” was coined by The Vegan Society. They define it as:

The same definition can be found in the sidebar of /r/vegan.

This definition doesn’t simply say that we should avoid harming things because they are alive, but rather we should minimize exploitation of and cruelty to other beings. While many things are alive, we exploit or be cruel to entities that are capable of caring about how they are treated (You can be cruel to a dog, but not to a rock, the rock doesn’t care). There are even some animals, such as sponges, that lack any sort of nervous system, and therefore there is no reason for us to suspect that they are capable of being exploited or suffering either.

Secondly, animals don’t just grow on trees. Even if someone did hold the view that “all life is sacred” animals need to be fed far more calories and nutrients in plants then we get back when the animals are slaughtered.

The routine use of low doses of antibiotics on factory farms to promote growth creates prime conditions for the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria, which pose one of the largest threats to human health. [80 percent of the antibiotics sold in the United States are used in meat and poultry production](http://consumersunion.org/news/the-overuse-of-antibiotics-in-food-animals-threatens-public-health-2/), and it is estimated that antimicrobial resistance [will cost 300 million lives and up to $100 trillion from the global economy by 2050](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/antibiotic-resistance-will-kill-300-million-people-by-2050/).

Raising cattle for food requires far more land than growing plant-based foods directly for consumption.

&gt;Livestock's contribution to environmental problems is on a massive scale and its potential contribution to their solution is equally large. The impact is so significant that it needs to be addressed with urgency. Major reductions in impact could be achieved at reasonable cost.

_______________________________________________________

PETA does have a high euthanasia rate, but this is for two reasons.

First, they take in very few animals. Having a shelter is a tiny percentage of what PETA does. PETA offers spay and neuter programs, and works toward legislative changes that will in part prevent unnecessary animals from being bred at puppy mills and by other breeders. They encourage people to adopt pets instead of shopping for them. 

Secondly, it is because PETA doesn’t try to run a shelter. They recognize that more animals are being bred than people are willing to adopt, and in many areas the methods of euthanasia being offered are simply the cheapest and most expedient methods available. PETA offers more humane methods of euthanasia to animals that are going to be put down in areas where it would otherwise not exist. They write:

&gt;As long as animals are still purposely bred and people aren’t spaying and neutering their companions, open-admission animal shelters and organizations like PETA must do society’s dirty work.

[Source](http://www.peta.org/blog/euthanize/)

Portraying PETA’s high euthanasia rate as a scandal or something to be ashamed of is incredibly misleading.

_____________________________________________________________________

With regard to your claim that PETA thinks it is unethical to have pets, that is simply false. PETA wants to reduce the number of dogs and cats being bred, because it is no secret that they are more being bred presently than people will adopt. However, a significant portion of PETAs staff has companion animals of their own, and PETA has stated their position on pets very clearly on their website in which they encourage people to adopt:

&gt; Contrary to myth, PETA does not want to confiscate animals who are well cared for and “set them free.” What we want is for the population of dogs and cats to be reduced through spaying and neutering and for people to adopt animals (preferably two so that they can keep each other company when their human companions aren’t home) from pounds or animal shelters—never from pet shops or breeders—thereby reducing suffering in the world.

[Source](http://www.peta.org/about-peta/why-peta/pets/)

____________________________________________________________________________

Finally, I want to make clear that I do not support PETA myself. They are far less effective than groups like Mercy for Animals, The Humane League, The Humane Society of the United States, or Animal Equality. They focus heavily on getting attention, regardless of whether it is positive or negative, and have often resorted to tactics that people rightly find offensive, and at other times have spread harmful misinformation. However, I do think it is important to challenge the misinformation that is being spread by meat-industry lobbyist groups against PETA in the hope that it will set back the entire animal protection movement.

Whenever you see someone making one of these claims I hope you will make a donation to one of the groups recommended by [Animal Charity Evaluators](http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/recommendations/top-charities/) as being the most effective for helping animals. PETA does not deserve your money, but we shouldn’t let animal protection be set back by false and misleading claims from meat industry lobbyists.

First of all, I want to make clear that I do not condone, participate in, or support any form of harassment through reddit. While I may disagree with people on reddit I will always continue to interact with people respectfully (as you can see in this thread), and call out anyone engaging in inappropriate behavior.

Only /u/unwordableweirdness has the context to provide an actual explanation for the accusations, but I am familiar with some of the surrounding circumstances, so I can speculate. The individual who has been sending out this message has been harassing them for over a year now (despite him switching accounts to avoid the harasser as is mentioned in the ""bot"" message (it isn't a real bot)). The person uses TOR to evade site wide bans, and continues to use a myriad of accounts to accomplish their goals.

I have seen the individual who has been harassing /u/unwordableweirdness posting pictures that were taken from /u/unwordableweirdness' Facebook account. I have seen them make accounts using his first and last name, and mention the city that he lives in and other pieces of his personal information. I have seen them make accounts that look very similar to his username, and similarly post his personal information from them. I have seen them use the accounts that are similar to his username to engage in discussions with themselves to get other people to think he is crazy. I have also seen /u/unwordableweirdness state in the past that the person also tried to call his employer to get him fired.

I’m also sure that this is just the tip of the iceberg as far as what the person has done since, for the most part, I have tried to just ignore and avoid the drama. A great deal of this has taken place on /r/drama, and the mods there, throughout all of this, have refused to take action against the perpetrator, claiming that there is no clear evidence that any of the personal information being released is connected to /u/unwordableweirdness’ account. There have been a few instances where the admins have stepped in, removing posts and deleting accounts used by the perpetrator, but relying on the admins can take days and the perpetrator has evaded site wide bans, continuing to make new accounts.

The /r/drama mods have aided the harasser in allowing personal information to be released and fabricating false information for the sake of drama, and now the harasser is accusing others of the behaviors that they are guilty of. I was unfortunately included in this, along with the others whose usernames are listed, solely because we often comment in favor of protecting farmed animals from abuse, and it is clear that this is a serious motive behind the behavior of the person engaging in the harassment.

47,"I’ve seen this talking point from hunters numerous times, and while hunting is certainly less cruel than supporting factory farming, no, I don’t think having untrained people go out and shoot at wild animals from a distance is an effective method of conservation or population control. Many people don’t realize that policies have been put in place in many places to propagate the problems that hunters claim they are solving because there is this demand for hunting. The government often kills off predators to keep populations of frequently hunted animals high. Rules regarding what animals can be shot are designed to maximize the number of animals that are born and survive to reproductive age before being killed, instead of minimizing the number of animals that need to be killed to prevent overpopulation. 

I do think the suffering of animals in the wild is an important issue that we should take seriously and try to lessen to the extent that we can confidently do so (check out /r/wildanimalsuffering).

59,"I won’t try to argue that it is easy to formulate a plant-based diet for a carnivorous animal. In solving the problem for house cats the people formulating these solutions have drawn upon decades of knowledge and research on feline health and nutrition. They have reviewed thousands of veterinary case studies, and many more pieces of veterinary information. They have depended upon advancements in the fields of chemistry and engineering that make sourcing nutrients from non-animal sources possible (and often times even cheaper). 

When it comes to why more people don’t do it I can only speculate, but my hypothesis based upon the interactions I have had with people is that many people are unaware of what is available or the problems that have already been solved. 

When the topic of feeding cats vegan diets comes up the most common thing I see from the least informed people is simply “obligate carnivore”. These people have heard that term somewhere before, and aren’t willing to consider any specific reasons for why a cat must eat meat, they simply want to repeat that it is necessary using a different phrase.

When people are pressed, the next most common thing I see is that cats need taurine in their diet. While this is entirely true, [synthetic taurine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurine#Synthesis_and_biosynthesis) is commonly added to both vegan and non-vegan cat foods and has been for a long time.

The most informed people on the subject bring up a few other points such as cats’ need for preformed vitamin A, vitamin D3, arachidonic acid, and the risk of urinary tract issues from excess minerals in their diets (along with a handful of other things). These are all real issues for cats, and they have all been addressed by commercially available cat foods that already exist on the market such as [Ami Vegan Cat Food](https://store.veganessentials.com/ami-vegan-cat-food-p2246.aspx).

Doing these things isn’t easy, and I wouldn’t expect a person without an incredibly deep knowledge of the dietary needs of the species in question to be able to do it in a way that is safe if commercially available solutions weren’t readily available. There still are plenty of cases of people trying to make their own cat food and causing malnutrition and medical issues as a result (both vegans and non-vegans).

We still live in a world where few people realize that vegan cat foods that do meet all of cats’ nutritional needs do already exist, and for cats it can be as simple as ordering a bag online or picking a bag up from the store. Few people are aware that many people have been feeding their cats with foods like Ami Vegan Cat Food for many years, and you can find Facebook groups with thousands of members that share stories about their cats surviving and thriving in some cases from birth all the way into old age on one of these diets.",2016-11-11 22:31:38+00:00,d9wgevl,10.0,t1_d9wespg,2274.0,vegan

62,"We have the technology to formulate diets that provide similar nutrients to these animals from non-meat sources if we so desired, but let’s suppose for the sake of your argument that isn't the case, or that it simply isn’t going to happen. 

Let’s suppose for a moment there are two types of animals that possess similar intelligence, similar capacity to suffer, and other similar qualities ethically. The only difference between them is that species A consumes species B while species B consumes plants. In this thought experiment extinction isn’t a concern, and species B can regulate their population in the absence of species A. If we care about individuals of each species equally (as we should given the similar ethically relevant qualities), how many members of species B should we be willing to kill in order to save the life of one member of species A?

I hope we can agree that the answer to the question in this unrealistic scenario is no more than 1 (and we should hope for a solution and try to seek out solutions where that number is less than 1 if it exists). There are some people who steadfastly and adamantly hold to the fallacious view that natural=good and would oppose anything that isn’t natural, but you have made clear that isn’t you.

In the real world things don’t exist in a vacuum like I have described above. Animals don’t have identical qualities. There are concerns about extinction. There are concerns about overpopulations and the suffering that animals will endure as a result of that. However, when it comes to animals being kept in captivity, and animals that are being farmed to feed to them, many of those other concerns disappear. Cats and chickens still won’t have identical qualities, but we ought to admit that there exists some number of chickens where the value of their lives (and the suffering that they endure being raised on factory farms) exceeds the value of the life of a single cat, and we should not be willing to kill more than that number of chickens to save the life of a single cat.

I think a strong case can be made that the number of chickens, or the number for many other carnivorous animals and their prey, is less than the number that those animals would typically eat over the course of their lives. 

Of course, we should still seek out options that cause less harm (such as formulating healthy vegan diets for some of these animals) if they exist. Of course we should take issues like the impact that these actions will have on the broader ecosystem and the long term suffering that might result into consideration. However, our goal should be to consider these factors and seek out solutions that cause less suffering, even if it isn’t natural, even when it means making difficult decisions between individuals whose lives and happiness are in conflict. There is no way that an informed person can look at these conflicts that exist and suggest that it isn’t at least a gray moral area as you claimed above.

If it is cheap to dump toxic waste into a river, but it will be incredibly costly for people who want to drink out of or swim in that river, there should be some legal recourse available. For some things, such as coal power plants, spewing some pollution may be inherent, and something like a tax can serve to properly price in those costs so that our market-based system can continue to function.

Animal agriculture contributes significantly to pollution of our air and waterways, and poses significant public health risks (from things like promoting the spread of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, or viral diseases like swine flu that could potentially spread to humans). In order for a market based system to function effectively, there needs to be some way for these societal costs to be put back onto those responsible, instead of being externalized onto society.

Yet, in the end, views changed radically. We live in a different world today, a better world today, thanks to the hard work of these individuals.

Change today takes place faster than ever before. [Interest in veganism is 3-4 times what it was just six years ago](https://www.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=vegan). Within the last few days Massachusetts passed a groundbreaking law eliminating some of the worst forms of animal abuse on factory farms from being used to produce any products sold in the state. Within the last couple weeks the two largest food service companies in the United States, Aramark and Compass Group, committed to requiring major reforms from their chicken producers, which will inevitably lead to less chicken being purchased. Within the past year, the trade group behind 95% of the egg production in the United States has committed to implementing new technology that will identify the gender of a chick before it hatches and end the practice of gassing or shredding newly hatched male chicks. Within the past few years nearly every major company in the United States, from McDonalds to Walmart has committed to eliminating the use of battery cages from their supply chain, which many in our movement would have thought was impossible only a decade ago.

These changes didn’t happen in a vacuum. They took place because of the hard work of animal rights activists and groups pushing for these changes. Many of them are the direct result of campaigns by HSUS, The Humane League, and Mercy For Animals, buoyed by the help of thousands of dedicated activists across the country.

[**EPIC-Oxford**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12833118)

&gt;Age-adjusted mean BMI was significantly different between the four diet groups, being highest in the meat-eaters (24.41 kg/m(2) in men, 23.52 kg/m(2) in women) and lowest in the vegans (22.49 kg/m(2) in men, 21.98 kg/m(2) in women). Fish-eaters and vegetarians had similar, intermediate mean BMI. Differences in lifestyle factors including smoking, physical activity and education level accounted for less than 5% of the difference in mean age-adjusted BMI between meat-eaters and vegans, whereas differences in macronutrient intake accounted for about half of the difference. High protein (as percent energy) and low fibre intakes were the dietary factors most strongly and consistently associated with increasing BMI both between and within the diet groups.

[**Swedish Mammography Cohort**](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/81/6/1267.full)

&gt;The prevalence of overweight or obesity (BMI ≥ 25) was 40% among omnivores, 29% among both semivegetarians and vegans, and 25% among lactovegetarians. In multivariate, adjusted logistic regression analyses, self-identified vegans had a significantly lower risk of overweight or obesity [odds ratio (OR) = 0.35; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.69] than did omnivores, as did lactovegetarians (OR = 0.54; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.85) and semivegetarians (OR = 0.52; 95% CI: 0.43, 0.62). Risk of overweight or obesity remained significantly lower among lactovegetarians classified on the basis of the food-frequency questionnaire (OR = 0.48; 95% CI: 0.30, 0.78).

[**Adventist Health Study-2**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2671114/)

Some of the major reasons motivating people to change are:

**Animal Cruelty**

Science is increasingly demonstrating how much we share in common cognitively with our fellow animals. We know that many other animals think similarly to how we do. We know that many other animals feel similarly to how we do. We know that many other animals suffer in circumstances that are similar to those that would cause us to suffer.

Additionally, the widespread availability of video cameras has made footage of factory farms and slaughterhouses far more widespread. Across the globe, and especially in Australia, people have [many examples of the extreme forms of cruelty that are common industry practice](https://np.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/56mrs7/debunking_the_farmed_animals_are_treated_really/).

**Health**

The World Health Organization officially classified [processed meats as carcinogens and red meat as probably carcinogenic](http://www.who.int/features/qa/cancer-red-meat/en/) recently, but for a long time we have known about the health risks posed by meat heavy diets like the Standard American or Australian Diet.

Additionally, the routine use of low doses of antibiotics on factory farms to promote growth creates prime conditions for the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria, which pose one of the largest threats to human health. [80 percent of the antibiotics sold in the United States are used in meat and poultry production](http://consumersunion.org/news/the-overuse-of-antibiotics-in-food-animals-threatens-public-health-2/), and it is estimated that antimicrobial resistance [will cost 300 million lives and up to $100 trillion from the global economy by 2050](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/antibiotic-resistance-will-kill-300-million-people-by-2050/).

These aren't problems pertaining to adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet. Monocultures, pesticides, herbicides, and non-native species are used when growing feed crops for livestock.

108,"&gt;I have a question to ask regarding how you likely view pets, and your ethics on euthanization, especially the high kill rate of your shelters.

I am not PETA. I do not run any shelters. I made pretty clear in the above comment that I was not supporting them and that people should not donate to them.

If you would like to learn more about PETA's reasoning behind why they euthanize they write about it [here](http://www.peta.org/blog/euthanize/), but here is a short snippet.

&gt;As long as animals are still purposely bred and people aren’t spaying and neutering their companions, open-admission animal shelters and organizations like PETA must do society’s dirty work. Euthanasia is not a solution to overpopulation but rather a tragic necessity given the present crisis. PETA is proud to be a “shelter of last resort,” where animals who have no place to go or who are unwanted or suffering are welcomed with love and open arms.

PETA does not take putting down animals lightly. The issue that there are more cats and dogs being bred than people are willing to take in is real though. Shelters are underfunded, and there are too many situations where nobody is willing to accept animals except to administer the cheapest and most expedient methods of extermination. We need stricter laws against puppy mills and breeders. We need better spay and neuter programs. We need people to adopt animals instead of buying from breeders.

In the article I linked to you will find that, while PETA euthanized over 2,000 animals in 2012, they provided spaying and neutering to far more. They have worked to encourage stricter regulation against puppy mills and other animal breeders. They encourage the public to adopt from shelters instead of shopping for their pets. Finally, they have referred many animals who can be adopted to local adoption groups and walk-in animal shelters where they have a good chance of being adopted, and they never go through PETA's doors.

Whether we should be killing animals so lightly at all is a good question. We should put more money into shelters and preventing breeding, so that no animals need to be euthanized. That still leaves the question of what to do right now before we succeed in getting that implemented. Perhaps you are right that no animals should be killed so lightly, and that the mass slaughter of animals should be viewed as just as violent and extreme as genocide, but it is difficult to deny that PETA's view that euthanasia is a ""tragic necessity"" is one that most of society would consider much more moderate at this time.

Once again, I don't think people should donate to PETA nor do I represent them in any fashion, but I do care about correcting misinformation.",2016-11-05 04:05:41+00:00,d9mibv6,3.0,t1_d9mgaik,3667.0,OutOfTheLoop

111,"&gt;I'm sure /u/lnfinity will have a good answer for this since she's the apologist in this thread.

**He** has told people that PETA has significant shortcomings and that people should not donate money to them in this thread... They have made lots of foolish choices, including but not limited to staffing choices in the past that I have no intention to defend. However, yes, I do also care about correcting misinformation.

First, let me say that I do not support anyone committing illegal actions. These tactics are not particularly effective, and not among the top interventions recommended by groups like Animal Charity Evaluators, which I mentioned above. Much of what the ALF does is not illegal, and only involves taking direct action to help animals (this could mean helping an animal that has gotten its leg stuck in a discarded net or breaking a car window to help a dog that has been locked inside on a hot day). 

The ALF is not an organized group as you seem to suggest. Any individual can claim themselves to be part of the ALF or their action to be an ALF action if they follow certain principles. These principles include taking, ""all necessary precautions against harming any animal, human and non-human."" [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Liberation_Front#Structure_and_aims) 

The ALF principles allow for people to claim actions that are illegal to be ALF actions if they benefit non-human animals, but no people have ever been killed as a result of ALF actions. The portrayal of such a clearly non-violent group as a ""terrorist organization"" is certainly unusual.

Obviously this loose, leaderless structure makes it easy for foolish actions to be taken, and given the public's general lack of understanding regarding what the ALF is it becomes especially easy for those who wish to use loose connections to the group to push an agenda.

The website that you posted supposedly showing links between PETA and the ALF, is actually run by the [Center for Consumer Freedom](https://www.activistfacts.com/about/) under their new name [CORE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Organizational_Research_and_Education).

However, PETA concludes by stating:

&gt;Contrary to myth, PETA does not want to confiscate animals who are well cared for and “set them free.” What we want is for the population of dogs and cats to be reduced through spaying and neutering and for people to adopt animals (preferably two so that they can keep each other company when their human companions aren’t home) from pounds or animal shelters—never from pet shops or breeders—thereby reducing suffering in the world.

PETA is not a particularly large animal protection organization, HSUS is the largest organization in the United States working to protect animals, and Mercy For Animals, The Humane League, Animal Equality, and HSUS are considered to be doing the most impactful work. However, PETA is the most well known among people who aren't particularly familiar with the topic, partly because PETA focuses on getting attention, and partly because the animal agriculture lobby has targeted them.

PETA does do some good work. They offer spay and neuter programs. They provide more humane methods of euthanasia to animals that would otherwise be killed using more cruel techniques. They have exposed many extreme cases of animal abuse and succeeded in getting legislative changes and criminal prosecutions as a result. That said, they also do not focus on spending their resources effectively to the same extent that other groups do, and their focus on getting inciteful media exposure often leads to them belittling other serious issues in a way that is deserving of criticism.

Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

&gt;A century ago there were probably more than 230,000 orangutans in total, but the Bornean orangutan is now estimated to number about 45,000-69,000 (Endangered) and the Sumatran about 7,500 (Critically Endangered). 

[Source](http://www.worldwildlife.org/species/orangutan). 

According to Wikipedia the world produced 48 million tonnes of palm oil in 2008. This amounts to roughly 432,000,000,000,000 (432 trillion) calories. Assuming that orangutans were killed at the same pace in 2008 as they had been for the rest of the past century that would be (230,000-45,000)/100 = 1,850 orangutans killed that year.

Even if 100% of the decline in the orangutan population was due to palm oil, this amounts to 0.000004 orangutans killed per million calories. Compare that to the 1.65 animals estimated to be killed per million calories of grains produced, 1.73 per million calories of fruits, and 2.65 per million calories of vegetables, and 251 animals per million calories of chicken.

The routine use of low doses of antibiotics on factory farms to promote growth creates prime conditions for the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria, which pose one of the largest threats to human health. [80 percent of the antibiotics sold in the United States are used in meat and poultry production](http://consumersunion.org/news/the-overuse-of-antibiotics-in-food-animals-threatens-public-health-2/), and it is estimated that antimicrobial resistance [will cost 300 million lives and up to $100 trillion from the global economy by 2050](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/antibiotic-resistance-will-kill-300-million-people-by-2050/).

Raising cattle for food requires far more land than growing plant-based foods directly for consumption. It also is a substantial contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, [a bigger share than all of transportation according to the UN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock%27s_Long_Shadow). However, those aren't the only areas of serious concern. The UN has also stated:

&gt;The livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global. The findings of this report suggest that it should be a major policy focus when dealing with problems of land degradation, climate change and air pollution, water shortage and water pollution and loss of biodiversity.

&gt;Livestock's contribution to environmental problems is on a massive scale and its potential contribution to their solution is equally large. The impact is so significant that it needs to be addressed with urgency. Major reductions in impact could be achieved at reasonable cost.

It struck me as difficult to follow and seemed somewhat agressive and intending to get under people's skin. I thought the response of ""k"" was reasonable. 

OP then acted in a way that I feel violated any reasonable polite decorum with the response of ""fuck you assholes"" as if the response of ""k"" was some sort of terrible attack and as if it somehow reflected on more persons than the individual who posted it.

The subsequent response offering a hug could potentially be seen as condescending, but appropriate given the over the top attack that had just transpired, but that pales in comparison to the complete vitriol and blame that follows. 

While I am trying my best to see OP's point of view here, the only inappropriate behavior I can identify is coming from them. I hope they get the assistance that they need to deal with the feelings of self-harm they are experiencing.

Fish-eaters and vegetarians had similar, intermediate mean BMI. Differences in lifestyle factors including smoking, physical activity and education level accounted for less than 5% of the difference in mean age-adjusted BMI between meat-eaters and vegans, whereas differences in macronutrient intake accounted for about half of the difference. High protein (as percent energy) and low fibre intakes were the dietary factors most strongly and consistently associated with increasing BMI both between and within the diet groups.

In multivariate, adjusted logistic regression analyses, self-identified vegans had a significantly lower risk of overweight or obesity [odds ratio (OR) = 0.35; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.69] than did omnivores, as did lactovegetarians (OR = 0.54; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.85) and semivegetarians (OR = 0.52; 95% CI: 0.43, 0.62).

With warm weather and water-logged soil, rice paddies act like wetlands, but are generated by humans for the purpose of food production. Due to the swamp-like environment of rice fields, this crop alone is responsible for approximately 50-100 million metric tons of methane emission each year. This means that rice agriculture is responsible for approximately 15 to 20 percent of anthropogenic methane emissions. An article written by William F. Ruddiman explores the possibility that methane emissions started to rise as a result of anthropogenic activity 5000 years ago when ancient cultures started to settle and use agriculture, rice irrigation in particular, as a primary food source.

Consuming animal products causes a great deal of harm and suffering to other individuals, and accordingly something as menial as a taste preference (especially when there are so many other delicious foods available) comes nowhere close to being a sufficient justification.

The routine use of low doses of antibiotics on factory farms to promote growth creates prime conditions for the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria, which pose one of the largest threats to human health. [80 percent of the antibiotics sold in the United States are used in meat and poultry production](http://consumersunion.org/news/the-overuse-of-antibiotics-in-food-animals-threatens-public-health-2/), and it is estimated that antimicrobial resistance [will cost 300 million lives and up to $100 trillion from the global economy by 2050](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/antibiotic-resistance-will-kill-300-million-people-by-2050/).

Raising cattle for food requires far more land than growing plant-based foods directly for consumption. It also is a substantial contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, [a bigger share than all of transportation according to the UN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock%27s_Long_Shadow). However, those aren't the only areas of serious concern. The UN has also stated:

&gt;The livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global. The findings of this report suggest that it should be a major policy focus when dealing with problems of land degradation, climate change and air pollution, water shortage and water pollution and loss of biodiversity.

&gt;Livestock's contribution to environmental problems is on a massive scale and its potential contribution to their solution is equally large. The impact is so significant that it needs to be addressed with urgency. Major reductions in impact could be achieved at reasonable cost.

251,"&gt;Veganism is the platform for defending the untamed. That’s what the vegan ethic is ultimately all about.

No. Veganism is about minimizing the amount of exploitation and cruelty that is inflicted upon animals. If we can do that by interfering in nature then we should.

While I agree that we shouldn’t have programs to shoot deer or predators, I think the reasoning behind why in this article is terrible. It picks at a few obvious failures and uses scare mongering tactics about pharmaceutical companies to support a misguided idea that we cannot successfully and effectively intervene in nature to reduce suffering, and it paints a false picture of nature as a paradise without human intervention. 

Nature is rightly described as being red in tooth and claw. Without human intervention we still see populations rise drastically and then plummet from starvation or over predation from year to year. Humans could intervene in small ways (such as maintaining a fairly consistent level of plant growth instead of allowing heavy rains or droughts to take their toll) that would lessen some of these spikes and crashes. 

Disease is also a major issue in nature. Humans could act quickly to quarantine populations if new diseases are spotted early to prevent a virulent and painful disease from spreading.

276,"You don't get to choose just to exclude certain groups from those who get consideration. If someone chose to abuse certain groups of humans, you would speak up regardless of whether or not they declared that those groups did not matter. However, there are substantial ways in which consuming animal products harms humans as well:

The routine use of low doses of antibiotics on factory farms to promote growth creates prime conditions for the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria, which pose one of the largest threats to human health. [80 percent of the antibiotics sold in the United States are used in meat and poultry production](http://consumersunion.org/news/the-overuse-of-antibiotics-in-food-animals-threatens-public-health-2/), and it is estimated that antimicrobial resistance [will cost 300 million lives and up to $100 trillion from the global economy by 2050](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/antibiotic-resistance-will-kill-300-million-people-by-2050/).

The World Bank estimates that [91% of the land deforested in the Amazon since 1970 has been cleared for grazing](http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/02/02/000090341_20040202130625/Rendered/PDF/277150PAPER0wbwp0no1022.pdf). Raising cattle for food requires far more land than growing plant-based foods directly for consumption. It also is a substantial contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, [a bigger share than all of transportation according to the UN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock%27s_Long_Shadow). However, those aren't the only areas of serious concern. The UN has also stated:

&gt;The livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global. The findings of this report suggest that it should be a major policy focus when dealing with problems of land degradation, climate change and air pollution, water shortage and water pollution and loss of biodiversity.

&gt;Livestock's contribution to environmental problems is on a massive scale and its potential contribution to their solution is equally large. The impact is so significant that it needs to be addressed with urgency. Major reductions in impact could be achieved at reasonable cost.

* 1/2 tsp white pepper

**Easy Chipotle Cream**

* 1/2 cup soaked cashews
* 3/4 cup salsa
* 1/4 tsp chili powder
* 1/4 tsp sea salt

###Instructions

1. Soak cashews for two hours or overnight for the cashew mozzarella and chipotle cream. You can also boil them for ten minutes to soften. Drain the cashews. In a high-powered blender or food processor, add 1/2 cup soaked cashews and the remaining ingredients until the white pepper. Blend on high speed for 2 minutes until smooth. 
2. Pour the cashew mixture in a saucepan over medium high heat. Cook for 5 minutes until the cheese forms into a gooey ball in the center. Stir constantly to prevent sticking. The cheese will stay fairly soft. 
3. To make a large vegan quesadilla, spread 1/4 cup of cashew mozzarella onto one tortilla. Spread 2 tablespoons of cashew cream onto another tortilla. Combine the tortillas. In a skillet over medium heat, cook the Vegan Quesadilla on 30-45 seconds on each side until the tortillas are crispy and the cheese is melty. Cut into triangles and serve with extra chipotle cream and avocado!

**Easy Chipotle Cream**

1. Add all ingredients to a high speed blender and blend on high for 2-3 minutes until smooth. Chipotle Cream will keep in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days.

It is pretty clear that Direct Action Everywhere has exaggerated the extent to which their tactics can be backed up by evidence. Yes, we do see that direct action increases in successful movements, but we also see that nearly all types of interventions are more likely to be found in successful movements. We’re never going to find a perfect example from a past movement that perfectly matches up with the situation we find ourselves in today.

There is still some strong evidence on what tactics are effective for persuasion. There are plenty of studies that have been conducted that choose a particular intervention and test it on a random sample of people, and then compare them with a control group that has not received the intervention. A great deal of this research has been conducted by groups interested in advertising, but it is also being conducted by the animal rights movement through groups like Faunalytics, Animal Charity Evaluators, Humane League Labs, Mercy For Animals, and the Reducitarian Foundation. Some good books that discuss the bulk of this research are Nick Cooney’s “Change of Heart” and “Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion” by Robert Cialdini.

Direct Action Everywhere rightly gets criticized for a few of their actions that create a large amount of backlash and seem unlikely to persuade many people, but I want to add that I see an even larger amount of work that they do that I think does have a positive impact. Direct Action Everywhere does a superb job of building vegan community and getting people involved in activism. They host a lot of events and protests that do seem to be quite effective.

1. In a large pot, bring salted water to a boil. Cook fettuccine as directed on the package. Drain and reserve ½ cup of the pasta water. Set drained pasta aside. 
2. In a large pan, heat olive oil until shimmering over medium high heat. Add the mushrooms and salt. Cook until mushrooms are tender, about 5-6 minutes. Add the shallot and thyme and cook until softened, about 2-3 minutes. Add the sherry and scraped any browned bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to deglaze the pan. Cook until most of the liquid has evaporated. 
3. Add the reserved cooked fettuccine and ¼ cup of the pasta water. Toss until warm. Remove from the heat. Fold in the Just Mayo Truffle until fully combined. If the sauce needs to be thinned, add additional pasta water by the teaspoon until the alfredo sauce coats the fettucine.
4. Garnish with parsley and serve immediately.

* 8 ounces fettuccine
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 12 ounces cremini mushrooms, thinly sliced
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 2 shallots, diced
* 2 teaspoons chopped thyme leaves
* 3 tablespoons dry sherry 
* ¼ cup Just Mayo Truffle
* 2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley (garnish)

**Directions**

1. In a large pot, bring salted water to a boil. Cook fettuccine as directed on the package. Drain and reserve ½ cup of the pasta water. Set drained pasta aside. 
2. In a large pan, heat olive oil until shimmering over medium high heat. Add the mushrooms and salt. Cook until mushrooms are tender, about 5-6 minutes. Add the shallot and thyme and cook until softened, about 2-3 minutes. Add the sherry and scraped any browned bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to deglaze the pan. Cook until most of the liquid has evaporated. 
3. Add the reserved cooked fettuccine and ¼ cup of the pasta water. Toss until warm. Remove from the heat. Fold in the Just Mayo Truffle until fully combined. If the sauce needs to be thinned, add additional pasta water by the teaspoon until the alfredo sauce coats the fettucine.
4. Garnish with parsley and serve immediately.

Additionally, The World Bank estimates that [91% of the land deforested in the Amazon since 1970 has been cleared for grazing](http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/02/02/000090341_20040202130625/Rendered/PDF/277150PAPER0wbwp0no1022.pdf). However, those aren't the only areas of serious concern. The UN has also stated:

&gt;The livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global. The findings of this report suggest that it should be a major policy focus when dealing with problems of land degradation, climate change and air pollution, water shortage and water pollution and loss of biodiversity.

&gt;Livestock's contribution to environmental problems is on a massive scale and its potential contribution to their solution is equally large. The impact is so significant that it needs to be addressed with urgency. Major reductions in impact could be achieved at reasonable cost.

Additionally, the routine use of low doses of antibiotics on factory farms to promote growth creates prime conditions for the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria, which pose one of the largest threats to human health. [80 percent of the antibiotics sold in the United States are used in meat and poultry production](http://consumersunion.org/news/the-overuse-of-antibiotics-in-food-animals-threatens-public-health-2/), and it is estimated that antimicrobial resistance [will cost 300 million lives and up to $100 trillion from the global economy by 2050](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/antibiotic-resistance-will-kill-300-million-people-by-2050/).

Finally, we all know that animal agriculture is incredibly cruel to animals and a substantial proportion of Americans consume far more meat than is considered healthy. For all these reasons, many people are interested in finding alternatives to conventional meat products, and Impossible Foods is looking to create products that are an easy and appealing choice for these consumers.",2016-10-13 18:36:41+00:00,d8qlty4,3.0,t1_d8qk2ij,2140.0,sanfrancisco

367,"&gt;Andrew Jeremy Wakefield (born c. 1957) is a British former gastroenterologist and medical researcher, known for his fraudulent 1998 research paper in support of the now-discredited claim that there was a link between the administration of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, and the appearance ofautism and bowel disease. 

&gt;After the publication of the paper, other researchers were unable to reproduce Wakefield's findings or confirm his hypothesis of an association between the MMR vaccine and autism, or autism and gastrointestinal disease. A 2004 investigation by Sunday Times reporter Brian Deer identified undisclosed financial conflicts of interest on Wakefield's part, and most of his co-authors then withdrew their support for the study's interpretations. The British General Medical Council (GMC) conducted an inquiry into allegations of misconduct against Wakefield and two former colleagues. The investigation centred on Deer's numerous findings, including that children with autism were subjected to unnecessary invasive medical procedures such as colonoscopies and lumbar punctures, and that Wakefield acted without the required ethical approval from an institutional review board.

&gt;On 28 January 2010, a five-member statutory tribunal of the GMC found three dozen charges proved, including four counts of dishonesty and 12 counts involving the abuse of developmentally challenged children. The panel ruled that Wakefield had ""failed in his duties as a responsible consultant"", acted both against the interests of his patients, and ""dishonestly and irresponsibly"" in his published research. The Lancet fully retracted the 1998 publication on the basis of the GMC's findings, noting that elements of the manuscript had been falsified. The Lancet's editor-in-chief Richard Horton said the paper was ""utterly false"" and that the journal had been ""deceived"". Three months following The Lancet's retraction, Wakefield was struck off the UK medical register, with a statement identifying deliberate falsification in the research published in The Lancet, and was barred from practising medicine in the UK. 

&gt;In January 2011, an editorial accompanying an article by Brian Deer in BMJ identified Wakefield's work as an ""elaborate fraud"". In a follow-up article, Deer said that Wakefield had planned to launch a venture on the back of an MMR vaccination scare that would profit from new medical tests and ""litigation driven testing"". In November 2011, yet another report in BMJ revealed original raw data indicating that, contrary to Wakefield's claims in The Lancet, children in his research did not have inflammatory bowel disease.

PETA does run a program to offer the most humane method of euthanasia in areas that would not otherwise be able to afford it. Nobody who is informed on the subject thinks it is anything other than offering more humane methods of euthanasia. They also offer many spay and neuter programs. PETA's offices are also all animal friendly and they encourage their employees to bring their companion animals in to work. There is a single case where a single PETA employee mistakenly took an untagged, uncollared dog that was part of someone's family in a community where they had been asked to come to help deal with the problem of excessive stray animals.

&gt; It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

&gt; A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

&gt; With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

&gt; A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range. 

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

&gt;Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/tips-vegetarians)**

&gt; Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12. 

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/guidelines-publications/n55)**

&gt; Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

&gt; A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them. 

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

**[Harvard Medical School](http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/becoming-a-vegetarian)**

&gt; Traditionally, research into vegetarianism focused mainly on potential nutritional deficiencies, but in recent years, the pendulum has swung the other way, and studies are confirming the health benefits of meat-free eating.

&gt;Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/tips-vegetarians)**

&gt; Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12. 

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/guidelines-publications/n55)**

&gt; Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

* 1 teaspoon ginger, minced
* 1 teaspoon garlic, minced
* 1 ½ tablespoons curry powder
* 1 bay leaf
* 1 tomato, diced
* 2 teaspoon Serrano pepper, chopped, divided
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* 1 russet potato, peeled, cubed and boiled until soft

* 1 teaspoon toasted ground cumin
* 1 bunch mint, leaves only
* 1 cup Just Mayo
* ½ cup chopped cilantro
* Optional garnishes: pickled cabbage, pickled onions, spicy tamari

**Directions**

1. To make the roti dough, whisk together the flours, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon oil, and 5 tablespoons water until the dough starts to form. Then knead the dough until soft and smooth. Transfer the dough to a bowl, cover and let rest for at least 30 minutes. 
2. Meanwhile make the Aloo Chana by heating 1 teaspoon oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add the ginger and garlic and cook until translucent and fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in the curry powder and bay leaf; and continue to cook for 2 minutes on medium low heat. Add the tomato, 1 teaspoon Serrano, and tomato paste. Allow to cook for 3-4 minutes on low heat until the tomatoes begin to break down. Stir in the cooked potatoes and allow to cook for a minute, then add the chickpeas. Add ¼ cup water and simmer uncovered until the liquid has nearly evaporated. Add half of the lemon juice, ½ teaspoon of salt and toasted cumin. Remove from heat and set aside, covered.
3. To make the mint sauce, combine mint leaves, Just Mayo, the remaining lemon juice and 1 teaspoon Serrano in a food processor or blender. Pulse until combined. 
4. To finish the roti, cut the dough into 4 equal pieces. On a lightly floured surface, roll out each piece of dough to form 4 8-inch rounds. Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium high heat until hot. Add ½ teaspoon of oil until shimmering. Add one roti and cook on one side until it starts bubbling. Flip it and allow to cook for 1 minute on the other side. Repeat until all 4 roti are cooked, adding ½ teaspoon oil for each roti if needed.
5. To assemble the Aloo Chana Roti Roll, generously spread the mint sauce on each roti, about 1 tablespoon per roti. Place about ¾ cup of the aloo chana on each roti. Top with chopped cilantro, ¼ cup pickled cabbage, 1 tablespoon pickled onion, and 1 teaspoon of spicy tamari. Roll tightly and cut in half. Serve with mint sauce on the side.

* 4 medium gold potatoes (about 1 pound)
* 1 package Tofurky® Pepperoni Slices, cut in half
* ¼ cup preferred vegetable oil, plus more for greasing foil
* 1 tablespoon dried oregano
* 2 teaspoons red pepper flakes
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* 1 teaspoon sea salt
* 4 ounces vegan mozzarella shreds


**Directions**

1. Cut a small, lengthwise slice off one side of each potato to allow them to lay flat. Working with one potato at a time, place a wooden chopstick or skewer on either side of the potato and slice crosswise in very thin slices. The chopsticks will prevent cutting all the way through. Repeat with remaining potatoes and place each on a lightly oiled square of foil.

2. Stuff pepperoni slices into some of the cuts in the potatoes.

3. In a small bowl, stir together oil, oregano, pepper flakes, garlic, and salt, and drizzle over potatoes. Sprinkle with mozzarella and tightly wrap potatoes in foil.

4. Place foil packets in campfire coals (or an oven preheated to 425˚F), and roast until tender and browned, about 40-50 minutes.

**Ethics**

We know that other animals are individuals who care about their lives and how they are treated. While even free range and organic farms you can see that [conditions are still incredibly cruel](http://imgur.com/a/fp7C0) (those are examples of typical egg-laying operations in the US), but even if there was a magical farm that allowed their animals to roam-free, these animals are nearly always still tossed onto the same trucks and shipped to the same slaughterhouses as factory farmed animals. There is the case of the former pig-farmer Bob Comis, who raised his pigs using techniques that he felt were as humane as possible, and sought out a special slaughterhouse to send them to where they could be treated with the utmost care. Even then he still writes about the intense trauma the pigs would experience in what he called [the last pig problem](https://www.thedodo.com/community/bobcomis/the-last-pig-459345722.html). Bob, a former pig farmer, recognized that there was no ethical way he could raise and slaughter pigs, and has since released his last animals to a sanctuary and transitioned to growing crops.

It may come one day to be recognized, that the number of the legs, the villosity of the skin, or the termination of the os sacrum, are reasons equally insufficient for abandoning a sensitive being to the same fate. What else is it that should trace the insuperable line? Is it the faculty of reason, or, perhaps, the faculty of discourse? But a full-grown horse or dog is beyond comparison a more rational, as well as a more conversable animal, than an infant of a day, or a week, or even a month, old. But suppose the case were otherwise, what would it avail? the question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?

&gt;The livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global. The findings of this report suggest that it should be a major policy focus when dealing with problems of land degradation, climate change and air pollution, water shortage and water pollution and loss of biodiversity.

&gt;Livestock's contribution to environmental problems is on a massive scale and its potential contribution to their solution is equally large. The impact is so significant that it needs to be addressed with urgency. Major reductions in impact could be achieved at reasonable cost.

There are also very few restrictions on how the chicks can be culled. Wikipedia has an article on [chick culling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick_culling) that discusses the most common techniques:

* Maceration, using a large high-speed grinder into which the live chicks are fed.
* Gases or gas mixtures, often carbon dioxide is used to induce unconsciousness and then death.
* Cervical dislocation (breaking the neck)
* Electrocution, a new method that has been touted as being cheap, reliable, and humane by its developers
* Suffocation in plastic bags

I also live right on the Pacific, and even here farmed fish are much more common than you would realize. However, when it comes to non-farmed fish there are still serious areas for concern. The method by which these animals are killed is by being dragged up out of the ocean and left to slowly suffocate. Furthermore, we are pulling fish out of the ocean at a rate that is far faster than sustainable. It is projected that [the oceans will be empty of fish by 2048](http://russgeorge.net/2013/05/10/fish-to-disappear-by-2050/) if the current pace of overfishing continues.

&gt;The livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global. The findings of this report suggest that it should be a major policy focus when dealing with problems of land degradation, climate change and air pollution, water shortage and water pollution and loss of biodiversity.

&gt;Livestock's contribution to environmental problems is on a massive scale and its potential contribution to their solution is equally large. The impact is so significant that it needs to be addressed with urgency. Major reductions in impact could be achieved at reasonable cost.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

&gt;Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/tips-vegetarians)**

&gt; Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12. 

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/guidelines-publications/n55)**

&gt; Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

&gt; A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

&gt; Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits.

**[Harvard Medical School](http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/becoming-a-vegetarian)**

&gt; Traditionally, research into vegetarianism focused mainly on potential nutritional deficiencies, but in recent years, the pendulum has swung the other way, and studies are confirming the health benefits of meat-free eating.

664,"I gave the numbers for other vegan crops and the number of orangutans being harmed for palm oil production would not even be a blip on a graph next to the number of animals killed to produce vegan foods. The way orangutans are killed (largely by habitat destruction) is how many animals are killed for other crops, and given that palm oil is a very efficient crop in terms of calories produced per acre, it would lead to fewer deaths due to habitat destruction. Additionally, the animals killed during the harvest of other crops do not suffer light deaths by any means.

By being vegan we **greatly** reduce the amount of suffering and death that we contribute to, but we cannot pretend that it is absolutely zero.

I am disagreeing with you because (going off of the reasons you provided for abstaining from palm oil) the evidence does not support that there is any benefit for animals by swapping palm oil for other vegan sources of calories, and the other sources could potentially be worse.",2016-09-04 20:23:55+00:00,d79gyyp,3.0,t1_d79c75k,7740.0,vegan

666,"&gt;A century ago there were probably more than 230,000 orangutans in total, but the Bornean orangutan is now estimated to number about 45,000-69,000 (Endangered) and the Sumatran about 7,500 (Critically Endangered). 

[Source](http://www.worldwildlife.org/species/orangutan). 

Even if 100% of the decline in the orangutan population was due to palm oil, this would be minuscule compared to the number of animals killed by other forms of agriculture. 

According to Wikipedia the world produced 48 million tonnes of palm oil in 2008. This amounts to roughly 432,000,000,000,000 (432 trillion) calories. Assuming that orangutans were killed at the same pace in 2008 as they had been for the rest of the past century that would be (230,000-45,000)/100 = 1,850 orangutans killed that year.

This amounts to 0.000004 orangutans killed per million calories. Compare that to the 1.65 animals estimated to be killed per million calories of grains produced, 1.73 per million calories of fruits, and 2.65 per million calories of vegetables, and 251 animals per million calories of chicken.

It may come one day to be recognized, that the number of the legs, the villosity of the skin, or the termination of the os sacrum, are reasons equally insufficient for abandoning a sensitive being to the same fate. What else is it that should trace the insuperable line? Is it the faculty of reason, or, perhaps, the faculty of discourse?

717,"#Why

**Public Health**

The routine use of low doses of antibiotics on factory farms to promote growth creates prime conditions for the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria, which pose one of the largest threats to human health. [80 percent of the antibiotics sold in the United States are used in meat and poultry production](http://consumersunion.org/news/the-overuse-of-antibiotics-in-food-animals-threatens-public-health-2/), and it is estimated that antimicrobial resistance [will cost 300 million lives and up to $100 trillion from the global economy by 2050](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/antibiotic-resistance-will-kill-300-million-people-by-2050/).

**Environment**

The World Bank estimates that [91% of the land deforested in the Amazon since 1970 has been cleared for grazing](http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/02/02/000090341_20040202130625/Rendered/PDF/277150PAPER0wbwp0no1022.pdf). Raising cattle for food requires far more land than growing plant-based foods directly for consumption. It also is a substantial contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, [a bigger share than all of transportation according to the UN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock%27s_Long_Shadow). However, those aren't the only areas of serious concern. The UN has also stated:

&gt;The livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global. The findings of this report suggest that it should be a major policy focus when dealing with problems of land degradation, climate change and air pollution, water shortage and water pollution and loss of biodiversity.

&gt;Livestock's contribution to environmental problems is on a massive scale and its potential contribution to their solution is equally large. The impact is so significant that it needs to be addressed with urgency. Major reductions in impact could be achieved at reasonable cost.

[Source](ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/010/a0701e/a0701e00.pdf)

**Ethics**

On top of all this we know that modern farm conditions are incredibly cruel, and other animals [like Dudley and Destiny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XmIkyif99s) are individuals who care about their lives and how they are treated. Beyond all the harm the choice to consume animal products causes to humans, it undoubtedly causes a great deal more harm and suffering to non-human animals.

763,"There are millions of families in the United States (and elsewhere around the world) being impacted by alcoholism and drug addiction. Tens of thousands of lives are lost prematurely, not just due to overdose, but also due to things like driving while intoxicated or drug-associated crimes. Alcohol and other recreational drugs have a significant negative impact on people’s health as well. 

The people doing these things do not intend to harm their families or those around them. These substances interfere with people’s ability to act rationally and responsibly. People who are otherwise kind and compassionate end up putting the people who love them through hell, and harming those around them because these substances interfere with users’ ability to make appropriate decisions in these areas of their lives.

I know that people are going to say that they can drink or use drugs responsibly. They are not addicts. However, no one intends to let their drug use negatively impact their life. Nearly everyone who begins using believes that they are doing so responsibly and they have incredible difficulty admitting the harm they have caused to themselves and those around them. 

I stay away from recreational drugs including alcohol because the expected harm that comes from using these substances exceeds the expected benefits that they offer. This is a completely separate issue from animal rights, a smaller issue, and one that I discuss less frequently, but a choice that I feel is the right one to make nonetheless.

&gt;Especially since turning vegan, I love a drink now more than ever, it's the only time I can forget what I've seen, and the only time I can escape from knowing what I know about the treatment of all those animals.

765,"&gt;Animals eat other animals. We are animals, so we eat other animals. I don't find the act itself to be morally questionable at all. We are all made up of the same stuff, and we're heading to the same place, but consciousness is the difference to me. It is a spectrum, and I wouldn't eat something of a comparable or higher level of consciousness.

You shouldn’t look to how other animals treat each other and decide that makes it okay for you to harm animals too. Many other humans still act in ways that are harmful to one another too. You’ve learned from a young age that just because someone else does something doesn’t mean that it is okay for you to do that thing too.

You're right that consciousness, or something similar such as the ability to care about how oneself is treated, is an important quality when it comes to ethics. The scientific community has expressed their consensus on the subject in the [Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_consciousness#Cambridge_Declaration_on_Consciousness) where they stated unequivocally that “the weight of evidence indicates that humans are not unique in possessing the neurological substrates that generate consciousness. Non-human animals, including all mammals and birds, and many other creatures, including octopuses, also possess these neurological substrates.”

&gt;Someone said something like ""in the future eating animals is going to be regarded the same way as racism, sexism, etc, towards other people."" Not likely, but if the pigs fight back and get the vote I'll stop eating them.

Pigs do fight when they are mistreated and when their lives are being threatened. However, this shouldn’t matter. Might does not make right. We should treat other beings respectfully, regardless of whether they have the strength to usurp rights themselves.

&gt;I'm interested in the survival of our species, first and foremost, but I do recognize the problems of factory farming. It's evident that many of our practices are unsustainable, and might lead to economic problems and subsequent loss of life. I seek ways to avoid contributing to the big companies.

There are many ways in which animal agriculture poses substantial threats to humans, and has the potential to threaten, or greatly reduce the quality of, life for huge numbers of individuals, but once again this is little different from those who claimed that members of their own race, gender, religion, nationality, or tribe should always come first.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/guidelines-publications/n55)**

&gt; Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

&gt; A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

&gt; Traditionally, research into vegetarianism focused mainly on potential nutritional deficiencies, but in recent years, the pendulum has swung the other way, and studies are confirming the health benefits of meat-free eating. Nowadays, plant-based eating is recognized as not only nutritionally sufficient but also as a way to reduce the risk for many chronic illnesses.",2016-08-18 17:22:42+00:00,d6muktm,3.0,t1_d6mtrj0,967.0,TMBR

801,"While it is true that those who live in extreme poverty are often nearly vegan out of necessity, there were also many prominent vegans of the 19th century:

&gt;Vegetarianism established itself as a significant movement in 19th-century England and the United States. There were ovo-lacto vegetarians, who avoided meat but ate eggs and dairy; pescetarians, who in addition ate fish; and dietary vegans, then called strict vegetarians, who ate no meat, nor animal related products. In 1813 the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley published A Vindication of Natural Diet, advocating ""abstinence from animal food and spirituous liquors,"" and in 1815 William Lambe, a London physician, claimed that a vegan diet could cure a range of diseases from cancer and tuberculosis to acne. Sylvester Graham's meatless Graham diet – mostly fruit, vegetables, water, and bread made at home with stoneground flour – became popular as a supposed health remedy in the 1830s in the United States.

&gt;Several vegan communities were established. Amos Bronson Alcott, father of novelist Louisa May Alcott, opened the Temple School in 1834 and Fruitlands in 1844 in Massachusetts. In England in 1838 James Pierrepont Greaves founded the Concordium, a vegan community at Alcott House on Ham Common. In 1843 members of Alcott House created the British and Foreign Society for the Promotion of Humanity and Abstinence from Animal Food, led by Sophia Chichester.

&gt;Alcott House helped establish the British Vegetarian Society, which held its first meeting in 1847 in Ramsgate, Kent. An article in the society's magazine in 1851 discussing alternatives to shoe leather suggests the presence of vegans within the membership who rejected animal use entirely.

**Directions**

1. Preheat oven to 400F degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, and set aside.

3. Bake squash for 8-10 minutes. Allow squash to cool slightly. Turn the squash over with hollow side up on baking sheet. 
4. To make the squash filling, heat 2 tablespoons oil until shimmering in a large skillet over medium-high. Add the green onion, onion and bell pepper. Cook until onions just start to soften, about 3-4 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes and ½ cup parsley and cook for 3-4 more minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly. Fold in the Just Goddess, salt, pepper and pecans until well incorporated. 
5. Spoon the squash filling into each of the hollowed out squash halves. Sprinkle Italian bread crumbs over the squash.
6. Place the baking sheet back into the oven for 8-10 minutes or until bread crumbs are golden brown.

* ¼ cup Italian bread crumbs
* Red pepper flake (optional)

**Directions**

1. Preheat oven to 400F degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, and set aside. 
2. Cut the yellow squash in half lengthwise. Carefully scoop out the seeds to hollow out the squash, leaving the flesh intact. Brush the inside and outside of the squash with two tablespoons oil and place hollow side down onto the reserved baking sheet. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt and pepper.
3. Bake squash for 8-10 minutes. Allow squash to cool slightly. Turn the squash over with hollow side up on baking sheet. 
4. To make the squash filling, heat 2 tablespoons oil until shimmering in a large skillet over medium-high. Add the green onion, onion and bell pepper. Cook until onions just start to soften, about 3-4 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes and ½ cup parsley and cook for 3-4 more minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly. Fold in the Just Goddess, salt, pepper and pecans until well incorporated. 
5. Spoon the squash filling into each of the hollowed out squash halves. Sprinkle Italian bread crumbs over the squash.
6. Place the baking sheet back into the oven for 8-10 minutes or until bread crumbs are golden brown. 
7. Garnish with red pepper flake and chopped parsley.

**For the Pot Pies**

* 1.5 cups mixed frozen or fresh veggies
* 1 package of Original Pillsbury Crescent Rolls
* 1 cup vegan gravy (recipe below)

**For the Vegan Gravy**

* 2 tbsp flour
* 2 tbsp oil
* 1 cup water
* 1 vegan bouillon cube
* 1/8 cup chopped yellow onion

###Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Line a greased cupcake tin with dough triangles as demonstrated in the video.
2. Boil the water and bouillon cube until a broth forms, then set it aside.
3. Over medium heat, pour oil and onions into a small sauce pan and cook until the onions become translucent. Lower the temperature, add flour and stir until your roux has a smooth consistency. Add broth and stir over low heat until it thickens into a delicious gravy. Set aside.
4. Spoon a small amount of frozen veggies and gravy into each dough-lined cupcake tin (careful not to over-fill) and wrap the dough to cover the top.
5. Bake for 12-14 minutes or until golden brown. This will take a little longer than the crescent roll package directions say.
6. Remove from oven and let cool for five minutes before carefully removing each pot pie from the pan with a knife or fork and serving.

840,"Yes, vegans are a diverse group that comes from all walks of life. They may tend to be slightly more progressive as a group, but I have still met plenty of vegans who identify as conservatives or Republicans.

There are many reasons why these things would resonate with conservatives. Conservatives are opposed to excessive and unnecessary government interventions into markets. However, what we have right now are huge subsidies for animal agriculture, and for the corn and soy that are the primary feed crops for this industry. There are also massive government check off programs that tax all producers of meat, dairy, and eggs to fund the promotion of their products (and, although illegal, it has been uncovered that they also have used funds to lobby other government agencies and to disparage competitors’ products). 

Additionally, many conservatives realize that promoting free market capitalism doesn’t mean allowing corporations to externalize their costs onto the rest of society. Animal agriculture is a major source of air and water pollution, and is a substantial contributor to the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria through the use of low doses of antibiotics to promote rapid growth in animals. These costs have been pushed onto society instead of being rightly paid by the parties that are responsible for creating the problem.

Finally, many conservatives see the ag-gag laws that the meat industry has pushed through several state governments as a major (and likely unconstitutional) overstep of government power. ",2016-08-12 21:28:42+00:00,d6f47jd,1.0,t3_4xfdby,6951.0,AskReddit

Vegans are simply using words to say that they shouldn't be allowed to force this harm upon others. ",2016-08-06 15:03:53+00:00,d66pl1j,2.0,t1_d66nwg1,3471.0,changemyview
948,"###Ingredients


**For mushrooms**

* 2 Teaspoons Canola oil
* ½ Pound Mushrooms of your choice, bite-sized pieces (we used maitake!)
* 2 Cloves Garlic, minced
* 1½ Teaspoon Soy sauce
* ¼ Cup Green onions, thinly sliced
* 1 Teaspoon Seasoned rice vinegar
* ½ Teaspoon Sesame oil

**For Tangy Peanut Dipping Sauce**

* ¼ Cup Creamy peanut butter
* 2 Teaspoons Soy sauce
* 2 Tablespoons Maple syrup
* 1½ Tablespoon Fresh lime juice
* ½ Teaspoon Chile garlic sauce
* 1 Clove Garlic, minced
* Hot water, to thin sauce as needed

**For assembling Summer Rolls**

* Cooked mushrooms, cooled to room temperature
* 6-8 Leaves of lettuce
* 1 English cucumber, thin 4-inch long strips
* 1-2 Carrots, thin 4-inch long strips (try different colors!)
* 1 Cup Fresh herbs of your choice, picked (cilantro, mint, Thai basil)
* 6-8 Rice paper wrappers

###Instructions

1. Gather ingredients for the mushrooms and have mise en place ready.

2. Heat skillet over medium heat and add oil. Add mushrooms and sauté until they start to release liquid. The amount of liquid will depend on which type of mushroom you choose.

3. Add garlic, soy sauce, and green onions. Continue sautéing until most of the liquid has evaporated.

4. Add rice vinegar and sesame oil. Turn off the heat and allow mushrooms to cool to room temperature.

5. This is a good time to make the Tangy Peanut Dipping Sauce. Combine all the sauce ingredients and mix well.

6. To assemble the rolls, have all mise en place ready: trim lettuce leaves, cut cucumber and carrots into thin 4-inch long pieces, and pick the herbs.

7. Prepare a shallow dish with enough warm water to soak rice paper wrappers. Place each wrapper in water for about 10 seconds so it hydrates.

8. Remove rice paper from water and lay onto your work surface to start assembling. Place lettuce in middle of wrapper. Scoop a spoonful of mushrooms and place along the center of the wrapper. Add carrots, cucumbers, and sprinkle herbs.

9. Fold the bottom third of the wrapper up over the filling. While holding it firmly in place, fold the sides towards the center. Continue by rolling the roll up tightly towards the top until it looks like the shape of a cigar.

10. Repeat steps 8-9 with the rest of the wrappers until the filling is used up.

11. If desired, cut each roll in half diagonally (or serve whole). Serve with Tangy Peanut Dipping Sauce and enjoy!

Third, the main greenhouse gas emission of concern is from cattle is not the CO2 that they produce.

&gt; It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Harvard Medical School](http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/becoming-a-vegetarian)**

&gt; Traditionally, research into vegetarianism focused mainly on potential nutritional deficiencies, but in recent years, the pendulum has swung the other way, and studies are confirming the health benefits of meat-free eating.

It is only really of any significance if someone is consuming such a limited variety of protein that the foods that are low in one amino acid are not counteracted by other foods that are higher in that same amino acid (consuming two different foods that have a PDCAAS of 0.40 can have a PDCAAS of 1.00 when consumed together).

It contains 75g of protein per 100 grams. Furthermore, why are you comparing per 100g instead of per 100 calories? Tofu would come out well ahead of meat by that metric.

She will strengthen the affordability of health care and education. She will take steps forward on animal rights and welfare issues (I have no doubt that she will sign into law any animal protection bill that is able to make it through congress, and keep in mind that two members of her immediate family have been semi-vegan). She understands the challenges of governing, and has been someone who has gotten things done in politics for decades. 

If you want a candidate with the strongest possible animal rights views, then feel free to write in /u/lnfinity in November, but if you want our actual system of government to take a step in the right direction, then I hope you'll join me in voting for Clinton and other candidates up and down the ballot who are both electable and will continue push for progress on all these important issues.",2016-07-31 18:24:57+00:00,d5ykhby,1.0,t3_4vhz3d,4275.0,vegan

1023,"&gt; And this is not about morality to me, because to me there is nothing immoral about eating animals.

The routine use of low doses of antibiotics on factory farms to promote growth creates prime conditions for the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria, which pose one of the largest threats to human health. [80 percent of the antibiotics sold in the United States are used in meat and poultry production](http://consumersunion.org/news/the-overuse-of-antibiotics-in-food-animals-threatens-public-health-2/), and it is estimated that antimicrobial resistance [will cost 300 million lives and up to $100 trillion from the global economy by 2050](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/antibiotic-resistance-will-kill-300-million-people-by-2050/).

The World Bank estimates that [91% of the land deforested in the Amazon since 1970 has been cleared for grazing](http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/02/02/000090341_20040202130625/Rendered/PDF/277150PAPER0wbwp0no1022.pdf). Raising cattle for food requires far more land than growing plant-based foods directly for consumption. It also is a substantial contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, [a bigger share than all of transportation according to the UN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock%27s_Long_Shadow). However, those aren't the only areas of serious concern. The UN has also stated:

&gt;The livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global. The findings of this report suggest that it should be a major policy focus when dealing with problems of land degradation, climate change and air pollution, water shortage and water pollution and loss of biodiversity.

&gt;Livestock's contribution to environmental problems is on a massive scale and its potential contribution to their solution is equally large. The impact is so significant that it needs to be addressed with urgency. Major reductions in impact could be achieved at reasonable cost.

The panel was friendly, but heated. Both panelists are brilliant speakers and debaters who search for points of agreement, but also had points of contention. Wayne argued that DXE’s tactics brought Whole Foods to the discussion table with animal rights groups, while Bruce argued that Whole Foods CEO, John Mackey is an ethical vegan who cares passionately about animal rights issues, and he has continued to work with animal rights groups to take the steps forward that he can for his company in spite of the aggressive tactics of DXE. Wayne argued that corporations are ultimately beholden to maximizing profit for their shareholders and cannot be expected to take any steps that are not consumer driven, while Bruce acknowledged the importance of consumers but also emphasized that corporations are made up of people, many of whom like John Mackey do care about having a positive influence, and they have more leeway than Wayne had let on to implement changes that benefit the company’s image or long term goals.

At the end they both were asked to mention something positive that the other one was doing and something that they wish the other would improve upon. Wayne invited Bruce to throw him under the bus as an extremist when asking companies to work with him, but also wanted Bruce to work with Wayne on the sidelines. Bruce acknowledged that Wayne had done a great job of rallying activists, but hoped that he would go after companies that are the worst animal abusers instead of fighting against those that are already taking positive steps.

I went in siding with Bruce Friedrich on the issue, and I left with my position unswayed, but it was a very informative talk that I haven’t done justice to in these short paragraphs.

* 1 L vegetable broth
* 4 L water
* 1 tsp olive oil
* 16 baby bok choy, chopped
* 1 can sliced water chestnuts, drained
* 1 medium yellow onion, sliced into eighths
* 100 g dry shiitakes, whole or 12 fresh shiitakes sliced in half
* 6 gloves garlic, minced
* 32 points star anise, whole (or 5 grams)
* 1 tsp cinnamon, ground
* 80 g fresh ginger, sliced
* 328 g firm tofu, cubed (this is a stand package of tofu, about ¾ lbs)
* 4 fresh green onions, finely sliced
* 332 g dry sweet potato noodles (about ¾ lbs)
* soy sauce and Sriracha sauce to taste

**Instructions**

1. In a large soup pot, bring 2L water and broth to a boil. In a separate pot for the noodles, add remaining 2L water and bring to boil.
2. While the water and broth are heating up, heat a large pan over medium heat. Add the oil, star anise, cinnamon, ginger and garlic and heat until you can smell the aromas, about 2-3 minutes and then add to the large soup pot with the boiling water and broth.
3. If you are using dry shiitakes, add them to the boiling broth now and cook over medium heat for 10-15 minutes. Depending on how hard your shiitakes are, this might take a little longer - the mushrooms should be just about soft enough to eat. If you are using fresh shiitakes, you can add them now too, but only boil for 5 minutes.
4. While the shiitakes are cooking, add the dry noodles to the smaller pot and cook for about 10-15 minutes, until al dente. You can follow the instructions on the package for this. Once they are cooked, drain, rinse in cold water, and set aside.
5. Add the tofu, onions, water chestnuts and bok choy to the soup and cook until bok choy is bright green, about 5 minutes, then take the pot off the stove.
6. In a large soup bowl, add about ¼ of noodles and top with soup bowl is full. Garnish with green onions, GF soy sauce and Sriracha sauce.

* 1 white or yellow onion, diced (110 g)
* 1 red pepper, diced (119 g)
* 1/2 tsp each sea salt and black pepper, divided (plus more to taste)
* 1 jalapeño, diced with seeds
* 4 cloves garlic (2 Tbsp or 12 g)

* 3/4 cup (148g) dry red lentils, thoroughly rinsed in cold water + drained
* 1 15-ounce (425 g) can kidney beans, slightly drained
* 1 15-ounce (425 g) can black beans, slightly drained
* 1-2 Tbsp (12-24 g) coconut sugar (or maple syrup)
* optional: 1 15-ounce (425 g) can corn, drained

**For Serving - Optional**

* Fresh chopped cilantro
* Avocado

**Instructions**

1. Heat a large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add oil, onion, and red pepper. Season with a healthy pinch each salt and pepper and stir. Sauté for 3-4 minutes, stirring frequently.
2. Add jalapeño and garlic to a mortar and pestle and crush into a rough paste (alternatively, blend in a small food processor, or finely mince). Add to the pot with onion and red pepper, and season with another pinch salt and pepper.
3. Add 2 Tbsp chili powder, 1 Tbsp cumin, paprika, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, and water, and stir to combine. Bring to a low boil over medium high heat.
4. Once boiling, add lentils and reduce heat to medium-low or low, so it's at a gentle simmer. You want to see bubbles, but you don't want it boiling. Cook for 15 minutes, or until lentils are mostly tender. As it's cooking you may need to add more water if the mixture is looking too dry and the lentils aren't submerged (I didn't find that necessary).
5. Next add kidney beans, black beans, 1/4 tsp each salt and pepper, and remaining 1 Tbsp cumin, and 1 Tbsp chili powder, and stir to combine.
6. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then reduce heat slightly to low (or medium-low), add corn (optional), cover, and gently simmer for 20 minutes to meld the flavors together. Stir occasionally.
7. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more chili powder or cumin for smokiness, salt for saltiness, or a little coconut sugar to balance the heat and draw out the other flavors.
8. Serve as is, or garnished with fresh jalapeño, cilantro, red onion, and/or avocado (optional).
9. Store leftovers in the refrigerator up to 4 days, and in the freezer up to 1 month. Reheat on the stovetop, or in the microwave.

On top of all this, the consensus of the neuroscience community on the capacity of non-human animals to possess consciousness is given in the [Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_consciousness#Cambridge_Declaration_on_Consciousness):

&gt; The absence of a neocortex does not appear to preclude an organism from experiencing affective states. Convergent evidence indicates that non-human animals have the neuroanatomical, neurochemical, and neurophysiological substrates of conscious states along with the capacity to exhibit intentional behaviors. Consequently, the weight of evidence indicates that humans are not unique in possessing the neurological substrates that generate consciousness. Non-human animals, including all mammals and birds, and many other creatures, including octopuses, also possess these neurological substrates.

&gt; It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

**Ingredients**

* 1 250g (8.8oz) bag of kale
* 4 garlic cloves
* 2 lemons, juiced
* 1 cup of walnuts
* 1-2 avocados
* About ½ cup of extra virgin olive oil
* Salt, to taste
* 1 500g (18oz) packet of pasta

**Instructions**

1. Start by lightly steaming the kale. I used a steaming basket which sat in a saucepan to do this in two batches. You want to get the kale a little softened, without properly cooking it. It will take just a couple of minutes and will turn bright green.
2. Now start cooking your pasta. Bring a large pan of water to the boil and add your spaghetti. While it's cooking, you will make the pesto.
3. If you have a large food processor, put the kale in with the walnuts, avocado, garlic and lemon juice in and whizz until it's blended but still chunky.
4. If you're using the hand blender method as I did, put the kale into a large bowl. Pour in the lemon juice. Place the walnuts and garlic on top of the kale and pour the olive oil over them. Press the hand blender down over all of the garlic cloves and blend until the garlic is completely pureed in that spot. Now move the blending stick around and blend all of the walnuts (these can be a little chunkier) and kale to achieve the desired texture. Some bits of kale could be left almost whole if you'd like it more textured.
5. When the pasta is ready, drain and return the pan.
6. Top with the pesto, add salt and pepper to taste, and then use tongs to distribute it. It can take a lot of work to get the pesto mixed in, because the kale sticks together a lot! You may need to add a little more oil.

* 2 avocados, pit and skin removed, roughly chopped
* 1/2 of a lime
* 1/2 of a lemon
* 1/4 teaspoon salt (plus extra as needed)
* 1/3 cup corn kernels (raw, from about 1/2 of a large cob, or thawed from frozen)
* 1/4 cup red bell pepper, diced
* 2 tablespoons diced poblano pepper
* 1 tablespoon diced red onion
* 1 tablespoon diced jalapeño pepper
* 2 teaspoons minced cilantro
* 1 clove garlic, minced

**For the black beans**

* 1 can black beans (15 ounces)
* 1/3 cup corn kerns (raw, from 1/2 of a large cob, or thawed from frozen)
* 1/4 cup red bell pepper, diced
* 1/4 cup poblano peppers, diced
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin

**For the tacos**

* 6 small flour or soft corn tortillas
* 2 cups chopped iceberg or romaine lettuce
* 1 tablespoon minced cilantro
* hot sauce, such as Cholula or Sriracha (optional)
* lime and/or lemon wedges

###Instructions

**Prepare the guacamole**

1. Mash the avocado in a medium bowl with a fork (or molcajete) until it reaches your desired consistency, chunky or smooth. Add a small squeeze each of lime and lemon juice, along with 1/4 teaspoon salt. Mix well and taste. Add more lime juice, lemon juice, and salt as you like. Stir in the remaining guacamole ingredients. (To make ahead, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and press gently against the guacamole. The entire surface of the guac should be touching and covered by the wrap, to keep air out. Then, cover the bowl with a second sheet of wrap, and refrigerate.)

**Prepare the black beans**

1. Add all of the black bean ingredients to a 2 quart sauce pot and heat over medium-low until hot. Turn off the heat and allow to cool to a very warm, eatable temp (a few minutes should do it).

**Assemble**

1. If the tortillas are not soft and pliable (or if you like your tortillas warm), stack them on a microwaveable plate, separated with paper towels, and heat for 20 to 30 seconds.
2. Line half of each tortilla with lettuce. Spoon the black bean mixture over the lettuce (on half of the tortilla). Spoon guacamole on the other half. Top with a few shakes of hot sauce (optional) and a sprinkle of cilantro. Serve with lemon and lime wedges.

* 1-2 avocados
* About ½ cup of extra virgin olive oil
* Salt, to taste
* 1 500g (18oz) packet of pasta

**Instructions**

1. Start by lightly steaming the kale. I used a steaming basket which sat in a saucepan to do this in two batches. You want to get the kale a little softened, without properly cooking it. It will take just a couple of minutes and will turn bright green.
2. Now start cooking your pasta. Bring a large pan of water to the boil and add your spaghetti. While it's cooking, you will make the pesto.
3. If you have a large food processor, put the kale in with the walnuts, avocado, garlic and lemon juice in and whizz until it's blended but still chunky.
4. If you're using the hand blender method as I did, put the kale into a large bowl. Pour in the lemon juice. Place the walnuts and garlic on top of the kale and pour the olive oil over them. Press the hand blender down over all of the garlic cloves and blend until the garlic is completely pureed in that spot. Now move the blending stick around and blend all of the walnuts (these can be a little chunkier) and kale to achieve the desired texture. Some bits of kale could be left almost whole if you'd like it more textured.
5. When the pasta is ready, drain and return the pan.
6. Top with the pesto, add salt and pepper to taste, and then use tongs to distribute it. It can take a lot of work to get the pesto mixed in, because the kale sticks together a lot! You may need to add a little more oil.

8. Garnish with some fresh cilantro and serve warm with some fresh roti, naan, or toasted french bread.

**Notes**

To Cook Black Lentils - Add the black lentils in a bowl. Wash and soak in water for about 20-30 minutes. Drain the water and cook using one of two methods: (1) Pressure Cooker , or (2) Pot of boiling water. Cook the Dal until soft, but not mushy. Drain the water after cooking the dal. I typically cook a bunch at once in my pressure cooker, cool, and freeze leftover plain cooked black lentils in a freezer bag. Then simply thaw and use to make this soup for a quick meal when needed.

1127,"Vegans are the ones doing the research, running the companies, and funding the projects that will bring cultured meat to market. Take a look at [The Good Food Institute]( http://www.thegoodfoodinstitute.org/) for just one example of this (a project organized by the animal rights group Mercy For Animals, funded by vegans, and run by well-recognized individuals in the animal rights movement). You will see that many of the projects they are funding are front runners in developing cultured meat.

There is a good reason why this is the case. Vegans are people who have recognized how harmful the current state of animal agriculture is. This is why they do not support it, and are working so diligently to create better alternatives so that the future will be brighter for everyone.

Here is the definition of veganism given by The Vegan Society (the group that originally coined the term), which can also be found in the sidebar of /r/vegan:

&gt;Veganism is a way of living that seeks to exclude, as far as possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing and any other purpose.

Assuming we are able to produce these products in the future without animal exploitation or cruelty then they will be entirely vegan. Some vegans will still avoid these products as will many non-vegans, but the reasons for this will be unrelated to veganism.",2016-07-22 19:38:34+00:00,d5mri4e,1.0,t3_4u37p4,16114.0,vegan

However, I also want to add that tens of thousands of cases is a small drop in a bucket when compared to the tens of billions of farmed animals enduring abuse each year. Furthermore, going after and prosecuting cases can take a lot of effort for each individual cases while shifting attitudes and creating dietary change can have a very large impact for a smaller amount of effort.",2016-07-22 18:46:41+00:00,d5mp1va,4.0,t1_d5mniz6,1893.0,vegan
1129,"Anyone who actually used nature, evolution, or history as the basis for their behavior would be a monster. Nature is rightly described as being red in tooth and claw, and human history is filled with tragic injustices. In nature, humans evolved to care about members of our own tribe, and even within tribes terrible things were inflicted upon certain groups like women. Over time we have rightly moved past this, to consider the interests of individuals from larger tribes, nations, races, and many other categories. Including other animals is just the next step forward to giving others the consideration that they deserve.

There are many reasons why avoiding meat is an important ethical issue:

The routine use of low doses of antibiotics on factory farms to promote growth creates prime conditions for the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria, which pose one of the largest threats to human health. [80 percent of the antibiotics sold in the United States are used in meat and poultry production](http://consumersunion.org/news/the-overuse-of-antibiotics-in-food-animals-threatens-public-health-2/), and it is estimated that antimicrobial resistance [will cost 300 million lives and up to $100 trillion from the global economy by 2050](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/antibiotic-resistance-will-kill-300-million-people-by-2050/).

The World Bank estimates that [91% of the land deforested in the Amazon since 1970 has been cleared for grazing](http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/02/02/000090341_20040202130625/Rendered/PDF/277150PAPER0wbwp0no1022.pdf). Raising cattle for food requires far more land than growing plant-based foods directly for consumption. It also is a substantial contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, [a bigger share than all of transportation according to the UN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock%27s_Long_Shadow). However, those aren't the only areas of serious concern. The UN has also stated:

&gt;The livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global. The findings of this report suggest that it should be a major policy focus when dealing with problems of land degradation, climate change and air pollution, water shortage and water pollution and loss of biodiversity.

&gt;Livestock's contribution to environmental problems is on a massive scale and its potential contribution to their solution is equally large. The impact is so significant that it needs to be addressed with urgency. Major reductions in impact could be achieved at reasonable cost.

Turn off the heat and cover. (For extra creaminess or a thinner polenta, stir in ¼-1/2 cup of plain almond milk.) Season with salt and black pepper and set aside.
2. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet. Add the mushrooms and cook for 3-5 minutes or until mushrooms have released some of their liquid and begin to brown slightly.
3. Stir in the flour. Add the vegetable broth and wine and continue to stir. Add the oregano, dried parsley, garlic powder, and a dash each of salt and black pepper.Bring to a simmer and continue to cook until thickened to gravy consistency.
4. Stir in the sliced seitan and cook another 2 minutes or until seitan is heated through.

4. Start mixing the composition. It has to be sticky and easy to shape. If it’s not it means that you didn’t strain the lentils very good and the composition is too wet. No problem, just add more flour until it has a dough-like consistency. Alternatively, let it rest in the fridge for 10-15 minutes.
5. Spray a non stick pan with some oil. Not too much. Put each patty on the frying pan and let it fry about 2 minutes on each side.

Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

&gt; A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/guidelines-publications/n55)**

&gt; Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns.

The routine use of low doses of antibiotics on factory farms to promote growth creates prime conditions for the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria, which pose one of the largest threats to human health. [80 percent of the antibiotics sold in the United States are used in meat and poultry production](http://consumersunion.org/news/the-overuse-of-antibiotics-in-food-animals-threatens-public-health-2/), and it is estimated that antimicrobial resistance [will cost 300 million lives and up to $100 trillion from the global economy by 2050](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/antibiotic-resistance-will-kill-300-million-people-by-2050/).

&gt;The livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global. The findings of this report suggest that it should be a major policy focus when dealing with problems of land degradation, climate change and air pollution, water shortage and water pollution and loss of biodiversity.

&gt;Livestock's contribution to environmental problems is on a massive scale and its potential contribution to their solution is equally large. The impact is so significant that it needs to be addressed with urgency. Major reductions in impact could be achieved at reasonable cost.

1. Add lentils in a pot and cover them with water. From the moment they start boiling, let them boil for about 15 minutes and then remove from heat.
2. Strain the lentils very well and put them in a large bowl. Start mashing them using a fork or a vertical blender. 3. Add the rest of the ingredients, except oil.
4. Start mixing the composition. It has to be sticky and easy to shape. If it’s not it means that you didn’t strain the lentils very good and the composition is too wet.

**Instructions**

1. Heat broth/water to a simmer in a medium saucepan. Stir in the polenta. Cook, stirring frequently until liquid is absorbed and polenta forms a pudding texture, about 20-25 minutes. Turn off the heat and cover. (For extra creaminess or a thinner polenta, stir in ¼-1/2 cup of plain almond milk.) Season with salt and black pepper and set aside.
2. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet. Add the mushrooms and cook for 3-5 minutes or until mushrooms have released some of their liquid and begin to brown slightly.
3. Stir in the flour. Add the vegetable broth and wine and continue to stir. Add the oregano, dried parsley, garlic powder, and a dash each of salt and black pepper.Bring to a simmer and continue to cook until thickened to gravy consistency.
4. Stir in the sliced seitan and cook another 2 minutes or until seitan is heated through.
5. Divide seitan and polenta evenly among 2-3 bowls and serve.

My posts on /r/food have only been pictures of food, recipes, and appropriate responses to questions about those recipes (you can verify this from the link to my submission history here).

&gt;I understand the rules of this subreddit, and I hope that /u/luster ’s feelings about my passion for veganism and animal rights elsewhere will not prevent me from being allowed to contribute in an appropriate way on this subreddit.

**Mod 2**

&gt;perhaps your passion is best expressed at /r/healthyfood. Folks like a good burger here and advocating a vegan diet is essentially dumping on what most people are here for.

&gt;I have made lots of posts about veganism on subreddits where such discussion is allowed and encouraged.

&gt;Here it leads to anger, massive reports, name calling, trolling and bans all around.

&gt;I have eliminated red meat from my diet since January. Feels great. But I don't proselytize.

**/u/lnfinity** 

&gt;I understand that people on /r/food eat meat, but I also have firsthand experience seeing that meat-free submissions can be [incredibly popular here](https://np.reddit.com/r/food/comments/3vkevo/whole_roasted_cauliflower/). People here can discuss meat-free submissions with civility regardless of whether or not they are vegetarian themselves. For example /u/jeffykins once wrote on my Tofu and Mushroom Stroganoff submission:

&gt;&gt; As a voracious meat-eater I want to tell you how delicious this looks! I am going to try making this for my mushroom obsessed girlfriend!

&gt;[Source](https://np.reddit.com/r/food/comments/3pn2gn/tofu_and_mushroom_stroganoff/cw829eu)

&gt;However, I’m sure you do get reports and inappropriate comments. Let me reiterate once again that I will not be a part of the anger, name calling, and trolling. My discussions of animal rights have always remained on subreddits where they are appropriate, which is not /r/food. The response to such inappropriate behavior when it does take place shouldn’t be to ban people who post vegan recipes, or to prohibit vegan content outright (based upon /u/randoh12’s recent comments on /r/vegan I understand that the current position of the mod team is that vegan content is welcome on /r/food) but rather to delete the comments that are inappropriate, and ban those who continuously fail to follow the rules.

**Mod 2**

&gt;We are going to unban you but your posts will require mod approval. Every time you post it will be reported and a manual approval will be required.

**/u/lnfinity**

&gt;Will there be some timeline for removing this restriction once I continue to follow the subreddit’s rules? I’m sure you know that the first hour or so after a new post is made is a vital time for it to gain upvotes that will determine whether it is quickly forgotten or rises to the frontpage. I’m also sure that you all have lives outside of moderating /r/food, and cannot be there to quickly approve posts at all times. This restriction would still be a substantial burden on my ability to participate in this community.

&gt;I understand your reluctance to unban anyone. I moderate a handful of subreddits myself, and I would share your hesitance to remove a ban, but I have a long history that I have shared with you of appropriate content on this subreddit as well as across reddit where I have accumulated over a million submission karma as a welcome member of the many default and non-default communities in which I participate. Even /u/luster’s reason for banning me was not over any submissions or comments that I made on /r/food, but because I allegedly “posted on how one should use reddit to further their vegan agenda” elsewhere.

&gt;I would like the opportunity to submit recipes that are subjected to the same standards of moderation as everyone else. I know that when vegans raise objections on meat-based recipes that they are given warnings and bans by the moderation team, and I would like to see the same standard applied when meat eaters cause “anger, massive reports, name calling, and trolling” on plant-based recipes. Similarly, I hope that when appropriate posts are made regardless of whether or not they are vegan or the views of the person who posts them, that they can be moderated in the same way instead of being relegated to /r/healthyfood or elsewhere. Isn't this a reasonable expectation?

**Mod 2**

&gt;The modqueue is well tended and we will get a report when you post. I doubt any of your posts will lose any time.

&gt;Share the food and just the food. We want you off the watchlist as soon as possible.

&gt;You are unbanned. You aren't being relegated anywhere. I was making a suggestion. Are we done here? It is a busy day.",2016-07-20 18:46:32+00:00,d5jwbyo,1.0,t3_4tr2lm,19853.0,vegan

1173,"**Ingredients**

* 2 cups broccolini, cut into florets with 1½ inch stems 
* 1 ½ cups sugar snap peas 
* 6 ounces dried fettuccine 
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 shallot, diced
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* ¼ cup white wine
* 1 cup vegetable stock
* 1 lemon, juiced
* 1 tablespoon capers (in brine, drained)
* ½ cup Just Mayo 
* ½ cup cherry tomatoes, quartered
* 1 tablespoon parsley, chopped 

**Directions**

1. Fill a large bowl with 1 ½ cups of ice and enough water to fill the bowl. Set ice bath beside the stove. 
2. In a large pot, bring salted water to a rolling boil. Carefully add the broccolini and sugar snap peas to the water. Blanch vegetables until bright green, yet still crisp, about 30-40 seconds. Using a slotted spoon, remove the veggies from the boiling water and immediately drop into the ice bath, shocking them to stop the cooking process to preserve the color. Discard the blanching water.
3. In the same pot, bring new, clean salted water to boil. Cook fettuccine as directed on the package. Drain and reserve a ½ cup of cooking liquid. Set drained pasta aside.
4. In a large sauté pan over medium-low heat, warm the olive oil until shimmering. Add the shallot and garlic and cook until tender, about 8-10 minutes. Lower heat if needed to prevent browning. 
5. Add the white wine and scrape any brown bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to deglaze the pan. Cook until the liquid is reduced by half, about 3 minutes. 
6. Add the vegetable stock, lemon juice, and capers and simmer until reduced by half, about 10-15 minutes.
7. Add Just Mayo and whisk until incorporated.
8. Add the drained fettuccine, blanched vegetables and tomatoes to the pan. Toss to coat all the ingredients. Cook until the pasta and vegetables are heated throughout.
9. Garnish with parsley and serve immediately.

**Ingredients**

* 1 cup sushi or short grain rice
* 12 ounces firm tofu
* ½ teaspoon vegetable oil or cooking spray
* 3 tablespoons Just Balsamic
* ¼ cup rice vinegar
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 2 teaspoons salt
* 6-8 rice paper wrappers
* 6-8 nori sheets
* ½- ¾ cup Just Mayo Wasabi
* 3 green onions, white and light green parts only, cut into matchsticks
* 1 cucumber, cut into matchsticks
* 1 avocado, pitted, peeled and thinly sliced
* 1 ½ cups red cabbage, thinly sliced
* 1 cup red bell pepper, thinly sliced into strips
* ½ cup loosely packed cilantro leaves, stems removed

**Directions**

1. To make the sushi rice, rinse the rice under cool water until the water runs clear. Add the rice and 1½ cups water to a medium saucepan, and soak for 30 minutes. Bring the water to a boil and lower the heat to the lowest setting and cover the saucepan. Simmer for 20 minutes or until the water has evaporated. Remove from heat. Let the rice sit for 10 minutes covered. 
2. While the rice is cooking, prepare the tofu. Preheat the oven to 375ºF. Cut the tofu into 4 equal pieces. Lightly grease a baking dish with vegetable oil or cooking spray. Place the tofu in the dish and brush both sides with Just Balsamic. Bake until just beginning to brown, about 10 to 15 minutes. When the tofu is cool enough to touch, slice the pieces into ¼-inch wide rectangles. 
3. Heat the vinegar, sugar and salt in a small saucepan over low heat until the sugar and salt are fully dissolved. Pour the vinegar mixture over the cooked rice. Gently mix with a wooden spoon or spatula until all grains of rice are seasoned.
4. Fill a deep, wide dish with several inches of warm water. Working one at a time, completely immerse a rice paper wrapper in the warm water for about ten seconds or until it begins to soften. Gently remove it from the water and shake off any excess water. Place the softened wrapper on a large plate or clean cutting board and carefully spread it out so the edges are smooth. Lay down a nori sheet on top of the rice paper wrapper. Squeeze about two tablespoons of Just Mayo Wasabi onto the nori and spread leaving about a two-inch perimeter. Evenly spread about 1/3 cup of seasoned rice over the nori. Place a few strips of the green onion, cucumber, avocado, red cabbage, red bell pepper, tofu, and a few leaves of cilantro on rice, horizontally on lower third of the wrapper. Gently lift the rice paper and roll until the sushi burrito is formed and sealed. Repeat until all sushi burritos are formed.
5. Slice each sushi burrito in half on a bias and serve with soy sauce or tamari.

&gt; Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day.

&gt;The livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global. The findings of this report suggest that it should be a major policy focus when dealing with problems of land degradation, climate change and air pollution, water shortage and water pollution and loss of biodiversity.

&gt;Livestock's contribution to environmental problems is on a massive scale and its potential contribution to their solution is equally large. The impact is so significant that it needs to be addressed with urgency. Major reductions in impact could be achieved at reasonable cost.

The food chain (or more accurately the food web) explains how nutrients move about in nature. It doesn’t tell us who we should or shouldn’t kill any more than the water cycle tells us whether or not we should dam rivers.

The findings of this report suggest that it should be a major policy focus when dealing with problems of land degradation, climate change and air pollution, water shortage and water pollution and loss of biodiversity.

&gt;Livestock's contribution to environmental problems is on a massive scale and its potential contribution to their solution is equally large. The impact is so significant that it needs to be addressed with urgency. Major reductions in impact could be achieved at reasonable cost.

Furthermore, cows’ milk production begins to drop after a few years (well before their 20+ year lifespan). When it is no longer profitable to keep the cows, the cows are sent to slaughter regardless of whether or not the farm is free-range.

The situation in the egg industry is very similar. Male chicks are either ground up alive, gassed, or simply tossed into trash bags to die within hours of hatching (some companies are looking to phase this out by destroying eggs with male chicks prior to hatching. This will be implemented in the next 5-10 years). Egg laying hens' production will start to drop after about 2-3 years after which they are typically sent to slaughter. 

There are no farms that are keeping male cattle and chickens alive out of charity and supporting their cows and hens into old age either. These animals are all being slaughtered.

The number of dairy farms in the UK [is less than half of what it was 10 years ago](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/12128033/Dairy-farms-squeezed-even-harder-as-income-halves-due-to-milk-price-war.html), and given particularly low prices in the last year the industry has positioned itself well to continue demanding that the government continue paying for their unsustainable businesses. These farms depend upon EU subsidies to exist, and the expectation is that they will continue to exist if the UK chose to leave the EU.

If the UK wanted to reduce subsidies for animal agriculture, or improve conditions for farmed animals, it is true that it would have a smaller vote as part of the EU, but it also has the ability to impact conditions for a larger number of animals while in the EU. These two things are proportional, the UK’s representation in the European Parliament is proportional to its share of the overall population.

As you’ve stated, there are many advantages to EU membership. It allows people to move freely between more countries, and it creates common standards with minimal tariffs that allow trade to take place openly and conveniently.  These are things that are good for both people and businesses. 

That latter reason is why you see that [business leaders are overwhelmingly in support of remaining in the EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum#Business_leaders), and this also includes animal farming businesses.

**Palm Oil**

&gt;A century ago there were probably more than 230,000 orangutans in total, but the Bornean orangutan is now estimated to number about 45,000-69,000 (Endangered) and the Sumatran about 7,500 (Critically Endangered). 

[Source](http://www.worldwildlife.org/species/orangutan). 

Even if 100% of the decline in the orangutan population was due to palm oil, this would be minuscule compared to the number of animals killed by other forms of agriculture. 

According to Wikipedia the world produced 48 million tonnes of palm oil in 2008. This amounts to roughly 432,000,000,000,000 (432 trillion) calories. Assuming that orangutans were killed at the same pace in 2008 as they had been for the rest of the past century that would be (230,000-45,000)/100 = 1,850 orangutans killed that year.

This amounts to 0.000004 orangutans killed per million calories. Compare that to the 1.65 animals estimated to be killed per million calories of grains produced, 1.73 per million calories of fruits, and 2.65 per million calories of vegetables, and 251 animals per million calories of chicken.

I live in the United States. The majority of our forests and once natural land have been cut down or cleared for agricultural or other uses. Animals have been displaced. Agriculture takes up a substantial portion of our landscape. 

The United States has a much lower population density than South East Asia where the majority of palm oil is grown. The people here are living luxuriously in large part aided by the exploitation of huge swaths of land, yet when people in other countries do it to a much lesser extent on a per capita basis we fault them for it?

The United States does at least have some stronger environmental protections in place that prevent some degree of clear cutting and burning, but the issue of lower environmental standards in some parts of the world is not an issue with palm oil. Just about any industry you look at and any agriculture you look at in parts of the world with lower environmental standards will have some areas where they are exploiting the lack of regulation. 

This shouldn’t be an excuse to boycott all products from countries that do not have solid environmental regulations either. Countries are understandably less worried about environmental damage that will cause people to die at age 70 when they are struggling to keep people alive to age 60 due to poverty. The solution to the issue is a combination of pushing for better environmental standards along with creating more opportunities for people in poor parts of the world to earn a living, not taking away one of the few sources of income that exists.

**Soy**

The attack on vegans for eating soy that is deforesting the Amazon is entirely misplaced when the World Bank estimates that [91% of the land deforested in the Amazon since 1970 has been cleared for grazing](http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/02/02/000090341_20040202130625/Rendered/PDF/277150PAPER0wbwp0no1022.pdf), and the majority of the world’s soy is fed to non-human animals. 

Switching from consuming animal products to nearly any crop would require much less land, and soy happens to be a very efficient crop.

Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/guidelines-publications/n55)**

&gt; Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

&gt; A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**Preparing the dish**

* 1 pkg gardein chick'n tenders
* 2 1/2 tbsp butter (or vegan option)
* 1/4 cup hot sauce of choice
* 1/2 tbsp garlic granules
* 1 tbsp tomato paste
* 1/4 tsp black pepper
* water (to thin)
* 4 10"" or 12"" tortillas
* 1/2 cup vegan Ranch Dressing
* 1/2 cup celery, sliced paper-thin (on a mandolin)
* 1/2 cup carrots, sliced paper-thin (on a mandolin)
* Handful of butter lettuce

**Ranch Dressing**

* 1/2 cup vegan mayonnaise
* 1 1/2 tbsp rice wine vinegar
* 1/2 lemon juice
* 1 1/2 tbsp nutritional yeast
* 1 tbsp shallot, minced
* 1/2 tbsp agave or other sweetener of choice
* 1/4 cup soy or almond milk, unsweetened
* 1 1/2 tbsp fresh dill, minced
* 1 tbsp fresh chives, minced

###Preparation

Preheat the oven to 425°F and cook the Chick'n Tenders according to package instructions. Set aside. 

To make the sauce: Heat a fry pan over medium heat and then add the butter. Once the butter has melted, add the hot sauce, tomato paste, garlic granules and pepper. Whisk to combine the ingredients. If needed, add a bit of water to thin out the sauce. Once done, remove from heat. 

Lastly, add the Tenders to the sauce, gently flipping them to completely coat them in sauce. 

To assemble the wraps, place some lettuce onto a tortilla and then add a few pieces of the Buffalo Chick’n Strips. Then top with some thinly sliced carrots and celery. 

Lastly, top with some ranch dressing and then roll and serve immediately. 

**Ranch Dressing**

This egg-free creamy ranch dressing is a delicious addition to any salad, served as a dip or a cooling dressing with the Buffalo Chick'n Wrap. 

In small mixing bowl, whisk together all ingredients. Add additional soy or almond milk as needed for desired consistency. 

This is a wonderful creamy dressing to add to salads, serve as a dip for crudités, or to use as a cooling creamy dressing for the Buffalo Chick’n Wrap.

1551,"Cows (like all mammals) only produce a significant amount of milk for a limited period of time after they have had a calf. Dairy farmers don’t make money if the calf is drinking too much of the mother’s milk, so the calves are typically separated from their mothers shortly after birth. I’m sure you can imagine that this is traumatic for any animal to have their offspring taken from them. [Here is an example of that taking place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zLypnXJ0QQ).

The male calves will never produce any milk. They are typically raised for veal, which is a notoriously cruel industry as the meat is more valuable for its light color and soft texture, which is achieved by depriving the calves of iron and restricting movement. The female calves will face a similar fate as their mothers. 

Cows have been bred to produce far more milk than they would have historically, and this has put them at risk for additional complications. [Mastitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastitis_in_dairy_cattle) is a painful infection of the breast tissue that is very common on contemporary dairy farms.

Dairy production in dairy cows does not continue at a high rate for their entire lives. When production begins to drop (usually around 5 years of age) the cows are still sent to slaughter.

These are just the conditions that will be found in just about every commercial dairy operation.

The routine use of low doses of antibiotics on factory farms to promote growth creates prime conditions for the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria, which pose one of the largest threats to human health. [80 percent of the antibiotics sold in the United States are used in meat and poultry production](http://consumersunion.org/news/the-overuse-of-antibiotics-in-food-animals-threatens-public-health-2/), and it is estimated that antimicrobial resistance [will cost 300 million lives and up to $100 trillion from the global economy by 2050](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/antibiotic-resistance-will-kill-300-million-people-by-2050/).

The World Bank estimates that [91% of the land deforested in the Amazon since 1970 has been cleared for grazing](http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/02/02/000090341_20040202130625/Rendered/PDF/277150PAPER0wbwp0no1022.pdf). Raising cattle for food requires far more land than growing plant-based foods directly for consumption. It also is a substantial contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, [a bigger share than all of transportation according to the UN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock%27s_Long_Shadow). However, those aren't the only areas of serious concern. The UN has also stated:

&gt;The livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global. The findings of this report suggest that it should be a major policy focus when dealing with problems of land degradation, climate change and air pollution, water shortage and water pollution and loss of biodiversity.

&gt;Livestock's contribution to environmental problems is on a massive scale and its potential contribution to their solution is equally large. The impact is so significant that it needs to be addressed with urgency. Major reductions in impact could be achieved at reasonable cost.

* 2 cups broccolini, cut into florets with 1½ inch stems 
* 1 ½ cups sugar snap peas 
* 6 ounces dried fettuccine 
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 shallot, diced
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* ¼ cup white wine
* 1 cup vegetable stock
* 1 lemon, juiced
* 1 tablespoon capers (in brine, drained)
* ½ cup Just Mayo 
* ½ cup cherry tomatoes, quartered
* 1 tablespoon parsley, chopped 

**Directions**

1. Fill a large bowl with 1 ½ cups of ice and enough water to fill the bowl. Set ice bath beside the stove. 
2. In a large pot, bring salted water to a rolling boil. Carefully add the broccolini and sugar snap peas to the water. Blanch vegetables until bright green, yet still crisp, about 30-40 seconds. Using a slotted spoon, remove the veggies from the boiling water and immediately drop into the ice bath, shocking them to stop the cooking process to preserve the color. Discard the blanching water.
3. In the same pot, bring new, clean salted water to boil. Cook fettuccine as directed on the package. Drain and reserve a ½ cup of cooking liquid. Set drained pasta aside.
4. In a large sauté pan over medium-low heat, warm the olive oil until shimmering. Add the shallot and garlic and cook until tender, about 8-10 minutes. Lower heat if needed to prevent browning. 
5. Add the white wine and scrape any brown bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to deglaze the pan. Cook until the liquid is reduced by half, about 3 minutes. 
6. Add the vegetable stock, lemon juice, and capers and simmer until reduced by half, about 10-15 minutes.
7. Add Just Mayo and whisk until incorporated.
8. Add the drained fettuccine, blanched vegetables and tomatoes to the pan. Toss to coat all the ingredients. Cook until the pasta and vegetables are heated throughout.
9. Garnish with parsley and serve immediately.

&gt;Despite these foods being processed, the technology involved generates around 10 times less greenhouse gasses than the processes associated with making beef products. This was based on an emissions assessment from the field, to the factory, and finally to the grocery store. The factors assessed included fertilizer and pesticides use; the water consumptions; energy expended for cultivation, harvesting, and transportation.

&gt; Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12. 

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/guidelines-publications/n55)**

&gt; Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

&gt; A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

1637,"Most people don’t go vegan because of the health benefits. Veganism helps provide structure that leads many people to eating healthier, but there are a lot of other reasons that motivate people to go vegan:

The routine use of low doses of antibiotics on factory farms to promote growth creates prime conditions for the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria, which pose one of the largest threats to human health. [80 percent of the antibiotics sold in the United States are used in meat and poultry production](http://consumersunion.org/news/the-overuse-of-antibiotics-in-food-animals-threatens-public-health-2/), and it is estimated that antimicrobial resistance [will cost 300 million lives and up to $100 trillion from the global economy by 2050](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/antibiotic-resistance-will-kill-300-million-people-by-2050/).

The World Bank estimates that [91% of the land deforested in the Amazon since 1970 has been cleared for grazing](http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/02/02/000090341_20040202130625/Rendered/PDF/277150PAPER0wbwp0no1022.pdf). Raising cattle for food requires far more land than growing plant-based foods directly for consumption. It also is a substantial contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, [a bigger share than all of transportation according to the UN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock%27s_Long_Shadow). However, those aren't the only areas of serious concern. The UN has also stated:

&gt;The livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global. The findings of this report suggest that it should be a major policy focus when dealing with problems of land degradation, climate change and air pollution, water shortage and water pollution and loss of biodiversity.

&gt;Livestock's contribution to environmental problems is on a massive scale and its potential contribution to their solution is equally large. The impact is so significant that it needs to be addressed with urgency. Major reductions in impact could be achieved at reasonable cost.

1663,"&gt;A century ago there were probably more than 230,000 orangutans in total, but the Bornean orangutan is now estimated to number about 45,000-69,000 (Endangered) and the Sumatran about 7,500 (Critically Endangered). 

[Source](http://www.worldwildlife.org/species/orangutan). 

Even if 100% of the decline in the orangutan population was due to palm oil, this would be minuscule compared to the number of animals killed by other forms of agriculture. 

According to Wikipedia the world produced 48 million tonnes of palm oil in 2008. This amounts to roughly 432,000,000,000,000 (432 trillion) calories. Assuming that orangutans were killed at the same pace in 2008 as they had been for the rest of the past century that would be (230,000-45,000)/100 = 1,850 orangutans killed that year.

This amounts to 0.000004 orangutans killed per million calories. Compare that to the 1.65 animals estimated to be killed per million calories of grains produced, 1.73 per million calories of fruits, and 2.65 per million calories of vegetables.

&gt;Morally objecting to eating an animal simply because you don't see plant tears and plants can't scream, even considering plants show similar responses to stimuli as animals do, strikes me as silly.

Plants have been found to react to stimuli, much like my computer reacts to me pushing on the keys, a rock reacts to being kicked, or baking soda reacts to vinegar. This isn't evidence that they are capable of caring about how they are treated; however, even supposing that they do then it wouldn't logically follow that it is okay for us to abuse both plants and animals. What would follow is that we ought to take reasonable efforts to treat both plants and animals with respect. Far more plants have to be killed to be fed to animals to get the same amount of food from animals compared to eating the plants directly.

these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

&gt; Veganism is a way of living that seeks to exclude, as far as possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing and any other purpose.

Vegans aren’t opposed to the shape, texture, or taste of animals. They are opposed to supporting animal abuse.",2016-05-25 18:58:35+00:00,d3jfk7u,1.0,t3_4l0xm3,3916.0,AskReddit

&gt; It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

&gt; A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range. 

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

&gt;Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/tips-vegetarians)**

&gt; Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12. 

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/guidelines-publications/n55)**

&gt; Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

1842,"Thanks for taking the time to show interest in and ask questions about veganism!

&gt;Do you believe killing and eating an animal is ethically wrong?

I don’t care what people eat, but I don’t think supporting the exploitation and abuse of animals that is an inescapable part of commercially producing animal products is acceptable. I do care about who people are harming with their consumption choices just like I hope you do too.

&gt;Would you feel comfortable eating an animal that was raised on a small farm?

No, abusing animals still isn’t acceptable if done on a small scale.

&gt;Do you believe that there are no health benefits that come from eating meat?

[There is overwhelming consensus that appropriately planned meat-free diets are healthy for all stages of life](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/wiki/dieteticorgs). People can get some nutrients from eating meat, but there are also many other ways to meet those same nutritional needs.

&gt;Would you be more willing to eat dairy that comes from a small farm?

[Inherent problems in dairy production](http://considerveganism.com/info/dairy-problems.jpg)

&gt;Do you think eating organic veggies makes a difference?

I don’t think eating organic is really beneficial, but of course it is different in some sense.

&gt;Were you ever a meat eater, like me? If you were, what changed your mind?

Yes, I ate meat for the first 18 years of my life. I changed because I realized that the immense suffering that other animals had to endure for animal products to be produce could not be justified by my minor preference in the convenience of eating animal products.

&gt;How do you feel about PETA?

The findings of this report suggest that it should be a major policy focus when dealing with problems of land degradation, climate change and air pollution, water shortage and water pollution and loss of biodiversity.

&gt;Livestock's contribution to environmental problems is on a massive scale and its potential contribution to their solution is equally large. The impact is so significant that it needs to be addressed with urgency. Major reductions in impact could be achieved at reasonable cost.

Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/tips-vegetarians)**

&gt; Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12. 

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/guidelines-publications/n55)**

&gt; Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

&gt;Livestock's contribution to environmental problems is on a massive scale and its potential contribution to their solution is equally large. The impact is so significant that it needs to be addressed with urgency. Major reductions in impact could be achieved at reasonable cost.

* 3 cups (240g) shredded unsweetened coconut
* 2 tablespoons (30ml) maple syrup
* 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon peppermint extract (food grade peppermint oil)
* 2 teaspoons coconut oil, divided
* 1 cup (120g) vegan dark chocolate, chopped

**Instructions**

1. Add shredded coconut to the bowl of a food processor or high speed blender. Blend, scraping down sides as needed, until a paste forms. The texture should feel like dough when squeezed between your fingers. Continue scraping down sides as it is blending.

2. Add maple syrup, peppermint extract, and one teaspoon coconut oil. Mix again until incorporated. Again, look for a dough like consistency. Scrape down sides as needed. Scoop the mixture and pack firmly using a tablespoon. Roll between palms to form a ball, and gently press down to form a disc. Use fingers to gently pat down so patties are not too tall.

3. Place patties on a parchment lined baking sheet or plate, and continue until all coconut mixture is used – the recipe should make about fourteen patties. Place in the freezer for ten minutes.

4. Melt the chocolate and the remaining one teaspoon coconut oil over a double boiler or in a microwave for thirty second increments until melted.

5. Individually place a chilled patty on the prongs of a fork to dip into the chocolate. Tap off any excess and set back on parchment. Continue until all of the patties are coated.

6. Place in refrigerator or freezer to set for eight to ten minutes or until chocolate is firm.

7. Peel the patties away from parchment and transfer to a serving platter. Serve at room temperature or chilled. The patties will keep covered at room temperature for three or four days, or in the freezer for up to one month. Best when fresh.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/tips-vegetarians)**

&gt; Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

&gt; Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein

In one version subjects were told that the island’s other inhabitants would eat the animals after they had been struck with electricity, while in another version this was not included. Otherwise the stories were identical.

After telling the story, the subjects were asked questions about the animals. Those who had been told that the animals were eaten after they died from being struck by lightning rated the animals as being less intelligent, less able to experience pain, and they expressed less concern for the treatment of the animals. When it comes to any individuals who suffer, we know that we have a tendency to denigrate the victim, and if someone is personally responsible for that suffering, then they have an even stronger tendency to fault their victims.

Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/tips-vegetarians)**

&gt; Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12. 

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/guidelines-publications/n55)**

&gt; Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

Jeremy Bentham, a famous utilitarian philosopher pondered on the subject of slavery in 1789. He famously wrote: 

&gt;The day has been, I grieve to say in many places it is not yet past, in which the greater part of the species, under the denomination of slaves, have been treated by the law exactly upon the same footing as, in England for example, the inferior races of animals are still. The day may come, when the rest of the animal creation may acquire those rights which never could have been withholden from them but by the hand of tyranny. The French have already discovered that the blackness of the skin is no reason why a human being should be abandoned without redress to the caprice of a tormentor. It may come one day to be recognized, that the number of the legs, the villosity of the skin, or the termination of the os sacrum, are reasons equally insufficient for abandoning a sensitive being to the same fate. What else is it that should trace the insuperable line? Is it the faculty of reason, or, perhaps, the faculty of discourse? But a full-grown horse or dog is beyond comparison a more rational, as well as a more conversable animal, than an infant of a day, or a week, or even a month, old. But suppose the case were otherwise, what would it avail? the question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?

Today, we are increasingly finding that many other animals possess capabilities far beyond what was recognized in Bentham's time. [Crows can solve problems as well as children up to age 7](http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2014/07/24/animals-crows-smarts-intelligence-science-minds/), [dolphins will communicate with one another over a telephone and appear to know who they are talking to](http://kids.nationalgeographic.com/explore/nature/secret-language-of-dolphins/) (this is hardly surprising given that they have ""signature whistles"" by which to identify one another), [rats who were trained to press a lever for food stop pressing it when they see that it causes another rat to receive an electric shock](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2011/12/09/empathic-rats-spring-each-other-from-jail/#.VTxJTPnF9XE), [many other animals react with elation when reunited with an individual who they knew many years ago](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/animal-reunions-full-episode/14089/). This is really just the tiniest tip of the iceberg about what we have uncovered about animal minds and behavior.

Other animals don't have all of the same capabilities that you or I do, but many animals do possess capabilities beyond those of certain humans to whom we grant greater rights (for example young children, the severely mentally handicapped, or elderly and senile individuals). This is known as the argument from species overlap. [Here is an excellent article that you can read on the subject](http://www.animal-ethics.org/argument-species-overlap/)

&gt; It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

&gt; A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

&gt; With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

&gt; A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range. 

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

&gt;Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/tips-vegetarians)**

&gt; Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12. 

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/guidelines-publications/n55)**

&gt; Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

&gt; A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

There is a good reason why this is the case. Vegans are people who have recognized how harmful the current state of animal agriculture is. This is why they do not support it, and are working so diligently to create better alternatives so that the future will be brighter for everyone.

Actions that harm others are inherently not merely personal choices, and choosing to harm others when alternatives exist that cause a great deal less harm to others for relatively little inconvenience on one’s own part is an unethical choice.

**Ingredients**

* 1 14-oz tub Just Cookie Dough Chocolate Chip, softened slightly at room temperature
* 1/2 cup warm water
* 1 1/2 tablespoons ground flax
* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* 3/4 teaspoon salt
* ½ cup natural cocoa powder
* ¼ cup chocolate chips or chopped dark chocolate
* 1/2 cup coconut oil
* 1 cup sugar
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

**Directions**

1. Preheat oven to 350°F and grease all sides of an 8×8 inch baking pan.
2. Vigorously whisk together the warm water and flax meal and set aside to thicken.
3. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt.
4. Combine the coconut oil and semisweet chocolate in a medium microwave safe bowl and microwave for 30-40 seconds, or until just melted and smooth. Stir to thoroughly combine and to complete the melting of the chocolate chips.
5. To the melted chocolate, add the sugar, flax mixture, and vanilla. Whisk vigorously to combine.
6. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix until all the ingredients are incorporated.
7. Scrape the batter into the prepared baking dish and smooth it evenly to the edges of the pan.
8. Drop heaping tablespoons of Just Cookie Dough evenly over the surface of the batter and press down gently into the brownie batter. Most of the surface should be covered but there should be at least 1/4-inch of brownie batter visible between each scoop of cookie dough.
9. You might not use the entire tub of cookie dough - save the extra for making cookies or snacking on raw!
10. Bake for 30-35 minutes or until the center is puffed and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, except for some melted chocolate from the cookie dough.
11. Cool for about 30 minutes, then slice into 16 squares and serve.

First of all, that wasn’t what was claimed at all.

However, you need to be gravely out of touch with reality to think that all severely mentally handicapped humans (a group that ranges from individuals with nothing more than a beating heart and basic organ function to those who will never progress beyond the mental capacity of young children) have greater cognitive capabilities than all non-human animals.

Nobody is suggesting that non-human animals require the right to free speech or the right to vote; however, the severely mentally handicapped (especially those who cannot speak) do not require these rights either. However, when it comes to rights like the right to not be abused or the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, these are things that many non-human animals are capable of appreciating, and it is not in line with our conservative values to have laws subsidizing industries that conduct this abuse, that force payments to government programs that promote these industries, or that hide the activities of these industries from the public.",2016-04-20 20:04:55+00:00,d2as1zd,4.0,t1_d2anzyw,4927.0,Conservative

This piece from the New York Times evaluates some of the implications of what the farmers have uncovered.

2232,"I chose to go vegan for animal rights reasons about eight years ago. I admittedly enjoyed the taste of meat as much as anyone I know, and I grew up with this being a significant part of my diet. However, over time I began to question whether the convenience and enjoyment I was getting out of eating meat was sufficient to justify the things that necessarily had to occur to other animals in order for that meat to be produced.

Vegans are often portrayed as believing that other animals ought to be treated as being equal to humans (an understandable belief given some frequently repeated quotes from Ingrid Newkirk of PETA). Other animals aren’t the same as you or I, and they do not require all of the same rights. Nonetheless, there is little doubt that there are many other animals who possess intelligence and other capacities beyond those of some humans who we would deem worthy of a higher level of consideration (for example young children, the severely mentally handicapped, or senile elderly individuals). While other animals do not possess interests to the same extent as the typical human, to the extent and degree that other animals do possess interests, I believe we ought to give [commensurate consideration to their interests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_consideration_of_interests) as we would to interests of a similar degree that are possessed by humans, and we should not discriminate on any other basis.

Many people point out that animals are still killed in the production of vegan foods as well as numerous other aspects of modern life. It is entirely true that adopting a vegan diet isn’t a solution to all of the world’s problems, or even all the ills that befall other animals as a result of our actions.

2255,"&gt; Animals eat grass, hay, silage or some other fermented plant material, corn, and soybean. Certain animals are capable of converting plant material in protein through the process of fermentation. We cannot, we can only use the amino acids present in the plant material. We cannot digest cellulose, hemicellulose, or lignan. So even if the plant has high protein content, we may not be able to fully utilize it.

Sure, other animals consume different foods than humans would, but if we are growing these foods as crops it is going to be much less efficient than if we were just growing crops directly for human consumption. The amount of meat that is produced from grazing is very small. The number of chickens and pigs grazing is negligible out of the total number of these animals slaughtered. Cattle are the only animals that are grazing in any significant quantity. Of these, cattle still only graze for about half of their lives before being sent to a feedlot where they are fattened up for slaughter.

2290,"I have been contacted by the person trying to orchestrate this four times from three different accounts. The things that have actually been submitted from those accounts have not been productive for promoting veganism (for example they post questions like ""Why aren't you vegan?"" to askReddit or ""Everyone should go vegan"" to /r/changemyview, which get people to articulate their reasons for not being vegan). 

They also seem incredibly ignorant of the tools that reddit possesses for preventing cheating and punishing the practice. They weren't aware that reddit would be able to catch on to them all voting on new submissions as a group. They weren't aware of what sources for votes will lead to votes actually being counted versus which will be ""fuzzed"" away. They weren't aware that reddit will temporarily take down submissions if voting looks sketchy and if the posts continue to receive votes while taken down then reddit will keep them down (and potentially punish the brigaders). They weren't aware that reddit would ban subreddits and submissions from certain websites if they are consistently involved with or supporting brigading.

However, suspiciously, this person does appear to be aware of how to get around reddit's site-wide ban.

It is the same person who harassed /u/yourlycantbsrs until he left reddit (making accounts that looked like theirs to post defamatory comments, and taking pictures from his Facebook and using his real name to dox him on the site).

There are two options here. First is that this is once again the same user who is dedicated to harassing and inciting hatred against vegans trying to orchestrate something new. The second is that there is someone who somehow figured out how to get around reddit's site wide bans, but is incredibly ignorant when it comes to how to effectively promote veganism or all the reasons why their plans for cheating are doomed to fail and ultimately backfire.

**Ingredients**

* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1/2 cup diced yellow onion
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* ½ a large jalapeno, minced (taste before adding all of the jalapeno, depending on how spicy you want the dish to be)
* 3/4 cup quinoa
* 1 cup vegetable broth
* 1 (15-ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
* 1 (14.5 oz) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes (not drained)

* 1 avocado, halved, seeded, peeled and diced
* Juice of 1 lime
* 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro leaves

**Instructions**

1. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet with a lid over medium heat.

2. Sauté the garlic and jalapeno until it starts to brown, about one minute.

2328,"There is overwhelming consensus that appropriately planned vegan diets are healthy for all stages of life. The only valid criticism I can see is that it could put children into challenging social situations, but these situations come up for all kinds of differences in life, and it can be a useful life lesson to learn how to approach them early on.

There are many benefits as well. A vegan diet can help encourage healthy eating habits that will stick for life. It can help with teaching children to treat other individuals (regardless of whether they are human or non-human) with respect. It comes with a far smaller environmental footprint than a typical Western diet, and it avoids supporting the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria from the overuse of antibiotics to promote growth of factory farms. Finally, it allows children to make a choice for themselves when they are at an age when they are able to make an informed decision instead of forcing them to engage in these harmful actions before they are able to make an informed choice.

2361,"The amount of meat that is produced from grazing is very small. The number of chickens and pigs grazing is negligible out of the total number of these animals slaughtered. Cattle are the only animals that are grazing in any significant quantity. Of these, cattle still only graze for about half of their lives before being sent to a feedlot where they are fattened up for slaughter. 

The benefits of grazing are small, and the costs are large. Currently the federal government in the United States (and many other countries) has programs that kill animals on public lands if they compete with grazing cattle for food or if they are potential predators of cattle. Public lands are also offered for grazing at hugely subsidized rates (although even at these rates we’ve seen with the Bundy case in Nevada that some ranchers still refuse to pay this fraction of their share). Finally, cattle create a large amount of environmental damage to these lands and the manure pollutes waterways (Wyoming passed their state’s ag-gag law to prevent environmental groups from gathering data on the water pollution being created by grazing cattle). 

Raising cattle for meat is significantly less efficient than raising chickens and pigs, which are themselves significantly less efficient than growing crops. Crops are being grown to feed to cattle for the time they spend in feedlots, and even if this is only a fraction of their lives, it still requires more crops to be grown than we get back in edible material after the cattle are slaughtered, so if we stopped farming cattle we wouldn’t need to grow as many crops.

But wait, there’s more! A great deal of the land on which livestock are grazing is already perfectly arable land! [91% of the land cleared in the Amazon since 1970 has been cleared for cattle ranching](http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/02/02/000090341_20040202130625/Rendered/PDF/277150PAPER0wbwp0no1022.pdf). Another common excuse for grazing is that land is too hilly for growing crops, but the technology to make hilly land arable has existed for millennia. It is called terracing, and it is successfully used all over the world.

Finally, agriculture isn’t the only use for land. Humans can use land for any purpose (recreation, maintaining clean watersheds, development, etc.) Furthermore, the value derived from an area shouldn’t be limited to just the value that it provides to humans.

2362,"Ultimately ethical veganism is a boycott intended to lessen the demand for animal products. Other animals do not possess all of the capacities that a typical human would have, but they show responses that appear quite similar to our own reactions to suffering when treated in many of the ways that would cause us to suffer.

[Utilitarianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) is a common school of ethical thought amongst vegans. Utilitarians view an action as good if it maximizes the amount of goodness (generally judged as increasing pleasure or happiness, and minimizing pain or suffering) that is expected to occur as a result. While many ethical vegans will openly admit that they enjoy the taste of meat (evidenced by the numerous meat alternatives available for vegans today), they recognize that the harm caused to other animals to produce these products almost certainly exceeds the pleasure they gain as a result. The boycott that is veganism lessens demand for these products, and correspondingly supply will decrease as a result.

Another way of expressing this is in the principle of [equal consideration of interests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_consideration_of_interests). That is to say that the interest of any individual should be given equal consideration where, and to the extent that the interest exists. This isn't to say that all interests are equal, experienced equally, or that all animals possess interests, but that where there are interests, we should weight that interest proportionally to the intensity of the interest and not discriminate on any other basis.",2016-04-05 23:29:25+00:00,d1rejv3,1.0,t3_4diq9i,5596.0,AskReddit

They are able to succeed in their fear-mongering because there are grains of truth to what they are spreading. Soy does contain phytoestrogens genestein and daidzein. Phytoestrogens also exist in all kinds of other foods that people consume every day. They are simply compounds that weakly bond to human estrogen receptors creating a weak positive or negative estrogenic effect. The impact is far smaller than you would see from the actual mammalian hormones consumed in meat or dairy products, and a great body of research has found that the overall impact of phytoestrogens in our diets is fairly negligible. 

Soy also does contain phytic acid, which decreases the rate at which your body absorbs minerals like calcium and iron. The thing is absorption of nutrients is a complex issue, and any food that is more complex than pure sugar or pure table salt will contain some compounds that both increase and decrease the absorption of certain nutrients.

The French have already discovered that the blackness of the skin is no reason why a human being should be abandoned without redress to the caprice of a tormentor. It may come one day to be recognized, that the number of the legs, the villosity of the skin, or the termination of the os sacrum, are reasons equally insufficient for abandoning a sensitive being to the same fate. What else is it that should trace the insuperable line? Is it the faculty of reason, or, perhaps, the faculty of discourse? But a full-grown horse or dog is beyond comparison a more rational, as well as a more conversable animal, than an infant of a day, or a week, or even a month, old. But suppose the case were otherwise, what would it avail? the question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?

2427,"Dairy cows, like all mammals only produce significant amounts of milk for a limited period of time after giving birth. It is standard practice on dairy farms to stop milking the dairy cows after about 305 days.

&gt;Production levels peak at around 40 to 60 days after calving.[16] The cow is then bred. Production declines steadily afterwards, until, at about 305 days after calving, the cow is 'dried off', and milking ceases. About sixty days later, one year after the birth of her previous calf, a cow will calve again. High production cows are more difficult to breed at a one-year interval. Many farms take the view that 13 or even 14 month cycles are more appropriate for this type of cow.

Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

The reason why vegetarian and vegan diets offer health benefits is very likely because they encourage people to adopt healthier eating patterns that are higher in fiber and lower in saturated fats.

Genetically modified foods are undoubtedly safe, and this is recognized by the vast majority of the scientific community. It is possible to breed things into plants that could pose a health risk, but this is similarly true of conventional breeding techniques as it is of genetic modification.

Sugars increase risk of diabetes and obesity and there is benefit to reducing our consumption of them and increasing consumption of foods that are higher in fiber and carbohydrates that do not cause a spike in blood sugar. 

Diets that recommend severely reducing consumption of a particular macronutrient (carbohydrates, fat, or protein) often succeed in helping people lose weight because they are reducing their caloric intake as a result of the restriction, but placing such restrictions on one’s diet can increase risk of not meeting other nutritional needs if not planned appropriately.",2016-04-01 23:51:20+00:00,d1mft0w,1.0,t3_4cyoos,3306.0,explainlikeimfive

&gt;Wield common sense and insight in choosing a course of action,
&gt;By extension of the above, recognize said course of action as a cause and predict its effects in detail.

Many other primates, social species of birds, and even rats will act altruistically toward other individuals. Rats who have been trained to press a lever for a reward will stop pressing the lever if they see that it causes another rat to receive an electric shock, and they when presented with a treat and another rat who is trapped in a clearly distressful situation, they will help the other rat escape first even though it means they will have to share the treat. There is clearly some sense in which they feel actions are right or wrong and they act accordingly. All of these species are capable of anticipating the effects of actions and choosing a course of action accordingly.

At the same time, infants, the severely mentally handicapped, and some people near the end of life do not possess all of these qualities.

2652,"&gt;If you want to keep this from happening at all, you're back to the hermetically sealed greenhouse plan for agriculture, which is itself not a good long-term plan.

Vegans aren't trying to keep a hermetically sealed landscape to prevent any animals from coming into contact with crops. They are trying to prevent animals from being exploited and denied life and liberty as a result of being used for relatively menial human preferences.

&gt;Also, you can add manure at the opening of your season and plant the same season. Planting nitrogen fixers means you have a minimum of a season's growth to get any nitrogen. Again - efficiency in your cycle. You can check into this - the figures on fixing rates (lower at altitude, by the way, because of shorter growing seasons and lower partial vapor pressure of nitrogen) are publicly available for a wide variety of crops, as are typical nitrogen densities per various forms of manure.

It isn't just a wasted growing cycle. You're actually growing things during this time! These fields are producing a valuable product.

&gt;As for the protein density of beans, in principle you're not wrong, but it's more complicated than that. What you really need aren't proteins so much as amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) and beans are not a complete protein source (the level to which they provide protein is dependent upon variety) and here we get to the agronomic problem of growing enough of the right kind of crops to feed the people of the world enough of the right kind of amino acids to prevent outright starvation.

If beans were the only source of protein someone was consuming then they would need to eat moderately more beans to get the same amount of whatever amino acid they were lacking, but luckily people eat a variety of foods that have different ratios of amino acids. It is much, much more efficient in terms of land, water use, and fertilizer input to grow crops directly than it is to grow crops to feed to animals and then slaughter those animals for food.

Finally, regardless of what your responses to these points may be in the theoretical vegan world that you have defined to justify your desired conclusion, the fact of the matter is that in the world we live in right now the problem that we have is [too much manure](http://www.dw.com/en/loss-of-fertile-soils-a-food-security-risk/a-18395856) that is degrading soil. In the world as it exists right now we need to reduce our consumption of animal products to improve soil quality.

&gt;""[Animal waste] is the root of considerable environmental problems in Germany, particularly in regions with intensive livestock farming,"" explained agrarian economist Knut Ehlers of the German Environment Agency.

&gt;Although manure is also a fertilizer, too much is toxic for soil and water. The environmental impacts of factory farming ultimately fall on the taxpayer. Such agriculture is unsustainable.

&gt;Building more sustainable agricultural practices benefits not only the environment, but also human health, said Swiss agriculture and development expert Han Herren. Recognized with the Alternative Nobel Prize Right Livelihood Award in 2013, Herren proposed that a variety of foods be cultivated.

&gt;""That would mean more and better crop rotation, resulting in fewer soil diseases, more microorganisms in the soil - and therefore healthier soil.""

I'd be happy to let you continue this dialogue elsewhere. I suggest /r/vegan if you are trying to make a point about veganism.

Peter Singer is the most famous face of contemporary utilitarianism (and arguably all of contemporary philosophy). He built his reputation on works promoting animal rights.

2715,"&gt; Your binary question seems to imply that the following statements can be accurately and quantitatively compared. Once you have listed the 2 options we have to choose from (other than the false dilemma) there is also another fallacy.

If you look at my other comments you’ll see that I’ve already stated elsewhere that there could be other options that are better than feeding a cat a vegan diet. I’m only defending the position that feeding a cat a vegan diet is better than feeding a cat a typical non-vegan cat food, and more generally that causing less harm to animals is better than causing more harm.

&gt; Appeal to Consequences. Surely the second option is bad, therefore the first option must be the good one.

An [appeal to consequences]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_consequences) is a fallacious argument that something is true because good things will follow if it were to be true. It isn’t a refutation of all consequentialist philosophy, which argues that we ought to behave in ways that have good consequences.

&gt; I take issue with the way you also threw around the definite death of animals as a direct result of the cat food. Are there animal products in cat food? Yes. Were those animals killed for cat food? Absolutely, overwhelmingly no. Your statement is written in a way that implies that the alternative to putting an animal's health at risk is killing many animals and that is not a true statement no matter how you slice it.


Animal agriculture is not an inelastic industry. If suppliers can get less money for their products then supply will drop. More harm to animals is caused by feeding a cat a **typical** non-vegan cat food than is caused by feeding a cat a vegan diet.

&gt;What ethical standard/theory/mentality actually supports your statement that putting an animal's health at risk is ethically justifiable if you (and I will just be charitable here and simply assume your second option to be true) avoid killing other animals? ~~What black and white, two-dimentional, kindergarten world do you live in that those statements by themselves much less their conclusion is not hugely controversial?~~

Ethics is a field that helps us to decide what to do when conflicting interests come into conflict with one another. Are you familiar with the classic [trolley problem]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem)? It discusses whether it is ethically justifiable to put some lives at risk (or to certainly kill some) in order to save a greater number of lives. A large majority of people agree that in at least some scenarios it is ethically justifiable, and arguably an ethical obligation to save the greater number.

Individual animals are capable of caring about how they are treated, and our obligation should be to treat the individuals respectfully. If a population decreases while the individuals are still treated well then this is not an ethical issue. For example the population of some European countries has started to decline due to lower birth rates, but if we were to breed a population of humans to be exploited for others' benefit, it would raise their population, but it wouldn't be ethical.

&gt; I'm just trying to understand your reasoning here, it doesn't make much sense to view it from an ethical perspective to me (it does make sense from an environmental perspective of consuming less resources to produce meat).

The only reasons I can see for not treating this as an ethical issue are fears over the scale of the issue (not a good excuse to ignore the issue or do nothing) and appeals to nature (not a good justification either).

If we’re going to share recipes we should find the largest Facebook groups for sharing recipes and share them there. We have delicious recipes that can go viral in any group when presented well.

There are a few examples of vegans who effectively target content that will resonate with large non-vegan audiences, but make sure you understand what they are doing successfully before you invest too much effort into a project.

Finally, if there is more effective activism that we can be doing that doesn’t appeal to us as introverts, we shouldn’t let our introversion be an excuse to do less than we can.

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

&gt; It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

&gt; A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

&gt; With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

&gt; A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

&gt; Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

&gt; Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

&gt; Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

&gt;  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

&gt; It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

&gt; Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

2962,"I chose to go vegan for animal rights reasons almost eight years ago. I admittedly enjoyed the taste of meat as much as anyone I know, and I grew up with this being a significant part of my diet. However, over time I began to question whether the convenience and enjoyment I was getting out of eating meat was sufficient to justify the things that necessarily had to occur to other animals in order for that meat to be produced.

Vegans are often portrayed as believing that other animals ought to be treated as being equal to people (an understandable belief given some frequently repeated quotes from Ingrid Newkirk of PETA). Other animals aren’t the same as you or I, and they do not require all of the same rights. Nonetheless, there is little doubt that there are many other animals who possess intelligence and other capacities beyond those of some humans who we would deem worthy of a higher level of consideration (for example young children, the severely mentally handicapped, or senile elderly individuals). While other animals do not possess interests to the same extent as the typical human, to the extent and degree that other animals do possess interests, I believe we ought to give [commensurate consideration to their interests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_consideration_of_interests) as we would to interests of a similar degree that are possessed by humans, and we should not discriminate on any other basis.

Many people point out that animals are still killed in the production of vegan foods as well as numerous other aspects of modern life. It is entirely true that adopting a vegan diet isn’t a solution to all of the world’s problems, or even all the ills that befall other animals as a result of our actions. Nonetheless, becoming vegan is an important way to significantly reduce the amount of harm that we cause to other animals.",2016-02-20 19:38:01+00:00,d07b7v5,1.0,t3_46rcri,3279.0,AskReddit

**Ingredients**

* 1 small spaghetti squash
* 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
* Salt and pepper
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)
* 2 cups broccoli florets
* ½ cup vegetable stock
* 1 cup cannellini beans, rinsed, drained, and roughly mashed with a fork
* ⅓ cup nutritional yeast

**Preparation**

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F and line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Cut about half an inch off of the top and bottom of the spaghetti squash, and discard those pieces. Cut the squash crosswise into rings about 1-inch thick, and run your knife around the inside of the rings to cut the seeds out. Drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil over the baking sheet, then spread the squash rings over it, moving them around a little so that the undersides are evenly coated with a little bit of oil. Season with salt and pepper, then flip the rings over and season again. Roast in the preheated oven until the squash is tender, about 30 minutes. When the squash is done, set it aside on the counter while you cook the other vegetables. It’ll be easier to handle if you let it cool for 10 minutes before taking it apart.
3. Heat the remaining olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes (if using), season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring, just until the garlic is fragrant, about a minute. Add the broccoli and vegetable stock and turn the heat down to medium low. Season with a little more salt and pepper, and cook until the broccoli is bright green and al dente and the vegetable stock has reduced to about half. Add the nutritional yeast and stir everything together, so that the yeast and the remaining stock make a sauce. If the sauce is super thick and clumpy, add more stock or water, a tablespoon at a time, until it’s thick but still a little runny. Add the cooked squash and toss everything together, then divide into two bowls and serve immediately.

Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

&gt; With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

&gt; A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

&gt; Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

&gt; Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

&gt; Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

&gt;  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

&gt; Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

&gt; Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

3060,"&gt; I don't believe people should be shamed into doing something they don't want to do. Everyone is entitled to their beliefs, but there's nothing inherently wrong with consuming animal products. 

People who are doing something that is causing harm to others should be told that it isn’t okay to keep doing that thing. Consuming animal products causes animals to suffer and it has a huge environmental footprint exacerbating many human issues as well. 

Caring about animal rights is not a “fad diet”. Your paragraph about that betrays a severe lack of understanding about what it means to be vegan.

&gt; And just to address the topic of any unusual diet for children, especially young children, I hope that those parents fully inform themselves from unbiased and independent sources.

I do hope that all parents inform themselves about what is healthy for their children and rely upon sources like the ones I cited above.

3062,"&gt;Hunting is currently a necessity, otherwise deer would overpopulate and starve in mass numbers. With that said, I don't really approve of overfarming beef. It's a little more complicated than deciding that killing any animal is wrong.

This is completely a myth. Around the world species are being hunted to extinction. Even with species like deer there are laws set up designed to maximize the number and size of deer that people can kill, and not to encourage keeping population numbers under control. Laws encourage hunting of what would otherwise be deer predators. Laws prevent killing young deer, deer who are pregnant, or deer caring for offspring. 

There are jurisdictions that have taken a more compassionate approach to managing animal population numbers by using birth control rather than allowing inexperienced gunslingers to try to kill individuals with a bullet.",2016-02-10 19:51:22+00:00,czv4d4x,2.0,t1_czv1gx9,3988.0,truewomensliberation

Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

&gt; Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

&gt; Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

&gt; Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

&gt; Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

&gt;  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

The third pamphlet was significantly more successful in getting people to reduce their energy consumption than the first two. People respond really well if they hear that the people around them are already doing something.

3232,"This is unnecessary drama and in-fighting within the animal rights movement. If you don’t like DxE, don’t participate in their actions. Get involved in other animal rights activism. Help other activists be more effective with their activism, but don’t focus on sabotaging the efforts of other animal rights groups.

I participated with DxE very early on in the organization’s history. I was not sure whether the actions DxE was taking were having a significant positive influence, so I focused my efforts elsewhere. Contrary to the article’s claims my experience with the organization was that it was democratic to a fault. We had a situation where we had 12 hours after an action to get an article written to be published in a newspaper. We had two articles written and the organization debated throughout the night on which one should be submitted, and a vote was held in the wee hours of the morning.  It was a situation that required executive leadership, not the extensive democratic process that it received, yet Wayne refused to let his views be treated as more important than any other member of the organization.  

DxE’s members took issues of human injustice very seriously while I was there. Discussions of race, gender equality, and other forms of disadvantage and social power were approached carefully and thoughtfully. However, the group also was one that attracted some people with strongly held beliefs on these matters that I could easily see as being unsatisfied with being on the minority side of one of DxE’s democratic processes. I see that one of the examples of DxE’s alleged racism in the article is that they portrayed a pig hanging next to a human being hung. By this standard many of Vegan Sidekick’s comics could also be considered “racist”.

Unfortunately, many people don’t have the experience with DxE that I do. The group isn’t perfect, but it is filled with dedicated animal rights activists who are also genuinely good people working hard to make the world a better place. I’m not encouraging anyone to get involved with the group, but let’s not focus our efforts on creating this unnecessary friction within the animal rights movement. We have plenty of hatred and criticism that we already have to face elsewhere.",2016-01-26 00:02:09+00:00,czbvkto,1.0,t3_42ofyx,2386.0,vegan

3242,"&gt;There is no rational thought process that would lead me to believe that there is a reason to be a vegan. There is no rational reason to care about your food ""suffering"". There is no rational reason to believe that eating meat is bad for you. There is no rational reason to believe that eating meat is bad for the environment, or any worse than eating vegetables. There is no rational reason to eat supplements because you are denying your body of what it needs to live biologically. 

There is no rational reason for you to conclude that there is no rational reason for these things. 

Many other animals do suffer, including the ones raised for food. Why would we ignore the suffering of any creature capable of experiencing such an emotion? 

Diets high in meat do lead to higher rates of heart disease and certain meats do increase the risk of cancer. 

Producing meat will always come with a larger environmental footprint than producing similar amounts of plant-based foods, because animals don’t grow on trees. Any calories or protein that ends up in an animal is there because the animal consumed plants. 

You consume salt supplemented with iodine. You consume flour that has been enriched (supplemented) with vitamins and minerals. [The CDC]( http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/folicacid/faqs.html) recommends that all women who are pregnant or may become pregnant take a folic acid supplement. Supplements have reduced the rates of birth defects and greatly improved public health. Those sound like rational reasons.

What does not sound rational is this lengthy tirade that denies the abundant evidence that contradicts your views. This level of denial is one that I have only seen from religious zealots who deny the evidence for evolution or who try to deny the evidence for climate change.",2016-01-25 18:14:51+00:00,czbguw3,1.0,t3_42mnv2,1442.0,copypasta

3249,"No experiments have shown that plants feel pain. What experiment could hypothetically be done with our present understanding of feeling pain that could possibly show that?

What studies have found is that plants react to stimuli. A rock reacts to being kicked. Vinegar reacts to baking soda. My computer reacts to my hitting the keys. 

However, the media loves sensationalizing scientific discoveries, so it is quite common when research on plant reactions comes out for it to be trumped up as ""proof"" that plants feel pain. 

Nonetheless, even if it was the case that plants do feel pain, the ethical thing to do would still be to eat plants.

Good people speak up when they see something wrong happening. They will say something when people are doing something that harms other individuals. People are going to feel insulted when they get confronted about the fact that something they are doing is wrong. There is some level of tact that people can use to minimize this, but to some extent the reaction of people being confronted is unavoidable.

3272,"On top of this, no matter how nicely a farm treats their chickens and cows (which you’re right, treating animals nicely often doesn’t line up with what is most profitable), male chickens will not lay any eggs and male cattle will not produce any milk.

Egg laying hens are a much smaller and slower growing breed than the broiler chickens that are raised to be slaughtered for meat. Male chicks of the egg laying breed are typically killed shortly after birth by either grinding them up alive, gassing them, or simply tossing them into trash bags to suffocate.

Most people don’t realize that cows are like all other mammals in that they only produce significant amounts of milk for a period of time after having a calf. They will be repeatedly impregnated over the course of their lives to keep them producing. Mother cows have a strong bond with their calves, but the calves are typically taken away from their mothers shortly after birth since it isn’t profitable for the calves to be drinking their mother’s milk. Male calves are generally not raised to adulthood either. They are typically slaughtered at a few weeks of age to be sold as veal. 

Finally, the period for which an egg laying hen and a dairy cow produce a profitable amount of eggs or milk is only a fraction of their natural life spans. Farms do not keep these animals alive to be charitable. When it is no longer profitable the dairy cows and egg laying hens will be sent to slaughter.",2016-01-21 19:46:51+00:00,cz6v9q0,2.0,t1_cz6tmi0,2213.0,NoStupidQuestions

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

&gt; Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

&gt; Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

3331,"Ultimately ethical veganism is a boycott intended to lessen the demand for animal products. Other animals do not possess all of the capacities that a typical human would have, but they show responses that appear quite similar to our own reactions to suffering when treated in many of the ways that would cause us to suffer.

[Utilitarianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) is a common school of ethical thought amongst vegans. Utilitarians view an action as good if it maximizes the amount of goodness (generally judged as increasing pleasure or happiness, and minimizing pain or suffering) that is expected to occur as a result. While many ethical vegans will openly admit that they enjoy the taste of meat (evidenced by the numerous meat alternatives available for vegans today), they recognize that the harm caused to other animals to produce these products almost certainly exceeds the pleasure they gain as a result. The boycott that is veganism lessens demand for these products, and correspondingly supply will decrease as a result.

Another way of expressing this is in the principle of [equal consideration of interests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_consideration_of_interests). That is to say that the interest of any individual should be given equal consideration where, and to the extent that the interest exists. This isn't to say that all interests are equal, experienced equally, or that all animals possess interests, but that where there are interests, we should weight that interest proportionally to the intensity of the interest and not discriminate on any other basis.",2016-01-14 19:08:07+00:00,cyy8b7n,2.0,t1_cyy6o26,2155.0,vegan

1. Place the chickpeas, onion, garlic, spinach and parsley in a food processor and pulse until pasty and combined (or use a stick blender if you don’t have a food processor like me)
2. Mix the cumin, coriander, salt, flour, baking powder and soda in a large bowl then add the mushed up chickpea and spinach mixture. Mix well with a wooden spoon, making sure there are no dry patches left
3. Stir in the breadcrumbs. If the mixture seems to dry add up to 2 more tablespoons of breadcrumbs and mix well. Use the falafel mixture immediately.
4. To make the falafel, heat 3 inches of oil in a pan. Take a walnut sized lump of the falafel mixture, and using two spoons shape into balls and gently drop into the hot oil. Cook each falafel for about 5 minutes until browned. Keep going until all the falafel mixture is used up
5. Enjoy inside a salad filled pita bread topped with tahini dressing.

People become vegan for three main reasons. First, there are likely health benefits to reducing one's consumption of animal products while continuing to eat a well-planned diet (see statements from dietetic organizations above). Consuming animal products also has a disproportionately large footprint on our environment, and people want to reduce the harm they cause. 

Finally, people recognize that many other animals are subjects of their own lives with preferences and desires to live just like you or I. Just because an individual belongs to a different species from yourself does not make it ethically defensible to harm them.

&gt;Production levels peak at around 40 to 60 days after calving. The cow is then bred. Production declines steadily afterwards, until, at about 305 days after calving, the cow is 'dried off', and milking ceases. About sixty days later, one year after the birth of her previous calf, a cow will calve again. High production cows are more difficult to breed at a one-year interval. Many farms take the view that 13 or even 14 month cycles are more appropriate for this type of cow.

One thing I always try to put some thought into when doing activism is how I can quantify the impact I am having. If I’m sharing something online I try to get feedback on the number of views and “likes,” and I’ll pay attention to what people are saying in the comments. If I’m doing activism in real life I will keep track of the number of people being reached, and I’ll try to get feedback to see how people are reacting. With this information in hand I’ll spend less time in the future on less effective activism, and I will further try to hone and improve upon the activism that is working.

In 2015 I have also donated 20% of my salary to charity. This is broken down as follows:

* Mercy For Animals – 50% 
* The Humane League – 25%
* Animal Charity Evaluators – 17%
* Animal Equality – 8%

This almost certainly includes many, but not all animals. Sponges, for example, are members of kingdom animalia, but they do not possess any nervous system, so it seems highly unlikely that they are capable of caring about how they are treated. Oysters possess a very limited nervous system, and it also seems unlikely that they have more than very weak interests regarding their treatment. On the other hand, the octopus is an invertebrate animal that does possess a highly developed nervous system and complex behavior that would suggest a high level of sophistication.

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

&gt; It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

&gt; A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

&gt; With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

&gt; A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

&gt; Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

&gt; Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

&gt; Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

Ultimately, people should weigh the evidence and make the best decision that they can, not simply throw up their hands when then can't know something definitively.

With regard to the cows, there is suffering that happens in growing crops like corn too. Corn makes up a substantial portion of feed that is given to cattle. It takes a lot more corn to feed to cattle then slaughter the cattle and get a certain number of calories back then it does to simply eat corn directly for those calories.

3545,"&gt; What if I live in an area with a water shortage and decide to buy a fish - is it cool if I just don't give him as much water as he needs?

If you were going to cause more suffering by taking that water from others than you are going to cause to the fish by limiting its water than I certainly hope that you would choose the option that causes less suffering. That seems like an implausible and unlikely scenario, but you shouldn’t think your responsibilities stop at the edge of the fish bowl. Of course you should make reasonable effort to minimize the suffering you cause to the fish as well even in such a situation.

&gt; Everything you're doing, all day long, is having an impact on someone or something somewhere.

I try to make reasonable effort to minimize the harm that all of my actions cause. I hope you don’t just think to yourself. “Lots of bad things happen in the world, so I shouldn’t trouble myself with any of them.” In fact, I know you don’t, because you seem to care deeply about this issue of cats’ diets. I think the only point on which we disagree is that I think you should look at all the consequences of your actions and not just the immediate consequences to the animal in front of you.

&gt; Again, if you aren't willing to give an animal what it needs, then don't fucking get it. The argument should not even need to progress past that point.

3547,"I’m not arguing that we should create new rules preventing people from doing anything in my comment. I’m arguing that we should see it as better to cause less suffering and death than it is to cause more suffering and death. Furthermore, when you look at all the consequences of feeding a cat a meat-heavy diet versus a vegan diet, the vegan diet almost certainly causes substantially less suffering and death.

Why should the focus not be solely on the cat? Because the cat isn’t the only individual being impacted by your action. If your choice to feed a cat a certain diet harms other beings besides just the cat then we need to take that harm into consideration as well. The harm to the animals who are slaughtered to become cat food needs to enter into the equation.

I’m not surprised that this concept might lead you to ask other questions about the larger conclusions that we should draw from it. When it comes to euthanizing all cats though, I think the potential for larger unforeseen ecological consequences from such an action should at least cause someone to seriously hesitate and seek out much better information before supporting such an action.",2015-12-28 20:12:52+00:00,cye4mzv,3.0,t1_cye3xrb,1104.0,AdviceAnimals
3548,"One animal suffering and dying is awful, but here’s what I don’t get: People who are outraged over one animal’s suffering and death, but their solution to that is to cause many animals to suffer in terrible conditions (the animals who become pet food aren’t treated well), and be slaughtered to keep that one animal alive. I think almost everyone agrees that when presented with a choice where some suffering and death is going to occur, we should still try to minimize the amount that does occur. 

I know what people are going to say to this: “It is natural. Cats eat meat in nature.” While that is true, no intelligent person believes that something is good just because it is natural. I hope most redditors are aware of the appeal to nature fallacy. Here is a situation where we are presented with a choice on what to do, and we shouldn’t choose to cause more harm just because nature would. 

Others will simply say: “If you don’t want to feed a cat meat then don’t get a cat.” While I have no desire to get a cat, there are others who have cats in their lives, and while they may very well be concerned about the risks a diet may present to their cat, they also recognize the much greater suffering that will be caused by the status quo.

* 1 tsp lemon juice
* 2-4 cloves of garlic
* 1 tsp salt
* 12 oz fettuccine pasta

**Directions**

1. Boil 4 cups of water in a small pot.

Your share in the meat industry is probably about 1/7,000,000,000^th of the total problem. You're not going to be able to solve all the suffering that is inflicted upon non-human animals just with your change, but your individual share still amounts to dozens of animals' lives each year. One powerful quote I've heard is:

&gt;Saving one animal won't change the world, but it will change the world for that one animal.

Consuming eggs and dairy still causes animals to suffer and die. Conditions in the egg and dairy industries are abysmal, but even in the best facilities suffering and death is inevitable if a producer is looking to make a profit. Cows do not produce significant amounts of milk unless they have had a calf recently, and male calves will never produce milk. Veal is an inevitable byproduct of the dairy industry.

Similarly, male chicks will never lay eggs. Male chicks of egg laying breeds are routinely ground up shortly after birth or simply tossed in the trash to suffocate.

For both dairy and eggs, the animals who produce these products do not continue to produce at the same level as they age. Egg laying hens are commonly slaughtered at 1-2 years of age, and dairy cows will make it to 4-5 years of age. This is a small fraction of their natural lifespan for each. When their production drops they are sent to slaughter.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

&gt; Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

&gt; Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

&gt; Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

&gt;  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

3608,"Large facilities that raise animals for food have an incentive to make sure that as many animals as possible reach as large of a weight as possible in as short of time as possible. This is not the same thing as making sure their animals are comfortable and healthy, and certainly not the same as prioritizing their wellbeing as individuals. 

In large pig operations one particularly egregious example of this is the need for tail docking. Farms find it cheaper to keep animals in fairly tight quarters with little mental stimulation (often not even dirt on the ground). The pigs in these conditions will bite on one another’s tails, and with no opportunity to escape those around them tail biting can easily lead to extensive damage and dangerous infections. To combat this problem nearly every one of these large pig facilities will cut off the pigs’ tails. This isn’t done because the farmers care about the pigs’ wellbeing it is done because it allows the farmers to cut costs and maximize profit.

In the cattle industry this can be seen from the use of CAFOs to fatten animals up for slaughter. Cattle aren’t happier on CAFOs than they are grazing. It is done because it is cheap and expeditious. It can be seen in the practice of dehorning of cattle. Cattle do not benefit from the lack of horns, but it does make things easier for the farmer. 

In the egg industry chickens are kept in cages because it is cheap and allows for easy gathering of eggs. Unfortunately birds kept like this will peck at each other relentlessly, so the animals have their beaks trimmed to the point where it becomes so painful to peck at one another that their instinct is overcome. This shows no concern for the wellbeing of an individual. Profit is once again shamefully prioritized over the rights of the individual in these cruel systems.",2015-12-21 20:57:28+00:00,cy6zlfg,8.0,t1_cy6vraj,5691.0,skeptic

**Soba**

* 6 ounces soba noodles
* 2 cups frozen organic edamame
* 10 ounces (about 3 cups) sugar snap peas or snow peas
* 6 medium-sized carrots, peeled
* ½ cup chopped fresh cilantro (about 2 handfuls)
* ¼ cup sesame seeds

**Ginger-sesame sauce**

* ¼ cup reduced-sodium tamari or soy sauce
* 2 tablespoons quality peanut oil or extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 small lime, juiced
* 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
* 1 tablespoon agave nectar
* 1 tablespoon white miso
* 2 teaspoons freshly grated ginger
* 1 teaspoon chili garlic sauce or sriracha

###Instructions

1. To prepare the vegetables: Use a chef's knife to slice the peas in half lengthwise (or just roughly chop them). Slice the carrots into long, thin strips with a julienne peeler, or slice them into ribbons with a vegetable peeler.

2. To make the sauce: whisk together the ingredients in a small bowl until emulsified. Set aside.

3. Bring two big pots of water to a boil. In the meantime, toast the sesame seeds: Pour the sesame seeds into a small pan. Toast for about 4 to 5 minutes over medium-low heat, shaking the pan frequently to prevent burning, until the seeds are turning golden and starting to make popping noises.

4. Once the pots of water are boiling: In one pot, cook the soba noodles just until al dente, according to package directions (probably about 5 minutes), then drain and briefly rinse under cool water. Cook the frozen edamame in the other pot until warmed through (about 4 to 6 minutes) but before draining, toss the halved peas into the boiling edamame water and cook for an additional 20 seconds. Drain.

5. Combine the soba noodles, edamame, snap peas and carrots in a large serving bowl. Pour in the dressing and toss with salad servers. Toss in the chopped cilantro and toasted sesame seeds. Serve.

&gt; It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

&gt; A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

&gt; With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

&gt; A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

&gt; Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

&gt; Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

&gt; Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein

Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day.

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

&gt; It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

&gt; Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

&gt; Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein

Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

3765,"I am a utilitarian, and while I don’t take a rights based approach to ethics I still consider myself to be someone who cares about animal rights. As /u/sweet__leaf points out, the term animal welfare is generally used to refer to practices that may keep animals in better health and provide them with some level of mental stimulation, but still ultimately view it as acceptable to take the lives of animals for minor human preferences or deprive animals of a great deal of liberty for relatively minor human benefit. The term animal rights has often been used in contrast to this to refer to views that place animal interests on a more level playing field with human interests, even if the philosophy behind it isn’t a rights-based philosophy. This is why Peter Singer’s book Animal Liberation, which approaches animal rights from a utilitarian perspective, is commonly referred to as kicking off the modern animal rights movement.

I do see how using the term “rights” to refer to individuals who don’t use a rights based approach to ethics can be confusing, but I also think there is some benefit in being able to use the term broadly to include individuals with different ethical approaches in a wider animal rights movement that shares many common goals.",2015-12-10 22:55:25+00:00,cxuo209,5.0,t1_cxumsei,1925.0,vegan

3781,"&gt;Hmm but what about the pesticides and fertilizers needed to grow those crops? Are you suggesting we should switch to an all vegan, organic diet? I do not see globalized veganism without the usage of pesticides and fertilizers, and hell even GMO's we all love to hate. If we are going to do veganism, then we would need a drastic shift in crop production mechanisms. Our current large farm are based on monocultures, not permacultures. 

Why would shifting to veganism force us to address these other agricultural issues any more than the current system does? We don't need to abandon conventional agriculture just because we aren't over producing animal products. 

&gt;I was lucky to work in agronomy for a few years and up here, past the 49th parallel, we can grow Wheat, Barley, and Canola really well, beyond that we grow some Potatoes, Corn, Soy, and Sugar Beets. Sure there are some small scale farms and greenhouses that produce other types of produce throughout the year, but on a very small, regional scale. How is my city suppose to feed itself without using a global market? 

Large cities that far from the equator cannot support themselves without a global market. Producing animal products does not change that. 

&gt;Say we switch to veganism, what do we do with all those cows and chickens and pigs? Just let them run free? Wouldn't they then disrupt any ecosystem they are ""released"" into?

The world doesn't change its behavior overnight. The animals that are on farms today will be slaughtered, but as demand drops fewer animals will be bred to replace them.",2015-12-10 08:01:29+00:00,cxtw881,4.0,t1_cxtw05t,751.0,environmental_science

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

&gt; It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

&gt; A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

&gt; With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

&gt; A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

&gt; Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

&gt; Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

&gt; Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

* 2 shallots
* 4 cloves of garlic
* 350g mixed wild mushrooms
* 400g closed cup or chestnut mushrooms
* 1/2 bunch of fresh thyme
* 350g stale bread
* 100g pecans or hazelnuts
* 1 bunch of fresh flat-leaf parsley
* 25g dried porcini
* 80ml olive oil
* 2 fresh bay leaves

**Instructions**

1. Peel and finely chop the shallots and garlic, and roughly chop all the fresh mushrooms. Pick the thyme leaves and tear the stale bread into small chunks.

2. Lightly toast the nuts in a dry frying pan, then roughly chop. Pick and roughly chop the parsley.

3. Cover the porcini with 300ml of boiling water and leave aside to rehydrate.

4. Heat the oil in a large, wide pan and add the shallot and garlic. Cook over a medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 5 to 8 minutes or until the shallot is softened but not coloured. 

5. Drain the soaked porcini over a bowl, reserving the liquid. Add these and the rest of the mushrooms to the pan along with the bay and thyme leaves and cook until all the mushrooms are well softened. If they release a lot of liquid, pour it onto the diced bread and carry on cooking. 

6. When the mushrooms are tender and browned, tip the mixture into a large bowl and leave to cool completely. 

7. Preheat the oven to 190ºC/gas 5. 

8. Once the cooked mushroom mixture has cooled, add the chunks of bread, a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper, the pecans or hazelnuts and about half of the porcini’s reserved soaking liquid (make sure you pour it through a sieve first to stop any grit getting through). Combine well. If the stuffing seems too dry, just add a little more of the reserved porcini liquid. 

9. Add most of the parsley and stir it through then tip the stuffing into a lightly greased baking dish of approximately 20cm x 25cm and cover with foil. 

10. Place in the oven and bake for 35 minutes, then remove the foil and cook for a further 10 minutes. Scatter over the rest of the chopped parsley before serving.

I enjoyed the taste of meat growing up as much as anyone I knew, but I have found an abundance of new foods that I love now that I’m vegan. I wouldn’t really say that I miss meat.

Many of the people working to make lab-grown meat a commercially viable reality are vegan. It has huge potential to reduce the suffering of animals, but it will likely face much of the same resistance that many of the delicious meat alternatives that are already available currently face. As long as these products are produced without harming animals then they will be perfectly vegan. ",2015-12-07 18:40:23+00:00,cxqixor,1.0,t3_3vtaoi,4015.0,vegan

3817,"###Ingredients

**Burgers**

* 1 cup raw beets (about 1 or 2 large), peeled and shredded or finely chopped – $1.13
* 3/4 cup eggplant, cubed and lightly steamed until fork-tender (not peeled) – $0.75
* 1/2 cup quinoa, cooked – $0.62
* 1/2 15-ounce can chickpeas – $0.40
* 1 “flax egg” (1 tablespoon flax seed meal whisked with 3 tablespoons warm water) – $0.08
* 1/2 tablespoon smoked paprika (optional, or your favorite spices)
* A squeeze of lemon juice (optional)
* Salt and pepper to taste

Total Cost Per Serving (5 burger patties): $2.98

**Spicy Paprika Tahini Sauce**

* 3 tablespoons tahini
* 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
* Dash of hot sauce
* Squeeze of lemon juice
* Salt to taste

###Directions

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F.
2. Transfer the shredded beets to a large mixing bowl and set aside.
3. In a blender or food processor, pulse the cooked eggplant and chickpeas together until a thick, chunky paste is formed. Don’t get this puree completely smooth – you want to keep a fair amount of eggplant pieces and chickpeas intact.
4. Scrape out the eggplant and chickpea puree and add it to the mixing bowl with the beets. Add the cooked quinoa, flax egg, and paprika. Mix and adjust seasoning. Add a squeeze of lemon if you want or have it.
5. Using a half-cup measure to portion out the burger dough, make five patties. Definitely wear gloves for this part, unless you want hot pink hands!
6. Grease a baking sheet with olive oil and place the patties. Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the patties are crisp-looking on the outside and cooked through on the inside. You may need to flip them over once or twice during baking to ensure they are evenly browned.
7. Once the burgers are cooked, pile them on buns with your favorite burger fixings and an extra drizzle of tahini sauce!

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

&gt; It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

&gt; Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

&gt; Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

&gt; Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

* 1 LARGE eggplant
* 1 cup prepared marinara sauce (or more, to taste)

**For Stuffing**

* 2-3 medium potatoes, cut into 1-inch dice (about 1 1/2 cups cubed)
* 1 medium onion, sliced
* 3 garlic cloves
* 1/2 yellow or orange bell pepper, sliced into 1-inch-long strips
* 1 can black beans, drained and rinsed

**Seasonings**

* 1 Tbsp oregano
* 1/2 Tbsp thyme
* 1/4 Tbsp sage
* 1/2 Tbsp paprika
* 2 Tbsp nutritional yeast
* salt, pepper to taste

###Instructions

**To Prepare the Eggplant**

1. Slice eggplant lengthwise into 1/4 inch-thick slices. Sprinkle salt on both sides of each slice, put all slices in a bowl, and let sit for 15-20 min, until eggplant slices release their bitter juices.

2. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Pat each eggplant slice dry with paper towels to absorb the bitter juices. Lightly spray both sides of each slice with cooking spray. Arrange slices on a cookie sheet.

3. Bake in the oven for 15 min, then flip each slice and bake for another 5 min, until eggplant is soft. It doesn’t need to be completely done at this point, just soft enough to roll up. Remove eggplant from the stove and set aside to cool. Reduce the heat of the oven to 375°F.

Alternatively, you can grill eggplant for about 5 min per side.

**To Prepare the Stuffing**

1.  Steam cubed potatoes in a steamer until they are soft, about 10-15 min. If you don’t have a steamer, boil potatoes until done, drain and set aside.

2. Meanwhile, heat 1-2 Tbsp of water or vegetable broth in a nonstick pan on medium heat. When the liquid is bubbling, add chopped onions and garlic, saute them for 5 min until soft, stirring occasionally. Add sliced bell pepper, saute for 3 min. Add drained and rinsed black beans along with oregano, thyme, sage, and paprika. Stir well and let the beans heat through, about 3 min. Add steamed or boiled potatoes, stir the mixture breaking up potatoes slightly.

3. Put the potato-bean mixture into a large bowl, add nutritional yeast, mix well and taste. If you prefer a saltier taste, add salt.

**To Assemble the Rollups**

1. Add 1-2 Tbsp of marinara sauce to the bottom of an ovenproof baking dish (I used an 8 by 8-inch Pyrex glass pan).

2. Take a slice of baked eggplant, put a large spoonful (about 1/3 cup or more) of potato-bean stuffing on one end of the slice, and cover it with the remaining part of the slice. Ideally, the ends just need to touch. If they overlap, you may add more stuffing; if they don’t touch, remove some. Put your rollup into the baking dish with the seam facing down.

3. Proceed with the rest of the eggplant pieces. You may have some extra stuffing left if your eggplant wasn’t very big.

4. Once all of the rollups are in the baking dish, pour the rest of marinara sauce over them, spreading to cover all rollups evenly. Bake uncovered for 20 min at 375°F. Once done, let cool for 5-10 min before serving.",2015-12-05 18:44:29+00:00,cxo946a,1.0,t3_3vkfot,26.0,veganrecipes

3910,"This article is well written, but as far as content goes it gets a lot wrong. I think the only valid criticism it makes is that some vegans might exaggerate the global warming impact of cutting back on animal products in their Facebook comments (but that is just one aspect of the environmental impact of animal agriculture). 

&gt; The biggest cause of climate change isn’t any single point source of emissions. The biggest cause of climate change is the continuation of a dig, burn and dump economy that treats our planet like an open sewer and puts the interest of big polluters, including agribusiness, ahead of people.

Nobody is claiming that any single point source is the biggest cause of climate change. This is simply a straw man.

&gt; If the goal is really to deal with the emissions from agriculture, and these emissions are a big problem, it’s time to stop telling people not to eat meat and start figuring out how you’re going to stand with peasant farmers who are being forced by the Monsantos of the world to abandon their traditional methods of agriculture for massive mono-crop operations. It’s time to support communities that are standing up to stop cattle barons who want to clear massive tracts of land — like the rainforest in South America– to expand their operations. These things, might help to tip the scales and bring down emissions from agriculture in a way that more vegans just wont, and they might win you some allies along the way.

The reason we are moving from outdated forms of agriculture to modern ones is because modern ones are more efficient. They have greater yield using less land, and often less of many other harmful inputs. The author is seriously misguided if they think we can feed a modern world with agricultural techniques that were developed when the world had a population of a few hundred million.

&gt; One more thing, and I’m sorry but I can really only say it one way — the “go vegan to save the planet” mantra is kinda racist. It ignores that for a lot of the world – especially in the poorest regions and those most impacted by climate change – diet isn’t a choice.

What was arguably racist was the author’s insinuation that other cultures should be stuck with ancient traditions and unable to embrace technological advancement. The people in the poorest regions of the world are also the ones who are already eating the least meat. The individuals who need to cut back are the ones who have the luxury of being able to consume a diet that is high in animal products. ",2015-12-02 18:08:08+00:00,cxkm7sy,1.0,t3_3v5x8u,3390.0,vegan

* 1 tablespoon grapeseed or safflower oil
* Coarse or kosher salt and black pepper
* 6 large, unpeeled garlic cloves
* 1½ cups cooked cannellini or great northern beans (or 1 can cannellini or great northern beans, drained and rinsed)
* ½ teaspoon sea salt
* ¼ teaspoon smoked paprika
* 2 tablespoons lemon juice
* 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
* 6 slices of toasted, crusty whole grain bread, cut into halves
* ½ cup finely chopped parsley leaves (optional, for garnish)

**Instructions**

1. Preheat oven to 400F. Toss the cauliflower florets in the grapeseed or safflower oil and spread onto two parchment or foil-lined baking sheets. Nestle the garlic cloves in between the cauliflower and sprinkle it all with coarse/kosher salt and black pepper. Roast for 25-30 minutes, or until the cauliflower is gently browning, stirring once halfway through. Allow the cauliflower to cool for 10 minutes.

Add 1 heaping cup of the roasted cauliflower (you should have another heaping cup left--that's for garnishing the toasts!). Take the garlic cloves, which should be soft now, and squeeze in the roasted garlic, discarding the peels.
3. Pulse everything a few times to break it down, and then process it until relatively smooth, stopping once or twice to scrape the bowl down. With the motor running, drizzle in the olive oil. Continue processing the mixture until it's smooth and even (though you'll retain some texture no matter what -- it won't look like super smooth hummus!).

* Salt and pepper
* 2 tsp. garlic powder
* 1 Tbs. onion powder
* 2 tsp. dried parsley
* 2 Tbs. safflower oil

1. Cut the tofu into shapes that resemble French fries. In a large resealable storage bag or in a shallow bowl, add the flour and the spices. Add the tofu fries to the bag or bowl and toss them around gently until the tofu is covered in the seasoned flour.
2. Heat the oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Shake off the excess flour from the tofu fries and cook them in batches in the pan until they are browned and crispy. This might take about 4-5 minutes per side. The 2nd batch will cook faster since the pan and the oil will be hotter.
3. While the tofu fries are cooking, combine the hot sauce, Vegan butter and agave in a large bowl and whisk.
4. When the tofu fries are cooked, transfer them to the hot sauce mixture and toss to coat.
5. Serve with celery and carrot sticks and the dipping sauce of your choice. We made a Vegan “ranch” dressing by combining mayo, sour cream, dill, and pickle relish.",2015-12-02 16:12:05+00:00,cxkhbxz,1.0,t3_3v5ngz,11.0,veganrecipes

Roast for 25-30 minutes, or until the cauliflower is gently browning, stirring once halfway through. Allow the cauliflower to cool for 10 minutes.
2. Place the beans, sea salt, paprika, and lemon juice in a food processor fitted with the S blade. Add 1 heaping cup of the roasted cauliflower (you should have another heaping cup left--that's for garnishing the toasts!). Take the garlic cloves, which should be soft now, and squeeze in the roasted garlic, discarding the peels.
3. Pulse everything a few times to break it down, and then process it until relatively smooth, stopping once or twice to scrape the bowl down. With the motor running, drizzle in the olive oil. Continue processing the mixture until it's smooth and even (though you'll retain some texture no matter what -- it won't look like super smooth hummus!).
4. Spread two tablespoons of the spread onto each toast half. Top them with the remaining roasted cauliflower florets and a sprinkle of parsley leaves, if desired. Serve.",2015-12-02 16:07:53+00:00,cxkh5up,1.0,t3_3v5mrf,17.0,food

**Ingredients**

* 1 block extra-firm tofu, pressed and drained (choose organic/non-GMO)
* 2 Tbs. gluten-free tamari
* 2 Tbs. vegetable broth
* Kosher salt
* Kelp flakes
* Old Bay Seasoning
* 2 Tbs. vegetable oil
* 2 Tbs. vegan butter
* Lemon slices

**Directions**

1. Cut the block of tofu in half and then cut each half in two width-wise. You should have 4 thin rectangles. I used a 1.75 inch-biscuit cutter to press 2 circles out of each rectangle of tofu. If you don’t have a biscuit cutter, you can use a cookie cutter or even the top of a can of cooking spray. Save the leftover tofu pieces for a stir-fry. Using a paring knife, cut a shallow X in the top and bottom of each scallop.
2. Combine the tamari and the broth in a shallow bowl. Marinate the scallops for at least 30 minutes. Remove them from the marinade and pat the scallops dry with a paper towel. If they are wet, they will not sear in the pan. Sprinkle the scallops with a bit of salt, kelp flakes and Old Bay Seasoning on both sides.
3. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the vegetable oil and the butter to the pan. When the butter melts, carefully place each scallop in the pan. Don’t overcrowd the pan; if your pan can’t hold all 8 scallops comfortably, cook them in 2 batches. Once you put the scallop down, don’t move it. Don’t touch it. Let it form a sear. You should be able to see the bottom of the scallop browning.
4. After about 2 minutes, carefully flip the scallops over and cook on the other side. While the 2nd side is cooking, tilt the pan and use a large spoon to baste the tops of the scallops with the butter and oil. This will keep them from drying out. You should see the sides of the scallops turning brown like pretty rings. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel to drain before serving. Serve with lemon slices.",2015-12-02 16:03:48+00:00,cxkh04w,1.0,t3_3v5m5o,14.0,veganrecipes
3916,"&gt;The French have already discovered that the blackness of the skin is no reason why a human being should be abandoned without redress to the caprice of a tormentor. It may come one day to be recognized, that the number of the legs, the villosity of the skin, or the termination of the os sacrum, are reasons equally insufficient for abandoning a sensitive being to the same fate. What else is it that should trace the insuperable line? Is it the faculty of reason, or, perhaps, the faculty of discourse? But a full-grown horse or dog is beyond comparison a more rational, as well as a more conversable animal, than an infant of a day, or a week, or even a month, old. But suppose the case were otherwise, what would it avail? the question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?

**For the spice rub**

* 1/4 cup raw turbinado sugar
* 2 Tbs. smoked paprika
* 1 tsp. cayenne pepper
* 3 garlic cloves, minced
* 2 tsp. dried oregano
* 1 Tbs. Kosher salt
* 1 ½ tsp. ground black pepper
* ¼ cup fresh parsley, minced

**For the Balsamic BBQ Sauce**

* ½ cup apple cider vinegar
* ¾ cup balsamic vinegar
* ¾ cup maple syrup
* 1 1/2 cups ketchup
* 1 red onion, minced
* 1 garlic clove, minced
* 1 serrano chile, seeded and minced

**For the Seitan Ribs**

* 2 cups vital wheat gluten
* 3 Tbs. Mexican chile powder
* 3 Tbs. dried onion powder
* 3 Tbs. dried garlic powder
* ¼ cup nutritional yeast
* ½ tsp. ground black pepper
* 2 cups water
* ¼ cup tahini
* ¼ cup low-sodium soy sauce
* 2 tsp. liquid smoke

###Directions

1. In a small bowl, combine the ingredients for the spice rub. Mix well and set aside.
2. In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the apple cider vinegar, balsamic vinegar, maple syrup, ketchup, red onion, garlic and chile. Stir and let simmer, uncovered, for about an hour. Increase the heat to medium-high and cook for 15 more minutes until the sauce thickens. Stir it often. If it seems too thick, add some water.
3. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, combine the dry ingredients for the seitan and mix well. In a smaller bowl, combine the wet ingredients. Add the wet ingredients to the dry and mix until just combined. Knead the dough lightly until everything is combined and the dough feels elastic.
4. Grease or spray a baking dish. Add the dough to the baking dish, flattening it and stretching it out to fit the dish. Cut the dough into 8 strips and then in half to make 16 thick ribs. (Note: if you want the ribs thin, this is enough dough to fill 2 baking sheets. If you want them thick, it is enough for one).
5. Top the dough with the spice rub and massage it in a bit. Bake the seitan for 40 to 60 minutes or until the seitan has a sturdy texture to it (thinner ribs will cook faster). Remove the dish from the oven. Recut the strips and carefully remove them from the baking dish.
6. Increase the oven temperature to 400 degrees. Slather the ribs with BBQ sauce and lay them on a baking sheet. Put the ribs back in the oven for just about 10 minutes so the sauce can get a bit charred. Alternatively, you can cook the sauce-covered ribs on a grill or in a grill pan.

**For the Tempeh Ribs**

1. Slice a package of tempeh into 6 or 8 rectangles, depending how wide you want the “ribs” to be. If you want them to be thinner, slice the tempeh in half like a bagel first. I like my tempeh thin so I do this extra cut all the time. Steam the tempeh for 15 minutes until it softens a bit.
2. Coat the tempeh with the spice rub. Cook the tempeh ribs in the oven or in a skillet until browned on both sides. This should take about 8 minutes per side.

Like all other mammals cows only produce significant amounts of milk for a period of time after they have had a calf. In commercial dairy production cows are impregnated about once a year. When their calves are born the calves are taken away from their mothers. The male calves are of no use to the dairy industry so they are slaughtered for veal. Females will become dairy cows like their mothers. Unfortunately, cows do not maintain a high level of dairy production for their entire lives. Generally they will be considered ""spent"" and sent to slaughter by the dairy industry around the age of 5 (a typical lifespan for cattle is around 15 years). 

Many similar problems exist in the egg industry. Only hens (females) produce eggs. The males of egg laying breeds do not grow fast enough to even be worth raising for meat, so they are generally slaughtered shortly after hatching. The hens will start producing far fewer eggs after they reach a couple years of age, and they will be sent to slaughter at that point when it is cheaper to replace them with new chicks.

Other animals do not possess all of the capacities that a typical human would have, but they show responses that appear quite similar to our own reactions to suffering when treated in many of the ways that would cause us to suffer.

[Utilitarianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) is a common school of ethical thought amongst vegans. Utilitarians view an action as good if it maximizes the amount of goodness (generally judged as increasing pleasure or happiness, and minimizing pain or suffering) that is expected to occur as a result. While many ethical vegans will openly admit that they enjoy the taste of meat (evidenced by the numerous meat alternatives available for vegans today), they recognize that the harm caused to other animals to produce these products almost certainly exceeds the pleasure they gain as a result. The boycott that is veganism lessens demand for these products, and correspondingly supply will decrease as a result.

Another way of expressing this is in the principle of [equal consideration of interests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_consideration_of_interests). That is to say that the interest of any individual should be given equal consideration where, and to the extent that the interest exists. This isn't to say that all interests are equal, experienced equally, or that all animals possess interests, but that where there are interests, we should weight that interest proportionally to the intensity of the interest and not discriminate on any other basis.",2015-11-28 05:28:47+00:00,cxfh726,1.0,t3_3uj04b,17747.0,vegan

People believe different things on whether the earth is round or whether humans and other animals share a common ancestor. That doesn't mean those things are in reality mere matters of opinion. The language of mathematics is a human creation that has also changed over time, but it has real meaning and importance. Ethics similarly has real meaning when discussing how our actions impact the well-being of others. 

&gt; I pretty much understand that all life is just made up of atoms. Animals and humans are higher in cognitive function than plants, which are also life. The meat industry creates huge amounts of animal life, yet unfortunately treats it poorly. Without it though many of the animals would never even have a chance of existence. Some consider just having the chance to exist winning the lottery.

If you actually thought that allowing an organism to exist was like winning the lottery then you would try to breed and populate the earth with as many organisms as possible, neglecting the impact this would have on the well-being of its inhabitants.

* (optional) 1/4 tsp asafetida or hing powder
* 1/2 tsp turmeric powder
* 1 1/2 tsp ground cumin powder
* 2 tsp fresh lemon juice
* 1 1/2 tbsp jaggery (or dark brown sugar or raw sugar)
* 1/2 tsp salt (to taste)
* 2 tbsp cooking oil (such as grapeseed oil )
* 1 cup water

**Directions**

1. In a large non-stick pot, heat the oil on medium heat.
2. Tear the curry leaves in half and add it to the pot, along with the black mustard seeds and asafetida. Fry for a few seconds until fragrant.
3. Immediately add the garlic and ginger. Fry for a few seconds. Add the onions and green jalapeno chili. Saute until fragrant and the onions start to become translucent. Be sure not to burn the mixture. If you find this happening, either add some more oil or turn down the heat.
4. Add the cooked black lentils, 1 cup water, turmeric powder, and salt. Combine and bring the soup to a gentle simmer. Turn down the heat to medium-low to maintain a gentle simmer.
5. Add the chopped tomato, ground cumin powder, lemon juice, and jaggery.
6. Continue to simmer on low heat. uncovered, until some of the water boils off and the soup becomes thick in consistency (about 10-20 min), mixing occasionally.  If you start to feel the soup becoming too thick, you can add a little more water.
7. Add the chopped cilantro. If needed, season once more with salt, lemon juice, and/or jaggery to taste. Simmer for additional 3-5 minutes.
8. Garnish with some fresh cilantro and serve warm with some fresh roti, naan, or toasted french bread.

**Note**

To Cook Black Lentils - Add the black lentils in a bowl. Wash and soak in water for about 20-30 minutes. Drain the water and cook using one of two methods: (1) Pressure Cooker , or (2) Pot of boiling water. Cook the Dal until soft, but not mushy. Drain the water after cooking the dal. I typically cook a bunch at once in my pressure cooker, cool, and freeze leftover plain cooked black lentils in a freezer bag.

**Ingredients**

* 1 block (14 Oz/400g)Extra firm Tofu
* 1/2 cup Rice flakes (poha)

5. It is important to season all three layers. That is tofu, corn starch batter and the rice flakes-bread crumbs mixture. Failing to do so could lead to bland tofu sticks but be careful and bear in mind that salt gets triple layered. Use your judgement to use the right amounts.
6. Heat the oil for frying.
7. Cut the tofu slices into finger sized sticks.
8. Check if the oil is hot by adding a pinch of bread crumb mixture into it. If it begins ti sizzle immediately, you are good to begin the frying.
9. Dip the tofu stick into the corn starch batter and the into the rice flake-bread crumb mixture. Ensure it is well coated.
10. Now lower it slowly into the hot oil. Repeat with a 2/3 more tofu sticks in one batch. Do not over crowd the pan.

I certainly anticipated that being vegan would be difficult, but I haven’t found that to be the case in reality. Most of the time I simply go to the supermarket and pick up the foods I enjoy or want to make, just like anyone else. 

For me being vegan wasn’t primarily motivated by a desire to stay healthy. I knew that the way farmed animals were treated was awful, and that animal agriculture was having a strong negative environmental impact as well. 

Everyone is against animal abuse and environmental destruction, and keeping these in mind as other reasons to stay vegan can be useful in helping you keep with your vegan lifestyle. 

One thing I encourage you to do is to make a small donation to a group that is doing work to alleviate these negative impacts of animal agriculture. The donation can be as little as $5 or $10, but it will be valuable to your success as a symbolic act showing that you care about the cause.

4163,"I chose to go vegan for animal rights reasons seven years ago. I admittedly enjoyed the taste of meat as much as anyone I know, and I grew up with this being a significant part of my diet. However, over time I began to question whether the convenience and enjoyment I was getting out of eating meat was sufficient to justify the things that necessarily had to occur to other animals in order for that meat to be produced.

Vegans are often portrayed as believing that other animals ought to be treated as being equal to people (an understandable belief given some frequently repeated quotes from Ingrid Newkirk of PETA). Other animals aren’t the same as you or I, and they do not require all of the same rights. Nonetheless, there is little doubt that there are many other animals who possess intelligence and other capacities beyond those of some humans who we would deem worthy of a higher level of consideration (for example young children, the severely mentally handicapped, or senile elderly individuals). While other animals do not possess interests to the same extent as the typical human, to the extent and degree that other animals do possess interests, I believe we ought to give [commensurate consideration to their interests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_consideration_of_interests) as we would to interests of a similar degree that are possessed by humans, and we should not discriminate on any other basis.

Many people point out that animals are still killed in the production of vegan foods as well as numerous other aspects of modern life. It is entirely true that adopting a vegan diet isn’t a solution to all of the world’s problems, or even all the ills that befall other animals as a result of our actions. Nonetheless, becoming vegan is an important way to significantly reduce the amount of harm that we cause to other animals.",2015-11-12 06:15:49+00:00,cwxfvqr,1.0,t3_3sgn6u,28284.0,AskReddit

4179,"&gt;The day may come, when the rest of the animal creation may acquire those rights which never could have been withholden from them but by the hand of tyranny. The French have already discovered that the blackness of the skin is no reason why a human being should be abandoned without redress to the caprice of a tormentor. It may come one day to be recognized, that the number of the legs, the villosity of the skin, or the termination of the os sacrum, are reasons equally insufficient for abandoning a sensitive being to the same fate. What else is it that should trace the insuperable line? Is it the faculty of reason, or, perhaps, the faculty of discourse? But a full-grown horse or dog is beyond comparison a more rational, as well as a more conversable animal, than an infant of a day, or a week, or even a month, old. But suppose the case were otherwise, what would it avail? the question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?

4190,"When I was considering the idea of veganism I went to some vegan forum similar to this one and I wrote about how I thought being vegan was a great idea, but it was just too hard for me. I told them that I was a college student with limited income and that I didn’t know what I would eat if I went vegan. The college did have a salad bar, but I couldn’t just eat salad all the time!

The responses from people on the forums weren’t as friendly as I’d hoped. They told me that my excuses were terrible. They said I could easily find other things beside salad at my college cafeteria, and that I could go off campus and buy cheap foods to eat if I really couldn’t find them on campus. 

I was upset that they said I wasn’t doing enough and that I needed to be doing more, but I also committed myself to making a genuine effort to eating as vegan as possible. 

I’m really glad now that the people on that forum said those things to me. I could go vegan, and after committing to making a genuine effort I quickly realized that I had successfully become vegan. I found tons more vegan options at the college cafeteria that I hadn’t realized were there before. I found that I enjoyed leaving campus on occasion to try out new options. Being vegan was not the sacrifice that I had made it out to be in my head. My only regret today, and the only regret of many other vegans, is that I didn’t go vegan sooner.

4242,"Humans are animals. Some humans have contemplated their place in the universe. Many others have not (likely a large proportion of humans prior to 10,000 years ago). I think we'd both acknowledge that whether or not someone contemplates their place in the universe should not determine whether or not it is okay to slaughter them. What do you think should draw the line?

A famous philosopher, Jeremy Bentham, attempted to answer this question. In 1789 he wrote:

&gt;The French have already discovered that the blackness of the skin is no reason why a human being should be abandoned without redress to the caprice of a tormentor. It may come one day to be recognized, that the number of the legs, the villosity of the skin, or the termination of the os sacrum, are reasons equally insufficient for abandoning a sensitive being to the same fate. What else is it that should trace the insuperable line? Is it the faculty of reason, or, perhaps, the faculty of discourse? But a full-grown horse or dog is beyond comparison a more rational, as well as a more conversable animal, than an infant of a day, or a week, or even a month, old. But suppose the case were otherwise, what would it avail? the question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?

In their ability to suffer, many other animals are very similar to us.

Manure being sprayed into the air is terrible for air quality in the rural communities where this is happening, and runoff from where manure is spread is creating dead zones in our waterways. 

Health-wise, nearly every major dietetic organization in the world recommends that diets in parts of the world where people can afford more than enough food should cut back on meat to improve health. 

There is also the benefit that we would be able to feed a much larger human population if we abandon animal agriculture. We are growing huge amounts of corn, soy, and wheat that is being fed to animals, and in return we only get a small fraction of the energy and nutritional value back that was fed to those animals. If this land that is already being used to grow crops for animals was used to grow crops that would be consumed by humans directly we could be feeding a far larger global population, or alternatively we could feed the same population while using much less land.

###Ingredients

**Tofu &amp; Marinade**

* 12 ounces extra firm tofu
* 2 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
* 1 tablespoon seasoned rice vinegar
* 1/2 teaspoon date sugar
* 1 1/2 teaspoons sriracha
* 1/4 teaspoon chili garlic sauce
* 1/4 teaspoon Chinese five spice powder (optional, removing makes it less smoky)
* 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated ginger
* 2 cloves of garlic, minced

**Pad Thai Sauce**

* 3 tablespoons seasoned rice vinegar
* 1 tablespoon lime juice
* 1 tablespoon reduced sodium soy sauce
* 3 teaspoons date sugar
* 1 teaspoon maple syrup
* 2 medjool dates, pitted
* dulse flakes to taste

**Pad Thai**

* 40g shallots, sliced thin
* 3 cloves of garlic, minced
* 1 teaspoon freshly ground ginger
* 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
* 1 teaspoon olive oil
* a bunch of broccolette or chinese broccoli
* 3 scallions, sliced, white and green parts separated
* one yellow squash, spiral cut to make fine noodles (about 220g worth)
* one zucchini, spiral cut to make fine noodles (about 140g worth)
* 2 cups bean sprouts
* peanuts, crushed

###Directions

**Prepare the marinade**

1. Dry your tofu as thoroughly as humanly possible. The drier you get it, the better it will bake. Combine your other ingredients in a bowl and whisk about. Feel free to adjust things here and there for your level of spiciness and enjoyment. Cut your tofu into 1″ cubes and toss with the marinade, fully coating it. Let your tofu sit in its marinade, in the fridge, overnight. You can also just do this for a few hours but you sound like some sort of commitment-phobe.

2. When you’re ready to bake your tofu, set your oven to 375. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Set your marinade tofu cubes on the sheet. Douse them with any remaining marinade. Bake for 30 minutes or until they’re golden brown.

**Prepare your sauce**

3. Microwave your dates in a bowl with a tablespoon or so of water for about 30 seconds. Add them, along with the rest of the ingredients, to a food processor and puree until it’s a smooth and delectable sauce. Dulse flake your little heart out.

**Make it work**

4. Spray a wok with some cooking spray. Over medium heat, cook the shallots for a few minutes. Keep them moving so they don’t burn. Add the garlic, ginger, and red pepper flakes and cook another 30 seconds or until the garlic is fragrant. Throw your meager teaspoon of olive oil in there along with your broccolette/chinese broccoli and the white slices of your scallions. Cook for 3-5 minutes or until the veggies are softened but still have a little crunch. Throw the “noodles” in the wok along with the pad thai sauce and cook until the sauce is throughly heated and everything’s all happy and hot. Add the bean sprouts and cook for another 30 seconds, keeping the bean sprouts crunchy. Remove from heat. Top with the green slices of scallions and peanuts. Eat.

* peanuts, crushed

###Directions

**Prepare the marinade**

1. Dry your tofu as thoroughly as humanly possible. The drier you get it, the better it will bake. Combine your other ingredients in a bowl and whisk about. Feel free to adjust things here and there for your level of spiciness and enjoyment. Cut your tofu into 1″ cubes and toss with the marinade, fully coating it. Let your tofu sit in its marinade, in the fridge, overnight. You can also just do this for a few hours but you sound like some sort of commitment-phobe.

2. When you’re ready to bake your tofu, set your oven to 375. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Set your marinade tofu cubes on the sheet. Douse them with any remaining marinade. Bake for 30 minutes or until they’re golden brown.

**Prepare your sauce**

3. Microwave your dates in a bowl with a tablespoon or so of water for about 30 seconds. Add them, along with the rest of the ingredients, to a food processor and puree until it’s a smooth and delectable sauce. Dulse flake your little heart out.

**Make it work**

4. Spray a wok with some cooking spray. Over medium heat, cook the shallots for a few minutes. Keep them moving so they don’t burn. Add the garlic, ginger, and red pepper flakes and cook another 30 seconds or until the garlic is fragrant. Throw your meager teaspoon of olive oil in there along with your broccolette/chinese broccoli and the white slices of your scallions. Cook for 3-5 minutes or until the veggies are softened but still have a little crunch. Throw the “noodles” in the wok along with the pad thai sauce and cook until the sauce is throughly heated and everything’s all happy and hot. Add the bean sprouts and cook for another 30 seconds, keeping the bean sprouts crunchy. Remove from heat. Top with the green slices of scallions and peanuts. Eat.

*Serves 4*

**Ingredients**

* 225g fusilli
* ¾ cup cashews, soaked for at least 2 hours
* 1½ cups vegetable or mushroom broth

**For the tofu**

* 396g extra–firm tofu, sliced into thin strips
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* Pinch of salt

**For the sauce**

* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 1 medium yellow onion, quartered and thinly sliced
* ½ tsp salt, plus a pinch
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 225g cremini mushrooms, thinly sliced
* 1 tsp dried thyme
* ½ cup dry white wine
* 2 tbsp tomato paste
* Chopped fresh flatleaf parsley, for garnish (optional)

**Directions**

1. To get the strips of tofu for this recipe, slice tofu in half through the equator, like a clam. Then slice each half into 0.5cm-thick strips. You should end up with slices that are about 8cm long by 2.5cm wide.

2. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for the pasta. When it's boiling, cook the pasta according to the package directions. Drain and set aside.

3. Drain the cashews and add them to a blender along with the vegetable broth. Blend until very smooth, with only a slight graininess. This could take anywhere from 1-5 minutes depending on the strength of your machine. Scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula now and again to make sure you get everything.

4. For the tofu, preheat a large, heavy-bottomed pan over medium heat and add the oil. Sauté the tofu along with the salt for 5 minutes or so, until it's just slightly browned. Set the tofu on a plate covered with aluminum foil as you prepare the sauce.

5. Now on to the sauce. In the same pan in which you cooked the tofu, still on a medium heat, add the oil and sauté the onion in the oil along with a pinch of salt for about 5 minutes, until translucent. Add the minced garlic and sauté for 30 seconds or so.

6. Now add the mushrooms and thyme and cook until the mushrooms are lightly browned, about 5 more minutes. Add the wine, tomato paste, remaining ½ tsp salt, and pepper, stir, and turn the heat up to high. Let the wine reduce by about half. This should take 5 minutes or so. Turn the heat back down to medium.

7. Pour in the cashew mixture. Stir until well combined and let it thicken for about 5 minutes. Taste for seasoning. Add the tofu and carefully toss to coat, so as not to break the tofu. Serve over the pasta, and garnish with fresh parsley, if you like.",2015-10-21 15:33:26+00:00,cw7or06,1.0,t3_3pn7vx,14.0,veganrecipes

4322,"&gt;They actually respond to pain and become distressed. 

Plants react to stimuli. That is also true of light bulbs that react to an electric current, rocks that react to being kicked, or my computer that reacts to my pressing on the keys or moving the mouse. Reacting to stimuli does not demonstrate that a being responds to pain or experiences fear. 

We know that in ourselves these experiences lie within our nervous system. Plants do not possess a nervous system. What kind of experiment could possibly show that plants are responding to pain or experiencing fear? We don't have sufficient understanding of the origins of sentience to possibly say with even slight confidence that experiences of pain and fear could arise in something so different from ourselves. 

That said, suppose for a moment that plants do possess these traits. That doesn't get you off the hook from considering the harm your actions have on others. It would make it all the more important to minimize the harm your actions are causing to others.

Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein

Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day.

**Ingredients**

* 1 1/4 cups canned black beans, drained, rinsed &amp; mashed
* 1 cup cooked black rice, (1/2 cup uncooked)
* 1/4 cup raw beets, grated on a microplane
* 1 1/4 cups fresh shiitake mushrooms. processed until crumbly, thick stems removed
* 1/2 - 3/4 cup walnuts, processed until fine and crumbly
* 1 tsp smoky spanish paprika
* 1 Tbsp spicy brown mustard
* 1/2 tsp apple cider vinegar
* 1/2 tsp salt
* a few pinches of pepper
* flax liquid: 1 1/2 Tbsp veggie broth + 1 1/2 tsp ground flax seeds

**Directions**

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or grease the pan. I use coconut oil.
2. You can do this step beforehand for easiest prep: cook black rice. I use about 1/2 cup of rice and 1 cup of water or veggie broth. Add a pinch of salt if using water. Cover with lid and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer for about 25-35 minutes or until rice is tender. Check on the rice about 20 minutes into cooking and add another splash of water if you the rice looks a bit too dry.
3. In a large mixing bowl, add the rinsed beans. Mash them well with a fork.
4. In a blender or food processor, process the walnuts until they are crumbly and powdery. Add them to the mixing bowl.
5. Process the shiitake mushrooms the same way you did the walnuts, only the mushrooms with just be very crumbly, not powdery. Add them to the mixing bowl.
6. Add the cooked rice, beets, spices and all other ingredients for the veggie burgers to the mixing bowl. Start mashing with a fork and fold for about 5 minutes. You really want a very mashed and thick consistency.
7. You should be able to directly handle the mixture and form into patties. If the mixture is too wet you can either fold in a bit more walnuts, a spoonful of oat flour or you can place the mixture in the fridge to chill up a bit. If the mixture is too thick for your tastes, you can add in a tiny splash of veggie broth, until it thins out a bit.
8. Form patties and place on the baking sheet.
9. Spray or brush the tops of the patties with coconut oil or EVOO. (optional - adds a nice crispness to the tops.)

4351,"There is no denying that animal products have negative environmental consequences, cause harm to animals (should be pretty obvious), and are terrible for the plight of underprivileged workers. 

The meat industry [has one of the highest rates of injury and death out of any industry](http://www.powered-by-produce.com/2009/07/28/the-most-dangerous-job-in-america/). Slaughterhouse workers are working with blades and heavy machinery, performing repetitive motions at very high rates for hours on end. It is a recipe for disaster. Given the violent nature of the work and the overall disregard for life, it is hardly a surprise that the meat industry has [increased rates of violent crime among their workers](http://www.news.com.au/national/slaughterhouse-workers-are-more-likely-to-be-violent-study-shows/story-fncynjr2-1226560029984).

Research has found that [vegan diets have smaller greenhouse gas footprints](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10584-014-1169-1). Animal farming also requires far greater land usage (you have to grow plants first to feed to the animals, and you will always get back fewer calories in meat than you grew in plants), and runoff from animal farms causes countless fish kills and grows the size of the now numerous dead zones in our bays and oceans. It is easy to understand why even the [UN has stated that a global shift to a vegan diet is vital](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jun/02/un-report-meat-free-diet). 

Everyone is aware that conditions for farmed animals are not good, but I encourage everyone to take a closer look at what happens inside the meat industry by watching the documentaries [Earthlings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrgJXcyYWQE) and [Lucent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArL5YjaL5U). 

Finally, the overuse of antibiotics in the meat industry poses a grave health threat to everyone. [Low doses of medically important antibiotics are commonly fed to livestock to promote growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_use_in_livestock). These are ideal conditions for bacteria to develop resistance to these drugs that are of vital importance for treating legitimate illnesses.

**Ingredients**

* 1 medium sweet potato
* 1 medium onion
* 2 ribs celery
* 1 medium carrot
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 15-ounce can cannellini beans (or other white beans), drained and rinsed
* 14 ounces extra-firm tofu (one 14 to 16-ounce package)
* 2 tablespoons gluten-free soy sauce
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* 1 tablespoon spicy brown or whole-grain prepared mustard
* 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
* 1/2 tablespoon rubbed sage
* 1 tablespoon thyme leaf
* 1/2 tablespoon dried rosemary, crushed
* 1 1/2 teaspoon salt (or to taste)
* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
* 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
* 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
* 1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)
* 3/4 cup quinoa flakes or quick oatmeal

**Instructions**

1. Wash a medium sweet potato (about 7 ounces), pierce it several times with a fork, wrap it in a paper towel, and microwave until done, 4-5 minutes. (Alternately, bake or steam the sweet potato.) Allow to cool enough to handle and then peel and set aside.

2. Mince the onion, celery, and carrot. You can do this quickly by cutting each vegetable in quarters and then pulsing in a food processor until finely chopped.

3. Heat a large, non-stick skillet. Add the minced vegetables, including garlic, and cook, stirring regularly, until they become tender, about 6-10 minutes. Add water by the teaspoon if necessary to keep the vegetables from sticking or becoming dry. Once they’re softened, add the drained beans and mash them lightly with a slotted spoon or spatula.

4. Place the peeled sweet potato into the food processor along with the tofu, soy sauce, and all seasonings, including nutritional yeast. Process until fairly smooth. Add the walnuts and pulse a few more times. Scrape the tofu mixture into a large mixing bowl and add the quinoa flakes and the cooked vegetables. Stir well.

5. Preheat oven to 375F. If you have a silicone baking mat (recommended) place it on a baking sheet. Otherwise line the baking sheet with parchment paper or spray with non-stick spray. Spoon the tofu mixture onto the prepared baking surface, using dampened hands to shape it into an oblong or oval loaf about 2 1/2 inches high. Bake for 25 minutes or until the top is evenly browned. Loosely cover with aluminum foil and cook for 20 more minutes. Check to make sure that the center is firm; if not, give it a little extra time. (You can also remove the foil and cook for 5 more minutes for a crunchier crust.)

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

&gt; Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

&gt; Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

&gt; Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

###Ingredients

**For the brown rice**

* 3/4 cup brown rice
* 3 to 4 cups water

**For the crispy baked tofu:**

* 1 block extra firm tofu
* 1/4 cup Bragg's liquid aminos or low-sodium soy sauce
* 1 Tbsp peanut oil or canola oil
* 1 Tbsp cornstarch

**For the bok choy:**

* 3 to 4 baby bok choy, rinsed
* 1 Tbsp peanut oil or canola oil
* sprinkle of pepper

**For the teriyaki sauce:**

* 1/4 cup Bragg's liquid aminos or low-sodium soy sauce
* 2 Tbsp mirin
* 2 Tbsp raw turbinado sugar (or brown sugar)
* 1/2 Tbsp sesame oil
* 1/2 Tbsp chopped fresh ginger
* 1 clove garlic, chopped
* 1/2 Tbsp cornstarch mixed with 2 Tbsp water

**To serve:**

* 2-3 green onions, sliced
* sesame seeds

**Instructions**

1. Make the rice. Rinse and drain rice. Add to a small pot, along with water, and bring to a boil. Simmer for 30 minutes. Drain, cover, and let sit for 20 more minutes. Fluff with a fork before serving.

2. Make the crispy baked tofu. Preheat oven to 425. Drain the water out of the package of tofu. Wrap the block of tofu in paper towels and squeeze out the excess moisture. Slice tofu into bite-sized triangles.

3. Place tofu in a bowl or large dish. Pour Bragg's and peanut oil over the tofu and sprinkle with cornstarch. Toss gently until tofu is coated with the mixture and no dry spots of cornstarch remain. Spread tofu on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake until deep brown and chewy, about 25-30 minutes, flipping halfway through.

4. Make the teriyaki sauce. While the tofu bakes, whisk or blend together the Bragg's, mirin, sugar, sesame oil, ginger, and garlic. Stir in the cornstarch/water mixture. Bring to a simmer in a small pan. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until mixture thickens, about 3-4 minutes. Remove from heat and pour into a small pitcher.

5. Make the bok choy. Slice the baby bok choy in half lengthwise. Spread halves on a baking sheet. Drizzle the leafy greens with peanut oil and toss them a bit to coat. Sprinkle with pepper. The bok choy will need to bake for just 6-8 minutes, so place them in the hot oven when the tofu has 6-8 minutes left to go.

6. To serve, scoop rice into bowls. (If you want to be really nice, you can chop up the roasted bok choy before serving.) Top rice with bok choy, tofu, teriyaki sauce, green onions, and sesame seeds. Enjoy!",2015-10-11 16:57:24+00:00,cvvxqma,1.0,t3_3ocj94,12.0,EatCheapAndHealthy

4432,"&gt;You're advocating forcing predatory animals into vegan diets. That's not how its supposed to work, you're asserting the philosophy that Man has reign over nature under the guise of ""protecting the animals"".

Why is it supposed to work your way? That is precisely what I'm asking. I understand that things have historically happened one way, and they happen that way in nature, but neither of those are good explanations for why we should allow them to happen that way.

&gt;How can you say you love animals and want to end cruelty &amp; their suffering when you want to force them into diets their bodies cannot handle? 

If I'm stuck in a situation where some animals are going to suffer then I choose the option that causes less suffering. How can you say you love animals if you ignore the suffering of some and choose an option that causes more suffering overall?

&gt;Vegan diets for cats simply don't work unless you have heavy vet supervision. I'll gladly feed my cat loads of fish if it means she won't die for my personal ideals.

Once again, this isn't for you! This is for the animals who are suffering. Why are you ignoring them? Can you acknowledge that animals are suffering when you feed your cat a non-vegan diet? Can you acknowledge that this suffering is greater than what your cat would experience if he/she was fed a vegan diet?",2015-10-10 21:22:42+00:00,cvv5at7,16.0,t1_cvv54qa,326.0,vegan
4433,"&gt;1.) My cat hunts for mice, birds, &amp; bugs to eat daily outside so a part of her diet is natural. I buy her normal cat food because it is a part of her diet and I will not force her body to undergo unnecessary diet for MY comfort.

This isn't for your comfort. It is about the animals who are dying to become cat food. If you can lessen the amount of suffering being caused then that is a good thing. If you lessen it as much as possible then that is the best choice you can make. You need to take into account both the impact on your cat and the impact on the animals being eaten when making this decision.

&gt;2.) I can greatly reduce the amount of animal suffering I used to contribute by being aware of any products I buy for my fridge and household. I check labels for animal testing, I read food cartons for things like gelatin. I also make sure my clothes are manmade or used with natural material like cotton instead of silk and I don't even buy products with honey anymore(bees are abused for human consumption). I'm already doing as much as I can to stop my personal contribution to animal suffering.

That's awesome that you're doing all these things.

&gt;3.) My cat is not a human toddler. She will not grow into a conscious adult with social awareness, she will stay the sane way she is, eating what her instincts tell her to eat. I won't interrupt her natural balance. And besides she doesn't even eat farm animals like cows or chicken, she eats canned fish. I weaned her off of those heavy foods because I didn't want her to become overweight.

Why would the fact that your cat doesn't later gain the ability to make fully informed choices make it wrong for you to help with those choices now? Human children with severe mental handicaps may never reach a point where they realize that eating candy all day is a bad choice, but I think you would still accept that it is appropriate for others to make sure they don't eat candy all day (at any point in their lives). 

Why is it so important to you that your cat does what is natural? It is pretty well accepted that [just because something is natural doesn't mean that it is good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_nature). ",2015-10-10 20:52:32+00:00,cvv4byj,14.0,t1_cvv41n1,526.0,vegan

**Meatballs**

* 1 tbs olive oil

* 1 small yellow onion, diced

* 2 cloves of garlic, diced

* 8 oz button mushrooms, cleaned with dry towel and chopped

* 1 tsp salt

* 1 tsp oregano

* 1/2 tsp black pepper

* 1/2 tsp chili flake

* 1 15 oz can of white beans, drained and rinsed

* juice of 1 lemon

* 2 tbs fresh parsley, chopped

* 1 1/4 cups bread crumbs, split into 1 cup and 1/4 cup

**Chard**

* 5 stalks chard, removed from ribs and chopped

* 1 clove garlic, diced

* 1/2 tsp salt

**Subs**

* 1 25 oz jar of your favorite marinara sauce

* sub rolls

* parsley and chili flake for sprinkling

###Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Heat a large skillet or cast iron pot oven medium heat. Once hot, add olive oil and onion and cook for five minutes. Next add garlic and mushrooms and cook for another two minutes. Stir in oregano, salt, pepper, and chili flake. Add white beans and lemon juice and stir, let the mixture cook for 1 more minute. 

2. Add the white bean mushroom mixture to the food processor and pulse a few times until the mixture comes together. Pour in the parsley and 1 cup of bread crumbs and pulse a few more times until the mixture is well combined. Let the mixture sit for five minutes so the bread crumbs absorb some of the white bean mushroom mixture. 

3. Meanwhile add remaining 1/4 cup bread crumbs, 1/2 tsp salt, and a pinch of pepper, chili flakes, and parsley to a bowl. Take a 1 tbs scoops of the 'meatball' mixture and roll it into a ball in your hands. Roll it around in the bowl of seasoned bread crumbs and place it on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat until there is no 'meatball' mixture remaining. 

4. Bake the 'meatballs' for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes flip them for even browning and continue to bake for another 20 minutes. 

5. While the 'meatballs' are baking, prepare the chard.  Heat a few tsp of olive oil over medium heat in the same pot or skillet you cooked the 'meatball' mixture. Add garlic and salt and cook for 1 minute. Pour the garlic oil over the chopped chard and massage. Set aside.

6. Add a jar of marinara sauce to the same pot you cooked the garlic in and heat over low heat. When the 'meatballs' are cooked, place them in the warm marinara sauce. 

7. Place chard in toasted buns and top with meatballs, parsley, and chili flake. Enjoy!",2015-10-10 20:38:01+00:00,cvv3ut3,1.0,t3_3o9a11,13.0,EatCheapAndHealthy

4436,"&gt; Its unethical to force an animal into a vegan diet as it does not have the same level of consciousness we do to make those choices.

If an individual is not capable of making an informed choice then why would we default to allowing it to make the worse choice? A young child does not possess the capacity to know that eating candy all day is bad for them, yet as a parent we make the decision for them to not allow them to eat too much candy.

&gt; Would you force wild animals into a vegan diet? Probably not. Humans have the luxury of omnivore diets &amp; conscious choice. I understand dogs can be easily switched to vegan diets but its rare because their stomach can process it. Cats however get most of their nutrients from meat. 

If the most effective thing I could be doing to reduce suffering was to force wild animals to eat a vegan diet then that is what I would do. I don't think that is the case. It has nothing to do with a principle of making sure certain animals always eat certain foods.

2. Add the white bean mushroom mixture to the food processor and pulse a few times until the mixture comes together. Pour in the parsley and 1 cup of bread crumbs and pulse a few more times until the mixture is well combined. Let the mixture sit for five minutes so the bread crumbs absorb some of the white bean mushroom mixture. 

3. Meanwhile add remaining 1/4 cup bread crumbs, 1/2 tsp salt, and a pinch of pepper, chili flakes, and parsley to a bowl. Take a 1 tbs scoops of the 'meatball' mixture and roll it into a ball in your hands. Roll it around in the bowl of seasoned bread crumbs and place it on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat until there is no 'meatball' mixture remaining. 

4. Bake the 'meatballs' for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes flip them for even browning and continue to bake for another 20 minutes. 

5. While the 'meatballs' are baking, prepare the chard.  Heat a few tsp of olive oil over medium heat in the same pot or skillet you cooked the 'meatball' mixture. Add garlic and salt and cook for 1 minute. Pour the garlic oil over the chopped chard and massage. Set aside.

6. Add a jar of marinara sauce to the same pot you cooked the garlic in and heat over low heat. When the 'meatballs' are cooked, place them in the warm marinara sauce. 

7. Place chard in toasted buns and top with meatballs, parsley, and chili flake. Enjoy!",2015-10-10 19:54:16+00:00,cvv2fd2,1.0,t3_3o9442,135.0,food

I give blood frequently, and I haven't heard of a vegetarian who manages to regulate a healthy iron level without popping pills. How natural is that?

Saying something happened historically, or saying something played a pivotal role in getting us to where we are today, or saying something is natural are all irrelevant to determining whether or not something is a good decision to be making today.

**Ingredients**

* 1 pound dried yellow-eye or navy beans, soaked overnight or quick soaked
* 1 large onion, chopped
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 5 cups water
* 4 teaspoons smoked paprika, divided
* 2 teaspoons dried oregano, divided
* 1 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin, divided
* 1 teaspoon dried basil
* 1 pound cubed winter squash or pumpkin (I used butternut), peeled and cut into 3/4-inch dice
* 1 large red bell pepper, chopped
* 1 jalapeño pepper, seeded and finely chopped (optional)
* 1 15-ounce can diced tomatoes (fire-roasted preferred)
* 1 teaspoon salt (or to taste)
* 1 bunch kale (about 12 ounces), removed from stems and sliced
* 1 cup fresh or frozen corn (optional)
* 1/2 cup chopped fresh basil

**Instructions**

1. Make sure to rinse your beans first and check for rocks and then soak overnight in cold water. Or do a quick soak by boiling the beans in enough water to cover by an inch for one minute, and then cover and allow to stand for at least an hour. Drain before proceeding with the recipe.

2. Heat a pressure cooker or large Dutch oven. Add the onions and a pinch of baking soda (optional but speeds up the browning). Cook until onion is soft and beginning to brown. Add the garlic and cook for another minute.

3. Add the beans, water, 2 teaspoons paprika, 1 teaspoon oregano, 1 teaspoon cumin, and dried basil to the pot. Bring to a boil. If pressure cooking, seal your cooker and bring to high pressure. Cook at high pressure for 8 minutes; then perform a quick release. If cooking in a regular pot, bring to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer, cover and cook until beans are just barely cooked all the way through, 30 minutes to 1 1/2 hours. Check pot occasionally and add more water to cover the beans if it seems low.

4. Add the squash along with the remaining seasonings, peppers, tomatoes, and salt, if using. Seal the cooker and cook at high pressure for 8 more minutes. Let pressure come down naturally; after 15 minutes, quick release pressure if necessary. For stovetop cooking, add more water if necessary to cover all ingredients. Cover and simmer until beans and squash are very tender.

5. Check the seasoning and add more cumin, oregano, or salt to taste. Add the kale and corn and simmer, covered, until the kale is tender. Stir in the basil and cook for another minute before serving.",2015-10-08 01:34:08+00:00,cvs0a0z,1.0,t3_3nx0ig,24.0,veganuary

###Ingredients

* 4 ripe avocados, halved, pits removed

**Chickpea Topping**

* 1 15-ounce (425 g) can chickpeas, rinsed, drained and patted dried
* 3 Tbsp (22 g) Tandoori Masala Spice Blend*
* 1/4 tsp sea salt
* 1 Tbsp (15 ml) grape seed or avocado oil
* 1 batch tahini sauce (or green chutney)
* Lemon juice
* Fresh parsley, chopped
* 6 baby tomatoes, diced
* 1/4 red onion, diced

**Black Bean Topping**

* 1 15-ounce (425 g) can black beans, slightly drained (if unsalted, add 1/4 tsp sea salt)
* 1/2 tsp each cumin, garlic powder and chili powder
* Lime juice
* Fresh cilantro, chopped
* 1/4 red onion (27 g), chopped
* 3-4 Tbsp salsa (or sub hot sauce)

###Instructions

1. **FOR CHICKPEAS:** Heat a large skillet over medium heat. While it heats, add drained/dried chickpeas to a mixing bowl and toss with sea salt and masala spice blend.

2. Once skillet is hot, add oil and chickpeas to pan and sauté, stirring frequently, until slightly crispy and browned - about 8-10 minutes. If browning too quickly, turn down heat.

3. Once the chickpeas are browned and fragrant, remove from heat and set aside to cool. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more salt or masala spice as desired.

4. Prepare desired sauce at this time (see recipes / instructions by following the links above).

5. To serve, halve avocados and remove pits. You can either scoop out the avocado or leave it in the skin (removing it from the skin is a little more messy, but it does make it easier to eat).

6. Top avocados with a generous squeeze of lemon juice, chickpeas, parsley, tomatoes, onion and desired sauce. Serve immediately - best when fresh.

7. **FOR BLACK BEANS:** Add slightly drained black beans to a small saucepan and season with cumin, garlic powder and chili powder. If unsalted, add 1/4 tsp sea salt. Stir to combine.

8. Cook over medium heat for 10 minutes, or until bubbly and warm.

9. While beans are cooking, prepare any desired toppings.

10. To serve, halve avocados and remove pits. You can either scoop out the avocado or leave it in the skin (removing it from the skin is a little more messy, but it does make it easier to eat).

11. Top avocados with a generous squeeze of lime juice, black beans, cilantro, onion and desired sauce (I went with salsa and hot sauce). Serve immediately as is or with tortilla chips - best when fresh.

Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

If you are trying to feed 7 billion people it doesn’t make sense to use 30% of the world’s arable land to only produce enough calories to feed 100 million people. 

In practice it also ends up requiring more of the inputs listed in the OP too. It takes longer to raise animals to market weight without using feedlots. If you are allowing animals to do things like walk around then they are burning calories, which means more feed that they will need to be fed. There are also few places in the world where animals can reasonably be outside grazing year round (and those places tend to be very good for growing crops). This means animals that are allowed to graze for parts of the year still need to have harvested crops grown, transported, stored and fed to them for a substantial portion of the year.

4544,"Thank you for taking the time to express your views respectfully and to ask well thought out questions. 

I agree that you cannot equate non-human and human animals. What we should do however is give similar consideration to similar interests. To the extent and degree that non-human animals can suffer we ought to give similar consideration to their suffering as we would to suffering experienced to a similar extent and degree by humans.

A chicken probably doesn’t experience everything that you do, but it is not unreasonable to think they can experience suffering to half or at least a tenth of the extent that we do when they are deprived of liberty and ultimately their lives. There are upwards of 50 billion chickens who are being deprived life and liberty every year. Even if we say their suffering is a mere 1/1000 of ours, this would still be an injustice on a scale that is unprecedented throughout all of history.

While you can probably imagine an extensive backyard where chickens are able to live out happy lives, in practice there are still many ethical concerns with keeping chickens for eggs. First off, only the females lay eggs. Just as many male birds hatch as female birds, and if people are only buying the females for eggs (as is the case for egg laying breeds) the males are being slaughtered at birth. Secondly, the females don’t lay a substantial number of eggs for their entire lives. Their egg production drops off after a couple years, and there is a significant issue with people who don’t want to slaughter or care for these unproductive birds who end up simply abandoning them. If you really want to you can rescue a spent laying hen, care for her for the remainder of her life, and she will lay some eggs, but the eggs would not be at any sort of competitive price (taking into account the cost of care) relative to the alternatives out there. It would only make sense to do this if you wanted to care for a hen in need, not to actually obtain the eggs as a food source. ",2015-10-05 23:46:29+00:00,cvpi9rq,1.0,t3_3nmw2m,2782.0,vegan

Other animals do not possess all of the capacities that a typical human would have, but they show responses that appear quite similar to our own reactions to suffering when treated in many of the ways that would cause us to suffer.

[Utilitarianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) is a common school of ethical thought amongst vegans. Utilitarians view an action as good if it maximizes the amount of goodness (generally judged as increasing pleasure or happiness, and minimizing pain or suffering) that is expected to occur as a result. While many ethical vegans will openly admit that they enjoy the taste of meat (evidenced by the numerous meat alternatives available for vegans today), they recognize that the harm caused to other animals to produce these products almost certainly exceeds the pleasure they gain as a result. The boycott that is veganism lessens demand for these products, and correspondingly supply will decrease as a result.

Another way of expressing this is in the principle of [equal consideration of interests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_consideration_of_interests). That is to say that the interest of any individual should be given equal consideration where, and to the extent that the interest exists.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

&gt; Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

&gt;  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

###Ingredients

* 4 ripe avocados, halved, pits removed

**Chickpea Topping**

* 1 15-ounce (425 g) can chickpeas, rinsed, drained and patted dried
* 3 Tbsp (22 g) Tandoori Masala Spice Blend*
* 1/4 tsp sea salt
* 1 Tbsp (15 ml) grape seed or avocado oil
* 1 batch tahini sauce (or green chutney)
* Lemon juice
* Fresh parsley, chopped
* 6 baby tomatoes, diced
* 1/4 red onion, diced

**Black Bean Topping**

* 1 15-ounce (425 g) can black beans, slightly drained (if unsalted, add 1/4 tsp sea salt)
* 1/2 tsp each cumin, garlic powder and chili powder
* Lime juice
* Fresh cilantro, chopped
* 1/4 red onion (27 g), chopped
* 3-4 Tbsp salsa (or sub hot sauce)

###Instructions

1. **FOR CHICKPEAS:** Heat a large skillet over medium heat. While it heats, add drained/dried chickpeas to a mixing bowl and toss with sea salt and masala spice blend.

2. Once skillet is hot, add oil and chickpeas to pan and sauté, stirring frequently, until slightly crispy and browned - about 8-10 minutes. If browning too quickly, turn down heat.

3. Once the chickpeas are browned and fragrant, remove from heat and set aside to cool. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more salt or masala spice as desired.

4. Prepare desired sauce at this time (see recipes / instructions by following the links above).

5. To serve, halve avocados and remove pits. You can either scoop out the avocado or leave it in the skin (removing it from the skin is a little more messy, but it does make it easier to eat).

6. Top avocados with a generous squeeze of lemon juice, chickpeas, parsley, tomatoes, onion and desired sauce. Serve immediately - best when fresh.

7. **FOR BLACK BEANS:** Add slightly drained black beans to a small saucepan and season with cumin, garlic powder and chili powder. If unsalted, add 1/4 tsp sea salt. Stir to combine.

8. Cook over medium heat for 10 minutes, or until bubbly and warm.

9. While beans are cooking, prepare any desired toppings.

10. To serve, halve avocados and remove pits. You can either scoop out the avocado or leave it in the skin (removing it from the skin is a little more messy, but it does make it easier to eat).

11. Top avocados with a generous squeeze of lime juice, black beans, cilantro, onion and desired sauce (I went with salsa and hot sauce). Serve immediately as is or with tortilla chips - best when fresh.

4660,"I'm going to read your comment charitably and assume that by ""animals"" you mean to say ""non-human animals"" as humans are animals who clearly possess the same social bonds and experiences as themselves.

With that said, not all humans possess these things more powerfully than all other animals. There are young children, the severely mentally handicapped, or senile elderly individuals who do not understand the concepts of freedom, value of life, or self-determination better than an adult chimpanzee, pig or cow. While it may make sense to treat these groups of humans differently from a fully able-bodied adult, we still recognize and respect their right to life or to not be kept in captivity against their will beyond what is necessary.

Philosopher Jeremy Bentham wrote in 1789:

&gt;A full-grown horse or dog is beyond comparison a more rational, as well as a more conversable animal, than an infant of a day, or a week, or even a month, old. But suppose the case were otherwise, what would it avail? the question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?

It doesn't matter who is the smartest or who understands life, freedom, or self-determination the best. What matters are the interests and experiences of all individuals who can possess such things.

4662,"I chose to go vegetarian for animal rights reasons about eight years ago. I admittedly enjoyed the taste of meat as much as anyone I know, and I grew up with this being a significant part of my diet. However, over time I began to question whether the convenience and enjoyment I was getting out of eating meat was sufficient to justify the things that necessarily had to occur to other animals in order for that meat to be produced.

Vegetarians are often portrayed as believing that other animals ought to be treated as being equal to people (an understandable belief given some frequently repeated quotes from Ingrid Newkirk of PETA). Other animals aren’t the same as you or I, and they do not require all of the same rights. Nonetheless, there is little doubt that there are many other animals who possess intelligence and other capacities beyond those of some humans who we would deem worthy of a higher level of consideration (for example young children, the severely mentally handicapped, or senile elderly individuals). While other animals do not possess interests to the same extent as the typical human, to the extent and degree that other animals do possess interests, I believe we ought to give [commensurate consideration to their interests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_consideration_of_interests) as we would to interests of a similar degree that are possessed by humans, and we should not discriminate on any other basis.

Many people point out that animals are still killed in the production of vegetarian and vegan foods as well as numerous other aspects of modern life. It is entirely true that adopting a vegetarian diet isn’t a solution to all of the world’s problems, or even all the ills that befall other animals as a result of our actions. Nonetheless, becoming vegetarian is an important way to significantly reduce the amount of harm that we cause to other animals.",2015-09-26 17:12:10+00:00,cvexv7q,1.0,t3_3mh65n,4115.0,AskReddit

* Freshly ground black pepper
* 1 cup chopped fresh collard greens or kale, tough ribs removed
* Juice of ½ to 1 medium lemon, to taste

**Instructions**

1. Warm the olive oil in a large Dutch oven or pot over medium heat. One-fourth cup olive oil may seem like a lot, but it adds a lovely richness and heartiness to this nutritious soup.

2. Once the oil is shimmering, add the chopped onion and carrot and cook, stirring often, until the onion has softened and is turning translucent, about 5 minutes.

**Ingredients**

* ¼ cup extra virgin olive oil
* 1 medium yellow or white onion, chopped
* 2 carrots, peeled and chopped
* 4 garlic cloves, pressed or minced
* 2 teaspoons ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon curry powder
* ½ teaspoon dried thyme
* 1 28-ounce can of diced tomatoes, drained
* 1 cup brown or green lentils, picked over and rinsed
* 4 cups vegetable broth
* 2 cups water
* 1 teaspoon salt, more to taste
* Pinch red pepper flakes
* Freshly ground black pepper
* 1 cup chopped fresh collard greens or kale, tough ribs removed
* Juice of ½ to 1 medium lemon, to taste

**Instructions**

1. Warm the olive oil in a large Dutch oven or pot over medium heat. One-fourth cup olive oil may seem like a lot, but it adds a lovely richness and heartiness to this nutritious soup.

2. Once the oil is shimmering, add the chopped onion and carrot and cook, stirring often, until the onion has softened and is turning translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, cumin, curry powder and thyme. Cook until fragrant while stirring constantly, about 30 seconds. Pour in the drained diced tomatoes and cook for a few more minutes, stirring often, in order to enhance their flavor.

3. Pour in the lentils, broth and the water. Add 1 teaspoon salt and a pinch of red pepper flakes. Season generously with freshly ground black pepper. Raise heat and bring the mixture to a boil, then partially cover the pot and reduce heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook for 30 minutes, or until the lentils are tender but still hold their shape.

4. Transfer 2 cups of the soup to a blender. Protect your hand from steam with a tea towel placed over the lid and purée the soup until smooth. Pour the puréed soup back into the pot and add the chopped greens. Cook for 5 more minutes, or until the greens have softened to your liking.

5. Remove the pot from heat and stir in the juice of half of a lemon. Taste and season with more salt, pepper and/or lemon juice until the flavors really sing. Serve immediately.",2015-09-26 15:17:04+00:00,cveu8vl,1.0,t3_3mgzw5,15.0,food

Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

4736,"I linked you to the Wikipedia article on vitamin B12 in my prior comment and stated that supplements do not come from animals. 

&gt;Industrial production of B12 is achieved through fermentation of selected microorganisms. Streptomyces griseus, a bacterium once thought to be a yeast, was the commercial source of vitamin B12 for many years. The species Pseudomonas denitrificans and Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii are more commonly used today.

It is crazy that you think of bacteria as animals, as animals refers to members of kingdom animalia, which bacteria are not. Plants and bacteria do respond to stimuli, but so does a rock if I kick it, a light bulb if I apply a current to it, or my computer as I am stimulating it by typing on the keys. Reacting to stimuli is not a sign that an organism possesses interests or the ability to suffer. 

We know that in ourselves those capacities lie within our nervous systems, and we have no evidence of other organisms evolving those capacities independently. Not all animals possess nervous systems. Sponges are members of kingdom animalia that do not possess a nervous system, but it seems pretty safe to conclude that they are not capable of suffering. I would say the line exists somewhere between sponges and fish.

However, if you still have doubts about plants or bacteria suffering, that isn't an excuse to contribute to their suffering and the suffering of animals. It would be reason for you to take into account their suffering and to try to do what is possible and practical to minimize it. You will use far fewer plants by eating exclusively plant-based foods, than you will by feeding plants to animals and then eating the flesh of those animals.

4760,"If you're interested in discussing the ethics of consuming animal products I would love to hear how you would respond to my comment in the thread I linked earlier. I have copied it here for your convenience:

Ultimately ethical veganism is a boycott intended to lessen the demand for animal products. Other animals do not possess all of the capacities that a typical human would have, but they show responses that appear quite similar to our own reactions to suffering when treated in many of the ways that would cause us to suffer.

[Utilitarianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) is a common school of ethical thought amongst vegans. Utilitarians view an action as good if it maximizes the amount of goodness (generally judged as increasing pleasure or happiness, and minimizing pain or suffering) that is expected to occur as a result. While many ethical vegans will openly admit that they enjoy the taste of meat (evidenced by the numerous meat alternatives available for vegans today), they recognize that the harm caused to other animals to produce these products almost certainly exceeds the pleasure they gain as a result. The boycott that is veganism lessens demand for these products, and correspondingly supply will decrease as a result.

Another way of expressing this is in the principle of [equal consideration of interests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_consideration_of_interests). That is to say that the interest of any individual should be given equal consideration where, and to the extent that the interest exists. This isn't to say that all interests are equal, experienced equally, or that all animals possess interests, but that where there are interests, we should weight that interest proportionally to the intensity of the interest and not discriminate on any other basis.",2015-09-17 02:14:09+00:00,cv494pc,12.0,t1_cv48yzm,277.0,gifs

As far as plants go, no, it hasn't been shown that they are conscious. It has been shown that they react to stimuli, but that can also be said of rocks, factories, or the computer you are on that reacts to you pressing the mouse or hitting the keys. However, if you are concerned about plants being harmed, then the best thing you can do is go vegan! Far fewer plants will be harmed if you eat them directly compared to having plants fed to animals and then having you eat the animals.

**Ingredients**

* 1 250g (8.8oz) bag of kale
* 4 garlic cloves
* 2 lemons, juiced
* 1 cup of walnuts
* 1-2 avocados
* About ½ cup of extra virgin olive oil
* Salt, to taste
* 1 500g (18oz) packet of pasta

**Instructions**

1. Start by lightly steaming the kale. I used a steaming basket which sat in a saucepan to do this in two batches. You want to get the kale a little softened, without properly cooking it. It will take just a couple of minutes and will turn bright green.

2. Now start cooking your pasta. Bring a large pan of water to the boil and add your spaghetti. While it's cooking, you will make the pesto.

3. If you have a large food processor, put the kale in with the walnuts, avocado, garlic and lemon juice in and whizz until it's blended but still chunky.

4. If you're using the hand blender method as I did, put the kale into a large bowl. Pour in the lemon juice. Place the walnuts and garlic on top of the kale and pour the olive oil over them. Press the hand blender down over all of the garlic cloves and blend until the garlic is completely pureed in that spot. Now move the blending stick around and blend all of the walnuts (these can be a little chunkier) and kale to achieve the desired texture. Some bits of kale could be left almost whole if you'd like it more textured.

5. When the pasta is ready, drain and return the pan.

6. Top with the pesto, add salt and pepper to taste, and then use tongs to distribute it. It can take a lot of work to get the pesto mixed in, because the kale sticks together a lot! You may need to add a little more oil.",2015-09-16 15:25:46+00:00,cv3k5fw,1.0,t3_3l6jpy,11.0,veganrecipes

4794,"Here is a quote from a book written in 1846 titled ""A Defense of Negro Slavery as it Exists in the United States""

&gt;I. The Slave -- Of all the parties concerned, the Slave probably received the most important benefits:
1st. He was benefited in a moral and religious point of view. As before shown, most of the perpetual bond men among the Jews were purchased of the Heathen nations round about; and of the moral and religious condition of these, we have a striking picture drawn in Leviticus, chapters xviii. and xx. These people were guilty of every species of wickedness which the mind can conceive. From idolatry to the lowest and most filthy crimes, they indulged without restraint. From this state of moral pollution, without a ray of light to guide their footsteps, they were transferred to the ownership of God's chosen people, under the immediate direction and control of Jehovah himself. From the ownership of Masters ignorant, degraded, and utterly blind in a moral sense, they were placed under the guidance of Masters whose minds and hearts were enlightened and mellowed by true religion, and who walked daily in accordance with the statutes of Heaven.

&gt;Slaves among the Jews were admitted to all the rights and privileges of the Jewish Church. Slaves were admitted to the right of circumcision when it was first instituted. See Gen xvii 13, which has already been quoted. In a word, they were admitted to all the privileges of the Church as any other individuals. Hence it is manifest, that the perpetual Slave among the Jews was greatly benefited, in a moral and religious point of view.

&gt;2d. He was benefited politically, as well as morally and religiously. Political and domestic Slavery, the most abject, existed among the Heathen tribes round about Canaan. Being uncontrolled by religious or moral principle, and being ignorant and degraded in intellect, the presumption is, that the Heathen Masters and Rulers governed with the most rigorous severity. Such is the case the world over, under similar circumstances. Placed under the authority and control of the Hebrew Master, the Heathen Slave was transferred from a state of political and domestic tyranny, to a state of comparative freedom. He was under the control of a moral, religious, and enlightened Master, instead of one ignorant and degraded, and utterly corrupt and debased in his moral and religious feelings. There were some laws likewise specially enacted for the benefit of the Slave. It was contrary to law, as laid down in the Ten Commandments, for a man to exact labor from his Slaves on the Sabbath day. Exod. Xx. 10. There are several enactments designed to protect the Slave from harsh and unnecessary cruelty on the part of the Master. In Exod. Xxi. 20, it is laid down that—“If a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod and he die under his hand, he shall be surely punished.” In the 26th and 27th verses of the same chapter it is laid down that—“If a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid that it perish, he shall let him go free for his eye sake. And if he smite out his man servant's tooth, or his maid servant's tooth, he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake.”

&gt;Here self-interest, one of the strongest principles of our nature, is brought in aid of moral and religious principle, to secure just and humane treatment to the Slave. The wisdom of the Divine legislation is, in no instance, more clearly manifest than in this particular instance, in reference to the treatment of Slaves. It would have been utterly impossible to have adopted any other measure which would have so completely secured the Slave from ill-treatment on the part of the Master.

&gt;3d. The Slave was further benefited, in being trained to habits of industry, and being made familiar with the arts of civilization. It is a remarkable fact, that a savage man never voluntarily betakes himself to regular habits of industry. Hence, all nations which have passed from savage to civilized life, have been compelled to pass through the crucible of Slavery. To educate and train a wild animal, you must first catch him and reduce him to a state of strict subjection: so likewise with a savage -- he must be reduced to subjection, and then by authority forced to regular habits of industry.

&gt;When we come to speak of the advantages of Southern Slavery this subject will be treated in extenso.

4803,"I think you're trying to derive an ought from an is. It is absolutely true that these things happen in nature, but that doesn't mean that we should emulate these behaviors ourselves or continue to act in the ways that our ancestors acted.

You already recognize that even though a lion might kill the young of other lions (and some humans even do the same and kill other humans) that doesn't actually make it okay for you to act that way. 

When it comes to how we ought to behave we should take into account the consequences of our actions. Will they cause harm to others? Will they make other individuals happier? We should try to act in ways that will maximize happiness and minimize suffering. 

Check out Wikipedia's article on [Equal Consideration of Interests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_consideration_of_interests) for a more thorough discussion of this idea.",2015-09-13 06:43:10+00:00,cuzt628,4.0,t1_cuzsziu,600.0,AskReddit

4805,"Ultimately ethical veganism is a boycott intended to lessen the demand for animal products. Other animals do not possess all of the capacities that a typical human would have, but they show responses that appear quite similar to our own reactions to suffering when treated in many of the ways that would cause us to suffer.

[Utilitarianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) is a common school of ethical thought amongst vegans. Utilitarians view an action as good if it maximizes the amount of goodness (generally judged as increasing pleasure or happiness, and minimizing pain or suffering) that is expected to occur as a result. While many ethical vegans will openly admit that they enjoy the taste of meat (evidenced by the numerous meat alternatives available for vegans today), they recognize that the harm caused to other animals to produce these products almost certainly exceeds the pleasure they gain as a result. The boycott that is veganism lessens demand for these products, and correspondingly supply will decrease as a result.

Another way of expressing this is in the principle of [equal consideration of interests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_consideration_of_interests). That is to say that the interest of any individual should be given equal consideration where, and to the extent that the interest exists. This isn't to say that all interests are equal, experienced equally, or that all animals possess interests, but that where there are interests, we should weight that interest proportionally to the intensity of the interest and not discriminate on any other basis.",2015-09-13 06:13:14+00:00,cuzslq5,1.0,t3_3kr6w6,256.0,AskReddit

these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein

&gt;Meat is great.

 

I’m interpreting this statement to mean that you enjoy eating meat. I do not doubt you. I grew up eating meat and I also found it convenient and enjoyable. I chose to stop eating meat because there is more to determining what is right and wrong than simply stating what I enjoy. Consuming meat was causing too much harm to others for me to continue consuming it.

 

&gt;We are supposed to eat meat.

 

I doubt you believe that there is some purpose to life that requires us to eat meat. I am going to interpret this statement to mean that you have doubts that it is possible to be happy and healthy without eating meat.

&gt; Why don't you stop wild animals from eating meat? Poor antelope, he's being eaten by a lion.

 

This is a good question that we often struggle with both with human conflicts as well as non-human ones. People in ISIS do not share our views of morality, but their actions are actively causing harm to other individuals. Should we intervene? You can find a great deal of philosophical debate on whether we should also intervene in areas where non-human animals are suffering.  I bet you already do agree with this more than you think. If you saw a deer whose leg had gotten trapped by a fallen tree branch you likely would intervene and help.

 

When it comes to intervening in other areas there may be other concerns that make it more difficult for us to confidently have a positive impact. Will more animals starve to death if we stop lions from eating antelopes? Will we only fuel extremism by bombing ISIS in Syria? Nonetheless, that shouldn’t stop us from doing what we can to lessen the suffering of individuals in the areas where we are able.",2015-09-10 22:27:38+00:00,cux9kwo,1.0,t3_3kgjhx,4140.0,vegan

There is a serious problem of backyard hen caretakers not wanting their hens when their production begins to drop off. They frequently aren’t willing to slaughter the animals they have cared for either, so all too often these hens just get abandoned.

&gt;No. Follow the biosecurity procedure when you are allowed to enter the farm. Being invited is vastly different to break and enter.

I gave an example of filming that would not involve breaking and entering. The vast majority of undercover investigations are done by individuals who have been hired at the farms and are simply filming the work they have been assigned being performed as they were asked to perform it.

&gt;Activists break into farms to stir up and record all the time. Clearly the law isn't working.

Is the law not working because they aren't being caught? (or it isn't actually happening anywhere near as often as you like to make up). How would this new law do anything about that?

I've been on animal farms. I've seen these farmed animals. However, the only farms I have been allowed to visit have been small farms that, interestingly, didn't seem to take any precautions about ""biosecurity"" risks from my presence there.

Most people involved view veganism/animal rights as [one of the most effective causes, if not the most effective cause that we can currently be donating to](http://reg-charity.org/effective-animal-charities/). A large part of this is due to the fact that reducing our consumption of animal products also helps reduce many human risks as well. Factory farms breed disease, so they raise the risk of human pandemics. They use disproportionate amounts of water and heavily pollute other water sources, making clean drinking water available to fewer people, and contributing to common third world killers like diarrhea and parasites.

4908,"Not the guy you asked, but here's a quick explanation of why many people go vegan:

Ultimately ethical veganism is a boycott intended to lessen the demand for animal products. Other animals do not possess all of the capacities that a typical human would have, but they show responses that appear quite similar to our own reactions to suffering when treated in many of the ways that would cause us to suffer.

[Utilitarianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) is a common school of ethical thought amongst vegans. Utilitarians view an action as good if it maximizes the amount of goodness (generally judged as increasing pleasure or happiness, and minimizing pain or suffering) that is expected to occur as a result. While many ethical vegans will openly admit that they enjoy the taste of meat (evidenced by the numerous meat alternatives available for vegans today), they recognize that the harm caused to other animals to produce these products almost certainly exceeds the pleasure they gain as a result. The boycott that is veganism lessens demand for these products, and correspondingly supply will decrease as a result.

Another way of expressing this is in the principle of [equal consideration of interests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_consideration_of_interests). That is to say that the interest of any individual should be given equal consideration where, and to the extent that the interest exists. This isn't to say that all interests are equal, experienced equally, or that all animals possess interests, but that where there are interests, we should weight that interest proportionally to the intensity of the interest and not discriminate on any other basis.",2015-09-06 09:57:37+00:00,cuscp47,6.0,t1_cuscii9,906.0,Fitness

**Ingredients**

* 1/2 head cauliflower, cut into bite-sized pieces
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 3/4 cup peeled and diced sweet onion
* 2 carrots, peeled and diced
* 1 red bell pepper, diced
* 2 garlic cloves, peeled and minced
* 2 teaspoons chili powder
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 4 cups vegetable broth
* 2 (29-ounce) cans black beans, drained and rinsed
* 2 cups baby spinach
* 3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
* 2 cups brown rice
* Bunch of fresh cilantro
* 1 lime, halved
* 1/2 ripe avocado, diced

**Directions**

1. In a large stockpot, steam or boil the cauliflower until very tender. Set aside.

2. In a large stockpot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, and red bell pepper and sauté for 3-4 minutes, or until the onions are translucent. Add the garlic, chili powder, cumin, and salt and stir for 1 minute. Add 3 cups of the vegetable broth.

3. In a blender or food processor, combine 3 cups of the black beans with the remaining 1 cup broth, the cauliflower, and spinach and blend until smooth. Add the puréed mixture and the remaining beans to the soup. Stir in the apple cider vinegar. Increase the heat to medium high and bring to a boil.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

&gt; Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

&gt; Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

&gt; Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

&gt; With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

&gt; A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

&gt; Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

&gt; Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

&gt; Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

&gt;  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

&gt; With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

&gt; A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

&gt; Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

&gt; Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

&gt; Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

5020,"I chose to go vegetarian for animal rights reasons about eight years ago. I admittedly enjoyed the taste of meat as much as anyone I know, and I grew up with this being a significant part of my diet. However, over time I began to question whether the convenience and enjoyment I was getting out of eating meat was sufficient to justify the things that necessarily had to occur to other animals in order for that meat to be produced.

Vegetarians are often portrayed as believing that other animals ought to be treated as being equal to people (an understandable belief given some frequently repeated quotes from Ingrid Newkirk of PETA). Other animals aren’t the same as you or I, and they do not require all of the same rights. Nonetheless, there is little doubt that there are many other animals who possess intelligence and other capacities beyond those of some humans who we would deem worthy of a higher level of consideration (for example young children, the severely mentally handicapped, or senile elderly individuals). While other animals do not possess interests to the same extent as the typical human, to the extent and degree that other animals do possess interests, I believe we ought to give [commensurate consideration to their interests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_consideration_of_interests) as we would to interests of a similar degree that are possessed by humans, and we should not discriminate on any other basis.

Many people point out that animals are still killed in the production of vegetarian foods as well as numerous other aspects of modern life. It is entirely true that adopting a vegetarian diet isn’t a solution to all of the world’s problems, or even all the ills that befall other animals as a result of our actions. Nonetheless, becoming vegetarian is an important way to significantly reduce the amount of harm that we cause to other animals.",2015-08-26 07:06:40+00:00,cug0zn6,1.0,t3_3if9n5,12038.0,infj

5148,"###Recipe

**Ingredients**

* 2 garlic heads/bulbs, top quarter cut off to expose cloves
* 6 tbsp + 1 tsp olive oil
* pinch of fresh thyme leaves (optional)
* 1 head cauliflower (2 pounds)
* salt + pepper
* 2 tbsp lemon juice, plus extra
* 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, or to taste
* 1 pound brown rice pasta, such as penne or fusilli 
* 2-3 handfuls baby arugula
* 1/4 cup walnut halves, toasted + chopped

**Directions** 

1. Adjust an oven rack to the middle position, place a naked baking sheet on the rack and preheat to 500 degrees F. Tear two squares of aluminum foil and place cut garlic heads in the centers. Drizzle exposed garlic tops with 1/2 tsp olive oil each. Season with salt, pepper, and thyme leaves (if using). Wrap garlic bulbs up securely and place in the oven. Roast until garlic is browned and mushy/tender, about 40 minutes.

2. While garlic is roasting, trim the cauliflower leaves and the extra bit of stalk at the bottom. Cut the head right down the middle, from top to bottom. From there, cut each half into 4 wedges. In a medium bowl, toss the cauliflower wedges with 2 tablespoons olive oil, salt, and pepper. Remove the pre-heated baking sheet from the oven and carefully lay the cauliflower wedges onto the surface, leaving some space around each piece. You should hear sizzling. Roast cauliflower until tender and well-browned, about 25 minutes (I flipped mine halfway).

3. Once slightly cooled, transfer cauliflower to a cutting board and cut into bite-size pieces. Unwrap roasted garlic and squeeze cloves out into a small bowl. Mash roasted garlic with a fork to make a smooth puree. Whisk in the lemon juice, pepper flakes, some salt + pepper, and 1/4 cup of olive oil. Set aside.

4. Cook brown rice pasta according to package directions with a fat pinch of salt in the water. Reserve 1 cup of pasta cooking water before draining. Once drained, return cooked pasta to the pot. Add chopped cauliflower, garlic sauce, arugula, extra lemon juice to taste, and 1/4 cup reserved cooking water. Add more cooking water as necessary to achieve desired consistency. Serve pasta with handfuls of chopped walnuts on top and extra chili flakes.",2015-08-08 17:31:13+00:00,ctw2b1i,1.0,t3_3g9fqp,101.0,food

5235,"Chickens are individuals with lives and desires of their own. They can be harmed and they can suffer, unlike the cake. 

To quote philosopher Jeremy Bentham famously:

&gt;The French have already discovered that the blackness of the skin is no reason why a human being should be abandoned without redress to the caprice of a tormentor. It may come one day to be recognized, that the number of the legs, the villosity of the skin, or the termination of the os sacrum, are reasons equally insufficient for abandoning a sensitive being to the same fate. What else is it that should trace the insuperable line? Is it the faculty of reason, or, perhaps, the faculty of discourse? But a full-grown horse or dog is beyond comparison a more rational, as well as a more conversable animal, than an infant of a day, or a week, or even a month, old. But suppose the case were otherwise, what would it avail? the question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?

Contemporary philosopher Peter Singer writes:

&gt;How far down the evolutionary scale shall we go? Shall we eat fish? What about shrimps? Oysters? To answer these questions we must bear in mind the central principle on which our concern for other beings is based...the only legitimate boundary to our concern for the interests of other beings is the point at which it is no longer accurate to say that the other being has interests. To have interests, in a strict, nonmetaphorical sense, a being must be capable of suffering or experiencing pleasure. If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for disregarding that suffering, or for refusing to count it equally with the like suffering of any other being. But the converse of this is also true. If a being is not capable of suffering, or of enjoyment, there is nothing to take into account.

These are the factors that we ought to be taking into account when deciding who matters ethically. They both show a clear distinction between chickens and cakes.",2015-07-31 01:34:38+00:00,ctma76p,14.0,t1_ctma0hk,306.0,WouldYouRather

5302,"We shouldn't use culture as an excuse for how animals ought to be treated. There are still things we should take into consideration when deciding how we ought to treat others. 

As philosopher Jeremy Bentham famously stated:

&gt;The French have already discovered that the blackness of the skin is no reason why a human being should be abandoned without redress to the caprice of a tormentor. It may come one day to be recognized, that the number of the legs, the villosity of the skin, or the termination of the os sacrum, are reasons equally insufficient for abandoning a sensitive being to the same fate. What else is it that should trace the insuperable line? Is it the faculty of reason, or, perhaps, the faculty of discourse? But a full-grown horse or dog is beyond comparison a more rational, as well as a more conversable animal, than an infant of a day, or a week, or even a month, old. But suppose the case were otherwise, what would it avail? the question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?

Contemporary philosopher Peter Singer writes:

&gt;How far down the evolutionary scale shall we go? Shall we eat fish? What about shrimps? Oysters? To answer these questions we must bear in mind the central principle on which our concern for other beings is based...the only legitimate boundary to our concern for the interests of other beings is the point at which it is no longer accurate to say that the other being has interests. To have interests, in a strict, nonmetaphorical sense, a being must be capable of suffering or experiencing pleasure. If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for disregarding that suffering, or for refusing to count it equally with the like suffering of any other being. But the converse of this is also true. If a being is not capable of suffering, or of enjoyment, there is nothing to take into account.

These are the factors that we should take into account when deciding what/who it is ethical to slaughter and eat.",2015-07-24 00:57:36+00:00,cte1swp,5.0,t1_cte0wq0,1638.0,aww

* 1 can chickpeas, reserving a small handful for the avocado cream (you can cook dried ones as well)
* 3 cloves garlic
* 1 small onion
* 2 teaspoons ground cumin
* A BIG bunch of both fresh parsley and coriander
* Salt and pepper
* 2 Tablespoons olive oil
* 3/4 cup chickpea flour (sometimes called gram flour)
* Burger buns and fresh tomato for serving

**For the avocado cream and tahini mayo**

* 1 avocado
* A small handful chickpeas left from can
* A bunch of fresh parsley
* 1 garlic clove
* 2 tablespoons tahini
* The juice of one lemon
* 2 tablespoons water

**Directions**

Throw your chickpeas, peeled garlic, onion, cumin and salt and pepper into a food processor and pulse until roughly blended. You’ll need to scrape down the sides. Now add in the fresh herbs, oil and flour and blend until you have a nice thick texture, but it will still be fairly moist. Place into a bowl and if you need, add a little more flour to help the mixture bind as you form them into the patties. Make them small or big as you prefer. In a flat frying pan, heat about half an inch of oil over medium to high and add in your burgers. Cook for about 4 -5 minutes on both sides and once they are on their second turn, press them gently to make them flatter if you need. They should turn a nice dark, golden brown and smell divine!

For the avocado cream, simply add to your processor the avocado (without skin of course!), the remaining chickpeas, parsley and 1 garlic clove and blend until smooth. For the tahini mayo, drop the two tablespoons of tahini into a small bowl with the lemon juice and water and whisk with folk until you have a creamy consistency.

Toast the bun, add the burger, then the avocado, then a slice of tomato and finish with the oozy, lovely tahini mayo!",2015-07-18 15:24:07+00:00,ct7q97d,1.0,t3_3dqque,32.0,food

According to the [American Dietetic Association](http://www.eatright.org/WorkArea//DownloadAsset.aspx?id=8417):

&gt;It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

Similarly, the [British Dietetic Association](https://www.bda.uk.com/foodfacts/vegetarianfoodfacts) describes veganism as a type of vegetarian diet and continues:

&gt;Well planned vegetarian diets can be both nutritious and healthy. They have been associated with lower risks of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, certain types of cancer and lower blood cholesterol levels.

&gt;Well planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for all stages of life.

The position of the Australian Government's [National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55_australian_dietary_guidelines_130530.pdf) is that:

&gt;Appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthy and nutritionally
adequate. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the lifecycle.

Finally the [Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx) state:

&gt;A vegan eating pattern has many potential health benefits. They include lower rates of obesity, heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer. Other benefits include lower blood cholesterol levels and a lower risk for gallstones and intestinal problems.

&gt;This eating pattern can take some extra planning. Vegans must make sure that enough nutrients like protein, iron, zinc, calcium, vitamins D and B12 and omega-3 fats are included.

5449,"**Ingredients**

* 1 15 oz can of black beans, rinsed and drained
* 1 cup cooked brown rice
* 3 cups roasted sweet potatoes, see recipe below
* 2 tablespoons chopped red onion
* 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro leaves
* ½ teaspoon salt
* ½ teaspoon cumin
* ½ teaspoon garlic powder
* ½ teaspoon smoked paprika
* ¼ teaspoon paprika
* Olive oil, for cooking
* 6 hamburger buns
* Burger toppings of your choice
* Jalapeno, to taste

**Roasted Sweet Potatoes:**

* 3 cups diced sweet potatoes
* 1 teaspoon olive oil
* ½ teaspoon cumin
* ½ teaspoon paprika
* ½ teaspoon garlic powder
* ½ teaspoon salt
* ¼ teaspoon pepper

**Curry Cilantro Mayo:**

* 1 cup Vegenaise or Just Mayo
* 1 and ¼ teaspoons curry powder
* 2 - 3 tablespoons finely chopped cilantro leaves
* 2 teaspoons lemon juice
* 1 pinch of salt

**Instructions**

1. Make the mayo: add all of the mayo ingredients to a medium sized bowl and stir until combined. Set aside.

2. Pre-heat the oven to 375 degrees F. On a large sheet pan, place the diced sweet potatoes, olive oil, and all the spices. Toss until sweet potatoes are coated and place into the pre-heated oven. Roast for about 25 minutes, flipping once, or until sweet potatoes are fork tender. Let cool for a few minutes.

3. Place all of the veggie burger ingredients into a food processor and process for about 3 - 5 seconds until everything is mixed together but still has some texture to it. Form patties (you should get about 6 of them depending on the size you make) and place them on a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Chill in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes.

4. Heat a large pan over medium heat and coat the bottom with a thin layer of olive oil. Place burgers in the hot pan and cook for about 10 minutes, flipping once, until burgers are heated through.

5. If grilling the burgers, grill over medium heat and rub a little bit of olive oil on the grill to ensure that the burgers don't stick.

6. Top veggie burgers with curry cilantro mayo and enjoy on a bun with toppings of your choice!",2015-07-04 17:02:15+00:00,css2r6b,1.0,t3_3c4911,26.0,food

The school also had a club day where students would go around to tables to find out about on campus clubs.

The core people involved in my club were interested in spreading animal rights, but many more people were only interested in tasty vegan food. I'm not a great cook, but I hosted a lot of vegan potlucks as club events. 

My club also did a lot of tabling on campus. I had inherited a lot of stickers that were printed by PETA from a previous animal rights group on campus that had died out a couple years before I started mine. I was also able to make pins/buttons for free using a button maker that the campus had, so we passed these things out for free.

One of our daily volunteers was terrified of leafleting at first. I asked her to at least come out with me to leaflet the line.

When we got people to approach the table I would generally start by asking them if they were vegan, vegetarian, or just interested (I phrased it this way because it seems like I am giving them a choice, but no matter what they answer it sounds like they are on the side of cutting back on animal products). If people said ""just interested"" I would encourage them to give up more animal products and consider going vegetarian. If they said they were vegetarian then I would push them toward veganism by saying something like.

&gt;Have you ever considered moving toward veganism? I'm sure you're aware that the conditions for egg laying hens and dairy cows are every bit as terrible as for animals raised for meat. I totally get that going vegan can seem daunting, I was very hesitant myself to make the switch at first. It means cutting out all these foods from your diet, and you don't know what is going to replace them yet. I've been vegan for seven years and now I just go to the supermarket like anyone else and pick up the foods I like, as anyone else would, but when I was first making the change it was definitely more difficult. 

&gt;One thing we recommend to people is to consider committing to cutting out all animal products from your diet 1-2 days a week. That way you can start finding new foods and alternatives that you enjoy and from there it becomes much easier to do 3,4,5 days a week after that!

The conversation varied a bit from person to person (they would usually give some of their own feedback in between my comments). I think the approach I used was very effective (I could tell people responded very positively to it), but because I didn't ever say to go outright vegan right away I didn't hear many people say they were going to do that.
