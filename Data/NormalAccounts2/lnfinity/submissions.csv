I hope it encourages some of you to become more active in volunteering and working to help animals.

[Sad but hopeful post about where we go from here]

If you think a Trump presidency is very bad, and last night surprised you, that's evidence that you might be too optimistic about the world. Sadly the world might just be worse than you think. Especially if other bad things like Brexit also surprised you. This matters.

Many effective altruists are really optimistic about the world. They aren't just optimistic in a hopeful sense, but in an empirical sense. They tend to think moral and social change will resolve themselves. And this makes sense. I mean, who doesn't want to believe ""the moral arc of the universe bends towards justice""?

I also believe this to an extent, but I worry about that optimism *a lot*, partly because my other foot is in the animal advocacy community. There, we really see the dark side of the world. We see the 100 billion animals raised and killed for food every year, and the countless wild animals out there, as individuals. The confinement, the disease, the minutes of being ripped limb from limb and other horrifically tragic deaths. Perhaps more importantly, we see thoughtful, kind people ignore this suffering. Very smart people will say incredibly dumb things to justify eating animals, and often these people are the hardest to get on board. If we shed our optimism, the standard EA project of ensuring civilization's continued existence probably becomes significantly less promising relative to improving the quality of sentient life.

That being said, we can (and should, imo) be very optimistic in the hopeful sense. One thing last night showed us is that people are fickle. Charismatic leaders and well-organized campaigns can mold and bend social attitudes and behaviors to an amazing degree.

When my animal advocacy friends ask me how I'm so happy all the time, this is it. I appreciate how bad the world is in absolute terms, but I focus on the incredible impact we can make with our effort and resources, by organizing and campaigning for moral progress. Realizing the impact one person can have with just a few minutes of their time, or a few dollars given to the most effective charities, gets me out of bed in the morning, especially mornings like this one.",vegan,Thoughts on the Election from one of Animal Charity Evaluators' Researchers,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/5c3dup/thoughts_on_the_election_from_one_of_animal/
139,2016-11-09 17:54:19+00:00,self.progressive,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/5c2ka3/best_candidate_for_2020_cory_booker/,False,"In light of last night’s election results I’ve been reading a bit about Cory Booker. Here are a few snippets from his [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Booker#Early_life.2C_education.2C_and_early_career):

&gt;Booker graduated from Northern Valley Regional High School at Old Tappan and was named to the 1986 USA Today All-USA high school football team. Booker went on to Stanford University, receiving a Bachelor of Arts in political science in 1991 and a Master of Arts in sociology the following year. While at Stanford, he played football as a tight end and was teammates with Brad Muster and Ed McCaffrey, and also made the All–Pacific-10 Academic team and was elected senior class president. In addition, Booker ran The Bridge Peer Counseling Center, a student-run crisis hotline, and organized help from Stanford students for youth in East Palo Alto, California. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;After Stanford, Booker was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to study at the University of Oxford, where he earned an honors degree in United States history in 1994 as a member of The Queen's College. He earned his Juris Doctor in 1997 from Yale Law School, where he operated free legal clinics for low-income residents of New Haven, Connecticut. At Yale, Booker was a founding member of the Chai Society (now the Eliezer Society), was a Big Brother with Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, and was active in the National Black Law Students Association. 

All USA high school football team, All-Pac-10 Academic Team, BS and MA from Stanford, Rhodes Scholarship to study at Oxford, Juris Doctor from Yale, and on top of all this he ran a crisis hotline, organized help for students in underserved communities, provided free legal services, and was a Big Brother. Is there anything he can’t do? Well it gets better once he was elected mayor of Newark:

&gt;Booker is a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, a bipartisan group with a stated goal of ""making the public safer by getting illegal guns off the streets"". Booker was honored in October 2009 by the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence with the Sarah Brady Visionary Award for his work in reducing gun violence. During his mayoralty, crime dropped significantly in Newark, which led the nation in violent crime reduction from 2006 to 2008. March 2010 marked Newark's first murder-free month in over 44 years, although murder and overall crime rates began to rise again after 2008. In addition to his crime-lowering initiatives, Booker doubled the amount of affordable housing under development and quadrupled the amount under pre-development, and reduced the city budget deficit from $180 million to $73 million.
 
&amp;nbsp;

&gt;After taking office, Booker voluntarily reduced his own salary twice, reducing his salary by 8% early in his first year as mayor. He also raised the salaries of many city workers. However, his administration imposed one-day-a-month furloughs for all non-uniformed employees from July through December 2010, as well as 2% pay cuts for managers and directors earning more than $100,000 a year. In 2008 and 2009 the City of Newark received the Government Finance Officers Association's Distinguished Budget Presentation Award. In an effort to make government more accessible, Booker has held regular open office hours during which city residents can meet with him personally to discuss their concerns. In 2010, Booker was among the finalists for the World Mayor prize, ultimately placing seventh. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the 2012 award.

The guy is also a genuinely good person:

&gt;Booker gained national attention when, on December 28, 2010, a constituent used Twitter to ask him to send someone to her father's house to shovel his driveway because her elderly father was going to attempt to do it himself. Booker responded by tweeting, ""I will do it myself; where does he live?"" Other people volunteered, including one person who offered his help on Twitter, and 20 minutes later Booker and some volunteers showed up and shoveled the man's driveway. On April 12, 2012, Booker saved a woman from a house fire, suffering smoke inhalation and second-degree burns on his hands in the process. Newark Fire Chief John Centanni said that Booker's actions possibly saved the woman's life. After Hurricane Sandy destroyed much of the shoreline areas of New Jersey and New York in late October 2012, Booker invited Newarkers without power to eat and sleep in his home. In February 2013, responding to a Twitter post, Booker helped a nervous constituent propose to his girlfriend. Booker rescued a dog from freezing temperatures in January 2013 and another dog that had been abandoned in a cage in July 2013.

I know it is way too early to start speculating at this point, but I am very much hoping to see Cory Booker run for President in 2020.",progressive,Best Candidate for 2020: Cory Booker,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/5c2ka3/best_candidate_for_2020_cory_booker/

195,2016-11-03 19:39:30+00:00,self.vegan,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/5ayw2e/the_humane_league_secures_huge_victory_for_animals/,False,"About a month ago, The Humane League launched a campaign against Aramark, the second largest food service company in the United States, to get them to commit to making changes that would improve the lives of the millions of chickens slaughtered and served by them each year. The Humane League’s executive director did [an AMA](https://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/54wpqq/im_david_comanhidy_executive_director_of_the/) shortly after the start of the campaign.

The campaign has had widespread support. The Humane League’s [Fast Action Network](http://www.thehumaneleague.com/fast-action-network/) helped to spread awareness through social media, university groups across the country started petitions to get Aramark removed as the food service provider at their university if Aramark did not adopt the changes, thousands of letters and e-mails were sent to board members of Aramark’s clients, and protests were held outside of Aramark’s headquarters. 

Today Aramark made a [huge announcement](http://www.aramark.com/about-us/news/aramark-general/broiler-chicken-commitment) agreeing that they will ask their suppliers to take the following actions by 2024, or sooner if possible:

* Transitioning to strains of birds that measurably improve welfare issues associated with fast growth rates per Global Animal Partnership’s (GAP) standards. 
* Reducing maximum stocking density to equal to/less than 6 lbs./sq. ft. per GAP standards.
* Providing chickens with enriched environments including natural light, hay bales and perches that meet GAP standards.
* Evaluating with animal welfare organizations over the next year issues related to litter quality, lighting, air quality, and other environmental conditions. 
* Rendering chickens unconscious prior to shackling using Controlled or Low Atmosphere Stunning. 

_____________________________________________________________

Announcements like this do not happen in a vacuum. As we saw with the campaign that has succeeded in getting nearly every major retailer, restaurant, or food service company to pledge to eliminate battery cages in the last four years (most of them have pledged to complete the transition by 2025), each company that pledges to improve conditions puts immense pressure on their competitors to make a similar pledge to improving conditions.

Accordingly, shortly after Aramark made their announcement, the largest food service company in the United States, Compass Group, made a similar [announcement](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/compass-group-usa-becomes-first-food-service-company-to-commit-to-100-healthier-slower-growing-chicken-by-2024-through-landmark-global-animal-partnership-agreement-300356873.html?tc=eml_cleartime) in which they also agree to switch to strains of chickens that grow slower to improve health, add enrichments including hay bales, perches, and natural light, lower stocking density to no more than 6 lbs/square foot, and render chickens unconscious prior to slaughter using a method of Controlled Atmosphere Killing by 2024.

Combined these two commitments will improve the lives of hundreds of millions of individuals each year, will make it easier for plant-based protein options to compete as superior alternatives for food service companies to implement, and will set a precedent for even more companies to adopt similar changes.

If you’d like to help future campaigns like this one succeed, please sign up to participate with The Humane League’s [Fast Action Network](http://www.thehumaneleague.com/fast-action-network/) (they will send you no more than one e-mail each day with a couple easy things you can do, usually online, to help their campaigns), and consider [making a donation to The Humane League](http://www.thehumaneleague.com/donate/), which is one of the [top charities recommended by Animal Charity Evaluators](http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/recommendations/top-charities/)!

GARY IS NOT MADE WITH DAIRY. Call it Adolf or something don’t call it Gary because IT’S NOT GARY!!!!!! Just to recap incase you have forgotten --- Gary is nutritious food made mostly from the proteins and fats in plants, but also other non-animals like mushrooms and yeast. Around 4000 years ago people have started to forcefully impregnate animals and steal their babies to take the gross liquid that comes out of their infected nipples after giving birth. That’s when dairy was born. So Sainsburys can F off. Go enjoy your Gary less life. Don’t try to make up a substitute Gary and call it Gary because it’s not and you’ve decided your way of life. It’s ridiculous that they’ve used the word Gary!!! Don’t come to my Gary and Wine parties if you’re going to eat DAIRY GARY. (If you’re allergic to Gary I feel for you) if you’re a Carnist because you’ve chosen to be and not that you’re allergic I’m not interested in your views about dairy Gary or that ‘eating products from animals is okay for all the reasons everyone knows about’ the point here is you’re not eating Gary you’re eating curdled breast milk.",vegancirclejerk,DON'T CALL DAIRY GARY!!!!,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegancirclejerk/comments/55dozq/dont_call_dairy_gary/

They have earned this distinction by running very effective corporate campaigns that have succeeded in getting companies from McDonalds to Walmart to commit to completely eliminating the sale or use of eggs that come from hens in battery cages. 

Yesterday, The Humane League has launched what is potentially their largest campaign yet against Aramark, the food service giant that runs cafeterias in schools, universities, hospitals, national parks, sports stadiums, and much more. Numerous undercover investigations have uncovered terrible treatment of broiler chickens that are slaughtered and served by Aramark. These broiler chickens are raised in cramped conditions with roughly the space of a single sheet of paper per bird, the sheds house hundreds of thousands of birds where waste is not cleaned out for the entire lives of the birds, they have been bred to grow much faster than their legs can withstand so broken legs and death due to not being able to reach water is common, and finally the birds are agonizingly slaughtered in the cheapest and most expeditious manner possible. The Humane League is asking Aramark to commit to holding their suppliers to substantive animal care standards that will eliminate some of the worst animal abuse the currently exists.

Due to the size of Aramark this has the potential to impact the lives of roughly 100 million animals per year (I don't have the exact numbers for Aramark), and would likely set precedent that could ultimately impact the lives of close to 9 billion birds per year across the United States. This would be the largest victory for animals in the history of the animal rights movement, so I hope you head over to /r/iama to check it out and help the campaign asking Aramark to adopt changes in any way you can!

________________________________________

Jacy Reese from Animal Charity Evaluators will be doing an AMA on /r/vegan starting at 9AM PDT (16:00 UTC) on Friday, July 22nd. I’m very excited for this AMA as Jacy is someone in the movement who I have looked up to and whose work I have admired for a while now. He has written about animal rights issues from cultured meat, to wild animal suffering, to the importance of donating to the best animal charities for [Salon](http://www.salon.com/2016/02/13/this_animal_doesnt_want_to_die_please_think_about_not_eating_him_for_dinner/) , [Vox](http://www.vox.com/2015/12/14/9873012/wild-animals-suffering), and the [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacy-reese/how-can-you-help-animals_b_8911384.html), and he also does in-depth research on strategies for the animal rights movement such as the importance of legal change for [Animal Charity Evaluators](https://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/the-relationship-between-legal-and-social-change/). 

I actually got to meet Jacy at the Animal Rights National Conference in Los Angeles earlier this month. I was sitting down browsing reddit on my phone and he walked up to me:

**Jacy**: Are you Lnfinity from reddit?

**Me**: Yes!

**Jacy**: I’m…

**Me**: Jacy Reese! I’m a big fan of your work. I actually have Google Alerts set up with your name so I can stay on top of everything you publish!

Somehow I didn’t scare him away with that over-enthusiastic introduction; I got to chat with him about an article he was writing that the time, and he agreed to join us for an AMA.

Jacy has years of research and experience in the animal rights movement under his belt and can answer questions about anything from living with chickens (he has two rescued hens who I [follow on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/snowwantstolive/)), to the best techniques for getting your family to go vegan, to how the movement as a whole should strategize in order to create a vegan world.",vegan,Animal Charity Evaluators Researcher Jacy Reese will be doing an AMA on Friday!,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/4ts8qa/animal_charity_evaluators_researcher_jacy_reese/

Just start finding items or completing tasks on the [Scavenger Hunt List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p9FJzNGW7s2qDe8wkXWuaGmGqA10Oe_4zecl7tyFqBw/pubhtml), and post the pictures or videos you took to document the completion to this subreddit to be awarded points (and to show off your skills).

There are some [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/SummerScavengerHunt/wiki/rules) clarifying the details about how things can be completed, but the general rule is you can't cause things in the first half of the list (titled ""Find"") to happen, you have to just find them. Whereas the second half of the list (titled ""Achieve"") is things that you can do yourself.

You can compete as a single individual or as a team of two people. When you make your first submission the moderators will ask you who your teammate is. If you haven't decided yet you can always message us later to have a teammate added.",SummerScavengerHunt,How to Get Started,https://www.reddit.com/r/SummerScavengerHunt/comments/4m5stf/how_to_get_started/

I was taught by my father, and he by his father before him that we are to respect all animals by not eating them, and that hummus is the force by which vegans gain their strength, their wisdom, and their unrivaled self-righteousness. So it was in the beginning...

Then the war broke out. The infidels worshiped false avocado gods. Countless plants lost their lives in the war between the righteous followers of hummus and the guacamole idolizing heathen. The streets ran red with beet juice.

Alas, it seemed that the factions of veganism were irreconcilably fractured. But when all hope seemed lost, one recipe brought promise to reunite the broken realm. Could one recipe restore harmony between the warring houses of vegans? Could a recipe of such power be wielded by the likes of mortals?

*One recipe to rule them all*

*One recipe to find them*

*One recipe to bring them all*

*And in the darkness, bind them*

Slavery is the system that stripped my ancestors of their pride and possessions and brought them to this country in chains. Slavery is the system that forced my ancestors to live without freedom and work without compensation for generations. Slavery is the system that created so many of the inequalities African Americans still encounter today. Understanding the horrific impact of slavery is why I agreed to be the Goodwill Ambassador for a UN memorial honoring the victims of the transatlantic slave trade. I wanted to do my part to ensure that something as devastating to the human condition as slavery will never happen again. Just as I want to ensure that something as devastating to both the human and the animal condition as eating animal products is ultimately judged just as harshly as slavery is today.

&gt;In the way I make comparisons between the meat industrial complex and slavery, others have made the same comparisons with Nazism. As unpopular as those comparisons might be, they need to be made as well. Consider the words of Holocaust survivor—and vegan-- Alex Hershaft, who told the Jewish Journal he couldn’t help but see the parallels between the meat industry and the Nazi Holocaust, including “the crowding, cattle cars, brutality and the routine and efficiency of mass extermination....I echo the wisdom of famed Yiddish writer Isaac Bashevis Singer: ‘For the animals, life is an eternal Treblinka,’” referring to the Nazi concentration camp.

&gt;Speaking of Singer, if you’re not familiar, he was an iconic Jewish writer who grew up in a Warsaw ghetto and fled to America on the eve of the Holocaust. In his classic book Enemies: A Love Story, he describes the reaction of one of his characters, a Jewish survivor of the Holocaust, to watching an animal killed for its meat:

&gt;&gt;As often as Herman had witnessed the slaughter of animals and fish, he always had the same thought: in their behavior towards creatures, all men were Nazis. The smugness with which man could do with other species as he pleased exemplified the most extreme racist theories, the principle that might is right.

&gt;Singer didn’t write those words lightly— he was a European Jew who understood all too well just how cruel and inhumane the Nazi mentality was. Who spent most of his life trying to make sense of the damage the Nazis did to his family and his world. When he writes, “in their behavior towards creatures, all men were Nazis,” you can feel the pain of that truth.

&gt;Notice that Singer didn’t say that people are Nazi’s all the time, but rather than just in how they treat animals. It’s a crucial distinction and really gets to the heart of what I’m trying to convey in this section. Eating animals does not make you terrible person. It does not make you a Nazi. Or a slave trader.

&gt;It does, however, represent some of our most unconscious behavior. Our unconscious mind that can make us blind to another being’s suffering. That allows us to hold on to racist theories. That allows us put our own perceived needs over the common good.

&gt;“The worst sin toward our fellow creatures is not to hate them, but to be indifferent to them: that's the essence of inhumanity."" George Bernard Shaw.

&gt;Breaking out of that sort of unconscious mind set is why I go to yoga. Why I practice meditation. And yes, why I don’t eat animal products.",vegan,"Excerpt from Russell Simmons' book ""The Happy Vegan""",https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/44bgxt/excerpt_from_russell_simmons_book_the_happy_vegan/

They will say you are naive and foolhardy. You are not. They will tell you to get a life. Few people live a more meaningful one. 

You are heroes for a cause as important as any in the history of the world — the systematic and needless confinement, torture, and slaughter of billions of animals, the destruction of our environment causing global climate change, millions of people dying from human health conditions caused by eating animals and the effects of industrial farming, and millions more dying of starvation because grain that could save them is wasted on animals. 

You are fighting against enormous odds, including a foe in the powerful agricultural industry that will spare no expense to continue duping the public into believing a web of lies about the realities of eating animals and the nature of agribusiness.

When the thought of the suffering becomes too much to bear, know that your passion offers hope, your activism has changed and saved lives, and you are not alone. Keep holding those signs, keep handing out leaflets, keep sharing those videos, keep boycotting, keep talking to your friends and family, keep signing petitions, keep calling your legislators, keep educating yourself, keep holding fundraisers, keep supporting animal sanctuaries and other non-profit animal rescue organizations, and keep making the world a more humane place. 

Don’t stop. Don’t ever stop. You’re making a difference. The world is changing. You’re changing it.",vegan,I found these inspirational words on Facebook; I hope they encourage you too.,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/40bhmk/i_found_these_inspirational_words_on_facebook_i/

Researchers from the DeVry Institute compared the environmental footprint of water and bacon on a per-calorie basis and revealed that bacon fared better than water on every metric. 

Bacon lovers have rejoiced over the news. “For ages non-bacon eaters have lorded their choices over our heads. They say, ‘Pigs want to live too. Gestation crates are cruel to animals. Cutting off pigs testicles without anesthesia is abuse. Manure runoff is creating dead zones in our waterways.  The overuse of antibiotics on factory farms to promote growth is reducing the effectiveness medically necessary antibiotics. Processed meats cause cancer.’” Says Bradley Connors, Assistant President of the Donner Indiana Bacon Lovers Society. “This study finally allows us to put those high-and-mighty water drinkers in their place.”

We reached out to the authors of the study who had this to say, “The purpose of the study had nothing to do with the environmental impact of water. We compared the bacon-heavy standard American diet to the fish and dairy-laden diet that is recommended by the FDA, and determined that the recommendations for fish and dairy contributed to a particularly large environmental footprint. Water is a component of dairy, and given the lack of calories in water it is always going to have a larger footprint on a per-calorie basis than any food we compare it to.” 

 Bradley Connors celebrated the news by downing 18 strips of bacon. “Our fresh water resources are rapidly becoming depleted. It is nice finally knowing that these 18 strips of bacon only took 1,200 gallons of water to produce (that’s just 28 bathtubs full), while it would take more than 12,000 gallons to get the same number of calories from drinking water.”

We were unable to reach someone who survives on only water for comment on this piece.

They were told that she was a micro pig who would not grow to more than 70 lbs. To their surprise she has grown to over 600 lbs and her dads' love has only grown with her.

Steve and Derek began posting pictures and videos of Esther online and her incredible personality quickly attracted thousands of fans. In order to provide help to many more animals like Esther they started a sanctuary, Happily Ever Esther, that would provide a safe place to live for other animals in need with the help of donations from Esther's many fans. 

In May of 2015 Happily Ever Esther Farm Sanctuary opened in Ontario, Canada. Steve and Derek have continued to share videos of Esther and her new friends, giving the nearly a million fans of Esther a better chance to learn their incredible personalities.

[Here's an article written by a former pig farmer about Esther](http://www.salon.com/2015/05/03/esther_the_wonder_pig_is_wondrous_indeed_special_but_so_are_all_pigs/):

&gt;Scrolling through Esther’s social media accounts and her website, you can see pictures of Esther in the house lounging on her bed, on Derek and Steve’s bed, or on the couch (she is quite the lounger), and of her snuggling with her canine siblings (with her feline siblings nearby – feigning feline aloofness, of course). You can also see pictures and videos of her hamming (again, the good kind) it up as she sits or stands, waiting patiently with that pretty pig smile on her face for a treat like pies, often homemade by her loving humans. You can also see Esther running and playing in the backyard. You can see her being mischievous, and, as any 600-pound adolescent will do, wreaking havoc. The videos and pictures are captivating. They are simply a joy to watch. I never tire of them. I love Esther.

**My 5 Questions:**

1. Why do you think Esther likes to pick large sticks/branches to bring home? What sorts of sticks does she seem to think are the best?
2. Why haven't you built Esther a bigger pool to swim in during the summer?
3. How has knowing Esther changed your views toward other animals?
4. What is a typical day like at the sanctuary? 
5. What do the different pigs on the sanctuary share in common and what differs between each of their personalities?

I will never see the sun rise, I will never see it set,

I will never feel a kind touch, I will never be a pet.

&amp;nbsp;

I will never feel love, for I will not be loved,

As I’m led to my murder, being prodded, poked and shoved.

&amp;nbsp;

As they cut my tender skin, I wondered who would care,

If anybody out there, would consider my despair.

&amp;nbsp;

For you did not see me die, and you did not see me bleed,

You did not hear me cry, for the meat that you don’t need.

&amp;nbsp;

You did not watch them kill me, you could not feel my pain,

You will try not to think of me, as you blindly eat again.

&amp;nbsp;

I was the cow you ate on Monday, the pig you had midweek,

I was the turkey for your Christmas, I was the calf you liked to eat.

&amp;nbsp;

I was the chicken in your sandwich, the duck you had for tea,

I felt pain beyond belief, but you never thought of me.

&amp;nbsp;

Because thinking can be painful, and you refuse to see,

That for every time you eat meat, those animals must bleed.

&amp;nbsp;

The cow was killed for Monday, the pig was scalded too,

The turkey lived for 16 weeks, and the calf had died for you.

&amp;nbsp;

The chicken lived inside a cage, the duck could hardly move,

And all of this suffering, occurred for so-called food.

&amp;nbsp;

I fail to see a reason, as there is no need,

When humans eat my meat, it is purely for their greed.

&amp;nbsp;

You may think you’re above me, that you have advantage,

But a kind, innocent creature, is better than a savage.

&amp;nbsp;

So next time you’re out shopping, try to feel some guilt,

For those animals have died, for your eggs, your meat and milk.

&amp;nbsp;

My heroes are those people, who will not bite into me,

So I ask a simple favor, and please stop eating meat.

&amp;nbsp;

I’m asking for the cows, the pigs and all the sheep,

I’m asking for the birds, who are more than just some meat.

&amp;nbsp;

They can’t speak themselves, so please lets be their voice,

Every one born into this, for them there was no choice.

&amp;nbsp;

For you did not see me die, and you did not see me bleed,

You did not hear me cry, for the meat that you don’t need.",vegetarian,Slaughterhouse Poem - Anonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/3k3qpp/slaughterhouse_poem_anonymous/

These pictures aren't unusual. There are hundreds of pictures from many different trucks, and the animals regularly show up looking like this. 

How does this not prompt an investigation for animal abuse? These animals are clearly injured, and even if it wasn't the farmers beating the animals themselves (which we know is far too common), they are clearly responsible for leaving the animals in completely inexcusable conditions if it leads to this kind of injury. Can't we pressure government officials so that when this kind of abuse is witnessed by inspectors that it actually gets investigated like the kind of criminal abuse that it really is?",vegan,I follow a group on Facebook that takes pictures of trucks arriving at slaughterhouses,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/3jmm0m/i_follow_a_group_on_facebook_that_takes_pictures/

###Instructions

1. In a large pot over medium heat, sweat onions in 1 Tbsp oil and season with a healthy pinch each salt and pepper. Stir and continue cooking on medium heat until translucent and soft.

2. Add sweet potato and any desired spices at this time (I went for chili, cinnamon, cumin and chipotle powder - all are optional). Cook for 3 minutes, then add salsa, water and vegetable stock.

3. Bring mixture to a low boil on medium high heat and then lower heat to medium-low and simmer. Add black beans, cover and cook for at least 20 minutes more, preferably 30 - or until the sweet potatoes are fork tender and the soup and thickened. This soup is at its best when prepared the night before or allowed to rest for a few hours so the flavor marries with the vegetables and beans.

4. Serve with fresh cilantro, onion, avocado and lime juice. Chips make an excellent spoon.",recipes,Black Bean Chili,https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/3iywx3/black_bean_chili/

Dear Esther, 

Three years ago today we met you for the very first time. I'll never forget the way you trembled and looked up at me from the laundry basket you were delivered in. Your tiny little sunburned ears, and those chipped pink nail polished toes. You looked so sad! 

I took you home much to your other dads surprise, and although he wasn't very happy with me for a few days the magic of ""The Esther Effect"" was already at work. We watched you play with the dogs, run to your toy box and shake your little head like crazy with your teddy bears. We cuddled while you fell asleep and we taught you the rules of the house....which you broke constantly in your own hilarious way. We would laugh and play, forgetting entirely what was going on around us. It was only a matter of time before that amazing smile did its thing. You had completely stolen our hearts. 

But in the process you also took something else from us, our ability to ignore what you were born for. We learned what it meant that you had a stubby little tail and that you were in fact not the mini pig we thought you were. We had never given it a second thought before, but all of a sudden we found ourselves making the connection. You were supposed to spend the first three years of your life in a crate delivering baby after baby that would be taken from you. Then before long, you yourself would've been taken away when you grew too tired to produce. You were supposed to be someone's dinner, someone who like us didn't realize the intelligent, emotional, and sensitive animal you are. 

Although we take comfort knowing we made that connection, and that you're safe and always will be; I'm sorry we participated in this and that it took us so long to realize that we could do better. I'm sorry for the horrible things people do to your kind in a hell on earth that we created for you, and I'm most sorry that you never got the chance to know your mom, your dad, or any of your beautiful brothers and sisters. We would give anything for the chance to reunite you. 

We hope you take comfort in knowing you're helping to open hearts and minds every single day, and we hope you know how much you are loved. You made us the people we are today, and we will forever be grateful for the day we met you on that chilly August morning in 2012. 

Thank you for being a daily source of inspiration and smiles, you make even the hardest days happy. 

Love you so much noodle.

Dear Esther, 

Three years ago today we met you for the very first time. I'll never forget the way you trembled and looked up at me from the laundry basket you were delivered in. Your tiny little sunburned ears, and those chipped pink nail polished toes. You looked so sad! 

I took you home much to your other dads surprise, and although he wasn't very happy with me for a few days the magic of ""The Esther Effect"" was already at work. We watched you play with the dogs, run to your toy box and shake your little head like crazy with your teddy bears. We cuddled while you fell asleep and we taught you the rules of the house....which you broke constantly in your own hilarious way. We would laugh and play, forgetting entirely what was going on around us. It was only a matter of time before that amazing smile did its thing. You had completely stolen our hearts. 

But in the process you also took something else from us, our ability to ignore what you were born for. We learned what it meant that you had a stubby little tail and that you were in fact not the mini pig we thought you were. We had never given it a second thought before, but all of a sudden we found ourselves making the connection. You were supposed to spend the first three years of your life in a crate delivering baby after baby that would be taken from you. Then before long, you yourself would've been taken away when you grew too tired to produce. You were supposed to be someone's dinner, someone who like us didn't realize the intelligent, emotional, and sensitive animal you are. 

Although we take comfort knowing we made that connection, and that you're safe and always will be; I'm sorry we participated in this and that it took us so long to realize that we could do better. I'm sorry for the horrible things people do to your kind in a hell on earth that we created for you, and I'm most sorry that you never got the chance to know your mom, your dad, or any of your beautiful brothers and sisters. We would give anything for the chance to reunite you. 

We hope you take comfort in knowing you're helping to open hearts and minds every single day, and we hope you know how much you are loved. You made us the people we are today, and we will forever be grateful for the day we met you on that chilly August morning in 2012. 

Thank you for being a daily source of inspiration and smiles, you make even the hardest days happy. 

Love you so much noodle.

#Ingredients

**Rice**

* 1 cup low sodium vegetable broth (240 mL)
* 1/2 cup dry long grain brown rice (72 g)
* 1/8 teaspoon fine sea salt

**Soup**

* 6 cups low sodium vegetable broth (1440 mL)
* 1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped (160 g, you will need 1 cup)
* 4 large garlic cloves, minced (you will need a heaping tablespoon)
* 2 Roma tomatoes, roughly chopped (about 2 cups)
* 1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
* Salt and pepper (I added 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper)
*  Optional: I love a little heat to everything, so I added a heaping tsp chili powder, or chili flakes would work too)
* 2 15 oz cans white beans, drained and rinsed
* 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh basil

#Instructions

1. In a medium pot, prepare the rice first by bringing 1 cup broth to a boil and then add the rice, salt and stir and immediately turn to the lowest heat setting and cover. Simmer for 20 minutes or until all the broth is evaporated. Return the lid and let it sit covered 10 minutes.

2. While the rice is cooking, chop your vegetables. Add the 6 cups broth to a large pot with only the onion, garlic, Italian seasoning, salt, pepper and chili powder. Stir well and bring to a boil. Once boiling, turn down to medium-high and cover and cook for 10 minutes.

3. Now add the tomatoes, cover and cook on medium-low for another 10 minutes.

4. Lastly, add the drained beans, fresh basil and cooked rice. Stir well and bring back to a boil. Once boiling, let it cook on high for 5-10 more mins until heated through. Taste and add any additional spices if necessary, I didn't add anymore.

**Ingredients**

**For the bacon:**

* 3 portobello mushrooms, rinsed and patted dry
* ¾ cup maple syrup
* ⅓ cup liquid smoke
* Salt and pepper to taste

**For the siracha mayo:**

* 1 cup cashews, soaked for at least 4 hours and drained
* 2-3 tablespoons siracha sauce, depending on taste
* ¼-1/3 cup water

**For the sliders:**

* 6-8 rolls or pieces of bread, whichever you prefer
* Siracha mayo
* Mixed greens

**Directions**

1. To make the bacon: Stir together the maple syrup and liquid smoke in a wide, flat bowl, set aside. Slice the portobello mushrooms very thinkly, about ¼ inch thick and place in the bowl of marinade. Allow to sit for at least 15-20 minutes, moving around the slices as necessary so they all are submerged in the marinade. You may have to marinade them in batched, to make sure they all get a chance to soak up the liquid. Place a pan over medium heat and spray liberally with cooking spray or melt a teaspoon of coconut oil in the pan. When melted, cook the mushrooms slices for 2-3 minutes on each side, until they are dark golden brown, but not burnt. Cook in batches and allow to drain on a paper towel after they have been cooked.
2. To make the mayo: In a food processor or high powered blender, blend together the cashews, water and siracha, adding salt and pepper to taste and until mixture is smooth. Add more water is necessary.
3. To assemble: Spread both sides of the rolls cut in half with the mayo and place the back and greens on them.

**Ingredients**

* 1 can chickpeas, reserving a small handful for the avocado cream (you can cook dried ones as well)
* 3 cloves garlic
* 1 small onion
* 2 teaspoons ground cumin
* A BIG bunch of both fresh parsley and coriander
* Salt and pepper
* 2 Tablespoons olive oil
* 3/4 cup chickpea flour (sometimes called gram flour)
* Burger buns and fresh tomato for serving

**For the avocado cream and tahini mayo**

* 1 avocado
* A small handful chickpeas left from can
* A bunch of fresh parsley
* 1 garlic clove
* 2 tablespoons tahini
* The juice of one lemon
* 2 tablespoons water

**Directions**

Throw your chickpeas, peeled garlic, onion, cumin and salt and pepper into a food processor and pulse until roughly blended. You’ll need to scrape down the sides. Now add in the fresh herbs, oil and flour and blend until you have a nice thick texture, but it will still be fairly moist. Place into a bowl and if you need, add a little more flour to help the mixture bind as you form them into the patties. Make them small or big as you prefer. In a flat frying pan, heat about half an inch of oil over medium to high and add in your burgers. Cook for about 4 -5 minutes on both sides and once they are on their second turn, press them gently to make them flatter if you need. They should turn a nice dark, golden brown and smell divine!

For the avocado cream, simply add to your processor the avocado (without skin of course!), the remaining chickpeas, parsley and 1 garlic clove and blend until smooth. For the tahini mayo, drop the two tablespoons of tahini into a small bowl with the lemon juice and water and whisk with folk until you have a creamy consistency.

Toast the bun, add the burger, then the avocado, then a slice of tomato and finish with the oozy, lovely tahini mayo!",recipes,Falafel with Avocado Cream &amp; Tahini Mayo,http://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/3d58hl/falafel_with_avocado_cream_tahini_mayo/

**Ingredients**

* 2 garlic heads/bulbs, top quarter cut off to expose cloves
* 6 tbsp + 1 tsp olive oil
* pinch of fresh thyme leaves (optional)
* 1 head cauliflower (2 pounds)
* salt + pepper
* 2 tbsp lemon juice, plus extra
* 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, or to taste
* 1 pound brown rice pasta, such as penne or fusilli 
* 2-3 handfuls baby arugula
* 1/4 cup walnut halves, toasted + chopped

**Directions** 

Adjust an oven rack to the middle position, place a naked baking sheet on the rack and preheat to 500 degrees F. Tear two squares of aluminum foil and place cut garlic heads in the centers. Drizzle exposed garlic tops with 1/2 tsp olive oil each. Season with salt, pepper, and thyme leaves (if using). Wrap garlic bulbs up securely and place in the oven. Roast until garlic is browned and mushy/tender, about 40 minutes.

While garlic is roasting, trim the cauliflower leaves and the extra bit of stalk at the bottom. Cut the head right down the middle, from top to bottom. From there, cut each half into 4 wedges. In a medium bowl, toss the cauliflower wedges with 2 tablespoons olive oil, salt, and pepper. Remove the pre-heated baking sheet from the oven and carefully lay the cauliflower wedges onto the surface, leaving some space around each piece. You should hear sizzling. Roast cauliflower until tender and well-browned, about 25 minutes (I flipped mine halfway).

Once slightly cooled, transfer cauliflower to a cutting board and cut into bite-size pieces. Unwrap roasted garlic and squeeze cloves out into a small bowl. Mash roasted garlic with a fork to make a smooth puree. Whisk in the lemon juice, pepper flakes, some salt + pepper, and 1/4 cup of olive oil. Set aside.

Cook brown rice pasta according to package directions with a fat pinch of salt in the water. Reserve 1 cup of pasta cooking water before draining. Once drained, return cooked pasta to the pot. Add chopped cauliflower, garlic sauce, arugula, extra lemon juice to taste, and 1/4 cup reserved cooking water. Add more cooking water as necessary to achieve desired consistency.

* 1 15 oz can of black beans, rinsed and drained
* 1 cup cooked brown rice
* 3 cups roasted sweet potatoes, see recipe below
* 2 tablespoons chopped red onion
* 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro leaves
* ½ teaspoon salt
* ½ teaspoon cumin
* ½ teaspoon garlic powder
* ½ teaspoon smoked paprika
* ¼ teaspoon paprika
* Olive oil, for cooking
* 6 hamburger buns
* Burger toppings of your choice
* Jalapeno, to taste

**Roasted Sweet Potatoes:**

* 3 cups diced sweet potatoes
* 1 teaspoon olive oil
* ½ teaspoon cumin
* ½ teaspoon paprika
* ½ teaspoon garlic powder
* ½ teaspoon salt
* ¼ teaspoon pepper

**Curry Cilantro Mayo:**

* 1 cup Vegenaise or Just Mayo
* 1 and ¼ teaspoons curry powder
* 2 - 3 tablespoons finely chopped cilantro leaves
* 2 teaspoons lemon juice
* 1 pinch of salt

**Instructions**

1. Make the mayo: add all of the mayo ingredients to a medium sized bowl and stir until combined. Set aside.

2. Pre-heat the oven to 375 degrees F. On a large sheet pan, place the diced sweet potatoes, olive oil, and all the spices. Toss until sweet potatoes are coated and place into the pre-heated oven. Roast for about 25 minutes, flipping once, or until sweet potatoes are fork tender. Let cool for a few minutes.

3. Place all of the veggie burger ingredients into a food processor and process for about 3 - 5 seconds until everything is mixed together but still has some texture to it. Form patties (you should get about 6 of them depending on the size you make) and place them on a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Chill in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes.

4. Heat a large pan over medium heat and coat the bottom with a thin layer of olive oil. Place burgers in the hot pan and cook for about 10 minutes, flipping once, until burgers are heated through.

5. If grilling the burgers, grill over medium heat and rub a little bit of olive oil on the grill to ensure that the burgers don't stick.

**Ingredients**

* 1 15 oz can of black beans, rinsed and drained
* 1 cup cooked brown rice
* 3 cups roasted sweet potatoes, see recipe below
* 2 tablespoons chopped red onion
* 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro leaves
* ½ teaspoon salt
* ½ teaspoon cumin
* ½ teaspoon garlic powder
* ½ teaspoon smoked paprika
* ¼ teaspoon paprika
* Olive oil, for cooking
* 6 hamburger buns
* Burger toppings of your choice
* Jalapeno, to taste

**Roasted Sweet Potatoes:**

* 3 cups diced sweet potatoes
* 1 teaspoon olive oil
* ½ teaspoon cumin
* ½ teaspoon paprika
* ½ teaspoon garlic powder
* ½ teaspoon salt
* ¼ teaspoon pepper

**Curry Cilantro Mayo:**

* 1 cup Vegenaise or Just Mayo
* 1 and ¼ teaspoons curry powder
* 2 - 3 tablespoons finely chopped cilantro leaves
* 2 teaspoons lemon juice
* 1 pinch of salt

**Instructions**

1. Make the mayo: add all of the mayo ingredients to a medium sized bowl and stir until combined. Set aside.

2. Pre-heat the oven to 375 degrees F. On a large sheet pan, place the diced sweet potatoes, olive oil, and all the spices. Toss until sweet potatoes are coated and place into the pre-heated oven. Roast for about 25 minutes, flipping once, or until sweet potatoes are fork tender. Let cool for a few minutes.

3. Place all of the veggie burger ingredients into a food processor and process for about 3 - 5 seconds until everything is mixed together but still has some texture to it. Form patties (you should get about 6 of them depending on the size you make) and place them on a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Chill in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes.

4. Heat a large pan over medium heat and coat the bottom with a thin layer of olive oil. Place burgers in the hot pan and cook for about 10 minutes, flipping once, until burgers are heated through.

5. If grilling the burgers, grill over medium heat and rub a little bit of olive oil on the grill to ensure that the burgers don't stick.

6. Top veggie burgers with curry cilantro mayo and enjoy on a bun with toppings of your choice!",recipes,"Smokey Sweet Potato, Black Bean &amp; Brown Rice Veggie Burgers with Curry Cilantro Mayo",http://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/3c3sxm/smokey_sweet_potato_black_bean_brown_rice_veggie/

We also leafleted the line every morning before each show. On a typical day we distributed 3,000-5,000 pieces of literature, engaged in a couple hundred conversations, and raised between $800 and $2,000 for the non-profit Action for Animals. Several other redditors came for a day to help volunteer with us (I'll let them decide if they want to expose themselves). I had a lot of people tell me that they went vegetarian or vegan from something they had heard/read/seen at a prior year's Warped Tour show. 

One thing I noticed is that for many of our volunteers this was their first time engaging in any activism. They all did a great job, and their talents, if applied effectively, could spare the lives of hundreds of thousands even millions of animals. If you have any questions about getting involved in animal rights activism, please ask!

I'm happy to answer any other questions you have too. AMA!",vegan,I'm /u/lnfinity. I recently returned from a 10 day trip doing outreach at several Warped Tour shows. I also post on reddit sometimes. AMA!,http://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/3c0spg/im_ulnfinity_i_recently_returned_from_a_10_day/

&gt;Hold then the same view of the dog which has lost his master, which has sought him in all the thoroughfares with cries of sorrow, which comes into the house troubled and restless, goes downstairs, goes upstairs; goes from room to room, finds at last in his study the master he loves, and betokens his gladness by soft whimpers, frisks, and caresses. 

&gt;There are barbarians who seize this dog, who so greatly surpasses man in fidelity and friendship, and nail him down to a table and dissect him alive, to show you the Mesaraic veins! You discover in him all the same organs of feeling as in yourself. Answer me, Mechanist, has Nature arranged all the springs of feeling in this animal to the end that he might not feel? Has he nerves that he may be incapable of suffering? Do not suppose that impertinent contradiction in Nature.

-Voltaire, *Dictionnaire philosophique portatif* (1764)

Explanation: In the 17th Century, René Descartes had advocated the idea that animals were mere automatons, or complex machines, and that lacking a soul they could not suffer. Followers of Descartes ideas, who Voltaire and others referred to as Mechanists, conducted gruesome experiments on animals with little consideration for the unimaginable misery the animals were forced to endure. The quote above was Voltaire’s response to those who were conducting these experiments with no consideration for the well-being of the animals involved.",quotes,"""There are barbarians who seize this dog, nail him down to a table and dissect him alive! You discover in him all the same organs of feeling as in yourself.
