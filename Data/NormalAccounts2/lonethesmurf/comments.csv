49,"With Genji, you have to play like a sneaky harassing ninja.  You need to understand the area very well to plan your escape and know where the health packs are and which places you can climb for quick escapes. I seem to have the most success when my team is engaging the enemy and I can harass the backline with LMB. 

I usually have 2 mentalities when engaging depending on if I have ult or not.

1) With ult - I need to get into a position where I can ult and actually be able to use it without getting destroyed. If I happen to ult in the heat of battle I do so mid air after an attack. It helps if your team is also fighting the front line. Distractions are you friend.

2) No ult - look for squishy targets or targets that are holding your team back from pushing and try to take them out with LMB + SS.  For example a Widow or Mercy who keeps reviving. 

Remember to go in and out of fighting. You are a ninja, not a soldier. Use your mobility to keep changing your attack position. ",2016-07-18 17:04:49+00:00,d5gzzmi,1,t3_4tfd4g,10412,Overwatch

148,"I love this show but there are some things that do bug me that they force feed us just to move the plot. I know sometimes there is no time but there are so many options that are more sound and make more sense.

So lets go with Barry making noise.  He was already moving at god knows how fast to then possible hit something to trigger a vibration in the air to make noise that would pass Barry in speed to then reach the 2 in the room then for them to react to the noise.

They make his speed too inconsistent with human reflex. I just throw it to lazy writing. For example, a more sensible approach would be that he setup a defense system in case he was tracked down by someone. Such as locking the door, or closing said door.

And you know what I will give the first round Barry made noise. He was running slower than the second. Fine.  The second time tho he was running faster. I don't even know why the villain dropped his ability if he was trying to catch The Flash anyways. Shit is just dumbed down.
