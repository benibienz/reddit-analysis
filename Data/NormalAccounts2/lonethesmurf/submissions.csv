Big fan of Genji. Played many hours as him. I've come to learn and understand that his play style is an assassin.

So naturally you sneak around, poke from the sides, and ambush from the back. He requires a lot of patience and timing when deciding to go in with your ult.

A problem that I have come across is when he sheathes his sword (end of ult). You can't use any of your abilities and it will cancel your deflect if your ult runs out during deflects duration, which many times it has caused my unfortunate death.

It is such a bummer to have yourself unable to fight mid combat because your ult ran out.  All I can do is run or die. Most likely die since I would have already taken a few hits.

TL:DR - the ending of Genji's ult prevents and stops all his abilities.",Overwatch,Genji: Sheathing is death,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/4lbh3f/genji_sheathing_is_death/

So it won't feel as long taming ur dino from knocking it out and you feel more rewarded for actually taking it out with you on adventures.

So instead of just sitting and waiting hours doing nothing, you can break it down some and add some action into it.

* **Tier 1:** Initial tame after knocking them out.
* **Tier 2:** They follow where you go but won't trust you enough to let you mount them.
* **Tier 3:** Enough adventures and companionship has granted you the trust needed to mount

**To add more challenge**
the first tier of taming you can make it into an event like where it can be attacked by a pack of something or 1 something and you have to defend the knocked out dino by either killing or some how making it lose interest (throw poop at it a few times, use some lure to draw another dino into area)  


I know they are working on ideas with prime meat attracting carnivores.  
  


Let me know what you guys think.  ",playark,(Suggestion) Tiers for Taming and Events while Taming,http://www.reddit.com/r/playark/comments/3d9w00/suggestion_tiers_for_taming_and_events_while/
