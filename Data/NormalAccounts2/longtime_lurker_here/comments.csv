0,Bayley vs. Jax was longer than the match at The End. Glad to see they are giving Nia an amazing feud w/ Bayley. Hopefully they face each other at the PPV!,2016-06-25 02:59:01+00:00,d4n44cd,1,t3_4ppmc4,15987,SquaredCircle

7,"Although most comments are ""I have a bad feeling about this"", it stirs up some competition between brands and saves room for the big PPV's like Royal Rumble and Mania. Nothing bad about this, with the Network the ideology of PPV's has changed. If the price isn't going up, what's the harm in giving it a chance?",2016-06-12 23:12:43+00:00,d46lla6,1,t3_4nsqju,1206,SquaredCircle

17,"I don't know her personally, but my mom has a cousin who lives in Colorado and is part of a small religious community. Apparently, their life is completely restricted until the age of 15, then they are completely free to do whatever. Some odd things I have heard are:  

* They are not allowed to do ANYTHING sexual whatsoever, however they have 12 cheat days a year. Basically, you pick your days you want to touch yourself...and they have no problem with this.  

* They have mass in the complete nude. Not joking.  

* The weirdest one I have heard, apparently there is a ritual where when the kids reach 15 years old, they have a party of some sort and everybody takes hallucinogenic drugs.  

* The icing on the cake -- they are not allowed to know the name of the religion before 15. So creepy.  

I wish I could say I was making this up, but I am not. There may be more details, but my mother doesn't like to talk about it a lot. Definitely the weirdest thing I have ever heard a family do.
