0,"The fix is probably in.  NBA needs an interesting series.  A GS win in game 6 and people will look down on the Finals as a whole.  A series that was extended by a soft suspension to a key player, which was otherwise not close.  They'll need a game 7 so fans get tricked into thinking the series was good.

1,The Germans also did a ton of building under the guise of infrastructure.  Built lots of buildings that they told the world were schools but were actually factories to build up their military.  ,2016-06-08 12:47:45+00:00,d40seyw,1,t3_4n44o9,13050,explainlikeimfive

5,I don't sim away games because injuries and bad results happen far too often.  I'll sim the occasional league game with a Champions game or rival game later in the week just so I can play those sooner.  I'll also strategically sim home games towards the end of the season if the results don't really matter.  ,2016-04-29 13:31:28+00:00,d2m11ok,1,t3_4gyv8a,9019,FifaCareers

12,"I'm glad Jerome is dead.  No Joker is good without a Batman.  The balance between the two characters is what makes the Joker and Batman so compelling.  Without Batman, the Joker is just a more dynamic Zsasz.  

Just noticed this but, shouldn't we have known Jerome wasn't going to make it?  Look at all the promos for season 2, you see Theo, his sister, and Barbara, no Jerome.  

Also, welcome back Bullock.  ",2015-10-07 12:49:54+00:00,cvr78q9,1,t3_3nn3up,132713,Gotham
