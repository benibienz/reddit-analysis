I've started to build a long term team by adding longer promising players while maintaining most of the original 11.  My issue is with Aubameyang.  I can't seem to do anything with him.  I'm 15ish games into the season and he's score maybe 3 goals.  Some of it is my inability to finish, but as a test, I played Timo Werner instead of him and he had an instant impact as a starter and has scored a few times off the bench.  I've been trying to play the same way with both but just can't seem to figure it out with him.  Does he just not fit my play style and should be sold or are there tactical things I can change to get him more involved?
