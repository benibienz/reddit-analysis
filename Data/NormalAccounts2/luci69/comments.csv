Since you guys have been together so long, I'm sure he's very supportive? Just make sure he understands what you're dealing with and how he can help. Feeling ""numb"" is an awful side effect of depression and most meds for depression, but (for me anyway) the numbness was better than the lows. If you can't handle the numbness, talk to your doctor.
