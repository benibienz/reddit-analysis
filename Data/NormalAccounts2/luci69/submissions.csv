The hardest thing for me is when I don't understand something and I start getting frustrated and end up lashing out at my professors and classmates. This past week has been really bad for me as far as mood swings and now I think everyone in my classes probably think I'm a total nutcase. How do you deal with feeling like you've made a complete fool of yourself? I'm struggling hard lately and don't really know how to handle it,BPD,Dealing with college,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/57d8q0/dealing_with_college/

I guess it finally all got out of my system about a week and a half ago. 6 days ago he stopped talking to me. I kept trying to get him to listen and to look at articles I'd found about living with someone with BPD. He left the house anytime I asked him to talk. He told me I was ""pretty fucking crazy"". Yesterday, he texts me (after walking out on me trying to talk to him) to tell me he's done. He wants a divorce. I know I shouldn't be with someone so unsupportive, but I'm still heartbroken. I literally had no where I could go in town, so I spent 8 hours last night driving to my parents' house. My life got turned upside down in less than a week. I feel so alone and so broken.",BPD,BPD broke my marriage.,http://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/3e4i14/bpd_broke_my_marriage/

A lot of my behaviors started to make sense after my diagnosis. I have a lot of issues with controlling my emotions and overreacting to small things. I got married about 2 months ago and went off my medications because I thought I was stable. Turns out I'm not. My mental state has been causing a lot of tension in my marriage since I went off my meds. My husband doesn't fully understand what my mental state is like and we've been having a lot of arguments. Tonight, after a particularly bad fight, he went to the bar. That was 4 hours ago. I haven't tried calling or texting him because he has said part of our issues is because I am too ""clingy"". I wrote him a letter explaining that I'm going back on my meds starting tomorrow. Hopefully he sees it when he gets home. Has anybody else had serious relationship strain because of BPD and how do you deal with it? 

tl;dr: BPD causing relationship problems. How do you deal with and keep your marriage together?",BPD,New here. Needing help.,http://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/3dg7yz/new_here_needing_help/

Pay for August 1st (which from my understanding covers the 16th - the end of the previous month) falls on the 31st of July. Will I get a paycheck on the 31st of July covering the 16th - the 28th? I'm really freaking out about not being able to pay rent or bills... Thanks in advance for any answers!,AirForce,Pay question,http://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/comments/3d48uc/pay_question/

I've only just found this subreddit and thought I'd share my story. My mom has some mental health issues, but has only been diagnosed with clinical depression. I grew up being told things like ""I am the only important person in your life"" and ""I'm the only one you need to listen to"". I had ridiculous rules, which has caused me to have issues making friends to this day because I want allowed to have friends growing up. I am, still to this day, constantly told the things I need to do to look good, lose weight (I'm 5' 2"" and weigh 130 lbs. with a 29"" waist), and wear makeup at all times so my SO never sees me looking ""not pretty"". I had to wear makeup starting at 10 years old because I wasn't pretty enough. I live 500 miles away from her and she is still able to guilt me into doing things or saying things to make her happy, otherwise I ""must not love her"". My younger brother moved to another state to live with our bio dad (who we grew up hating due to the stories she told us) and she hasn't talked to him since because, obviously, it meant he hated her. My very shy husband doesn't talk to her much and she constantly asks if he doesn't like her. She still seems to have a hold on me and I can't get rid of it. I was told by my therapist I grew up being emotionally and mentally abused and I suffer from major depression from this. 
Sorry for the super long story, this is the first time I have shared all of this outside of therapy.",raisedbynarcissists,My mother,http://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3avqv7/my_mother/
