5,"Someone wrote a pretty interesting interpretation of what Papikas mean:

I feel like all of the Papikas were manifestations of possible relationships, and Cocona went through 1 by 1 turning them down because what she really wanted was what she already had with Papika. She didn't want a sexual relationship, didn't want to be swept away by a bad boy, or swooned by a prettyboy. She didn't want a friend who she could blow off steam with at the arcade, or gloomy friend she could do dorky stuff with, or an imouto who would make her meals and wash her back and want only for her love. She rejected each and all of it in turn because what she wanted was Papika.

All of the others looked like Papika but weren't. That was important. Despite looking like her physically, they were totally different personalities, and the authentic Papika personality is what she was searching for. Part of the point was that she wasn't looking for a superficial relationship. She didn't want someone that looked like Papika, and didn't want someone that just helped her meet one of her physical or emotional needs, like the boys being male company, or the slut being sexual gratification, or the imouto being a servile little teddybear. Her relationship to Papika goes beyond that, and the motions of this episode helped Cocona to realize that.",2016-11-17 22:36:02+00:00,da4up5w,2.0,t1_da4532w,33087.0,anime

76,"Brand is one of the easiest champions to counter.

First, you have the lane matchups that can make him ragequit. Fizz, Yasuo and Galio are a nightmare to play against for obvious reasons. Vel'Koz, Lux, Ziggs and Xerath outrange him hard. Annie, Diana and Anivia tend to win all-in 1v1 fights with him. A skilled LeBlanc, Zed, Ekko or Ahri can use their mobility to dodge the stun and win the lane, too. My pocket pick here is Quinn mid, as even if he carefully saves his Q to stop you, you will surely outtrade him at levels 1-2, the W speedup will help you dodge skillshots at level 4, and post-6 you can just roam.

On any AD champion Hexdrinker is the perfect item against him, as the shield bypasses the %hp damage from his passive. AP champions who can rush Abyssal Scepter should consider it.

In teamfights, all you need to do is to separate to break the ultimate and prevent the spread of Blaze explosions. Braum's shield and Yasuo's windwall are a godsend here, but anything like Janna's ult or Karma's empowered E works. Rushing Locket helps a lot, too, even on the jungler.

However the best way to deal with Brand is to burst him down before he gets to cast more than one spell. He's immobile and he can't even stun anyone with a single spellcast, so stuff like Vi's ultimate will absolutely ruin his day. Going ham to delete him before he casts anything will remove 50% of damage from the teamfight.

Considering how weak he is against a coordinated team, he's not ever a serious pick anywhere above Diamond, and that's why he's never been picked in LCS.",2016-10-12 14:00:28+00:00,d8orhd3,1.0,t3_573cce,14061.0,summonerschool
77,"Junglers in general are countered indirectly and by more than just the enemy jungler. For example if you pick Sejuani and the enemy team has the likes of Rumble, Elise, Brand, Vayne and Zyra, stacking health is a horrible horrible idea. Same goes for champions with blinks/mobility/immunity that can dodge or turn around your engage. This applies for all Cinderhulk junglers, though some like Zac will do just fine with Runic Echoes.

As far as jungle matchups are concerned, tank junglers are quite susceptible to counterjungling. Their early clear is slow and leaves them vulnerable, so someone like Shaco or Lee Sin can ruin your day. And in general champions with faster clear can simply show up top before you do.",2016-10-12 13:50:36+00:00,d8or2v9,2.0,t1_d8op43d,3210.0,summonerschool

**TL;DR:** This is probably the greatest upset in the history of League of Legends.

A Russian team ANX that came to the tournament through a wildcard tournament and never played against big teams from any of the 4 major regions before, just advanced to quarterfinals by beating the favorites ROX Tigers, who previously won the Korean league.

More context: Three years in a row, Koreans have been winning LoL World Championship. To say that the top Korean team is the favourite this year as well would be an understatement. Wildcard teams, on the contrary, have been always at the bottom of the table in the group stages, at most playing the spoiler by upsetting some of the mid-tier teams and ruining their chances of getting out of groups. This all changed today when a no-name team from Russia took down the tournament favorites, ascending to the top half of the group A.

The game was highly entertaining due to ANX's inexperience in closing out long, close games at the top level and ROX's perseverance and the ability to come out on top in infavourable fights.",2016-10-07 03:39:41+00:00,d8hg2xk,1.0,t3_569ftv,748.0,leagueoflegends

239,"&gt; Deconstruction is not an approach, or a method. If you take Heidegger, Sartre, Foucault, or Derrida seriously (though no one should have to) - the technical notion of deconstruction is supposed to be the exact opposite of ""method"". In a basic rendering: deconstruction amounts to ""finding hidden contradictions or other factors in a text/work-of-art that signify the opposite of the author's intentions, or method."" To deconstruct a text is to show that the text undermines itself, and that it has consequences or meanings that the author did not expect or WANT. As such it cannot be methodological, or pinned down, without paradox. Every text has to be viewed on its own terms. If anything, deconstruction tends toward ideological, rather than methodological, criticism.

246,"&gt; According to the chart, Grimgar would be a deconstruction.

Yup. What makes this particular one a deconstruction is how it relates to other known series. By itself it's just a sad, a bit grim story. However, the isekai premise instantly contrasts it with the usual anime.

Grimgar's deconstruction lies in detaching the ""trapped in a game world"" premise from the gamer protagonist. Modern isekai like SAO, LH, Overlord or KonoSuba often features a MC who understands the mechanics of the game. Grimgar has its cast forget everything about the old world, RPG cliches included. That's why they fall for the ""unprotected healer dies"" trap that new players so often make.",2016-09-13 16:24:57+00:00,d7l5kjq,2.0,t1_d7l3qu9,2256.0,anime
247,"&gt; I mean first of all, I don't buy the idea that you're saying it's not ""criticizing"" these tropes, precisely because when you say you deconstruct tropes to reveal their ""flaws,"" that is by definition what criticizing entails.

Okay, then let me say once more: Witcher doesn't criticize LotR. It criticizes the likes of Eragon and Sword of Truth.

I made a grave mistake by mentioning Gandalf. Yes, he's been the model for all wizard advisors, but he's written as a demigod, not a human. The flaw that Witcher exposes is that human wizards helping heroes and kings as advisors are bound to become political players themselves. Gandalf is written precisely with avoiding that in mind: he interferes as little as possible.

&gt; If we are talking purely about the act of Shinji getting in the robot and being a complete pansy as a sort of deconstructive idea, let us refer to the original Gundam movies. Amuro goes through this precise dilemma and struggles over the course of the entire first movie to even get into the robot. He suffers psychological trauma, gets slapped a couple times in the infamous bright slap, and all that he's missing is the extreme breakdown. One could easily argue that Gundam's rendition in the middle of a war is of a more ""realistic"" sort, and I would imagine young kids who were sent to fight in wars in the 20th century could serve as a reasonable example (especially Japanese fighters during the second world war) as instances where people did get in the metaphorical robot and fought for the sake of country.

That is why Gundam is also considered to be a deconstruction of the Super Robot cliches. I don't think you'd agree with everything written at TVTropes, but you should pay a visit to their articles about deconstruction.

I literally mention in the chart that Gundam launched the Real Robot genre. Playing mechas realistically isn't something revolutionary NGE did first.

&gt; we know how the chosen one became the chosen one in many of these stories. Frodo is the Chosen One because he's a hobbit, an enemy that Sauron would not expect, whose stalwart but innocent heart would resist the temptation of the Ring. Luke is the ""Chosen One"" to fulfill a sort of metaphorical father/son relationship that persists through the original Star Wars trilogy (not a fantasy example, but pertinent enough).

Frodo is hardly Chosen One in the most cliche meaning you could think of. Luke is a better example here - a designated hero who's defined as the only person who can save world. Good examples here are Luke, Harry Potter, Richard Rahl, Eragon. Most of them came out that way because, well a) genetics b) magic c) both.

Now what Witcher does is dig around Ciri's predicament. She's the Chosen One because of genetics, sure, but she's also bound by destiny to Geralt due to an old Law of Surprise. The deconstructive approach here is especially evident when the mage Vilgefortz states that pretty much all that's needed from Ciri for him to carry on the Chosen One business is her placenta blood, and he can work out the rest from there, since it's all about the genetic material. Ciri reflects on what technically makes her a ""chosen one"", rejects the magical power she has, flips a middle finger on the world that she doesn't seem worth saving - but the ""bound to Geralt"" bit she accepts and forces to happen, as he's the best father figure she's ever had.

Once again, I admit that The Witcher was a horrible example here, because we've just spent so much time arguing what it even deconstructs. Game of Thrones would have probably been a little less problematic example.",2016-09-13 16:19:26+00:00,d7l5aub,8.0,t1_d7l3r8j,1912.0,anime

251,"&gt; At least 2/3 of your infographics specifying the deconstructive elements of the Witcher are somehow related to LotR (because it's such a massive landmark title in all of fantasy). One of them specifically mentions Gandalf. I merely used it as the obvious counterexample.

Touche, but that 2/3 number is too much.

LotR and Narnia do obviously count as heroic fantasy, but they aren't what people would describe as ""stereotypical heroic fantasy"". As you've pointed out already, LotR is anything but stereotypically heroic.

&gt; I'm not sure what your point is here. Could you clarify?

My point is: You seem, from what I understand, to accuse me of referring to ""stereotypical heroic fantasy"" without giving examples. My argument is that these stereotypes don't need good examples, or even don't have them, because they're hardly ever played straight in popular fiction.

And yet The Witcher plays them out in a deconstructive manner. It doesn't try to criticize LotR, or Narnia, or Conan the Barbarian. It simply takes a simplistic premise you'd find in stuff like Eragon or Sword of Truth, and answers the question ""how could this possibly work in a realistic setting"".

Back earlier you've mentioned that most popular fiction is internally consistent. Yes, but that's after you make few core assumptions about the setting. Deconstruction questions those assumptions. If you lock princess in a tower, it asks *why would you do that* and gives a grim yet reasonable explanation. If you throw a Chosen One into the story, it studies *how did they become Chosen One* and what's so peculiar in the story that would actually make them so.

All things considered, The Witcher might have been an ill-advised example, since most people only know the game, and it lacks all the rich background the books had.",2016-09-13 15:27:07+00:00,d7l2rsn,6.0,t1_d7l1k7i,1572.0,anime

254,"&gt; Not really, because the chart has already fallen into the trap of trying to describe classic genre tropes described in the ""standard heroic story.""

I'm not saying The Witcher is a revolutionary title that exposes the flaws in the timeless classics such as Lord of the Rings. Moreover, I realy doubt anyone would name Narnia or LotR when listing ""heroic fantasy"".

&gt; What Witcher 3 really does is it has an interesting perspective from an angle we don't normally see, but I'm really doubting why I should buy this line of reasoning specified in the infographic, if your response to my question is to just throw out ""classic fairy tales"" (many of which by the way are gruesome and surprisingly ""realistic"") and expect me to take it at face value.

Witcher 3 is just the popular entry in the franchise most people are familiar about. I'm referring to the entire story, which is much more than that.

About ""standard heroic fantasy"" - most people haven't really read Conan the Barbarian or Sword of Truth, but they still have a vague idea of what heroic fantasy looks like. I think Eragon is pretty popular, though.

The fairy tales example is actually perfect here. I think you'll agree that one of the most famous stereotypes/tropes from fairy tales is a knight on a white horse defeating a dragon. Now take a while to find any story from Grimm or Perrault with that particular trope in it. It only comes back in Disney.

And same goes for heroic fantasy. Some stereotypes about what ""standard heroic fantasy"" is are just stereotypes with no particular famous title to name.

&gt; Which is anachronistic. First of all, everybody knows that magical girls are a Faustian bargain, even if they are unaware of the actual term. It's the oldest trope in the book. To say that Madoka ""deconstructs"" this by essentially showcasing us the original Faustian bargain is just asking to be called out for the argument's lack of historicity.

That is exactly how Madoka exposes flaws in the core cliches of Mahou Shoujo. It shows the bare bones of Faustian bargain, detached from its usual cutesy upbeat outline.

&gt; all I really see is a dark subversion'

Madoka isn't a dark subversion because it isn't a subversion at all in the first place. Subversion would set up audience's expectations, then come up with a different solution. What happens in Madoka is that the expected tropes still play out, just not in the way the audience expected them to.",2016-09-13 14:50:36+00:00,d7l13fx,4.0,t1_d7kzwey,1629.0,anime

&gt; Madoka deconstructs it's genre, but it also reconstructs everything it initially deconstructed towards the end.

We call it the Decon-Recon switch. I mention that under the Reconstruction part.

&gt; And it's characters aren't anything too special. 

That's assessing the show's quality and it's completely unrelated to its usage of deconstruction. Example: just because Grimgar is pretty meh doesn't mean it's not trying to deconstruct isekai tropes.

&gt; Shinsekai Yori is one that I'd truly call a deconstruction.

If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.

Terms to describe what people do come more often than not AFTER people start doing that more than once. The very word ""meme"" is younger than memes.

&gt; It assumes an archetypal ""standard heroic story"" without providing an example of one.

Spiral stairs don't need to have a supporting column for you to see an axis.

Fairy tales, heroic fantasy pulp fiction, stuff like Sword of Truth. Is that enough?

The Witcher doesn't address any particular heroic fantasy book. It simply carries out a heroic fantasy story while explaining in what type of world it could work out in a cliche way.

&gt; Most egregiously, Madoka as a deconstruction is such a terrible example, precisely because it is essentially a rendition of the Faustian legend.

It's indubitably a rendition of the Faustian legend. In fact, you could call it an observation how close Magical Girl genre could be to Faust.

It's still, as I've explained, a deconstruction of the magical girl genre. Every core trope of the setting is questioned - the source of powers, the role of the magical companion, and the purpose of battling evil.",2016-09-13 13:58:06+00:00,d7kyv0u,2.0,t1_d7ky9nn,914.0,anime

279,"I'll try to be as brief as possible while explaining the whole context.

#Background

In 2005, after left-wing post-communists were outed due to corruption investigations, two right wing parties, PO (centric, liberal) and PiS (conservative, socialist) were supposed to make a coalition government, but PO bailed out and PiS was left alone with a minority government coalitioned with far-right and farmer-rooted populists. The minority government fell apart in 2007, but in the meantime PiS won the presidential elections, and their president, Lech Kaczyński, remained in seat.

It's 2010. PO won the elections in 2007 and formed a stable government. Prime minister is Donald Tusk, speaker of the Parliment is Bronisław Komorowski. The PiS party is the main opposition force, led by Jarosław Kaczyński, the twin brother of the president.

#Foreign policy of Poland in 2010

Basically it's a weird system that turned out awkward at the time. We have a Ministry of Foreign Affairs, part of the government, but we also have a president. They are both responsible for our foreign policy, but the president is in a limbo between being a figurehead and actually driving it. It's sort of ""power he has but shouldn't abuse"", and you know how *that* goes in the politics.

President Lech Kaczyński had his own vision on the foreign affairs politics that wasn't necessarily what the government had in mind. There haven't been any big conflicts about it or disagreements on what are the country's goals, but he was keen on pushing forward with his own style. He was heavily criticized for it in the media and by the ruling party. It wasn't quite meteoritical, it was mostly mocking.

His most famous stunt was packing several presidents of European countries onto a plane to Tbilisi back in 2008 during the Russo-Georgian War, showing firm and immediate support of the Georgian state. This feat gained all Poles immense popularity in Georgia. Till this day a Pole coming to Georgia is likely to get free drinks. Our media alternate between criticizing this as risky and reckless and mocking him for wanting to be close to danger.

Looking back, his foreign policy was kinda respectable and gained Poland a lot of respect in the region.

#The anniversary of Katyń massacre

On April 7th, Prime Minister Donald Tusk comes with an official government delegation to commemorate the 70th anniversary of arguably the most heinous crime of Russia against Poland - the mass execution of 22 000 members of Polish intelligentsia and high-ranking officers. The visit is a ""no big deal"" type of event, reported in media as, well, something that's happened.

What's important here is that Donald Tusk was officially invited by Vladimir Putin, who was back then the Prime Minister of Russia. Both politicians being the real governor of the country, it was a meeting of properly matched state heads. However, from the Polish side of things, it was not neccessarily the main event.

So the President, conducting his own foreign policy, prepared a visit to Katyń three days later, on April 10th. He planned to bring a handful of important people with him - historical figures, families of people murdered in the Katyń forest back in 1940, parliment members, and high-ranking generals.

The idea itself was not all that bad. The Polish delegation would be disproportionate to the Russian one if they all met together. A firm, courteous handshake one day, a personal gathering of commemoration and mourning the other day.

However, being under heavy pressure from the media about budget and overplaying this whole president thing, Lech Kaczyński made an idiotic decision of putting all these important people onto one plane. And a series of people allowed him to do it.

#The catastrophe

Actually, there isn't much to be said there. The plane attempted to land onto a foggy airfield with outdated technology. On the third attempt, it hit a tree and crashed.

#The aftermath

And here's where things go to shit:

* Some people blame Lech Kaczyński on pressuring the pilots to land in these conditions
* Some people despite all the evidence believe that it was a Russian assassination

Meanwhile Russians refuse to hand over the wreckage, cut it in parts, and laugh their assess off watching the political shitstorm in Poland that lasts until this day.",2016-09-12 14:44:03+00:00,d7jl2f0,1.0,t3_52eg1l,2726.0,poland

285,"Last Completed: **Zetsuen no Tempest**

I'll copy my post from ""What have you watched past week that's not an airing show"" thread:


I knew this one would be right up my alley from the moment someone spoiled me and mentioned it has [Zetsuen no Tempest](/s ""time-travel""). I'm a sucker for that, it's always a surefire tool for writing tragedy. The method for it was quite original and undeniably badass, too.

First, the characters. They're unbelievably sexy, like Monogatari-tier sexy. And I don't just mean the girls. Studio BONES knows how to one-up a good manga with a great adaptaton. This show made me finally learn the name of Miyuki Sawashiro and her coughing voice I've loved in pretty much everything else she starred in. And that would be, as was in the case of Kana Hanazawa, pretty much every anime ever.

Second, the setting. Modern/urban fantasy is a coinflip for me, sometimes it's right up my alley (Railgun, DtB, Durarara), sometimes it's not (Index, Fate, Noragami). This one was nothing to write home about, but it never hurt the overall quality. Magic bound by strict rules is always a joy to see.

Third, the plot. And this one has two layers to it. One is the story, a blatantly self-proclaimed Shakespearean tragedy. Another is how the characters move and change through it. Both are... difficult to describe. It felt like I was sitting across the room with the writer, each of us slowly sipping their beer, and comparing notes. Many times throughout the show I was positively surprised with how much cheap drama that any other story would resort to was carefully avoided. I really appreciate that.

Overall a pretty solid title. I think it's a pretty firm 8/10 for me.

296,"&gt;As a deconstruction, it fails to subvert any ""genre"" stereotypes.

As I've said already, it's not a genre deconstruction, but a single trope deconstruction.

&gt;As a drama, it is poorly written. There is very little variety in dramatic techniques used particularly in the later episodes.

It doesn't play for full on drama all the time, and yeah, last few episodes have been mostly action, but episodes 13 and 18 are as good drama as you can get. I'm not even touching on episode 15.

&gt;As a mystery, it doesn't ask enough questions and doesn't give enough answers.

Yeah, besides the whole mansion arc which turned our Edge of Tomorrow into a murder mystery.

&gt;As an adventure, there is little to no exploration and the world building is mostly unrelated exposition rather than seeping through every detail of the story.

It is arguably an adventure, we're just looping through the stages. I think Dark Souls comparison would be in place.

&gt;As a thriller, there is very little threat and no attempt to maintain tension.

Yeah besides the fact that the main character, having no plot armor whatsoever, can and will die if he screws up.

&gt;As a romance, it feels very forced and cliché. Nothing unique or interesting about the relationships.

The romance isn't played straight. MC's one-sided crush gets derailed and ran into the ground - he gets too whiteknighty and possessive, and therefore rejection is the natural reaction. As for Rem, I wouldn't even call her a romantic interest, she's aplot device, a weaponized waifubait. By weaponized I mean it's a bait for the audience, not the MC.

&gt;As a comedy, it's barely funny.

With how much of a sadist the author is I doubt it was ever meant to be a comedy.

&gt;What even does Re:Zero do well? Really, it doesn't hold a candle to the other anime greats

It personifies the disdain towards copy-paste LN protagonists, and turns the MC's self-aware expectations of his adventure against him. It's neither NGE nor Madoka, and it's not Steins;Gate, but it's still miles above everything else from the isekai stories.

304,"&gt; I wish they would make more.

They will, but they will never make a second Road to the Cup again.

In big companies, the rule of thumb is ""new is always better"". Progress is king, and you could boil it down to ""you can't lose a comparison you're not in"". This is why Worlds haven't gone back to a huge stadium like in Korea in 2014. Every edition has to be fresh, new, different. New faces, new setting, new format, everything new. Even the season numbers are gone because Riot doesn't want new players to get scared of coming into a seven year old game, so it's ""season 2016"" instead of ""season 6"".

Riot will experiment with videos from time to time. Sometimes they'll pump money into skin line reveal (PROJECT), sometimes champion reveal (Bard, animated by studio Mir, same as in Road to the Cup), sometimes something new they'll come up with (as it was with Warriors). But they will never match up precisely with something they've released before.

It was a shock and after letters from angry parents it was moved to a different timeslot, with its budget cut (which resulted in iconic prolonged scenes and a bizarre finale, later ""fixed"" by a movie End of Evangelion).

It's as if you took a good yet surprisingly brutal and serious anime like Cowboy Bebop or Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and aired it on Cartoon Network instead of Toonami. The shitstorm alone would make people interested in the whole deal.

313,"Anime isn't a money maker by itself, few exceptional cases aside. Most series air late-night, when the advertisements are barely worth anything. However, it's a **marketing tool used to promote other goods** - games, light novels, manga, and, last but not least, merchandise such as figurines.

In case this idea seems weird to you, think of Pokemon and YuGiOh.

**The goal is to make a bank on the obsessive (otaku) audience**, who will buy *everything* from their favourite series. That's why those figurines are at absurdly high prices - they're a status symbol showing dedication to specific series or characters. By creating a popular brand with a high-investment project (anime), you monetize stuff that's way cheaper to produce (print, discs, merch). This is no different from Disney, who, if it was illegal to interrupt children's TV programming with ads, would still operate their own TV channels at a loss without care, because it's the toys that make them the most money.

**Some series make money on Blu-Rays alone**. We call the going-even threshold ""the Manabi line"" - the point at which anime made enough money on blu-rays to cover its costs and wasn't a disaster for the studio (FYI, the animators are really poorly paid). That line is something around 3-4 thousand copies, and only half of the currently airing anime (about 20 new titles per quarter) reach that. Anime that went below that line is a financial loss and will not get a second season. The term is VERY obscure and imprecise, since different anime series have different production costs, but it's being used on /a/ anyway. And most of the time it gives you a good idea on how stuff sells. Best series of a given season sell 10-20 thousand blu-rays (entries in long-standing franchises can sell way more than that). This number was enough to give KonoSuba and Overlord a second season and carry the entire Yuuki Yuuna multimedia project that continues after the anime (though most of it is rather low-investment stuff like manga and novels).

This approach explains few odd things about anime, such as **TV series without a conclusive end that do not adapt the source material in its entirety**. Sometimes that's because there isn't enough for a whole new season, but sometimes the anime was merely an advertisement and the viewer is meant to buy the LN/manga instead of waiting for the second season. And sometimes, especially when the source material is finished and there's nothing to advertise anymore, the anime cuts off because it wasn't profitable enough on its own.

In practise, it means **waiting long years for second seasons of smash hits such as Attack on Titan or One Punch Man**, because the studios want to nail the timing to sell as much stuff it promotes as it can. The schedules of new anime seasons have to line up with releases of new manga/LN volumes etc. In most extreme cases the anime is halted if it's perceived as overshadowing the source material (as it is with the Raildex franchise, where the spin-off *Railgun* was more successful than the parent story *Index*). As said in the paragraph above, the audience is meant to buy the novels instead of being content with the anime.

There is a good side to it, though. Sometimes a show meant to be another shitty advertisement turns out MUCH better than expected. WIXOSS, based on a card game, is... okay, and Rage of Bahamut: Genesis is an entertaining adventure flick that can be described as ""Pirates of Caribbean meets Diablo meets Road to El Dorado""... based loosely on a mobile card game. Its unexpected success lead the game publisher studio Cygames to invest into even more anime like that.

The multiple layers of monetizing have allowed for a new trend as well - authors of web comics and web novels are being approached by production companies and paid fairly for their work, since their content, already released for free, isn't the last stage. **Some of the most popular anime of the last year, One Punch Man, Re:Zero and Mob Psycho 100, have all been released for free as web comics/web novels - but their authors made money on official releases**.

Oh and Japan doesn't give a shit about popularity in the West. Back in the 80s and 90s people had to pirate everything anyway, and the revenue from licensing and streaming in places like Crunchyroll or Funimation right now isn't all that much. This might change a little bit if Netflix continues pouring money into new projects - sometimes it's just buying exclusive streaming rights, but they're starting to fund their true Netflix Originals. Anyway, until then there are many series that are blockbuster hits in Japan but low-key among the Western fans, like many idol anime, and series popular in the West that sold poorly in Japan (or: not spectacularly enough to warrant another season). Good examples are Spice and Wolf, The Devil is a Part-Timer, Claymore - but the crowning jewel here is Shinsekai yori, critically acclaimed anime, renowned among Western fans as one of the best series ever made, fully adapted based on an award-winning Japanese novel - and it sold below 200 blu-ray units. That's below bad, that's just laughable.

There's also some idol shows that make *insane* money on CDs and event tickets. Usually that goes in pair with high BD sales, but not necessarily - Symphogear, in particular, started out with mediocre quality and low sales, but became a profitable operation with the sky high sales of its music. That prompted the studio to invest more money into animation quality, and with the brand growing strong, the BD sales went up in the following seasons, too.

Movies, however, operate in a different realm. They get to make their money from ticket sales *and* blu-rays, and are released to the mainstream audience, the people who wouldn't buy blu-rays or figurines. So yeah, they do make money. They're even considered a way for multi-media franchises to expand - many anime series have released a movie, some as the sequel to the story (Madoka Magica: Rebellion, Tamako Love Story), some as re-telling/recap, and some as a spin-off.

So anime does make money. Just not for the animators.

This is a flawed mindset. Just because something uses deconstruction of a single trope doesn't mean you're calling it ""a deconstruction"" as if this was some sort of holy grail genre. This isn't NGE, this isn't Madoka.

EDIT: While we're talking about [deconstruction - I've made another infographic about it](http://imgur.com/AHX8lyN) that might clear the issue for you. TL;DR deconstruction in pop culture is something loosely defined and there's a difference between genre deconstruction and trope deconstruction, and even the way Madoka and NGE deconstruct their genres is day and night different (NGE tells a psychological story, Madoka does a 180 and reconstructs the genre in its finale).",2016-08-24 16:46:07+00:00,d6uupw2,3.0,t1_d6uuebm,397.0,anime

380,"&gt; if

When*

This is a problem with all the ensemble cast series. There's the main group that we follow, and anyone outside of it is expendable. It's the only way to preserve the grittiness of the setting without sacrificing group dynamics, especially if the group is carefully crafted to last through an unforseen timespan (because this is Japan and the longer the serialization lasts, the better).

Alderamin has some outstandingly positive qualities (most underwatched show of the season IMO), but there are still some cliches it falls into. I would have bet on Kanna biting the dust in the last episode already, now they're just writing her tombstone.

It's not even that much of an accusation, Alderamin *cannot* kill anyone in its main cast yet due to some fundamental assumptions it runs on. They could kill the M guy, but that's a card they only get to play once, and without developing him over a longer timespan it's a cheap shot anyway.

And that's alright, I think. Cast changes aren't a good idea by itself, in my opinion Grimgar and Zestiria don't handle the matter as well as they should have - Grimgar drags the issue a tiny bit too long and the adaptation only handled one arc pair making it seem like a one-time deal, and the Zestiria game managed to raise a huge outrage with its bait-and-switch heroine marketing (one of the main reasons why people look forward to anime being different from the game). So maybe getting stuck to our generic fellowship can work for this show. I don't think anything in this show stands out too much from the 7-8/10 level other than the MC being a based literal motherfucker beyond the scale.",2016-08-19 20:01:50+00:00,d6ohac3,3.0,t1_d6ocdm6,6550.0,anime

414,"I was out in the middle of nowhere so I did some catching up.

**Bakemonogatari**

Picking up where I left it half a year ago, I've finished everything beyond the first five episodes and stopped somewhere in the middle of Nisemonogatari (right after the toothbrush scene).

I've loved Katanagatari, so Nisiosin's ""overtalked"" style isn't something off-putting to me, but this one... not so much. I've certainly appreciated the visuals, the dialogue and the exquisite erotica, but something is off about this show when you look at the sum of these ingredients. One minute you're watching the touching story of Senjougahara and enjoying her deadpan antics, another minute you're right in the middle of the sleazy fanservice top bath scene of 2014. I don't buy it. I don't really ""get"" the juxtaposition of deep, intricate character development and the ""whatever"" general structure of the caleidoscope story. Koyomi balances on the edge between having a decisive character of his own and being just a plot device for the audience to self-insert into. Somehow I just can't suspend my disbelief while watching the plot gravitate towards this guy on a 24/7 basis. This is Kamijou Touma levels of harem gravity and that irks me.

Still, 8/10 because anything less would be a misunderstanding. Just because I don't like something doesn't mean I can't recognize it's really really good.

**The Tatami Galaxy**

Holy shit that was good. I don't always get into shows that smart (I'm a simple guy with simple needs), but had that one recommended by my sister, who's not *that* much into anime, so it had to be good. And boy it was. I guess part of the charm is me relating to the main character, but perhaps college and post-college crowd was the intended demographic anyway. I was in love right from the first time I've heard the OP, it was somehow highly nostalgic and the visuals in it only solidified my feelings.

I don't think I can even say a lot about the show without addressing specific plot points. The characters were just vibrant and relatable, and I loved them all. These are the kind of people you hang out with. To some of them, you're just Higuchi. To some of them, you're Jogasaki. And to some of them, you might even be their own personal Ozu. But there might be an Akashi out there - perhaps you've already met her? So get the fuck out of your room and meet them.

I still haven't decided if it's a 9 or a 10, so I'll just give it a 10 and knock it down if I feel that my 10s list is too crowded.

**ReLIFE**

This show is going to fly under many people's radar just because it never got its fair share of weekly buzz and memes. And it's a superb comedy and a reaction face goldmine. ReWATCH when.

I did not like the volleyball arc but I guess it gave teenager drama justice. This is how it goes at that age.

I'm also not a fan on how they excused both test subjects from becoming a NEET. None of them ""got there"" on their own, they are portrayed as victims of circumstances beyond their control. I didn't expect ""Welcome to the NHK"" depth, but some diversity towards cold hard realism would be appreciated.

The fuck. Anyways, I've got just the idea for you that might help, or, at least, it helped me:

Start doing stuff for people. Could be soup kitchen, homeless shelter, animal shelter, teaching, anything. I volunteered at a local school (that I actually went to decade ago) and started a programming club. A year later, the parent council took me to the side and asked if I they could pay me to stay. Now I'm getting paid as much by the hour as the highest, 4th tier teacher. It's not many hours, but I feel really appreciated. And what's even more important, I started finding my place in the world. I've seen the kids look up to me, and realized I can get myself better to live up to their expectations. I'm still in therapy, my career is a mess, there's a lot to be improved - but I've found the direction, looked up, started walking towards it.

Furthermore, it's his *lack* of empathy that causes him to misjudge the woman in the first episode. That whole point is never addressed again, which I found silly. It would make much more sense if Chiyuki taught him to judge better and the show made an effort to present the progress and the effect. A happy ending like Chiyuki becoming an arbiter would have been too much, but still, the story was severely lacking here."")

I wasn't a fan of the premise either, which turns the whole Buddhist eschatology on its head - in Buddhism, reincarnation is the ""bad"" end that causes you to try again from scratch, while becoming one with the ""void"", nirvana, is the ultimate goal of every soul and the ""good"" end. Looking at it logically, every soul in Death Parade is bound to sooner or later get the ""void"" judgement, so that would mean all of humanity is eternally doomed. If that's the concept, then the show did not commit to reflecting on how pessimistic that vision is.

Well, there are several nice places you can go to. I'd advise towards the southern area - Kraków, Wieliczka, Auschwitz, Zakopane. They're relatively close to each other and each of these locations offers unique and memorable experience.

Kraków - one day, maybe two. Just go see the Market Square and Wawel Castle and you're set. You can also visit one of the NUMEROUS museums.

Wieliczka Salt Mines - half a day. Must see. You go down a few hundred metres and walk through the famous tourist route.

Auschwitz (Oświęcim) - self-explanatory. Won't take much time to see, but you definitely won't be feeling like doing anything else that day.

Zakopane - if you want to escape the heat and see the mountains (a *little* bit higher than the ones you got in Lebanon), this is two, three or more days. Perfect for one-day trips up and down.

No, Jon was about to desert NW and rush to Winterfell when he got a letter from Ramsay.

Since Jon's death was pretty much undeserved in the show, his moment of weakness gets moved to the battle - he sees Rickon, he goes blind with anger, he makes a mistake. Doing stupid things for the family runs in the Stark house - Ned and Robb did the same thing.

475,"The motivations and the mindset of the character got utterly ruined by the TV adaptation. Almost everything the readers liked him for was turned into a morbid caricature.

Stannis is not a strictly likeable character, he's not supposed to be one. Losing all popularity contests, metaphorically, is why half of his own bannermen betrayed him and joined his younger brother to begin with. But there's something oddly enticing about the guy - he knows his situation, he sees he's not popular, he understands that people won't follow him for the jest of it - and he finds a way to push through against the odds.

I think many people jumped on the bandwagon simply because he's the direct successor of Ned Stark's legacy from season one (main character), even more so than Ned's own son, Robb. Robb Stark's campaign is more about vengeance and repaying the Lannisters tit for tat by declaring North's independence. Stannis's agenda, on the other hand, is justice - he seeks to right the wrongs that have been made, and basically finish what Ned started, just this time without naive moments of weakness such as Ned's trust of Littlefinger or his warning to Cersei. Stannis is more or less Ned Stark 2.0. He even worked on uncovering the Lannister conspiracy with Jon Arryn, Ned's mentor, whose death brought Ned to the capital in the first place and made Stannis flee in the fear for his life. Oh and, small fact, Ned's wish was for Stannis to succeed the throne, but I guess the show didn't pay much attention to that fact.

A Song of Ice and Fire has a variety of approaches to the titular ""game of thrones"". Stannis enters the stage when the War of the Five Kings breaks out. There's Joffrey Baratheon, the evil demon bastard spawn that's a pretty cliche bad guy, Renly Baratheon, who gathers a numerous force to take the throne as the commonly liked candidate, Robb Stark, who vows to break the North from the realm, Balon Greyjoy, having his vikings rebel once again, and finally Stannis, the rightful heir to the throne after his older brother's death. While most of the other pretenders have some personal reasons for joining the clash, Stannis, surprisingly enough, seems pretty indifferent: he repeats on and on how pissed he is with the whole situation and that he never asked for it. He's driven by duty and pursues the throne not because he wants it, but because he has to fullfill his place in history. In terms of Dungeons and Dragons allegiance he is the very embodiment and textbook definition of Lawful Neutral.

This creates a pretty unique character, that despite being so high in the feudal food chain is ""just doing their job"" without any ambition or drama so common in that social group. He's not your usual ""good guy"", but he's devoid of some flaws the typical good guys have, such as putting personal feelings before duty (which dooms the ""good guy"" Robb Stark). He shoots dry witty one-liners left and right, mocking his rivals and his fate alike.

Now, some part of that character got adapted in an acceptable way. Some. Here's where it gets bad:

* Book Stannis is an atheist who lost his faith years ago when his parents died. Show Stannis is a religious fanatic burning people at stake for heresy. That goes against book quote ""I will have no burnings. Pray harder"".
* Book Stannis is the best military commander in the world, beating enemies with clever planning and experience. He even beats the GoT equivalent of vikings *on sea*. In the books, he's about to prepare a grandiose trap to surprise the coming enemy at a frozen lake. In the show, he has his whole logistics ruined by a tiny raiding party and that dooms his whole thousand-man army.
* Book Stannis leaves his wife and daughter with a sizeable force at the Wall, and goes on with a campaign to win the trust of the Northern lords. Show Stannis burns his own daughter, dies to a Kingsguard of his brother who calls Renly ""the RIGHTFUL heir"", rubbing salt in the readers' wounds, and the campaign in the North with all its glory gets ceded to other characters, fan favorites (Jon Snow and Sansa Stark).
* Almost all of the lines painting Stannis in a good light are gone, and the show keeps bringing him up in conversations as an example of a bad guy, even though his agenda was pretty much the same as the ""good guys"": bringing down Lannisters and Boltons (the absolute bad guys).

He's being used as a ""bad guy"" sample by a girl who was being held captive by these bad guys, bethrothed to a psychopath bastard, in a city he sieged with plans to liberate it - TWICE. That exact scenario, down to engagement/marriage, played out twice. And Stannis is explicitly described as the one commander who forbids his army to rape or loot, so he was as close to truly ""liberating"" these castles as it can possibly get in that world.

Stannis is not the only victim of the show adaptation (other ones being Loras Tyrell, Dorne and from the looks of it Euron Greyjoy), but he's the most extreme and evident example, so he's become some sort of a poster boy for readers to complain about. This is just the most obscene example of polarizing characters into obvious ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" - book characters are more complex and interesting than that. Fan favourites aren't all that clean in the books, with Tyrion Lannister having people murdered just because they spied on his mistress and Arya having more dubious morals than just ""vengeance"". Stannis was a very rare example of middle ground between ""good"" and ""bad"" - righteous enough to root for, ruthless enough to succeed. With the adaptation for the mainstream audience, some simplifications had to be done, but book readers are hurt because that much of the flavour is gone. Writing out interesting characters is one thing, but having a character ruined and all the good bits given to fan favourites just feels wrong.

That processor is an APU. This is a rare case where the integrated graphics card is really strong considering the price of the chip.

That one problem out of three is a non-issue if you release Solo Queue right now. SoloQ would just have to deal with role weight (read: support avoiding) and queue times. Which are again a mess you made by yourselves with the new Champion Select.

This is anime protagonist levels of bad writing. Notice how Rey never met anyone who could do what she does better. Flying the Falcon? She was *lecturing Han Solo* on it. Speaking to droids/Chewbacca? No translator neded. Using the Force and fighting with a lightsaber? Give her two minutes of warmup and she will overpower a guy who spent his entire life edgelording into his emo Sith form.

Sure, he still has some things to finish, but it's mostly stuff like with Luke visiting Yoda in ROTJ. He's been training for YEARS with Luke and later Snoke.

None of these things would have been bad on its own, it's the combination that makes Rey an poorly written character.

100+ anime later, turns out, nope. Nothing has ever come close to FMAB. It's unmatched... in its own category.

But there are many shows that are just as good. Arguably even better. Just belonging to different genres. You will never find something better exactly like it - action-adventure with steampunk-esque fantasy setting, geared towards young audience, but with suprisingly mature themes.

However, you will find shows that are great thrillers (maybe just not crime drams with supernatural element like Death Note), great comedies, and great action pieces. And some of those wil carry higher production values than FMAB.

/u/MaximalDisguised has already linked you my flowchart. If you want some easier to digest type of map, try [this](http://i.imgur.com/0MipXEQ.jpg) recommendation chart.

Also, one of the four series you've mentioned is not like the other. I won't find you a strictly more engaging thriller than Death Note, though Monster is arguably better. I won't find you better shounen, though HxH is arguably just as good as FMAB. I won't find you a second mecha show like Code Geass, as it mixes a pretty unique set of themes (100 anime later, you will maybe come tor ealization that Geass is full of asspulls and not that perfect after all).

But as for Sword Art Online, you can easily get cured out of thinking it was good. Try Log Horizon (especially), No Game No Life, KonoSuba, Grimgar, and the currently airing Re:Zero to see different approaches to the ""trapped in a game world"" genre that might shed some light on SAO's shortcomings. Frankly, hating on SAO is beating a dead horse at this point.

* Angel Beats
* High School of the Dead
* Nisekoi
* Attack on Titan
* Mirai Nikki
* Elfen Lied

* Steins;Gate
* Toradora
* Psycho-Pass
* Cowboy Bebop
* Eureka Seven
* Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun
* Daily Lives of High School Boys
* The Devil is a Part-Timer
* Hanasaku Iroha

850,"Ask yourself a question: why did Avatar suck? There are three reasons for that: first, its production quality was overall horrible, second, the script got butchered and stripped of all lore and depth the series had (perhaps because of the director's anti-Chinese racism), and third, it was based on already weakest of all three seasons. They've tried to go with a serious high fantasy movie while in season 1 it was still mostly a goofy children's cartoon.

So you simply don't repeat these fuckups. First, you make a good movie on its own. Second, you don't throw away what made the original story compelling. Third, you make sure that what you're approaching can be even translated to the big screen.

For example, FMAB would require at least three movies. The first could wrap up nicely after episode 19. The second one would drop the backstory and move to Briggs, while the third one would be pretty much all the Promised Day. So unless you've already successfully adapted other works, you do NOTtry this one. FMAB would require a monstrous budget.

Same goes for NGE. You can't just film live-action NGE and expect it to do well in the West. The Rebuilds exist and they're already inferior to the original series. Also, the issue of Westernization - Rei stays Japanese, but Shinji would have to change his name and or become Japanese-American, white American, Latinoamerican or African-American. Otherwise the Western audience will have trouble identifying with him.

It's not unheard of to have a video game with Slavic background, but most ""Slavic"" stuff is something heavily Russian, cut away from any connection to the Western viewer. Polish culture (along with Czech and Slovakian) is unique within the Slavic family - it connects the mythology with the Catholic, Western Europe. Unlike the Orthodox Eastern Slavs, Poles use the Latin alphabet and the Polish state was founded as a Catholic country. Kings, knights, peasants - it all worked as it did in the West, just with an added melting pot of cultural tolerance (Jews, Protestants, Tartars, Cossacks).

Poland is a comfortable gateway into the Slavic world for the Western audience for that reason. You start with a recognizable, medieval society - but as you wander into villages, away from the cities, you see the folklore's true heart.",2016-03-17 14:52:55+00:00,d13acp4,6.0,t1_d1399dj,1715.0,Games

* already liked, niche franchise going open world succesfully
* for people new to it, a window into completely fresh and unknown, yet relatable mythology, as it puts the Slavic folklore together with usual medieval fantasy, which is what was Poland's thing throughout the history
* blowing out of the water DA:I and FO4 - and dethroning Skyrim (though there won't ever be as many mods)
* despite downgrade from first trailers, still one of the best looking games of this gen, scaling on high-end PCs really well (just turn off nVidia's silly Hairworks) up to 4K and beyond
* setting the new benchmark for open-world storytelling (side quests better than main quest in most games)
* studio going heavy PR into pro-gamer attitude, making TW3 ""the game we wish all other games were more like""

Bloodborne was great and a valid GOTY contender (better combat system than TW3), but it wasn't really anything new. Rocket League is a continuous game like WoW, CS and LoL - you either play it all the time or you don't at all, this type of games rarely gets called GOTY.

You'll still miss out on some content, but most of faction-specific content is the joining proccess. Be careful in G2, though, as the monastery is a one-way entry. So ignore it or save it for last.

Vanilla G2 is easy. G2 with the addon is ultra hard, save for a stupidly OP weapon the addon introduces. I'd recommend playing vanilla G2 as a paladin, then playing Night of the Raven as a mage - and convert the sword into runes. Or just be a good guy and don't use that stupid sword.

G3 requires Community Patch to be called playable. Turn on every ""Alternative balance""/""Alternative AI"" option they provide. It basically fixes the game. It's a marvel, one of the best community patches in the history of gaming.

So first, you want something that will get through the customs. Just on that merit alone sabre might be a bad idea. However, that aside, it would actually be a pretty neat gift.

* dolls dressed up in Polish regional costumes (best if it's from her mother's region) - regular doll type, or plush, or china

888,"Hell no. Unfortunately.

I assume the parents are going to provide the candle and the white dress, which are traditional accessories for the baptism. You'll be holding the candle and stuff. If you're Catholic, you know the drill. On a very basic level, you're the witness of the event (a common Catholic rule that a ceremony happens if there's a witnesses or two - same works for marriage ceremonies and Confirmation, though Confirmation doesn't assume more than one witness).

Generally the first priority is supporting the family with toys and baby clothes if they need them. Usually it is done by consulting the parents and picking something from their list. But leave that to their family, unless they have none. If you're coming from abroad, bring something from your own country. It will be much appreciated. You can get something stupidly impractical - such as that sabre (so: a sombrero, a British tea cup, a Russian ushanka) that will wait for the child to grow up. Doesn't have to be expensive, just memorable.

Your main task as the godfather is to show up for the child's big events such as the First Communion (that's in 8 years). You should probably send a card at least for their birthdays. When your godparents lives close by, it's not unheard of to have them show up to birthday parties before grandparents. That's why people with close ties are picked - siblings or family friends.

Basically you're supposed to be the cool uncle that brings odd stuff the parents wouldn't give. Sometimes that means giving big presents (bicycle, tablet), sometimes it means giving small, but thought-out presents (box of sweets, some silly shit the parents wouldn't deem appropriate). Depends on what you can afford. Try to be a balance to the parents' style. You're some sort of a ""occasionally consulting parent"".

Some other use of godparents is to be the religious support. Picking the pious guy to be a more solid guide than the parents, if the parents themselves don't believe that much. In that case the godfather's role is to provide with the Catholic stuff - an illustrated Bible, then a normal Bible later on.",2016-03-10 09:40:14+00:00,d0ujfut,1.0,t3_49sqn2,1918.0,poland

Because I've misunderstood you, just like you've misunderstood me. I've though that your statement 10 years ago was that ""every ecchi will be a comedy"". Then, a sentence later, I realize that you've actually meant ""every comedy will be an ecchi"". That's why I say ""I call that back"" you weren't right you are not right, you are misunderstanding words I've put in a very unfortunate and confusing way.

&gt; You could have said madoka is a mecha and you will still be upvoted.

You're ovestimating my popularity here. I don't have any fancy flair or anything, and only the few /r/anime regulars who are recoginzable on their own recognize me.

&gt; Im not even going to try to argue this.

This seems patronizing. I'm going to reinforce my point. LGBT as a category makes most sense in the drama section because it's the dramas that are most likely to give it justice. In the realm of romance comedies LGBT characters are mostly caricatures, and any yuri/yaoi elements will be mostly pandering to straight male/female audience.

&gt; First you say it's not a genre, now that it has its own hub in the action section.

It's not a genre proper but you can call it a genre in the same way you can call mahou shoujo a genre.

As in the flowchart recognizes few main genres, such as Action, Adventure, Comedy, Slice of Life, Drama, Thriller, Horror. The core idea of the flowchart is using a series of simple questions to differentiate between those. In the light of these criteria, things like fantasy and science fiction are rather settings than genres.

Genre is a term that's difficult to define.

935,"&gt; I don't know if im reading this correctly...you are saying comedy is mostly a... subsection of ecchi?! 

The other way around. I made a shortuct you might rightly not have followed: romance in the flowchart is divided between romcom and romance drama (two separate subcategories). and like 99% ecchi shows are comedies. So I'd argue Ecchi is a subsection of Comedy right now.

&gt; 10 years ago i argued in a forum that fans in the future will be so accustomed to ecchi shows they will think comedy its part of it.

Call them and tell them you were right.

&gt; there is a big amount of comedy shows that don't rely on ecchi at all.

Okay, I call that back. Ecchi often goes in pair with comedy, but nobody says comedy has to have ecchi.

Big misunderstanding. Let me rephrase my own sentence:

Making LGBT a subcategory could work, but only in the drama section. In comedy it's **[LGBT, yuri, yaoi is]** more often than not just a subsection of ecchi.

The expanded universe makes the Railgun anime look like cheap stupid anime original plot that doesn't belong in the main continuity. However, for people who aren't going to read the LNs, Index is an unfinished underwhelming story that cuts off before it gets to adapt the best part (WWIII), while Railgun, however stupid with its filler arcs, is somewhat a contained story that can be enjoyed on its own.

**Fall 2015**

* One Punch Man - nuff said.
* Osomatsu-san - just watch the first episode, you can drop it afterwards just like I did. But it was so hilarious it got banned from Japan.
* Sakurako-san - you know the American TV show ""Bones""? This is kinda similar.
* Also Gundam IBO and Haikyuu's second season started. Overall pretty meh season.

Watch OPM and 1st ep of Osomatsu.

**Summer 2015**

* Stay away from Charlotte and Gangsta. They only became progressively worse as the season went on. Rage-inducing wasted potential.
* Himuoto! Umaru-chan was a decent comedy. Not my thing, but some people had a blast with it.
* Akagami no Shirayuki-hime is an example of a good shoujo romance in medieval fantasy setting (without action). Still airing right now.
* Gate... If you want some Rome Sweet Rome it delivers, but you will eventually realize it's a pretty blatant ad for the Japanese miltary. It's stupidly jingoist.
* Jokumachi no Dandelion was underwatched underrated slice-of-life comedy show about a large set of siblings (9). It made for some really nice moments, and ""positively surprised"" is the general reaction of most people.
* Overlord was an okay-ish entry into the MMO genre. Badass OP. Got kinda boring for me but some people enjoyed it throughly. It's Madhouse, so season 2 never.
* A shipload of extremely lewd ecchi comedies: MonMusu, Shimoneta and Prison School. All have their ups and downs. Prison School actually has a larger female fanbase than male, at least in Japan. Bromance sells as much as femdom, apparently.
* Notable sequels: Symphogear GX, Working 3, Non Non Biyori Repeat. All kinda must-watch (but in order).

Watch: Symphogear, Symphogear G, Symphogear GX, Non Non Biyori, Non Non Biyori Repeat, Working!!, Working!! x2, Working!!!. You can also check out Overlord, Dandelion and Prison School.

**Spring 2015**

* DunMei was forgettable. No point watching it when we have the superior KonoSuba. go to http://hestia.dance and you've seen everything this show has to offer.
* Kekkai Sensen was so good that people ~~patiently~~ waited half a year for the final episode. It had an anime-original ending of sorts (part of anime-original main plot) but the setting and animation itself made it top tier. Also the OP and ED are glorious.
* Ore Monogatari is a cute shoujo romance where all miscommunication bullshit gets cut short instantly by the best wingman romance anime has seen in a long time. Diabetes warning.
* Shokugeki no Souma is a school battle shounen about cooking.  Personally I dropped it after the first major arc ended (episode 15), but it's definitely a good one.
* Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches - really nice school romance. Sweet, lighthearted, comedic, no bullshit. Wish more shows were like this one.
* Hibike! Euphonium - Based KyoAni.

Watch Hibike Euphonium, consider Yamada, check out the first few eps of OreMonogatari and Kekkai Sensen.

I had a good few hours (x2) to kill while travelling by train, and I had an SD card full of this thing just waiting for this to happen. Man the Yoga tablet is just perfect for watching movies in trains if you get the window seat.

It became immediately obvious that I'd be binge watching the rest afterwards. Eureka Seven is a great example of solid multi-cour shounen with closed story, something akin to Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. Aside from one obvious odd filler episode it flows really nicely, paced in a way that heavily prioritizes character development over actual timeline.

Plot - Really decent. Nothing outstanding, made out of quite typical elements, but it looks really nicely in the big picture. It keeps to its themes, gives characters time to develop and make their mark on it, and in general uncovers itself in a good manner.

Characters - The strong point of the series. They're outstandingly likeable despite their flaws. I especially liked how natural some of the interactions were. The main theme here is the romance, and there are multiple pairs involved. It's a rare sight to see such a satsfying romantic development in a shounen.

Production quality - I'm not really that good at nitpicking sound and visuals, so I'll just say they were nice. The animation was really consistent in its fluidity, the music was exactly what it had to be, with some extra credit to OPs/EDs, and the VAs were spot-on.

What this show is in the big picture - A great cross of action-adventure and romance in a mecha setting. In a way it polemizes with Evangelion, though discussing how does it do exactly treads into the spoiler territory. It's definitely an antidote to Evangelion, in a similar way to what TTGL was.

Overall rating 7/10. It's a very solid show. There isn't anything special about it, but it's definitely a satisfying experience.",2016-02-28 20:45:42+00:00,d0h8c9r,1.0,t3_484csp,9766.0,anime

Think Kill la Kill, Panty&amp;Stocking, Symphogear, Cross Ange. These action-packed shows are blissfully aware of what they are, and don't pretend to be anything more than that. I'd also count Railgun and JoJo's Bizzare Adventure into that category.

FMA:B - Well, it's the top rated shounen on all anime lists in existence for a reason. You'll get your epic fights, but you'll have to wait a bit. Quality over quantity. This is nothing like the other shounens in terms of pacing. No tournament arcs, no fights spanning over more than one episode (unless there's some REALLY GOOD explanation for it), no reason for any fight to be repeated. If you like it already it's only going to get better. You'll see what I'm talking about pretty damn soon.

Yeah, the first OP is killer, and most people will agree it's one of the best OPs of all time. Though the 4th one is pretty damn close (as for EDs, the 4th is best).",2016-02-17 23:07:58+00:00,d03t73x,6.0,t1_d03qv7w,3406.0,anime

* gensou no grimgar -&gt; okay let's speak longer about this one

So, about Grimgar. You might have noticed that it's VERY different from SAO/DanMachi in its approach to the ""adventure in a game world"" genre. I'm already recommending you Log Horizon as a good followup to SAO (basically, LH isn't anything spectacular, but it delivers some key things about ""MMO anime"" that SAO failed at), but Grimgar is what we call a ""deconstruction"" of this genre. To be fair, Grimgar isn't anything special. It's prety slow and melodramatic. But if you want something in that spirit - take a genre apart bit by bit, studying carefully how would people really behave in such situations, then you have two important anime to catch up with:

* Neon Genesis Evangelion
* Madoka Magica

However, installing this will be tricky: you will need to remove the default fan installed on the back panel of the case and put the water cooling system's fan there.

If you have an 500 GB SSD, consider dropping the idea of HDD entirely. And if you need it, you can always buy it later. Put the money saved into a better video card: R9 390. With R9 390, you will max out (or: almost max out) EVERYTHING on Ultra. I'm talking Witcher 3, Fallout 4, Rise of the Tomb Raider, GTA V with mods. 30-40 fps on Ultra, 60 if you turn down some specific settings (search for presets on Youtube, generally it will be between Ultra and High).

Some short series are also fun - I'm having a blast with Oshiete, and following Nijiiro Days and Mahou Shoujo Nantemou.

The classic typewriter standard had one significant advantage - some keys - now used for characters [];' - were used for special Polish characters (ąćęłńóśźż, some were made with typewriter tricks). As soon as the right ALT key appeared, however, it became possible to type special Polish characters by holding ALT + base character, for example ALT + L gives Ł.

So there are two keyboard layouts available on every Polish PC, the original and the now standard ""Programmer's"" one. Pressing Ctrl+Shift switches between those two, and sometimes people do that without realizing.

* Motherboard is more than enough (supports overclocking and CrossFire).
* One of the best gaming CPUs available. Only games that could demand i7 over this are simulators, ARMA and Vermintide.
* 16 GB RAM is overkill for gaming, but video editing demands it. If that ""light video production"" is to be done on daily/weekly basis, 16 is a no-brainer.
* SSD.

Now what is questionable here:

* The case is simply not up to the task. At $800 price point, especially if you want to OC, you need to add ""airflow"" and ""cable management"" to your criteria. Dust filters are also welcome. It doesn't have to be Fractal Design Define R4/R5, but Corsair 200R or Zalman Z9 are cheap and way better.
* i5-4690K is a damn powerful proccessing unit, but its main strength is its single-core performance. Tasks such as rendering and audio production are literally what i7's hyper threading was made for. If you weren't on a budget, I'd advise going for i7-4790K here. But that's $100 more.
* Do you really need a blu-ray reader?
* $800 is where you start considering upgrading from GTX 960/R9 380 to GTX 970/R9 390. At this price point a PC should have at least a $200 GPU.

I'd go as far as advicing a GPU-less build with an i7, and then saving up $300 for R9 390 straight out.

Slice of life would be nice, or sci-fi or fantasy/historical if it's done well.

Series you might find appealing are:

* **Planetes**. A unique slice of life series set in space. Imagine a good Western TV drama that can show zero-gravity environment with no budget constraints. That's basically it.
* **Hanasaku Iroha**. The main character works at a pretty Japanese place - a hot springs inn - but since she's new there, you learn that environment along with her. Great coming-of-life story.
* **Clannad**. It's perhaps the most extreme case of ""stay with this show regardless of how painfully dated the art style is, it will be worth it"". The second season, Clanad: After Story is one of the most moving things anime has to offer.
* **Steins;Gate**. Starts out calm, kinda like slice of life, and then evolves into something more intense. Should be perfect for you. Great dub.",2016-01-26 02:51:00+00:00,czc28l2,1.0,t3_42pd18,735.0,anime

1113,"&gt; That sounds too much like saying ""it's just better to read The Wheel of Time, Mistborn, or Game of Thrones after you have read The Lord of the Rings""

Yes, but not exactly. Within the realm of high fantasy, ASoIaF is rather similar to Madoka. Your comparison with GoT and LotR rather justifies me not mentioning mahou shoujo classics under Madoka.

In the live-action plane, let's imagine a new TV series takes off, clearly appealing to similar audience as GoT. However, the tropes play differently - instead of graphical violence and sex scenes, it's still classical Tolkien fantasy, but something feels... off. The online community starts calling out on its similarities with GoT, and expects the main characters to die on a horrible way very soon. But that doesn't happen. Instead, the main characters win the whole political game. The audience has absolutely no idea what's going to happen - then the show takes an unexpected turn where the protagonists have to deal with some serious, yet not exactly GoT shit, like a peasant revolt, famine or the plague. Cue tragedy. And then the ending is not as satisfying as it could have been, but after some fans read throughly into it, it turns out to be somewhat good (yet still underwhelming).

And THAT is something that is way better experienced after GoT.

LH is a perfect tool to understand what was wrong with SAO, at least in its rendition of the VRMMO premise.

Nisekoi is way more popular and fitting for the chart.

* It's a shounen through and through. The whole main cast is either unrealistically young or acts too young for their age.
* I actually liked how the main duo has progressed. For such a rage-inducing premise they played it really well.
* The main plot was really well-paced. Didn't expect it to be that nicely timed.
* I wasn't satisfied with the resolution for the secondary characters, though. [endgame spoiler](/s ""Aoki's marriage came kinda out of nowhere, she had more potential dynamic with Fukuda, but hey, it's Japan, the girl cannot be active in the relationship, it's all on the guy - also, for the love of God, Iwase has sexual frustration written all over her face, she deserved at least a one night stand with just about anyone from the cast, from either gender"")

EDIT: Overall, personally, I cannot possibly agree with a 10/10 note. I wouldn't give that even to Shirobako, and by all accounts it was a better anime, even in its halfway done state.",2016-01-08 23:57:35+00:00,cyr90w7,1.0,t3_403jeb,4175.0,anime

Qyll's works are grouped not only thematically, but also visually. Directing an AMV like his takes an insane amount of strategy. You can't make it with just the user-selected scenes. We can vote in content to be used, but it cannot be binding. And the editor will have to use the source files, not Youtube clips, anyway.

One thing that could work would be weekly contribution threads. Or something where the editor could ask ""Guys, I need clips of sword swings from Spring 2016"" or ""I need clips where the camera pans out from the character"".

We can definitely vote on the songs. It would be best if the musical pieces used could either fit more than one style of anime, or reflect the overall mood of the season (SoL heavy? battle harems? some HYPE show airing?).

1201,"Quite a few, actually. This season I have watched only OPM and Cavalry, and only due to holidays did I have any time to catch up with anything older.


Instead of reviewing the series in a normal manner, I'd like to just point out few personal takeaways from them.

**Bakuman**

Marathoned it last week, actually, but I never wrote about it then.

* I feel spoiled by watching Shirobako first, this couldn't possibly live up to it (also - different target demographics, I guess)
* Yeah no way in hell all those kids take top 10 in WSJ
* I totally do not like how this series portrays things that I believe to be problems with Japanese society. From my observation, it condones working yourself to death, absent fathers, almost sexless marriages - this just feels very much wrong.
* I rarely get explicit in my comments, but Iwase (the short-haired girl) needs a good dicking. Or a good carpet munching session, whatever floats her boat. She's got ""unresolved sexual tension"" written all over her character. I guess I could ship her with Fukuda, though my first match for Fukuda from his side would be Aoki. Overall I'm not pleased with the (lack of) resolution for some of other characters than the main four.
* I like how they did the main duo relationship. I was afraid it would be stagnant, but it was nicely done, and everyone around has pointed out how absurd it was. I enjoyed it.
* I've liked the somewhat realistic timeline, abstaining from the We Need To Finish With Graduation syndrome.

7/10 it was good.

**Claymore**

* The premise feels a little bit like The Witcher. You have a guild of monster slayers, despised by everyone, wandering from town to town. They even have the same eyes.
* Madhouse doing The Witcher anime would be instant AOTY.
* If it's supposed to be European-styled medieval fantasy, why ""Youma"" and not ""demons""?
* This is basically a vampire hunt.
* This is the first time I'd prefer anime rainbow hair over realistic approach. It was really really hard to distinguish Claymores when more than 4 appeared on screen. their distinctive trait is supposed to be silver eyes, make use of the color coding god damn it!
* At times, it shows blatant shounen tropes (the boy obviously being fostered to become the hero, Clare showcasing the typical ""ranked as worst, but potentially best"" cliche), but the graphic content makes it look like a seinen. Similar to Attack on Titan in that regard.
* Season Two Never

7/10 would watch season 2.

**Haibane Renmei**

* By the time her wings sprouted out, I was already sold. This scene was... Actually, it was heartwarming and comforting. It reminded me of the time my own mom would sit by my side when I was sick. Somehow this picture has struck the chord where other series couldn't.
* This feels like Sora no Woto, but with higher content value. As in - you can read into it and get some serious stuff I wouldn't expect from anime.
* It feels like an oil painting by one of the Reinessance artists.

It's not as emotionally heavy as the usual tearjerkers, but I see no reason why this can't be rated 10/10, at least by me.

**Kekkai Sensen**

Halfway through it, at episode 6.

* This is Durarara all over again. How am I supposed to care about so many barely sketched characters
* It feels as if it would need thrice as many episodes for me to get a grasp on it, this is where Durarara was better, by episode 7 I was just getting used to the formula
* The animation is absolutely gorgeous
* I'm bored enough to watch the other half, so I guess it's okay",2016-01-03 22:31:12+00:00,cyktrbi,1.0,t3_3zb8mu,8501.0,anime

In particular, the short story ""The Bounds of Reason"" mercilessly deals with the dragon legends. The Wawel dragon reference in particular:

&gt; ""Don't insult me, witcher, I know what it is. I've seen it. By chance I just came to Holopole for the market and I saw it with my own eyes. My ballad was already prepared, but you didn't want...""

&gt; ""Carry on. Is it big?""

&gt; ""It's as long as three horses, to the withers no bigger than a horse, but much fatter. Gray as sand.""

&gt; ""Green, then.""

&gt; ""Yes. It swooped down without warning on a herd of sheep. The shepherds ran away and it killed a dozen animals and ate four of them before taking flight.""

&gt; ""It flew away..."" Geralt nodded his head. ""That's it?""

&gt; ""No, it returned the next morning, nearer to the city this time. It dived down onto a group of women who were washing their linen at the edge of the Braa. And did they run, my friend! I have never laughed so much in my life. Then the dragon executed two turns above Holopole before attacking some ewes in a nearby pasture. What a lot of panic and confusion it started! The day before, well, nobody had believed the shepherds... the burgrave then started to mobilise a militia and the guilds, but before he had time to organize them, the people had taken matters into their own hands and sorted it out themselves.""

&gt; ""How?""

&gt; ""With a very popular method. The master shoe-maker, a certain Goateater, conceived of a means to finish off the reptile. They killed a sheep then stuffed it full of hellebore, belladonna, hemlock, sulphur and shoemaker's pitch. To be on the safe side, the local pharmacist added two quarts of boil remedy and had the priest of the Temple of Kreve bless the offering. Then they staked the stuffed sheep in the middle of the herd. To tell you the truth, nobody believed that the dragon would be attracted by one stinking piece of shit surrounded by a thousand others. But reality exceeded our expectations. Forsaking the sheep that were alive and bleating, the reptile swallowed the bait along with the stake.""

&gt; ""What then? Tell me more, Dandelion.""

&gt; ""What else can I do? I'm not going to stop now. Listen to the rest: barely enough time had passed for a skilful man to untie the corset of a lady when the dragon started roaring and emitting smoke from both front and behind. Next it did a somersault, tried to fly away and then fell down motionless. Two volunteers approached it to check if it still breathed. They were the local grave-digger and the village idiot, conceived by the lumberjack's daughter, a deranged girl who had been knocked up by a company of pikemen passing through Holopole during the rebellion of the Voivod Tracasse.""

&gt; ""What lies you speak, Dandelion.""

&gt; ""I do not lie; I do nothing but colour gray reality. There's a difference.""

&gt; ""Not really. Carry on, we're wasting time.""

&gt; ""As I was saying, a grave-digger and a courageous simpleton went as scouts. We then raised for them a nice burial mound, small but pleasing to the eye.""",2015-11-30 15:15:38+00:00,cxhxykk,3.0,t1_cxhxfap,1044.0,europe
1269,"Context:

The Wawel Dragon is one of the founding myths of Poland occurring in pre-Christian times. Some of those were made up or rewritten quite recently, but they're a huge part of Polish cultural identity.

The story is quite simple: there's a dragon terrorizing the city of Kraków, demanding virgins for meals. The king offers his daughter's hand in marriage to the knight who slays the dragon. Knights fail, shoemaker succeeds: he sets up a trap, leaving a fake sheep filled with pitch and sulfur for the dragon to eat. The dragon eats the ""sheep"" and cannot quench his thirst, so he drinks the whole of the Vistula River and blows up.

There are many other references, though. First is Hejnał Mariacki - the trumpet call played every day at every hour from the St. Mary's Church tower at the Market Square in Kraków. To commemorate the trumpeter who played it in the XIIIth century to warn the city about the Mongol invasion, the piece cuts short in the moment the legendary historical trumpeter got shot with an arrow.

The Dragon's name, Adolf Kamczatkow, is self-explanatory: it reflects the historical situation of Germany and Russia being the two greatest threats to Poland.

The song played in the credits is a cover of [""Cichosza""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m98MBACe1xk) by Grzegorz Turnau, a popular and lyrical song from the '90s that can be interpreted as a description of the Polish society after the communism has washed out the intellectual side of Polish culture (as woul dindicate the grammatically incorrerct forms used in the song, and, well, the lyrics describing the absence of great poets).

Also in the media coverage montage: Sheep, straight from the legend.

Social media montage is full of Polish memes and ""spirit"" (using typical names, phrases). The Dragon sings a popular song from the early 80's [""Najwięcej witaminy mają polskie dziewczyny""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QskK0NZB-60) with a peculiar fake German-Russian accent.

Cinematography: Although the color palette is your typical Hollywood blue-and-orange, there's some obvious anime inspirations (Ghost in the Shell, etc.) in the ""workshop"" scenes. I mean, if you're filming something with robots and futuristic helicopters, then you're basing your vision either on anime or on people who based their works on anime.

Other than that, the overall effect is... mediocre. As it was with Ambition, Bagiński is unable to make a convincing live-action piece without wooden acting and overdone effects. IMO he should stick with CGI. Live action is not his thing.",2015-11-30 14:48:06+00:00,cxhx4v5,1.0,t3_3uukhw,5196.0,europe
1270,"Right now it's dead even, so if the theory that ""immigration = rise in crime"" holds, we'll see the effect take place in the next decade at soonest.

The truth is that violent crime has always been in decline over the years. It's just the instant nature of the electronic media that makes the stories explode.

And it's not about ""non-europeans"". Poor, uneducated Polish immigrants in Norway and Great Britain also commit to the problem.",2015-11-30 00:08:05+00:00,cxhb6bi,7.0,t1_cxhatxr,543.0,poland

It might be a lot of other factors, too, like fearmongering in the media and confirmation bias (OP stated that ""there is more reports about violent crime from the West"" - is that true in the first place?).

Fact is, though, that most immigrants in the UK who kill, rape and steal do so because they're from the social demographic that resorts to crime (poor, uneducated, withdrawn from the society), not because their religion warrants it.

Rough translation, ""wkładka"" means literally ""insert (noun)"", and ""przecierać"" is indicating the ""rubbing"" meaning.

It's a bit dated form of Polish, right now the word ""filtr"" would be used over ""wkładka"" and ""nawilgotniony"" (moisturized) would be used over ""napotniały"" (...sweated?).",2015-11-29 21:54:57+00:00,cxh680m,1.0,t3_3urg1d,1407.0,poland
1275,"We're not doing anything special, we just don't have to deal with hordes of unemployed, uneducated social outcasts that cannot coexist with the general population (aka: immigrants from poor countries - ours are scarce and integrate pretty damn well: Ukrainians fit in with Poles perfectly, and anyone else who makes effort to learn Polish is practically Polish already). That alone turns the violent crime down (or at least: the perception of it in the media).

Poles are not that less violent than Britons or Frenchmen - the substance abuse (wódka, what else) could actually indicate that Poles themselves could turn out more violent than the Westerners. It's the uneducated immigrants (from Pakistan, but also from Poland) who skew the Western results - yeah, there's some violent crime in France and the UK, but have you looked at Spain or Portugal? In the end it's all about the media coverage, too. We don't have statistics from the last few years, but the ones from before 2012 cited by /u/ajuc indicate that Poland has merely caught up with the West. We've experienced a drop in violent crime, but that only made us catch up with the West, we're not some sort of safe haven.

Yes, we have some poverty. Yes, we have some regions with high unemployment. Yes, people are living from paycheck to paycheck, buying everything on credit. Yes, the pensions system is going to turn into a disaster in a few decades. But at least everyone is screwed all the same, there is a bit less social inequality than within the Western societies.

Part of the increased standard of living is thanks to the EU funds, but let's be honest - this money did not go into Polish economy. The companies that took money for building stadiums and highways are mostly owned by foreign corporations. Our profit is infrastructure. Our loss is the flow of capital to foreign giants.

There are many reasons why Polish economy didn't suffer that much in the 2008 crisis, and there are people more competent than me that could explain it. Part of the reason was our own currency - fortunately for us we are not in the Euro zone and our market is a little bit safe from the global storm than for example the Greek one.",2015-11-29 21:44:28+00:00,cxh5u6a,1.0,t3_3urgbr,663.0,poland

* Zeal has 15% AS and 20% crit. Seems to build into Hurricane and Rapid Firecannon, at the very least.
* Hunter's Talisman has +150% mana regen while in jungle, and its Jungler passive grants steals flat amount of health over time and grants bonus experience from jungle monsters (solution to lvl 2 rush?). It seems to have replaced Machete as the default starter (item code). Hunter's Machete scales with AS again.
* It seems like Trinkets change when you upgrade them. Upgrades currently available (Oracle, Farsight Orb) have their benefits and drawbacks listed. Oracles for example does not have a cast range (it works around your champion).
* New ""greedy"" starter items: Cull for powerfarming (grants some AD and flat life on hit, pays its full cost back after 100 cs, no more gold after that), Seal for cheese midlane (basically mini-Mejais that stakcs AP on kills and loses on deaths).
* Dagger cost is down to 300, has 12% AS. **B. F. Sword cost down to 1300**, grants 40 AD.
* Tiamat is Pickaxe + one reju bead, costs WAY less
* BotRK remains as it was, costs 200g more. Changes to other AD items are already covered by most other comments here: Youmuu loses crit, Hurricane gains it, Malmortius is the new better Rageblade.
* New AS component that builds out of one dagger and upgrades into charge-stacking items (Shiv and Firecannon)
* Black Cleaver changed. Now has 55 AD, but only 300 health. Retains the passives, so it's Phage + something, and that thing isn't Kindlegem, unless we're seeing errors and the components grant 100 more health than their upgrade.
* **The Brutalizer is gone.** Or rather, split into two items: Serrated Dirk (10 arpen) and Caulfield's Warhammer (10% CDR). I imagine that Youmuu builds out of two of them combined.
* Warhammer seems to build into some new items, like Death's Dance (spellvamp on physical damage and 20% damage is delayed as bleed, yeah Riven mains just came). And I guess it's the missing piece to Black Cleaver.
* New item that seems to build into Sterak's Gage, although it could end up upgrading into Frozen Mallet as well. Basically a Seeker's Armguard with same recipe as Phage and stacking HP (from 150 to 300 after 30 creeps)
* **Essence Reaver:** +65 AD, +20% crit, +10% CDR. Restores mana on critical strikes, grants bonus CDR based on crit from other sources. Core item on caster ADCs, like they said.
* Last Whisper has two upgrades: one with damage % bonus on fighting high-health targets, the other one combined with Grievous Wounds. Both grant **bonus armor penetration**, not total armor penetration. This is huge and I like it. Justifies the nerfs to armor items, as the tanks' base armor will not be shredded by LW and its upgrades anymore.
* Wit's End still sucks. Basically no changes, move along.
* Frostfang has +100% mana regen. Relic Shield has passive GP10. Talisman line lost flat MS.
* **Twin Shadows are the new active on FQC.** Nice decision, fixes both items at once.
* FotM active doesn't deal damage and slows enemies instead.
* Some minor component changes - reju bead is 150g, faerie charm is 125g, crystalline brace is 650g, sapphire crystal is 350g, etc.
* Captain enchantment is down to 450g! :)
* Boots of Swiftness seem to be 800g like Mobis.
* Many armor items - including FH, Chain Vest, Zhonya's - are slightly nerfed. Price increases, sometimes with armor increase but not always.
* Many AP items had their price go up a bit. All previously 3000g items are now 3200g. RoA is 3000g, Archangel is 3100.
* Banshee's Veil and Spirit Visage grant 500 HP and 70 MR.

The problem about this particular skillshot is that **everyone will have twice as much time to dodge it** in comparison to any other line nuke (Dark Binding, Charm).

* the stun is telegraphed - only when you get ablazed, you need to worry about it
* the cast time of precedeing spell (half a second on E, one second on W) gives you 2x more time to dodge the Q as with other line skillshots

His stun could last for 3 seconds and it would still be unreliable in high elo. If I was ever to do a Brand rework (and looking at all the reworks Riot has done this year, HELL NO), I'd give his Q a reliable knockback in all cases and change E from targeted to proccing on all nearby ablaze targets (think Sejuani E).

1366,"That's just the early game though. The true problem begins in midgame, when other mages have their powerspikes with their first and second item (Morello, Luden's/Deathcap).

Brand would love to build Liandrylai like Rumble, but he also needs mana. And if you get Morello into Rylai into Liandry, that's three items, and the midgame is over, and the enemy team will get enormous value out of any MR purchased (especially Aegis or Hexdrinker). The game might as well be over before you get to build your Void Staff - and that also means you never get to build Deathcap, unless it's your last item (and that's only if you can afford getting away without Zhonya's).

Brand's gimmick is getting ahead in skirmishes and assembling Liandrylai, preferrably without Morello, just running on two Doran's Rings and a blue buff. And that is simply unreliable strategy, just like his ult. Yeah, if he gets to assemble those items, he's very likely to win, even if he gets focused - just launch your combo, say ""allahu akbrand"" and your team will clean up the slowed, half-hp enemies. But getting there is not something to be certain of, and past the 3-4 item threshhold his winrate actually drops (below 50% as the game goes past 40 minutes).

You can criticize a lot about YYY - character design, style, character development, pacing, story, voice acting, the video game influences, whatever you've personally didn't like - but the quality of animation and music is undeniable.

1411,"Classical Polish literature, listed in chronological order:

Reinessance

* Jan Kochanowski - author of epigrams, Polish translations of psalms, some religious songs used till this day. One of his best works are lamentations written after his 8 year old daughter has prematurely deceased.

Age of Enlightement

* Fables and Parables by Ignacy Krasicki, basically Aesop's parables adjusted for the Polish audience
* Some operas and songs used till this day, but generally nothing that influential

The most important era is definitely XIXth century, when Poland did not exist on map and the literature was crucial in defining what does it mean to be Polish anyway.

Romanticism

* **Adam Mickiewicz** - THE national bard. His ballads are the cornerstone of Polish literature, heavily inspired by the folklore (think The Witcher, just without cynicism). His opus magnum is Pan Tadeusz, a national epic (think Illiad, hexameter rhymes and so on) about youth, exchange of generations and penance. Works referenced in the Witcher games:
 * Forefathers' Eve - ""Dziady"" is a pagan-esque rendition of Polish Halloween, and the scene in TW3 is basically a recreation of the play, where the Peller calls down spirits who cannot find their way to the afterlife
 * Poems - Dandelion is reciting Mickiewicz's poetry, word by word, during the quest in Act 4 of TW1.
* Julisz Słowacki - The lancer to Mickiewicz, not just his rival, but also indirectly a critic. In his works (e.g. Kordian) he criticizes Mickiewicz's concept of messianism (the glorification of the martyrdom of the Polish nation), but generally a contender for the title of national bard on his own.
 * Act 4 of TW1 is based on his play ""Balladyna"", where one sister kills the other while they gather raspberries. The name ""Alina"" was straight imported, and the name ""Celina"" became in the Polish version a reference to a rock song.
 * Fun fact: Słowacki's works were one of the references of pope John Paul the Second, who was a playwriter himself before joining the clergy.
* Aleksander Fredro - different than the two mentioned before, writer of mostly comedies, and some kinky erotica (the infamous ""13th Tome of Pan Tadeusz"" is a piece of raunchy porn). His most popular work would be Zemsta (The Revenge), and a few phrases from it became common in the Polish language.

Positivism - generally a response and direct opposite to romanticism

* From this time, short stories are a must-read in Polish schools and depict the harsh life of lower classes in the age of industrialization (Katarynka, Nasza szkapa, Miłosierdzie gminy)
* Bolesław Prus, who made few of those short stories, is also the author of Lalka (The Doll) and Faraon (The Pharaoh). Faraon is a historical novel which takes place in ancient Egypt - nothing important for the Polish cause, but a good piece of polictical literature on its own, with the famous scene in which the priests deceive the mob by predicting a solar eclipse - and Lalka is a good piece to analyze, as it showcases life in Warsaw during the Russian occupation through the eyes of a small enterpreneur, fallen stupidly in love with a shallow girl (the titular Doll).
* **Henryk Sienkiewicz** - THE guy when it comes to historical novels that take place in Poland. He basically invented the thing. His language, based on the old poems and the dialect of the mountaineers from southern Poland, is the canvas for translations of all fantasy novels right now (Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones) and the language of The Witcher.
 * Krzyżacy (The Teutons) - romantic and tragic story of knights in the late XIVth century, culiminated with the battle of Grunwald, the one of the largest medieval battles in history
 * Ogniem i mieczem (With Fire and Sword) - first in the Trilogy, takes place during the uprising of the Ukrainian Cosssacks in XVIIIth century. Looks critically at the Polish nobility, but also depicts the cruelty of Cossacks.
 * Potop (The Deluge) - the second part of the Trilogy, redemption story of a violent and arrogant nobleman Kmicic that takes place during the Swedish invasion.
 * Pan Wołodyjowski - the last piece of the Trilogy showcasing the war against the Ottomans, titled after the main character (also one of the main characters in the previous books of the Trilogy). Michał Wołodyjowski is actually considered by some people a historical character (has memorial plates and so on), even though he's entirely fictional.
 * Also: Quo vadis, a novel about first Christians in Rome, and W pustyni i w puszczy (In Desert and Wilderness), a teen novel that pretty much shaped the Polish view on Africa (the African boy Kali from the book is commonly referred to as the stereotypical African, or even stereotypical black man).
 * Sienkiewicz has received - deservedly so - a Nobel Prize in literature.

And that would be it when concerning classical literature that The Witcher is based on. Later ages, (Young Poland, interwar period, WW2), not so much - The Wedding and Chłopi (The Peasants, Nobel Prize-winning snapshot of a year of village life) being an exception. If you want to get accustomed with Polish folklore, just read anything by Mickiewicz (Ballady i romanse, Dziady).

1504,"&gt; What do you mean by this? He doesn't offer zone control in the same way standard control mages like viktor/azir/Orianna, or even Lux and Veigar do, he's really just a high damage combo mage, it's not the same thing

He's nowhere near Viktor/Azir/Ori, but he sure as hell can compete with Lux and Veigar. The sheer amount of AoE slow he delivers allows him to keep the enemy team away from objectives. And his stun lasts for 2 seconds.

&gt; I'd add Jinx here.

Oh yeah.

&gt; you already have 44.1 Mpen. Base MR for ranged champs is 30. Reducing it below 0 does nothing.

First, I'm assuming they have MR glyphs. Second, your damage against tanks drops too low if they stack MR. Overcapping on squishies is still an acceptable cost for maintaining the anti-tank power.

&gt; Even though a ton of brand's damage is passive + Liandrys, Dcap is a massive lategame damage boost. Furthermore, it helps a ton with waveclear which is one of Brand's weaker points compared to a lot of other similar ranged AoE mages.

I agree that *sometimes* Dcap might be a good idea in the lategame, but unless everyone else on your team falls off hard in that phase, Brand's lategame burst damage is not that high once they're all MRed up. That's why rather that going for burst it's better to go for DPS/survi and have your team deal the damage by that phase.

Brand's waveclear is fine, though, if you have Morellonomicon and/or blue buff. You just do it in two spells (W+E) instead of 1.

#Design

The idea behind this flowchart was my habit of watching anime with alternating mood: something entertaining followed by something ambitious, and never two ""heavy"" series in a row. Since software development is what I study, I am more than familiar with the idea of flowcharts, and I made a quick sketch of two questions ""Do you want something ambitious?"" and ""Does it have to be good?"" (as there are many series that hook you with an interesting premise, but aren't all that satisfying in the end).

Originally, the flowchart was one giant monstrosity with the ""entertaining/ambitious"" sections branching endlessly. It got WAY more traction that I ever could have expected, climbing to top #1 /r/anime posts of all time - but once the thousands of comments rolled in, people started picking up the details I've missed, like mislabeled series, typos, inconsistency, imbalance between the blue and pink frame (before purple frame was a thing), the whole thing being too confusing with the long drops (arrows that go way too far down), etc.

That's why I've decided to give the thing a few public iterations and make something that I could publish and not feel embarassed about five minutes afterwards.

#Beginner section

I've made it with three groups of newcomers in mind: teenagers too young to remember DBZ or Sailor Moon airing, adults who grew up on the forementioned series, and folks who like the Studio Ghibli movies and want something similar. Examples of people in the groups: first is the class I teach, second is me, third is my sister. For all of them, series like FMA:B and Attack on Titan will be something interesting, but there are also some more precise shots, like Mushishi for the Ghibli crowd, Magi for the young Avatar fans and Toradora as the introduction to romance.

All three comedies are more than just that because the anime comedy antics are difficult to get used to (think how distracting was the overused chibi joke im FMA:B) and the picked trio has something else going on for them. Maou-sama and Angel Beats are straight out action comedies that should take a grip on a newbie with just the action, and Toradora is an example of ""come for the comedy, stay for the drama"" that however imperfect (let's be real, some people will hate Taiga's abusiveness) can open up the whole rom-com genre to many people. Alternative for Toradora here would be Nisekoi but come on I'm not that cruel.

All the series in the beginner section are attractive for both genders (Magi, Psycho-Pass and AoT are even considered ""fujobait""), because I did not want to make any excessive notes about demographics and series with overblown fanservice tend to be offputting for beginners anyway.

#Genres

Main problem of the old layout was bundling ""cute girls doing cute things"" under ""feels"", which were considered ""ambitious"". After breaking down ""entertaining/ambitious"" into Action, Comedy, Drama and Thriller, I've realized I need the fifth category for emotionally-focused series, under the Slice of Life flag. This division isn't perfect, but the main blocks are more or less the same size.

Action-adventure is bundled together because of the huge overlap in the demand, the demographics, and the designation of particular series into one of the two genres. It would be an uneasy task to split hybrid action-adventure series into one of the two categories, and using three branches (action, adventure, hybrid) seems like excessive compartmentalization. Pretty much all of the series in that category are action-packed, and the select few non-action adventure series have been moved to ""Slice of life"" (Mushishi, Spice &amp; Wolf, Kino). Differentiating between finished and unfinished action series is something that was needed because this genre is the worst offender in that regard. ""Anime as a LN advertisement"" is a plague, and the un/finished separation allowed me to build a perfect group for binge-watching that excluded many popular ongoing series.

The ""Pure Fun"" branch is a mix of action comedies and ""guilty pleasure"" series I've personally enjoyed in their entirety (plus JoJo). This category exists for two purposes: separating non-violent action comedies (NGNL, Shokugeki) from the rest and showcasing a few ""guilty pleasure"" series that would otherwise raise eyebrows - why are those next to critically acclaimed series, why were the better ones left out, why weren't similar/ecchi series included. I don't expect anyone to have the exact same taste as me, but there is no objective way to assess trainwrecks in their value, so I went full subjective on that one. Keep in mind the whole thing is tainted with my subjective opinion on what objectivity is :)

One big disservice this chart makes is to the sports genre. Aside of few romances (Cross Game, Touch) that have been placed in a more appropriate manner, all the other sports series are bundled together in a subbranch of ""Action"" even though many of them don't have any action whatsoever, or labeling them as such is missing the point completely (One Outs, Chihayafuru). I've gotta admit, this whole section is just made in consultation with people who are fans of the sports anime (folks over at IRC), because I haven't watched any. And even though it became apparent to me some good time ago, it's an error that's been made far too early in the design phase to have an easy way to fix it.

Comedy is divided quite simply - ""normal"" work/school comedy, romance comedy and parodies. Having parodies in a separate category allowed for an all-branch disclaimer: ""you need to know what it's a parody of"". Why isn't romance a separate big category? Well, popular romance series tend to be comedies or tragedies (or both), and in some stories the romance doesn't necessarily drive the plot. I've decided then to use Comedy and Drama as main genres, and overall limit the number of main genres. So same goes for things like sci-fi, mecha, magical girls, sports. Byproduct of the design choice.

Drama is designed with adult audiences in mind. This is by far the worst section when it comes to ""what the author of the chart watched"" ratio. Half of these is my PTW list - I'm a young adult and have lots of catching up to do. There are few designs choices I'll still stand by, which is bundling the groups of mindfuck sci-fi, ambitious romances, and Ikuhara shows.

Thrillers and horrors are self-explanatory. Note that my favourite horror (Shinsekai yori) is in the Drama section.

#Choice of series

Why did I list so many new series? Three reasons. First, the footnote at the very bottom says ""important"", not ""best"". Popular new series are important because they exist in the anime fandom's minds, cosplays, comments and gif reactions. This chart is meant to be a guide to the anime as it is at a very specific point in time. I expect it to outdate in a few years (unless I update it at least annually). Second - the ""Seinfeld is Unfunny"" syndrome. Some series have used or even invented the tropes that since then have been reused, recycled, mirrored, parodied and reforged to a point where the original seems repetitive and cliched to a newcomer. Third - the old (let's define old as 4:3 and new as 16:9) animation is often uneasy on the eyes of those who come with the expectations of something similar to Avatar, Batman and Teen Titans. Sure, old anime often has better production values, but times change and tastes change with them. We the '90s kids who grew up on DBZ, Sailor Moon and Pokemon are in out mid-20s now and the new generation, even though eager to hear what we have to say, doesn't necessarily see the appeal of what we enjoyed (source: I teach kids 10 years younger than me, some of which are getting into anime). Still, this flowchart has TONS of old classics from all vintages.

Sources of consultation: tons of internet comments, hours of browsing MAL and similar sites, /r/anime, /a/, folks over at Quakenet, my students, my friends, my sisters. You're all awesome.

One big disservice this chart makes is to the sports genre. Aside of few romances (Cross Game, Touch) that have been placed in a more appropriate manner, all the other sports series are bundled together in a subbranch of ""Action"" even though many of them don't have any action whatsoever. I've gotta admit, this whole section is just made in consultation with people who are fans of the sports anime (folks over at IRC), because I haven't watched any. And even though it became apparent to me some good time ago, it's an error that's been made far too early in the design phase to have an easy way to fix it.

Comedy is divided quite simply - ""normal"" work/school comedy, romance comedy and parodies. Having parodies in a separate category allowed for an all-branch disclaimer: ""you need to know what it's a parody of"". Why isn't romance a separate category? Well, popular romance series tend to be comedies or tragedies, and in some stories the romance doesn't necessarily drive the plot. I've decided then to use Comedy and Drama as main genres, and overall limit the number of main genres. So same goes for things like sci-fi, mecha, magical girls, sports. Byproduct of the design choice.

Drama is designed with adult audiences in mind. This is by far the worst section when it comes to ""what the author of the chart watched"" ratio. Half of these is my PTW list - I'm a young adult and have lots of catching up to do. There are few designs choices I'll still stand by, which is bundling the groups of mindfuck sci-fi, ambitious romances, and Ikuhara shows.

Thrillers and horrors are self-explanatory. My only regret is not fitting in Millenium Actress and Paranoia Agent, but all fans of Satoshi Kon will find these anyway. Note that my favourite horror (Shinsekai yori) is in the Drama section.

#Choice of series

Why did I list so many new series and so little old series? Three reasons. First, the footnote at the very bottom says ""important"", not 'best"". Popular new series are important because they exist in the anime fandom's minds, cosplays, comments and gif reactions. This chart is meant to be a guide to the anime as it is at a very specific point in time. I expect it to outdate in a few years (unless I update it at least annually). Second - the ""Seinfeld is Unfunny"" syndrome. Some series have used or even invented the tropes that since then have been reused, recycled, mirrored, parodied and reforged to a point where the original seems repetitive and cliched to a newcomer. Third - the old (let's define old as 4:3 and new as 16:9) animation is often uneasy on the eyes of those who come with the expectations of something similar to Avatar, Batman and Teen Titans. Sure, old anime often has better production values, but times change and tastes change with them. We the '90s kids who grew up on DBZ, Sailor Moon and Pokemon are in out mid-20s now and the new generation, even though eager to hear what we have to say, doesn't necessarily see the appeal of what we enjoyed (source: I teach kids 10 years younger than me, some of which are getting into anime).

Sources of consultation: tons of internet comments, hours of browsing MAL and similar sites, /r/anime, /a/, folks over at Quakenet, my students, my friends, my sisters. You're all awesome.

After a while, you have simply less series on your PTW list and can comfortably pick some seasonal anime. And it's not like every season has must-watch titles - I'd say that none of the currently airing series are above 7-8/10, or at least none of them are must-watch for people who usually aren't fans of their particular genre. Year from now, there will probably be some gifs hanging around, but none of these series will be recommended outside of specific requests.

The last exceptionally ""evergreen"" season was Fall 2014, and I think UBW, Parasyte, Shigatsu, Shirobako and Yuuki Yuuna will remain important for quite some time. UBW will be always praised for its animation, Parasyte is really good for a popular horror series, Shigatsu makes for a great beginner romance/drama (""feels""), Shirobako should be a must-watch for everyone who got into anime (after a while) and Yuuki Yuuna is probably the landmark of what magical girl series will look like in the post-Madoka future.

So at some point (let's say 3-4 years) you have the freedom to watch seasonal anime, a really short list of must-watch classics, and a longer list of can-watch-if-got-free-time classics.

1750,"**TL;DR: Great series, but good Lord is the ending botched.**

Yuuki Yuuna is a definitive proof that we live in a post-Madoka era of magical girl anime. Takahiro knew it and cruelly toyed with audience's expectations, *literally playing the Death cards*. It was a simple yet masterful invocation of the ""fate worse than death"" theme, and up until episode 11 it's a perfect 10/10 series. Visuals, soundtrack, balance between SoL antics and vivid action - a friggin emotional rollercoaster of a show.

I think the defining, rare quality of YuYuYu is that you had absolutely no idea where the series was heading, and when you thought you did, your expectations were used against you. School fluff - nope, death flags - nope, no way the main threat will end at episode 5 - nope, now only healing and pure slice of life - nope, oh but there's more enemies - nope, and then there's episodes 8-11 where neither the girls nor the audience have a single clue how to get out from this situation.

And this is why the ending is bad. It was something to be expected as one of the possibilities, and as such it stands out like a sore thumb compared to the utterly unpredictable rest of the third act. Not only is it a carbon copy of Madoka even under closer scrutiny (Yuuna takes the whole thing onto herself and becomes God), but mostly because on the main, visible level it's absolutely disappointing. It's close to ""It was all a dream"". The group shows no development, no PTSD, no change. A good story starts with the characters in state A and moves them to state B. It doesn't have to be all characters - but at least *some* of them. We have the girls go from A to B... and back to A again. Long story short, Yuuna punches everything into daijoubu, and everything is like it was in the very beginning. Which includes the fact that the world is under a fucking apocalypse and its only line of defense has just retired (we can only speculate about Yuuna's future, and know nothing about the future Hero system without the help of the LN).

This could have be prevented by adding a 13th episode, simple as that. Yuuna's ascension, the changed dynamics within the group, acknowledging the uncertain future - these elements have been all absent from the finale. Hell, some of those might have been implemented even with the time we had - instead we got some stupid melodrama with Yuuna comatose for no apparent reason whatsoever other than trolling the audience into thinking there has been some permanent effect on the main cast after all.

This show was close to 10/10 and actually touched me more than Madoka. Madoka was grimdark through and through - YuYuYu made a way better connection between the fantasy drama and its impact on the real life. However, looking at this insult of an ending, there's no way I can rate it higher than **9/10**.",2015-09-12 23:25:58+00:00,cuzh5zp,1.0,t3_3kpomv,5151.0,anime

1756,"Evidence to support the theory:

* Yuuna's final transformation goes straight into her Mankai form
* All the previous Mankai have channeled the energy from the roots of Shinju-sama - Yuuna's final Mankai stems from herself
* [Visually, Yuuna's final Mankai resembles a tree](http://i.imgur.com/MRPsFij.gifv) instead of a flower like in all the other cases
* Yuuna's fairy disappears when she transforms
* Yuuna touches the Vertex with her bare hands, fighting not as Shinju-sama's hero, but as Yuuki Yuuna
* When the girls lie down, their faries turn into petals and fall onto them... except for Yuuna. Her fairy is gone, and she is the only one not covered with petals (first few angles don't focus on her, but you can clearly see it once you know what you're looking for)

And the crown jewel, lines from their play for the cultural festival:

&gt; And before they knew it, the hero was all alone.  
No one knew that the hero was alone.  
Even though she was now alone, the hero continued fighting.  
Because as long as she didn't give up, there would still be hope.

which seems to indicate that Yuuna might have become the sole hero protecting the world (which is why she fainted), as stated in [this theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2qgskv/spoilers_yuuki_yuuna_wa_yuusha_de_aru_ending/).

This might seem like an asspull, thanks to poor pacing (it should have been split into two episodes, IMO), but in Shintoism the idea of a ^(real)human being ascending into godhood is perfectly normal. And it's not the ""Creation of Adam"" moment that did it (though it was an obvious reference) - she ascended beyond Shinju-sama's contract on her own when her legs didn't work and yet she wanted to save her friends. She did what she sought to do in the very episode, which was long story short going full Madoka and taking the weight of the world onto her shoulders.

2. You write four paragraphs of disclaimers before starting to tell anything of substance. You explain the types of adapations/original animation, but a beginner wouldn't care, this type of information belongs in the FAQ at the end (why isnt there next season? why isnt there a manga of this?). You say it's between 12-24 episodes, but it's either around one number or the other, and it too belongs in the glossary/FAQ/""extra info dump"". The genre list isn't to my liking in general, and the info websites at the end aren't good either. The instruction shouldn't just gloss at the list of genres, but rather answer a question ""How do I find an anime that I will like?"" and ""Where do I watch it"".
3. The point is that action/adventure is already too big, you could split it without adding anything and it would be okay. And considering the popularity of the genre, it should be probably the first one on the list.

1868,"If you want an ULTIMATE trip to Poland:

Start in Poznań, as that's the region where the country was founded in 966. You can check out the Porta Posnania museum, which covers the beginnings of the Polish history. This, however, is a place that you can skip if you want to, as the city was burned down to the ground repeatedly by Czechs, Swedes, Germans and Russians, and most of the ""old"" buildings are ""barely"" 500-700 years old, instead of 1000 as they should be. If you decide to come here, however, yours truly is looking forward to grabbing a beer with you and giving you a tour. If you're into pub crawls/clubbing, this is one of the best places for it (20% of the people in Poznań are university students from all around the region and the country).

Move on to Kraków, the second capital of the country (from the late medieval period up until the XVIth century). Kraków is the most popular tourist hub, with main points of interest being the Wawel Castle in Kraków, the famous salt mines in the neighbouring town Wieliczka, and the German Nazi call-it-Polish-and-you're-deported-and-dead-to-me death camp Auschwitz-Birkenau. A bit away, but closer to Kraków than to anything else, is Zakopane and the Tatra mountains, a crowded but worthwhile hub for high-mountain hikes.

Warszawa is the third capital and best for following the modern history. Rebuilt from the ashes after WW2, it hosts the Museum of the Warsaw Uprising, one of the very best such facilities in the country. The Copernicus Science Centre is a great as well, and I haven't checked out the newly opened Museum of the History of Polish Jews.

We're going **ultimate**, right? That means we can't skip Malbork, the largest Gothic castle in the world. Home to the Teutonic order, it's the symbol of the medieval history of Poland. For the ancient history, there's Biskupin, but that place is too much away from everything.

If wildlife is what you're looking for, Białowieża could be your target - it's a bit secluded, but it's the last untouched part of the forest we have, and home to the population of żubr (European bison). For nature and views, the Tatra mountains are good enough, but the best course of action is to stay away from the most popular tracks and climb a bit higher.

Then there's the other big tourist places, such as Toruń, Gdańsk and Wrocław - swap one of them with Poznań at will.",2015-07-30 15:33:08+00:00,ctlm7lv,1.0,t3_3f5jeo,10772.0,poland

I understand your concern and I'm sorry I did not think of it. Problem is, as a non-native English speaker, who grew up watching English TV programming with Polish subs, watching Japanese animation with English subs is actually the preferred way for me. That's why I didn't think of highlighting good English dubs and why I'm rather unfit to assess what's good and what's not. I've seen FMA:B with dub, though, and that was my start.

&gt; You mentioned NGE is a must watch, are there other shows?

NGE is a cornerstone in anime history, but that doesn't mean you have to watch it right away. I dropped it on my first try after the first episode, only to pick it back up years later (and marathon it all in one sitting).

As for other must-watch shows, everyone has different personal 10/10s. I recognize and appreciate some must-watch shows that I'm myself not ready for yet. For now, I'd just recommend the shows that are both popular and critically acclaimed:

* Steins;Gate
* Psycho-Pass
* Puella Magi Madoka Magica (Magical Girls... done by the guy who made Psycho-Pass)
* Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann (it works best as a response to NGE, but I've watched it first and had no problems, it actually helped me appreciate the mecha genre, which I've hated before, and still look down upon)
* Comedies: Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun, Nichibros (Daily Lives of High School Boys)
* If you want to check out the romance section: Toradora!
* Once you're ready for heavier shit: Shinsekai yori (the animation is a bit like in girly anime, the story is an adaptation of a 1000-page book that could very well stand ground against school lectures)

And there's also the popular stuff like Death Note (not perfect, but still quite impressive), Attack on Titan (overtalked and overrated, but still pretty damn nice), SAO (for the love of God please trust me - it's shit), or Angel Beats! (great action-comedy-drama-feels for starters, actually). Have fun.

A good way to give people an idea on which stats are altered by items/runes/masteries:

* Remove the green color from attack speed that comes from leveling up. When you hover over AS, make it display: base AS (white) + AS from leveling up (white) + AS from items/runes/masteries (green).
* Another awesome addition would be adding a (+X%) information next to the numbers. It would make the beginners understand the mechanic without having to look it up on the wiki.
* With the main reason for colors being checking sources of stats, it could be a good idea to explore other colors. Yellow for stats from items, blue for stats from runes/masteries, runes/masteries, green for stats from both?

It's an action-comedy-drama-sliceoflife that evades such general classifications. I've figured that shows need to be labeled by the reason to pick them, and with AB it's often the humour.

1906,"That's a fair criticism and actually something I was well aware of from the get-go.

First, let me assure you that the flowchart was not designed first as bottom-up, but top-down. Essentially the initial idea with the first version of the chart was a pair of questions: ""Do you want something entertaining or ambitious?"" and ""Does it have to be good?"". That idea came from my personal tendency to switch between lighthearted, dynamic shows and serious, ambitious stuff - sometimes I'm in a mood for one, sometimes for the other.

Words next to arrows, instead of the green boxes - In some places, the description of the end node is much longer than the question itself. I could put more weight on questions, but that would limit the number of possible answers to 2-4 per question, and I find the multi-answer blocks pretty handy. This way I can cover a dozen shows in a very confined space. There is no way in hell this flowchart could exist if I were to break down every single genre in a meaningful way.

1907,"Okay, so, until I get a better label, I'll defend the Steampunk label, since I need it to label genres in a short manner to fit in the boxes.

Thing is, what other anime would be a better example of steampunk? This is a loaded question, since steampunk in a pure form is something simply not found in mainstream culture at all, but really, how many other anime shows with 1800s-1900s setting are there? How many of these shows have accelerated scientific progress in *some* disciplines, while staying true  to the historical period in others?

Steampunk is about presenting a XIXth century technology progressed over its actual historical record, without relying on electricity as power supply, therefore creating parallel development that we haven't got to in our time. More often than not the steam devices are way ahead of its time, and sometimes even impossible to recreate right now. And everything is supposed to be mechanical. Guess what:

* FMA has **automail**. This technology alone brings it close to steampunk. It's way ahead of XIXth century, and even right now with all the electronics we have, we can't do something like that.

* FMA uses steam-powered trains as the main means of long distance travel. There are cars and even tanks, but they are not used in long-distance travel by the main characters.

* Magic is scientifically described and subjugated. Alchemy is FMA's steam power.",2015-07-20 21:18:03+00:00,cta5fen,4.0,t1_cta4xzi,738.0,anime

1915,"Ellen Pao was the interim CEO of Reddit. She gained a lot of hate from the Redditors for the decisions made by the company during her cadence. The hate towards her was fueled by the facts that:

* Pao was a laywer, and not an engineer (the feeling that ""corporate people are taking over what was built by users for the users)
* Pao made some mistakes that might have created an impression that she does not understand how to use Reddit, submitting a link to a message in her own Reddit inbox (further building up the forementioned ""she's an outsider who doesn't deserve to rule over us"" feeling)
* Pao's husband was allegedly involved in a huge fraud (I've seen the phrase ""a marriage of sociopaths"" repeated more than once)
* Pao sued her former employer for gender discrimination for millions of dollars. She lost the trial. (and thus she became the anti-discrimination version of ""the boy who cried wolf"")

The ""Ellen Pao debacle"" /u/Oidoy referred to is the hate train against her that was based on both information relevant to her competence as the Reddit CEO and information that was less relevant to it, but made people dislike her.

In the end, there were some accusations against Pao that were on-point, but the redditors were overeager to paint her as the main villain of the story, while the truth was much more complicated. Lately some statements emerged that might indicate that the most unpopular decision in history of Reddit - firing Victoria - was in fact ruled by someone above Pao, but it was still her who took all the hate and stepped down from the CEO function shortly after.

---

Considering its popularity in the thread where I linked it, I've decided it deserves its own post. It is by no means the final version, so any sort of feedback is appreciated.

* Made with [draw.io](http://draw.io) extension for Google Docs. If you're interested in collaboration to make it more accurate or readable, let me know.
* **Choice of shows:** either seen them (60%), had them recommended to me by friends/family (20%) or just know about them from discussions here and there (here being /r/anime, there being MAL toplists and /a/).
* **Why only new shows?** Because I'm relatively new to this whole thing. Also because part of the watching experience is the fanbase, and a beginner would probably want to watch stuff that they can hear good things about from other people.
* **Yes my taste is shit.** Wouldn't expect any other reaction. And yes, I'm biased.
* Bigger list of ""noobtraps"" excluded from the list: AgK, Elfen Lied, Tokyo Ghoul, OreImo, Bleach, DxD. There was no strict criteria on what is supposed to be on the chart (100 top rated? 100 most popular?) so the end result is a byproduct of trying to be objective and failing at it.
* **Blue and pink borders:** blue is supposed to be a ""prude-friendly"" filter (avoid if you think you're better than that), pink is the ""maybe start here if you're a girl"" indicator. Pink ones aren't necessarily targeted for girls, but are popular among them. Something like with Supernatural. I took the data from all the gender-profiled surveys from charapedia.jp posted here from time to time. I'm a guy though and these ones are all popular among guys as well, even the shoujo stuff. Yona is nice, GSN is hilarious, Nana is a classic, and so is Cardcaptor Sakura... even though I've dropped that one after a few episodes.
* Size of the chart might seem overbearing, but I have no idea how to trim it down without removing key genres and most popular shows. Some folks I've talked into anime wanted some silly fun, some wanted hard sci-fi (preferrably cyberpunk), and some are fans of the calm slice of life stuff like Mushishi. I took all these ""I'm new to anime and I'm looking for..."" situations into consideration.
* There will be a new version next week or later, I'm listening to your feedback. I'm probbaly gonna drop the ""beginners"" part from title and expand the chart to include classics such as Rurouni Kenshin, Trigun, White Album 2, JoJo, Utena and Penguindrum.
* There are some inconsistencies or errors in the chart, already pointed out. For example: Knights of Sidonia, pinned to the mecha hub, is not a finished action show, Eureka Seven can be approached from ""Mechas? No."" side, and Slice of Life needs its own branch, as in the current state we have K-On under ""Ambitious -&gt; Drama -&gt; Feels"".
* The only correct watch order for Fate is READ THE VISUAL NOVEL FIRST. On a serious note, if starting anime-only, both F/z start and UBW start have their pros and cons.
* Also, it needs to get stretched sideways, I know.",2015-07-08 20:49:35+00:00,cswmoxh,1.0,t3_3clgdk,96.0,anime

2015,"&gt; I don't know what half these words mean...

The skin is a reference to a **""harem"" trope in Japanese animated series (anime)**, where the male protagonist is surrounded by female characters, all developing romantic feelings for him. The viewer is supposed to identify with the main character (MC), and in most shows like that the protagonist is a bland, generic character with ridiculously thick plot armor (a term ""self-insert"" might be appropriate). If a show is not labeled as harem but turns into one, it's usually a sign of poor writing (it can still be entertaining, just clearly mediocre pulp fiction, see: Sword Art Online).

Harem shows are somewhat related to Visual Novels, Japanese choose-your-own-adventure video games in which the player can end up dating one of select few girls - such a game has multiple endings (routes). Harem anime are mostly romantic situational comedies. Some are heavily pandering to the male audience with quasi-erotic content (ecchi). If the story ends with MC dating one of the girls, she ""wins"" the harem and the story is closed. If the anime is based on an ongoing comic book (manga) series, or a visual novel with all endings considered equally ""true"", the animated series will most likely have no definite conclusion and the romance will always remain in the status quo.

The idea is that guys love to watch shows with diverse female cast. Harem setting allows to fill the cast with various interesting female characters, while cutting down on the male ones. Similarly, shows with diverse male cast end up popular with the female audience (even the action shows originally catered towards male audience). There is also ""reverse harem"", where the female main character is surrounded by male characters.

If you don't believe the ""teens/young adults love to watch series with cast made of the opposite gender"", look at the Western examples: Supernatural (male cast, male audience, female fanbase) and My Little Pony (female cast, female audience, male fanbase).

&gt; Q: Send all girls/soldiers to target location, screaming ""kyaaa~"" on the way there

""Kyaaa"" is the Japanese equivalent of ""Eeeek!"". Commonly used in anime whenever a girl is embarassed, for example when the MC walks on her changing or ACCIDENTALLY falls down and gropes her boobs. Yeah. Harem anime is anything but subtle. 90% slapstick comedy.

&gt; W: Summon a girl/soldier. Each one you summon has a different personality, for example, the first one would be a tsundere, the second one would be a yandere, and the third one could be a kuudere. When they are summoned they could have a quote pertaining to their personality. (ex: I-It's not like I wanted to help you out, anyways... ba-baka...)

Most harem shows follow the standard pattern, in which every girl in the harem presents a contrasting personality. the most popular cliches have been grossly overused, or rather utilized as the archetype for the characters.

* **Tsundere** is the girl who appears agressive, cynical, rude and tough, but slowly begins to ""break her shell"" and fall for the MC. Until then, she's in denial over her own feelings (""I-It's not like I wanted to help you out, anyway...""). She can start out as the violent misfit, or as the prude class representative. Usually the one MC will end up with, if she's the only one with any sort of character progression. Her bipolar nature can be exaggerated and included as part of the comedy (...all of the anime) or expanded upon as a mental issue (Neon Genesis Evangelion, arguably Toradora!)
* **Yandere** is the Overly Attached Girlfriend with a chainsaw. She's probably on the verge of murdering all her love rivals, in a brutal way (but since 99% of harems are comedy, she never will). She's mostly there for the comic relief - unless she's the only love interest of the MC (Mirai Nikki), or the show goes down with a blast (School Days).
* **Kuudere** is the reserved, emotionless, stoic, peaceful girl. Attraction for the MC is the first and only feeling she develops. She's either the only normal person in a looney house of a cast, or the traumatized shell of a person (NGE, Sora no Woto).

There are also other archetypes, not mentioned in this post, like ""that lovely childhood friend the MC was in love with once"", or ""that girl who confessed her love to the MC right away, so no way in hell she's ever gonna win"".

&gt; E: Dashes to a girl. The girl then proceeds to say ""S-Senpai..."" as she isn't prepared for Azir's sudden advances onto her.

""Senpai"" is how Japanese people refer to their seniors at school and at work. Your upperclassman is your senpai. Let's say it's in some way similar to saying ""Sir"". You can add ""-senpai"" as a suffix to a person's name, but that is rather common in a work setting, bashful schoolgirl will barely squeeze a ""senpai"". The word is so overused it's became a running joke long time ago.

&gt; R: Summons the student council to push back enemies.

Most harems are highschool romance comedies, so the student council is often part of the supporting cast, or even the main cast. If the main cast is not friends with the student council, their intervention is SERIOUS BUSINESS, as in most anime the authorithy of student council is grossly exaggerated (as is everything).",2015-07-07 15:24:18+00:00,csv1dy4,2.0,t1_csuvwlm,10875.0,leagueoflegends

2059,"Best order is: read the books, then play the games in release order (games are a sequel/spin-off to the books).

However, story-wise the games are made specifically with new players in mind. W1 starts with amnesia cliche (gone in W3) and the first two games feature characters from outside the book main cast. The main cast from the books (besides the protagonist) comes back fully in W3. That being said, W1 and W2 have HORRIBLE tutorials/starts, it's one of these things you have to recommend to people with a clause ""give it some time, it will totally pay off"".

W1 was made on an archaic engine (Aurora, the one Neverwinter Nights was on) and has a very simplistic combat system (comes down to pressing mouse button in a time window). However, the atmosphere is unmatched. The game ages quite well. If you see anything that fits your taste, stick to it, as it only improves in further chapters (and there are five + prologue + epilogue). The ending is... well, it's something.

W2 has DarkSouls-esque action-packed combat, with more emphasis on moving around and traps. The story is more intense, compact, but a bit shorter. The prologue is difficult to get through, the tutorial is a band-aid added in Enhanced Edition and the final chapter is underwhelming thanks to financial problems forcing earlier release, but chapters 1 and 2 are outstanding, with chapter 2 having two completely separate areas depending on your choices (different characters, different main quest, different side quests) that makes the second playthrough really worthwhile (basically you learn details you wouldn't possibly know in the other route).

W3 is pitch perfect. In the event the first two games didn't fit your taste, skip to the third. They literally took everything that was wrong with the previous games and fixed it. The game has 94% average score on Metacritic and got 10/10 from Gamespot (one of 9 perfect notes in their history).

One selling point of The Witcher that I don't see very often: in these games, there are quests you can epicly fail. And it's not a ""you failed, please load a save file"" situation - it's that an action you thought was correct leads to an unforseen catastrophic outcome hours later. W1 and W3 have investigation quests that can finish with accusing the wrong suspect, and only later on you'll realize your mistake (my roommate hasn't even realized he got the wrong guy in W3 until I told him). W2... let's just say that having played the Iorweth route the second time gives you an enormous ""Oh shit, I didn't know that X was actually Y"" realization that's not accessible in the Roche route.",2015-06-16 14:16:39+00:00,cs8cym2,3.0,t1_cs8c7zw,1414.0,gameofthrones

#What now?

You like GoT and want to experience something similar, but books are too heavy for you? Here's a short list.

##I want a video game
[**The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYwe_WHARdc). When it comes to video games, many titles fall flat when it comes to story. Take the famous Skyrim: its plot is vast as an ocean, but shallow as a puddle. The Witcher video games are based on the renowned Polish books (google for fan translations) that are quite similar to A Song of Ice and Fire in how they approach the fantasy genre, but instead of featuring political schemes of noble families, it focuses on a few (extra)ordinary people caught in the political machine. The Witcher video games provide dozens of hours of intrigue and difficult moral choices. Forget any karma systems - in those games, your choices aren't black and white, there is no clear good and clear evil and the consequences will come to bite you in the back in the least expected form and moment, hours after you've made the decision. Plus it's one of the best video games of all time. Plus the studio that made it is the single biggest pro-gamer entity on the market. Plus Charles Dance (Tywin Lannister) is a voice actor there.  
Also: **Crusader Kings II** with GoT mod. It's a thing. If you like strategy games, this seems like the perfect choice. There's also the obvious answer: **Telltale Game of Thrones** video games.

##I want an epic fantasy movie, not necessarily of the same type
**The Lord of The Rings: Extended Edition**. 11 hour version of the nerd Bible and it's a huge misunderstanding if you haven't seen it yet. It's not as gritty and edgy as GoT, of course, but it's the foundation of every fantasy story of the last century. Keep in mind GoT is the antithesis of LotR in terms of character development, conflict and story building - LotR is idealism, GoT is realism. It's nice to know the context, though.

##I want another realistic, multi-layered TV series by HBO
**The Wire**, without a doubt. Like GoT, it follows many different characters from various social circles and makes no compromises with reality. Experience the policework as it truly is and watch the stories of different layers of American society in the neverending war on drugs. You've ever noticed that in the procedurals they never show the immensive paperwork that comes with busting criminals? Here's the show that will spoil the procedurals for you forever.  
Also: **Rome, Boardwalk Empire, The Sopranos**

##I want TV series about people in power
**House of Cards**. There's a reason this show gets so much praise: because it really deserves it. Watch the plots and schemes of Frank Underwood, a man so despicable and yet so cunning that you'll have mixed feeling rooting for him.

##I want fantasy, but something light, less grim and dark
Try **Merlin** or **Legend of the Seeker**. Both shows are... average, in terms of quality, but will provide a fair deal of fantasy fun. Also, Merlin shares quite a few supporting actors with GoT (maester Luwin, Davos, etc.)

##Something animated that's not just for kids?
**Avatar: The Last Airbender** (TV show) and its sequel **The Legend of Korra**. How is it similar to Game of Thrones? Well, there's war, there's ambiguous morality on all sides of the conflict and so on, but the truth is you simply need to watch this show, even though the connection isn't really strong. If you don't have a gag reflex to animated series, this is most probably the best kid show ever made, period. Note: it's a ""kid show"" in the same regard Empire Strikes Back is a ""family movie"".  
After that one, **Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood**. In some regards, quite deeper and more mature (on-screen blood, death and some serious existential shit), definitely not a kid show. 

##Thanks for your personal recommendations. Anything else you'd like to piggyback?
**Firefly**. Go and watch Firefly.",2015-06-16 11:18:41+00:00,cs88oca,1.0,t3_3a0uxc,3836.0,gameofthrones
