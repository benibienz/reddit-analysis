* Is the advice given in each section of the guide:
 * factual
 * helpful?
* Would ""worst thing since 30 FPS locks"" be a better joke than ""worst thing since paid mods"" or ""worst thing since Gameworks""?

Of course the guide had its moment of glory and any damage it could do is already done (thankfully: not much), but there are two matters worth tending to: the build guides, which are linked and can still be fixed, and the circulation of this infographic inside this sub, which could utilize a refurbished edition.

#Builds

* $400 http://pcpartpicker.com/guide/qB7Ycf **UPDATED CPU, CHECK IT**

* $1300 http://pcpartpicker.com/guide/NgKH99 
* $1800 http://pcpartpicker.com/guide/MTV323 

I've already made some serious improvements to the build guides.

* Scaled down on cases in $400 and $600 builds
* Changed the PSUs in $400, $600 and $900 builds to higher tier ones
* Managed to squeeze in better CPUs:
 * **FX-6300** instead of **X4 860K** in the $400 build
 * **i5-6400** instead of **FX-8350** in the $600 build (yay!)

#[Infographic](http://i.imgur.com/xFj9QQ7.png)

The most glaring errors I've picked from gathered complaints:

* The whole ""Maxed at 4K"" misunderstanding. We need better terms about the quality one can expect from listed video cards.
* Typos and errors like ""proccessor"", ""i5-6500K"", ""quieter"" etc.
* ~~""VSync causes input lag""~~
* ""There is no benefit from faster RAM"" (there is, just very little in specific situations)
* $500 for 980/Fury being a shit tier (Nano? 390X?)
* Not enough about monitors
* No X99 for the very high end (to be fair I haven't touched an X99 motherboard in my entire life)
* Mechanical keyboard meme (it feels great yo)

[Pyrkon](http://pyrkon.pl/2016/) is the biggest fan convention in Poland, dedicated to all sorts of fantasy - books, comics, movies, and TV series. At attendance of 40 000 people, (up +10k from last year) it's one of the biggest fan covnentions in Europe. Here's a video clip showcasing [last year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2Kh-iGHzaI) and the first one from [this year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leqXl5Sy5b0).

One of the core elements of the con is of course the Anime&amp;Manga block, with tons of vendors and hundreds of cosplayers wandering around. It's also the only block that runs its panels even after midnight, up to 4 AM.

I gave two out of my three panels in that block, one of them being titled ""How to find something for yourself among so many anime series"" and the other ""Western fantasy in manga and anime"". Both were met with warm reception and full house, with people lining up outside.

The first panel was heavily inspired by the Flowchart, but obviously we weren't studying it throughly. The mention of Reddit community was removed from the panel description by the staff (just /a/ small joke), but I still gave you guys some credit :P To be honest, the point of the presentation could have been summed up as ""Move on to the English part of the Web and learn to browse MyAnimeList/AnimeDB databases"". But it was nice nevertheless.

The second presentation was... not spot on. Shortly after starting I've realized I'm preaching to the choir, cause 90% of the people listening to me already know what I'm saying. Instead of showcasing a specific selection of series, I really should have tackled the subject in an acedemic manner, dissecting the themes and tropes within the genre. At least people haven't walked away from it, so I guess that's nice.

Other than that, it went as expected. Or even better. I was honestly afraid of some cliche groups of people - the cringe, the sausage fest, the esports fans dominating the event, the MTG buttcracks - but it turned out pretty okay. I was surprised how normal and laid-back the demographics have turned out.

Not to mention I've made friends with the staff and am definitely going to help out even more next year.

Turns out fan conventions are pretty fun. 5/7 would go again.

I won't be posting the pictures without the parents' consent, but I've helped one of my students and an acquintance's son with assembling a gaming rig. Both were based around the R9 390 card.

Unfortunately, the SSDs I've picked turned out to be faulty. A local Polish manufacturer GOODRAM, known for, nomen omen, good RAM sticks, has apparently shipped an unlucky batch of drives (CX100). Some of those work without problems, but these particular two malfunctioned three weeks after purchase. GOODRAM is sending a courier tomorrow to pick them up, bypassing the retailer's RMA.

I've had both of the PCs shipped to me. I'm reinstalling Windows, (new SSD in case #1, hard drive in case #2 with the intention to clone it once the SSD comes back). We've already had a blast assembling and configuring it, now it's time to simply redo the proccess.

Both boys have... had consoles. As you can guess their main purpose now is providing the gamepads. Here's the question: What games would they enjoy the most? Prefferably:

* single-player games for the 10 y old that showcase top tier PC graphics
* I assume for the 14 y old it's almost ""everything"" aside from the explicit 18+ stuff (Skyrim yes, Witcher no)
* some games that work well with the XBox controller
* games that utilize two gamepads

One thing I'd love to find is a **couch two-player game that utilizes 4K resoultion**. I just want to get one of these machines to the living room and show what their 4K TV is capable of. Does Trine 2 support 4K? Also remember it's on R9 390, so older games that can work on 1440p/4K at decent framerates are good enough.

Games I have on my mind now are:

* Heroes 3, Warcraft 3
* Tomb Raider Anniversary
* Gothic 1-2-3

This was my early teenage years. What would work for them now? I'm thinking about recommending:

* LEGO series, duh
* the new Need for Speed
* Rocket League
* the older one might be interested in Starcraft 2 (he loved Dawn of War)
* Trine and Portal series seem perfect, since the 14 y old one has a younger brother (I'm cleaning up an older LGA 775/GT6800XL build for him, will probably need to buy a new BTX motherboard tho)

What other games are worth recommending to PCMR novices?

I think the best way is semi-weekly discussion threads. Or at least every few days when I have some big changes to discuss. I think 4-5 iterations would be needed at the very least.

This is the question for the first thread. Please state what things about the flowchart feel wrong, lackluster, imperfect. The more nitpicky the better.

Stuff I'm already thinking about:

* Obviously, we're going to update the featured series in general. In the last few months there were several noteworthy series that may be relevant to many people's interests. Which ones? You tell. I think one example is One Punch Man.
* The Sports section needs to be rebuilt from the ground up. Some series, like Kuroko no Basket and Haikyuu, deserve to remain in the Action region, but many others, such as Chihayafuru and One Outs, should be moved to proper categories.
* I need expert consultants on:
 * sports (see above)
 * old mecha shows
 * old anime in general
 * shoujo/josei series
* It's been noted that the current colored borders are problematic. I'm up to discuss this subject, but I'm still not convinced yet we need a separate border for series pandering to the female audience - there's really not that many listed. Yes, it's imbalanced, but that's just how the numbers are.
* I'm not sure if the flowchart is perfect for Bot-chan's auto-replies. I think [this general chart](http://imgur.com/0MipXEQ) might actually be better, especially for mobile users. You're welcome to discuss this as well.

One of my side projects are ""regular"" charts, and some of them got viral in select places (9gag, imgur, funnyjunk, etc.). However, in hindsight I've found them to be heavily flawed and in dire need of refurbishing. Abandoning the project is not an option because people keep reposting this shit months after the initial release, and it has my name on it.

#The general chart

http://imgur.com/Dcra38m

This project is almost done, but I'd like to hear out your opinions. I've ran it through imgur, 9gag and 4chan and gathered some meaningful feedback (...mostly on 4chan). Your role right now is to nitpick as much as you can - suggest what shows should be replaced with what, which thumbnails should be replaced, which captions are inaccurate, etc.

Few words about this thing:

* I don't think I need to explain the basic idea. There's 12 categories and the bonus ""WTF"" zone, each  of them with one beginner-friendly show leading into it.
* The choices are supposed to be somewhat noob-friendly. No VOTOMS. No Rose of Versaiiles.
* Some categories are not a broad snapshot of the genre, but rather a subsection of it, sharing a specific theme. Hence the ""darker"" mood in the Action section, psychological theme in sci-fi, tragedy/melodrama tendency in the Drama section.
* This leads to some series not fitting anywhere, or some other categories being bend towards series which belong to the genre, but aren't a typical representative of it. Example: magical girl seris in the Romance section (though that placement is very much intended considering that block is supposed to lean towards the female audience)
* ""Exceptional"" seal of approval is awarded subjectively to series that stand out within their own category. Bakemonogatari used to have it while it was in the Romance section, for example.
* ""Unfinished"" seal marks a show with a particularly abrupt end or with heavy indication ""the best part was not adapted yet"". Or something that's still ongoing. Let me know if I've mislabeled anything.
* The horror section was cut in half due to a lack of good series to recommend. The casualty of that downsize was Dusk Maiden of Amnesia, which I'd recommend if there was some space for it. The benefit here is the expansion of the Adventure category, now full of three types of road trip series: chillout slice of life (Mushishi, Spice &amp; Wolf), fantasy (Yona, Bahamut, Magi) and sci-fi (Yamato, Trigun).

We have plenty of time to polish this one, I'll be posting the new version in 2-3 months at the earliest.

#The ""get a taste"" chart

Here's where things get ugly.

http://imgur.com/1H1tPqT

This one is the main reason for creating this thread. It's old, it's pretentious, it's rude - it needs a complete rewrite. Unfortunetely I can't just leave it away because it keeps getting reposted and it has my name on it.

So, I'm looking for feedback on how to remake this. Here's what I'm trying to accomplish:

* The chart is supposed to point out pairs of series that are similar in some regard, and suggest that moving on from X to Y is a good idea if you find X underwhelming in some regard, even if you can't just point out what was wrong exactly.
* The second show is not supposed to be some hidden gem classic masterpiece, just something that can help explore the depth of the genre, or just put the first show in a new light (in some cases: help understand what the first show's flaws were).
* I'm aware it has too many words. The new version will use 16:9 thumbnails and much shorter text box.

Here's the pairs I'm currently considering:

Move on from | to
-|-
SAO | Log Horizon
Evergoing shounens | finished shounens
AoT | ~~FMAB~~ ?
Aldnoah.Zero | Code Geass
Akame ga Kill | Berserk/Claymore
Death Note | Monster
Nisekoi | Toradora + other romances
Romcoms | Romance dramas
Slasher horrors | Shinsekai yori, Mononoke
Angel Beats | Haibane Renmei
One Punch Man | ? (KlK?)

Feel free to add new pairs or comment on the current ones.

Here's the nods and references to Polish literature and culture in Hearts of Stone.

---

* As you guys probably already know, the whole story of Olgierd von Everec is based on [**Jan Twardowski**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Twardowski), legendary sorcerer who was said to have sold his souls to the devil in exchange for his powers.  
It's not just the premise, though - the story of Twardowski includes **requesting three trials**, **meeting in a seemingly impossibly far place** (in Twardowski's legend - Rome, substituted with an inn called ""Rome""), **the moon** (Twardowski recalled a prayer halfway through to the other side, and got dropped off at the moon instead of going to hell), and **summoning the dead** (Twardowski was Poland's Rasputin, [summoning the queen's ghost for the mourning king](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Wojciech_Gerson_-_Zjawa_Barbary_Radziwi%C5%82%C5%82%C3%B3wny.jpg))

* In the very first scene when you meet Everec, one of his comrades is showing off his new sabre. His name - **Bohatyrowicz** - is taken straight away from a novel Nad Niemnem. His sabre's name - **Tradycja** (Tradition) is a reference to a cult classic '80s movie ""Miś"" which was a satrie on life under Communism.  
In that movie, a wagoner wants to call his daughter that, and he uses a newspaper as evidence; the report goes ""A new secular tradition was born"" (the joke seems to make fun of wagoner's stupidity, but in fact it's also a comment on the government's approach to replace the Catholic tradition with secular ceremonies).

* One of Olgierd's comrades says ""Jedzą, piją, lulki palą,. Tańce, hulanki, swawola"" (They eat, drink, smoke pipes. Dances, carouses, frolics), which is a direct quote from Mickiewicz's ballad **Pani Twardowska**, a satirical rendition of the story, in which the Devil's third trial by Twardowski is to live for a year with Twardowski's wife, the titular Mrs. Twardowski. Upon taking a good look at the woman, the Devil runs away and never comes back.

* The fight against Olgierd is based directly on the famous sabre duel from ""Potop"" (The Deluge), a classic of historical fiction set in the 17th century. You can watch the duel [here](https://youtu.be/r-mnfJvSDkU?t=2m39s). Quotes used: ""Może waść chcesz zaczekać, aż siąpić przestanie"" (roughly ""Maybe you want to wait until it stops raining"", just add tons of historical grammar stylization onto it), ""Waść machasz jak cepem"" (""You swing it like a flail"", again with the old-fashioned colour), ""Wiedźmina będą chować, to niebo płacze"" (They'll be burying a witcher [original: a colonel], so the heavens cry), and of course the famous ""Kończ waść"" (in the book/movie: ""Kończ waść, wstydu oszczędź"" - ""Finish this, spare the shame"").

* The wedding in Bronowitz draws inspiration from the famous stage play **Wesele** ([The Wedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wedding_%281901_play%29)) by Stanisław Wyspiański. The play occurs in village Bronowice and in its second act spirits of the past haunt the guests.  
The Polish version of the game uses a few quotes from the play, for example ""Trza być w butach na weselu"" (Gotta wear shoes at the wedding). That phrase in the play sums up the stubbornness of the bride whose feet hurt but refuses to dance without shoes, as she needs to keep up appearances.  
Read more about the play [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/3oo1yu/the_wedding_some_background_form_the_polish/). I wrote this before HoS came out and thought the wedding would play a bigger part in it.

* More quotes go during the wedding: ""Daj ać ja pobruszę, a ty poczywaj"" are the first Polish words ever written down in history. ""[Niedźwiedź niedźwiedź chuj nie niedźwiedź](https://youtu.be/IHZCqlbM-9g?t=24m07s)"" (Bear bear fuck no bear) is not a quote from anything but it's ridiculously funny, completely lost in translation, and a rare example of Geralt cursing so badly.

* When discussing the moving of the auction house to Oxenfurt, the phrase ""przyjazne państwo"" (friendly state) is uttered. That was a name of an actual government comission in Poland few years ago. The project was barely more than a PR stunt, hence quoting the name as a joke.

* One of the auction house guards sings [Gaude mater Redania](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HNaZsuuzsA), which is a note-by-note copy of [Gaude mater Polonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaude_Mater_Polonia), song traditionally performed at the beginning of the university year.

* Van der Knoob in Polish is ""van der Hooy"". Foreign ""Hooy"" is pronounced same as ""chuj"" (dick, a swearword of the highest degree).

* Vivaldi offers a loan in Kovir marks. There's an ongoing issue of Poles who took loans in Swiss franks years ago before the exchange rate plummeted, and if the government should buy them out.

* The safebreaker Quinto is based on Kwinto, famous fictional character from the heist movie [Vabank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2xgzwfuxjs). Also a legendary safecracker.

* Everec mentions ripping his shirt out of desperation. It's a reference to Tadeusz Reytan, a nobleman who just as desperately and just as unsuccessfully tried to stop the partitions of Poland, as pictured on [this famous painting](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Rejtan_at_Sejm_of_1773_by_Jan_Matejko%2C_1866.png).

All people in their kingdom could perform basic telekinesis with the use of Light of Mana. All, with the exception of rare exceptions called Norma - anti-magical beings with the capability of breaking forcefields created by Light of Mana. Norma were deemed abomination and sacriledge, and the princess was rightously against them, even suggesting that detaing them might not be harsh enough.

Then everything went to shit.

As it turned out, the princess was a Norma herself all along. Every task that required the use of magic so far has been performed by her loyal maid for her. She didn't see anything odd about it, as after all she was a princess and certain tasks were beneath her.

#Why would I want to watch this, anyway?

Because it's fun. The unobstructed, crazy type of fun that breaks all possible inhibtors in your conscience, silencing all the little voices saying *""You can't like this. This is stupid""*. It's a show that nobody will call ""good"", because it doesn't even try to be good. It's ridiculosly, insultingly bad, and it knows you know it.

But my God it is entertaining. There's dragons, guns, magic, mechas, Nana Mizuki singing, hot-blooded action, all sorts of fun. Not to mention the wonder when you realize not even the writers see any sense in it and might have been making this shit up on the go as far as plot is concerned (with few insert episodes, it's Jun Maeda levels of ""And now, let's add some...""). And even though at first it's the Valvrave type of entertainment ""Let's see if it can get any more crazy"", with time it actually develops a plot. Nonsensical, but a consequential and engaging plot nonetheless. At first it was deemed another silly fun on par with simultaneously airing Twintails, but over the course of its two-cour airtime, it became something far more than that.

What you're truly watching it for, though, is...

#Isn't this just a steaming pile of lowly fanservice?

At first glance, yes it is. It lures in the otaku crowd with ~~yuri~~ lesbian sex scenes, absurdly cleaved plugsuits, all sorts of lewd takes that focus on different parts of female body, and to some people this will be absolutely inexcusable. The outrage the first episode alone made in the online media was kinda understandable.

However, if you can sit through it, or if you're actually enjoy that sort of thing... it changes. A lot. In my opinion thats actually the main takeaway from this series. **Ange is one of the strongest, most BASED female protagonists in the history of anime**, and would make top 10 of most lists. And what's the best about it is that unlike the other famous female leads she doesn't start that way. She's a spoiled delusional princess, and it takes her the whole show to grow from there. Think Yona of the Dawn, on industrial amounts of crack. The end result is a determined, confident protagonist who takes no shit from anyone and makes the whole world play by her rules. Ange is a woman everyone - audience included - comes to respect.

Then there's the issue of the antagonist. Stories are often dragged down by lame, one-dimensional villains, but this one takes the cake. Just like the whole show, the villain is so laughably poorly written that... you take a second look, and discover a simple yet powerful message behind the character. [The villain is basically ](/s ""an exquisite otaku caricature, self-inserting himself into his fantasy world, looking for his perfect waifu."") This kinda furthers my point of the show starting out seemingly misogynistic, but turning completely against that premise.

#Other stuff

Art and animation is okay, nothing to write to home about though. The 3D mechs do their thing and don't disturb the general style; they're even color-coded for watching convenience. Even though there's some irks and reused cuts, the action is made well enough to turn a blind eye on the errors. Usually there is too much going on the screen to pay attenton to the details.

Music is well-done, and few pieces are even good enough to be listened to on its own. It is practically a given when Nana Mizuki (Symphogear) is in the cast. Definitely a noticeable part of the fun you'll be having with the show, with the high point being the [first OP](http://b.1339.cf/czjtltk.webm) and the [epic duo El Ragna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih5nEiOwFWk) - that one is made of two frequently recurring songs and honestly never gets old, especially considering the circumstances it's used at. The Vilkiss theme is pretty sweet as well.

What's also worth noticing are the secondary characters. The show manages a broad cast, most of it belonging to the group of mecha pilots, and they're, if not well-written, then at least engaging to observe. The character dynamics are a strong part of the series, and it's not just their interactions with MC - they have their own issues going for them on the side, which makes this flaming trainwreck that more picturesque. You'll most likely come to really like many of them, they're quite memorable, even if simplistic.

#Summary

Want to watch a show so insultingly ridiculous, the voice actors themselves will make fun of it after credits? Watch Cross Ange. It's a trainwreck that never stops rolling, and eventually you realize it now functions as a monorail.

I wrote that one without having played the expansion first (still waiting for that paycheck).

What is referenced, though, is the Polish equivalent of Faust - **Pan Twardowski**. The [legendary sorcerer](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Twardowski_z_diablem.jpg) lived supposedly in the 16th century and made a pact with the Devil, selling his soul in exchange for supernatural powers, but only until he visits Rome (which he obviously never intended to do. Supposedly he even appeared at the court of king Sigismund Augustus to summon the spirit of his dead wife, making him sort of a Rasputin figure.

The legend has numerous renditions, both in Polish literature and outside of it - there are Ukrainian and Russian novels, ballads and operas about the character, each with a different take on the story.

The most famous one is a comical poem by Adam Mickiewicz *Pani Twardowska* (Mrs. Twardowski), in which the Devil finds Mr. Twardowski in the inn called ""Rome"", therefore forcing the sorcerer to give up his soul. Twardowski reminds the devil of three trials he's entitled to request - and while the first two (seemingly impossible) tasks are fullfilled in a whim, the third one leaves the Devil helpless: Twardowski requests of the Devil to live for a year with his wife, the titular Pani Twardowska. The Devil after a quick assessment of the situation runs away and never comes back.

In other versions of the legend, Twardowski got captured by the Devil in the ""Rome"" inn, but while being carried away, recalled and recited a prayer, and the Devil, disgusted, dropped him off on the moon. [This](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/xR-SNuK5w6E/hqdefault.jpg) is the popular image of Pan Twardowski in the current culture.

By reading it you will get some context that will in *some* part be relevant to the contents of the expansion.

First things first, in case you haven't noticed it yet, The Witcher is throughly postmodernistic and PACKED with references to fairy tales, fantasy series and Polish folklore. Calling it ""easter eggs"" misses the point completely - both the books and the games don't just parody the stuff they're referencing, but polemicize with it, or even play it straight and treat as a canvas for its own story. That was the case with the story of two sisters in Act 4 of ""The Witcher"" game, and with the ""Tower of Mice"" quest in TW3. The former was based on a XIXth-century play by Juliusz Słowacki, which was by itself folklore-inspired work of Polish Romanticism, the latter is a legend about the foundations of Poland, in which an evil duke Popiel gets eaten by mice in his own tower, and the power goes to a common wheelwright Piast, whose name will later on start the first Polish dynasty of Piasts, which will rule Poland for half a millenium. Same goes for the Forefathers' Eve during/aside from Family Matters quest, which is straight copied from Mickewicz's play, in which the Peller calls restless spirits who can't find their way into the afterlife (it's basically Polish Haloween).

---

Now, here's what you need to know about **Wesele** (The Wedding). It's a play written by Stanisław Wyspiański, a painter and playwriter, on the brink of the XXth century. It's based on his own experience (an actual wedding reception he attended), but goes into supernatural and political territory. In this time, Poland has been partitioned between Prussia, Russia and Austria for just over 100 years, and the future of the Polish nation is under question. The transition from the feudal society into the industrialized, modern age is being carried by the occupants, and the Polish national identity is still tied to the old system and values. The nobility has declined, but there's still a huge gap between peasants and the city-dwelling intelligentsia.

#Act I

The play begins when the wedding has already started. The young couple comes from two different social circles - the groom is an educated man from the Kraków intelligentsia, and the bride is a peasant girl. Both sides have invited numerous guests, and we get to meet them all:

* The **Host** living in the country with peasants, but well-educated and originating from intelligentsia (painter, writer, activist)
* The **Journalist**, writing for a prominent newspaper in Kraków, he's sick of all the political crap and wants to chill out at the wedding. Asked by the peasants about news from China in the first scene, he starts complaining right away.
* The **Poet** is the host's brother living in the city, a decadent bored with the world, and looking for any opportunity to spice things up - be that seducing young girls from the city, word games with the other people from the city, or just casual drinking.
* **Rachela** is the village innkeeper's daughter, but being Jewish and well-educated she hangs around with the intelligentsia
* The **Councilwoman** is the groom's aunt, who clearly doesn't know anything about the life in the country, but tries smalltalk anyway
* The **Priest**, who despite belonging to the educated class, originated from peasantry (and currently can't advance within clergy due to his heritage)
* Other guests (townspeople, peasants), all based on actual people (some took their offence after seeing their caricatures in the play)

The party goes on as usual - drinking, flirting, dancing, arguing - revealing some small but significant cultural differences between the two groups. The groom treats his new life as something exciting, exotic, content with his new robes, while the bride is concerned about her appearance, refusing to take off shoes even though her feet are hurting. Some city girls flirt with the peasant boys, some peasant boys get it on with the peasant girls, and so on.

There is a problem when some of the guests get too drunk - in particular, one of the peasants gets into an argument with the innkeeper about debts, as the innkeeper needs money to pay the lease to the parish - and the demons of the past are threatening to awaken, as the bloody uprising of peasants against nobility and clergy is still in memory. But the party goes on.

That is until the Poet and Rachela decide that the party is not interesting enough, and come up with a fantastical idea to invite their ""imaginary friends"" - spirits, wraiths, symbols they just came up with. The Poet goes through with it and convinces the newlyweds to invite the [Chochoł](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VqlknOatBg8/T8dmR6ZmBOI/AAAAAAAABBU/RoFp4Kda4Ls/s1600/chocho%C5%82y.jpeg) (a straw-wrap for a rosebush-cane that's used to let roses survive winter). That concludes the act 1 and changes everything.

---

#Act II

is where things get surreal. **People at the wedding get visited by spirits of the past** (think Christmas Carol), who poke at their mistakes and call them to action.

* One of the peasants girls sees her deceased lover, a French painter (real-life character) with whom she was supposed to run away. This encounter is ""played straight"" without any subtext, and the spirit is vampire-like in nature.
* The Journalist sees [Stańczyk](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Matejko_Sta%C5%84czyk.jpg/1280px-Matejko_Sta%C5%84czyk.jpg), the famous clever fool from the XVIth century, who was a renowned and intelligent comic. Stańczyk calls to the Journalist's conscinence, as currently he works in accord with the Austrian occupant, forgetting - or even betraying - the Polish cause.
* The Poet sees [Zawisza Czarny](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Zawisza_Czarny_z_Garbowa.JPG/250px-Zawisza_Czarny_z_Garbowa.JPG), the legendary knight from the XIVth century, undefeated, educated and a skilled politician, representing Poland during political summits in Europe. Zawisza the Black appeals to his sense of wonder and awe, showing him that Poland can be a great thing worth believeing in.
* The groom sees the [hetman Branicki](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Jan_Klemens_Branicki.jpg), an infamous traitor impersonating all the worst things about Polish nobility: corruption, arrogance, disdain for the lower classes. He accuses the groom of being irresponsible and artificial with his fascination with the peasantry, and voices his contempt for betraying the noble lineage.
* One of the older peasants who remembers the bloody uprising against the local nobles and clergy from 1864 sees the wraith of the revolt's leader, who threatens with history repeating itself, and personifies the old peasant's remorse.
* Finally the Host gets a visit from [Wernyhora](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Matejko_Wernyhora.jpg), a legendary (not historical) bard, who orders the Host to call everyone to action and rise to fight for Poland with a golden horn he hands over.

But the Host is tired after the wedding reception, and gives the mission to one of the peasant boys, Jasiek. Jasiek gets on a horse and rides away to the borders, to signal the uprising to the other two parts of Poland (the Russian and the Prussian one).

#Act III

The Hangover - Polish edition.

It's the morning, and everyone is... well, as expected. Some people are still drunk or out cold. The Host doesn't remember a thing from last night, and some people argue if the story about Wernyhora's arrival is true at all. The Bride had a strange dream - she was being carried away by devils, and when asked where they're taking her, they've answered ""To Poland"" - but the Bride didn't know where that is, and asks the Poet. The Poet replies that it's not on map, but is in her heart.

With time, details from last night come together. The peasants are now sure that the spirits have visited the house, and the Host has remembered the call to action. Despite the reluctancy of some people from the intelligentsia (the Groom for example is careless and admires the nature, not taking the threats and concerns seriously) people are taking out the [scythes and sabres](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Stachowicz_Kosynierzy.jpg), and preparing for the uprising, waiting for the signal.

But the signal doesn't come. Jasiek comes back without the horn, having lost it on his way. He arrives only to find everyone standing still, as if hyptonized or asleep. He recalls that he must have lost the horn while leaning down to grab his [fancy hat with a peacock feather](http://img33.staticclassifieds.com/images_tablicapl/111219243_1_644x461_czapka-krakowiaka-pawie-piora-2-tarnow.jpg) that fell off his head, and since he failed even at that, all he has now is the horn's rope.

The Chochoł enters again. He orders Jasiek to take away the scythes and sabres, and begins to play his fiddle. As Chochoł plays, the guests start the creepy, lifeless dance, to his song:

&gt; Miałeś, chamie złoty róg,  
&gt; Miałeś, chamie czapkę z piór,  
&gt; Czapkę wicher niesie  
&gt; Róg huka po lesis  
&gt; Ostał ci się ino sznur

which translates roughly to ""boor you've had a golden horn, boor you've had a feathered cap, the cap's floating on the wind, the horn is sounding in the woods, all you're left with is the rope"".

---

All in all, Wesele is a drama about Poland's social structure and its inability to gain its own independence. Written in 1900, it came out 14 years before World War 1 broke out, weakening the occupants enough for Poland to reappear on map (not without issues, as the Greater Poland and Silesia had to conduct uprisings to join the eastern Poland, and then in 1920 the Bolsheviks tried to take it). Wesele is a must-read (literally) in Polish highschool, and as I've attended a theatre school, we've actually played it. Analyzing it is kinda enjoyable (no ""blue curtains"" bullshit), as the symbols of the Chochoł (hidden beauty, slumber) and the fancy hat (literally that, focusing on the common pleasures and forgetting the grand cause) are easy to read and clearly intended to be allegoric.

So now you know. This is probably absurdly overblown textwall of a background to have, but any time you find a little reference in Hearts of Stone, you may smile and think ""I've got that one"". And if there is no direct reference, you can still see the spirit of what the authors had in mind while writing the wedding part, next to all the possible Faust inspirations the rest of HoS will use.

#EDIT: Could you guys tell me if it's in any way relevant to Hearts of Stone?

35,2015-09-29 23:20:48+00:00,self.summonerschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/3mwb79/how_and_why_to_brand/,False,"There are few mages who have been seeing high winrates for quite a while despite being completely absent from competitive play. Malzahar and Lux are one thing, but right behind them it's Brand. He has never been picked in the history of the LCS, but he might very well appear at Worlds, and here's why.

^(also, just got back to Diamond spamming him, so I wanted to share my joy :])

#Brand's situation in the current meta

Brand has not changed his kit in years, besides a significant but important buff to his ult not fizzling when bouncing off invulnerable champions. Might seem like a straight out buff, but the sheer amount of champions with high mobility and invulnerability released after him makes it rather keeping up with the power creep.

Brand excels at dealing heavy AoE burst damage that turns into significant DoT afterwards. He's best against immobile targets and can shred the enemy frontline when building for DPS. His obscene synergy with Liandrylai allows him to turn into a control mage.

#Changes that led up to this moment

Brand's favourable position in the current metagame is a result of few changes:

* Buffs to Liandry's Torment and Rylai's Crystal Scepter
* Introduction of new health-stacking items (Sterak, DMP, Titanic Hydra)
* Popularity of health-stacking champions without gapclosers (juggernauts)

Let's make something clear: his ulti is still anything but reliable and many popular midlane champions, especially with mobility on demand, can ruin his day. In lane, Fizz is his worst nightmare, Ahri gives him a hard time post-6 and pre-6 can dodge most skillshots with the help of her Q speed boost, and Lux, even though she's not mobile herself, outranges him (so does Xerath). In and out of lane Yasuo can ruin Brand's Q and R with a good windwall, and so can Braum.

Brand is not a hidden OP, he has his flaws. Consider this is coming from a guy whose other mains are Quinn (top, mid, adc) and Sejuani (top (!), jungle). Nevertheless, in some situations, or with some particular bans, Brand is a pick worth considering.

#Team composition

Basically, you need two components in your team: heavy engage and cleanup crew. Brand is not a killer type of carry, but a DPS followup type. You want someone to hold down the enemy team for you to cast your stuff (it takes time!), and then you want someone to roll over them and pick up the kills.

For initiation, think season 2 style. Malphite, Leona, Amumu, Sejuani, Jarvan, Gnar - the harder the better. Just make sure you can follow them instantly. Alternatively, if your team has significant poke in the ADC position (or toplane is Jayce) Brand can work well in poke-disengage comps. In that case your role of melting the enemy frontline will be even more needed.

For cleanup, obvious choices are Tristana, Jinx and Vayne, but it doesn't have to be the ADC. Irelia, Khazix, Master Yi and any other Devourer jungler are just as good at the job. The likes of Irelia and Khazix come in handy when the enemy ADC needs to be bursted down: sometimes when the enemy ADC is fed you'll end up useless against them with your DPS build. That's when champs like Lee Sin or Irelia can shine, doing the work for you.

Also, bans: you ban Vayne (mostly because of her current state and competeing for your ecological niche of shredding tanks), Diana (again, OP at the moment) and Fizz/Yasuo/Fiora. You do NOT ban Garen or Darius, because you WANT the enemy team to pick them.

#Itemization

If I had a penny for every time I've heard ""report brand no deathcap""...

You do not want to build Deathcap on Brand. Ever. The only exception would be when you're snowballing so hard it doesn't matter, or the enemy team is stupid enough to never buy any MR and you can substitute it for the Void Staff... or maybe, maybe - if your team absolutely needs to annihilate the enemy in one wombo combo, and your DPS is not needed (e.g. zero health items on the enemy team). And even in these cases, Luden's might be better for burst damage.

* Your core is Liandrylai. This item combination is a power spike unlike any other. Everything your spells touch will be slowed for 4 seconds and lose half of its HP. It used to be quite underwhelming a year ago when it gave 800 HP and 130 AP, but now it's 700 HP and 180 AP. Big difference.
* In some cases you might want to rush Rylai's before Liandry's. Sometimes even go HG -&gt; (Morello if needed) -&gt; Rylai -&gt; Liandry. Postpone Liandry's Torment if the enemy team has no health items, you need the bigger health chunk from Rylai's, or you really need the slows. Otherwise, Liandry's is definitely worth rushing.
* You might want to get two Doran's Rings in the laning phase, or - if you can't manage with just the blue buff, or there's a need for Grievous Wounds - a Morellonomicon. Spamming spells with Liandrylai is great, but you'll run out of mana in no time.
* Not even Zed is a reason to rush Zhonya's. Liandrylai is already a huge chunk of HP. Yes, you'll want it in some cases, but as the first item, it's not a good choice. In the case of Zed, by the time you get your first big item, it should be just up for drake fights. And by then, if Zed ults you, it's all good. You drop your spells and your job is done, and Zed did not ult your ADC. Zhonya's is a good purchase as a 3rd/4th item if there's anything big it can prevent. Otherwise your cooldowns are too long to count on it getting you to the next iteration of spellcasts.
* Your next item after Liandrylai - save for late Morellonomicon and Zhonyas emergency - is Void Staff. Even if they don't buy any MR (true damage, yeah!).
* Abyssal Scepter is OK when you need MR and the enemy (be that tanks or assassins) jumps in your face. Consider this a possible alternative to VS if the enemy team has low MR (try to not build these two together, VS's % is calculated after Abyssal's flat reduction).
* Banner of Command is actually worth considering for securing 40% CDR, defending your team from enemy AoE (if you can afford it and your support can't), exerting splitpush pressure or countering enemy AP waveclear.
* You can sell Sorcerer's Shoes for Luden's Echo if everyone in the enemy team has MR and you're already wielding Void Staff. Otherwise, you're stacking as much MR as possible.
* There's one case when you want a Deathcap: it's the 6-items-lategame, your team lacks burst damage, and there's no pressure on you to build any survi items such as Zhonya's. In that case, yeah, it might be a good idea.

Also, upgrade your trinket ASAP. Makes your whole midgame presence that much better.

#Runes, masteries, skill order

21/0/9 masteries, magic penetration runes. I use the following setup:

* mpen marks
* armor seals
* 6 MR / 3 scaling CDR glyphs (gets to 5% at lvl 18, which sums up with 5% from masteries)
* 2 mpen quints, 1 MS quint (if you're better than me at mechanics get 3x mpen, if you're in a hard lane and want to roam like a champ get 3x MS)

You can also try flat health seals and 9 scaling CDR glyphs (gets you to 15%).

Skill order is R&gt;W&gt;Q&gt;E. You level up Q for better poke/burst/stun uptime (reduced cooldown, higher damage) and it stays at the same mana cost.

#Mechanics

I suck at mechanics. The only reason I ever got to Diamond was persistent theorycrafting and positive attitude (I'm good at getting carried and comebacks with good old fashioned AoE tanks, for example I spammed Sejuani top before Cinderhulk was a thing and she got her bans and nerfs). But here's what I can share:

* Your best case scenario is hitting the EQW combo. If you do it even once in the lane, it's a huge swing in your favour, so everyone will try to dodge it.
* If you can predict the enemy movement, you can drop WQ/QW to either stun them (works great when peeling a potential hard engage) or poke for huge QW damage (when you have Liandry's, the stun from Q will possibly get out more damage from the doubled burn, so maybe stick to WQ). One of the most satisfying things you can do as Brand is stunning LeBlanc in the location she dashes to as you predict it.
* There's a fancy combo where you cast Q, flash in and E the target before the Q lands, which results in the ""instant"" stun. You'll look like an idiot if the enemy dodges the Q anyway.
* Never R a single target unless you're securing a kill, or the other targets are too far to bother.
* Dropping your R on tanky dudes that won't bother to break it may be a better idea that trying hard to hit squishies who spread out and break it. Brand can peel beefy dudes off himself and his ADC like a true support (which is why he's actually quite successful in that role)
* Dropping your R during a stalemate (baron dance, tower siege when there's no creeps around) can bring devastating results and drop one or two people below 50% health.

#Game presence

You're not Karthus and your 6 items power is not the highest. But you're no LeBlanc either. Generally you don't need to snowball, just make sure you get your core items before the game ends.

Your lane is strong enough just with the EW spam to survive most matchups. Your skirmish capability post-6 is absurd. If the lane matchup is problematic, roam bot, cast ult, GG.

With Liandrylai on, you don't even need to care about your own survival. As long as you got to launch a fancy combo, your team should have no trouble winning 4v5. They're slowed, they're at 50% hp, and they've probably just used some important spells to get you. In that situation, you're pretty much a suicide bomber, launch-and-forget. Say to yourself ""allahu akbrand"" and enjoy the fireworks.

Look at the post-game stats. Your damage to enemy champions is INSANE, highest in the team in 90% cases, sometimes even 3 times higher than the other carries'.

#Conclusion

How to Brand? Build Liandrylai, melt juggernauts.

Why to Brand? Makes all the ""must-ban"" juggernauts cry, allows your ADC to live their dream, sets you up to getting carried by more capable teammates.",summonerschool,How (and why) to Brand,https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/3mwb79/how_and_why_to_brand/

[Final version of the flowchart](http://i.imgur.com/8gqYXqS.png) that will (hopefully) hit the press tomorrow. Please check for typos (you can also throw in some last-ditch suggestions but that risks in further typos).

Changelog:

* Angel Beats moved to the Feels section in the extended chart per popular complaint - it stays in the beginner section as it was, the two most popular baits are the ""Abandon Thread"" gif and the rocket chairs scene.

* The disclaimer of the SoL section now states that some of the ""feels"" series are not technically SoL (was already true for NHK, now even more apparent with Angel Beats!)

* Added D-Frag! (popular demand) and Ben-To! (had a cool idea for the green box and wanted to go along with it), also some sidenotes already made while the last thread was up

* The Kokoro Connect box has now ""(literally)"" added because that's what the series is after all. I could add a ""BEST GIRL WINS"" disclaimer under it, would it help? If you're still against ""Forced drama"", please suggest alternatives.

* Per another demand the ""Ready to turn off critical thinking?"" box has been changed to ""Ready for the guiltiest pleasure of your life?"". Is it better?

* The suggestion to include information about English dubs has been heard, but that's too much information in the beginner section, and too much visual clutter in the extended version. Also just because a dub exists doesn't mean it's good, and as a non-native speaker I'm incapable of judging if it's good or not for the people who seek English dubs.

Also, this is supposed to be the text block coming with the flowchart. Please proofread. Not just for typos, but for the infodump - what wasn't clear enough, what should be cut, etc.

&gt; #Design
&gt; 
&gt; The idea behind this flowchart was my habit of watching anime with alternating mood: something entertaining followed by something ambitious, and never two ""heavy"" series in a row. Since software development is what I study, I am more than familiar with the idea of flowcharts, and I made a quick sketch of two questions ""Do you want something ambitious?"" and ""Does it have to be good?"" (as there are many series that hook you with an interesting premise, but aren't all that satisfying in the end).
&gt; 
&gt; Originally, the flowchart was one giant monstrosity with the ""entertaining/ambitious"" sections branching endlessly. It got WAY more traction that I ever could have expected, climbing to top #1 /r/anime posts of all time - but once the thousands of comments rolled in, people started picking up the details I've missed, like mislabeled series, typos, inconsistency, imbalance between the blue and pink frame (before purple frame was a thing) the whole thing being too confusing with the long drops (arrows that go way too far down), etc.
&gt; 
&gt; That's why I've decided to give the thing a few public iterations and make something that I could publish and not feel embarassed about.
&gt; 
&gt; #Beginner section
&gt; 
&gt; The idea of using thumbnails came to me after my recommendation charts made in the meantime went viral on imgur and 9gag. This flowchart is extremely intimidating to a newcomer, so having an even more visual guide helps a lot, especially for people completely new to this.
&gt; 
&gt; I've made it with three groups of newcomers in mind: teenagers too young to remember DBZ or Sailor Moon airing, adults who grew up on the forementioned series, and folks who like the Studio Ghibli movies and want something similar. Examples of people in the groups: first is the class I teach, second is me, third is my sister. For all of them, series like FMA:B and Attack on Titan will be something interesting, but there are also some more precise shots, like Mushishi for the Ghibli crowd, Magi for the young Avatar fans and Toradora as the introduction to romance.
&gt; 
&gt; All three comedies are more than just that because the anime comedy antics are difficult to get used to (think how distracting was the overused chibi joke im FMA:B) and all these series have something else going on for them. Maou-sama and Angel Beats are straight out action comedies that should takje a grip on a newbie with just the action, and Toradora is an example of ""come for the comedy, stay for the drama"" that however imperfect (let's be real, some people will hate Taiga's abusiveness) can open up the whole comedy genre to many people. Alternative for Toradora here would be Nisekoi but come on I'm not that cruel.
&gt; 
&gt; All the series in the beginner section are attractive for both genders (Magi, Psycho-Pass and AoT are even considered ""fujobait"") because I did not want to make any excessive notes about demographics and series with overblown fanservice tend to be offputting anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; #Genres
&gt; 
&gt; Main problem of the old layout was bundling ""cute girls doing cute things"" under ""feels"", which were considered ""ambitious"". after breaking down ""entertaining/ambitious"" into Action, Comedy, Drama and Thriller, I've realized I need the fifth category for emotionally-focused series, under the Slice of Life flag. This division isn't perfect, but the main blocks are more or less the same size.
&gt; 
&gt; Action-adventure is bundled together because of the huge overlap in the demand, the demographics, and the designation of particular series into one of the two genres. It would be an uneasy task to split hybrid action-adventure series into one of the two categories, and using three branches (action, adventure, hybrid) seems like excessive compartmentalization. Pretty much all of the series in that category are action-packed, and the select few non-action adventure series have been moved to ""Slice of life"" (Mushishi, Spice &amp; Wolf). Differentiating between finished and unfinished action series is something that was needed because this is the worst offender in that regard. ""Anime as a LN advertisement"" is a plague, and that move allowed me to build a group that excluded many popular ongoing series.
&gt; 
&gt; The ""Pure Fun"" branch is a mix of action comedies and ""guilty pleasure"" series I've personally enjoyed in their entirety (plus JoJo). This category exists for two purposes: separating non-violent action comedies (NGNL, Shokugeki) from the rest and shwocasing a few ""guilty pleasure"" series that would otherwise raise questions - why are those next to critically acclaimed series, why were the better ones left out, why weren't similar/ecchi series included. I don't expect anyone to have the exact same taste as me, but there is no objective way to assess trainwrecks in their value, so I went full subjective on that one. Keep in mind the whole thing is tainted with my subjective opinion on what objectivity is :)
&gt; 
&gt; One big disservice this chart makes is to the sports genre. Aside of few romances (Cross Game, Touch) that have been placed in a more appropriate manner, all the other sports series are bundled together in a subbranch of ""Action"" even though many of them don't have any action whatsoever. I've gotta admit, this whole section is just made in consultation with people who are fans of the sports anime (folks over at IRC), because I haven't watched any. And even though it bacame apparent to me some goo dtime ago, it's an error that's been made far too early in the design phase to have an easy way to fix it.
&gt; 
&gt; Comedy is divided quite simply - ""normal"" work/school comedy, romance comedy and parodies. Having parodies in a separate category allowed for an all-branch disclaimer: ""you need to know what it's a parody of"". Why isn't romance a separate category? Mostly because popular romance series tend to be comedies or tragedies, and in some stories the romance doesn't necessarily drive the plot. I've decided then to use Comedy and Drama as main genres, and overall limit the number of main genres. So same goes for things like sci-fi, mecha, magical girls, sports. Byproduct of the design choice.
&gt; 
&gt; Drama is designed with adult audience in mind. This is by far the worst section when it comes to ""what the author of the chart watched"" ratio. Half of these is my PTW list - I'm a young adult and have lots of catching up to do. There are few designs choices I'll still stand by, which is bundling the groups of mindfuck sci-fi, ambitious romances, and Ikuhara shows.
&gt; 
&gt; Thrillers and horrors are self-explanatory. My only regret is not fitting in Millenium Actress and Paranoia Agent, but all fans of Satoshi Kon will find these anyway. Note that my favourite horror (Shinsekai yori) is in the Drama section.
&gt; 
&gt; #Choice of series
&gt; 
&gt; Why did I list so many new series and so little old series? Three reasons. First, the footnote at the very bottom says ""important"", not 'best"". Popular new series are important because they exist in the anime fandom's minds, cosplays, comments and gif reactions. This chart is meant to be a guide to the anime as it is at a very specific point in time. I expect it to outdate in a few years (unless I update it at least annually). Second - the ""Seinfeld is Unfunny"" syndrome. Some series have used or even invented the tropes that since then have been reused, recycled, mirrored, parodied and reforged to a point where the original seems repetitive and cliched to a newcomer. Third - the old (let's define old as 4:3 and new as 16:9) animation is often uneasy on the eyes of those who come with the expectations of something similar to Avatar, Batman and Teen Titans. Sure, old anime often has better production values, but times change and tastes change with them. We the '90s kids who grew up on DBZ, Sailor Moon and Pokemon are in out mid-20s now and the new generation, even though eager to hear what we have to say, doesn't necessarily see the appeal of what we enjoyed (source: I teach kids 10 years younger than me, some of which are getting into anime).
&gt; 
&gt; Sources of consultation: tons of internet comments, hours of browsing MAL and similar sites, /r/anime, /a/, folks over at Quakenet, my students, my friends, my sisters. You're all awesome.
&gt; 
&gt; #Publishing format
&gt; 
&gt; I chose to make it 1200 pixels wide (as opposed to the initial 1500) to make sure people can view it without scaling on HD displays without losing that much quality for the people with full HD. Mobile devices are fucked, anyway, i guess.
&gt; 
&gt; If you want better quality (printing, bigger displays, zooming in, searching by text), here you have it in SVG, PDF and HTML, for whoever needs it. I'm just giving you what draw.io provides.

Oh and about publishing format: is 1000 pixels okay? Should it be more, or less? What is the optimum between quality and filesize?

Changes since the [last version:](http://imgur.com/a/yyrny)

* remade the ""short version"" in a more visual format so that the absolute beginners don't get a panic attack looking at the gianormous extended version
* added few action series from underrepresented categories (martial arts, aerial combat, urban fantasy)
* added few sports series that people keep spamming in the comments
* changed the border color of Free to pink
* moved Soul Eater to the side without good conclusive end :&gt; (after news of what ""season 2"" of Shingeki no Bahamut is, I moved SnB Genesis to the side with conclusive end, and used the opportunity to swap it with Soul Eater)
* addeed Binbougami ga! and Humanity has Declined to parodies
* tons of side notes redirecting to similar series that didn't make it into the chart or are situated somewhere else
* jammed in Saint Oniisan because the ""with whom"" question had too much free space around the answers
* moved Planetes to separate category, it's not really a space opera (also: finally got to watch it and decided on orange seal of approval); moved GitS so that it's labeled properly; moved Kaiba to where it should be
* added Rec and School Days (because of reasons)
* expanded the list of thrillers (Gankutsuou, Rainbow, Eden of the East)

* Split the extended flowchart into 5 main genres to remove the absurdly long drops (arrows going down so long you can't see both boxes it connects on one screen).

* **Third frame color - purple.** I've figured it would be informative to distinguish shoujo/josei shows from shounens with huge female fandom. It's not like Utena isn't a good show for guys as well, but there is a huge difference between the interest in Free! or Magi and the interest in shoujo romcoms. Just like girls can stay away from ""blue"" shows, boys can filter the ""pink"" ones away.

* **New feature: side notes.** At first introduced to fill some blank space, but can be also used for important notes that should be attached to the chart (such as: parodies are bad for beginners, explaining what the 3 main branches are, watch order, singling out shows with unusual animation, etc.)

 * Nasuverse watch order: Fate/zero stays as the lesser of two evils. Yeah it spoils the hell out of Heaven's Feel, but starting with UBW is not a good idea, either. Added a note ""Play the VN"", because that's the only good start. 
 * Raildex watch order: Railgun serves as a better introduction to the Academy City and a better depiction of the Sisters Arc. Yeah, over half of it is mediocre filler, and my personal bias against Index (the character) is showing, but it stays. I've included a separate entry to Index as an indicator that people can start there as well.
 * Gundam - the note literally says ""start with 00 or SEED"", as these two are the most popular starting points.

* Slice of Life is now a main genre and holds all the melodramas (""feels"") and the road trip shows. Also the ""chillout"" stuff such as Hyouka, Tamako Market or K-On!.

* Ikuhara's shows (Utena, Penguindrum) prompted me to divide the ""ambitious"" branch in a different manner. Horrors are one subbranch, thrillers are the second one - and ""Drama"", now without the moe and melodrama, is reserved for serious stuff like hard sci fi, non-comedic romance and psychological shows.

* Expanded Thrillers (moved Fate there) and added Horrors (moved Hellsing Ultimate and Parasyte there). They're both a single ""big genre"", mostly to highlight Monster belonging to both (also, because on their own they're not big enough).

* Expanded the whole recommendation base as much as the space allowed for.

* All of your previous suggestions have been read and implemented, ignored or forgotten.

* There's an interactive version of the tool as well (website under construction). I'll update you guys once we have something to show.

Thanks for all your feedback, and hopefully together we'll create something we can automatically link to in all request threads! :) If the revised flowchart gains traction, I plan to delete the old one. General question would be: is the flowchart ready to be published, or do I need to fix something?

The flowchart gained WAY more popularity than I expected it to (it's in top 10 posts on /r/anime of all time, and started [circulating at 2chan and Japanese blogs with a Japanese translation](http://yaraon-blog.com/archives/65813)), but it's far from perfect. Not even recommendations that should have made it there - there were some obvious mistakes in it that needed to get fixed, and updating recommendations is just something extra.

However, as the chart grows, so does my disconnection with the whole thing. I'm by no means an expert, and at this moment I haven't even seen half of the shows I'm recommending. That's why **I need your help.** [Here's the WIP version of the chart](http://i.imgur.com/gNr4GGm.png). Main changes:

* Changed the layout to stretch the whole thing sideways and reduce the amount of ""long drops"" (arrows that go far down). **UPDATE: Discarded.** That version was ruled out in the last week's thread as overwhelming. [Link to the old stretched version](https://i.imgur.com/r1dBVAd.png)

 * the true ""for beginners"" mini-chart
 * the extended ""exhaustive"" chart

* Split the extended flowchart into main genres to remove the absurdly long drops (arrows going down so long you can't see both boxes it connects on one screen).

* **Third frame color - purple.** I've figured it would be informative to distinguish shoujo/josei shows from shounens with huge female fandom.

* **New tested feature: side notes.** At first introduced to fill some blank space, but can be also used for important notes that should be attached to the chart (such as: parodies are bad for beginners, explaining what the 3 main branches are, watch order, etc.)

* Fate moved to Thrillers. It's got this Hunger Games vibe and this way we'll have all main Urobuchi's shows (Fate, Psycho-Pass, Madoka) in one big branch. I also moved GitS there.

* **Introduced Horrors** and moved Hellsing and Parasyte there. I'm not that familiar with the genre (seen these two and Amnesia), but some people dig it as a whole.

* Ikuhara's shows (Utena, Penguindrum) prompted me to divide the ""ambitious"" branch in a different manner. Horrors are one subbranch, thrillers are the second one - and ""Drama"", now without the moe and melodrama, is reserved for serious stuff like hard sci fi, non-comedic romance and psychological shows.

* Drama holds now the romances that lean towards seriousness rather than comedy. I haven't seen half of the romances I've listed, so I need your help in filtering these.

* Expanded the whole recommendation base, with main entries:
 * Action/adventure (Finished): Black Lagoon, Trigun, Katanagatari, Rurouni Kenshin, Soul Eater, Full Metal Panic, Shakugan no Shana, 12 Kingdoms, Nanoha, Gungrave, Wolf's Rain. Shitload of shows, but all have their fans.
 * Action/adventure (Not finished): Noragami, Ao no Exorcist, Mahouka, moved here Little Witch Academia and Knights of Sidonia. I don't know if .hack counts as finished, and this version had no space for it next to SAO and LH (I can still place it in the finished action shows section). Also, I don't really know what Nantsu no Tanzai was about, but it seems to have been well-received.
 * Guilty pleasures: added DxD (and then removed it) and JoJo as some of the famous shows, and then added Cross Ange because why the fuck not (Valvrave might be a better WTF example, but I haven't seen it, and with xAnge I can at least vouch for it being fun).
 * Expanded the romcom list a lot, including some famous comedies I kinda looked down upon in the last release (Chuunibyou, OreImo - I thought about Kiss x Sis, but it doesn't even pretend to have any story), and some stuff I probably should have thought of in the first place (Amagami SS, Maison Ikkou). Also, tons of shoujos.
 * Comedy section - SZS, Cromartie, moved Kokoro Connect to romcoms, added Witch Craft Works as really similar in its tone to Yamada (they differ in their cast, premise and genre, but the way they do what they set out to do is pretty much the same flavour).
 * Slice of life - Tamako Market, Aikatsu, Hyouka, Kyoukai no Kanata, Beck, Non Non Byori, Girls und Panzer, Bakuman - and Hibike! Euphorium, because there was some space to fill
 * Moved the ""feels"" section to Slice of Life. Added a few entries (Watamote, NHK, Natsume's Book of Friends).
 * Moved the ""road trip"" section from Drama to SoL. Added Kino's Journey.
 * Forementioned expansion of Drama section (psychological shows, romance dramas)

* All of your previous suggestions have been read and implemented, ignored or forgotten.
 * I need someone to explain Inuyasha to me. It keeps getting mentioned, but I don't see where it would fit.
 * Same goes for Denpa Teki Na Kanojo and Eden of the East.
 * WIXOSS - there is no container for ""cute girls suffering"", and I didn't have any idea or place to put it.
 * Other shows I didn't include in the chart either eveded my perception or got labeled in my brain as ""literally who?"".

Please help me polish this chart by answering the following questions:

1. Is the beginner section good?
1. Are the main genres understandable and thematically coherent?
1. Are all shows correctly labeled so far? (green boxes, frames, ""it gets better later on"" outlines)
1. What shows should be swapped/moved?
1. What shows to add? (especially in the empty spaces)
1. What shows to remove?
1. Am I justified to keep Bleach and Akame ga Kill out of this chart despite their popularity? (especially considering what other stuff got through) My justification is that the fantasy action adventure section is sated (it's the biggest block as it is).
1. Do some of the shows I've placed/haven't placed yet count as ""Feels""? This sort of stuff usually builds up over the whole story, so I can't really judge it by summaries or snapshots.
1. In general, what shows should get the ""for beginners"" mark?
1. Romances - which one are romance comedies, which ones go to where White Album 2 and Bakemonogatari are? (I want to divide between comedies and dramas) I haven't watched any of these (or dropped too soon to get a clear picture).
1. Readability of the chart - how bad is it? Should I use colored backgrounds for genres or something like that to improve it?

[Here's the WIP version of the chart](http://i.imgur.com/r1dBVAd.png). Main changes:

* Changed the layout to stretch the whole thing sideways and reduce the amount of ""long drops"" (arrows that go far down). There are still some for obvious reasons, but generally genres and subgenres should be contained within ""blocks"".

* Introduced third main branch ""Something calm"" for slice-of-life shows that aren't as intensive as the usual comedies (K-On! is the benchmark here for comedy, AnoHana for drama). This way we don't have K-On! labeled as ""Ambitious"" or ""Drama"". This branch will be also used for road trip shows like Spice&amp;Wolf and mystery shows like Hyouka.
 * Pinned down melodrama to the ""calm"" section. Added Usagi Drop.
 * Added ""Cringe"" section with NHK and Watamote.

* Third frame color - purple. I've figured it would be informative to distinguish shoujo/josei shows from shounens with huge female fandom.

Just like girls can stay away from ""blue"" shows, guys can filter the ""pink"" ones away.

* Orange rectangle means now ""beginner friendly"". Personal recommendations changed to rounded rectangle. This allows the beginners to quickly find some starting points in this mess. Is it visible enough, or should I change it to some even more standing out color?

* New tested feature: side notes. At first introduced to fill some blank space, but can be also used for important notes that should be attached to the chart (such as: parodies are bad for beginners, explaining what the 3 main branches are, watch order, etc.)

* Fate moved to Thrillers. It's got this Hunger Games vibe and this way we'll have all main Urobuchi's shows (Fate, Psycho-Pass, Madoka) in one big branch. I also moved Zetsuen no Tempest and GitS somewhere to the right side.

* Introduced Horrors and moved Hellsing and Parasyte there. I'm not that familiar with the genre (seen these two and Amnesia), but some people dig it as a whole. Shinsekai yori is technically in that genre, but I'm not sure if it fits with the others. I guess it can still be moved there.

* Ikuhara's shows prompted me to divide the ""ambitious"" branch in a different manner. Horrors are one subbranch, thrillers are the second one - and ""Drama"", now without the moe and melodrama, is reserved for serious stuff like hard sci fi and psychological thrillers. Yeah ""Thriller"" does not lead into all psychological thrillers now, but overall the leadup to Utena and Madoka is quite solid and understandable.

* Drama holds now the romances that lean towards drama rather than comedy. I haven't seen half of the romcoms I've listed, so I need your help in filtering these. As I write this, I already see Nagi no Asukara is the prime candidate for a relocation to Drama.

* Expanded the whole recommendation base, with main entries:
 * Action/adventure (Finished): Black Lagoon, Trigun, Katanagatari, Rurouni Kenshin, Soul Eater, Full Metal Panic
 * Action/adventure (Not finished): Noragami, Ao no Exorcist, Mahouka, moved here Little Witch Academia and Knights of Sidonia. I also added .hack, but I have no idea if it's finished or not. Also, I don't really know what Nantsu no Tanzai was about,  but it seems to have been well-received.

 * Comedy section - SZS, Cromartie
 * Slice of life - Tamako Market, Aikatsu, Hyouka, Kyoukai no Kanata, Beck, Non Non Byori, Girls und Panzer, Gakkou Gurashi (just about the only exception to the rule of not adding any new airing shows - this one just fits the grid :P )
* Side effect of the new layout will be losing some two-way entries, such as approaching Lucky Star from both Parody and Moe sides, or having Yuuki Yuuna as both PTSD Moe and a followup to Madoka.

While lurking in the /a/byss of the Internet, I've encountered [this image](http://i.imgur.com/533HJ6l.png) in a ""What I watched - What I expected - What I got"" thread. That peaked my interest. So this show, you say, appears to be bad, but it somehow rolls on?

Hell yeah. That's what **Symphogear** does.

* **Genre:** Action, Music, Sci-Fi
* **Type:** Original show, 13 episodes + 13 episodes + upcoming 3rd season
* **Similar to:** Cross Ange, Kill la Kill, Tengen Toppa Gurenn Lagann, Macross combined with Nanoha
* **MAL:** [first season](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11751/Senki_Zesshou_Symphogear:_Meteoroid-Falling_Burning_and_Disappear_Then...), [second season](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15793/Senki_Zesshou_Symphogear_G:_In_the_Distance_That_Day_When_the_Star_Became_Music...)

#Premise

In a somewhat futuristic world, a happy-go-lucky middle school student named Hibiki Tachibana attends a concert of a pop band ZweiWing. The event gets interrupted by what appears to be an alien invasion... that is fought off and repelled by the pair of lead singers themselves, using Symphogear - quasi-magical weaponized armor powered by songs. However, one of the idols ends up sacrificing herself to protect Hibiki, who got critically wounded and couldn't escape.

Two years later, Hibiki is living a normal school life, but the alien invaders are back. The remaining singer from ZweiWing is still fighting, but cannot save Hibiki in time. Pinned to a wall, Hibiki recalls a song that her saviour sang two years ago...

As TVTropes sum it up, ""Symphogear is a sci-fi series about Magical Girl Warriors who use Power Armor fueled by The Power of Rock to battle Eldritch Abominations. Yes, seriously.""

#What is so bad about it?

The whole ""we don't really write a good plot, and we don't think it matters"" attitude. The guys writing it had zero previous experience with anime and it shows - the plot is raw, unrefined and very much unpolished. It takes three episodes to even realize what kind of show are you watching, since the first two detour onto very different and conflicting themes - is it grimdark? is it slice of life? is it action? drama? what the hell?

References to Western culture are on the level of Andou from Inou-Battle: names like ""Gungnir"", ""Staff of Solomon"", ""Chris"" or ""Maria"" are just there to look cool, as it's a mythological kitchen sink. And that's not really that uncommon (NGE anyone?). You'll get a sensible chuckle out of the show's Engrish ""subtitles"": 

* Season 1: *Meteoroid-falling, burning, and disappear, then...*
* Season 2: *In the distance, that day, when the star became music...*
* Season 3: *Believe in justice and hold a determination to fist.*

You're also in trouble if you're [sensitive about yuri](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/678/979/667.jpg). It's not in the foreground and there are no sexual interactions between characters, but ALL girls in this show are involved in every other form of same-sex relationship. They're basically (almost) all paired up with each other. ""Friendship"", ""rivalry"" and (implied) ""romance"" are interchangeable here. But hey, for some people it might actually be a good thing. And there's no ""typical"" fanservice.

To sum up the bad points - if you got through the first three episodes, you will love the rest.

#What is so good about it?

Music. If you like j-pop, if you don't like j-pop, if you don't really know what j-pop is - check it out. Probably the only reason why this show got a second (and now a third) season is that the CDs with soundtrack sold like hotcakes, even better than the DVDs. The songs are great and convey the emotions of the characters - hot-blooded action, more hot-blooded action, but also a desperate ""swan song"" (an alternative translation for ""Final Song"").

And that wasn't really the only good thing about it. Once the show stabilized, the action was juicy, vivid and, what's most important, fun. The multi-track drifting is very strong with this one and I dare say that in the end, the plot actually made sense and didn't feel that bad (which I attribute to an overall solid villain in season 1).

The whole ""exceeds expectations"" thing caused the animation budget for the second season to get exponentially increased. The quality on every level - except for writing, since it's still the same people - [went up through the roof](http://i.imgur.com/lPxwGhv.png), and the positive reception caused the producers to announce the third season right away (it's airing this summer!).

#Can I start watching once season 3 airs?

Not really, no. This show has plot and character development that can't really be skipped, otherwise already shaky plot will become barely understandable. Even though the show has improved over time, it doesn't mean the first season was bad or anything.

#Similarities

Easiest example is Cross Ange, where we have not only the theme of ""singing is magic"", but it's noone else than Nana Mizuki herself (Ange/Tsubasa) performing in both shows. There's also this complete and consequential disregard of common sense, even though Symphogear isn't nearly as crazy as Cross Ange.

Kill la Kill's magical uniforms are somewhat close to Symphogear, but the main similarity is the ingredient also found in TTGL - over-the-top action, with no limits whatsoever. TTGL bears resemblance to Symphogear in the themes used in character development, namely grief and overcoming it, and also the sibling-esque relationship between the protagonist and their mentor.

#Summary

Do you hate fun? If not, then come get some. Symphogear is a hot-blooded-magical-girls-powering-up-through-battle-songs show that knows no subtlety nor sophistication. If you can shut off your brain, sit back and enjoy the ride. If you need one more push, check out the [first opening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOXaWCRv_68), even though it doesn't perfectly embody everything the show is about. You have a few days before season 3 airs - should be enough to binge watch the whole thing.

**TL;DR:** A show that goes so ham most Abrahamic religions will ban it.",anime,[WT!] Senki Zesshou Symphogear,http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3bnwes/wt_senki_zesshou_symphogear/
