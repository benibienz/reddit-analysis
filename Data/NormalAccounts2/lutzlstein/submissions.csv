Should I withdraw my retirement savings and take the hit of tax and early withdraw fees to pay the CC off and as many of the student loans as I can? Can I even make this withdraw?

I started a corporate job about 4 years ago, and have been contributing a bit over the minimum to get the full match from my employer. So far, I have just over $14k in my Fidelity Investments ($12k vested). Recently, I've been noticing how futile my student loan payments have been. Of over $500 in monthly payments, I am paying a couple hundred in interest.

My current repayment schedule has me being paid off by the time I'm dead (as far as I am concerned) – Mint estimates that it will take over 50 years. I'm 30 years old.

My credit score is too low to take on any other debt, but I have had all sorts of hair-brained schemes run thru my head. Things like taking out a home loan to pay off my student debt, then declaring bankruptcy so I can get a restart before I'm 80. I doubt that is even possible, but it's the kind of desperate thinking I've settled into at this point.

I've heard that withdrawing early from retirement is unwise, but with all the debt stacked against me, I don't know if that wisdom really applies. I'm not trying to buy a jetski with my 401k, after all – I'm trying to pay a significant chunk of my student loans down, and completely pay off my credit card (which has a 25% APR). 

I'm currently under the assumption that I would be paying 20% in taxes + 10% early withdraw fee on the 401k/Roth. (I don't know how to figure out what I have in each, separately. But I assume the taxes would be different on the Roth since it's post-tax.) So taking the 30% away from my savings, it would leave me with nearly $10k. 

Is this a good idea? Bad idea? Impossible idea?

Who should she contact to straighten all this out? She's willing to go to court for the ticket, they just neglected to send the paperwork with the date.",baltimore,"Advice, please!
