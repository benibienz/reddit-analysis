So I am upset because I went to a clothing store with a friend. She was trying on some clothes..and of course, nothing in my size (i'm 5'2"" 165 lbs. and size 16-18 US). I havent been bothered by the lack of clothes my size for a while. While waiting for my friend to finish trying on clothes, I saw the employees look at me like they knew I wasnt going to buy anything. What an awful trip.

By some miracle he responded to me last night on fb. I didnt give him an ultimatum at that time, but I told him how I dont appreciate what he is doing, and if he really cared about me anymore. He responded and told me that he had been in town for the past couple of weeks (he lives 30 min. from a city, he lives in a village) and that he had only came home to sleep. I asked what he was doing all this time in town, and he said he had been getting his Uni registration squared away and was looking for work. He also explained that his phone doesn't really work anymore, something is wrong with the keypad. Which makes sense when he has told me in the past that he cant respond to kik because of phone issues, and why he responded to me on fb.

He apologized for his absence, which I appreciated instead of making excuses. He said he loves me and isn't going anywhere. Of course what he has said could be up to interpretation, but he was remorseful for his absence,as he knew I was crying over it. When I told him how upset I was, I appreciated him just apologizing instead of saying something like ""i dont get on the internet much"".  We left the conversation not angry, which I was happy about.
