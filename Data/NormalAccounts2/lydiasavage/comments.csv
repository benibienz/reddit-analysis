1,Good guy. I won $750 dollars and plan to buy an s7 and a case. What you're doing is great :),2016-05-24 15:46:12+00:00,d3htezf,1.0,t3_4ksidh,32834.0,GalaxyS7

3,"Boot loop and some software issues with the G4, I believe. The camera on the G4 is better than the 5X in my opinion. It also includes a removable battery, expandable storage, and more RAM. The 5X includes updates from google the day they come out, though, and a better android experience. I owned a G3 and that phone was great, except after a couple of years it started to stutter and lag, and the battery went bad. But since the G4 is an improvement, I would suggest that phone over the 5X.",2016-04-03 23:37:55+00:00,d1onnp1,3.0,t1_d1on8lt,608.0,PickAnAndroidForMe

7,"This happened to me. Snapchat fucked me, opened it up one day, camera attempted to activate, got stuck in bootloop, attempted to fix it, and eventually it just died. Nothing. No life. Two weeks later, it tried turning on. Tried a new battery, it didn't work. It's dead again. Sigh. It's been months and I have officially ran out of hope.",2016-04-02 18:42:43+00:00,d1n832u,1.0,t3_4cwsy8,91304.0,LGG3
8,"I worked as a floor attendant at a local gym, kind of laid back, I liked that. I knew someone who was leaving the place and was sure to apply there (without them knowing of course, I couldn't be labeled as a replacement). I liked the people, all of them were interesting. I enjoyed seeing the people come and lose weight and get in shape over time. The cleaning and maintenance part of the job wasn't the greatest. Those protein shakes and long runs didn't make for fun times in the bathroom. ",2016-03-01 20:15:44+00:00,d0jriyx,1.0,t3_48hz7y,4979.0,CasualConversation

20,"Mine is doing the same thing, I haven't gotten a new battery yet and my phone seems bricked but after not messing with it for awhile the screen comes on for a few seconds. A good battery is needed to charge the mechanic that actually turns on your phone (the thing that tells you your battery is on 0%) and I figured that all of my messing with the phone and trying to turn it on drained that certain mechanic. I'm fairly certain a new battery will solve the problem. ",2016-01-22 19:13:21+00:00,cz82zhk,1.0,t3_426mgk,5407.0,LGG3
