Nexus 6P

Galaxy S7

Or Galaxy S7 edge

After a few more days of consideration. But now I am wondering, are there going to be better phones coming out soon? Should I just purchase an older phone (such as a G2) for the time being, or will it be a waste of my money? Any information or opinions are appreciated.

A bootloop transformed into a hard bricked phone. No signs of life. Sigh. I have now saved up money for a new phone ($750) and am having a hard time choosing. I have the Nexus 6P in my sights, but the size just seems like it could be an issue for my somewhat little girl hands. The S7 edge looks awful spiffy, but the price is what is turning me away. Sure, I have the money, but no one ever wants to spend all of it. I was loving the G5 at first, but then the more I stared at its design, the more I determined that it was so, so ugly. Any suggestions for me? I am looking for a great camera, great battery, and a lag free experience. (That seems to be the norm these days, which is why I need help.) Also, one thing I didn't like about my G3 was the display. It seemed very washed out compared to the AMOLED displays of other phones. Which is why I ruled out the V10, along with wanting to try something new.

It always starts back up and acts like nothing ever happened so I don't think much of it. A couple of days ago when the phone shut off, it got stuck in a boot loop. I tried powering off then back on, and it was still in the loop. Eventually the phone was just completely dead, wouldn't even consider powering on or telling me the battery is dead... I tried charging and nothing happened. No LED. Tried resetting, tried pretty much everything. I got tired and went to bed, the next day it still didn't work. Hours later I tried turning it on again and I got the logo again, but then it proceeded to die. Yay. Now it still seems bricked. I've tried almost anything. Does anyone have a solution?


UPDATE: new battery arrived, and it was not a fix. Very disappointed.",LGG3,"Umm, my phone may be bricked.",https://www.reddit.com/r/LGG3/comments/420784/umm_my_phone_may_be_bricked/
