Plug your RCA to aux converter in, then snake the aux cable underneath the hazard light switch. 

With the long horizontal grey bit of trim, you are going to want to grind down a small hold underneath it, just to the lower right of the cutout for the hazard light switch. You can grind it down with a file to be just big enough to pass the aux cable through. 

Assemble everything back and you'll be good to go. I have no pics at the moment but I'll try take some next time I'm at my car. I recommend a long RCA aux adapter, or an extension cord.

&gt;Late to the party but this one is too good to pass up:

&gt;I was once on a US military ship, having breakfast in the wardroom (officers lounge) when the Operations Officer (OPS) walks in.  This guy was the definition of NOT a morning person; he's still half asleep, bleary eyed... basically a zombie with a bagel.  He sits down across from me to eat his bagel and is just barely conscious.  My back is to the outboard side of the ship, and the morning sun is blazing in one of the portholes putting a big bright-ass circle of light right on his barely conscious face.  He's squinting and chewing and basically just remembering how to be alive for today.  It's painful to watch.

&gt;But then zombie-OPS stops chewing, slowly picks up the phone, and dials the bridge.  In his well-known I'm-still-totally-asleep voice, he says ""heeeey.  It's OPS.  Could you... shift our barpat... yeah, one six five.  Thanks."" And puts the phone down.  And then he just sits there.  Squinting.  Waiting.
  
&gt;And then, ever so slowly, I realize that that big blazing spot of sun has begun to slide off the zombie's face and onto the wall behind him.  After a moment it clears his face and he blinks slowly a few times and the brilliant beauty of what I've just witnessed begins to overwhelm me.  By ordering the bridge to adjust the ship's back-and-forth patrol by about 15 degrees, he's changed our course just enough to reposition the sun off of his face.  He's literally just redirected thousands of tons of steel and hundreds of people so that he could get the sun out of his eyes while he eats his bagel.  I am in awe.  

&gt;He slowly picks up his bagel and for a moment I'm terrified at the thought that his own genius may escape him, that he may never appreciate the epic brilliance of his laziness (since he's not going to wake up for another hour).  But between his next bites he pauses, looks at me, and gives me the faintest, sly grin, before returning to gnaw slowly on his zombie bagel.",2016-06-03 04:22:54+00:00,d3u2vq2,1.0,t3_4mawfz,4943.0,AskReddit

[Swamps of Dagobah] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xo41d/doctorsnursesredditors_what_has_been_your_most/c5o66p2)

OR Nurse here.  This is kind of a long one...

I was taking call one night, and woke up at two in the morning for a ""general surgery"" call.  Pretty vague, but at the time, I lived in a town that had large populations of young military guys and avid meth users, so late-night emergencies were common.

Got to the hospital, where a few more details awaited me -- ""Perirectal abscess.""  For the uninitiated, this means that somewhere in the immediate vicinity of the asshole, there was a pocket of pus that needed draining.  Needless to say our entire crew was less than thrilled.

I went down to the Emergency Room to transport the patient, and the only thing the ER nurse said as she handed me the chart was ""Have fun with this one."" Amongst healthcare professionals, vague statements like that are a bad sign. 

My patient was a 314lb Native American woman who barely fit on the stretcher I was transporting her on. She was rolling frantically side to side and moaning in pain, pulling at her clothes and muttering Hail Mary's.  I could barely get her name out of her after a few minutes of questioning, so after I confirmed her identity and what we were working on, I figured it was best just to get her to the anesthesiologist so we could knock her out and get this circus started.  

She continued her theatrics the entire ten-minute ride to the O.R., nearly falling off the surgical table as we were trying to put her under anesthetic.  We see patients like this a lot, though, chronic drug abusers who don't handle pain well and who have used so many drugs that even increased levels of pain medication don't touch simply because of high tolerance levels.  

It should be noted, tonight's surgical team was not exactly wet behind the ears.  I'd been working in healthcare for several years already, mostly psych and medical settings.  I've watched an 88-year-old man tear a 1""-diameter catheter balloon out of his penis while screaming ""You'll never make me talk!"".  I've been attacked by an HIV-positive neo-Nazi.  I've seen some shit.  The other nurse had been in the OR as a trauma specialist for over ten years; the anesthesiologist had done residency at a Level 1 trauma center, or as we call them, ""Knife and Gun Clubs"".  The surgeon was ex-Army, and averaged about eight words and two facial expressions a week.  None of us expected what was about to happen next.

We got the lady off to sleep, put her into the stirrups, and I began washing off the rectal area.  It was red and inflamed, a little bit of pus was seeping through, but it was all pretty standard. Her chart had noted that she'd been injecting IV drugs through her perineum, so this was obviously an infection from dirty needles or bad drugs, but overall, it didn't seem to warrant her repeated cries of ""Oh Jesus, kill me now.""

The surgeon steps up with a scalpel, sinks just the tip in, and at the exact same moment, the patient had a muscle twitch in her diaphragm, and just like that, all hell broke loose. 

Unbeknownst to us, the infection had actually tunneled nearly a foot into her abdomen, creating a vast cavern full of pus, rotten tissue, and fecal matter that had seeped outside of her colon.  This godforsaken mixture came rocketing out of that little incision like we were recreating the funeral scene from Jane Austen's ""Mafia!"".  

We all wear waterproof gowns, face masks, gloves, hats, the works -- all of which were as helpful was rainboots against a firehose.  The bed was in the middle of the room, an easy seven feet from the nearest wall, but by the time we were done, I was still finding bits of rotten flesh pasted against the back wall.  As the surgeon continued to advance his blade, the torrent just continued.  The patient kept seizing against the ventilator (not uncommon in surgery), and with every muscle contraction, she shot more of this brackish gray-brown fluid out onto the floor until, within minutes, it was seeping into the other nurse's shoes. 

I was nearly twelve feet away, jaw dropped open within my surgical mask, watching the second nurse dry-heaving and the surgeon standing on tip-toes to keep this stuff from soaking his socks any further. The smell hit them first. ""Oh god, I just threw up in my mask!""  The other nurse was out, she tore off her mask and sprinted out of the room, shoulders still heaving.   Then it hit me, mouth still wide open, not able to believe the volume of fluid this woman's body contained.  It was like getting a great big bite of the despair and apathy that permeated this woman's life.  I couldn't fucking breath, my lungs simply refused to pull anymore of that stuff in.  The anesthesiologist went down next, an ex-NCAA D1 tailback, his six-foot-two frame shaking as he threw open the door to the OR suite in an attempt to get more air in, letting me glimpse the second nurse still throwing up in the sinks outside the door.  Another geyser of pus splashed across the front of the surgeon.  The YouTube clip of ""David at the dentist"" keeps playing in my head -- ""Is this real life?""

In all operating rooms, everywhere in the world, regardless of socialized or privatized, secular or religious, big or small, there is one thing the same:  Somewhere, there is a bottle of peppermint concentrate.  Everyone in the department knows where it is, everyone knows what it is for, and everyone prays to their gods they never have to use it.  In times like this, we rub it on the inside of our masks to keep the outside smells at bay long enough to finish the procedure and shower off.

I sprinted to the our central supply, ripping open the drawer where this vial of ambrosia was kept, and was greeted by -- an empty fucking box.  The bottle had been emptied and not replaced.  Somewhere out there was a godless bastard who had used the last of the peppermint oil, and not replaced a single fucking drop of it.  To this day, if I figure out who it was, I'll kill them with my bare hands, but not before cramming their head up the colon of every last meth user I can find, just so we're even.

I darted back into the room with the next best thing I can find -- a vial of Mastisol, which is an adhesive rub we use sometimes for bandaging.  It's not as good as peppermint, but considering that over one-third of the floor was now thoroughly coated in what could easily be mistaken for a combination of bovine after-birth and maple syrup, we were out of options.  

I started rubbing as much of the Mastisol as I could get on the inside of my mask, just glad to be smelling anything except whatever slimy demon spawn we'd just cut out of this woman.  The anesthesiologist grabbed the vial next, dowsing the front of his mask in it so he could stand next to his machines long enough to make sure this woman didn't die on the table.  It wasn't until later that we realized that Mastisol can give you a mild high from huffing it like this, but in retrospect, that's probably what got us through.  

By this time, the smell had permeated out of our OR suite, and down the forty-foot hallway to the front desk, where the other nurse still sat, eyes bloodshot and watery, clenching her stomach desperately.  Our suite looked like the underground river of ooze from Ghostbusters II, except dirty.  Oh so dirty.

I stepped back into the OR suite, not wanting to leave the surgeon by himself in case he genuinely needed help.  It was like one of those overly-artistic representations of a zombie apocalypse you see on fan-forums.  Here's this one guy, in blue surgical garb, standing nearly ankle deep in lumps of dead tissue, fecal matter, and several liters of syrupy infection.  He was performing surgery in the swamps of Dagobah, except the swamps had just come out of this woman's ass and there was no Yoda.  He and I didn't say a word for the next ten minutes as he scraped the inside of the abscess until all the dead tissue was out, the front of his gown a gruesome mixture of brown and red, his eyes squinted against the stinging vapors originating directly in front of him.  I finished my required paperwork as quickly as I could, helped him stuff the recently-vacated opening full of gauze, taped this woman's buttocks closed to hold the dressing for as long as possible, woke her up, and immediately shipped off to the recovery ward. 

Until then, I'd only heard of ""alcohol showers.""  Turns out 70% isopropyl alcohol is about the only thing that can even touch a scent like that once its soaked into your skin.  It takes four or five bottles to get really clean, but it's worth it.  It's probably the only scenario I can honestly endorse drinking a little of it, too.

As we left the locker room, the surgeon and I looked at each other, and he said the only negative sentence I heard him utter in two and a half years of working together:

""That was bad.""

The next morning the entire department (a fairly large floor within the hospital) still smelled.  The housekeepers told me later that it took them nearly an hour to suction up all of the fluid and debris left behind.  The OR suite itself was closed off and quarantined for two more days just to let the smell finally clear out.

I laugh now when I hear new recruits to healthcare talk about the worst thing they've seen.  You ain't seen shit, kid.

303,"Easiest way/s to hack this account:

1. The email OP is using is easy to gain access to. The recover password option on the website allows for a user to simply enter the date of birth they entered when creating the website. It also doesn't lock out the user after a number of unsuccessful attempts. 

2. In the registration process for the email account, you must be over 13. This means that there are around 34,920 options possible. Hard to do by hand, but that's where the next step comes in. 

3. Make a script that will brute force all these combinations. This is where I got up to, but I'm busy af at the moment and can't continue on this step. However, I was able to try the 1st of January for all years and May 15th for all years. These were the two possibilities that I thought would be the most common

3.  Additionally, instead of making a script, you can make a mouse macro which would do the same thing. Easier for a basic user to do, but not as accurate, slower and just not as good. 

4. Wait. My method took 0.8 seconds per attempt, running on a few computers on separate gigabit connections. This would take about 8 hours, assuming the last attempt I make is the correct attempt. This is definitely within OPs 7 day range. 

5. Use the forgot password link on Jagex's website to recover the account, now that you have access to the email. 

Now, since this is an email hack, I don't really think it would fit OPs point that he/she is trying to prove that Jagex's security is impenetrable. And it would seem unreasonable for Jagex to be able to prevent this attack. 

The only conceivable way for Jagex to fix this would be to lock the account for a day or so, while a new password application is requested. And that seems a bit bad, as it would waste a day for people who legitimately forget their password. 

Also, I'm not going to give my script to anyone. I've contacted the owners of the email hosting company and let them know of their mistake. And, I'm not continuing in this challenge, eg my code for this will never run again on this email hosting website. I'm not going to go into detail on how I made my code to solve this problem. You just have to git gud at network security and pen testing, as well as basic website development. ",2016-05-15 14:45:03+00:00,d36cb2p,1.0,t3_4jfu6t,9213.0,2007scape

Didn't play for 2-3 months then came the rank shift. Played a few casuals and third party dm servers, and I get placed into silver 2. I've been in silver 2 before and eventually worked my way to sem, so I thought this was alright. 

Every game that I have played has been a shitshow. People leaving. I was in a game once where we vote kicked a player because they were trolling. Eventually, everyone else left until it was just me. We lost 4-16, with those 4 rounds being the first pistol round for both sides, and two were me soloing using the bots. People blatantly hacking. I once saw a guy with the name ""x's alt"", clicked on his profile and saw his real account in his friends list, vacced for csgo. His alt had 7 hours playtime. Smurfs fucking galore, every game I play with a smurf and it is cancer. Some games we win 16-0. Some we lose 0-16. Some we tie 15-15. There is no balance. Some games we verse a legitimate player who goes 42-3. Sometime their whole team has less than 200 hours played combined and they demolish us. Sometimes they have 4K hours combined and we win. 

I can really relate to the whole ""pressing accept is like flipping a coin"" metaphor. Sadly, I haven't played CSGO since this has happened, because mm at very low ranks is just terrible. I feel sorry for anyone getting into this game now and experiencing the mess of the silver ranks. ",2016-03-21 23:52:33+00:00,d18ihgb,4.0,t1_d180cep,25512.0,GlobalOffensive

I know that not all teachers are liberal, as I personally know some; however teachers who wish to voice their opinions are almost all liberal in my book. 

It pissed me off because children are so impressionable. I was in grade 5 during Obamas first election, and the teacher asked us to raise our hand if we would vote for Obama. At that point I had just moved to the US, and had no clue regarding his policies. I'm pretty sure no one else had any idea of his policies.

508,"Okay it seems like I have solved the issue. It was a bit technical so I'm going to write up what happened. I suspect that there is a faulty VRM chip in either the CPU or motherboard (?) for a specific core, either 5, 6, 7, or 8. By disabling half of the cores (only keeping cores 1, 2, 3, and 4 running), I was bypassing the broken core/core VRM.

The reason I thought there was a broken core/core VRM was because when going into the bios settings and reducing the CPU voltage, CPU-z would still display a voltage higher than what I reduced it to. Eg. I reduced it to 1.2v from 1.25v stock, and CPU-z read between 1.3v and 1.4v.

Immediately I saw better temps and performance, however it was still bouncing off the thermal ceiling of 45C. I'm not sure why the thermal ceiling is/was 45C, however that is an issue for another day. I went into the bios and underclocked my CPU and turned off temporary CPU clock speed boosting settings.

I underclocked from 3.6ghz -&gt; 3.3ghz and undervolted from 1.25v -&gt; 1.075v. Now, my CPU runs better under full load performance wise, and my temps hit a max of 25C at full load and a minimum of 15C at idle.",2016-03-11 23:24:31+00:00,d0wklor,1.0,t3_49s09x,153558.0,techsupport

512,"I hate that feeling of hopelessness when you know shits going to go down in the next 5 seconds tops and you can't do anything about it. 

I was at the beach one day with a small inflatable one seater boat. Both myself and my mate had one, and they came with paddles but we ditched them after a while because they were shit. It's nowhere near high tide, but the waves are coming in pretty hard. 

A bit of background, the beach we were in was a cove. It would have been around 5kms between the beach and the heads. While we were about 100m away from the shore I notice that there is a pretty strong rip pulling us along the beach south. This doesn't worry me too much because the beach kind of curves around and so if anything we would end up hitting the shore around 1km south. 

Only issue with this was that we didn't notice it was pulling us out to the sea too. I had faith in my blow up boat, but not enough to trust it to get me from where I was to the heads that were 10km away. 

We quickly realised we were around 250-300m out to sea, and at this point it got a bit scary because of how far away the sand was. I knew if I got out of my boat, I would not be able to feel the sand at the sea floor. Being an Australian beach, I was also pretty aware of sharks and other dangerous shit (turns out a week later that same beach was closed for a day because of a shark sighting). 

We didn't panic; we just tied our boats together and paddled with our hands and pushed us south towards the beach. It took us longer than we expected, but we ended up being around 100m out from the shore at around 3km south of our starting point. At this point, the waves were really picking up, and starting to break around where we were. While the waves did push us towards the shore, they also pulled us out even more with the tide. 

Then came the wave. There was a lull in the water for a bit, and we gained around 25m towards the shore. I look behind us and see the biggest wave I have ever seen, no exaggeration. At first I thought it could push us in all the way, but then I noticed it started to break. I told my mate to hold on, and we faced the wave. At this point I knew we were fucked. There was no way we could avoid this wave. I thought we may as well try and hold onto something inflatable so we don't drown. 

It must have been around 5 seconds until the wave crashed right on top of us. We were both thrown from the boats and tumbled underwater. I lost sense of direction, then surprisingly felt the ground with my cheek. I pushed up and saw we were about 30m from the shore. Looked around and couldn't see the boats anywhere until my mate pointed them out. I could barely see them, but they must have been 300m from the shore. 

Normally getting smashed by a wave is pretty scary, but this situation of benign caught in a rip fucked me off of the sea for a while. Still haven't been back, shit was scary. ",2016-03-10 13:31:25+00:00,d0unk1k,2.0,t1_d0ueq05,28056.0,therewasanattempt

637,"Early model evo X SST transmissions usually have issues, anything before 2010 had a different clutch padding (?) (not too sure what was different) that increased wear and lead to more frequent servicing. 

The SST model will have better trim, eg it will come with the Rockford fosgate sound system, better brakes, wheels, suspension, and a few other interior things. 

I'm currently in the same situation, however I don't have to make my decision for another 2 years or so. I find myself swapping between the two every day, however I am leaning towards the manual. I'm using the car for a daily driver, and I have heard that it runs high in the revs at highway speeds on the manual, however the manual can be modded to make more power easier than the SST, as the SST can only handle so much torque. 

In terms of cost of services, the SST is recommended to have fluids changed every 45000 kms, and this can cost around $1000-$2000 depending on where you live etc. the manual will be cheaper to service. 

Finally, due to less power being lost through a manual gearbox than an SST, the manual has a slightly higher power output at the wheels, and a higher power to weight ratio. ",2016-02-02 13:27:52+00:00,czkxx21,1.0,t3_43td47,18270.0,mitsubishi

679,"Instead of immediately shooting me down and disregarding my opinion, could you look at where I'm coming from first?

Let's say all jobs pay the same after aggressive progressive taxing under a left winged government. A $50k per year retail job is the same as a $50k per year managerial role at a company. 

But the retail job, anyone could do given they have social skills. The managerial job on the other hand, requires years of experience and training. Additionally, the retail job may only be a 38 hour week. But the managerial job may be up to 50-60, depending on the companies requirements. Constant phone calls and emails, business trips and taking clients out to dinner quickly add up. It is clear that the managerial job here takes more effort. If you were to ask almost anyone, they would rather have the retail job, because it's a less stressful job, pays the same, and less work to do. 

How do we fix this? We increase the amount that the job pays. How can we achieve this? Reduce the aggressive progressive taxing that the left winged government implemented. 

I know this is an extreme example, but hear me out. ",2016-01-15 20:14:21+00:00,cyzlh5q,4.0,t1_cyz8fry,18455.0,Jokes

League of Legends? DOTA 2? Companies like Riot and Valve make billions of dollars a year in revenue, so they can afford this. Jagex? Not so much. As a result, they need to save money. Take one look at the daily ""Australian servers"" post on /r/2007scape and you will notice that Jagex doesn't care about Australia that much. Whether it's because they believe we make up a small amount of the user base, or that we will pay membership regardless of server condition, they aren't going to do anything to improve Australian server conditions. 

Speaking to the service provider won't help at all. I don't see how they will be able to help if services like LoL and DOTA are able to be hosted without an issue, and Runescape is facing issues.

Other than that, it is a legendary car. I daily a 2010 VRX (Australia equivalent of the GTS) and I love it. 

One tip that I learned while doing a defensive driving course though, when you brake hard enough that you trigger ABS and come to a complete stop from a speed of above 40kmh/25mph, you will remain in the higher gear ratio. So what that means is that if the CVT transmission was in ""6th gear"" or equivalent when braking, when you go to accelerate after a very hard brake it will be the equivalent of taking off in 6th gear; you will need a lot of accelerator and the car will slowly take off.

750,"Taxing speculative trading means that farmers and other producers of commodities like rice/wheat etc. take the risk when selling rather than traders and investors. 

Let's take the example of a farmer who produces wheat. At the moment, before he plants anything, he can speak to an investor and say ""I'll have 100 tons of wheat for sale in June"" (I have no fucking clue how long wheat takes to grow I'm sorry) and the investor says, ""okay, I'll give you $10 million now for that"" or ""I'll give you $10 million in June"". This means that if wheat was to crash in price, the farmer would still get his $10 million (still, I'm sorry no fucking clue how much wheat costs).

In this situation, the farmer has no risk. If his crops die, his insurance covers it. If wheat crashes, he still has his money.

Taxing speculation and future trading would discourage this practice. The US produces a lot of corn and other crops for domestic use. Smaller farms would suffer, as they could either take a pay cut, or take a risk on how the wheat market will be in 6 months time and choose to sell them then.

I thought, that would be a great time to go fletch/flip on the GE, but then I had an idea to walk around Keldagrim. 

I was walking around, looking at random shops and buying cool stuff. I bought a pair of trousers from the clothing lady and a shirt, went to the bars and had a chat with the bartenders, ate a few kebabs and drank some beers, then walked onto the bridge that connects the east and west cities and looked out onto the water and turned up the in game volume. It was such a nice break from the grind of quests. I thought some of the chat options I went through were pretty funny and interesting.
