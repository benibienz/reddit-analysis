2. You don't need to spend it all

3. Anything left over you can spend on mods

My mates and I thought of this, and we thought it was pretty cool. We set up a bunch of challenges to compare our cars on, including:
 
 - Time for one lap of goliath
 - Time to drive from one side of the airport runway to the other
 - Longest burnout
 - Shortest 160kmh-0 time
 - Style
 - Time for one lap of an offroad race
 - Most engine power

I chose a Datsun 510, and spent 12k on the auction house. I then made it AWD, chucked an inline 6 into it and put on a turbo. All up it cost $30,300. We haven't done the challenges yet, but I'll keep everyone updated on them

Bought a DE razor kit today for a bit of fun. I spent around $60 all up and it came with a Wahl DE, a plastic bowl, a stand, a boar brush, and I bought some Wilkinson swords razors.

I got home, and immediately tried it out. I had a lot of fun shaving for the first time with the DE, however I noticed that I ended with a lot of small cuts in the area between my bottom lip and the top of my chin (6 to be exact). 

In my years using cartridge razors, I've only very seldom gotten cut. Am I doing something wrong? I was going slowly the whole time, and I am not too sure what I was doing that could have caused it as I didn't feel when the cuts occurred.

I suspect maybe it is because the area between my lip and chin is contoured more than the other parts of my face, but surprisingly I didn't have any issues with the area above my top lip and under my nose which I think is contoured worse.",wicked_edge,What am I doing wrong?

I've heard that the Alienware X51 has a mini ITX motherboard inside of it. Does that mean that the screw mounting positions are in the same location as a regular mini ITX motherboard? Also, is the motherboard powered by the standard PSU motherboard connector, i.e. will the motherboard run with a different PSU that can handle the wattage?

I know that Dell and HP sometimes custom make their motherboards so just asking for clarification. My mate is selling his X51 and I might ask for the motherboard+CPU, and I was just wondering if I would have any issues swapping the motherboard and CPU in with my system",Alienware,Alienware X51 motherboard specs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alienware/comments/4n4yfp/alienware_x51_motherboard_specs/

Less click intensive, less xp/hr, possible profit. Allow charcoal to be used in place of coal for smithing. 

How charcoal is made IRL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzLvqCTvOQY

**Similar to how bars are smelted in a furnace, allow players to make charcoal in a furnace using logs**. This will allow a player to train firemaking in a less click intensive way. Lower tier woods would give less charcoal to keep it balanced. The table below shows how many logs are needed for one charcoal. This may be modified to balance the system.

Normal Logs | Oak Logs | Willow Logs | Maple Logs | Yew Logs | Magic Logs
---|---|----|----|----|----
7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2

XP/HR will be slower than firemaking with a tinderbox. There is a possibility this can be added into the woodcutting guild. The process would be similar to making bars in a furnace.

**But why charcoal?**

At the moment, charcoal is relatively useless, only used for a few quests and that's it. But, why not allow it to be used in the place of regular coal? This will allow for a bit of money making while training fire making too. A player might want to use willow logs to make charcoal and net a profit, or use magic logs for more xp/hr but less gp/hr. At this time, charcoal has the same store price as coal, but charcoal is roughly 120gp extra on the GE. I expect this to balance out after a week or so.

This would remove the bulk of supply of coal from boss monsters such as Zulrah and focus back on materials being provided from skilling. This will also reduce the cost of training smithing.",2007scape,[Suggestion] Making charcoal for firemaking xp,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/4m03xe/suggestion_making_charcoal_for_firemaking_xp/

So where I live prevents people from ""extending the network"". This is a bit of a pain for me, since my room only has one ethernet port. I have a desktop, laptop and server. I want to extend the wired network so I can use more devices at the same time. 

I can't use a switch/hub because the outside network will see multiple IPs/mac addresses from a single ethernet port. I spoke with a mate about this, and he recommended using a router.

He told me to:

* Enable promiscuous mode
* Disable traceroutes
* Hide wireless SSID (doesn't bother me as I won't be using wireless at all)

Is there anything else I should take note of? Is there any way of a sysadmin finding my router is not a computer and actually a router?

I am looking at buying a TP Link WDR4300 (I already own one, and its pretty decent). My network is full gigabit. If anyone has any other recommendations for routers I am all ears.

One day I was chilling at the GE, and someone threw me a gnomeball, so I threw it to someone else. The guy that I threw it to had a pretty funny unique name, so I remembered it.

A few days later, he was still standing at the GE on the same world, still holding the gnomeball, fletching. I try start a conversation with him, but he didn't reply. I go onto crystal math labs and start tracking his xp. I see him a few days later, and that reminded me to check his xp again.

[This is what I saw.](http://i.imgur.com/jSqNvEM.png) In 32 hours, he gained around 1.2m fletching experience, just by fletching bows. Yew longbows are around 100-110k/hr in my experience. This guy must have been playing 10 hours in the last 32.

Now I decided to stalk him some more. On the runescape highscores, he is between rank 200-300 in fletching with xp in the 30 million range, and he has no xp in any other skills. I have a look at the highscores, and I see like 5 other accounts all with the same amount of xp in fletching and no other skills, so I tracked them.

They have different names, names that I would consider pretty clever/funny. Is this some guy that afk fletches on 10 accounts while playing his main, or something else? Surely if it was a bot it would have been caught before it reached in the 30 million xp mark by playing 10+ hours a day.

Not going to mention names because its fishy as fuck. Here are three people on the highscores I found, all within 10 ranks of each other, with unique usernames and similar stats. http://i.imgur.com/VPraWpi.jpg

I hit him a few times, and use whip spec to get some run energy back. I kill him, and he drops a few items, including green dhide chaps and vambs, rune dagger (p) and 4 torags hammers, noted. I pick up all of his shit, and get frozen from his friends. At this point, I eat to full and then tele out.

I get to edgeville, and that's when I notice I have the torags hammers. Bored, I check my items kept on death screen. They protected over everything except my dragon legs, which means that I could have lost my whip.

So we know that Jagex cannot afford servers in Australia that run 24/7. As an Australian that plays the game, I can agree that merching and woodcutting/other low intensity tasks are bearable on 300+ ping. However, if I wish to do fight caves, or PVM, I am SOL. It would be impossible on high ping. 

Let's have a compromise. Weekend servers (servers that are only on/available during the weekend) in Australia will not cost as much as servers that run 24/7. Hell, even once monthly servers that run for 2 days are acceptable. 

The money being spent on the deadman tournament could be put to use better. $10,000 is *a lot* of money, and we can assume that it will all go to RoT. Regardless whether you like RoT or not, this is a silly idea. Why even bother having a competition? The ending is obvious. The money is better spent on other infrastructure, which may include Australian servers.

I bought this headunit from a person I know for a pretty cheap price. It was sold as broken. After disassembling it, reconnecting the flex cable that was loose and reassembling it, the thing worked perfectly.

Now, I was having some issues with the CD drive, and in my haste I broke the header on the board that connected the screen to the main board, [as seen here](http://i.imgur.com/FJJzdgr.jpg). Originally there was a black clip that held onto the flex cable as it was inserted, however the black clip fell off.

As a result, the flex cable is not able to get contact on several of the pins on the flex cable header. I have tried blu tac (removable mounting putty) however this has lead to only a few pins making contact.

The flex cable is working perfectly, I have tested each line with a multi meter and there is no issues with the cable. 

I think I have two ways to go about fixing this. 

1. I could get a new ribbon cable such as an old IDE HDD cable and solder the pins on the board and display unit together. I'm shithouse when it comes to soldering so I think this will be an issue.

2. I could somehow desolder the header and solder a new, unbroken header in its place. I have no idea where I would find the new header.

If I wanted to buy osrs gp with rs3 gp, I could buy a bond in rs3, log into osrs, and sell it. 

Pros:

 - No scamming

 - No swapping clans getting a portion of each swap

Cons:

 - Can only trade in multiples of bonds (2m osrs minimum trade)

 - Osrs economy may affect rs3 economy, and so forth.",2007scape,How to solve swapping,http://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/3fxmap/how_to_solve_swapping/

Today marked my second day of splashing, and I was running low on mind runes.

I teleported to Varrock, and bought some from Aubury. As I hopped to my second world, I disconnected. This was weird, I am probably in the minority of people who have never disconnected from old school, but when I went to log back in, it said my account was locked because they think it was hijacked.

I have authenticator, antivirus, etc. literally every method of preventing my account from being hijacked. I recovered my account in less than a minute, but I was wondering whether anyone else has had this happen to them.

Also, my acc has seemed a bit suspicious in the last few days I guess, I started playing after a few months off from a new IP, traded my friends around 10m worth of bonds to get them to become members, and started leveling defense (I used to be a zerker), in addition to being logged in 24/7 on another computer.",2007scape,Anyone else had this happen to them?,http://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/3emd45/anyone_else_had_this_happen_to_them/
