0," My friend's mom was a mail order bride. It was basically OK. My friend was well-adjusted and didn't seem to have unusual domestic problems, the husband/stepfather was older, but definitely not a bad person. If a woman of her beauty had grown up here, she might have written him off as a ""loser"". But, from what I gather, it's not unusual for people in 'normal' marriages to eventually come to regard each other with contempt. ",2016-10-19 05:18:16+00:00,d8ydt7k,1,t3_586rno,25145,AskReddit

14," What it's like to see the world through another's eyes. It's an extremely mundane point to suppose that others have minds. When we talk to each other we seem to be perfectly certain that the other can see hear and smell the same as us. We so used to other people they can quickly even become boring to us.

 But it's just so impossible to imagine being someone completely different, with a whole different life story, memories, vantage point, hopes and dreams. I myself can't hold all of that in my mind at once, I just visit it piece by piece depending on events I can't control. One day I'll have a trip down memory lane, one day I'll think about my dreams, I never have the whole picture of my being in mind, let alone someone else's being. The strangest thing is trying to imagine what it's like to be someone else looking at me. So freaky that to everyone else on this planet, I'm someone else. To someone else I could be a random passerby, the face of a dead man on evening news, a floor sales guy I don't want to talk to because all he wants to do is get me to buy insurance. From the same distant vantage point that I regard so many strangers is how I am viewed by them. ",2016-10-15 04:35:04+00:00,d8sqot1,1,t3_57k9at,5484,AskReddit

40," Pay close attention to how you walk. As you know, it's a really simple periodic motion. At an instant as you're walking, you have one foot ahead of the other. Then, you make a step and now the other foot is ahead of the other. You make one more step, and now the original foot is ahead of the second. You've made it full circle to the original position. Therefore, there are really only two steps no matter how far you walk.

Now, the key to approaching a woman is to make sure that these two steps have some very specific properties. Consider the first step out of the original foot position. Let us call it: step 1. The second step, the one that brings you back to the original foot position, would therefore be step 2 under this scheme. For you to successfully approach a woman step 1 you must be attractive and step 2 you absolutely cannot be unattractive. 

If you follow this advice closely, you will never have to worry about coming off as a creeper as you approach an woman you're interested in. ",2016-06-22 16:16:31+00:00,d4jj14n,1,t3_4pbf75,674,AskReddit
