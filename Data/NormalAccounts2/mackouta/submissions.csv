That is considered alarming by many and some say that there is a student debt crisis in the U.S. 

But I can see people paying off 25k. It's about the cost of a car. It may be burdensome or unfair, but anybody can be reasonably expected to pay that off.

 Then there are people who have 100k-200k in student debt. How do they pay that off? With amounts that massive, at least half of the amount must have come from private lenders. I can understand a doctor or an engineer paying that off as these career paths lead to high salaries. But what about those who take out such loans for less lucrative degrees? 

 Moreover, how does it work from a lender's perspective? I can understand doctors since they can expect a high salary and medical school have a very high graduation and job placement rate. But why would a lender risk 6 figures on a law or engineering student who is much more likely to drop out and, in the case of a law student, much less likely to find a high-paying job? That goes double for courses of study where high compensation isn't even on the table. How do they figure they will get their money back? When it gets to a point that the debt is as large as mortgage, do lenders not fear that it would be an economically sound decision for debtors to simply start over in a different country?",explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How do people with massive student loans pay them off and how do they get them in the first place?,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5chmwm/eli5_how_do_people_with_massive_student_loans_pay/

I had options and I chose Vchems for my order because they seemed to have a solid reputation in the community and someone even PMed me and vouched for the site.

When did I make my order? I don't even remember anymore. It was early-mid June. On the very same day I made my order, I asked how long the shipping might take. I was told basically that it can take up to 3 weeks but can even take as little as 5 business days. This was at a time when they *knew* they would be having shipping problems. They knew this and they didn't think to mention it at all.

Soon I also found out that they're having trouble shipping things because my order moved quickly through processing but was stuck in ""awaiting shipment"" all week long. I asked them what is going on, they admitted they are having some problems but everything should be fine in just a few days. Then it was the end of the week. Then it was next week. Finally, I asked them again at the very end of July why my order still hasn't shipped when I'm seeing people on reddit who ordered after me already getting their packages. Mysteriously, the next time I go back on the site my order is ""shipped"". I thought that was a little suspicious. 

Now it's been over 30 days, nearly 40! Order not received. Slip from customs notifying me of seizure? not received. Refund for the difference between the 20 Euro shipping I paid for and the shitty untracked shipping that might not even exist? Not received. 

What is this site still doing in any category in the sidebar other than ""treat with caution"" or ""avoid""?

0/5

If the package ever does arrive, I'll upgrade them to 1/5 because they still withheld information, made false promises, and refused to do an actual refund on shipping that they unilaterally downgraded.",RCSources,VChems review,https://www.reddit.com/r/RCSources/comments/4w59s2/vchems_review/
