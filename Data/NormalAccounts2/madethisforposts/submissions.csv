Even working 12 of 17 years of my life on this diploma, I just don't fucking care.

So what if I graduate? What was the point of school? I have ADD and I won't remember any of the shit I spent my whole life learning.

And if I do graduate, I still have to go to college for another four years. I only imagine college being worse than high school; like high school but without the fun. Just more intense studying and school work. I can't focus enough to do that shit.

And when I do graduate and get a job, then what? I work my entire life suffering work until I die? Only difference in how hard I work now depends on how hard will I be working my whole life.

Even if I did find a job that I ""enjoy"" I feel like I'm just always feeling like shit inside. I really have no goal in life and never have. I don't even know what career I want to pursue, I never want to do anything important.

My drive in life at one point was to find love but tbh love just seems like bullshit to me. Everyone I've ever known to be in a relationship has said that relationships suck and that being single feels more free. I can't even emotionally handle having friends that are girls because I always end up developing feelings for them.

I can't even have real fun with anybody either because I always feel like no one truly understands me. When a relationship feels like shit, it feels like shit. When a relationship feels perfect, it feels too fake. So I end up having this disconnection with people deep inside. I wish I could just appreciate the differences between us all.

I feel like by the time I get used to having a job and having a family, I'll just be one of those adults who are always stressed and dead inside.
