2,"I loved the universal registry called MyRegistry. It helped me to compile a lot of the things that I thought I needed, like a cloth diaper service, etc. Because I was able to put in anything I wanted, I found that my registry list exceeded my expectations. If you still have trouble about what to put in your registry, you can also check out their inspiration boards and see what other people are adding on their site. Personally, that helped me a lot. You should look into it. ",2016-08-22 19:12:35+00:00,d6s87li,1,t3_4z12b0,13354,BabyBumps

5,"I call for MyRegistry.com! It's weird how a lot of people arent mentioning this site. Personally for me, it's the best. You get all the benefits from all the stores you are adding gifts from (including Amazon and Target), and you can add anything from anywhere, and it's so convenient to use. My guests loved it, too!

6, I use myregistry bc all of these retailers are partnered with them. I opened up registries at a bunch of these stores and I wanted to keep everything in one place. Myregistry allows u to do that while receiving all the store benefits u mentioned at the same time. Just letting all of you know! Oh.. also got to put my diaper service on there too. ,2016-07-26 16:31:48+00:00,d5rnh76,1,t3_4khefp,5653984,Baby_Registry_Ideas
