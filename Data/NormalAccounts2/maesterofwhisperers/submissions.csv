**Tyrion**  
**Daenarys**  
**Jon Snow** (for real)  
**Arya**  

The show made it's name on killing characters that were both beloved and apparently vital to the plot. They haven't done that since the red wedding.

The biggest shock of Ned and Rob/Catelyn dying was that it really appeared that the show's plot hinged on them (i.e. plot armor). They haven't killed anyone like that since the third season. Hodor was loved, sure, but his death didn't cost anything. Jon's death didn't cost anything because they brought him back, obviously.


These are the characters that are both beloved and central to the plot, or at least central to most of the fan-theories about the ending. You can argue Sansa is in there too since she recently became a popular character after this strong season.

Honestly, I like Dany but killing her before she ever makes it to Westeros would be the biggest gut punch to the fans and I would love it.
