I'd recommend googling ""oregon habitable rental units"" and see what you can find, but I think you'll probably be disappointed.

1/2, 2, 5, 10 oz and kilos are unlimited mintages, which I believe means they can keep minting them while Series II is running.

You never know what you're going to get outside of the maximum mintages. For example, here's some 1/2 oz mintages:

* 1/2oz Bullion Lunar Silver Dragon Coin 2012, 389,161
* 1/2oz Bullion Lunar Silver Snake Coin 2013, 160,616
* 1/2oz Bullion Lunar Silver Horse Coin 2014, 249,155
* 1/2oz Bullion Lunar Silver Goat Coin 2015, 188,442
* 1/2oz Bullion Lunar Silver Monkey Coin 2016, 127,688

For 1/2 oz you'd obviously have wanted the monkeys, not the horses or dragons. Note, these numbers are not final mintages, only currently *declared* mintages, i.e., they will go up until Series II ends.

A startup led by a brash, charismatic CEO catches a creaky old industry unaware.

661,"Yep.

The problem I ran into with Bootstrap was not finding browser support.  I  think I ended up on a variation of Bootstrap 3 to try and target older IE. I kind of gave up researching that....It did let me download just the css grid, so that was cool (no sass/less requirements). It's an option to prototype out and hit in IE 10.

*edit:* http://bootstrapdocs.com/ looks promising for finding browser support per version (though not every version has this, or it's inconsistently documented).

Foundation 5 looked to be pretty good as I found browser support info there that went back to IE9.  It doesn't look like you can custom download old versions, though, you get the whole shebang, which I don't need. Nor do I really want to try and whittle it down to just the grid.

Skeleton is my go to for small, simple responsive, but 2.0 doesn't have push/pull. Nested grids can have issues as well, I think....And if I remember right, it doesn't even handle responsive images, though that's easy to add, I don't recall that being handled in the source css at all.

How many commercials or billboards or radio ads or print ads did you see for ODS-&gt;Moda?  **Everyone** in town became aware of Moda with the naming rights.

1292,"&gt; Moda is a PR nightmare- spending a lot of money rebranding from ODS to Moda, then spending additional money on naming a sports arena 

To be fair, ""Moda"" is much more than ODS (Oregon Dental Service) nowadays. That's why they rebranded.

Re: the Rose Garden naming rights, that makes sense as well, they just rebranded and everyone in town (as well as those watching any televised event) now know the Moda brand (they also sponsor women soccer up in Seattle, though [Moda is out of Washington now](http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/blog/health-care-inc/2015/10/moda-pulls-out-of-washington-insurance-market.html) so I imagine the soccer thing will end). They went into California ([now out](http://www.oregonlive.com/business/index.ssf/2015/10/moda_to_shut_down_in_two_state.html)) and I'd imagine they were hoping to rapidly expand there as well as possibly other western states...Whether the rename offends you or not, that's irrelevant, they didn't buy naming rights, they bought *advertising*.

The problem with Moda is they put way too much risk in the ACA risk corridor. Management's job is to manage risk and they really fucked that up.  But management didn't pay the price, nor will they. Their customers (through increased premiums/deductibles) and the folks they laid off are the ones that pay for management's very poor job.",2016-03-03 18:56:12+00:00,d0mc2jw,4.0,t1_d0ma6xa,2443.0,Portland

Those ""close to double"" prices you're seeing have got to be on the much lower mintages/years. You also have to look at what they're really selling for, not what a vendor is asking for them. There will always be plenty of recent pandas on the market, which obviously affects the resale value.

**2. The petro-dollar will end, the American way of life will be something that will be destroyed.** The inflation will be over 9,000% because Americans are getting their lifestyle subsidized by the rest of the world. This is a very complicated issue…but to be summed up quickly, the petro-dollar will end, the American way of life will be something that will be destroyed.

When that happens – when the rest of the world finally turns its back on the United States – you’d better be positioned in the right assets… Hard. Tangible. Assets...5 gallon buckets of dehydrated cottage cheese, pop tarts, tang, ammo (lots of ammo) and junk silver to barter with.

You will get laid off at some point in your career, it's really just a matter of time.  I was laid off from my last job (December 31 of 2011) which was a really strong company, they just shifted to a dev outsourcing model. No big deal, I understand, it's just business. I was there 3 years.

I started a new job the Monday after my last Friday at the old job.  They were courteous enough to give us 3 months notice and also paid me 3 months severance as well. So for the first 3 months of 2012 I was getting double pay.

Layoffs aren't always bad, but that's more so if you're not afraid of change.

You should also not be counting on any employer for your career path. You need to take control of that.

Obviously, your company has no loyalty to you and they will sack you without a care in the world.  You should not fall into the trap of being loyal to your company.  They pay you for your labor, nothing more.

The company I'm with right now just went through 2 rounds of layoffs, though the second one was tiny compared to the first. I think management did a poor job with the first one and should have rounded up the folks in the second batch.  2 rounds is much worse for moral than 1 round.

* Their 5 acres looks to be mostly unusable, they look to have pretty much bought mostly a side of a hill (though it does have good trees).
* One of their videos was about the permitting process. The video seemed to indicate they had no idea what this would entail for them.  I got the impression they didn't do this homework *before* they bought the property. They complained about $50k permit fees from where they moved from. They could have just as easily been screwed on their new property.
* They talk about drilling a well, but no mention of doing any research to see what common well depths in the area are. When drilling a well, you pay until you hit water or run out of money, lol...Similar to the permitting process, doesn't seem like they researched a lot before they bought.

I have the [sweetest German Shepherd you could ever meet](http://pix.avaxnews.com/avaxnews/de/40/000040de_medium.jpeg). There's a reason the police and military use them (intelligence, size and strength). I have never had a better dog.

Only applicable if you own, but buy [security doors](http://dcs-ind.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/DCS-Security-Door-10.jpg) for all your exterior doors. There are many styles at Home Depot and Lowes. They are easy to install. Home Depot and Lowe's can handle the installation as well, if you don't feel handy enough.

I have these installed and they're fantastic. I don't even think you need the highest security rating doors. What security doors say to scumbags is ""my neighbor is an easier target"". As far as I'm concerned they are more a visual deterrent than an actual security barrier. They're also nice in that you can leave your doors open in the summer time to get air flow but still be secure.

Everyone's door is ""secured"" by 1"" of pine wood (which could be split or near 100 years old). Take a look at where your deadbolt goes into the door frame next time you have the door open. That's your security.  It is so trivial to kick a door in.

Also, if you have windows you don't use, [cut down some wooden dowels and use those as window jams](http://charlesandhudson.com/wp/photos/dowel-window-security.jpg). Same with a sliding glass door. Doesn't matter if your windows are ""locked"", cut down some dowels and bar them up. The dowels will fit right into the window track so you won't even see them. You could also paint them whatever color your window frames are.

I also have a home security system (came with the house) which is what I believe the standard home security system is: It has those little sensors that pair up with every door and window and when those doors and windows move, the sensors decouple which triggers either the alarm or the countdown. They also sense breaking glass and trigger the alarm.

Keep in mind, I don't keep any silver at home and I live in a nice neighborhood, but I do take home security seriously. There are easy things you can do.",2015-11-08 16:50:42+00:00,cwsyxlo,1.0,t3_3rz3s3,42663.0,Silverbugs

Assuming they don't have a minimum transaction amount. You need to look at more than just the posted buy back price.

Monarch, I believe, has a 10 oz minimum and offer 95-98% of spot (I think 99% if it's their branded bars). They seem to be pretty friendly for smaller transactions. I think APMEX's buyback prices are based on a 10k minimum transaction. They will buy less but they'll offer you less in that type of deal, i.e., might get low balled in which case you'd most likely be better over at /r/pmsforsale selling at 99% of spot or something.

2122,"Sorry for the delay, been busy and haven't had a lot of time to get caught up on this myself...It's shipping out tonight (Friday), actually in the air as I type this, but the order has gone from bad to worse.

They threw in next day shipping (which I didn't ask for, nor particularly care about) but the problem is I can't update the shipment via my UPS account to pick up my package at a UPS location.  They have restricted that option.

Since it's Friday eve and it'll be on the delivery truck Monday am there is no same day/next day opportunity for APMEX to update the shipment on their end where I can then have the delivery changed. The expedited shipping will turn out to be a complete waste on their end financially and a big inconvenience on my end because...

Historically, what this means is I'll have to call UPS Monday eve when I get home and see the delivery attempt note they left. If UPS can't do anything about it, because there are restrictions on it by APMEX, I'll have to contact APMEX to update the order where I can then change it.  This will then be on Tuesday APMEX time (assuming they turn it around same day), where it'll again be on the truck out to deliver to me, when I'm at work...I might get it Wednesday, assuming I can make it in time to pick it up, but most likely Thursday. Friday would be my last day to pick it up otherwise UPS sends it back to APMEX, lol.  The rub is, when this shit has played out in the past, packages are held at a UPS location just over 20 miles away, so it's about a 42 mile round trip, in rush hour traffic. As you can imagine, that sucks ass.

If they would have just shipped it out regular USPS priority like all my other APMEX orders, I could have easily picked it up after work Tuesday. Again, lol.

I'm sending them a letter explaining how their attempt to ""help"" has done the opposite. All I wanted was an honest update on my order, their compulsion to give me this great ""customer service"" has totally backfired in this case.

They really should allow customers to change the delivery to a UPS location of their choice. Removing options which are more convenient for the customer is much worse customer service, IMO.

Of course looking back, I should have inquired about the details of the next day delivery or just requested they send it regular USPS priority.  I assumed if the next day was not USPS (which gives me no issues), I'd be able to update the delivery like I do with other vendors shipping UPS or FedEx.

All in all, a shitty order that will probably arrive damaged with the way things are going :)",2015-09-26 04:10:51+00:00,cveis40,2.0,t1_cvderic,87499.0,Silverbugs

You're asking if you should wait to buy at a higher price in the future? No one knows if we've bottomed, we could hit the 13s next week, which may still not be the bottom. Only time tells you bottoms and tops. My advice is to buy what you're comfortable with and you should definitely be in for the long term.

**Bank holiday**: I don't think a bank holiday/seizure is very realistic and there would most likely be writing on the wall beforehand *if* we had bank holidays.  Think Greece.

I've never had a problem at either location with access, it's always literally been on-demand during normal office hours (including Saturdays).

**Theft**: When was the last time you heard of a bank being robbed where they stole the contents of hundreds of SDBs?  Or even just one SDB? I can't recall one. The bank robberies I hear about are teller robberies. Even then, I just don't hear about them that much.

**Natural disasters**: This is really the only one that has merit, IMO, and for me, it's really just fire threat. Well, my credit union has sprinklers and an actual fire suppression system in the vault.  Flooding isn't a threat and besides, my boxes are well up off the floor.  No hurricanes or tornadoes here, either.

For me, SDBs are piece-of-mind for not having that risk at home. Insurance is all a numbers game based on risk and some types of insurance I don't think are worth it.  But you're talking to a guy who has been paying auto insurance for nearly 30 years and who has never made a single claim.  I've never made a homeowner's claim, either. Insurance is almost as big a scam as religion.",2015-09-05 14:29:59+00:00,curiijo,1.0,t3_3jqhwe,8531.0,Silverbugs

Month-to-date, which is only five business days, the U.S. Mint has sold 5,000 troy ounces of gold eagles—1,000 one-ounce 24K gold buffaloes—and 1,180,000 silver eagles.  As I said in my Tuesday column, **it was my opinion that the 810,500 silver eagles sold on Monday, August 3, were actually sold the previous Friday on July 31, but pushed forward into August so that July wouldn’t be a record sales month.  And if that’s the case, and I believe it is, the mint has sold practically nothing so far this month because it has nothing to sell.**  The sales reported yesterday were of the hand-to-mouth variety, as they probably don’t have any working inventories in anything.

2367,"I can certainly speak to this as I store all my metals in two safety deposit boxes. **I store absolutely zero metals at home**, I don't want that security issue. Plus, I get my boxes for free. To make a long story short, I've been grandfathered in on a loyalty/rewards program. The boxes are not very popular at my credit union for some reason, so I realize I'm in a unique position with getting them for free. I just opened a 2nd account at a 2nd branch and got my 2nd box. I can actually do two more but those branches are about 20 miles away.

* The most important rule of thumb, IMO, would be you need to check to see what the rules are about keeping your box active. Some banks may use the word dormant instead of active.  For me, it's just a sign in system at the branch and I need to have some activity 1x a year. Or I need to contact the bank 1x a year. If you don't keep the box active, the bank can consider it dormant/unclaimed and at some point it goes to the State. It basically becomes unclaimed property and once the State has it, the bank can't do shit, so you'd be dealing strictly with the State at that point. The State then makes an attempt to contact you (from last known address). At some point (this probably varies state-to-state, but probably 2-3 years), if they never hear anything, it gets auctioned off.

* FDIC insurance does **not** cover the contents of your box.

* IRS can seize it so don't think you're ""out of the system"" with any assets, i.e., don't do anything stupid.

* Don't store anything you need emergency access to because you're limited to bank hours and (possibly) bank personnel.  For example, I have my passport and birth certificate at home. I keep *copies* of important documents in the box, but nothing original. There are two locks on my boxes, I have one key, the bank has another. I don't know how many bank personnel have the key. I've yet to be denied access because Barbara is on vacation or whatever. I dont' know if this is standard, I'd guess so, but can't really say.

* You should have a co-signer in case something happens to you, they will have access to your box.

* **Keep an updated inventory every time you add/remove crap and take a photo at the time.** Keep accurate physical records with dates.",2015-08-13 00:05:01+00:00,cu10q1l,1.0,t3_3gqtjx,24350.0,Silverbugs

One would think so, though I suppose there would possibly be an influx into what some might argue is the most recognizable/respected gov-minted coins out there?

Maples were up 1M coins in 2014 from 2013. [Libertads were down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertad_%28coin%29#Libertad_Silver_Series_.28Brilliant_Uncirculated.29_Minting_History..5B2.5D) but Libertad mintages are historically all over the place. I think it was somewhat well known that 2014 Libertads were going to be a lower mintage as I remember it being discussed last year.  I remember grabbing a 2nd tube on that low dip into the $14s the last Sunday of November last year because it was supposed to be a low mintage year.

2558,"&gt;It is getting nearly $800 million dollars from the feds for about 20 passenger rail improvement projects.

Amtrak has cost the government over $45 billion in subsidies over the last 44 years, allowing it to finance the upkeep of unprofitable routes, overstaffed trains, and the mismanagement of its food services.

Despite generous taxpayer subsidies, Amtrak has run operating losses every year since it began operating in 1971. Although these losses are declining, in 2014, the railroad reported what it described as a “strong” result, with an operating loss of only $227 million.

The operating loss is unlikely to continue to decline due to the losses in Amtrak’s long-distance routes, which bleed about $600 million annually. After factoring in depreciation and other expenses, Amtrak lost a total of $1.1 billion in 2014. 

Amtrak has had 44 years to become solvent without success.
