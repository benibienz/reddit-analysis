Data again comes from https://www.data.gov/ (there's a lot of it up top, the Vue app doesn't start until around line 1854 so scroll to the very bottom if you want to see that).

Built a really shitty ""tab"" component, which I fucked up by not using an index for the active/default state (it uses the county name). I don't have a parent &lt;tabs&gt; component, either, and it feels like I should....But that's OK as this is just bullshit on the lunch hour that I literally just made up as I went along. This was about 30 minutes work.

Toggling the nav as you click around feels a little odd (as well as not having that default highlighted state), I basically iterate through all the tabs and remove any active class and then toggle the active state on the current tab component.  **What's the best way to set up tabs in Vue that toggle active/current classes as you click through them?**

What I want to do next is set up some routing and have some state management, so if I click into Tillamook, the url changes to /Tillamook and if you load the page from that url, it restores that state/view.  **Does anyone know of any 2.0 tutorials for this I can check out?**",vuejs,"My second vue app, i.e., fucking around with vue (actually writing some code) on my lunch hour",https://www.reddit.com/r/vuejs/comments/5bw052/my_second_vue_app_ie_fucking_around_with_vue/

Everything is embedded in the html panel (including the sample data). You may need to click ""run with js"" on the output panel.

Data comes from https://www.data.gov/ which is an awesome resource with a metric shit ton of data. And let's face it, it's much easier to check out new tech with some real data to play with. If you're looking for data to play with, you should really check out data.gov.

This took me not quite 1/2 hour to build, it doesn't look like data.gov supports jsonp or cors so I just grabbed some data and dumped it inline in the javascript. At least I couldn't get jsonp or cors going in first attempts, so copy/paste it was.

What actually took me the longest to do was to get my fetchFakeData() method to fire on page load. I was using ready(), which wasn't working. I then dropped in the lifecycle methods to see when they fired. It looked like mounted was the event I wanted. Did a quick google and found ready() was deprecated in Vue 2 and I should be using mounted, lol.

I've done nothing but read about Vue so this was my first time writing actual Vue code using the first random set of data that I found that seemed interesting.

I have enterprise production experience with Angular 1.x and Knockout, have fucked around with React on my own time.

First impressions of Vue are really positive, I mean this was a breeze and while not impressive, this is something I could use to quickly prototype at work with real services, simple 1/2 hour stuff like this or  1/2 day - 2 day prototyping for more complicated things.

He has paid and I noticed in paypal the transaction says money received and it's OK to ship. There are a couple links with print shipping label and add tracking, but those aren't applicable for me since I'll be delivering.

Is there a mechanism in place for this in paypal where he can indicate he's accepted the delivery when I deliver?

I really started thinking about this with the recent Hillary 9/11 ""medical episode"" video. 

I first saw the video on the Twitter feed of the guy that took the video. He was being **flooded** with ""can we rebroadcast this across all our media outlets, including international"" type of requests from all sorts of media companies, as well as other means of contact, I'm sure.  They were only offering ""credit"" in return, I never saw any offers of monetary compensation.

I did a little research and it looks like he's getting paid, [Czech man who shot the Hillary Clinton fainting video will make more than $100,000 from licensing](http://www.recode.net/2016/9/13/12904738/hillary-clinton-fainting-video-murdoch-storyful-news-corp).

* [$80,000](http://tinyhouselistings.com/listing/scotts-valley-ca-12-boxed-haus-2/) for those that are wondering, located in Scott's Valley, CA
* Cool deck, but really needs some sort of safety railing
* Love the original container doors on the end
* Needs bigger windows
* The canopy above the sliding glass door is great, but it should be angled down a tad so water runs off
* Kitchen is not bad, though I would opted for no window and had cabinetry there. I'm a fan of bigger or double-basin sinks as well
* Bathroom is pretty good, though the placement of the shower mixer is just weird
* Interesting stairs
* This really needs about another 10' in length, you could do a lot more with that space

Pretty interesting, I like the concept, but it's too short and the price is pretty crazy.",TinyHouses,The Boxed Haus Two-Story Shipping Container Home,https://www.reddit.com/r/TinyHouses/comments/521mj5/the_boxed_haus_twostory_shipping_container_home/

I'm looking for recommendations for a simple **responsive** css grid library (forgot to emphasize responsive in title):

* No compile step
* Nested grids
* Column pulls left and right, i.e., column ordering 1/2 on desktop, 2/1 on mobile
* IE 10 is the *supposed* baseline, though I would love it if any grid supported back to IE 9 just as a bit of a safeguard. The project is for enterprise-land.

I want it to be as simple and plain jane as possible for the external dev should they have to work in the css, which they of course will at some point :)

Would love to hear some recommendations I can take a look at tonight and do some prototyping tomorrow.

Again, looking for something simple.

Considering this via the current steam summer sale, wondering if those who have this can help me out with some questions.

First, let me say that I **loved** Skyrim, best game I've ever played, just loved the absolute shit out of it. Afterwards, I bought Oblivion and really enjoyed that, too.

So on the right side of the Tamriel page/url above, it says:

*Requires 3rd-Party Account: Elder Scrolls Online Account*

Which looks like I just go to https://account.elderscrollsonline.com/ and create an account.  **Questions:**

* **It looks like this is free, is this correct? I don't want to end up in a monthly subscription model to do any online play**. I do see elsewhere on the page (towards the top right) ""No game subscription required"".
* **What's the purpose of this account?**

The steam page also has two versions of Tamriel:

* Tamriel Unlimited ($20)
* Tamriel Unlimited Imperial Edition ($30)

But they don't seem to explain what the difference between them is.  [From a quick google search it looks like Imperial edition gives you](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:Knight_of_Camlorn/Elder_Scrolls_Online:_Imperial_Edition):

*the ability to play as a member of the Imperial race. This means that you will be able to play as an Imperial in any of the three alliances, and that armor and weapons will have a distinctive Greco-Romanesque design, which extends to crafted items. Also, players will be given a unique white horse ('cough' Shadowfax 'cough') mount and a Mudcrab vanity pet. Finally, Players will be allowed to 'marry' other players, so to speak: They can choose to bind themselves to each other and receive significant XP bonuses while they are in a group together.*

Which sounds like a bunch of bullshit for $10.  **Question: would you guys concur this really isn't worth an extra $10?** Is there any compelling reason to get the Imperial Edition?

From the brief game description it says:

*Explore the vast world with friends or embark upon the adventure alone - the choices you will make will shape your destiny. No game subscription required.*

**Question: Does this mean Tamriel can be played entirely offline (like Skyrim) or can you only play so much, then you have to play the rest online?**  One of the things I loved about Skyrim/Oblivion is not having to worry about online trolls. While I would definitely check out the online play, I would really like to see the same type of offline/Skyrim play, meaning **long game play of constant non-linear discovery**.",gaming,Questions re: The Elder Scrolls® Online: Tamriel Unlimited (current steam summer sale),https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/4pk96o/questions_re_the_elder_scrolls_online_tamriel/

I've been looking for something like this (live home security monitoring with no subscription costs), was wondering if anyone is using this and can speak about it.

I don't really care about facial recognition, I'm more interested in good quality video, live monitoring and no subscription costs.

[Netatmo’s product page](https://www.netatmo.com/product/camera) is down for me at the moment.

Just received the black pair in the photo, brand new and I could barely even get my feet in them. Compared them to other size 10s I have and they're clearly not the same size (see photo).  Here are the specs:

**Black** (all label info is under the tongue)

* 8 UK
* 42 EU
* 10 US L
* Made in Vietnam
* AW004
* GV10P

**Brown** (printed inside on the right side)

* Made in England
* 1561/59
* Size 10
* AW004

I also have 3 other pairs of boots, size US 10, two pairs are UK (labels not legible at this point, they're from the late 90s), one is modern/Chinese where I just noticed it has two US sizes.  My Chinese boot labels (printed underneath the tongue) reads:

* 9 UK
* 10 US M
* 43 EU
* 11 US L
* Made in China
* AW004
* GC001

Why do my Chinese boots have two US sizes?

The Chinese boots were advertised as US 10 and they fit great, just like my two UK boots and the UK brown shoes pictured.  The black shoes from Vietnam seem to be a size down, not a 10. What happened here? Anyone have this problem before? I'm wondering how I can avoid this in the future as I tend to buy them online out of convenience.",BuyItForLife,Doc Marten made in Vietnam size 10 not UK size 10?,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/4n8ivj/doc_marten_made_in_vietnam_size_10_not_uk_size_10/

I'm looking for recommendations for Garage Band-like software for Windows 7. I know **absolutely nothing** about home recording software, have just watched some Garage Band youtube videos and done a little googling. I've found the following:

* [Mixcraft](http://www.acoustica.com/mixcraft/)
* [Traction](https://www.tracktion.com/)
* [Studio One](http://studioone.presonus.com/)
* [Audacity](http://audacityteam.org/)

I'm looking to do hobby music creation via guitar. **Total amateur hour**, real emphasis on hobby music creation. Ideally, I want to get to a point where I can collaborate with others around the world, but that's long-term goal stuff.

Garage Band looks sweet in that you just plug in, record and you can change the amps you're playing through after-the-fact, lay down a bass track with an acoustic guitar, drop in sample drums, all that jazz.

Wondering if you all can recommend the easiest and most powerful way to get started on Windows 7 with doing this kind of stuff.

Links to software demo videos are much appreciated. [This Garage Band tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNCAGYENNc8) is what I'd like to start out doing. Basically the guy creates a simple song with nothing but an acoustic guitar.",homerecording,Looking for Garage Band-like software for Windows 7,https://www.reddit.com/r/homerecording/comments/4214mo/looking_for_garage_bandlike_software_for_windows_7/

Never heard of UPS Mail Innovations, but it shows tracking info when I log into my ups.com account. Googled said service and got:

*UPS Mail Innovations shipments are first picked up at our fulfillment center by UPS. The package is then handed off to your local USPS hub where they sort and process the package. The USPS will then deliver the package directly to your shipping address*

Some questions for anyone who might have some insight.

* Do you think these are real Oris watches or reproductions/fakes?
* What sort of routine servicing would watches like these need and in what frequency and cost?
* General thoughts on these?
* Is this a particular design style/movement? Know of other makers that did this style?

Again, I love the clean design and colors on some of these, wouldn't mind picking up 2 or 3 of these since they're rather inexpensive. If they only last a couple years each, no worries.

2 emails to customer service have gone unanswered (it's been 7 days, 5 biz days now) and I never heard back from the supposed IT reviewing my invoice.

This was for a kilo I paid $100 premium on as well.

**Update 9-23-15**: APMEX has responded to one of my emails (note: I don't use reddit as a communication mechanism with them):

*After reviewing our system and finding your communication the full story of the issue has become more clear. When you purchased the product on 8/31, we unknowingly had an inventory discrepancy; the item then went on pre-sale because of this issue.*

Also want to point out in their email back:

*also send you a free Silver round and $25 gift card towards a future purchase for the inconvenience this has caused*

I honestly don't care about this (but I know others here would be interested in this info), all I wanted was an honest explanation, which isn't hard and which I feel they did provide.

I'd like to take some action to protect that $ from the possibility of a [Cyprus-style bail-in](http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/07/29/bank-of-cyprus-depositors-lose-savings/2595837/) as well as possibly [Greece](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3188638/Greece-lenders-need-bank-recapitalisation-year-end.html).  It's $240k because I'm pretty sure when I looked into the Federal Insurance on credit unions, it was $250k, which came via Dodd-Frank.

I know, it probably sounds doom and gloom and paranoid, but humor me here.  I'm thinking of at least spreading the $ out across 3 separate banks where the account balances are divided equally around $80k each. The idea there is to stay under 100k as the Cyprus bail-in was on 100k+ euro accounts. I could always add a 4th or 5th bank/credit union and spread the money out more.

I'm also actually looking to buy some land (with the goal to retire/build on) which I will pay cash for so I want to retain some cash liquidity. I have various retirement accounts going as well, so I'm not really looking to tie up/commit this $ outside of land.

I would love to hear your thoughts on how to protect myself from any sort of bail-in/economic disaster.

Decent deals. I'm in the market for the gold eagle (or buff), but I'm holding out hoping for better prices.

I also saw a 1oz palladium CML on Bay Precious Metals ebay if anyone is looking.  Don't know if it's a decent deal, just the first time I noticed them selling palladium.

Anyone know of any other deals this weekend? If so, please list them up.
