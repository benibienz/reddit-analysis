Maps probably are the hardest thing to make. And although they have Source 2 I guess they still have to tweak maps to make them look good after patches. That is legit reason to make them expire since with each new map skin they will have to update them all. And after few compendiums they will have shitload of additional work to do. That is the most reasonable explanation for me of why they did that this way. 

It seems that they need to find a better way to sell them. And I guess this is their an attempt to find one. But I still don't like it that map I paid for will expire. 

However if it's ""we don't want to make next compendiums seem to have less value since players will already have plenty of maps"" or ""we eventually run out of ideas for new maps"" then absolutely no compassion for Valve.

82,"I love the idea. There could be more curators:

* Lack of proper mouse+keyboard support (necessity to use controller, not supporting split screen with mouse+keyboard and one controller, stuff like that).

* Always online DRM on games with single player component (you can play some of the games on steam in off line but not with all games).

* Mod support outside steam workshop. (there are some games who don't have steam workshop but support mods anyway, instead of shaming lack of mod support we should show the ones who support it)

* Free soundtrack (some games give it away for free and that is awesome)

I wanted to do this from the very beginning of playing with item icons. Finally figured out how to make it look decent.
