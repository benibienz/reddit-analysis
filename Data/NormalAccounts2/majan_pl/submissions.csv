But it seems to me that new low ammo sound is trying to change that by encouraging people to reload their weapons more often. It could add different and potentially interesting dynamic to reloading. I can see scenarios where you want to reload just because you don't want people to hear you are low on ammo (low ammo sound is louder than reloading). They can use low ammo info to jump on you. And you might want to prevent that by earlier reloading.

I don't know if it is good (it certainly makes no sense when speaking about realism) but I think that is the reason they have added it.",GlobalOffensive,"""You should never reload"".

Although I can see people wanting to have default mini map even with custom terrains and rivers, so some new options could be useful then (separate for terrains and rivers).

But they also block path for themselves at the same time. Similar to how bunkers work in starcraft.

What I'm suggesting is an option to deconstruct buildings by engineer. He would do that the same way he builds them. So if he wants to disable his dispenser we would have to hit 4 and then 2. And to activate it again he would have to click 4 and then 2 again. It would make the building deactivated (no healing/shooting/teleporting) but it still would have the same health. Deactivation should be instantaneous but reactivation should take similar time to redeploying, hitting it with wrench could speed up the process.

They would be less visible and have smaller hitbox so maybe deactivated/deconstructed buildings should still make some quiet noise since it could be used to hide some buildings. Which is seems like cool option but imo countering it by being aware of sounds is reasonable enough.

Also there is benefit for the spy! Yes his Red-Tape Recorder would destroy deactivated buildings instantaneously! Seems like nice perk for an underutilized unlock.
