2,"Javier's style has changed a lot over the years between his early days with Geraldine (more flamboyant and showy) and the present period.  This is not surprising, as the embrace is a part of the whole scaffolding that derives from how tall each partner is (relative to each other), how much lean forward vs how much bracing on the back, and how the shape of each body fit together.  Geraldine also did a lot of embellishment, many of which require leaning on the man, and a square embrace allows the man to support the woman.

Generally Javier's embrace is very flat but remember he has a very slim and tall body shape, no dance student should think he can copy Javier's embrace if you don't shape like him.  With rounder bodies, you may have to use V-shape embrace to maintain connection.

4,"Interesting coding project!  Is it going open source?  I think the concept of the project has one big false assumption, and that is that the music playlist chosen by DJs contains the optimal choice of songs by similarity.  Let's examine that:

* Most DJs are trained to put songs in a tanda that are from the same orquestra and same recording period.  Thus every tanda is already similar, by definition.

* Most DJs are also trained to contrast the mood from tanda to tanda, following the ""increase tension, release tension"" paradigm.  So adjacent tandas will necessarily show difference and not similarity.

* Finally, in the rare case that DJs cluster a group of tracks from different orchestra and era, that could be a valid indication of track similarity (from a DJ's subjective perception).  Sometimes I do that on Vals or Milonga tandas.

DJ's work deals with both similarity and contrasts.  The best DJs sequence his work like a director manages his scenes: he has a story to tell through the music.  

What this app shows me is a social graph that links song tracks by their popular clustering in tandas, a task that is not very difficult if they come from the same orchestra and recording year.  

It misses out the position of the track (first second third or last in the tanda), which is actually a very important clue for DJs -- I always put the strongest in the beginning position.",2016-09-18 23:08:38+00:00,d7sezqa,1.0,t3_53b5ub,58805,tango

8,"If you wish to make your own Internet you need to find a nearby network (which is already connected to the Internet) and negotiate a data gateway arrangement with it.

This arrangement is usually with recurring payment, as the gateway network passes its operating and upstream costs to you as a customer.  

You also need to obtain a block of IP addresses from an organisation known as NIC (a part of IANA), which allocates permanent IP assignments.  In the past most universities and large MNC are able to request big chunks.

You need to have 1 or more high speed trunk channels to connect you and the peering network, normally this is at least megabit or gigabit fibre.  One trend is for everyone to move their network gateways into the same telecom data centres so the distance is shorter between each cabinet.

The gateway protocols that make two networks into parts of the Internet is standardized. Most organisations use Cisco or some optimised routing hardware as there are millions of IP packets that need to route each second.

So in conclusion it is possible for any organization, with enough money and technical skill, and the patience and justification to apply for various network allocation processes, to become an extension of the Internet.  ",2016-09-18 05:51:58+00:00,d7rhemm,1.0,t3_539y59,19476,explainlikeimfive

Who was Maria Cecilia ""Tati"" Caviglia, the woman who was found burned in a suitcase?

09/08/2016 18:11 pm

She had disappeared on August 25 and the next day his body appeared calcined in a suitcase on Route 2. Just today the could identify.

Maria Cecilia ""Tati"" Caviglia , 50, is the woman who appeared burned in a suitcase on Route 2 on August 26. They had reported her disappearance the day before.

Tati Caviglia was the owner of the hostel ""La Casa de Tati"" located at 1636 Independence Avenue, in San Cristobal.

It was an amateur teacher of tango. In fact, the hostel also functioned as ballroom tango and is a favorite for the Buenos Aires milonga habitues of places.

In the hostel he lived with Ezequiel Victor Blanco, a maintenance man with whom he had an affair. Today is the prime suspect for two issues: nothing is known of his whereabouts and place found bloodstains and signs of a struggle.

14,"Good observation Karen as usual.  I would even say that Tango's freedom to express as an anti-pattern during the learning phase, because it excuses too many lousy execution as just a choice or style.  

In fact, in the first three years of tango learners need to have clear and measurable yardsticks of progress.  It is not enough to say someone is dancing well, it needs to be deeply critiqued as dancing without enough phrasing, too much tension in the arm, lack of use of space etc.  

This type of critique comes from the third eye of the teacher, so it is not just doing more practicas, but actually more private lessons.  If money is not object, I strongly recommend it.  The third eye need not be a famous maestro either, just a good experienced teacher who is willing to speak honestly.

What I see instead is the widespread use of Practicas and Milongas as the way to improve.  ""Just dance enough and things will be fixed over time; if they are not fixed then it is not your style.""  The biggest lies in Tango.

Practicas are usually a waste of time unless you are dancing with a more experienced partner.  You also need a plan of attack.  And a video camera.  And measure yourself against specific qualities you want to achieve, e.g. smooth, rhythmic, dancing on a tile.

15,"I think it is simplistic to assume public domain and open metadata will just happen on the current trajectory.  First is that the music corporations like Sony (which owns most BMG and Victor labels recordings) will never stop asserting ownership, unless Government overrides it.  The Argentine copyright act used to be 50 years but it is increasingly likely to be aligned with US and Euro status, which will extend to 70 and possibly 120 years.

Metadata don't collect themselves.  Why is it you can find hundreds of popular music lyrics and song ID services, but not a few reliable tango music lyrics and song ID services?  Because to curate metadata is a job, and the payoff for tango is negligible.  

Tango.info's music database was collected by DJs in EU, and the project is now in ""crowdsource"" mode, but without a paid editor or developer the project cannot reach a useful state for the average tango music collector as it lack API access (OpenDB) or front end UI.

I think a way forward is for the copyright fees currently paid by DJs, teachers and festivals to be channelled into projects rather than into the pocket of ASCAP (and which may or may not arrive in Argentina).   These monies are a recurrent and dependable funds which can support multi-year curation efforts.

There used to be a Russian blog with full album archives, and it also appears to have disappeared recently.

Eight years is a long time on the web, and I have known very few tango-specific blog or database to last that long.  

Sometimes the author lost interest, other times they reach the end of their hosting or domain lease, and could not find justification to renew.  Tragically sometimes people die and sites are left to fallow.

That is why I think it is high time for a cooperative effort to salvage and preserve the recent history of tango.  

Even with UNESCO World Heritage status, the proper care of Tango heritage depends not on the governments of Argentina and Uruguay, but on support of patrons of the arts around the world with money and time.

22,"I learned ballroom salsa and swing before I started tango.  My experience is that tango is a completely different animal.

In martial arts there is a distinction between ""external"" forms and ""internal forms"".  The external form martial arts (shaolin, wingchun) focus on shapes and movement.  The internal form martial arts focus on state of mind and energy control (taiqi, qigong).

Ballroom swing and salsa are the equivalent of external forms.  Tango is the equivalent of internal forms.

This is why people who don't understand tango are always asking to learn ""another move"" while the teacher always ask the student to ""listen to another song"".

My conclusion after decades of studying tango, is that the correct sequence is this:

* Learn the music first.  It's immaterial that it is not happy music, just think of it as a mood you are immersing yourself in, and use the accents and musical moments as your metronome.

* Learn to walk without tension or momentum.  You walk forward and sideway, strongly or softly, quick or slow.  The mood you have collected in step 1 controls step 2 organically.

* Learn to coordinate with the partner inside the embrace.  Timing lead and signals must be split second accurate to avoid uncoordination.  Again step 1 and 2, fully understood, makes step 3 possible.

* Now learn sequences but break them into tiny pieces of max 3 or 4 steps.  Steps are ineffective if they don't move in perfect harmony with the music.  Of course step 1-3 are key to achieving 4.

* Finally, non-steps (adornos) are the personality to make the dance unique.  They work best when you do them without thinking, like an organic gesture reflecting a feeling.

When I first started tango I fought my teacher's pathway.  I was conceited to believe that since I have already learned 12 dances I can learn tango in a matter of weeks.  

That turned out to be completely wrong.  I ate humble pie and yielded to my teacher's suggestions to begin from the start again, starting with the mind understanding the music.   

A beginner's mind (shosin) is precious, and it opens all possibilities and removes all obstacles from pride and assumption.",2016-08-11 03:19:35+00:00,d6crwr5,1.0,t3_4wts6x,176940,tango

24,"Music before the era of radios and recordings, depended on musicmakers.  Who where and how they play became the genre.  

Not everyone who came to the ""New Worlds"" are artists, most of them were laborers and craftsman; others came because of natural diasaster, wars, family reunions etc.  We can speculate that the musicians who end up in the port cities are a small number compared to the population of migrants.

Nevertheless the demand for entertainment still existed.  Rich people pay for live music and throw parties, poor people have their weekly market fairs.  Musicians have to continue to produce music to earn this money.  

Again we can speculate that the close proximity of different ethnic communities could have led to musician ensembles that are formed from different musical heritage.  Klezmer (jewish) musicians playing with Polka with Spanish with Italian etc.  The pool of talents was small, so mixing and sharing ensemble work is normal.

As others have pointed out in the history lessons, various societal forces led to Anglo-saxons and Africans mainly ending up in North America and East European and Latinos ending up in South America.

So both tango and jazz are mongrel music developed from mixing up genres and classical styles.  They both developed in the turn of the century and rose to their strongest popularity in the 40s.  They both transitioned from big bands into small ensembles after the 50s.

Why is tango sad and jazz happy?  I think this big difference is due to the way the Argentinian psyches are different from the American one.  Just generalising with a broad stroke, Argentinians, despite being Latinos, are very serious and introspective, unlike the typical Brazilian Mexican or Carribean.  They are neither fully Italian, Spanish or German, but acquired a little trait of each. And despite the French love for tango, there isn't much French in the Argentinians. The main patrons for Tango music is the lower society stratas and the music reflects the daily grinds.

The New Yorkers also had a mixture of nationalities in their musical growth, but it had a lot of African influence, and ragtime was a big part of the musical landscape due to the growth of vaudeville theatres and the import of French revues.  The music was mainly enjoyed by rich society patrons to be a fantasy of escape and oppulance, and this encouraged the musicians to lift their inspiration towards grandeurs and wilderness.

Interestingly during the 40s there was a period of diplomacy between USA and Argentina, and many musicians made cross-border collaboration.  Astor Piazzolla lived in New York as a child, and Dizzy Gillispie recorded with Fresedo.",2016-08-01 06:12:22+00:00,d5zacaj,1.0,t3_4vht51,48913,tango

[Gancho Pasajero - definition](http://www.verytangostore.com/tango-terms/tango-gancho.html) : ""is a hook (gancho) that is executed on the way to another step. The working leg appears to wrap over the partner's leg while hooking, then releases and proceeds to the next step""

[Serpentina - definition](http://www.tangology101.com/main.cfm/title/Serpentina-\(Reverse-Sacadas\)/id/1020) : ""A Reverse Sacada, Serpentina means snake like, because it looks like two snakes intertwined.""

A Gancho Pasajero is a variant of Gancho like Gancho Doble, Gancho Montada, Self Gancho etc.  All Ganchos are ""Interceptions"", they interrupt the path of one leg to effect the hook.  To achieve this as a leadable step, they need to make contact higher near the knee, and the contact must be maintained during the hook.

Serpentina looks a lot like Gancho Pasajero, but the clue is that it is called Sacada and not Gancho.  Sacadas are ""Displacements"" of positions, there is no need to maintain extended contact between legs, and the contact point is lower, between ankle and calf.

If you watch Clint's demo of Serpentina it would be obvious the direction where he insert his foot is near the lower part of woman's legs, and he does not maintain contact of the knee afterwards.  That is why this is actually a Sacada and not a Gancho.

**Tango is already an ally in the treatment of various diseases**

By Buena Vibra

Tango Therapy is here.  To help treat cardiac events to depression, to Parkinson's disease and other ills.

During the Third International Congress of Tangoterapia, held in Buenos Aires recently, various experimental results were made available for sharing and discussion. 

It appears the Dance that made Buenos Aires famous is an excellent ally in the treatment or alleviation of the symptoms of many common diseases and afflictions.

The benefits are many, experts say. Among the elderly, the rhythm of ""two by four"" is synonymous with healthy aging, since the movements of this dance reinforce the postural balance and help in the rehabilitation of coronary ailments. 

Several studies have shown that patients recover faster, many patients no longer need medication and reduce disability.

Dr. Federico Trossero, clinical psychiatrist and rosarino psychoanalyst and author of the book and website ""Tangoterapia"" explains: ""Its therapeutic action lies mainly in the intensity and depth of the emotions aroused by the tango when you dance and listen to music or poetry. "" 

""We have experimental proof that the tango interaction with couple and group helps the patient connect with their feelings of difficulties or conflicts, and this helps them overcome the barriers of personal development and leads them to pursue a life full of achievements and enjoyment,"" he says.

During the international meeting, the president of the congress cardiologist Roberto Schena gave updates of several experiments.  ""We are taking the first steps to understand with greater intensity which tangoterapia means. We want, as has happened with dance therapy, for this field to become a career and a health discipline. ""

Favaloro Foundation Research also showed that the tango ""is very effective in the rehabilitation of coronary patients in whom suffered a stroke, and high blood pressure.""

Psychologist Rosa Sosnitsky discovered the power of tango when, in his other role as a singer, went to nursing homes to perform to patients. When investigating the influence of music on memory recall, he noticed that the elderly ""had greater involvement with tango music, because it had been set in their memory at an early age. If they did not speak, they began to speak to and remember lyrics. Later, those people progressed in communication. 

""Those who had it danced young and now were afraid of falling, dared to do so, because the embrace gives containment and security,""  he said.

Experts say to enhance the therapeutic benefits of tango you have to choose those that are not depressant, with positive themes such as friendship, love of the mother, the neighborhood, etc.

More diseases in which tango has power to improve the patient:

* Depression: Encourages patients to have a social activity, with more feeling of security than conventional physical activities.

* Spasticity and Parkinson 's disease: Increase agility and strength movements and thereby strengthens the balance.

* Cardiac disease and hypertension: hormones related decreases sympathetic activity (which produce tachycardia, hypertension and vasospasm), and improves vascular capacity.

* Sensory Degeneration: Dancing, listening and interpreting the tango helps in the mechanism of expression of emotions.

* Schizophrenia: As emotional pathology distorts body image, and therefore communication, tango gives a structure and helps in the development of body image and communication.

In addition, both dancing improves self-esteem. It is an excellent way to develop self-awareness, become aware of our body and balance training. What's more, the link with the other dancer and body communication help to be more perceptive to the environment and contribute to increasing the erotic sensitivity.

Closures, rate hikes are a lethal cocktail for milongas

published 21/06/16
 
This week, coinciding with the arrival of Winter, is the fourth edition of the ""Marathon Milonguera"" -- a week-long festival of all the milongas under AOM (Association of Milonga Organiser) umbrella.  

The festival ticket is $180peso for unlimited entries to all the milonga -- a steal, since regular admission to one milonga is not less than $80peso.

Julio Bassan, AOM head and organizer of Club Fulgor, says this is a a key week of the year.  ""We are in low tourist season from the cold, flu, utilities rate hikes, the locals are not enough to fill the rooms.  This is usually the worst week of the year in terms of attendence.""

What the AOM has offered is a good deal to attract people to explore the milongas with friends who might not normally venture into the circuit.

AOM recently published an open letter in the Clarin newspaper to protest the forced closure of milonga spaces, and the lack of a public policy to protect this sector of the economy.

The recent increase in utility rates has also hit the neighborhood clubs hard.  ""It is $10,000peso bill just for the lights, and I am forced to cut employees and suppliers to pay water bills and gas."" says Norma Firpo who runs the Sunderland Club restaurant, which was closed by the city for three months for failing fire inspection.

""The last closure is ruining us because without milonga there is no consumption in the buffet. The last inspection meant a fine of $100,000peso, the Club was already catching up. And new fire safety modifications mean more costs have to be spent in fitting. In the meantime, I do not know how we will survive,"" she adding that they hope to reopen the milonga later in the winter months.

In response to several street protests, the national government announced a subsidy of 40% on utility charges for clubs that have up to 2000 members.  And another government initiative provides seed funding to encourage commercial users to switch to energy-saving LED lighting.

Meanwhile, milonga remains the best remedy for all these evils! ",2016-06-28 19:41:45+00:00,d4rm03e,1.0,t3_4qb74w,1813,tango

Blind Tango, a different experience
published 06/10/16
 

Walking through the neighborhood of Abasto Friday sun, passing through the corner of Ciego Teatro and graffiti Gardel smiling stamped on the corner of Zelaya and Jean Jaures, I recalled that some time ago a friend invited me to dance tango in the dark .

Photo Gza the Journal of Ibón Casas

Many years ago we used to see in some milongas, as Dandy and La Ideal, a blind stranger with whom all women wanted to dance, for their kindness and for his amazing ability to recognize space to move and intuit steps neatly, without stepping on anyone and far from those dramatic moves that popularized the character of Al Pacino in Scent of a woman. Currently the circuit tracks are full of people who see but do not see the other, which does not respect the formula of the sense of clockwise, which is almost the same.

Currently in the Teatro Ciego give different tango classes because they develop in a totally darkened dance track, allowing greater concentration and connection between the dancers. The challenge is to refine the feeling and make it translates into energy capable of powering the movement of dance. Is guided by teachers adventure also proposes introduce codes of the milonga from a more perceptive and less visual (the base of tango really) place, while allowing us to understand the dimension of this difficulty suffering from certain people, which is not in no way a disability. Being an innovative classes do not distinguish levels, nor is it necessary to have previous experience or attend a couple, say teachers and Giuliana Fernández Pablo Ugolini. Experience has its romantic, clear side. ",2016-06-13 18:56:07+00:00,d47o1zo,2.0,t1_d476rb2,25333,tango
82,"It always pains me to hear that a beginner gives up going to salon because of the problems generated by other dancers, particularly: being judged, having to bring their ""A"" games, and generally treating it as an ordeal instead of a fun time.

It is true that people going to a milonga is demanding.  Their time is limited, and there is an opportunity cost with each and every person they choose to spend time with.  

Usually, the etiquette of milonga means they get only one try with each candidate; so if they choose wrong (or simply picked the wrong song to dance a challenging piece with someone who is not able to keep up) the tanda is lost.

Of course not everyone is like that.  At any milonga, you can reliably depend on these people to share a dance: the hosts, the deejays, the other beginners (you have to spot them), and there are kind and generous partners (you also have to spot them) who will dance with even the most inept walkers without judging.

So you see the milonga is really like a jungle of predators and preys, all eyeing each other and running calculations in their head of who when where and how to pounce.


Think of people in a milonga like people driving in the highway at rush hours.  Most people are trying to move along quickly and efficiently, they are in no mood to chaperon beginner drivers, and if they spot one the instinct is to get around him.  The mental state of a beginner is not really suited to deal with high-pressure driving (like jams and parking) --- but what is the path towards becoming a better driver?  You got it, only by driving more in high stress situations.",2016-06-13 18:50:42+00:00,d47nsgv,,t1_d479g21,19306,tango

Carta del Editor

Estimado a amigo a lector a:

Esta es una carta de despedida.  La que está leyendo será la última edición impresa de esta revista.

El motivo para discontinuar esta publicación es que desmejoró 
la relación entre los ingresos por avisos -- única fuente de ﬁnanciación -- y los costos de editarla. Son tiempos difíciles y no vislumbro que esto vaya a cambiar en el futuro próximo.

La cantidad de anuncios pagos que se publican ha venido 
bajando durante los últimos años. Nunca fui a pedir subsidios a funcionarios públicos, ni tengo experiencia ni conocimientos para hacerlo.

Por el otro lado, los costos de impresión, de diseno, de distribución y los gastos genera les han venido creciendo sin cesar.

En resumen: los números no cierran.

Esta decisión la conversé con Amalia Fernández, con quien comenzamos esta publicación en 1995, y desde hace unos años está radicada en Melbourne (Australia) acompañando a sus hijos, 
nietos y biznietos.  Ella me aconsejó “Pienso que es hora que dejes de hacer la revista, y te dediques al canto y a estudiar, tenés que disfrutar la vida ... con lo que a vos te gusta leer, ver alguna 
ópera en el Colón, un espectáculo de jazz, más bailar tango, cantar, estudiar música, cocinar, mandados, lavar y planchar, ¡ah,
y escribirl, también viajar. Vos podés viajar a los eventos de tango y sacar fotos, que lo haces muy bien ... ¿qué tal? No creo que te quede mucho tiempo libre”.

Como siempre, ella está muy asentada en la realidad y sus ideas son prácticas, simples y eﬁcaces.

Le cuento que estos años 22 que estuve haciendo periodismo
han sido los más felices de mi vida. Recibí una gran cantidad de satisfacciones. En primer lugar, de lectores que me han expresado 
de alguna manera el placer que han sentido por tener esta revista
en sus manos. Luego, los múltiples reconocimientos de organizadores e instituciones, las obras de reconocidos artistas plásticos, qu han estado presentes en las distintas ediciones. 
Finalmente, cuando buscando en la Web encontré en el canal de noticias CNN que entre las miles de actividades que una pareja de enamorados podría hacer en Buenos Aires el Día de San Valentín, 
les recomendaba tomar una clase de tango y, para ello, consultar la revista editada por Tito Palumbo. Me mencionaban con nombre y apellido. ¡Se me cayeron los pantalones de la emoción cuando leí esa nota! (la puede ver en la página de enfrente).

El éxito de esta revista es mérito de muchas personas que me han acompañado en estos 21 años. Sus nombres están en las listas de colaboradores que ﬁguran en cada edición, más los diseñadores gráﬁcos, los talleres gráﬁcos, los conductores de vehículos que me han transportado durante la distribución. Los anunciantes que, como dije antes, ﬁnanciaron todos los costos. Los distintos medios que ayudaron con la mención de nuestra presencia. También suyo, que recibió un ejemplar, se adueñó de él y, en ocasiones, cuando nos cruzamos en algún sitio, me alentó con unas palabras. Soy el único responsable de los errores cometidos y de las fallas que usted pueda haber encontrado.

Esta revista nació para llenar un tremendo vacío informativo en la ciudad donde había nacido el tango. Para saber dónde ir a tomar
clases o practicar o bailar la guía era la información que iba de boca en boca. Ningún medio gráﬁco, ni radial, ni televisivo daba
noticia de esas actividades.

Después de un año de experiencia colaborando en la revista 
Vea Más Espectáculos, la invité a Amalia Fernández para hacer una
publicación propia. Así fue que en la primera quincena de 1995 
apareció ""B.A. TANGO - Buenos Aires Tango, Guía y Agenda Porteña"". Eran cuatro páginas -- una hoja plegada --. De allí en más nos fuimos ampliando; acompañamos el crecimiento del interés de mucha gente por el baile.

Fuimos la primera publicación gráfica que le dio un lugar destacado a los bailarines de tango. La primera, después de cuarenta años, que logró reunir en una página avisos de distintas milongas.

Ahora que me retiro siento que va a quedar un vacío difícil de llenar. No creo que puedan escribirse notas como las que yo he publicado, con opinión fundada. Que se hagan investigaciones y denuncias como las que aparecieron en muchas ediciones. Y, seguro, no existirá un periodista tanguero que se presente ante la
Iusticia para denunciar la posible comisión de un delito por parte de funcionarios públicos como yo lo hice.

Probablemente, continúe escribiendo notas y  tomando fotos que publicaré en el Facebook.

Y, con más empeño, seguiré bregando para lograr que se sancione la Ley ProMilonga, cuyo proyecto está desde hace dos años en
manos de las autoridades de la Asociación de Organizadores de Milongas.

Lo dejo con un cálido y estrecho abrazo tanguero. Guárdeme en su memoria.

Con un abrazo tan uero de 

TITO PALUMBO, Editor

(ENGLISH TRANSLATION) Letter from the Editor

To dear friend reader:

This is a farewell letter. You are reading the last printed edition of this magazine.  The reason to discontinue this publication is the worsened relationship between ad revenue - the only source of funding - and the costs of editing.  These are difficult times and we do not expect this will change in the near future.

The amount of paid ads has been down in recent years.  I never receive subsidy from the State, and I don't want to.  On the other hand, the costs of printing, design, distribution and expenses have 
grown steadily.

In short: the numbers do not balance.

This decision sprang from a conversation with Amalia Fernandez,
who founded the publication with me in 1995, and who has for some years lived in Melbourne (Australia) with her children and grandchildren.  She told me ""I think it's time for you to stop doing the magazine, and dedicate yourself to singing and study, you have to enjoy life ... read, watch opera, jazz, more dancing, cooking, write a book, and travel.  Treasure the remaining time you have left. ""

As always, she was right and practical.

I tell you these 22 years I was doing journalism have been the happiest of my life.  I received a lot of satisfaction.

First, readers who have expressed to me the pleasure they have felt for having this magazine in their hands.

Then, the work of many organizers, institutions, and renowned artists, that have been featured in the past issues.

Finally, when searching the Web I found CNN has written -- in a story about the best couple activities on Valentine's Day -- that they should take a tango class and consult the magazine
edited by Tito Palumbo!

The success of this journal is to the credit of many people who have accompanied me in these 21 years -- their names are on the lists of collaborators printed in each edition.  The designers, the organisers, the drivers who helped me during distribution.  Advertisers -- who, as I said before, financed all the costs.  The various media that helped with the mention of our presence.  The readers who encouraged me with words.  I am solely responsible for errors.

This magazine was created to fill a tremendous information gap in the city where tango was born. To find out where to take or dance classes or practice guide was information that used to be passing by word of mouth.  No radio or TV gave news of these activities.

After a year of experience working in the magazine I invited  Amalia Fernandez to start our own publication.  It was in the first half of 1995 that ""B.A. TANGO - Buenos Aires Tango, Contacts and Calendar Porteña"" was launched.  The first issue was four pages - a folded sheet.  From then on we grew with the growth of the scene.  We were the first publication to focus on tango dancers. 

Now I feel retirement will be a void difficult to fill.  I do not expect to stop writing notes and opinions, and investigations as we did in the past issues.  Public officials will continue to be scrutinized for their actions.  Without the magazine, I will probably publish my notes and pictures on Facebook.

And I will continue to support the Association of Milonga Organisers' struggle with the authorities to fix the Law for professional milongas.

I leave you with a warm and tight hug. Keep me in your memory.

With such a tanguero hug

98,"Teaching tango is a difficult task, but not impossible.

The optimal conditions for learning tango requires three elements:  good teachers (generous, open-minded, systematic), an immersion environment (many organisers bringing in music, performances and festivals), and arenas (practicas and milongas) for observing role-models.  

In other words, the path to understanding tango goes beyond just studying steps and movement.  The teacher merely plant the seed of curiosity; the rest of learning takes place within the student, driving him to explore the immersive environment.  In my opinion, the ratio of effort is close to 30% (teacher) and 70% (student). 

Most people in their first 2-3 years of tango only understand basic mechanics of the dance, but lack deep knowledge of musicality, expression, dynamics, or the history of the musicians.

Like a blind man and the elephant, you can only try to explain what you personally learned from your teacher.  That translates to a single role model, a single style, and a single point of view of what is or isn't good tango.

If you have danced tango for another 3-5 years more, you will be in a better position to explain the styles, choreography, culture, values, etiquette, psychology, group dynamics etc.   You will have seen enough to know what rules are possible to break.

Today, the bulk of pedagogical knowlege about Tango are not curated, peer-reviewed, or commonly shared outside a classroom.  Very few good dancers were able to write down their insights or to explain their movements.  Without a pool of shared knowledge, Tango teachers teach by copying steps, and end up cloning their own limitations into their students.  

Examples of common teacher's fail:

1. Many teachers like to describe tango as ""revealing the secrets"".  This is BS.  There is no secret knowledge, tango today can be coached as scientifically as athletics and gymnastics.  The real difficulty is in measuring progress.

2. When the students want to know how to do something difficult -- like a lift or gancho -- the teacher uses the standard line ""you won't need to learn this step because you will never use it in the milonga"".   This is an example of how the teacher passes his own limitations onto the student.

3. Male teacher teaching both roles without sufficient understanding of the follower's technique. Actually the lead and follow roles are very different, and followers often fail to find their voice in tango, because they never learned how.

In conclusion, we do need more teachers to help spread the passion of tango, even if they only know a little bit.  We should also make a push for better pedagogy and teaching aids.  And one teacher cannot teach everything a dancer needs to know.",2016-05-22 19:45:49+00:00,d3fi3qv,1.0,t3_4kf9bq,84564,tango

102,"Other commenters have given good definitions and I will expand a little more.

In tango there are two primary groups of movements, one group is translation (walking) and the other group is rotation (pivoting).  The axis (centre of rotation) is relevant in most of the second.

When one person is rotating, usually the other person is walking. Without a good understanding of axis it is easy for the movement of one to interfere with the movement of the other:

- if the lead is pivoting on his own, he needs to center his head over his pivoting feet in the correct axis of rotation. Looking down breaks the axis. And he needs to isolate the top and bottom half of the body to generate dissociation, which is the true source of rotation energy.

- if the follower is doing the rotation (like in a Calesita, or a Boleo) the leader must position himself equal distance from the follower's pivoting feet (forming an equal triangle) and use weight shifts to create gentle rotation energy that passes into the pivoting axis.  Most leaders use arm energy to start pivots which is usually also tilting the axis. 

- A complete understanding of the axis is necessary for learning any ""off-axis"" moves, like Volcada, Colgada, and various ""shared-axis"" steps.

In my experience the difficulty of managing the axis is often due to the leaders having to do it on the follower, they fail to deliver good axis on the follower when (1) they don't fully wrap their head around the movement the follower has to do, and (2) they use too much force in their Abrazos.

The solution to both these problems is simple: just practise as a Follower and learn what not to do.",2016-03-20 20:01:19+00:00,d1718gz,1.0,t3_4b6d2n,55941,tango

105,"18) No knowledge of the 1980s teaching boom. Brilliant dancers of the 30s 40s 50s could really dance, but not really teach. The only way they knew was to take on the apprentice and the apprentice would spend a couple of decades learning by copying. Very poor teaching practice but mythologised as something wonderful. Then some dancers with insight investigated what each bario was dancing and formulated an understanding of how tango was danced across the board. They worked out how the structure of the dance worked, then they worked out how it could be taught. Without understanding this, you can have no understanding of the teaching and therefore the learning of how to do this dance. Top level dancers are not born out of mythological methodology but of insight and hard work. 

19) No hard work. There is very little focus on bodywork and dance training in the UK scene. 

20) Inability to fail. Learning means failing. If you want to be good, you have to fuck up. You have to learn from your mistakes. The pressure to succeed stops us becoming top level in many fields not just tango. Attaining high levels is all down to acceptance of your failures and doing something about it. 

21) Lack of practicas. The UK scene seems to be about group classes and milongas, but to get really good you need top level private lessons and plenty of practicas. The UK scene really lacks on this front. Advertised practicas get turned into milongas. What is needed is Guided Practicas, where teachers hover around a practica to give help and advice. 

22) Lack of generosity/ honesty/paternalism. The scene seems too competitive, (without actually going into a competition) and people do not help out others (without large fees). They are not honest in feedback. There is also a lack of the Buenos Aires maestro/father figure who helps out and advises those they think worth the help and advice. Top level dancers need top level wisdom and guidance. 

23) A lack of joy. The scene is far too serious and many dancers lack a sense of joy. Do they really enjoy the tango? Does attaining a high level reduce the passion? 

24) Costs and house prices. This may seem off target, but London house prices are exorbitant compared to many other cities. These costs are spread down to hall hire and therefore milonga costs. In countries with cheaper milongas, more people can dance more often and raise the level of that country's dance. 

25) Other. 

 - a)The tango-marathon trap, a larger elite-building and tango-limiting idea, that has produced its own lazy style of tango.

 - b) Class gangs. The limitation of belonging to a club and dancing only with that club, repeating the mistakes of that club, and believing the tenets of that club. 

 - c) Facebook and other boards' criticisms and lack of insight and knowledge, spreading bullshit, revisionism and self referential ideas of what tango is and should be, also limit the thinking of the country's tango scene and limit the possibility of a real top level dancer or set of dancers to evolve. 

All this being said, there is still a Potential to allow the Potential of some dancers to discover their own Potential. At the moment it is POTENTIAL only. 

More insight and less ego is needed from these dancers, and more support offered from within the scene.",2016-02-23 17:09:16+00:00,d0ari6a,2.0,t1_d0are7t,151,tango
106,"The original post in case FB restricts it:

Mark Phoenix: ""In another post Brigit asks, Why are there no home-grown top level dancers in the UK. I had so much to say, that fb wouldnt accept my post. So I post as my own discussion. Bridget raises a very interesting question. It moves us away from the usual 'tango is about people just enjoying a milonga', discussion. 

There is no home-grown top level dancer in the UK, let alone dancers plural. Something we should be ashamed of. Not to recognise it, is even more shaming. There is no simple answer but a combination of causes. I will list some here and explain. 

1) A lack of intelligence/ insight. People are unaware of themselves and their own abilities, unaware of what it is that makes good dancing, and an inability to see what it is that others are doing in their dance. A superficiality is all that is noticed. People are fooled by the smoke and mirrors, the illusions of good dancing without being able to see deeper into the dance and physicality of other dancers and hence an inability to see what they need to do to improve. 

2) Ego. People think they are better than they are. People's Egos are greater than their talent. They make assumptions about the people they dance with. They assume that because they dance with someone good, that they are themselves good. They are not, they are just dancing with someone good, or someone that they perceive as good. That perception itself may be wrong. See point 1. 

3) Culture. British culture is not a dance culture, especially for men. Other cultures allow and support men dancing from an early age, but it is the exception rather than the rule for Brits. Also there is the fake adaptation of Argentinian culture. Going to BA and hanging out, does not make a better dancer. It will not make you Argentinian. The Russians and Columbians do not worry about being Argentinian, they work on their dance to a high level rather than trying to gain a new culture. Also there is the culture within the UK tango scene. There are so few natives compared to other nationalities who live in the UK, and as we are very tolerant, we tend to accept foreign influences to drown out our own. The tango scene is very egocentric, see point 2, and although this may not be a British trait, we allow it to fester and dominate the scene. This holds back people of all levels from progressing because of the worry of judgement and the unseen rules of who dances with who. 

4) Not dancing with all levels. An advanced dancer should be able to dance with any level partner. Yet we rarely see those who think they are good dancing with those they think are poor. There is a lot to be learnt from dancing down a level or two. For leaders, to be able to identify the limits of your partner and gently stretch them, and for followers to be able to maintain their own balance/axis no matter how rough the lead. 

5) Elitism. Gangs of dancers who only dance with those they consider good, fail to enrich those 'below' them and limit themselves. Those that ought by now to be good, because they have spent 10 years dancing in the elite club, have shackled themselves to mediocrity. They dont improve because they think they are already good. see point 2. These egotists have killed the scene in the UK for the last decade. They dont improve. Many of them have got worse because of the laziness induced by their egos and the lack of insight into their own and their groups true level. I say again, the ego is bigger than the talent. 

6) Historical Revisionism. To be a good tango dancer, you have to dance the tango and not limit yourself by buying into the historical revisionism that exists in most posts and milonga talk. If you reduce the range of the dance because of a false limitation in understanding it, you wont be able to become top quality in it. If you believe that the development of the dance at the turn of the 1900s was limited to close embrace salon danced only on the open side of the embrace with only simple forward side and back steps, how can you be top level? You limit the idea of the dance and limit your own dance. 

7) There never was, is, or shall be a Golden Age. Nostalgia isnt what it was. The dance has always been developing and changing. There never was a perfect moment of anything. Especially in tango. Being hung up in a past that you were not involved in, holds you back from the present, limits your insight and smothers creativity. Top quality dancers dance like themselves. They dont dance like somebody else. 

8) There is One tango not Three. Salon, Nuevo, Milonguero, are not three separate dances, they are all Tango. To be top level, you must be able to open the embrace, execute figures, find the elegance of shared weight and respond together on your own axis. To do only a third of the Tango will not make you a top level tanguero. 

9) Only dancing half the dance. To dance only on the followers open side is only dancing half the possibilities. The current flavour of a tight left arm of the follower and tight right arm of the leader, desperately holding each other into a 'close' embrace, limits the dance further. 

10) Mimicry. Dance your own dance. Stop trying to be (eg ) Noellia. Its ugly. She dances her dance and she does what she does well. You dont. Dancing like someone else, even top level, is not top level dancing. 

11) Laziness. The current trend in the UK is Lazy Salon. Watch early videos of Zotto and the like. Close embrace, definitely the style we currently think of as Salon, above the waist. but look at those legs, dissociation, torque. Top level dancers are not lazy. 

12) Lack of moves. Revisionism plays its part here. The mistaken idea that the 1900s 1930s 1950s had no figures and moves means that people are trying to dance a mythology of dullness. Most 'moves' we do now were originated in the 'Golden Age'. So if you want to dance as they did in the 30's then work on some figures. You want to spread the mythology? Then you will never be top level. 

13) 10,000 hours and more. To become good at anything you have to put in 10,000 hours. More than that. The joke that someone claims to have 35 yrs experience is countered by "" No, you have had 1 years experience, 35 times"". Make sure your experience grows and is not repeated. 

14) A lack of Improvisation skills. People are obsessed with the rules of tango and have no creativity. They think they are improvising, but more often than not, one typical default step will follow another in every dance. Learn to improvise. Without the ability to truly improvise you cannot be top level. 

15) No real understanding of the dance structure. Top dancers understand the structure of the dance and can adapt, invent, develop the work on their own. Most people in the UK dont understand the structure one bit. They dance as they were taught. They dont understand the concepts that are available to play with.

16) Lack of competition. Until recently there was no way to make a comparison on the world stage of how the UK rates. It will take a while but maybe the yearly UK preliminary will encourage our top dancers to compete. Currently the rest of the world enters their teachers, professionals and very top people into the Mundial. The UK preliminary to the Mundial is currently something only us amateurs enter. Why? Because the teachers/professionals have something to lose. The esteem they hold themselves in. 

17) Poor Teaching. Too many tango teachers know nothing about teaching. Even if they do know something about tango, they lack real communication skills, insight into the subject, analysis of what it is they are teaching, personality, clarity, good English. Many teach mythology and revisionism as part of teaching the dance and thus hold their students back from top level ability. How can we produce top level dancers with mediocre teaching? Where are the top experts? A handful exist only. Too many teachers have no insight and only teach what they were taught and start teaching too early. Three years? Really? To produce top level dancers we need top level teaching. Both with the ability to teach and the ability to break down the tango.

107,"This is an interesting question that needs a complex answers.  

In the very beginning of tango age, there is no structured instruction available, so men learn by copying each other, and practised both lead and follower's role.  In those days men and women did not mix causally so the ladies do not get to learn the dance.  The result is a style of dancing tango where the man held the woman very tightly around the waist, and led their moves very boldly to guide their partners.   If you look at any tango show depicting a scene from the 1890s the dance style will look like that. 

In the next phase of tango from 20s to 50s, the women started to take dance lessons, and as a result the men's leading became more subtle.  It was then possible for a very small signal from the man to be recognised and responded to by the woman.  The style of dancing became softer, quieter, and more elegant.

In the modern age we can still choose to dance soft or strong, depending on how ""clued-in"" the partner is.  If you are dancing with a complete beginner with no prior knowledge of tango, a stronger embrace with stronger, clearer signals will help her do many basic tango walking steps properly.  But if you have an experienced partner, then you can strip away most of the strong muscle energy in your arms, soften the embrace, and let the woman dance within the perimeter of your hold with minimal energy..",2016-02-18 03:57:04+00:00,d0442ty,1.0,t3_46cd12,7171,tango

I would humbly suggest that dancing with someone of a different skill level is an opportunity to learn and not an ordeal to be endured, even if you are the best dancer in the world. 

If you have already committed yourself by accepting the cabeceo, and if you did not do your homework to check out the partner's dancing ability prior to that (why not if you care so much about your partner's dance skill), then the courteous thing to do is suffer to the end of the tanda with a smile.

114,"My sympathies to OP and u/indigo.. as victims of ""unkind partners"".  Sometime back in this subreddit there was much discussion of ""kindness"" in tango and its relevance in keeping a community healthy, and similarly how the absence of such kindness can undermine a small, flegling one.

It is interesting that in both cases the culprits are the more experienced and advanced dancer, or perhaps even a teacher, so there is really no excuse of ignorance.  

I blame the phenomenon on the rise of ""pleasurists"" -- people who subscribe to the ""dance for my own pleasure; all other considerations be damned"" school of thought.

The pleasurists' value is very much aligned with the ""me generation"" of millenials and ""social justice warriors"", where they see everything through a self-centered lens.  If they don't enjoy something, feel uneasy, is offended, or in any way disturbed by their environment, then someone else must be in the wrong.

Fundamentally it is a question of values.  In tango the value transmission chain is somewhat defective from teachers to students.  Learning values from idols or social media is the road to hell.  The result is: the rise of the pleasurists at the expense of civil community builders.

To add insult to injury, the pleasurists are vocal in justifying their actions.  I have read dozens of postings in social media, where the pleasurists ""explain"" why they chose not to dance with someone, or ""warn"" unworthy partners not to expect them to be available for a dance.

116,"A very good question that is deceptively difficult to answer.  That is because I have seen too many people just treat a practica as another type of milonga, except without cortinas, changing partners, and following line of dance.

If your local practicas are like this, then do yourself a favour and go walk 5km with tango in your ipod instead, you will get more out of it.

Without a teacher present, or a guided practica agenda, practice time is regularly wasted.  People keep on repeating their mistakes and fail to correct their weaknesses.

So the easy answer is, if you can find a guided practica instead of a free-form practica, go to that.  The teacher's eyes are the most important feedback you will get, not the chitchat from your partner (does she have a clue what the leader does?).

If you cannot find a guided practica, and have to rely on your own steam, then you should make a practice agenda for each session. Some suggestions:

-- dimension 1. Musicality -- just use walk, pause, sincopation, rebotes, suspension, steps, matching to each piece of music you hear.  You are dancing simply by walking musically, fast and slow, by yourself, without partner.  This is the baseline exercise that you repeat for all the music you will dance to, including the ones that you don't particularly like. Listen to the music, and make the music visual in your steps.

-- dimension 2. Axis exercises -- Tango needs good dissociation in the body and the ability to pivot without losing axis and balance.  A ballet dancer perfects her spins by doing 1000s of them, and so must you.  Practising spins to left and right, single and multiple, and vary them with lapiz/rulo/enrosque/planeo.

-- dimension 3. Improvisation --  the modern tango approach is the ability to follow completely unexpected movements.  What hinders our ability is memorised patterns.  Try doing the mirror image of a turn.  Try to dance without embrace, or in mirror embrace (left and right arms flipped).  Let the woman think of the next step and the man position himself accordingly.  Do a sacada every 8th step.  These are exercises some teachers have used to help break the blinders in your minds.

In such a setup, between a reasonable and an unreasonable person, the reasonable party is already at a huge disadvantage from first step.

Clearly Trump is intentionally moving the goal post far to the right into hardline territory, in order to create a bigger negotiation surface between the two poles.  

Trump's tough position appears shocking, but is really not so different from, say, Putin or Xi Jin Ping's hard line positions, allowing them to inch forward and give in ""a little bit"", and reach compromise, but without actually giving up much in reality.

134,"A nice match between the height of the leader and follower allows the couple to dance easily and use minimal wasted energy; conversely a big mismatch between the height can make even the simplest form of walking challenging.

Average height dancers usually just learn to do one embrace well, and frequently this is the embrace style of their teacher.  But there is a spectrum of possibilities in embrace styles in tango, including open, close, apilado, V-shape, canyengue, and liquid.

Does a dancer who only know one type of embrace have difficulty dancing with partners of the wrong size?  Yes, but usually average height dancers skirt the problem, as they normally have more than enough potential partners to invite.

On the other hand, if you are an outlier in the height department, your best strategy is to learn a variety of embrace, at the minimum an open, closed, and V-shape.  This will give you the greatest flexibility to invite followers regardless they are taller, shorter, or wider.

A plus-size dancer also has to be aware of his techniques: it does not produce the same reaction sending a signal to a follower at shoulder level or another at waist level.

In summary, size-challenged dancers need more training than average dancers, and they need to learn to be more versatile and disciplined -- the result is that they could become the finest dancers.

136,"The question has to be answered in two ways: orchestras that play in the Golden Age style, and orchestras that have recorded in the Golden Age style. The difference is subtle but important.

Orchestras that play in the Golden Age style usually do the circuit of playing live at milonga nights, whether in Buenos Aires or at international festivals.  The most frequently mentioned names include: Solo Tango (Russia), Color Tango (Argentina), Silencio (Switzerland), Sexteto Milongueros (Argentina).

However the milonga configuration may be different from the full orchestra, perhaps with fewer players, or rearranged to fit the lack of certain instruments.

For the second category, it is actually a common theme for orchestras to record an entire album ""in the style of"" a Golden Age master as an homage.  Los Reyes del Tango recorded albums in the D'Arienzo style, Gente de Tango recorded in DiSarli style, and Color Tango recorded in Pugliese style.

So the question of comparing modern orchestras with Golden Age is complicated, because you first need to find opportunities to hear the many contemporary orchestras live -- without a recording.

For most of the world's tango community, DJs are the only channel for them to hear tango dance music.  If tango is to continue as a living art form, it needs to evolve and avoid fossilization.

149,"Hi I am probably not qualified to give advice, as I am just this year getting into frameworks, but I have coded two projects in Laravel and one in Slim, so I have a bit of experience to share.

I want to say that a framework is often confused with a library, but there is a fundamental difference.  A framework is the ""master"" while libraries are ""minions"".  In other words, the flow of control is inverted in a framework.

In the frameworks I have used, you configure the Routing (map a URL path to a function call), and then pass control to the framework.  

- After the framework sorted out the protocol parts (session, security, HTTP action verbs etc), it will make a call into your functions.   Some frameworks can be made to Autoload codes on demand, so you only use what you need for a specific routed call.

- At the end of the page-specific function, you return the values to the framework.  The framework will complete the rest of the page, including protocol, tagging the cache, redirecting, whatever.

By using a framework like Laravel or Slim, I reduce the codes I need to write to a bare minimum.

The caveat is that the framework is like a blackbox, with a lot of the complexity happening ""by magic"".  Poorly documented frameworks make debugging hell.",2015-10-10 23:31:26+00:00,cvv9g7d,1.0,t3_3o58pf,96130,PHP

164,"I am basically in your shoes, trying to apply ""modern"" PHP concepts to solve problems.  Allow me to give you my interpretation.  

A web program that applies OOP achieves two benefits: information hiding and abstraction.

- Information hiding is to remove from view everything not in current use.  

A local variable, class methods, class private functions, namespaces etc. all help to limit the scope of our functions, and keep globals quarantined.  Globals are always dangerous in a web environment because that is how saboteurs try to break our apps.

- Information abstraction is to operate on a nebulous concept directly.

OOP allows you to make assign variables to types like ""stack"", a ""tree"", a ""projectdate"".  The complexity of implementation is pushed into the classes, and we can just import a library and be done.

All programming is a tradeoff between coding complexity and runtime complexity.  OOP increases the latter slightly, but reduces the former and makes it easier to read and maintain old codes.",2015-10-10 19:45:11+00:00,cvv24q9,1.0,t3_3mg4pd,1245555,PHP

173,"Acually there are numerous workshops taught under titles like ""How to decorate to DiSari"" or ""Syncopations with D'Arienzo"", but usually you would only get them in festivals, as these tend to attract experienced dancers.

Why do we care about orchestras?  The short answer is that the big orchestras of tango have strong musical personalities, not unlike how a big director (Hitchcock, Bay, Cameron, Tarantino) is able to stamp his signature onto his films.  

Compare a popular song like La Cumparsita, recorded at least once by every orchestra, and yet it feels completely different between the 20s (Firpo), 40s (D'Arienzo), and 70s (Sexteto Mayor) orchestras.   Or Por Una Cabeza, as recorded on strings (Tango Projects for Scent of a Woman in 80s) and the original version on guitar and vocals by Carlos Gardel in 30s.

A dancer (and a DJ, for the same reason) does not care about the song as much as its interpretation style --- rhythmic, layered, smooth, dramatic, legato or staccato.  And within all versions of that style he may have a favourite interpreter that he likes best because of how he was able to apply his dancing, because it was a hit with the ladies, or because he knows every note of that version of song.

Do I have favourite orchestras?  Yes.  But I don't feel the need to share this information with others.  A musical taste is a very personal thing and only you (together with your history and personality) will know what you like, and there is no need to follow the crowd.

177,"| There's always competition to dance with the people that everyone wants to dance with.  Isn't that enough to motivate people? I felt it pretty intensely --   doesn't everybody? 

Actually no.  The competition you're referring is more of human dynamics; the competition I was referring is more of dance skill.

A beginner may confuse the two and think one implies the other, but an experienced dancer knows better.  There is actually no direct correlation --- with some fantastic dancers you may never click, with others the interaction is delightful even if they are just average dancers.

Also, a teacher can coach you in dance skills, but he cannot help you much in human dynamics.  

In my circle I see many people with excellent dance skills and dancing more than 10 years, dropping out of the tango one by one, solely because of human problem: perhaps fewer ask them to dance, since they are not the young and pretty ones anymore; they had some relationship issues with another dancer; their friends are not coming and they don't want to go alone.

| what is visible to people watching in a crowd is a pretty distant second to what's happening in the embrace.

Again this is a kind of myopia that holds tango back.  To grow the tango scene we need to attract new people, to attract we must command their attention.  That attention cannot happen if everything in tango is introspective and hidden from view.

How do the neophytes know a dancer is good?  Because we tell them they are the best we have.  But do we know what is best?  That is why we need to have proper assessement, like how wines are graded by ""experts"" and eventually we all agree on which goes on the top shelf.",2015-09-18 21:44:04+00:00,cv6c0rc,3.0,t1_cv63vgb,13053,tango
178,"Pretty quickly from what I could observe.  There was a Zumba class in the next adjacent studio where we conduct our Tango lesson.  I was amazed at how much more the attendence -- we had 10 people, they had 50 squeezed into the same dimension;  the high energy music was also much louder than ours.  About half were there first time and they seem to enjoy themselves.

I believe Zumba is essentially a kind of trademarked ""line dancing"" done to Latin music (they have their own CDs), invented to sell  aerobics workouts and trainer certification.  It seems to attract mostly women but also all ages from children to matrons.  Many fitness instructors I know had to get certified because it was the fastest growing activity past few years.

I suspect the appeal of Zumba at the beginning is: no need to partner up, no hard technique to master, and gets non-dancers started in this type of movement.   The blending of dancing and fitness means it is offered in gyms instead of dance studios, and there many more of the former in any big city.

I am of the opinion that Zumba is something like a gateway drug for the non-dancing public to experience what dancing feels like, and to hear the type of music that are not playing regularly on the radio.  Once that bridge is crossed, it could be a lot easier for them to explore actual genres of Latin dances.

179,"Like the author of the linked article, I picked up dancing via the ballroom world, so I saw first hand how an institutionalized focus on competitions can distract people from the simple joy of dancing.

So I went into Tango to escape from competitions.  Tango would be a Zen experience, providing only inner dialog and enjoyment.

Nevertheless in the past few years I have actually turned around in that opinion.  Competition is not inherently a bad influence; in fact it can become a positive force if used correctly..

First, dancers need some kind of path to grow along.  Any activity that you do for more than five years, you have an expectation of improvement and achievement.

Second, as long as competition celebrates diversity and not uniformity, it can still drive creativity.  A beauty contest with only one standard --- a skinny tall blond --- reinforces one type of perfection.  A beauty contest celebrating all female types can raise the confidence of all women.

Third, people outside Tango frequently only pay attention to the best in this genre.  They want to be impressed when they see a world class tango dancer in action.   This is good for the growth of the dance.  Almost everyone I know started to learn tango only because they saw one dance demonstration that really impressed them.

Then they return to Real Life.

I have observed that Tango inspires in older people the same kind of fever.  I have seen people give up good careers to live the milonguero life, to try to dance for living, to write books and make films.  I have seen retirees move to Buenos Aires permanently.

For older people with some financial reserves, there is no urgent need to wake up from the dream.  But if you are mid-career and invested your best years on building a life on tango, you hope it will at least lead to something sustainable.

I am not entirely pessimistic, but I think the solution requires expanding the tango fan base from tens of thousands to tens of millions (1000x increase).  Only then will this provide a sufficient market base to teachers, musicians, producers and merchandizers.

If you have a positive attitude, the right combination of teachers, role model, and listening/practica environment, you should be able to attain a transformation into a fully functioning social dancer --- defined as confidence, mind-body connection, musicality, and smoothness in movement --- within the first two years.  

Notice there is a big ""if"" in that paragraph.  Most people living outside Buenos Aires and big tango cities do not have all the right conditions!  Yes it can then take quite a bit longer, but still I would say 4-5 years is enough for most serious learners.

The transition point to a good functioning leader, is not really based on how many steps you can do, but mostly on how well you can walk to music using fundamental steps.  

A good leader with strong technique should be able to lead any follower of any skill level without coercion or force.  

- Imagine how you may accompany a frail grandmother or a child to cross the road --- common sense will guide you to walk very slowly, carefully, and match every steps to theirs, but do not drag or push.  

- You must leave the actual walking to them.  This can be summed up in Gavito's quote: I lead and I follow.  This means I lead (the action), and then follow (the reaction).  

- Most beginners guide the body but forget to guide the feet first.  The result is liking tipping the follower.   A good leader makes use of upward and downward energy to talk to the free legs.

- Some dancers set their goal to enter the Mundial Championship, they want to share the arena with the most driven dancers in the world.  They measure their success by their ladder position in competition.

- Some dancers become community builders, organizing milongas and festivals, and working on DJ crafts.  They measure their success in terms of community growth and social engagement.

- Some dancers turn into teachers and build their own following of learners.  Their success is both in terms of their competence to teach well, and how their students develop.

- Some dancers just aim to have a good time, in terms of getting good tandas at milongas and festivals.  They build a strategy around maximizing the encounter of tango partners.  They may even migrate to Buenos Aires.

Personally I know individuals who examplify each one of these categories.   

So in this discussion I also hope to get comments from these Tango Journeymen, to hear their goals and plans and strategies to achieve them.

And like chess, half the fun is in studying ""what if"", and breaking the normal pattern of play.  It can be very humbling when you dance with a worthy partner, and feel the excitement of brawn and brain firing at the same time.",2015-09-02 09:24:21+00:00,cunz267,2.0,t1_cumwy6r,77728,tango

193,"If you don't experience the rivalry and scarcity then you must either be extremely lucky or oblivious.  Probably you are with the right group of friends.

The number one reason for doing tango, for a man, is almost always to win over women that they have yet to meet.  A healthy community should enable a constant flux of new, repeat and visiting partners over a few big nexus of interaction, the anchor milongas.  But the reality for most tangueros around the world is the opposite:  small dancer numbers, static or low rate of circulation, too many organisers chasing too few consumers, lack of cooperation between organisers creating factions.

As for the bad information flow, ask yourself what a learned tangueros should know in addition to good movement and musicality --- the history, the artistes, different styles and schools of tango, the major acclaimed creative productions, the geography of tango, non-Argentina tango culture, etc --- ask how many tango teachers are able to teach any of this.  

Of course you could learn all these by talking to people and travelling a lot, but then what you discover would also be different from every other person. The absence of ""common knowledge"" in my opinion is how rivalry is seeded.  Every argument begins with ""that's not real tango"" and ""they do it like this in Buenos Aires"" when it was all hearsay.

194,"Of course, tango is the eternal search for the perfect dance connection.  That is after all the first catchphrase we learnt in our dance lessons.  But can this feeling be defined as success?  

- If you scored an A in school, you studied hard and smart.

- If you strike the lottery, you are lucky.

Most of the time, the perfect connection is like lottery :  you are in the right place with the right person at the right moment.

Success (of the type that derives from a course of intelligent action) in this case means working diligently on your skill, taking chances with new partners, and maximising your exposure to every dance opportunity.

In her blog she was curious why the word milonga did not appear in any of the ads for live orchestra entertainment in the 1943 newspaper -- it was usually a venue, a band name, and sometimes the word ""baile"" (dance).

She mentioned several reasons: Peron's government, the popular meaning of milonguear as going out to dance, and some rivalry between leaders and live singers in winning ""ladies' attention"". Then she mentioned the 1948 date when confiteria bailable (teahouse with dance floors) began to promote their milongas.

I'm still awaiting a historian to give an authoritative analysis :)

The musical genre is probably what most of the world know best about Argentina... in addition to its soccer prowess (Maradona), and the currency deflation which made it one of the most affordable tourist destination.

Argentina is a curious blend of faded glory and lost potential.

My first dances were Ballroom, which are count-based and fixed sequences.  Learning this way got me nowhere musicality-wise but at least convinced me I could overcome my ""two left feet"".

Later I start to learn Jazz dances, like Lindy Hop, tap dance and Swing, and that brought about a huge leap in musicality awareness.

Many new tango dancers enter the genre without any prior dance movement skill, cannot understand Spanish, have never heard real tango music, and brainwashed by the pop media to think tango is more about poses and stunts instead of music.

The teaching of musicality is the hardest challenge of tango teachers.  Many teachers do not even try to allocate class time to it, because they have no way to measure progress.  To my knowledge Joaquin is the only person to even attempt to tackle this topic in a book.

212,"First thing to remember is that, Joaquin Amenabar is primarily a musician (bandoneon).  A dancer writing the same topic would probably have used different strategies for explanation.

The music has two parallel parts: the rhythm, and the melody.  The rhythm usually follows a repeating pattern of (1)-2-(3)-4 or (1)-2-3-4, notated as 2/4 or 4/4 time.  The on-beats are the stronger beats in each bar.

The melody is either the sung lyrics of the song or an instrumental part played over the rhythm.   It is more tricky to follow the melody, but think of it like how you may recite a poem: not every syllable should have the same emphasis, and where you place the pauses are just as important as where the words are, maybe even more.  

A beginner should first master walking on the rhythm with strong regular beats like Biagi and D'Arienzo.  Once you tuned your walk to sync with the (1) beats -- the on-beats -- you should learn to step into some off-beats, or what we call syncopation, using runs, rebounds, or half-steps.

Dancing on the melody is next level.  You have to choose the steps more carefully, based on an instant poetic interpretation of the melody, and this is much simpler if you know the Spanish lyrics well.  Then use all the walking techniques in your arsenel to turn that walk into the equivalent of reciting a poem with your feet.",2015-07-25 22:52:01+00:00,ctg47gw,1.0,t3_3eis2u,72178,tango

""... But a lot of the newer Kizomba peeps? With all the fancy moves? .... Often times you talk a good game about connection, but your dance seems to have become an exercise in how to wow the crowd or show off a new move.

""Kizomba is also rapidly changing.  I’ve seen demos that look suspiciously like milonga and others that are drifting to the Tango Nuevo zone.  I’ve seen people add in salsa and bachata-like grinds, spins, and hips.  It will be exciting to watch what happens in the future.  Will Kizomba people start coming to Tango? Will Tango people go to Kizomba?  Will the two sides begin a dance war, then be locked in a gymnasium and finally realize that we have a lot in common, beginning a new dawn of dance?""

Another excellent analysis from [Frances Tee](http://kizombaseattle.blogspot.sg/2012/11/kizomba-and-tango_17.html):

""When I dance tango, it feels like gliding on ice, with the feet ""caressing the floor"". There is a gathering of energy and then push and slide to get from one point to the next. There is also the occasional twist and pivot , that creates an illusion of  stillness this effect of stillness followed by a burst of energy - much like when you tighten the coils in a spring and then release to twirl. The dance is precise but allows for moments of stillness and playfulness as the music runs its course.

""When I dance kizomba, I feel like I'm in one long hug, walking in gooo, trying to pick up my feet but being unable to do so. The  music has a pulse like a heartbeat and in that relaxed and secure embrace, I move with my partner.  Our movements fill up even the spaces between the pulse in the song and we are in no particular hurry to get anywhere, just chilling out and enjoying the music together. Kizomba at its best, is a dance where I can relax into my partners embrace, feel the music through his lead and simply dance.""",2015-07-24 00:56:22+00:00,cte1rgh,1.0,t3_3ee2ij,522,tango

219,"Adapted from [obituary](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/osvaldo-pugliese-1594093.html) in Independent newspaper: 

It is an irony that Osvaldo Pugliese, the last of the great tango composers and musicians, should have died during a Peronist government in Argentina. The ""passionate necrophiles"" Peronists do death very well with huge tributes and made a big event of the funeral wake at City Hall, and everybody in politics was there to be seen.

Yet Pugliese has always had bad relationship with the government.  He was thrown into prison several times during the first government (1946-1955) of General Juan Peron.  The military regime that overthrew Peron in 1955 also locked him up.  

He had joined the Communist Party in 1936, when he was 31, ""to fight for a more democratic and just society where work is part of human dignity, and not a punishment"".  The obituaries hardly mentioned his political affiliation. They said he never mixed music and ideology. 

But he applied his politics as a working musician. His bandmates remember that the cash --- which Pugliese was able to ask for in quite substantial figures --- was always shared, co-operative-style, among all members of an orchestra.

And when Pugliese could not play, because he was locked up, or banned, the band played on, with a single red carnation laid on the piano to symbolise the presence of the Maestro.

The 1960s government of the late General Juan Carlos Ongana, who had a deep fear of Peronists and Communists alike, simply banned Pugliese from radio broadcasts and public places after Pugliese performed in the Soviet Union in 1959. 

But when he died, Pugliese will only be remembered as the last great orquesta tipica of a tango generation, who witnessed his greatest applause in the Colon opera house in 1985.

Pugliese composed 150 themes, ranging from ""waltzes"" to rancheras and milongas, and even one shimie. But he was best known for his tango compositions. 

Among the best of them and the most played were ""Negracha"", ""La Yumba"" and ""Malandraca"" (three titles with references to the roughest sections of society).  Also among his leading compositions are ""Recien"" (""Just Now"", with Homero Manzi), ""Una vez"" (""Once"", with Ctulo Castillo), and ""Igual que una sombra"" (""Just like a shadow"", with Enrique Cadcamo) - three more names in tango that will never be forgotten.

224,"A rough translation:

""The subject itself is profound... The tango was instrumental in the history of Argentine show, either in theaters, on radio and on television. Radio and theater tango is still very important and has a lot of publicity. 

""The issue that concerns us is the reason for the separation of tango with television.  In the air channels broadcasting is zero.  The question is based on why this happens when a musical style that marks the Argentines, even if today have less cultural importance than a few decades ago, is still significant and popular.

""The objective of this study is to know the many reasons that bind to the absence of tango on television.  It is often stated as a fact that 'Tango does not sell'.  Why not?  

""One respondent helped clarify these questions, with a trigger phrase that serves to construct a theory: ""The music we listen to young people's fashion, the rest are classical music."" Young people are the ones that generate higher consumption, television is strongly influenced by the sale of advertising, a program can not exist artistically only for its quality, you have to know how to sell. 

""The object of study that will try to show is that fashion dictates what is seen and not seen on television.""

The rest of the paper contains a list of TV music and talent programs currently on air (""Bailando"" etc) and analyse what factors made them more desirable than the national symbol of Argentina.",2015-07-14 23:44:44+00:00,ct3jzvv,1.0,t3_3dbez5,520,tango

""Evaluation criteria: 

-  1. TANGO DE PISTA (SALON TANGO) (UNRESTRICTED ENTRY, AMATEURS AND PROFESSIONALS)

Tango de pista (Salon Tango) is conceived as a social dance, where the most important aspects are the musicality, embrace and connection between the dance partners.

Once formed, the couple must not separate while the music is playing. For the position to be considered correct, the body of one of the members of the couple must be contained at all the time by the arm of the other. It is understood that in certain figures this may be flexible, but not throughout the whole duration of the dance. All movements must be made within the space allowed by the couple’s embrace, so as not to get in the way of the other couples dancing. The leader may invite the follower to walk and/or turn to their right or left, without taking steps backwards on the dance floor.

The Jury will take into account the couple’s connection, musicality, walking and search for their own expression as fundamental to the score.

Couples may change the dynamics and speed during a song.

Within these parameters, the couple may perform any commonly used figures of “social” tango, including barridas (sweeps), sacadas al piso (drawn to the floor), enrosques (twists), etc. Jumps, figures that involve lifting both feet off the ground and any other choreographic possibilities typical of Stage Tango are completely forbidden.

As is typical in a dancehall, couples must constantly move counterclockwise without going backwards. They will be allowed, if needed, to walk one or two step backwards at most.

If a couple performs more than two phrases in the same spot, obstructing the circulation on the dance floor, the Jury may consider lowering their score.

In the event that one couple stops the flow of traffic around the dance floor, it is not possible for other couples to go past them. If the jury deems it necessary, the round of couples may have to dance to another tango to solve the inconvenience.

Outfits will not be taken into consideration during the judging process. Partners do not need to break the embrace between songs.

-  2. STAGE TANGO (UNRESTRICTED ENTRY, AMATEURS AND PROFESSIONALS)

Participants will be able to express their view of the Argentine tango dance. This means that couples will be allowed to perform movements, figures and applications that are not directly related to the traditional tango dance. But the choreography must include traditional elements of tango: figure eights, spins, long walks, voleos, hooks, and the “milonguero embrace.” Couples will be able to break the embrace and use techniques from other dance disciplines, as long as they are justified and enrich the performance of the dancer.

Aerial tricks and movements from other dance disciplines must not be excessive. This means that they must not exceed a third of the overall performance. The couple must include floor movement sequences throughout the whole stage floor.

Outfits will not be taken into consideration during the judging process.

If a technical problem should occur, the Jury will evaluate the repetition of the choreography at the end of the assigned performing time slot.

In case of having a problem with the choreography, the couple will decide whether to continue dancing or not, and the Jury will evaluate the manner and grace with which they solve the inconvenience; but the couple will not be allowed to repeat the performance.""

227,"The second biggest city of Colombia is more famous for being the hometown of drug lord Escobar than a capital of Tango, but that's what it is, based on the recently concluded [World Tango Championship](http://www.worldtangochampionships.co/) and [Medellin International Tango Festival](http://www.festivaldetangomedellin.com/).  Many of the top tangueros from Colombia are at the same calibre of the best in Argentina, so they often place highly in the Argentina world championship finals in August.

Carlos Gardel's name was forever linked to Medellin as he died there in a plane crash in 1935, while on a concert tour of the region.  Today there is a special monument dedicated to Gardel near the airport, and every year his fans still come to visit the site.

If you like to know details of how tango became popular in Colombia, Catalina Santamaria-Delgado's [scholarly report](http://www.academia.edu/234477/Tangos_reterritorialization_in_Medell%C3%ADn) is a good read.",2015-07-05 01:30:15+00:00,cssgl4b,1.0,t3_3c5ngv,973,tango
228,"Short answer is there is only one tango ""form"", even if there are different methodologies of achieving it, and they are probably trying to teach you different techniques.

The Russian's emphasis on the sliding of feet, if I hazard a guess, is similar to the way we do in Asia.  Beginning dancers have a ""lazy thigh"" that needs to be coached to place more precisely along the line of walk, and also to fully extend before shifting the weight.  

And how does the partner know the direction to follow?  By feeling the intention of the leader through the embrace as the foot slide.  A leader must train himself to control his feet and body intention separately; so he can align them to accompany the woman, or dissociate them to send her sideway while stepping forward, like in a Giro.   

Newbies to tango may yet to realise one truth: almost no two teachers completely agree on how to teach.  This is such a ""street dance"" that frequently there are different words used to describe the same movement, different ideas about how to embrace, whether to walk toe first or heel first, and which orchestra works best or not.  Old teachers from Argentina tend to spend months on walking and feeling the music first, while Europeans like to start with technical tips.  

That is why tango is not learned in one continuous session from one teacher --- rather it is necessary to grow and mature from cycles of learning, trying, doing, and exploring new ideas with new teachers.  Then your dancing will evolve to become what works best for your body and personality.",2015-07-04 00:16:38+00:00,csrihs0,1.0,t3_3c0upl,18656,tango
229,"When visitors to Japan go to a milonga, they are always surprised how early the event ends.  Some of the reasons have to do with catching the last train into the suburbs, but another big reason is that Japanese law actually forbid dancing after midnight.  This law has been in force for 67 years since the end of the World War II, as a blanket anti-vice regulation, and it has forced almost all forms of dancing underground (a police-issued dance permit is required by any venue offering dancing).

Two years ago a group of Japanese tango schools began to organise a response to this law, since tango is obviously as pure as snow ... they negotiated a special concession with the Police for tango schools to be excluded from the dance ban, as long as the schools are ""operated by certified members of a professional tango teacher's association"".  

The next problem was how to create such an organisation and how to certify who is a professional teacher, as there are many unlicensed teachers operating programs under the radar.

The producers had a company of artistes, a motley crew assembled from various sources without a common performance history, and tired after a whirlwind European pre-tour, still quite unsure what sort of reception this show will get.  

Do the Americans want to see Argentina's musical cliches?

By the end of October, it was clear.  Tango Argentino has conquered America.  The next six months the company did 200 performances, and grossed $6.6M.

From the New York Times: ""Even on Broadway, where musicals about felines and female impersonators can become hits, ''Tango Argentino' arrived in October as the longest of shots. 

""Here was a show, after all, that violated the Broadway dictum that musicals be elaborate, expensive and stocked with supple young bodies. 'Tango Argentino' wasn't even in English.

""Ten weeks later, this evening of tango song and dance has not only become the unlikeliest hit of the season but has also inspired a popular culture craze unmatched by any Broadway show since 'The Boy Friend.' 

""What the 1954 musical comedy did for the Charleston and the flapper's chemise, 'Tango Argentino' has done for slit skirts, silk scarves and male dominance, at least on the dance floor. ""
