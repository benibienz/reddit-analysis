One of the smarter ideas from that era is the use of a common BIOS to make all the PC-clones identical to the operating system, so one common Windows OS release can be installed everywhere.  The common baseline ensures the minimal usability is always achieved at the end of system installation. Yes there are still hardware-specific drivers but even if these are not installed the basic system still works.  It is much easier to fix a driver problem when the system is up and connectivity to the Internet is there.

So my big question is about Android fragmentation, the inability to get every phone to the latest release.  Why in the era of Java and JVM/JIT optimisation, it is not possible to make a process whereby all the phone manufacturers achieve a baseline of hardware compatibility (virtually)?  Why is not possible to have one common system release that everyone can install?  Why is the hardware dependant features of phones not moved into driver libraries (to be upgraded separately), but bundled monolithically into ROMs making the need for the complexity of tracking builds, versions, manufacturer, chipset etc.

TLDR: Why are the best practices of PC era not applied to the Mobile era?

[EDIT] Yes I know the obvious explanations are: manufacturers don't care about customers' need to upgrade, they want to differentiate their hardware, there is no incentive, etc.  Economic and strategic reasons.  But I cannot imagine anyone coming in from the engineering side would prefer the current messy situation -- it reminds me of the pre-EU decision to standardize power charging cables.  The prevention of wastage from that one decision alone made the world better, and brands were able to simply carry on their business without mucking with that one interface.",Android,Why don't Android hardware manufacturers build to a common BIOS specification?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/53aaf5/why_dont_android_hardware_manufacturers_build_to/

Before he was elected he served as the Mayor of Buenos Aires, under his watch several revered old milongas were raided and closed for lack of proper building papers.  

As president he pushed for pro-export policies, thus undoing many of his predecessor's pro-poor policies.  Among these are revision to tariffs to market prices, floating the currency and targetting the black / gray markets.

The most recent power tariff adjustment has triggered protests from the Association of Milonga Organisers [(spanish)](http://www.clarin.com/ciudades/Milongas-simbolo-porteno-peligra-aumento_0_1598840239.html?ns_mchannel=ultimas-noticias) | [(english)](http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.clarin.com%2Fciudades%2FMilongas-simbolo-porteno-peligra-aumento_0_1598840239.html%3Fns_mchannel%3Dultimas-noticias&amp;tl=en).

The AOM complains that milongas are already facing low attendence due to the cold season, and the rise in electricity tariffs will result in entrada that may double or triple entradas, already exceeding 100pesos each.  The outcome will be pricing out the locals from the traditional neighbourhood clubs. ""A dance with 10 or 20 people is not a milonga"", he said.

Some milongas have apparently been billed between 4000 to 15000pesos in utilities.  Some neighbourhood clubs are eligible to receive a subsidy to offset the increase, but only if they meet eligibility, have a tax registration, and file their application before 1/jul deadline.  Apparently out of 4500 sports clubs with less than 2000 members, only 800 meet the criteria. [(spanish)](http://www.clarin.com/ciudades/Clubes-barrio-siguen-lograr-subsidios_0_1598840238.html) | [(english)](http://translate.google.com/translate?depth=1&amp;u=http://www.clarin.com/ciudades/Clubes-barrio-siguen-lograr-subsidios_0_1598840238.html)

The AOM also laments that the government is not treating the milongas as a special part of the national culture deserving special support and funding.  Instead it is applying the general business operating laws to milongas.  The continuing imbalance between revenue and costs threatens the livelihood of organisers and milonga workers.

So in summary, in the home city of Tango, with low energy tariffs, salaries and property prices, the highest number of active local dancers and tourist milonga visitors, where milongas open every day for evenings and sometimes also for afternoons --- even they cannot make the milonga stay in the black.

- - -

As I myself also have operated milongas for more than a decade, I too know how difficult it is to run a weekly milonga like a business.

You need a fair amount of dancing and seating space, you need chairs and tables, aircon and cool drinks; frequently you are also required to pay various permits and copyright fees.  Most DJs and hosts are not paid, but they contribute their time as a service to the community to help the milonga minimise loss or remain at break-even.  

Unfortunately for non-Argentinian cities, we cannot appeal to the use of public funds.  There is not a tradition to be preserved and not a sizeable percentage of population to be appeased.  

Hence, most milongas live in the open market, either they have to generate their costs fully, or they are treated as a kind of hobby expenditure.

Taken together, they represent the strongest obstacles to prevent tango workers around the world from being able to work in milongas as a full-time job.

This post is purely to open for discussion -- how can milongas be a break-even business?  does it have to take the form of a bar or cafe? If prices have to rise so high that only the rich can afford to go to milongas, will it still have a point to exist?  Or can milongas become a public-funded good, like a community charity project to build social bondings or serve the poor / marginal groups?

As long as the subject of your post is Tango, there are very few restrictions about what posts are disallowed.   We want to encourage all types of discussions, whether about dance, music, people, books, films, events, or controversial topics.  

**Titles must include the subject, and provide enough hints without requiring the reader to click on the link or read the full article**.  

We have simplified to only three Automoderator rules:

1. Short titles are sent to moderator for review.  A title that is too short is suspected to be ""link bait"", or an indication that it does not address the subject.  Always ask yourself, can I understand who + what + why I want to read this post from the title alone.

2. Titles containing non-English characters are sent to moderator for review.  A title that is non-English should be rewritten fully or partly in English, otherwise it will not be read by most readers.

3. There are some banned words and sites that will lead to auto-deletion.

Please learn how to write good quality titles that will help to spur discussion.  Readers must feel motivated to respond just from glancing at the titles alone.

Posts that are questions to the community are especially frequently bad -- you need to explain the context of your question and never assume anything.  A couple more context words will clarify a lot ... remember this is a worldwide community.

If in doubt write to moderators with questions and suggestions.  Posts that end in moderator's queue may still be approved eventually, but this depends on the mods clearing out the modqueue at end of month.",tango,Submitting Your Posts to r/tango for the first time?

Why are regular dress suits unsuitable for tango?  Most dress styles have restricted movement due to low arm holes and lack of gussetting in the armpits and backs.  The suit looks fitted with the  arms down, but rides up when the arms are raised.

In the centuries when men wear a suit everyday (before 1950s) tailors have learned how to adapt the suit format to action jobs, like hunters and policemen.   Here is an [article where a bespoke tailor explains how to cut a suit for James Bond](http://www.vulture.com/2012/11/bespoke-tailor-explains-james-bonds-suits.html).

He also mentions that action-ready pants (that you can jump and do a high kick in) should have slim legs and high waist and crotch.  This seems to be in direct opposite to the tango pants trend in Argentina, which is baggy low crotch.

Regarding Argentine Tango -- it is of course a dance but it is a musical genre with 100 years' history, a platform for social interaction, and a game of both physical and mental acrobatics.  In 2013 the UNESCO proclaimed the tango the common cultural heritage of the world.

We are the first tango school in SG.  Even though we have been teaching and running programs for 17 years there is still a very small degree of awareness.  By my reckoning, SG's 5 million people should translate to a couple of thousand learners but so far this has not happened.  We have very few younger people for instance.

So this is what I would like to ask you in /r/singapore to help me to help you.   We would like to devote the entire year of 2016 to Outreach, and plant the seed of tango as widely as possible.  

To do that we will organise taster sessions for anyone in SG who is interested, at reduced charges, and this can happen anywhere on the island (or you can come to our studios downtown).  All we ask is that you gather at least 10 people for each 1.5hr session.

I would like to appeal to student groups in the varsity, expat social clubs, fitness groups, friends and co-workers, etc.  If you have any interest at all, just to discover what tango can offer you, and is willing to bring your group to a session, we will work out a schedule for you.

This Sat (9/1) we have our regular tango dancing party, and it's 8pm at our studio.  If you would like to come and talk to us face to face please PM me for an invitation.  Or just send me questions online.",singapore,"Tango, anyone?

However the problem is now emerging that many submissions have poorly written titles.  

Sometimes it is just a word without context (""The Bandoneon""), sometimes a meaningless phrase (""Lori - Abbey Road""), and sometimes the title is of poor journalistic quality (""The most wild tango I have ever seen"").

Because Reddit does not allow moderators or posters to change the title after it has been published, we are unable to improve the quality of titles after publication.  

In some subreddit the policy has been to turn on moderation mode and keep rejecting a post until the title is deemed acceptable.  

We prefer not to go this route, so that there is no unnecessary delays, and we want to help you learn how to write good titles yourself.

So we ask for your cooperation.  In submitting a post, please keep in mind the best title for it should be: (1) A complete sentence (with subject, object, action) (2) summarizes the linked content or asks a pertinent questions, and (3) have supportable claims (not just based on what one person knows).

If you are truly unsure how to submit, you can also write to the moderators (via moderator mail) and we will give you the explanation and suggestion.

I am now trying to modernize my knowledge as quickly as possible, but I'm still stumbling over many new words in the modern PHP lexicons.  I know reading all the reference documents is the first step, and I've already done some of them, but frequently I just want too look up a dictionary definition quickly to jog my memory, and not to divert into a half day reading of something heavy.

So I guess I'm asking if there is a dictionary or glossary for quick lookups.  While we're at it, I would also like a quick summary of new tools like ""gulp"", ""composer"" and ""packagist"".  I know the commands but I don't know how they fit together, which tools are the basic essentials.

[EDIT] Thanks guys, most of your responses is the same set of what ""books"" to read to learn Laravel / composer / design patterns.  My question is actually more of ""I have read the usual recommended books, and now I want a dictionary to quickly look up a summary of a buzzword to refesh my understanding"".  

Frequently two people read the same book, they understand the same buzzword in different ways.  A TLDR summary is great for zooming right into the essential ideas.   All the books/articles/source codes add up to 100Ks of words, a list of essential buzzwords may be 1-5K words long, and much more useful as a cheat sheet.

[EDIT 2] Based on the immediate responses I think the short answer there isn't currently an online TLDR glossary of PHP/framework buzzwords.  That's fine, it's just put me back to what I have to do the longer way.  I am keeping notes on my own for my team, and later on I will share them online if there is interest.

The summaries I'm looking is something like this:  ""Composer - A command line application (written in PHP) that manages the dependency of PHP library packages. It works with the Packagist depository to automatically resolve dependency, fetch the sources, install them into the correct directory, and updates the Autoloading configuration files. Each application gets its own package directory, so it is possible for each application to use different versions of libraries. If a library is not registered on Packagist, see PSRx for ways to link them into the application. (Website: xxx, Documentation: xxxx, Tutorial: xxxx)"".

Tango in fact surpassed Salsa in 2011 in popularity.  But Zumba appears out of nowhere, rising meteorically in 2010, and now dwarfs everyone else.

On Reddit the distribution is quite different.  The /r/Tango subreddit has 777 subscribers, /r/Salsa has 1586 subscribers, /r/SwingDancing has 4384 subscribers, but /r/Zumba surprising has only 1128 subscribers.  Since Reddit also has a high percentage of tech audience, the conclusion might be that Swing is more  geek-friendly, or that Swingers have more buzz to share.

On Facebook, a rough proxy is the number of Likes attached to each dance.  It is also more reflective of worldwide, non-geek audience.  Zumba's score is around 7million, Salsa Dancing 537K, Swing Dancing 68K, and Tango Dance around 31K.

So a quick poll of the various dances, using unscientific proxy measurements, have consistently shown that Zumba is the top of the heap and Tango near the bottom.  The difference between the top and bottom can be more than 10,000x.

So my question for the day is, what is something we could do, change, or copy, to make Tango more popular to the general public?

The apparent reason was lack of studio space, she explains, but also she felt a lack of motivation.

Most tango organisers and teachers who decide to retire usually just fade away quietly.  Many hundreds of tango domains and blogs simply vanish or expire without a trace.   Sometimes the individual has a life event -- a new baby, a new job -- that takes them outside the tango world. 

But frequently, the reason is [about money, or lack of it](https://www.facebook.com/terpsichoral.tangoaddict/posts/889467434479991).  Tango is a poor man's recreation, building on the corpses of dead musicians, and generally communities are not big enough to deliver a living wage to its protagonists.   

If a teacher earns in USD and spends in Argentine Pesos, it may be somewhat economically viable.  But teachers who earn and spends in a Western economy would find it extremely hard to make cash flow from tango alone.

Add to this the relative high hurdle for tango teachers (in social dancing) to cross over to tango as paid entertainment (for stage, for events, for film, for advertising).  

Most milonga-going dancers also do not buy living musician's recordings.  The first lesson they get from their teachers is that the only music worth collecting are 50 years old.

But is the fever cooling off?  What will the next generation of tango teachers inherit --- more specifically, what will happen to the non-Argentinians?

All in all, I feel the tango ""economy"" is quite unsustainable, as it does not have a stable business cycle, there are few true consumers, and growth mainly depend on the fickleness of public attention.  

It is truly remarkable that passion alone was able to power so many tango teachers, organisers, studios, milongas, festivals, and tours every year.

The song became a hit when new lyrics were added, under the name of ""Si Supieras"" by Pascual Contursi.  ""Cumparsa"" is Lunfardo word meaning a group of people attending the carnival festivals dressed in a similar fashion, so the title means a little marching carnival. 

The tango academies of both Argentina and Uruguay have set 1917 as the official birthdate of the song.  In 2007 they [celebrated the 90th anniversary](https://dancingtotheendoflife.wordpress.com/2009/12/12/la-cumparsita/) as a part of the preparation for inscription of Tango into the UNESCO World Intangible Culture Heritage -- so this means 2017 will be the official 100th anniversay.

Edit: The composer died in 1948, so by the 50 year copyright rule the song is in public domain since 1998.  It is a Buenos Aires tradition for DJs to use La Cumparsita as the closing song of a milonga, and frequently it is also the closing piece of a stage tango show for curtain calls.  

The song has been recorded literally thousands of times, but the version more revered by salon dancers was recorded by D'Arienzo ([watch his energetic rendition on Argentina TV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHOgQQ_D3EY)).  Dancers challenge themselves following each instrument of his orchestra as each take turns to accompany the theme.",tango,"2017 is the official Centennial of the song La Cumparsita, the most famous tango anthem",https://www.reddit.com/r/tango/comments/3k1omj/2017_is_the_official_centennial_of_the_song_la/

Can you define what you hope to achieve?

The reality of tango is that (1) it is very difficult, challenging dance discipline that takes years to be even half good, (2) it is not a good social meet market because the community in most of the world is tiny, and an unhealthy amount of rivalry exist, (3) there are few paid work opportunities, as the top tier is limited to Argentinians, and the next tiers are mostly the established names with their own networks, (4) the mass popularity of tango in the Real World has not grown as quickly as other Latin genres, so the bandwagon is still stuck in the garage, (5) because the distribution of good teachers is so uneven in the field, even basic knowledge -- like names of key musicians, common vocabulary for steps and figures -- are not well disseminated.  This is both a challenge for teachers and historians.

Edit: Thanks for your comments!  I see a common thread of men driven to the edge of sanity by their wish to gain ladies' approval on the dance floor.  While it can be a positive force for self-improvement (some teachers even indoctrinate their ladies to frustrate weak leaders), it is largely a fallacy that more dance skill = more tandas, or better skill = tangasm.  For the beginner's first few years, gender relation is probably the only scorecard that matters -- but don't neglect to work on your personality too.

I am also seeking comments from the Journeymen, people from year 4 onwards who passed their Novice stage, and who are now working towards other tango goals -- financial, creative, community, fame.  What do you hope to have achieved in your tango life in 5 year's time? ten? how do you do that?

This year is a clean sweep by Argentina, although the challenge from Russia is formidable; other countries that had large number of qualifiers are Colombia and Italy.  

If the trend of huge first rounds continue --- this year is 700+ entries in the Salon division --- in future they may have to cap the number of applicants, or have more pre-rounds.

For many tango dancers, the event in Buenos Aires is the only truly credible arena to compete in, although some will be content to reach the regionals in Tokyo, Rome or other big cities.

It may not be essential to have ever competed or performed to be a complete tanguero, but it does add to the variety of learning experience.

From [La Milonga Magazine](http://www.lamilongaargentina.com.ar): 

""March Against Closure of City Milongas""

On Friday the milonga organizers of Buenos Aires will hold a protest against the closures of tango salons by the city government that shut down the city's most traditional and famous sites, reported the Milonga Organizers Association (AOM).

The demonstration will take place at 3pm at 500 Avenida de Mayo, opposite the Headquarters of Government of the City, says Julio Bazan, president of the AOM.

Speaking to Telam, he explained that both ""Sin Rumbo"" and ""Sunderland"" of Villa Urquiza were closed within a week; ""El Arranque"" in the modern salon 'La Argentina' was closed for three months, and were ""handed a temporary permit even though the place has all the facilities of a modern disco"".

Bazan explained that in the two local authorities require ""fixed installations"" fire extinguisher systems when the law called for only mobile ones. 

Two months ago Canning also closed the hall, the neighborhood of Palermo, where Parakultural milonga is performed, because the owners of the place not timely submitted a certificate must rise every year, affecting those who rent the hall.

This form, called 878, has produced most of the temporary closure ""for bureaucratic reasons while demanding almost no infrastructure changes,"" said Bazán.

From [Association of Organisers of Milongas](http://www.milongas.org.ar/noticias/71-comunicado-aom-sobre-clausura-de-milongas):

The Association of Milongas Organizers (AOM) express their dissatisfaction and concern over closures of spaces for cultural development of Tango in the City of Buenos Aires.

Tango, declared to the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site in 2009, lives in the milongas the year 365, and milongas, in turn, live in neighborhoods through their clubs, associations, building societies and squares, employing thousands of people.

Since its inception the AOM works with all organizers of milongas and with the GCBA (municipal government of BsAs) to conduct  various actions related to the promotion and dissemination of resolutions of problems regarding authorizations and permits.

Currently these areas are affected by the following problems:

-  Lack of coordination of relevant addresses for the issuance of permits and permissions. It takes 6 months to obtain the permits whose validity is annual.

-  Lack of knowledge and erroneous interpretation of existing rules applicable to Milongas by public officials who have the authority to proceed with the closures, when they should be trained, especially in matters within its competence.

The AOM confirms the need to comply with regulations for the safety of all, but also demands the milongas are treated with respect as other areas where it has a planning inspections and reasonable time to adapt.

For these reasons the AOM asks:

-  Scheduled inspections.

-  Reasonable period of adjustment.

-  Reviewing and updating existing regulations, together with AOM.

-  Promotion of cultural heritage, which produces much revenue the important tourist city as artistic

Therefore, CALL UPON teachers, dancers, deejays, milonga organisers, milongueros and all lovers of the genre to support the Tango at --- Friday July 3 at 1500hs, at Avenido de Mayo 500, in an open air milonga, to let us express our ideas peacefully to penetrate the deafness of the government.
