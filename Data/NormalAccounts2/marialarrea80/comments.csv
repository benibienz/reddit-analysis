10,Side effect of Champix is depression... I know it as I have depression and can't have it. Try something else. I'm having lots of support from my doctor and stop smoking advicer. A massive addiction for over years of course can cause depression anxiety and feeling like you do. It will take some time. Small goals everyday and a small treat for everyday u don't smoke. ☺️,2015-10-01 23:24:54+00:00,cvl3lax,1,t3_3n4lec,20608,stopsmoking

He brought me a small candle as a reward for the hard work those few first days are. Try to find a quiet place on your own (sometimes is difficult I know), put spotify on with a nice calm play list (the one I use is called Decompression. Then after breathing a few times I start repeating to myself I'm doing v well (I chose this sentence because other stuff going on at the same time) but maybe repeat something like this is temporary, things will get easier, I want stop smoking, I can stop smoking! We can do this. The support from people of this site is great so we can help each other. Good luck with day 6. My day 6 starts tomorrow at 5pm and have the review with the stop smoking advicer.

If you think about it smoking is something we have done since we were 14 every single day for 22 and 30 years! Break this habit is not going to be in 2 days 2 weeks or 2 months... Hopefully things will get a little easier. I feel quite low today my baby had a bad night and been awake since 6am. Will have a small nap as soon as my husband is back from work. When I felt this low and my son came home (after my morning run) and smiled at me everything made sense! We can do this!! You are on day 9 and doing soooo well!

It seems that you don't stop during the day in terms of work, family, house... those cigarettes at night were the perfect moment for you to relax and have your moment. I would say that instead of doing that, why don't you change it to have a bath, relaxing music and maybe read a magazine or a book? Like a small treat everyday just for you. Drinking cold water really helps. Good luck! I have started day 4 today (I slipped last week on day 4 too) so quite scared...
