2,"I play low scrub rengo, but if you want my answer, here you have it 

Runes: Apen, Armor, MR/LVL, Lifesteal


First off, i only play offtank top.I start dorans blade like 99% and i get a second dorans most of the time. That means, i get 12.5% lifesteal at min 5 and this together with fero w and runic armor gives you a LOT of sustain. This allows me to trade free and if you play with the brushes smart, you can get the enemy low most of the time. My first item is always trinity, i build phage first, into sheen if i already got one or two kills or stinger if i am 0/0 or worse. Believe it or not, if you get the 40% attack speed from trinity with the attack speed from fero q and the damage from fervor of battle, you deal sooo much damage. At this point, i can out trade the enemy 99% and if he plays bad get free kills over and over. You can also start roaming mid easy with level 6. After trinity, i just look how the game goes und build maw if they have fed mid, ghostblade if i am far ahead, or visage or omen if it goes ok or i feed :) . 
You can also try out building zhonyas, since it gives you the ability to dive into the enemy team (which you always do when u play offtank) and can survive the burst/cc that comes to you. You can also splitpush very well, and most of the time you can still pick up solo adc when you see them.

This is how i get myself ahead in most of the games.

To your second question, i try to dive into the enemy carrys, but i also like to let the fight engage, then ult into the carrys when the tanks are distracted.

5,"So if i counted right, there are 5 Barrys at his mothers death, 4 of them are Flash. So there is 11 old Barry, the one who originally traveled back in time to stop Eobard Thawne killing himself (the 11 year old Barry), the one from S1 finale with the ""red lightning"" at his chest, then there is Barry traveling in time in S2 finale, and then we can see the ""last"" one who i think is Barry as a time remnant after saving his mother, then traveling back in time to stop his S2 finale one saving his mother. We can see the so called last one also in the S1 finale where the ""red lightning"" Barry peakes through the door, but ""white lightning"" time remnant Barry signals him to back off. Thats my theory. But i also think that it is possible that he won't travel back in time to stop himself, because Eobard mentioned that in 2020 the particle accelerator would explode too. But he speeded things up and let it explode in 2014 already, so the time remnant Barry knows that, and makes sure that he will become the Flash in 2020. In my opinion theory one is much more likely to happen, because if not there will be two seasons of the Flash non existent. I think they keep that setting and Barry will travel back in time once again, to stop himself stopping Thawne. And like i said we can already see that in the S1 finale (he is the one with the ""white lightning"" telling the one traveling back in time in S1 finale to back off and don't secure his mother).",2016-05-25 04:33:56+00:00,d3ipdxi,1,t3_4kx3ne,13265,FlashTV
