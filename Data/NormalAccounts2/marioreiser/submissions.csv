I recently started picking up Aurelion Sol. After playing a few games, understanding his mechaniks i have still some questions left open, which i am going to ask you guys, because i think you will give me the best answers.  so: 1. When do you start roaming (how exactly do you do it), 2. how to play him out in teamfights, 3. How do you use the GLP for animation canceling and last but not least, is it possible to instantly recast the q, because i made the experience of it being kind of inconistent (with recast i mean like anivia). For my runes i use MPEN, HP/LVL, MR, MS and i build GLP &gt; swiftness &gt; Rylais &gt; Void &gt; Rabadons &gt; Liandrys. I assume thats the correct runes + build since i saw many people building like this + i saw it on champion.gg

So i already thank you for the answers,

So there is 11 old Barry, the one who originally traveled back in time to stop Eobard Thawne killing himself (the 11 year old Barry), the one from S1 finale with the ""red lightning"" at his chest, then there is Barry traveling in time in S2 finale, and then we can see the ""last"" one who i think is Barry as a time remnant after saving his mother, then traveling back in time to stop his S2 finale one saving his mother. We can see the so called last one also in the S1 finale where the ""red lightning"" Barry peakes through the door, but ""white lightning"" time remnant Barry signals him to back off. Thats my theory. But i also think that it is possible that he won't travel back in time to stop himself, because Eobard mentioned that in 2020 the particle accelerator would explode too. But he speeded things up and let it explode in 2014 already, so the time remnant Barry knows that, and makes sure that he will become the Flash in 2020. In my opinion theory one is much more likely to happen, because if not there will be two seasons of the Flash non existent. I think they keep that setting and Barry will travel back in time once again, to stop himself stopping Thawne. And like i said we can already see that in the S1 finale (he is the one with the ""white lightning"" telling the one traveling back in time in S1 finale to back off and don't secure his mother).",FlashTV,My theory about S3 and his mothers death as situation in general (Good theory!),https://www.reddit.com/r/FlashTV/comments/4kxtry/my_theory_about_s3_and_his_mothers_death_as/

i am a newbie to Ryze, and since Ghost got buffed this patch, i asked myself if it could be worth it, to take ghost over flash. Not only that Flash has 5 min. cooldown and ghost only 3, it scales off which his ultimate increasing his movementspeed even more. I will try it out in a few games, but i just wanted to ask if you guys played it already, and what opinions do you have about it.",RyzeMains,New ghost on Ryze?,https://www.reddit.com/r/RyzeMains/comments/4keopj/new_ghost_on_ryze/

today i just wondered about getting the 40 or 45% cooldown cap every time, you play assassin rengo.  when i play jungle i get my cdr from boots, ghostblade and trinity. also 10% in runes. also, do you take the 5% cdr in the runes, or do you go with the penetration?
