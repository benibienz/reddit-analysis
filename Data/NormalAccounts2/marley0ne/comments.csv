2 - Thinking with WMI scripting we can pull some performance data.  GFI does not do desktop monitoring unless you have a server license.  Hoping that with a script and WMI it can read the performance data from the last time it checked in and report back things like processor load, disk utilization, memory used.  This way I can tell the client to upgrade memory and upgrade to solid state.

3 - GFI has a script to check if the exchange database is mounted but you have to manually find and enter the database name.  Would like a generic one that checks all exchange databases on the server and confirm they are mounted

4 - Would like a script that checks the exchange queue and makes sure they are not hung up or have emails left in them.

Most clients already have an aging system from Avaya, Panasonic, etc
Existing wiring is already in place.  More looking at a system for that.

On the VoIP end I've been nervous about getting into this.  I tried 3cx and liked the familiarity with Windows and the GUI but nervosa regarding the networking end.  For example with clients that have existing analog pbx I would need to share the computer lines and implement vlans. Then need to think about qos. Just concerned about that.

I use the msp version of storagecraft.  Low monthly cost.  I back up locally to a USB drive and replicate Odysseus with the imagemanager ftp to a large data store offsite.  Has been flawless

I don't get local virtualization but can restore the image back at the office on a temp server

Using a dell t20 or thinkserver is a good idea but you have more upfront cost

I also so this for altaro.  I include the cost. 

For example if my client has 4 servers virtual or physical and I'm trying to sell on msp platform.  I can use that as my bargaining tool.  For $100-$150 month ayce plan will include backup or for xxx a month only get backup.
