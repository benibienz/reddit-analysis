I then run Altaro on a number of HyperV hosts and back then up locally them offsite to a30tb server in my office.  These are encrypted.  I sell this software to the client and include the offsite storage as part of the contract. For break fix clients I charge for the offsite.

I signed up for StorageCraft and have a $250/month bill for licenses.  I backup locally to USB Drive and offsite by FTP to my backup server.

I also run Cloudberry on a few XP machines for a client and it just works.

I'm looking to consolidate.  Clients are primarily in HyperV but some a physical servers.  I'm tired of paying Crashplan for a poor product.  StorageCraft is great but the cost of $25-$30 a server is hurting.

Veeam looked good but reading mixed things here.  Would significantly drop costs.

I would move ask the Crashplan users to Endpoint backup to a local drive and then a B&amp;R repository of just to a cloud repository. My virtual machines would get the $10 license and $5 cloud connect.

My needs and my clients are the following:
- image based backup
- ability to restore individual files easy.  Ideally by mounting the latest backup and restoring
- if server does, ability to restore the physical server back to a physical loaner or ideally a virtual machine
- reliable
- offsite
- easy to monitor (I run n-central)

One of my clients is on a SBS 2008.  I am currently in the process of migrating to Google Apps due to the integration with SalesForce.  We have a new server for the client and it will just be Server 2012 AD, File, Printer, DNS, DHCP.  Originally I was just going to do a fresh install and start fresh.  Now I am thinking against it.  

The server is in decent shape.  Over the years computers have been swapped around and all computer names are out of order.  In the last year this client has had alot of employee turnover and instead of creating fresh users we have just renamed existing accounts.  

Do you think I should migrate or start fresh?

Any way to rename the computers from the server directly so I don't have to log into each one?

Everything else is already in Group Policy so I just need to re-do those for printers, folder redirection and drive mappings.  ",sysadmin,SBS 2008 to Server 2012 - No Exchange,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/3g1j5u/sbs_2008_to_server_2012_no_exchange/
