36,"Tab is really convenient for casual stuff but I agree it's not a replacement for notes on the staff. I honestly like having the two next to each other because I'm lazy and read tab BUT having the music there means I can look at it and understand the rhythm that doesn't get conveyed as well in tab, I can understand the music itself far better than with tab alone, and I can spot if there's a mistake in one or the other! For me at least, I see tab as a tool for learning the music and reading as I go along but not a replacement for understanding the music. If I have just tab in front of me I have a hard time with complex rhythms and if I have just a staff in front of me I can't read it on the fly; having the both together is what I find the best.

57,"Intelligent design accepts evolution and that the universe is billions of years old, it just puts forward that it is entirely possible that is was put into motion by an intelligent being; God is eternal and existed before the beginning of time and is responsible for nudging the first domino in a chain of reactions that led to the creation of everything, especially man. Creationism rejects evolution, the big bang theory, and thinks that the world is several thousand years old. Man was crafted, as is, a few thousand years ago in the Garden of Eden and the world was literally created in six days by God himself. Only the most fundamental denominations believe this; Catholicism recognizes that the two creation stories in the Bible are ancient stories passed down by word of mouth and eventually written down; though divinely inspired by God, the truth they hold is not literal but allegorical. It was a way to explain a vast concept before we had the means to grasp it. Intelligent design rejects the idea that God crafted Adam and Eve, who ate a literal apple given by an actual snake and then banished them to walk the Earth in suffering.

58,"Well Catholicism traces its roots back to the first Apostles that were ordained by Christ himself as priests; the line of popes and bishops stems directly and unbroken from that. Up until Christianity split up into multiple denominations during the middle ages (Lutherans being the most notable), Catholicism was simply Christianity. So yes, it was very much existent at the time; there has been a pope as the head of the church continuously for nearly 2000 years. Monasteries are vastly responsible for keeping education and knowledge alive in Europe; this led to the founding of schools to educate the poor (see St. John Baptiste DeLasalle) and eventually becoming what is today private Catholic schools. So yes, Catholicism was around in the post-Roman era; it may not have been what it was today or called Catholicism but it nevertheless played a vital role in preserving knowledge in a dark time for Europe; many great early scientists were themselves brothers or monks! Sorry for the wall of text, Church History is just really cool and was one of my favorite subjects.",2016-07-12 04:29:58+00:00,d58tw5x,4,t1_d58r989,4901,todayilearned

He explains he forgot he had to go coach soccer practice or some bullshit; food comes out, she goes to bring it to him and he's gone, again. Manager tells her she has to pay for it, she said hell no, he's done this before and it's not her fault, and that she simply won't serve him again. Same day, a different guy comes in, orders a meal to go and sits down at the bar. The second she dropped off his food he bolted for the door; this one she had to pay for - but not before applying her employee discount to the meal. My mom's worked at probably half a dozen very nice, notable restaurants and cafés that have been visited by food network stars and written up in food magazines and every single one has loved to fuck their workers on wages, hours, and benefits.

Does the type of wood of a guitar's body or neck, the type of metal and finish of the hardware, the type of cable you use, whether the nut is bone or synthetic, etc. affect the sound of your guitar? Yes, of course, but not as much as the pickups and amplifier you play through shape your tone. Likewise, though I'm sure silver is different than lacquer, does it affect your tone as much as the type and size of mouthpiece you use, the overall quality of the instrument, or the player's own technique and embouchure? I would say no; maybe a professional playing two identical trombones, one lacquered and one silver, with the same mouthpiece would be able to produce a measurable difference, but isn't tone subjective? I don't know, I'm talking out of my ass but that's just my take; if you've found a horn that you like that will last, then I say go for it :)",2016-04-19 02:49:35+00:00,d28ermd,1,t3_4fagz7,75320,Trombone

One day we were crossing the street in front of our school and I made a joke about how bad she is at crossing the street; I have to start walking even if it's completely clear before she will start to cross. We had a good laugh but then she told me about how in China the roads/drivers are terrible and how in some places, rather than cross the street, you kinda go under the street in a tunnel to cross. She says she remembers being a little girl and going through these tunnels with her mother and having there be people with no eyes or no limbs sitting there under the road begging for money and how she used to be terrified of having to cross under the street.",2016-03-20 18:49:40+00:00,d16yqi5,1,t3_4b6t6j,39586,MorbidReality

237,"As far as Y wing fighters are concerned, I believe reading that even during the Galactic Civil War they were considered outdated. X-wings on the other hand were originally designed for the Empire before the engineers behind it defected to the rebellion - so they couldn't be that outdated. For an in-universe explanation one could argue that the X-wing was revamped because of its effectiveness as a versatile fighter and its relative newness. The Y-wing was older and slower and more suited as a bomber and not deemed worth revamping - or it wasn't shown simply because it wasn't appropriate for that battle. That's just my two cents though!

Edit: to clarify, the X-wing was regarded as a highly capable and versatile fighter. It was quick, powerful, and shielded; it was capable of extended sublight travel due to life support systems, a astromech copilot, and a storage area. It was further capable of hyperspace travel, unlike the TIE fighter. It was the perfect fighter - it would make sense to revamp the T65 to the T70. The main opposing force seen at the Starkiller battle would be other dog fighters and turrets; a perfect enciroment for the agile X wing. The Y wing would be simply too much of a sitting duck in such an environment compared to the T70. Sorry for the wall of text!",2015-12-22 00:21:31+00:00,cy777vu,1,t3_3xrgki,4998,MawInstallation

If you don't like Gibsons and Epiphones because of a problem thats solved by 1) using your hands and some awareness or 2) just going string by string to replace them, then you have to reevaluate the principles you hold about them.

This means that if you have music to learn, you can learn it on the lowest 4 strings of the guitar, just ignore the highest two strings, and be playing the exact same thing as on bass (just an octave higher). Theres no chords on bass, you always just play single notes. To get started, its very important to (start) learn the notes at least on the lowest two strings, the E and the A. While sheet music is fantastic, TAB is better if you're starting out. Each line corresponds to a string, highest at the top and lowest at the bottom. The numbers tell you which fret to press down on. So if there's a number 3 on the lowest line, then you play at the 3rd fret of the lowest string. ",2015-08-27 13:17:10+00:00,cuhella,3,t1_cuhe8nz,766,Guitar

320,"Well a bass guitar is just the lowest four strings of a guitar, E A D and G. So you can practice bass parts on a regular guitar using just these strings. Of course, a bass has thicker strings, larger frets, and a different picking/fingering style so you won't be able to get accustomed to playing bass with just a guitar, but it's useful for learning the part. I had the same situation some years back when I was asked to play bass and sing for a song for a friend of mine in a show. I didn't have a bass, I didn't play bass, but I learned it on guitar then borrowed his bass when I could to get a feel for it before the show.

I've been looking to get another main electric and I think I found it in this tele. Besides it's playability, I was impressed by it's versatility of tone with 3 pickups and a coil split humbucker  at the bridge. Another solid guitar in that price range is the Epiphone G-400 PRO (their SG). I played that also and was also impressed by the fast neck and broad tone from two coil tap humbuckers. It's really up to personal preference though; I preferred the Tele because it's more of a change from my LP, which presents many new options, and because it better suits my image in a jazz ensemble!",2015-07-30 04:47:17+00:00,ctl7nyb,1,t3_3f4dr7,1718,Guitar

I'm not sure how modern Ovations are (mine is from the 70s, passed down to me). My only notes are that the shape of it takes some adjusting to before it becomes comfortable and that the action tends to be stiff with heavier gauge strings. Besides that though, they are fantastic and well built guitars
