Right now I have a Fender Champion 100, but it just isn't doing it for me. After going from a small tube amp (original 1962 Champ) to a big solid state, it just doesn't feel right. As much as I want a Fender Deluxe Reverb, I don't have $1200 lying around. So I've set my sights on a Deville, since there are some in my area on craigslist selling for a reasonable price ($300-500). I've played a Deville before and loved it and I've heard a lot of good things about them. It's also big enough that I'll probably never have to worry about my volume. But the real question is; 2x12 or 4x10? Personally, a 4x10 appeals to me more because it's a little different and won't be as bassy, but I want to hear what you guys think about the amp and about which configuration is best. For reference, I'm prospectively majoring in jazz guitar, so that's my main area but I also play blues, rock, and folk for fun.",Guitar,Feelings on Fender Deville/2x12 vs 4x10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/3jshbn/feelings_on_fender_deville2x12_vs_4x10/

The guitar and bass is me playing through an iRig Pro (not ideal, but it does the job), but the drums I cheated on, they're a software instrument. This is really my first song to call my own, so I would really love some feedback from you guys! It's kinda rough around the edges, I did it in garageband in a few hours. Eventually I want to make it a more fully formed thought, with clearer transitions and lyrics, but for now I'm happy with the product. Again, I would love some feedback, especially tips and criticisms because if I wanted to hear nothing but praise I'd just play it for my mom. (""Gee honey, that was great! Did you do that?"")

It was the best feeling in the world to look at these songs that were so hard a few years ago and be able to learn them in a few minutes! I hadn't really known I had been improving so much UNTIL I looked at what was once difficult to me, applied myself, and put it in perspective.

A few other things; how much of a difference is there between the coil tap on the Standard HSS and the coil split on the Lone Star Strat and is the difference between maple and rosewood really that important?
