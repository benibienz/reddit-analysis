So it all started back in march when I was looking for a roof basket for my R56 cooper s. I found the basket from crap industries which was $499 which was just for raw metal. I also bought a spare tire mount for the basket which was another $89.95 and then $125 for shipping. On my order for I wrote in the instructions that it was for an r56 mini using OEM mini roof rails. (which anyone making custom parts for a mini know they are not adjustable) So my order was placed on March 12th I then got the runaround of it will be shipping soon and its almost done until May 7th when it showed up at my door. Then here is where the fun happens. It doesn't fit it is probably 2 1/2 feet bigger than the roof of my car and none of the mounting bars lined up. So i contact them and they tell me that i never stated that my car had a spoiler or that my roof rails weren't adjustable. ( which once again anyone that specializes in mini coopers know those things) They stopped replying to my on May 13th. The basket that i received looked nothing like the one that they were advertising on there show car, which was an r56 mini cooper that used OEM roof rails. The welds were very sloppy(some of which had holes in them),the bars also had metal welded inside of them so it would rattle around. I have been fighting with the credit card company to get my money back from this awful product that i never used. They told me i had to ship the item back to crap industries which was another $203 and now they are saying tough shit. So I'm out a roof basket and about $920. They really live up to there name. If anyone is interested i can post pictures as well.",cars,Experiences with crap industries (x-post r/mini),https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/3olmr2/experiences_with_crap_industries_xpost_rmini/
