Should I refuse to do the tech work till I am properly trained and get the pay raise to a Certified tech?

A little bit of background. I am yes an 18 year old male dating a girl who I have been wanting to date for a year and half! We have been dating for ~3 months (Kinda hard to put a date on things because we kinda just happened).

Anyways to get to the point of me making this post is to ask you guys some key questions on my emotions. A little bit about my ex's. I have been cheated on twice (one that broke me down the most was with my ex who I dated for a year), I have been pushed around by females for I am a very kind guy and try to be as open as possible in relationships. The reason I came here is to see if its a common thing to be constantly afraid that my S.O. will cheat on me?

Now when I say always I mean it usually never leaves my mind. I really don't want to make the impression that I don't trust my girlfriend! (&lt;--- Point made right here). I trust my girlfriend more than most people and really don't want to freak her out by telling her about my problem. Now to be clear as well she only adds flame to my fear. 

Prime example: She recently went on vacation and was I was very limited to talking to her for a week (Let me say I was a mess). After finally being able to talk to her I asked her how her trip was going and what she was up to, she immediately started on a story where she waved at some guys and the guys in response ran after her and her friend to hit on them. I keep my calm about i but let me tell you inside I was losing my mind. Eventually I told her and yes we did work everything out.

It's gotten to the point where she says she going parting with her friends and I can't talk to her my mind is going a million miles a minute thinking of what could be going on. I don't tell her about it because of the risk I freak her out and mess it up but I don't know what to do.

So my main question to you guys is there anyway I can stop this feeling? I have tried everything from hanging with my friends to just simple hobbies. My mind always wonders right back to her.

Edit: Quick post her on the past between us. Yes I have dated her before and yes she has broken up with me before. I swore I would never talk to her again after what she did (She told me she loved me and 5 days later decided she didn't). About 4-5 months ago she texted me and she just wanted to talk about things which I did. Now we are here.

   
TL:DR : Having extreme feelings of loss when girlfriend mentions anything about another guy or parties. Don't want to tell her because I don't want to be controlling or scare her. What should I do to calm my mind about it or help me get over it?",relationships,Me [18 M] need help with my relationship with my girlfriend [18F],http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3bprya/me_18_m_need_help_with_my_relationship_with_my/
