9,"1) Pretty sure its freestyle
2) Yes ofcourse you can, but it also depends on the artist, some artist do only a certain type so its best to do some research before you ink.
3) Some do, a couple artist charge so they don't waste their time, i have come across a couple artist like this and usually those are pretty decent artist, some times they are not.
4) HOURS! More than one sitting FOR SURE! 
5) I would say to wait because just like gaining weight, loose skin will dangle and that will be a problem especially if you want it to look a certain way, don't want that just in case you think of getting some plastic surgery to remove that excess skin.

Other players refuse to raid with a static due to the scheduling or refuse to deal with the personalities of the members, so I can see how those numbers are that low.

421,"Thank you for making this thread, I have never played an Uncharted or a Tomb Raider game until last month, Tomb Raider definitive edition went on sale after E3 and I immediately bought. I totally love Lara Croft and will 100% pick up the next tomb raider game when it comes to ps4. As for uncharted, I already preordered the collection that comes out in a  couple months and I can not wait to play it. Seeing as both have a lot of similarities, I should totally enjoy Uncharted. :) ",2015-07-09 17:33:21+00:00,csxmgb1,1,t3_3cmjjq,56466,TombRaider
