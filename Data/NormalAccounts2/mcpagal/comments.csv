You have to admit, although there's nothing unislamic about first cousins marrying, the fact that he's a close relative makes this situation different to if it was a random suitor. Her whole family knows both of them, there's family ties that could be strained by her rejection of him, it'll go down in family lore. It was a really insensitive and poorly thought out thing for him to make his profession of love so publicly and with the fact that he's related, I can see why /u/tobeyounger would be angry and humiliated.

30,"My knee jerk reaction would be 'uhh no what the hell are you on about, south Asian dudes (especially doctors) have it wayyyy easier than women'... But recently I've understood that _it's not a competition_. We don't have to compete over who has it tougher, and by always trying we get blinded to the fact other people have it tough too. 

With that in mind I find it easier to admit that for years I had it in my mind that as a south Asian woman (Pakistani), I pretty much never wanted to marry a south Asian dude. This isn't because I found them unattractive or low status or whatever - it's purely because I saw so many negative aspects of South Asian culture around me, and it led me to dread the prospect of a desi husband - and more importantly, a desi mother in law. I also had developed so much disdain for desi dudes I met at uni etc because I found them arrogant and I resented how easy guys seem to have it in our culture. 

Anyway. More recently I think I've matured and I've moved past that. I still wouldn't ever want to marry someone heavily tied to the 'traditional' culture or whose family was that way. But marrying outside has its issues and they're not minor. I think it come down to 'the grass is always greener ~~on the other side~~ if you marry a white person' and that's just not true. 

I just wanted you to know that people marrying or wanting to marry outside of your culture isn't because they think you're lower than them - but that there's other baggage and issues. Also, bringing diversity and merging cultures is a good thing, so please don't resent people for doing it, it's not a personal slight. You're probably overlooking the fact that in the vast majority of cases, people stick to their own culture anyway - so you're not going to fall by the wayside. Just work on being the best person you can be and inshallah when the time comes you'll marry the best person for you, and then you can ignore what everyone else is up to.

I think that's a major motivator for people in that position to marry a practising Muslim - they can still maintain a pretence/double life to their family. The problem is that often their propensity to lie carries on to their spouse. It's such a red flag, living a double life.

It's not exactly the correct intention for avoiding sin but I would still hate to see that last barrier (family related guilt/shame) fall away and such sins become really openly accepted. I know we have to be honest about the fact that these things go on, and be more proactive about bringing these people back to the deen, it's a balance between loving the sinner and hating the sin I guess.

I just wanted to add that one way of understanding where you're at is to look at where you've been - you said you started looking at 17, but can now see that you were not mature enough back then. You're now 22, perhaps whatever age you get married at (whether it's in 6 months or 6 years) you'll look back at this point in your life and see that there's some wisdom at you being single right now.

From my personal experience: I had to take soooo many breaks from the process. It becomes wearing in so many different ways. I decided along the way to make my life decisions based on what's best for my deen and personal and professional development, not my marriage potential. Alhamdulillah that led me to a much happier, more content, more well rounded place.

'So and so has started wearing hijab, she's just doing it to impress a boy'
'Who does she think she is, we all know what she's really like, she can't just pretend to be religious after all that'
'She's going to have a hard time getting married, boys these days are looking for a modern girl'

About non hijabis:
'I'm worried about her iman' (you rarely hear this about people who lack strength in maintaining prayer etc)

I've not heard as much criticism of non hijabis as I have of hijabis tbh. And on both sides, it's usually women making these comments rather than men.

106,"I'm not sure of your sources, as what you're saying contradicts anything I've heard on the subject, and even your own source (if you don't like the 'urf/prior agreement reasoning, there's more:)

&gt;The third opinion is that nafaqah is based on the ‘aqd and therefore she is deserving of the maintenance even if she is working (with or without her husband’s permission). This one is the opinion held by some Hanafis.  There are also some contemporary scholars that have this view.

To respond to your own comments:

&gt;It also makes the most sense in a modern context when you have Muslim women who are brainwashed by Feminism who believe they are entitled to work and entitled to keep all of their earnings.

You come across as if you're living in an angry, MRA/redpill themed echo chamber and not the real world. If you look at Muslim communities in western countries, the issues affecting marriages are generally nothing to do with feminism or men being denied their rights. Statistics show Muslim women in the U.K. have the lowest rate of employment of any group, so your picture of Muslim wives hoarding their own earnings while spending their husbands' is mostly your imagination. Muslim women who work generally do so with the full approval of their husbands, because the economy is such that most families need dual incomes to afford a house - if that's an agreement they've come to, that's perfectly acceptable. Issues that come up are often that women don't want to work but have to, or that women have to contribute their earnings to their inlaws or husbands with no say in the matter. You might run into a lot of feminists online but Muslim women, even in the west, often don't have a huge degree of financial independence. 

&gt;I mean, this has to be the case, right? If you are making an intellectually honest argument based on 'urf and not one based on your sense of entitlement to work and your sense of entitlement to make the man pay for everything. 

What other couples agree to in their marriages, in other cultures and countries, with their full consent and without transgressing the boundaries Islam has set, is their business. My personal opinion on how I want to live my life is between me and my future husband iA, and I would discuss it fully before marriage. And just for the record, I have no intention of making a man pay for everything - It's not a sense of entitlement that I have but a knowledge of my rights, and of the value in spending my own money.",2016-09-23 10:33:39+00:00,d7yojmj,4.0,t1_d7yhjsi,21462.0,islam

108,"&gt; Excerpted from notes on a Fiqh of Marriage class taught by Jamal Zarabozo.

It's interesting that the notes you've excerpted detail 7 opinions, and you've only chosen to quote the opinions where the husband can refuse to maintain his wife or refuse to allow her to work, and chosen to ignore the ones that don't back you up, e.g.:

&gt;The fifth opinion goes back to whether this was something that was agreed upon via the ‘aqd either explicitly, by ‘urf or if it was not agreed upon.  What is meant by this, before you get married, the woman could say that she is going to work.  This could be implied or be explicit.  Or maybe the ‘urf is such that the women are known to work.  In any of those cases, teh default case is that the wife is deserving of nafaqah.  If on top of that by contract or ‘urf she will be working, she still gets her nafaqah.  However, if they agreed upon that she wouldn’t work or if the ‘urf is that she won’t work, in that case she is not deserving of nafaqah.  This goes back to the question regarding how they entered the contract and what agreement they had in the contract.

...

&gt;The spirit of the law can only be fulfilled after fulfilling the letter of the law.

That's... the opposite of the point the shaykh in the OP was making. Yes the letter of the law might be that a woman working against her husband's will would be forfeiting some of her rights - but the spirit of marriage is love and rahma, and if both parties treat it like a bookkeeping exercise instead they're already in trouble or doomed to failure.

164,"&gt;In terms of prayer let me put this question to you. Are you confident in the ability of brothers to lower their gaze in the mosque without a stronger barrier? Can you say this comfortably considering the modern standards of dressing? And when you consider the exposure to the outside world and the fitnah that exists, do you think that bad habits light not leak into a mosque? 

Honestly? I'd hope I could trust brothers who attend  the mosque to lower their gaze more than I can trust random men on the street. I wouldn't feel exposed at all in the mosque, given that men are generally in front at all times anyway. There's little segregation required during hajj/umrah. Also, even in strictly partitioned women only sections I have rarely if ever seen an inappropriately dressed muslimah. 

&gt;The opposite questions are also important, such as do women have proper access to get questions answered? Or to account oppressive leadership? 

I think these are the kinds of issues that could be resolved by having women less distanced from the main prayer halls in mosques. In my experience, women in really strictly segregated mosques have less opportunity to engage. Plus there's practical benefits of having everybody in one hall too - generally women behave better when they're in one hall (so there's less chatter and mess), and for children it's easier for them to go between either parent rather than if everyone is separate.

185,"&gt;The commentators say that there is a direct relation between doing righteous works and eating pure foods. In this context, purity means that both the food itself and its source is pure.

I think it's really interesting that the commentators put a lot of emphasis on purity of both the food and its source. Generally Muslims have a visceral reaction to blatantly haram foods, but wouldn't feel so strongly if you were to tell them that food purchased with haram income was also haram, or that the burger they just ate was from a cow that lived and died in an inhumane way.

186,"Meat being cheap and ubiquitous these days is really closely tied to the practices that make it questionable in terms of how halal/tayyib it is - feed containing animal products and hormones, animal cruelty, production line abattoirs where animals are tied up and can see other animals dying. 

I don't think I'd go as far as the author and go vegetarian, but I think it is important for Muslims to take more of an interest in animal welfare and really examine if they're comfortable with where the 'halal' meat they eat comes from and how it's produced. I have heard of [this farm](http://www.willowbrookorganic.org/) in England that takes a lot of this stuff into consideration, but people complain that their prices are more expensive - I think that's quite telling, because doing things right inevitably costs more money and would lead to meat being eaten more rarely, which is more in keeping with the sunnah anyway.

I hate this question so much. Why is it assumed that women are only truly choosing what to wear when they choose to wear less? Or that 'western' modes of dress are completely free of patriarchal constructs or oppression when the fashion industry is so heavily saturated with rich white men? If you try and tell these people that most Muslim women choose what to put on their bodies each day with no coercion or fear of repercussions, they'll tell you that it's a societal thing and not ever _really_ their choice, because obviously women who cover never have any agency, and women who don't cover make all their decisions free of societal influence 🙄",2016-09-13 20:28:33+00:00,d7lhlz7,1.0,t3_52lapv,15354.0,Hijabis

From my understanding, for it to be considered khulwa they're not just alone together, but in a place where there's no possibility of being seen or someone intruding on them. So for example, a man and woman could end up in an elevator together alone - but this wouldn't be an issue because someone else could come in at any moment. I would personally assume that also applies to a workplace, however if I felt unsafe or that my colleague was taking things the wrong way, I'd just leave and finish my work later or at home. 

Alcohol is annoyingly difficult to avoid.

&gt;He gave the litany of Muslim-related terrorist attacks in France, directed *at* the French, specifically for their French and European values, over the past year or so.

Were Muslim women wearing burkinis responsible for any of these attacks? Would stopping women covering up on the beach have prevented any of them? Should ordinary Muslims be punished and have their rights curtailed because of the actions of people they don't agree with, just because they shared the same religion? 

&gt;I thought his point was fair. If you aren't interested in French culture and being part of it, why live in France? Why live in any country other than the one you left, if that's the culture you prefer?

who says that these women have left another country? Many Muslim women have been born and raised in France, what country should they go back to? Would you leave your country if you disagreed with the direction of your government? It's sad that in a democracy that values Liberty so highly, citizens of that country are being told they should leave rather than exercise their democratic rights.



&gt;And are these women truly wearing these clothes because they've made a religious choice, or because they're required to by their male relatives? He seemed to think the latter, based on conversations in his official capacity with many women over a period of time.

I've heard this argument so many times. Do you truly think that every woman who wears a bikini has made that choice completely free of the influence of society and customs around her? You hear so many women talking about pressure to have a beach body, to get bikini ready before going on holiday - that to me seems oppressive, but I would never advocate banning women from wearing what they want to on the beach when it's a choice that they're making. People are very keen to deny Muslim women of any agency, it's always implied that men or culture dictate what they wear - well, the man in the interview had anecdotal evidence to state that, I have plenty more from my life experience to tell me that most Muslim women in the west dress according to their own choices and decisions.

I agree. I worry that the research saying that stunning is less traumatic is actually driven by the industry that wants to kill more animals more quickly and in a more streamlined way however - if proper halal slaughter guidelines were followed, it would be incredibly laborious, because there are additional rules such as that the animals shouldn't see the instruments that are going to kill them, or see any other animals being killed.

Also, when I made the point about concern only being about how animals die, it's more to do with looking at the reasons why halal slaughter always hits the headlines - it gets people's backs up who don't usually have anything at all to say about animal welfare, or object in any way to kosher slaughter, so it smells pretty strongly of an objection to Muslims as opposed to a genuine care about animals.

Also when I've seen pictures of chickens getting electrocuted on a conveyor belt, it really seems that stunning is more about speeding up the slaughter process than about any concerns for animal welfare. 

What's baffling to me that the discourse around this topic is always about halal meat, which is usually from stunned animals in the UK, despite the above concerns, rather than kosher meat which is never stunned.

You've met her and obviously liked her looks (and hopefully, personality) enough to consider marrying her, but you're now going to make or break that decision based on how she looks without her hair covered. Muslim women are generally told that Islam protects us, that wearing hijab is not only modest but an opposition to society's desire for us to be shallow and superficial - if I was in the situation you're putting this girl through, I'd feel heartbroken that there's Muslims that don't understand this. 

I don't know how long she's worn hijab for, but it will be out of her comfort zone to be seen without it, so she's going to feel uncomfortable and exposed without it on in front of a non mahram regardless of how good she looks.

247,"&gt;Do you speak from experience? I can't comprehend how such an absolute statement can be made with such certainty by someone who hasn't experienced it themselves. I mean, you've got all these people saying they had an amazing, fulfilling, happy marital life and you're like, ""Nope, you guys are just wrong."" I can't speak for the marriages you may know, but I hope you're not insinuating that marriage is only about sex or that sex is only about lust. 

Although it's true that marriage isn't just about sex, you can't deny that it's a part of it, and that being sexually fulfilled in a marriage is a basic right for both parties. That's why I talked about informed consent - if both parties are frank and open, and know from the outset that the goals and course of the marriage aren't standard, that the relationship will not be the norm - that's their decision and no one else's to judge or criticise. But that would need for society to be much more open and accepting about sexuality that is outside the norm, or even just talking about sexuality in general. Can you imagine that chat going down in a rishta visit? 

Most of the stories presented are where one party realises they have homosexual desires after marriage and having children, then the couple make a conscious decision to stay together. That's also their decision and I don't even want to say 'that's acceptable' because it's not for me to accept. 

What *is* wrong though, is for parents/people/society to emotionally or religiously compel people who consider themselves gay with no interest at all in the opposite sex, to marry someone of the opposite sex _without informing them of the situation_ in hopes that they can have a happy and fulfilling marriage and have children like in the anecdotes mentioned. Yes it can happen, and it might even happen regardless of consent, but morally it's still not right. ",2016-07-23 05:29:10+00:00,d5ncjuu,3.0,t1_d5n2e16,19431.0,islam
248,"&gt;Because Islam does not allow homosexual marriages. 

So they shouldn't marry. Is there any evidence from the Qur'an/Sunnah that marriages like the one described should be encouraged?

&gt;Either you are heterosexual, bisexual, or homosexual (you can add asexual in there if you like). There is no spectrum when it comes to these labels.  

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_scale

&gt;Then they shouldn't have married them. Doesn't mean women or men should be generalized based off what you have seen.

I don't mean to generalise. I think the article is interesting as an opinion piece, but pitching it as a successful life plan for Muslims who are homosexual is seriously flawed. As a purely hypothetical, academic exercise then yes it can make sense. It's different if you're talking about both parties being fully informed and consenting to the arrangement before making a commitment, but due to the stigma associated with openly discussing sexuality amongst Muslims that's not the way these things generally happen.

1. I don't understand how this article is relevant to r/Islam

2. Sexuality isn't binary, but a spectrum, so 'gay' people in heterosexual relationships isn't that surprising

3. Encouraging or emotionally compelling people who have absolutely no sexual interest in the opposite gender to marry someone of the opposite gender is just wrong. It's such a selfish thing for them to do if they don't fully explain the situation and basically get informed consent - their spouse ends up with someone who can't sexually satisfy them or be satisfied by them. 

4. I've seen young women struggle with marriages to gay men where the guys' parents thought marriage would 'fix' them and the blame for the situation lands squarely on the girl.

250,"You've made the mistake of taking a bunch of attitudes/questions/posts related to marriage, amalgamating them into one amorphous strawman, and are now trying to pick it apart and argue against it. 

The fact is, some women will expect a man to pay them a massive mahr. Some will expect a financially stable man, others take that to mean a fully paid off house and a massive salary. Some people put more value on the deen, and will have stringent requirements with regard to how practising a potential spouse is. All these criteria will sound overwhelming until you realise that it's not that every woman has the full set of criteria, but that people value different traits to different degrees - and the same goes for men in what they value in women. 

Alhamdulillah, it's not your duty to change people's priorities if they don't align with yours. You just move on and find someone whose priorities and attitudes to marriage align with your own. Other commenters have talked about what men and women should bring to the table but I think that's missing the point - everyone will have a slightly different take on things and mine is that gender roles aren't prescriptive, they describe an average arrangement but there are many situations that differ from the mean but that are still perfectly acceptable to the parties involved.

You said you feel like you need to make this right somehow. But you can't. That's between your sister and your parents, and ultimately, between your sister and God. Your role in this isn't to fix things - it's just not possible and you'll frustrate yourself if you try.

You might want to tell your parents but again, that's not your role. And long term, will it help anybody? 

I don't know your relationship but your sister confided in you, not anyone else, and maybe not consciously, but it was for a reason. It means she has some level of trust in you, or respect for you, or that she's reaching out to you or that she just needs you to know.

Immigration is a net benefit to the UK economy. We have an ageing population, the majority of welfare is spent on pensions and healthcare for the elderly, unemployment, disability and child benefit are minuscule in comparison. I'm not against immigration, the U.K. govt sorting out tax avoidance and corporation tax would make me a lot happier. It's nonsense to say immigrant send all their money back home - they spend it here; they get taxed on it here; and they contribute to the economy here.

Healthcare: the NHS would haemorrhage staff if we restricted EU immigration. That would be a much more massive risk to the future of free healthcare than immigration is. 

I'm not really looking to debate with you. I know which way I'm voting on Thursday. The only benefit I can see if we leave the EU is that Scotland might get another shot at independence.

That's exactly how I feel after hearing stereotypical gendered jokes at conferences etc - the shuyookh may mean it as light hearted and ironic, but in most of our communities misogyny is still a major issue so the listeners may read the jokes as backing for their backward beliefs about women (and men).

352,"I don't think you should go to her wedding when you're feeling this way. If I was getting married, I wouldn't want anyone there who had any ill will against me. In fact, I wouldn't want anyone like that in my life in general. 

As for making excuses, don't tell any lies obviously - I would just say 'oh sorry, something has come up and I can't make it to your wedding' somewhere nearer the time when she's too busy to question it. 

Then take some time to work on your issues. I wrote this list out for a comment in a thread that got deleted the other day so I'm kind of recycling but here are some points to bear in mind:

1. Jealousy/envy is a disease of the heart, and needs treatment. You can't just wish it away. Do some reading and work on cleansing your heart with dua, Qur'an and dhikr. Make dua for the people you feel jealous of to counteract any badness you might have inadvertently wished on them.

2. Jealousy comes down to comparing yourself to others and that's a really destructive thing to do. If you compare yourself to those with more than you, you get envious. If you compare yourself to those with less, you could get arrogant. Instead, realise that everybody starts out with a different set of abilities, challenges and trials - you might wish for all the good they've been given, but if you knew their full circumstances then you might take that back. Plus, what a person starts out with isn't important - it's how they develop and use it. So focus on counting your own blessings, and make the intention to use them as best you can in the path of Allah. 

3. Lowering your gaze isn't just for the opposite sex. Society is incredibly superficial and image conscious so it's easy to get into the habit of ogling other women (not in a lusty way but still). Be mindful of the fact that women should still have hayah and an awrah in front of other women (navel to knee). Stop consuming media that's focussed on the exterior - for me that meant deleting a lot of 'fitness' focussed Instagram users after I realised it wasn't fitness they were promoting, just the ability to look good in very little clothing.

4. Shaytan preys on idle minds. Occupy yourself with something other than the superficial. Find some projects or hobbies you find enjoyable and fulfilling, and inshallah that will help your focus change.

5. Hijab isn't just about the exterior, but one of the benefits of it is that it can help take the exterior out of the equation. Try and adhere to it and constantly renew your intention.

May Allah help you with the problems you've been facing and reward you abundantly :)

353,"'Castes' are commonly found in desi cultures (I know Indians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis who have talked about wanting to marry within their own 'caste') but it's not a caste system religiously speaking - i.e. different castes don't imply different levels of faith or closeness to God. 

It mostly comes up in a marriage context and people wanting to ~~inbreed~~  
marry within their own caste. It's similar to clan systems that are in some Arab cultures in that regard. However, there is cultural baggage that comes with it (among Pakistanis at least) - ""oh they're only X caste, they're not Y like us, their daughter can never marry our son"" or whatever.

354,"Honestly, I think you'd be creating far more social complications for yourself by finding excuses than by just telling the truth. I get that you need to find a way to phrase it - 'I'm not allowed because of my religion' is inviting people who don't respect your religion to get you to try and bend your rules or as you said, to 'liberate' you. But by making excuses, you get into the situation of having to think of something new and convincing each time a situation comes up, rather than developing a reputation of having a moral stance on a subject. You'll also make things easier for other Muslims in your circle by being honest because non-Muslims will have more understanding of our boundaries, making them easier to adhere to inshallah.

I've found it more effective (and more conducive to discussion) to explain the reasoning and then bring that on to a discussion about Islam if the person is interested.

E.g. ""Hey you want to come out for drinks with us tonight?""

""Nah sorry, I don't drink and I'm never comfortable socialising around alcohol. If you're ever arranging anything without it though, I'd love to come!""

And that's led onto discussions about why I don't drink, the dangers of alcohol and intoxicants, how Islam prohibited alcohol in stages much like how smoking nowadays is being eradicated through public health measures... 

Or for your example, ""hey you're super hot, will you go out with me?""* 
^^*having never formally been asked out that's just how I assume it goes^^

""Thanks, but I should explain that I don't believe in any premarital relationships, it just wouldn't feel right to me - you're great though, it's nothing to do with you in particular!""

357,"What you're jealous about comes down to what you value in life, and what you base your self esteem on, and what you ultimately want to strive towards. The things you've mentioned feeling jealous about are all very superficial - being pretty, getting male attention, having a good figure and big boobs. Have you thought about why these things are so important to you? 

A few things to realise:

1. Jealousy/envy is a disease of the heart, and needs treatment. You can't just wish it away. Do some reading and work on cleansing your heart with dua, Qur'an and dhikr. Make dua for the people you feel jealous of to counteract any badness you might have inadvertently wished on them.

2. Jealousy comes down to comparing yourself to others and that's a really destructive thing to do. If you compare yourself to those with more than you, you get envious. If you compare yourself to those with less, you could get arrogant. Instead, realise that everybody starts out with a different set of abilities, challenges and trials - you might wish for all the good they've been given, but if you knew their full circumstances then you might take that back. Plus, what a person starts out with isn't important - it's how they develop and use it. So focus on counting your own blessings, and make the intention to use them as best you can in the path of Allah. 

3. Lowering your gaze isn't just for the opposite sex. Society is incredibly superficial and image conscious so it's easy to get into the habit of ogling other women (not in a lusty way but still). Be mindful of the fact that women should still have hayah and an awrah in front of other women (navel to knee). Stop consuming media that's focussed on the exterior - for me that meant deleting a lot of 'fitness' focussed Instagram users after I realised it wasn't fitness they were promoting, just the ability to look good in very little clothing.

4. Shaytan preys on idle minds. Occupy yourself with something other than the superficial. Find some projects or hobbies you find enjoyable and fulfilling, and inshallah that will help your focus change.

5. Hijab isn't just about the exterior, but one of the benefits of it is that it can help take the exterior out of the equation. Try and adhere to it and constantly renew your intention.

May Allah help you with the problems you've been facing and reward you abundantly :)

I also think it's somewhat futile - it's coming to the forefront of discussions because Ramadan is now in the longest days of the year, but alhamdulillah most people are managing the 'dominant view' of fasting times with no ill effect, or undue hardship, so justifying a change to the status quo would be nigh on impossible.

Basically that it seems very arbitrary - how is it decided how long a day has to be before implementing shorter times? Why is it shortened down to Madina time instead of the last acceptable local fast, or the nearest country that has sensible day and night lengths? 

I understand that people might not be able to cope with the length of fasts (and obviously at some latitudes it's just completely out of the question) but there are other adjustments that can be made - taking a later calculation for fajr time, shortening tarawih prayers for example. 

Besides, the length of a fast isn't what makes things dangerous necessarily. Over the last couple of years there were deaths cause by the combination of heat and fasting in Pakistan for example, so surely it's important to make allowances for people fasting in extreme heat rather than (or maybe as well as) people fasting for longer times but in more temperate climates.

He had people treat him worse than anything we can expect to experience in our lifetimes, and he didn't close himself off to them like anyone else would have done. 

Also, to be more altruistic, you need to start doing what is right and better without ever keeping tabs. If you give someone money or a gift, consider it spent and never expect to see anything back. If you help someone, don't even expect their gratitude.

Yes, marriage comes with compromise and difficulty - but if it was all easygoing and stress free, it would have less reward.

415,"Where in the UK are you? I'm pretty far north and have never seen 1.01 for fajr. Where I am, some mosques use 1.33 all summer but because of the hardship, all the mosques locally take a more lenient option during ramadan. This is because there are multiple ways of gauging fajr time when there's no visible dawn, so other methods are used - differing degrees of the sun to the horizon, or dividing the night into thirds, or estimating a certain amount of time before sunrise. 

Going with the more lenient options gives you a couple more hours, at least to be able to eat iftar, read tarawih and eat suhoor before starting again. It's been this way last year and although it's difficult it's still manageable. Fasting with middle eastern times seems arbitrary (the other concession I've heard is fasting with the nearest Muslim country with proper dawn and sunset times so Morocco rather than Saudi time) but no one I know has ever had to take this concession. Obviously if fasting this long was a hazard to your health you shouldn't do it, but if not then have tawakkul that you can do it inshallah.

433,"Despite being a hijab wearing woman, I found this article really difficult to relate to. 

&gt;Many years later, I would like to hope that Sayyida Fatima heard my cry, because now, all praise belongs to Allah, my Hijaab is still with me. And not just as a cloth or an obligation to be upheld, but as the dearest piece of my identity; the very life force that breathes within me.

I don't really get the idea of hijab as a life force or defining part of one's identity. In Muslim societies, and historically even in non Muslim countries, women covering their heads was often the norm - it's not always been something that's unique, or a struggle. Even when it is, when you've been wearing it a long time then it does just become normalised (not saying it's easy, but it can definitely become habitual). 

I feel like putting so much weight on your dress, defining your identity by it, pulling your life force from it - it's all just the flip side and reaction to superficial societies that place so much stake in how women look. It's playing the same game, instead of saying that the game doesn't matter, that women can be defined by who they *are* and how they treat others rather than how they appear, what they choose to wear or not. 

Obviously modesty is an important trait, it beautifies character and is so emphasised in the Qur'an and Sunnah - but physical covering is such a tiny part of what modesty actually is. These points are touched on in the article, I know.

Kids should be kids and not have to worry about how covered they are or what people think of them. It's the same way I feel about little kids dressing/looking like adults before their time in any other way, like if they have heels and nail polish or makeup or sexualised clothing - it just makes me sad because they've lost that innocent carefree part of your childhood where you have no concept of what you look like and all you want to do is play.

&gt;The more I reflect on this verse, the more I get a small glimpse into the infinite wisdom in these words. Specifically, five points stand out to me:
1. Allah is addressing only men in this verse.
2. No advice or instructions are given to women regarding plural marriage.
3. Allah is asking men to engage in careful introspection when determining whether or not to pursue polygamy.
4. The last part of the verse clearly implies that marrying more than one woman results in increased responsibility (and thus accountability) as opposed to marrying only one woman.
5. The last part also suggests that polygamy itself will be a challenge—so much so that Allah tells men outright that being married to only one increase the likelihood of the man being just to his wife.

But the haramness (actual word) comes in when marriage isn't the goal and things are just vague like 'I like you so let's spend more time together', because we're told to stay away from zina and anything that could potentially lead to it. 

Even though you could start out with the best of intentions ('halal' dating, never being in seclusion with him), it's likely that things would start seeming more tempting or you'd make justifications to break the rules you set.

They compared it to any other hypothetical situation in which the law in a western country preventing something else that's allowed but not mandatory in the shariah - for example eating chicken. You'd still follow the law of the land, even if you didn't agree with it, because it's not a mandatory thing to do.

I found this from [here](http://www.islamawareness.net/Polygamy/fatwa001.html) though:

&gt;Sheikh Ahmad Hulail, imam of Tariq ibn Ziad Mosque in Frankfort, Germany, states: With regard to the Muslim man who has a second wife, I believe—and Almighty Allah knows best—that he has to follow the channels of law in order to legalize his second marriage in the country he lives in.

&gt; Dr. Jamal Badawi, professor at Saint Mary's University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada and member of the Fiqh Council of North America, adds: ... A Muslim living in a non-Muslim society is obligated to follow the laws. We cannot say that their laws are contrary to the Shari`ah, so we have to follow the Shari`ah. Taking a second wife is not a necessary requirement; there is no mandatory duty on the Muslim to have a second wife. If a person has become a resident or a citizen in a European country, it is a condition for him to abide by its laws. When a Muslim man in a European country sticks to not having a second wife, it is like giving up a particular right according to his own Shari`ah. The person who has a second wife could be subject to criminal punishment. 

They also mentioned the contradiction between the law allowing adultery/homosexuality and incriminating polygamy, but said that the latter might not change any time soon purely because of the complexity of legal issues more than moral objections (after all 'polyamorous' relationships are becoming more prevalently open/discussed).

I mentioned in my other comment that in terms of equal treatment, yes they could just have an Islamic nikah with multiple wives, but they would have no legal rights to things like tax breaks and benefits so it would affect basic things like accommodation and upkeep. Until as recently as 2004 in the UK the father of a child had to be married to the mother at the time of birth to have parental rights to his children so that was also an issue. 

If he registered a marriage to one and not the other(s) then their treatment would be unequal. Anecdotally, I've met people who have run into issues with this, especially when the one wife lives abroad.

I'm not a convert (so probably not as helpful to you as /u/mmae) but I feel like one month is a really short time to be this hard on yourself. People born and raised on the deen take time to process and follow Islamic rules and guidelines, and none of us can say we do so perfectly. I think you should be easier on yourself and try and build up your iman and the basics first - establishing salah especially. You cover your head to pray 5 times a day and inshallah that habit will help you get used to seeing yourself in hijab and associating it with something meaningful and positive. Both things go hand in hand - if and when you do wear hijab regularly you might find it helps remind you of your obligation to pray. Also dua helps immensely with easing the anxiety and panic that comes from feeling that you're inadequate or not living up to the model of a 'perfect' Muslim - after all only Allah has the power to turn our hearts and make obedience to Him easier on us, so asking Him for help with this can be calming because it's the main thing that'll yield results. 

The other thing I'd say is that some people, although they mean well, can affect your iman negatively. I think you should distance yourself from the friend that is making you feel anxious and putting you off hijab, and try and find a more supportive circle of Muslim friends.

628,"&gt;when we're seen as inferior for being women. I've seen and heard it too much in our communities. 

Related to this, I read [this article](http://aljumuah.com/and-the-male-is-not-like-the-female-is-one-gender-preferred-over-another-in-islam/) recently and practically wanted to applaud: 

&gt;In truth, the Divine words And the male is not like the female is meant to emphasize that the differences between male and female should not be viewed as some kind of validation for the marginalization of women, but to celebrate the fact that men and women alike were created uniquely. There are indeed many commonalities between the genders, but there is also difference – and these differences are to be appreciated, not mocked. These differences are meant to be used in tandem with each other so that the genders can complement each other and support each other to build a beautiful, holistic environment wherein everyone benefits – not just one group... From Hinna bint Fâqûdh, we know that the male is not like the female; from Maryam we know that the female is capable of so much more than we choose to acknowledge.

However, I think it's all well and good that Muslim women are writing and sharing things like this, but just like the article I posted, does it actually get through to the people who need to hear it most? The problematic attitudes we see are cultural and deeply ingrained, they're going to take time and education to change. But the type of men who hold these views strongly (that women are inferior and deserving of poor treatment) are by definition the least likely to listen to women pointing out the problem, whether we do it in a shrill shriek or a balanced, academic way. I would love to see more of the ~~silent~~ majority ~~(I hope)~~ of decent Muslim men who don't hold these views, holding to account the people that do.

641,"I can't actually find the statistic you quoted anywhere in the document you linked. Google gave me a Quilliam Foundation (yeah, I know) report which said: 

&gt;Quilliam conducted a poll in September 2008 of over 500 mosques in Britain, which posed five questions on women’s facilities, language, evening classes for children and where the imam(s) were from and where they trained, which gives some indication of the depth of the problem. The survey found that out of 254 mosques, 97 per cent of imams came from outside of Britain, and out of 152 mosques, 92 per cent trained abroad. The religious leadership in the vast majority of Britain’s mosques, therefore, are not in full command of the English language, and are likely to be ill-equipped to address the real concerns and everyday experiences of young British Muslims. Their
overseas upbringing and training does not prepare them to help young British Muslims integrate into a democratic, multi-faith society, of which they have a limited understanding, and leaves them powerless to challenge Islamist extremist rhetoric propagated by young, English-speaking, and articulate Muslims. The survey also found that out of 494 mosques, 44 per cent do not include English in
any aspect of their Friday sermons and out of 501 mosques only 54 per cent say they have facilities for women. This current disconnect between young, English-speaking Muslim men and women who hold their faith to be of fundamental importance, and their insular, elder, family members who retain control of most mosques, has led to young Muslims turning to other outlets for their religion-based worldview. University Islamic societies, Muslim satellite channels, annual summer camps, conferences, exhibitions, internet chat forums, and membership-based voluntary organizations have all become viable, alternative social spaces for young, engaged Muslims.

I've not heard of the Sheikhs you mentioned but I know many who are homegrown and educated, they just don't hold positions in mosques or have much sway in the community. These positions still tend to be held by older men from 'back home'. 

&gt;Mosque are just places of worship.

Well, no. In majority non-Muslim countries, mosques *can* just be places of worship, but ideally are places that bring the community together and act as a hub for activities and events.

Also, with all due respect, you've mentioned in your other comment that you're from India. In that case you might not have seen first hand that although it takes years of study, Islamic scholarship isn't something Muslim parents in the UK generally encourage their sons to pursue full time.

That's actually something I realised about myself recently since a previous discussion similar to this one on this sub. I think there are valid reasons for why it happens but honestly putting myself in my brothers' shoes has shown me that I'd find it incredibly frustrating so I'm trying to correct that bias in myself at least.

However, to go back to the original point - I think Muslim men and women tend to get defensive when the opposite gender points out flaws and generalises. I've seen plenty of articles where Muslim women are advised on their shortcomings by other Muslim women and that's generally better received. What is needed, I think, is for more Muslim men to be more outspoken about standing up for women's rights and against misogyny, not in a defensive way or as a rebuttal to other people's arguments, but proactively (I've seen a few articles in this vein but it's not commonly discussed).

That aside - how do we go about achieving change where it does need to be made, and addressing the correct audience?

722,"Mashallah, congratulations!!

Some advice (that I'm not always great at following myself but things that help me and that would be ideal):

-avoid burnout. Don't spend every waking moment studying, have set times for work and set times for relaxation and having a life. Take care of yourself, eat well, exercise, practice positive thinking and get fresh air. And floss daily, that's important too. 

-choose your friends carefully, med school is much easier if you have supportive people around you! And it's good to have understanding people around when you need to debrief over some traumatic thing you've seen.

-if you can't bring yourself to study for hours, at least just open your books and make a couple of flash cards. Flash cards are great. Look into Anki/spaced repetition! And get some nice stationery. 

-realise that med school is just a bunch of hurdles and hoops you have to jump through to get to your end goal. Don't get too hung up on it.

-be a nice person. It makes life easier when nurses/docs/other students like you. Nobody wants to help the angry guy that complains about everything. 

-don't let it make you arrogant. There are millions of people who've made it through medical school, being a med student or a doctor isn't a massive achievement, it's a job like any other and your purpose is to serve your fellow man, not to lord it over them.

795,"&gt;In conclusion, errors in the harakāt (diacritics) will not render the salāh invalid no matter how severe the mistake. A mistake made in the letter of a word which alters the meaning to a corrupt meaning will invalidate the salāh. Faults in the recitation of the word will invalidate the salāh when the meaning of the word is totally different and the word is not found in the Qur῾ān. Similarly, the addition of a word-whether it is found in the Qur῾ān or not- will invalidate the salāh if the proposed meaning is inappropriateinappropriate. Repetition and disarray of words will only nullify the salāh if the meaning portrayed is incorrect. Verses recited disorderly without pauses in between will invalidate the salāh when two verses are at odds with each other. Besides these errors, all other others will be overlooked and the salāh will be deemed as valid. Nevertheless, if a recitation was made in such a way that it had the potential to invalidate the prayer, however the error was immediately corrected, then the salāh will remain valid.[22] 

Jazakallah khair!

848,"&gt;Having access to knowledge though makes you more aware of Islam, and what it should mean for our lives. I'm thankful to God guiding me and making truly see how beautiful this religion is and how deep it is!

Alhamdulillah :)

I've been pondering the positives and negatives of having all this information - looking at my great-grandparents and grandparents' generations, they had less ready access to knowledge, but they had a lot more faith and simplicity in their practice of Islam. Yes there was a lot of culture mixed in, and people didn't always know why things were done in particular ways, but they unquestioningly tried to seek Allah's pleasure. Whereas now we have so much information at our fingertips, we can verify things more easily, but also question things more easily. ",2016-03-10 18:43:36+00:00,d0v02r6,4.0,t1_d0ut9vy,8968.0,islam

852,"This is one of my dad's favourite topics. He's run a shop in a majority white non-Muslim town for the last 30 odd years, and is part of the little community there - he has a lot of praise for the local culture in that older people are generally self-reliant and uncomplaining, they generally have high standards when it comes to manners and what's 'proper', and they take care of one another - so if a regular hasn't been in to pick up their messages one day someone will notice and go check on them, help them out if need be. He says that the general opinion is that most of that is getting lost from the younger generation though. 

Personally, I feel that I'm more free to practise Islam in the west - I don't have to wear hijab or dress a certain way, I don't have to pray or fast, but I do it because of religion and not the prevailing culture. It's a battle, but it feels rewarding. I also think that in the west even though society is still unequal, these issues are more talked about - narrowing the gap between rich and poor, emphasis on a welfare state and universal healthcare, a push towards more ethical consumer practices. 

That said, having grown up in the west, my view of Muslim countries is probably not all that accurate. And when I spend time in Muslim countries, hearing the call to prayer 5 times a day and where practising Islam is the norm, I do feel like I'm missing out.

[This article](http://aboutislam.net/reading-islam/finding-peace/trusting-allah/leave-the-future-alone-until-it-comes/) was shared with me recently and I found it quite helpful. There's a lot to be said of having a policy of tying your camel and leaving the rest to Allah - do what you can to help your situation, and pray for the best result, having tawakkul that Allah has it all planned out. 

As for dealing with your jealousy re: your cousin getting married - first off, things are always better from the outside looking in, I'm sure she has her own worries about the future and may even look at parts of your life as being better than hers. Married women/women with kids always tell me to appreciate how much time I have and how few responsibilities - alhamdulillah being single means you're a lot freer to work on whatever projects interest you, focus on what blessings you have in life to try and generate some positivity and gratitude. 

&gt;What I am saying is, I would like some praise, a mild amount.

Well why not, praise is nice lol. One thing I've noticed about myself is, when I'm feeling negative, my speech is more negative, my attitude is more negative, and it has an impact on my encounters with others. When you feel positive you project it outwardly and get more positivity from others in return. I think it works both ways too - if you feel low but have positive chat and praise for others, it helps pick up your mood and makes you feel better about life. 

When it comes to the bridal shower - remind yourself about your cousin's good qualities and why she deserves to be happy, and make sincere dua for her. Don't make it about yourself. ",2016-02-21 19:58:19+00:00,d08ew2j,1.0,t3_46s3qw,80099.0,Hijabis

The reason why it's 'white women' is probably because white people are the majority here, white girls are more commonly vulnerable and in care, and other races are tiny minorities compared to asians. Plus Asian attitudes towards black/other races tends to be negative. Plus, asian Muslims use 'goray' to refer to non-Muslims, so when discussing non Muslim women they use 'white' as a stand in. 

I actually don't care to convince you, I just wanted to clarify my points. I'm not trying to villify my own community, I know these attitudes are not held by the majority of us, but I just want more awareness of problematic attitudes so that they can be challenged whenever they occur.

1074,"Some problems I've heard from people in joint families:

- the husband and wife struggle more to share intimate moments, desi families in general are not keen on PDAs and sometimes even prefer them to sit separately watching TV etc

- the mother in law and daughter in law tend to step on each other's toes more because they are in each other's space. MIL has more ammo to criticise her DIL because she's aware of everything she does.

- the wife might have to wear hijab constantly at home if her husbands brothers live there or visit a lot unexpectedly

- the wife is coming into someone else's home (her husband's parents) as opposed to it being neutral, so she is expected to conform to their habits and way of living, with very little compromise expected from her husband and his family. If things are tense, she doesn't have a place to feel 'at home', or to go away and be herself without being scrutinised 

- the husband's family are aware of things the couple might prefer to keep private - not just their intimacy but also if they have a minor argument, it can become a bigger deal because his whole family will pick up on it. 

- the couple are still answerable to his parents in terms of their comings and goings - they might not be able to take spontaneous outings and things that are good for their relationship, they may have to run it by the family out of courtesy 

- generally, familiarity breeds contempt. It's much easier to get on with people when you don't see them every day - when you live with people, you can get into little arguments over minor issues and the relationship deteriorates.

All of this sounds very pessimistic, I know that joint families can also work beautifully and have their own benefits , but I think it takes a lot of effort, sabr and good manners from all parties to do so.  ",2016-01-18 01:10:34+00:00,cz260hq,6.0,t1_cz1p57j,25344.0,islam

1092,"&gt;Stop thinking that once you are married, you will be happy... If one goes into marriage with that mentality, they're never going to be happy and why would they? It's such a terrible outlook. Being married is going to make one happier than when they were single. The problems don't go away, but now you have someone else to solve those problems with.

I get what you're saying, but I don't think the comment meant that 'marriage won't make you happy at all', I think they were saying that 'marriage isn't a cure-all if you're already unhappy' which is valid advice. Many people try to use relationships as a cure for their own problems - you see it a lot in the Asian community, mums say things like 'oh my son/daughter is lazy/depressed/gay/alcoholic/whatever, but they'll be fine once they get married'. 

It's also prevalent in western culture, most rom-coms show a guy or girl that's messed up on their own, but their partner comes along and fixes everything that was wrong. It means that people's expectations of relationships are sky-high, and the drop back down to reality can be massively steep. 

Obviously, relationships and marriage are a huge source of happiness - but I think that it would be a bad start to go in unhappy, with little to offer, and expect your partner to solve everything. If you're happy in yourself as a single person first, you can bring a lot more to the table and have a healthier and happier relationship inshallah. That's what it means to focus on personal development - not particularly to go skydiving or pick up extra letters after your name or whatever.",2016-01-14 09:58:34+00:00,cyxr7u9,3.0,t1_cywcq0p,99971.0,Hijabis

1148,"&gt;- How old were you?

I started wearing it regularly on my first day of high school, so 12. I used to wear it occasionally before then 'for practise'.

&gt; - Did you initially do it due to your obedience to Allah or because of pressure from your family?

Not pressure per se, but I wanted to start at the same point my older sisters started, because that's what annoying little sisters do.

&gt; - How did the Muslims/non-Muslims you already knew react to you wearing it?

I had told my friends and family so they were expecting it. One or two of my friends said things like 'oh what a shame you have to cover up now', and I used to give impassioned little pre-teen speeches about the value of hijab.

&gt; - Did you feel empowered or more self-conscious?

Empowered in a sense, because I felt like I'd gained an identity. For a long time I defined myself by my hijab, I've grown past that now and now I feel indifferent mostly.

&gt; - How long did it take you in the early days to get your headscarf on correctly before going out?

Less than a minute. I used to wear a square scarf, folded into a triangle, safety pinned under the chin with the flaps tied back. Vintage. Always black to match my school uniform.

Nowadays I wear the long rectangle ones (maxi hijabs?) and do some folds/layers, and I almost never wear black because I think it looks harsh on me. Still takes me under 2 mins though.

&gt; - What's the best way you remind yourself to be patient when the hijab gets inconvenient (e.g. too hot)?

Dunno really. I still get annoyed when it flaps in my face in the wind, or feels tight. If it's hot I loosen it off but this is not often because I live in the frigid north. I'd like to say something inspiring but at this point I'm so used to wearing it I mostly can't imagine not. ",2015-12-13 10:11:03+00:00,cxxdoc3,1.0,t3_3wi785,81771.0,Hijabis

&gt;I’m not an entrepreneur because I want to be. I’m an entrepreneur because I have to be. For us, it’s life or death. It’s survival. And that’s why we’re going to succeed: because, as costly as a startup is, we can’t afford any other option.

&gt;As the founder of MuslimGirl, I get media requests around the clock during these media frenzies to explain “the current climate for Muslim women.” This time, I’m running out of different palatable variations of saying, “Our lives are under threat right now.” 

oh come on, this is alarmist nonsense 

&gt;Countless women’s websites and news blogs this year have cashed in on almost patronizing modest fashion headlines, reducing Muslim women to their apparently shocking ability to dress well, rock a scarf, and look acceptable to the Western gaze. 

We're never going to be happy are we? Media doesn't show hijab = we're being marginalised and ignored, they only show Muslims in a bad light, etc. Media does show hijab = they're being patronising, why do they need to show that we can be normal, we're being exploited.

Also what's with 'western gaze'? I have been brought up in the west, I look at other cultures through that lens. I might not look like a stereotypical Brit but I'm not going to make it easier for society to think of me as 'other' by doing it myself first.

No, even within your first statement you say that Muslims are saying that the extremists are not Muslim ""rather than"" opposing them - you may not realise that to a Muslim, pronouncing takfir (saying a Muslim has done something that makes them not Muslim) is the most drastic statement of opposition one can make.

1156,"&gt;A majority of British Muslims writing off a small but active element inside their own religion as ""oh but they're not *real* Muslims"" rather than vigorously opposing them.

&gt;Or, the majority of British Muslims being somehow incapable of ideologically discrediting a strain of their own religion that advocates extreme violence.

I don't understand how you can make both of these arguments, when they blatantly contradict each other.

To explain: the majority of British Muslims say that the criminals are not real Muslims *in order to* vigorously oppose them and ideologically discredit them. The mainstream interpretations of the Quran and Sunnah do NOT support the murder of innocents.  In Islam there are certain acts and beliefs that remove you from the fold and literally mean that you're not a Muslim - this means that calling someone 'not a real Muslim' is not a logical fallacy, but a way of discrediting them ideologically, which is exactly what you want them to do!

The confusion arises because it's not about all of the above for every person who wears it. Everybody has their individual motivations for wearing it, for some it might be more cultural, others more religious, or a whole spectrum in between. Some people might feel that as long as all the appropriate body parts are covered they have free reign within that to cover in whatever manner they prefer, others might lean more towards covering less but deliberately not striving towards being attractive. The fact of the matter is that in almost any culture around the world, women enjoy beautifying themselves, and hijabis are in general not an exception, and I personally don't think one can say it impacts on their faith either way.",2015-11-06 17:01:07+00:00,cwqt6x4,3.0,t1_cwqiv8m,22264.0,Hijabis

You have a lot of nasty things to say about yourself don't you? I've edited your post so you can see it all together. Imagine if you were so horrible when your were talking about a friend. If every time they spoke you told them 'you look stupid, you sound stupid, why are you so weird'. They'd soon shut up and get really awkward whenever you were around. Well, that's what you are doing to yourself. 

If your internal monologue is constantly insulting to yourself, you'll end up constantly thinking negatively - and what you think is what you project to the outside world. This is at the root of a lot of social anxiety. What works is changing your internal monologue, and that's not easy to do - you've had a lot of practice thinking nasty things, changing that to positivity isn't like flipping a switch. 

I recommend looking into cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT). There is information online including [workbooks like this](http://www.comh.ca/publications/resources/asw/scdpantidepressantskills.pdf). I know you've said elsewhere that you're not mentally ill or depressed but social anxiety is a real problem and you can get help with it, therapy isn't a big deal and it would very likely help you.

If the surgeon nicked the nerve during the surgery my face would have looked like it melted. No function and it would have sagged. I'm so grateful he didn't nick the nerve.

You have a few things confused. The trigeminal nerve is a cranial nerve not a spinal one, that means it comes out of your brain, through a hole at the base of your skull, then branches off - nothing to do with your spine. Also, it only supplies feeling to your face (and movement to the muscles for chewing), so if they nicked one of the sensory branches your face wouldn't look any different, you'd have a patch that felt numb, tingly or painful. You'd still have good function - especially since you're talking about surgery on your neck where there's only a few sensory branches of the trigeminal (there's other motor nerves that pass there, like the accessory nerve that allows you to shrug your shoulders, but it's deeper). To make your face sag, your surgeon would have to damage the facial nerve, likely during surgery on a parotid salivary gland.",2015-10-01 07:37:46+00:00,cvkae94,8.0,t1_cvk4t3v,15009.0,WTF

Yes but the communities that practise consanguineous marriage tend to have done so for generations. If you go to any genetic medicine unit in the UK the majority of the patients there will be Pakistani because they tend to encourage marriage to first cousins. 

For this reason I think it's reprehensible to encourage cousins to marry (if they want to marry of their own accord, fair enough, but something major needs to change to freshen up the gene pool and make the community healthier).

1421,"&gt;I've actually thought from time to time that there should be some sort of dental care subreddit (if there isn't one already!).  I would love to see some kind of breakdown of the different types of toothpaste and whitening products from a scientific/expert perspective.  And, of course, reviews of products.

I don't think there would be enough material to warrant a whole sub tbh. What it boils down to is this:

Your toothpaste needs to have enough fluoride (1300-1500ppm). Beyond that, there's not a lot that differentiates one toothpaste from another except personal preference, eg SLS free, extra minerals for sensitivity, taste etc. Toothpastes marketed as whitening should generally be avoided as they're generally more abrasive to remove surface stains but this can thin out enamel in the long term.

Floss: personal preference. 

Toothbrush: electric is better than manual when used correctly, but there's nothing to differentiate one type of electric toothbrush from another. 

Whitening products: basically, it's all about hydrogen peroxide and its concentration. Consumer products like whitening strips aren't as effective as the % is lower because of regulations - this is the case in the UK anyway, I don't know about elsewhere. Also, if you get whitening treatment done it should be by a dentist or under their direct supervision, it's illegal for other parties like beauticians to do it. Dentists are allowed to prescribe higher %s of peroxide than can be used over the counter so in surgery treatment is more effective. 

Speaking as a dentist, that's about it. So a sub dedicated to this would get boring pretty fast! ",2015-09-06 17:40:09+00:00,cusmnm7,3.0,t1_cusfd5m,16257.0,AsianBeauty

1488,"Honestly, although you've done a great job with your pictures and notes, no dentist no matter how good, could answer all your questions without seeing you in person and getting some X-rays. But here's some thoughts:

Basically, I want to improve my confidence and the main questions are:

&gt; Is it worth removing that snaggle tooth?

You'd get a better looking result by making some space (either by removing teeth further back or making the front teeth thinner) and putting the 'snaggle' tooth back in alignment. You'd need to see an orthodontist though to see what options are actually available to you. 


&gt;Is it worth/possible to get the fillings I have changed for white ones (Roughly how much would that cost too?)

It's possible but not worth it unless the silver fillings actually need replacing, because removing the old fillings will damage some of the healthy tooth structure unnecessarily. 

&gt;Is there anything I can get done for the front central incisors?

Those are your central incisors. You need to identify what the cause of the wear is, and treat that first - you can get a mouth guard made if you're grinding, or cut down on acid in your diet (especially juices) if you have erosion. In fact, if you grind your teeth that's probably contributing to your jaw pain - look up TMD (temporomandibular joint disorder).

&gt; Is it possible to get them whitened even though I have some sensitive spots already?

No point, til you've sorted all the other issues. And you will make your teeth more sensitive regardless.

Personally I'm using face sunscreen to help fade my PIH and because I use AHA/BHA daily, otherwise it wouldn't really factor(!) into my routine. ",2015-07-20 00:58:36+00:00,ct96pux,4.0,t1_ct95m0w,2042.0,SkincareAddiction

I think I'm a Fitzpatrick V (skin is NC45-ish, I can get a tan but I've never been sunburnt), but I live at a high latitude and there's not much sunlight to be had - even the indigent white population has high rates of vitamin D deficiency. I get little sun exposure because of my dark colouring, and because as a Muslim woman I don't expose a lot of skin when I'm outdoors. 

I've been vitamin D deficient and symptomatic with it for years, and supplementation isn't very effective. For these reasons the only sunscreen I wear is on my face - and whenever the sun is shining, I go outside and try and catch some rays on my arms and legs. I'm not concerned about skin cancer at all really, the risk is small, and if I do get it it's unlikely to be related to sun exposure.

1559,"&gt;he's specifically said they'll be paid a premium and more will be trained.


Did he really say either of these things? I thought he wanted an end to unsocial hours payments and for weekends to be considered the same as other weekdays. He's also painted consultants as the privileged elite who get to decide whether to work weekends as opposed to staff further down the chain who don't have that choice. In reality, by the time a doctor has reached consultant level, they'll have regularly sacrificed weekends, nights, and much of their family/social time - only to commit to more on call weekends and nights. 

When it comes to training, I'm also sceptical - the new GPs he promised have turned out to be a proposal for people only 2 years out of medical school practicing as specialty doctors, without the extra 3 years of training GPs do. The shape of training review also means that consultant training takes less time, meaning consultants have less experience (so that junior consultants will exist and can get paid less).",2015-07-19 12:22:56+00:00,ct8kiqj,3.0,t1_ct8gx14,16061.0,unitedkingdom

It really depends on the specific procedure how long it takes to look 'normal'. I've seen people who have had similar operations for mouth cancer - they'll be in hospital for a few weeks, usually fed through a tube in their nose. 

After about 3 months or so the swelling might be completely gone, but they may still look abnormal due to issues with nerves healing giving them a droopy lip, or scarring making the reconstructed area pull the healthy skin, or the thickness of the grafted skin/bone causing them to still look swollen. With grafted skin, it's not identical in colour or texture to facial skin, so it usually looks quite obvious. 

They may then get revision surgery for any of these issues 6months later at the earliest. But some people never look 'normal' afterwards.

For everything else - just imagine you're having a conversation with a friend or family member, not a patient.

If you're specifically meaning hijab, you might have to double check they have removed all pins/safety pins - some people use a lot, or keep spares in their clothing. Don't make any comment on their hair, how long it is, how it's so lovely and it's such a shame they have to cover. Use normal language to describe their clothing: headscarf, hijab or veil is ok, headdress sounds weird, burka is usually used incorrectly and in a derogatory way. And give them extra time (preferably with access to a mirror!) to get dressed afterward.

All of these things might sound ridiculously common sense, but they're all things that I have encountered as a hijab wearing woman!

Absolutely, I also assumed this was the case.

I can admire both these women for their religious devotion but I still don't think I have to find them physically beautiful. 

Also, when it comes to the idea of minimising the importance of beauty, I think if we label everything and anything as beautiful, we'll end up in a strange situation - a bit like in that Vonnegut story Harrison Bergeron, where everybody's talents have to be limited to the average, so that no one has an unfair advantage. Yes, beauty is subjective, but traits that are associated with physical beauty are usually consistent and associated with health and youth, so if someone is obviously physically beautiful, it's ok - let's praise other people for other things as well.
