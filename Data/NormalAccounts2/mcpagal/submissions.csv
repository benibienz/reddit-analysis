Basically, I feel like the trend of hijabi bloggers/youtubers/instagrammers is potentially detrimental to young women - there are these gorgeous supermodel looking girls, rocking hijab and looking amazing - but they don't seem to offer much more than that, there's no message behind it, they generally don't talk about their achievements or values or anything like that, it's just about looking fashionable and photos with their mouths hanging half open, and drinking whatever laxative tea that sponsors them (that last bit was mean, I might edit that). These images are carefully selected, filtered and posted to give an impression of a certain kind of lifestyle and person - possibly one that's unachievable.

I think if their followers have a strong sense of self then they can take it at face value - get some fashion inspiration and shopping advice, and not let it otherwise affect them. But women in general are prone to low self esteem, depression, anxiety and eating disorders - and I think this type of media feeds into people's insecurities and can be harmful. I was at a lecture by a psychiatrist specialising in eating disorders recently, and she said that in treatment centres, magazines and the internet are banned, because of the unwritten (and sometimes written) harmful messages.  

There's another side to it too - muslim men also consume these images, and can have unrealistic expectations of women based on them, the same way looking at photoshopped magazine images of celebrities would give anyone unrealistic expectations of the human body. Sometimes they leave comments underneath like 'bro this is the one I was telling you about, wife material, she's so mash'allah' etc... It's just gross. 


I don't know where I'm going with this really - it's not like I want to tell other women what to do, or to not post content online when that's what they enjoy, or not to engage with it when the majority of people are capable of enjoying it casually and not coming to any harm. It's just a train of thought and I'd like to know what others think too. ",Hijabis,Instagram Hijabis vs Self Esteem,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hijabis/comments/47jynm/instagram_hijabis_vs_self_esteem/

I've come a long way and although I feel a bit self conscious sharing my pictures I hope they can help someone! 

So here goes. 

[This](http://i.imgur.com/k2lnhBK.jpg) was the first picture of my skin I posted here (under a throwaway I don't remember any more). I was concerned about the whiteheads I was getting on my forehead, chin, jaw, and cheeks, and the PIH they were leaving behind. Up until I posted I'd been trying different routines I'd had recommended - Clearasil, The Body Shop tea tree line, and the standard Clinique 3-step programme (including a dark-spot corrector that had done absolutely nothing for me except empty my wallet of 60 odd pounds). 

After I posted this picture, I started a gentler routine - Paula's choice Clear cleanser, toner, moisturiser and sunscreen (introducing these things slowly, like I'd been told), washing my headscarves daily, and my pillowcases weekly. I also became obsessive about not keeping my face towel in the bathroom, and changing it daily too. 

Overall, it didn't really help.

[This](http://i.imgur.com/wy53xUD.jpg) was my skin around 6 months later. I actually think that the skin around the PIH/acne was improved, my forehead in particular is much less dull. But the acne was now definitely cystic, constantly sore, and making me miserable. It was pointed out to me (by the lovely ieatbugs if I recall correctly) that I wasn't using any particular anti-acne products, and I got recommendations to start using BHA and benzoyl peroxide (which is a real arse to try and track down in the UK). 

I also got a lot of PMs pointing out to me how hairy my face was and giving me product/treatment recommendations for hair removal. I don't know why I'd never noticed it before. A few people suggested that I might have PCOS or some other condition that was making me excessively hirsute, but nope, I'm just one of those lucky Asian girls that gets to be hairy. Great for eyelashes, terrible for sideburns. Oh well. I got myself a [facial hair trimmer](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Philips-HP6390-10-Precision-Trimmer/dp/B00BN2CJDA) - in hot pink so I could feel feminine while shaving my hairy face - but I had to wait months until the acne calmed down enough to let me start using it. 

[6 months or so later](http://i.imgur.com/kgGUKDF.jpg). I was so much happier! The BP and BHA definitely helped flatten out the cysts, I was in less pain, and my face was smooth enough that I could shave to my heart's content. I was still dealing with PIH/PIE and the odd new cyst, usually monthly and usually on my cheek/jawline. This was when I decided to see my GP - they agreed that my acne was probably hormonal, and prescribed me Co-Cyprindiol (Dianette). 

I continued this routine for another 12-18 months, and got to [here](http://i.imgur.com/mvRefzs.jpg). BOOM. So happy. My skin was so much better, I got compliments all the time, people said I looked radiant, the lady in Philosophy asked me what my routine was so she could recommend it to others. NO MORE ACNE FO LIFE BIATCHES. 

Orrrr... maybe not. Shortly after the last picture I moved, started studying for a new degree, and noticed small breakouts (usually closed comedones) starting on my forehead. Occasionally cysts and whiteheads too. [6 months after the last picture](http://i.imgur.com/9w7qEFO.jpg) I realised it had gotten pretty bad and went back to the GP. This time I was prescribed a topical antibiotic (Zineryt = zinc and erythromycin). 

[It worked! Yay!](http://i.imgur.com/3zk4ojf.jpg) This was my face last week. The redness isn't usually there, I was immediately post-shave in this picture. I'm still dealing with some stubborn PIH, but I'm back to getting compliments and feeling happy with my skin!

**My Current Routine**
I've mentioned a few things I've tried in the past in the wall of text above, but this is what's working for me now:

*Morning:*

Wash face with water &amp; konjac sponge
Zineryt
BHA (Paula's Choice 2% gel)
Sunscreen (Eucerin Adjunctive Hydrating Care - SPF30, and it's moisturising enough that I don't need a separate moisturiser. It's a bit greasy but I love it otherwise!)

*Evening*

If no makeup: Cetaphil Gentle Skin cleanser
If makeup: remove with Johnson's baby oil, then cleanse. I don't really have a preference, I've liked Shiseido White Lucency Cleansing Foam and Origins Never a Dull Moment, right now I'm using Tony Moly Intense Care Snail Foam Cleanser. 
Zineryt
BHA
AHA (Paula's Choice 8% Glycolic Acid Gel)
Vitamin C (John Masters Organics Vitamin C Serum)
Moisturiser (Eucerin Replenishing Face Cream with 5% Urea - again, it's thick and greasy but I wake up in the morning with my face feeling soft and hydrated so it's alright Eucerin, we're good for now)

*Occasional* 

These are things I intend to do weekly, and probably did at some point, but now I just do them whenever I have some spare time or I'm procrastinating. Like right now. I have an essay to write but I'm typing a long-ass post about my face instead. Don't judge me, you'd do the same thing. 

Origins Clear Improvement Active Charcoal Mask - I love this for really clearing out my pores and making my skin feel super clean.

Philosophy Microdelivery Vitamin C/Peptide Peel - this is amazing for PIH, I see a visible improvement after I've used it. From experience though I'd say never ever use it if you have active acne/open comedones/any irritation because it makes it worse, and don't follow the advice of gently rubbing the crystals on your face because it's stupidly sore and just causes irritation.

Rice flour mask - I make this at home, mixture of rice flour, milk, honey and almond oil. It's lovely, reduces redness and PIH, but I don't do it as often as I should because it's effort. 

**Conclusion**
So there you go! If you've got this far, well done. I'm really happy with my SCA experience, I remember lurking at first and being confused about the jargon, and about how anyone can spend so much time looking after their skin, but here I am now!

I'm planning to see a dermatologist in the near future to find out about options for the hyperpigmentation around my mouth and eyes - any advice would be appreciated!

Also, if you're still reading - based on the photos, what do you think my skin undertones are? I go for yellow based foundations (NC44 in MAC) but I'm never 100% happy that I've got a good match. 

Have a great day!
