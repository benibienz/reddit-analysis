Trevor is her love and that love pushes her and so does the temptation to help those outside of Thermiscira. The whole thing about the sides , I think is a moot point currently.

When the news came of Denis making it, all my worries went out the window. Prisoners sold me on him in 2013 because whenever I think of that movie, I think of dark rain. The movie has such an atmosphere and it showed so much that I hadn't seen in that genre. Denis can make an environment for a blade runner sequel. Yeah the movie will be different than the first in some ways, but it won't be in a degrative way.

Loki was decent villain who was kinda used to get to a big fight with the aliens . The third act fight doesn't have to be about all that jazz but it was needed for this film. Loki was essentially used like a plot device to show that the Avengers and the avengers . Hawkeye was pretty sidelined for whatever reason and he was shooting what felt like unlimited arrows . Besides all third act issue jazz . It's good stuff that's just putting this team together. The movies other name Avengers Assemble described the movie accurately . I didn't like that the starts pretty great , we have our team assemble and the ultimately the stakes aren't really there . The most you feel is maybe with Tony almost dying . The whole thing about Banner being angry the entire time , was a cool line but made no sense to me . The thing with Stark was also that he never really showed that he was affected by whole falling from space thing . They make a big deal of it in Iron Man 3. The movie ultimately is a solid 8/10. It lacks true feeling besides the cool sugar that you want in a big movie like that . You don't get to see the team as a team till the end , so it kinda sucks . What we get a lot of in Avengers 2 is the team working together on screen and it's a lot of fun

For me it was all about them just getting the team together and then fighting a bunch of aliens in the third act. I didn't really like that. I prefer when we have these fantastic characters and they're going through some shit. Thats why I like Avengers 2 more. Yes Avengers 2 has issues, but everyone for the most part is really going through some issue. I compare Avengers to The Dark Knight. The Dark Knight rose above just being a movie for me and for many others. So much influence comes from TDK since it's release. Avengers is just there. It's not really doing anything new besides bringing together a team and throw in some great snappy dialogue from Joss. Compared to the best movies from the MCU, it just doesn't hold much for me.

290,The show everyone should be watching is 'Atlanta' . It just finished its season one run on Tuesday . I have a very strong feeling people will be finding the show in this next year or so before season 2. Arguablely some of the best comedy work in a while and the most relevant for our time . Fantastically shot comedy show that's probably the best looking comedy show that highlights a city you don't see much on TV. Donald Glover and company created this show and it is a total passion project that leaks on to the screen. He described it as Twin Peaks but with Rappers. That's what it is . BUT they have actual people rather than stereotypes and they tackle some very real things in the show . They do some bold things that just take the show another step higher . Check out the show if you already haven't . You won't regret it . ,2016-11-03 12:18:51+00:00,d9jufff,1.0,t3_5auy6g,26055.0,flicks

Saw the film on Sunday night and Damien Chazelle did a Q and A afterwards. The movie was fantastic and cannot wait to enjoy it even more in theaters in December.

Directing eps on JJ can come to be a big deal if they do a great job. Considering the majority of stories told have been by white men, there is a need for diversity in storytellers. In Cooglers case they were black directors specifically but they found a BP fan. Its an opportunity for a black director to become the highest grossing black director of all time. Coogler is going to do that. He should have already had that happen with Creed. Creed deserved a larger audience but thats besides the point. In this period of time where diversity is becoming a thing, they are going into different crowds to find filmmakers. If you want someone to do a movie, studios have relations with directors or with certain agents who predominantly have male white people. Every person getting a job because of diversity is a good thing. Some of these people have been hustling a long time or no one is giving them a chance. Aziz Ansari and Alan Yang wrote their show and went to Netflix. They used the power acquire after almost a decade of work to finally have the most openly creative network give them a chance.

I would say that the only thing that bugged me was that there could have been a few more moments where things took more time . BUT that's not the type of movie it was. It feels so weird with these new three films because I can't fully judge them till I see the other two . I undoubtedly will enjoy Ep8 more than 7. I fell in love with Rians work back in 2011 when I saw Brick and then Looper in 2012 and Ozymandias ep from BB in 2013. It was just perfect that he got ep 8.

This is one film where you CANT have inspire or flashy cinematography. It is a very terrible subject matter and it doesn't need visual flourishments that I enjoy too. But with that said this was a very intentional choice on their part. The shot of the one guy from the spotlight team going outside of his house and walking down the street to see how close those pedophiles lived was a continuous shot that just felt to real to me. Oddly enough I live right across from a sex offender and its crazy.  The movie deserves the accolades it got because it does shine a light on a fucked up situation. one line that stays with me is ""how do you say no to god"". I live in Georgia and my guidance counselor from high school came out a few months ago and confessed that he was scared by his childhood in Boston and had a priest kiss on him and he was almost raped till a phone call stopped it all.

He's making an adaption for Murder on The Orient Express last time I checked. Its just personal preference.

I believe that a good composer for the most part adapts his music to the project like a DP does with his/her imagery/shooting style. Desplat and Giachinno are both good at it but I've felt more emotion from Desplat honestly. His piece 'Lilys Theme' from Harry Potter 7 Part 2 was one of the only times where I had to go and find the music after the movie because I literally got chills hearing it.,2016-09-16 00:00:12+00:00,d7ok7h7,2.0,t1_d7ojsec,641.0,movies

The premise of a movie can always be you're characters not being themselves and they spend the movie trying to get back to themselves . At the end Batman is back to himself and he's the guy who's just a living version of the batman I dreamed of as a kid.

They said they transitioned their tone from what they had in Cap 2 to what they'll be using for the Avenger films. I personally enjoyed the movie more than I expected to on the repeated viewing.

Back to the Future is a great name too because thats what the protagonist is doing in the movie. The easy way to have a bad name for a movie is maybe changing it too much. Edge of Tomorrow is a good name for a movie but the I liked the name of the comic they had as first, All You Need is Kill. ",2016-09-03 22:29:52+00:00,d78h8l8,1.0,t3_50zzvh,15565.0,flicks

Its stupid on thier part and they know they've fucked up because they've been shifting things around and getting to a hopefully better place. I'm pretty sure everyone who saw The Dark Knight Rises went and saw BvS. TDKR would have been a bigger movie but still made a great amount of money for a longer length movie. Warner Bros stupidity suprises me. I'm hoping that this wont be the issue with JL. Snyder is the guy we have whether people like it or not and he just needs to have a coherent and decently fun movie thats hopefully in not longer than 2hr20min.

Alton never showed them where he was from. I think that showing the place at the end of the film is the ultimate visual payoff for the film. We are built up to seeing where this kid belongs at the end and thats what we get. Whatever Alton showed everyone was left up to us because we hear the few different experiences people have with him and the other one that stuck was when the girl said that it was just peace that Alton brought to her. At the end of the day it was about what a father(and mother) would sacrifice for their child. We definetly didn't see what Alton showed everyone. That would have been a cheap and easy way out.

Spotlight has the moving pieces that look good together but you just don't notice those great pieces unless you look deeper.

Taraji went off the Empire where everyone sees her talent and loves her there as Cookie and that's all great but no credit for this great show that dared to go and out do something different.

I understand why some people would see the issue of the the climax peaking the film but I would actually quite a bit more intrigues in later part of the film. I'm a big spy movie person and the movie gets into that with some more intimate fights and scenes in that part of the film and I saw it as a strength rather than a weakness. The movie was a good mix of MI 1 and 4 and that's why this movie succeeded in my head. Love this movie and the craftsmanship from McQ and Tom was great in this movie .

I really loved the patient camera. There is only a few if not one fast pans in the entire film. Eggers really set the mood and kept it tense. I always like to see boldness in filmmaking. Having a horror film set in this time period was a great idea and counts as bold in my book. We don't really see many films from this time period that are like this , in terms of genre at least. The message of the film does feel muddled but I took the film just to narrative value rather than Eggers critique of the Puritan culture. The big thing if he were to critique the Puritans was their belief in Witchcraft and where it led them. The mother ends up almost killing the daughter from her thinking that the daughter was the Witch. This is a odd side note , but I was creeped out by the devil . When that fucking thing started speaking , my and my friend lost our shit. All in All, not my cup of tea but I enjoyed it more than I enjoy most films.

Others have them just to draw you in. Spielbergs Oners are so great because he makes them his own and has fun with them. Aziz Ansaris show Master of None uses them in certain conversations. Spectre used it as it's opening because it brings you in and takes you into the situation we are finding bond in. Yes it could be gimmaky but if done correctly it fucking kills. These longer takes brings realism to scenes beyond anything else. In Creed ,in rewatches, I see those longer takes that are just there because it feels organic. The Second fight in Creed in the one take killed me . It goes in the top moments of any film I saw in theaters in 2015 because you just feel the fight leap off the film. It shoudn't been an elite thing, it's about using what you have correctly. Each shot , each visual should have a goal (it's not always like this sadly) and longer takes can do this in a cooler way.

So Monday I might be doing a scene from Movie Four, and Tuesday I’m doing a scene from Movie One. … We’re working across, essentially, eight hours of story. It’s going to be a big challenge to keep it all fixed in our minds, exactly where we are, across that story arc at any given point. It’s going to be probably the most challenging thing I’ve ever done. I’m sure the actors will be challenged by that as well. It’s like, ‘No, no, no, no, this person hasn’t died yet, so you’re still in this phase of your life.’ It’s a saga. It’s like doing all three GODFATHER films at the same time.”

He brought transparency and people can call him a hero or a traitor for doing that. We could honestly argue all day about if he's good or bad for what he did. Something I can say for sure that he did mess up with was giving the info to certain journalists who didnt blackout certain names or locations of information that comprised counter terrorism operations.

There are plenty twists on his work and his work influences relations in movies without people recognizing it. There are other movies that just have everything you're looking for. At USC film school(I'm pretty this is the right one) ,they use the script for Back To the Future in their curriculum because its just such a great story. You got the drama. action, adventure, science fiction, and great comedy. Visuals in movies can make a movie timeless too without a doubt. Mad Max is the closest thing we have to a silent film today.

EDIT: also this The film was shot like ordinary live action. There were no special effects, greenscreen, or tracking markers used during filming. All effects were done in post-production. To create Ava's robotic features, they filmed the scenes both with and without actress Alicia Vikander's presence, which allowed them to capture the background behind her. The parts they wanted to keep, especially her hands and face, were then rotoscoped while the rest was digitally painted out and the background behind her restored. Camera- and body-tracking systems transferred Vikander's performance to the CGI robot's movements. In total, there were about 800 VFX shots, of which 350 or so were robot shots.[10][11]

A narrative told about a innocent boy. Cary did some amazing work and everyone is all buzzing about The Revenant but DONT SEE BEASTS. Beasts was just as good if not better than The Revenant.

It's very true that Coppala hasn't reached the height of his work that he has done before BUT he has left some amazing cinema behind that will be cherished more than most directors can ever dream.

Mad max fury road  can resonate across the board internationally because it's a film you don't really need subtitles for but some will argue it's not for kids. J world is a decent film that is not a better film because of the audience. It had an audience primarily because of Jurrasic Park first film . They way I first explained it makes it sound like Clone Wars is a great film but it was living off of New Hope , Empire and Return.

It’s a far more international story, we’re going to some incredible places, and we have a villain to rival Samuel L. Jackson—this new one is so brilliantly written I wish I could play it. It’s amazing.”

I see a director as being a person who is crafting an image to be their vision. I admire Fincher for being meticulous about crafting this image.

The way I describe it is that it feels like I have Fincher sitting behind me whispering things into my ear while I watch the movie. I really like from him. I totally understand where your coming from about the tension of the film. The narrative is where that lack comes from, they made a film that wasn't suppose to be a thriller. I personally wanted a thrilling ending where we could see our main character/characters are caught in the crosshairs of the killer. A culmination of the cat and mouse of the entire movie, but the narrative just mellows out at the end with what actually happened.

5199,Its true that we can't get something truly original but we can get something takes a bunch of great things and puts them together. I think a good example is Whiplash(2014). The director talked about how he and his editor had Raging Bull on a loop while editing the movie. He admitted that he took pages straight from Marty's book to use in his own book. He used greatness to make a great film. It might be derivative but it totally forgivable when you great an amazing piece of work. ,2015-10-06 20:33:06+00:00,cvqi704,3.0,t1_cvpyt50,32967.0,movies
5200,"THANK YOU. I heard the rumor about Nolan directing an adaption to Akira and it sounded like a terrible idea. I think there are some films that should be adapted or remade into something else but AKIRA IS NOT ONE OF THEM. I totally understand what you mean about the anime being the artful tangibility of the film that wouldnt translate into live action. Its like Iron Giant. It's a film that could have been made in style of animation that Toy Story and Bug's Life were made in at that time, but Brad Bird chose the 2D animation. It just felt right for the story and it personally is gives that feeling that you can't transfer to live action or to another version of art.

5744,"I'm gonna answer all of you questions without looking at the other answers. 

The park is expensive interms of food and drinks(Like $3 for water ). I go there every few months. I usually go to the Panda Express or Moes outside of the two parks in City Walk for lunch. Me and my brother usually keep a bag with water and gatorade. If you don't want to keep a bag, you can bring a refillable water bottle. They have those 100 flavor coke machines that give you water and ice for free. For the Harry Potter , there is a train that goes from Hogsmeade to London and vice versa. The story in the train is different for both ways , so plan to ride it boths ways. Big two attractions are The Forbidden Journey and The Escape from Gringotts and both can have long lines. The Olivanders wand experience is cool too. They have it both in Diagon Alley and in Hogsmeade. For the wand , check out universal studio's website, they sell all the same merchandise for the most part on the website too. The Dragon Challenge ride has metal detectors, so you cannot bring anything on that ride. You can keep your phone for both Forbidden Journey and Escape from Gingrotts, but in Forbidden Journey you can put your phone in a cubbie . I'm putting a link to a photo below and it shows the cubbie, its in the lower back/butt region but it will be dark and you have to sit down pretty quick. Protip for the lockers that they have around the park. They are free while you ride and it tells you how long you have for them being free. People freak out alot about remembering their locker numbers. The trick is that you just have to press the button that says forgot locker number. It lets you put in your fingerprint and it opens up your locker. No need to remember locker numbers, but you have to remember the station(1,2,3,4,etc) where you put your stuff.
If you have any questions about Orlando or about the parks, even if its not HP related, comment and I usually respond pretty quick on my mobile . Also download the universal studios app. The app lets you see the wait times for all the rides in the park. Also free wifi in the parks for the most park, they have small areas without it.

I think the movie excels at achieving everything it sets out to achieve, while being a very particular and personal vision. For that alone, it is an amazing success.
Personally I found the movie engaging visually and thematically, imaginative in its action set pieces, and lead by clearly defined and well rounded (and acted) characters. I enjoyed every single minute of it in a movie theater.
I just think that ""best movie"" is such a childish label to apply to art or media. People enjoy movies for different reasons, some people really appreciate the hard work and creativity of a practical effects horror movie, other people prefer meditative introspections of human nature. There are somewhat standards for technical achievements in the execution of a film, but what are the objective requirements for a movie to be ""the best""? It's just a ridiculous label.
Personally, my ""best movie of all time"" changes constantly. I think ""the best"" is an insecure externalization of love, as in appreciation, for a movie. For whatever reason, people can love a movie, and to them it's now the best movie ever. No need to pimp out love as a quick fix for a sudden need for external validation.
I loved Fury Road. If some people don't that's also fine, because it's not about who's right or wrong.

""He says that on the Saturday before he was scheduled to start, he felt worn down. By Sunday, he was so exhausted he stayed in bed, and a doctor diagnosed him with stage-two malaria. “It’s like someone gave you a sleeping pill, along with a pounding headache and a hot-and-cold fever,” Fukunaga says. “My entire body ached. My kidneys were aching.” The production had to push back a week as the director recovered.

But getting malaria was only the first in a series of disasters for “Beasts.” The camera operator pulled his hamstring on the first day, which meant Fukunaga had to fill in on that job, in addition to his roles as director and cinematographer, using a Steadicam strapped to his back. Some of the extras playing the tribal guards were jailed in the Ivory Coast on suspicion of being mercenaries, and had to be sent money for food and clothes. Actors wouldn’t show up for work because they lost interest, forcing Fukunaga to crank out morning rewrites. The cast was terrified of poisonous snakes, and the director — who travelled through the jungle with a machete and a stick — nearly stepped on a black mamba that could have killed him.""",2015-09-02 03:49:55+00:00,cunsvl4,1.0,t3_3jb26d,2815.0,movies

Both great films on the opposite ends of the spectrum of human emotion. I think there were alot of cringe moments in the film.

Alot of people didn't like it much but I really like it for the stylized approach and that is was a drama/mystery kinda movie with a little action here and there ",2015-08-01 04:17:43+00:00,ctnmqgh,4.0,t1_ctnm8rl,1155.0,movies

If it was that the movie was turning to shit and he left , I will be disappointed but I feel like Simon kinberg and maybe the other producers could get the film back on track",2015-08-01 01:50:48+00:00,ctnikzv,1.0,t3_3fd2up,318.0,movies

He stepped up his game after 2005 in 2010 with the amazing Social Network and he keeps going up. 2005 is where I see his change because he started filming in Digital.
