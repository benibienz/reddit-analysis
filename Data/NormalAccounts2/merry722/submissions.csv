This show gives us so much as a viewer to look at and feel. When I feel this weird feeling thats confusion but it's something more that just has to be processed , that right there is something special. It feels so weird to say that this was a finale. It wasn't a finality in any way but that's something that I shouldn't expect from show that does everything differently.

He called out 'Twin Peaks' for being that one show growing up where it wasn't the same every week. I feel like Sam has emulated that into Mr. Robot. Not trying to offend by saying this, but anyone who gets that , gets his art. I see Mr. Robot as a piece of art , like I see most great shows. If you believe in the artist, then you should like what you're getting. We are getting something great that it sucks that people just don't realize that we are getting it. It's sad that some people have stopped watching because the show is as great as it has ever been. 

TL;DR - Sam likes Twin Peaks and it can be seen in Mr. Robot in a good way

I know there have been issues between the director and 20th Century Fox and that might factor into the faith that the company has in the film.
