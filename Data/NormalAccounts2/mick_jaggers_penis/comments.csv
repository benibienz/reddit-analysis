3,"Yeah they at least tried to go a bit outside the box, they get credit for that for sure. I just think ultimately the lack of color and basically leaving half of the canvas of the jersey untouched just left them too flat and unbalanced.

I'm not really crazy about a lot of these new minimalist designs that are popping up all over the place either. I think some of these designers need to take a step back and look at some of the jerseys from the 80s and 90s. Say what you will about some of the more outlandish ones, but I really dig the way they used to utilize details in the trim of the arm and neck holes, stuff in the shading/layering of the letters/numbers, cool looking fonts etc.. the small stuff. 

A ton of teams don't even have arm/neck trim anymore (which leads to looking super flat and one dimensional) and a majority of jersey outside of the classics have move away from the crew neck style to those weird scooped V neck type things like the warriors and lakers have now.

They would have looked 1000x better with a little splash of orange on the trim or the shading of the numbers or something.

I think people also tended to overstate their greatness due to the fact that they were by far OKCs best jersey since their everyday unis are so terrible. Like I would always see something along the lines of 

""OKC has the worst jerseys in the league""

""yeah but their alternates are SO FUCKIN DOPE DUDE! Best jerseys ever!""

The point I was making is that once the string extends further than a few inches away from the headstock, I dont really see how it would be possible for the tip of the string to penetrate anything since even the smallest amount of pressure applied to the tip of the string would just result in the sting recoiling/flopping out of the way. Short string stubs are sharp as fuck, yes, but once they get longer than say, finger length, they will just bend harmlessly out of the way.

21,"I dont think it is false.

All of the guys named in this post have great name recognition due to being high profile in college and subsequently high lottery picks as professionals, but as far as their actual nba careers are concerned, outside of the vets like JJ Kyrie and Deng, none of them have really contributed to or accomplished anything in the NBA. 

As the guy above pointed out they are mostly young guys with great upside that you'd like to have on your team, and will most likely be successful in the coming years, but *right now* most of those players are not close to being fully developed and that team would not be great. If the bench players went off and overachieved, I could see them squeaking out a 7-9th place finish depending on how strong the rest of the conference is. Otherwise they're probably bottom 11th seed or lower.

A g5 team needs to have a *phenomenal* year, like undefeated and winning every game by 45 to be able to compensate for other variables (mainly strength of schedule) that put them at a disadvantage compared to p5 teams. And I don't think there is necessarily a team like that every year.

60,"[12 team h2h] I just picked up delly a couple days ago but I was looking at his numbers last night and now I kinda want to pick up Sergio. I'm getting absolutely killed in assists and I wonder if he'd be worth dropping Jonathan Simmons (who has fallen back to earth since the opener) or Ingram (who doesnt seem to be getting enough minutes to make much of an impact, but seems like maybe its too early to give up on him)?

Original ramblings:

I have Rudy Gay as my starting SF right now (12 man league/9 cat) until Hayward returns from injury and I could be way of base here but just going off of my gut feeling, I feel like he is kinda overlooked/slightly looked down on by a lot of basketball fans and as a result he probably wouldn't command very good value even though he has been putting up really good numbers. 

Through 4 games he's posted:

22/3/5

28/5/2

17/7/2

22/3/2

along with 6 blocks and 6 steals.

I'm honestly pleasantly surprised by the production I'm getting out of him and I feel like he would probably be getting a lot more hype if he wasn't Rudy Gay. But then again, maybe he's always been this good and I've just been underrating him in my head this whole time because I've never owned him before and I'm one of those same people who I was just talking about who always look down their nose at him. who knows lol. So to answer your question, I think it would be hard to get an equal or better return for him.

But if that ends up happening in conjunction with what happened in the finals this year, it becomes a much bigger story due to the obvious parallels with the basketball series and I think Cleveland will be on the receiving end of like 500% more ribbing and ridicule than they would have been if the Warriors/Cavs series never happened.

 3-1 jokes have already become probably the most espoused/beaten into the ground sports banter maybe of all time, certainly in the last decade at this point, and if the karmic cycle completes itsself and Cleveland blows a 3-1 lead.. 3-1 will become a meme that never dies",2016-10-31 23:32:48+00:00,d9g3yc3,4.0,t1_d9fofq3,19088.0,nba

86,"I disagree. I think you could make that argument. People are acting like it happens a couple times per game. It's literally happened like 3 times in his entire career, and it unfortunately happened in a couple situations last year where several factors (playing on potentially the best team ever, happening not only on national tv, not only during the playoffs, but in very high leverage situations in two very hyped up series, and happening multiple times in a small amount of time) came together to make it a thing, meme, media ticker fodder, etc and now his every move is extremely scrutinized. (It's also beside the point but I think you could make the argument that both the first knee to adams and the retailiatory arm flail at lebron both wouldnt have been given a second thought if Draymond nut stuff wasnt already a ""thing"") 

If you watch some of those clips I posted, it seems clear to me at least, that a) it's a relatively common motion that other players also engage in with some kind of frequency and b) it's something that Draymond just does a lot regardless of the situation, like for example where he does it when there isn't even anyone around him. 

Now, could you make the argument that it's dangerous and he needs to maybe ^\*ehem\* kick the habit? Absolutely. I just think he would have to be incredibly *incredibly* stupid to continue to do this intentionally after all that has happened and the repercussions he has suffered as a result. Like it would literally defy ALL logic. What could he possibly think that he would be able to gain? Unless you want to argue that he is mentally off in some way, I dont see how you could think that he's doing it on purpose in a *preseason game* no less.

All things here considered, it seems much more likely to me that this is just an unfortunate physical tick that he along with plenty of other players have and need to fix for the sake of player safety.",2016-10-22 22:31:22+00:00,d93jevp,6.0,t1_d93ih5v,1520.0,nba

90,"&gt;I never said ""anyone"". I'm only comparing Rodman to Dray 

lol ok? so how does that change my point at all? The thesis of your argument still remains that essentially ""Rodman had a crazier life so therefore Draymond isn't justified in his behavior since Rodman did the same stuff but had to go through way more hardship""

My point is that I don't see what Rodman has to do with anything in regards to this situation. It's a complete non sequitor. Dennis Rodman is just about as low as you can set the bar for someone having mental troubles as a result of going through a hell of a lot in a lifetime... so yeah just about 99% of the people you compare to him will seem better off in comparison. That doesn't mean that because Draymond or anyone else hasn't been through the exact same level of trauma that they are automatically 'fine'.

Again, I'm not saying there is anything wrong with Dray, he seems perfectly well adjusted to me, I just find your justifications for deeming whether a person is mentally troubled or not completely laughable.

Like the ridiculousness of your second sentence lmao... so partying = fine? got it. You know who else was seen out partying a lot? OJ Simpson. Kurt Kobain. Bruce Jenner.

I was pretty bummed that I was so close but didnt get it... then about five minutes later it came to my attention that sitting about five feet away from me in the crowd is motherfucking CARLOS SANTANA!!!

So during the intermission I work up the courage to go up to him and say something halfway cool and thoughtful and intelligent and I'm going over it in my head a couple times and its all good. Then I actually walk up to him and as soon as he makes eye contact with me I kinda black out and all logic and thinking goes out the window and I just start shaking his hand and thanking him for everything he's done. He was super gracious and kind and his wife is very beautiful. It was a very cool moment and I forgot all about the guitar pick I didn't catch haha.

I should also mention that he was called up on stage by Buddy and they jammed for about 20 minutes together and it was absolutely mind blowing. *AND* those two just happened to be the ""opening act"" for none other than Jeff Beck!

206,"&gt;perhaps a second revelation from this scene stems from what I mentioned earlier: ""it has never come up before"". If the Adderall had come up at any time prior to the most recent events in Rikers, Nas would have told the truth 100%, as he still thought that being honest would matter. When we see him in this last episode, it is apparent how much prison has already started to transform him, leaving him paranoid and defensive and even a bit brutish.

I think this is true to a certain extent (especially if you are talking about his behavior in general, not just this scene in particular), but I also think that his behavior in this specific scene can be attributed in large part to the fact that he was extremely nervous and sketched out and his mind was on the whole drug transaction that was going down and not what Stone was grilling him about. He was completely out of it. I think it remains to be seen until the next time we see him meet with Stone and Chandra whether or not his attitude towards them has actually changed that much or if he was just being short with them because he was understandably pretty distracted by the fact that he was discussing his own murder trial with his lawyers while simultaneously taking part in the commission of a felony drug deal. They could have been telling him the Yankees just offered him a 7 year contract and he probably would have reacted the same way he did..",2016-08-09 23:30:23+00:00,d6b3k30,4.0,t1_d6avwu4,10313.0,TheNightOf

Like is he officially getting worse according to his doctors or is this entire thread or people essentially eulogizing the guy just speculation based on a few seconds of cellphone video? I am genuinely curious, not trying to be a contrarian dick or anything here.

Clearly he has been greatly affected by his condition compared to what he looked like before he got sick but he honestly doesn't appear much physically different to me in this video than he did at any of his other recent public appearances since he returned to the sidelines (Espys, finals, various interviews during the regular season etc..). I do notice that he has some sort of abrasions/blistering on his facial skin which I assume is a result of his radiation treatment (and why the players are very careful not to bump his head) but he also had that going on in the video they played at the Espys (which was filmed months ago). He's also wearing short sleeves here, as opposed to his usual bulky suits so we are seeing the extent of his weight loss up close for the first time, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's anything new to him, just maybe new to us. The shirt itself also gives off kind of a hospital gown-y vibe which may also be having a small subliminal impact on how we are seeing him here.

Exactly.

It's their job to report the facts in a factual and honest manner. Windy is critical (but very fairly so, I find most of his criticisms to be pretty objectively ture) of the cavs all the time and if Lebron doesnt like it and wont be all buddy buddy with him because of it than so be it.

283,"&gt;He also made a career of following one man

I really don't understand why this upsets people. *It was his fucking job.* It's what he was assigned to do by his employer. And he did a great job at it so they continued to assign him to do it... it's not like he camped out on Lebron's doorstep for years before he was a journalist and collected a bunch of super secret intel and then leveraged his way into being a professional LeStalker.

He was a 22 year old kid fresh out of college working for a small town newspaper's sports beat, (probably ecstatic that he was able to get work in a creer he was passionate about directly out of school) when he was assigned to cover Lebron James, the local up and coming high school star, specifically because he had also attended the same high school as Lebron and would likely have some ties/be familiar with the scene there. Which would be preferable to sending some random middle aged outsider to do it.

Then by the divine miracle that is the NBA draft lottery, Lebron ends up going to a team less than an hour away from Windy's job in Akron (he didn't even move to a Cleveland newspaper until 2008, for fucks sake), so they basically change nothing and assign him to be their Cavs beat writer since he has been doing a bang up job so far and is clearly a sharp young reporter that is going places. At this time, while Lebron was the youngest player in the NBA, Windhorst was *the* youngest traveling beat writer in the NBA and probably all of sports. *Literally the Lebron of beat writers.* Can I get a show of hands how many people on this subreddit have been at the pinacle of their industry at 22? ok.

Then in 2008 he is offered a promotion to the Cleveland Plain Dealer, a big deal newspaper where he really starts to gain national attention. He has a book published and his print journalism wins national awards from the Basketball Writers Association of America and the Associated Press. Fuckin A.

Then, in another crazy turn of events, Lebron takes his talents to south beach, and in turn Windy is offered a fat multi million dollar deal by ESPN, which will allow him not only to further advance his career and raise his national profile by making regular national television/radio appearances and getting to work for what is essentially the mecca for any sports journalist wanting to make it big, *it forces him to move from northeast ohio to Miami fucking Beach!* CLEVELAND TO MIAMI, PEOPLE. 

Then Lebron goes back to Cleveland and Widny is offered his own nationally broadcast radio show. Dude has been knocking it out of the park for nearly two decades. But lets everyone just shit on him cuz man tits.

please PLEASE describe to me in detail how any of you self proclaimed basketball junkies would have done ANYTHING at all to diverge from the exact career trajectory that Brian Windhorst has taken. He was in the right place at the right time and had the talent and work ethic to capitalize on the opportunity.

But yeah and even when he got to Italy, the first season he played there wasn't even in the 1st division (although he did lead them to advance to the 1st division.)

But I think I would be a fair comparison to talk about him the same way we would about a decorated guy who stayed an extra year at school to chase another championship (I can't really think of anyone off the top of my head but I feel like there's a couple of Kentucky guys who have done that recently)",2016-07-05 20:14:38+00:00,d50g9re,10.0,t1_d50dett,3646.0,nba

Manu didnt even get to Europe until he was 21, AD was already playing at a pro level at that point. In terms of 'being developed as a pro for years' I think you could probably say that AD was much more subject to this process as a result of playing at Kentucky and doing top level AAU and high school stuff for several years even if not technically labeled as 'professional' as compared to Manu's experience at a mid level argentine basketball club 20 years ago when the level of competition for international ball was much lower than it is now.",2016-07-05 18:55:07+00:00,d50cixa,8.0,t1_d50bqle,986.0,nba

321,"Yeah I mean I feel like when you first start playing guitar you're making such unnatural shapes and motions with your fingers it doesnt really matter if you're right or left handed, it's going to be insanely uncomfortable and difficult either way for both hands. If you're starting completely from scratch, neither picking or fretting will be easy, so I don't see why it would make much of a difference if you use your less dominant hand for picking or fretting (probably even more so if we're talking about a six year old kid as opposed to an adult that might be much more permanently set in their handedness). They both require a pretty significant amount of motor skill, and you will quickly gain much more dexterity in your less dominant hand the more you play. 

It just seems like it would be worth it in the long run to work through the slight discomfort in the beginning (if there even is any) since being right handed means it will make your life as a guitar player like 100 times more convenient in every way.",2016-06-21 21:39:26+00:00,d4ik8b4,2.0,t1_d4idh71,8385.0,Guitar

I'm also not sure what part of my comment lead you to argue that I somehow said the favela's were not bad or that I was living in a priveledged area, but whatever floats your boat.

My mother is from Brazil, and I've been in Rio in the last 18 months, and other than the obvious cultural/climate related differences it's really not much different than any major american city. Sure there are bad parts, but that's gonna be true of any city with a population of 10 million+. As long as you dont stray too far off the beaten path you'll be fine. I walked around the city at all times of day and night and never felt like I was in any kind of danger. As with traveling in any unfamiliar place in the world, just be a savvy/not dumb visitor. Plus for events like the Olympics, world cup etc, there is lots of extra security, armed police on every other corner, stuff like that. It's even safer than it usually is.

Granted, Zika was not really on the radar while I was there, and that adds a whole other wrinkle to the situation. I agree with you on that point. But I would argue that for as much as people like to talk about crime/corruption/drugs etc, (and dont get me wrong, they are definitely big problems that need to be addressed,) I just dont think they will really have any impact on tourists who are staying at beachfront hotels in Rio for a week or two.

382,"I agree with pretty much everything you said. I think once they lost game 6, it was all over. Even when they had the lead for large portions of game 7, it never felt like they were a serious threat to win the game. It seemed pretty clear that they were really feeling the pressure of the situation. As soon as Klay and Curry made a couple shots in a row and the crowd really got into it and then OKC missed a couple shots.. you could tell all they were thinking about was *fuuuckkkk what if we actually blow this 3-1 lead*

But yeah, definitely gained a lot of respect for this team over the last couple weeks. I'd be happy if we didnt have to play them again for like another 10 years. If they keep there core together and are able to stay relatively healthy like they were this year, it seems almost impossible for them to not to get at least one ring sometime in the next 5 years.

My point was more so that I doubt he was hacked, this just seems like another one of his weird little quirks.

It sustains longer than any of my other guitars by a mile, it's super light, the neck and action are great and the 3 humbucker/3 volume knob setup is awesome. I've never played a guitar with 3 volume knobs before and you can get a tone of different tones out of it. I've only been able to play it for a couple hours since it came so I feel like I've barely even scratched the surface of what it can do. 

So I would definitely reccomend the Epiphone for OP especially if you look around pretty thoroughly and can get a good deal.

448,"&gt;Gary Clark Jr is a monster though. Love his style

Yeah as far as his studio albums go, I really like some of his stuff, other stuff I can do without, I find him kind of hit or miss in that regard and I think his songwriting (lyrically) can sometimes leave a little to be desired. But man... then I saw him live and it was incredible. I was pretty close to the front and the guy melted my fucking face off. He played for 2 hours and I didnt hear a single song I didnt love. Amazing show. I'd encourage anyone who has the chance to go see him in person.

Wow. Fucking bravo man. Couldn't have said it any better. As much as I love it here, sometimes I feel like this concept is utterly and completely lost on like 99% of /r/nba posters.

As for my personal 2 cents, I'd recommend that if you have multiple guitars, designate one that you'll use strictly for slide playing so you can optimize it for that purpose, e.g raising the action a little higher off the fretboard than usual, throwing some higher gauge strings on, leaving it in open tunings, etc.. stuff that otherwise might be counter productive to your normal playing but will enhance your slide playing.",2016-04-04 19:53:20+00:00,d1pqqo0,1.0,t3_4dbzn6,10269.0,Guitar

I'd genrally agree with you that the draft is a ""who the fuck knows"" type of deal for a lot of teams, but I think in the case of teams like GSW/OKC/SAS where they consistently hit on their draft picks, you have to give at least some credit and not just chalk it all up to it being pretty much a crapshoot that they got lucky in.",2016-03-14 20:23:28+00:00,d0zrd2a,8.0,t1_d0zoc2h,4069.0,nba

699,"&gt;it's a **known fact** that NBA height listing are almost **never accurate**

Based on what exactly? That's a pretty bold assertion. I grant you that there are maybe some cases of guys like KG and KD who don't want to have the 7-footer stigma etc and have an inch knocked off their listing but if it's your position that players' official listed heights are that unreliable than I don't think I can really even argue with you anymore. By that logic we have absolutely no idea how tall anyone actually is so what's the point in even discussing it?

&gt;Shaq, a man who stands 7'2"" says that there's no way that Yao is only 4 inches taller than him

Again, maybe you have your doubts about the official NBA listings, but a caption from Shaq's instagram where he is literally doing the exact same thing as you or I would do (eyeballing Yao and guessing how tall he is) is now supposed to be taken as some sort of infallible source? And also, if you don't believe Yao is 7'6 then why do you suddenly think that shaq being 7'2 is so set in stone? Like where do you draw the line on who's heights to believe are truthful. Thanks, but I think I'll take my chances with the listed stats.

&gt;I think you confuse what makes something have clear evidence/proof, what is partial proof, and what is ""worthless"". Pictures are never ""absolutely worthless"" for heights comparisons. Because you can see in the pic I provided that Ming Ming and Yao are likely within the same range of heights

I think you misunderstand my use of worthless. Yes, obviously they are useful in being able to determine if people are in the same *range* of height, but they *are* pretty much worthless if you're talking about being able to *accurately* compare two people to within an inch or two when they are already 90+ inches tall...

Like I don't think you understand that when we're talking about comparing things on a scale as tiny as a few inches, there is *zero* room for any kind of margin of error. You keep throwing around terms like ""Shaq is *around*"" or ""he *thinks* it's closer"" or ""he *looks* at most""... Like I pointed out in my previous comment, there are a thousand little variables that can effect how tall someone appears to look by a few inches. And so when our whole argument is based a difference of only a few inches, it makes the entire debate completely moot unless there is ZERO margin of error, which there will always be in a photo unless it's set up like I said before.

702,"How could you possibly deduce anything from this picture? You can't even see the lower halves of their bodies.. They're standing several feet apart, you have no idea who is standing closer to the camera or what kind of shoes they are each wearing, how level the ground they are standing on is. The camera man is right of center in this photo which skews the angle you're seeing, and Yao is also leaning his head slightly forward while the other guy is leaning slightly back. For all you know Yao is standing on a really thick rug or something like that that ends before it gets to the other guy. 

All of these factors could easily account for a perceived difference of 2-3 inches. Especially since inches are really damn small and it would be tough to make a solid judgement in the range of 2 or 3 inches when it comes to two eight foot tall guys just by eyeballing it even under ideal circumstances. If Yao Ming was *officially* listed at 7'6 by the NBA I'm not sure why you'd think that that measurement would be less accurate than you speculating over some random photo of him from where he's only visible from the waist up.

99% of pictures are absolutely worthless for comparing heights of players unless they are standing fully straight up, standing back to back with the camera perfectly level to their heads and a ruler right behind them.",2016-02-14 21:57:53+00:00,czzyxtm,4.0,t1_czzxma7,2272.0,nba

The biggest thing I'm worried about now is that he'll end up on a team that doesn't have any games at Oracle left this season and that he'll miss out on getting his ring in front of the home crowd and we'll end up just giving it to him at some random point in the offseason with little to no fanfare. I want so badly for him to be able to have his moment in front of a packed arena and be able to soak it all in one last time, and for the rest of us fans to be able to see it on tv.

If you had told me this news 3 or 4 years ago, I'd have been foaming at the mouth for any chance of success and national relevance, but things are different now. I'm really proud of the way we built this team from the ground up and the fact that like half the guys on our roster were drafted by us. After winning with a group like that, it almost feels like cheating to pull a move like this. I want to keep this homegrown core together for as long as possible and prove that we can keep winning the way we've been doing it.

Bands that actually sing and  play instruments live and have to worry about a thousand different variables that will affect the way the crowd hears their music are usually pretty anal about sound related stuff, even when you're talking about pretty low level artists. Obviously for hiphop there are exceptions, like the awesome albums listed by the other guy that replied to you, but for the most part, rappers just have the DJ play their instrumental (and a lot of times it isn't even the instrumental it's just the actuall song, so what you end up hearing is just the artist screaming out random lines from the song over the sound of their own voice) over the PA system and they yell out the lyrics, and usually the volume levels are fucked and either the music is too loud or the mic is and the end result is just a really terrible and shitty sounding compared to the original song that you had come to know and love, whereas in my experience, the opposite is usually true with bands, where I end up feeling the live performance way more than the studio track.

The only way this quote would make sense as a Cavs reference is if he was trying to make a GM Lebron joke, because then the GM would literally be in the locker room. But I'm pretty sure Pop has way too much respect for Lebron as a man and a competitor to make a silly little joke like that at his expense. That really isn't Pop's style at all.

Maybe it's just because I don't get the chance to go to many games in person, but I would've never forgiven myself for being there *in person* and still completely missing out on such an epic playoff win ",2016-01-06 07:00:44+00:00,cynsx6b,10.0,t1_cynsck0,1612.0,nfl

826,"2nd season of Fargo was one of the best seasons of TV of all time I think. 1st season was kinda 'meh' in my opinion. I thought it was a travesty that fargo won the emmy over season one of true detective. The plot/writing is great, on par with season two even, the downfall for me was the actors. I disliked pretty much every actor outside of Billy Bob Thorton and maybe the deaf guy and his buddy. Colin Hanks and the hobbit guy and the lady cop and dennis and the supermarket owner just really didn't do it for me. Found all of them pretty boring/unlikable. 

The setting, acting and cinematography for season two just completely blows everything from season one out of the water.

I think you're not fully grasping the damage that changing teams for a 3rd time in half a decade would cause in regards to his legacy. A player of Lebron's caliber doesn't have the mindset that legacy is 'cool'. Legacy is everything to him. He isn't gonna hop on the first train out of town as soon as a marginally better situation presents itself. Not to mention that line of thinking almost doesn't apply to Lebron.. he IS the better situation. whatever team he's on is automatically gonna be in contention for the top spot, it's not like he needs to follow anyone else around.
