Is there any way I can reduce the cost of either of the builds even further? I'm new to this and I may have used something not really needed and hiked the price. Or I may have used a part that I could have used an alternate cheaper one. Do the specs match the value?",2016-07-15 05:26:31+00:00,d5cz78d,2.0,t1_d5cyg49,1677.0,buildapc

This is just a final project I need to create on Layer edit, but I'm trying get the layering done before I start working on L-edit. I have this as my final copy, hopefully this is correct.
