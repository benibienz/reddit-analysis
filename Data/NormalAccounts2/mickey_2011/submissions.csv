So I'm on day 14, this is my probably millionth try, but this is the first time I've gotten here. I think I'm in the flatline stage right now. I've been watching porn and masturbated since I was 12 and I'm 22 right now, so 10 years, and I know that I have PIED and suffer from premature ejactulation. My question is, that will 90 days fix this? Or would I need to keep going and going? Because at the moment, it seems like it's worse than what it was when I was fapping. I don't get morning wood anymore (ever since last week) and I just can't get turned on at all and it's scaring me.

So I have an assignment, where I am given two planes to compare, the Boeing 307 and the de Havilland Comet, and given the following differences:
- Windows on the Boeing were circular and on the de Havilland Comet, they were square-ish
- Both planes were made from the same materials.
- The Boeing 307 cruised at 20000 ft, and the Comet cruised at 35000 ft.
- Both kept the cabin altitude at an equivalent of 8000 ft.
- The Comet was ~25% larger and ~60% heavier than the Boeing

Why did the Boeing not have the same problem as the Comet? Show this by calculation and list all assumptions (barometer values and atmospheric pressure values at the altitudes is provided, crack length, width and/or radius of curvature at tip not given).
-------END QUESTION---------

Okay, so Ive been at this for a few hours and here is all that I know and have found out:
- Because the windows were square-ish, there was stress buildup around the abrupt edges, and this created stress concentrations.
- Round windows, stress flows freely around curved edges with minimal buildup.
- Because there was stress buildup near the Comet's windows, there was major metal fatigue, which caused a crack that went up to the fuselage of the plane, and therefore there was an explosion.

------END OF WHAT I KNOW-------

So my questions is, how do I prove this in calculation? I have no idea where to start, if someone could just point me to the right direction, I would probably be able to do this.
