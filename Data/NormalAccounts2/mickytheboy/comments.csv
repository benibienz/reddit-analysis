I think the key to most dark souls bosses is not to do greedy-hits.",2016-11-13 14:03:03+00:00,d9yf3hu,4,t1_d9x8gvv,80624,darksouls3
1,"Yes that's what I meant by DS3 being the most polished.  They took little elements from DS1 + 2 and refined them, made them more accessible and player-friendly.  If you compare DS1 to DS3 side by side, I definitely agree DS3 is the more finished and refined game,maybe even more fun.

But when DS1 came out it was so innovative and had a lasting impact on the whole game industry, it is a legendary game.

What I am disappointed about DS3 is its lack of ground-breaking innovative game play designs/mechanics that transcends it from a good game to a legendary game.  Maybe you'll say I am setting the bar too high but it's Miyazaki we're talking about here!

It's like if Stanley Kubrick makes a decent film its not enough because he is supposed to make legendary films.",2016-11-11 12:07:23+00:00,d9vqe5f,2,t1_d9ux6me,52484,darksouls3
