I think the biggest problem with Dark Souls 3 is that, as the third installment in the franchise, there's no ground-breaking gameplay mechanics that add to the novelty, like DS1 did.

Yes there are a lot of minor tweaks, but nothing revolutionary in terms of game play.  I do agree that it is the most polished, accessible out of the three but I also think it didn't live up to its potentials.

I remember when news of DS3 first came out they said there will be the sacrifices to make bonfires mechanic which I think it's really cool but they didn't use.  Heat up mentioned in the video is also cool, with the bosses changing behaviors according to what you did the game - that can truly add to the lore!

I think From Software kinda rushed the release a bit.
Dark Souls 2 - 2014
Bloodborne - 2015
Dark Souls 3 - 2016

If they had taken another 1-1.5 years  for development to implement new ideas and polish them that would be better, since 2.5 years for an AAA game isn't too long a wait anyway.

Don't get me wrong, I did really enjoy the game which I think it's good, but could be greater.  Now, after more than half a year since its released, I think it's pretty obvious that DS3 wouldn't join the video game hall of fame alongside Mario like DS1 did.  It's just another decent game that people apart from fans will forget when the next wave of games come in.
