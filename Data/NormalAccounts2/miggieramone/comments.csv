The leather, build and toughness is the same. The main difference is that the 1461 is tapered across the top of the foot, due to the eyelets starting a inch higher than where the eyelets start on the 1460. Because of this taper, the 1461 is a little bit more sleeker and wants badly to be a oxford. This kind of kills the esthetic of the shoe for me. Where as the 1460 can be worn with a band shirt, the 1461 looks out of place with anything other than a collared shirt. Hope this helps.

382,"Seriously. I had to abandon iTunes match after two years of greatness. After deleting some artist from match, I went to my phone to make sure everything looked good and my meta data was all over the place. Some albums were under the wrong artist, some songs were labeled wrong and albums split in half with the artist showing up twice. It was a random freakout. I spent most of the weekend trying to fix it and it wouldn't change a thing. So bummed I had to go back to synch my phone through iTunes. I called iTunes customer service and they told me they couldn't do anything and that since Apple Music is coming out not to worry about iTunes match. So bummed.

387,"I've been wondering the same thing. My iTunes match sub expires on the 6th of July. From what I've read, you can match and upload songs, similar to iTunes match, with Apple music. I think the only difference is that with Apple music, you can't keep the Apple version premonitory. Only stream and save for offline mode.
