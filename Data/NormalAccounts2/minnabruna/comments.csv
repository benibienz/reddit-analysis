&gt;North Dakota Highway Patrol Captain Bryan Niewind said in a press conference the issue is not that drones were flying near law enforcement, but that authorities were surveying the area with manned aircraft while the drones were in the air...Niewind claimed the drone came within 30 to 50 feet of the helicopter’s blades. 

&gt;Dedman admits he knew the helicopter was in the vicinity, but denies flying too close to the helicopter or in a threatening manner. He estimates that he was flying at 50 feet above ground level (AGL) or below, while the helicopter was flying between 200 and 300 feet AGL. Dedman says the ""helicopter was not even close."" 

&gt;“[Law enforcement is saying that] because they’re breaking their laws and they’re using that [excuse] to justify what they’ve done by shooting the drones,” he says.

&gt;The police said the risk of a helicopter potentially crashing due to a drone pushed them to “take the drone out.” Once the drone headed away from the helicopter, authorities began firing toward the drone (which they say was flying over an open field).

&gt;The FAA says it is “aware of the incident and we are investigating.”

&gt; Legally, drones are considered aircraft, which means shooting down a drone is federal crime.

&gt;However, some states have drafted laws to allow police officers to shoot down drones on a state level (one successfully passed in Utah, which allows officials to shoot down or jam a drone interfering with firefighting efforts). At this point in time, Drone360 is unaware of a law that says enforcement officials are allowed to shoot at or shoot down UAS in North Dakota.

&gt;“Regardless of the situation, shooting at any aircraft — including unmanned aircraft — poses a significant safety hazard. An unmanned aircraft hit by gunfire could crash, causing damage to persons or property on the ground, or it could collide with other objects in the air,” the FAA told Forbes in April.

&gt;But the legal questions go far beyond the scope of shooting down an aircraft.

&gt;Dedman claims the helicopter was flying at such a low altitude (roughly between 200 and 300 feet AGL) that it was breaking FAA regulations. Morton County Sheriff’s Office claims the drones flying in the air, including Dedman’s, were in violation of FAA regulations for “the use of drones around unprotected people and manned aircraft.”",2016-11-21 21:32:45+00:00,daa2qg5,4.0,t1_daa1jok,1404.0,environment

7,"For starters, Dubai is *not* the capital of the UAE. That is Abu Dhabi. You seem very certain for someone who doesn't know the basic facts.

Secondly, Dubai is not awash with petroleum. It did use petroleum income to fund initial development, but now less than 20% of its GDP comes from that sector, and a portion of that comes form being a business hub, not actual extraction). 

Abu Dhabi has a lot more petroleum, and uses it in its ongoing tussle with Dubai for influence (Dubai likes to be independent of Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi likes to dominate Dubai, often Dubai wins but in the 2008 crash Dubai was way overextended in international investments and Abu Dhabi bailed them out, thereby helping the latter's position).

Also, I did not quote any specific statistics, but if you are referring to the fact that Dubai is something like 10% citizen and the rest if foreigners, that is true. Dubai is very foreign. It is very segregated and that remaining 90% has little hope of ever becoming a citizen, so it is not like Singapore, but you still have you facts wrong on this part too.

The fact that there is money to make in Dubai is in a significant part due to the petroleum money surrounding Dubai, but that is not where Dubai itself gets it, and it is not what Dubai is dependent on. 

Dubai never had great petroleum reserves, and got its start with Indian gold sales and favorable, tax-avoiding transshipment regulations, and has been building on that model ever since.  

Dubai depends on being seen by enough people with money from outside Dubai viewing it as a relatively safe and stable place to invest, transit or launder it.

44,"It is quite possible to buy residential property as a foreigner and I know people who have and are very happy. I would be very surprised if anti-foreigner feeling extended to already-owned residential property. That is a very drastic step that few countries ever take. There are things to be aware of, however. 

Get an agent and have them provide a lawyer. Spend time on this - not all are as responsive or proactive as they are in the West. So reach out to many and see whom you like best. Check all terms - do you know if you are getting shell and core, a turn-key unit, etc? What is the history of this developer and development? 

Be aware that if you are not a registered resident (residence permit, registered address), you will have to pay a tax of 30% of the total sale price of a residential property if you sell it.  Many expats and non-resident Russians get around this by putting the property in the name of a company registered abroad, and then selling that company when they sell, but you have to do that in advance.

Can you pay the full price or do you need a mortgage? Getting a mortgage in Russia may be hard for several reasons - need income there (do you have it?), inflation and economic insecurity mean that rates are high, who system isn't as mature so that establishing credit worthiness is onerous and the duration isn't as long.  If you have income from abroad with which to pay it (don't lock yourself into paying in euros or dollars if you have to pay the mortgage form your ruble income), getting a mortgage pegged to an outside, more stable currency may help. 

Also be aware that you may be asked to pay cash. This is a system whereby the actual sale happens in the bank. You make an appointment to withdraw the cash, which is counted and then locked in a safety deposit box. The seller transfers the property to your name and then they get the key, and promptly redeposit the cash into their account. 

The problem with this, is that if you are not a VIP-level customer of the bank, the bank will charge you a painful commission (could be 5%) to simply give you your cash. Talk to your agent/lawyer on setting up a wire transfer and escrow, possibly abroad if it isn't available in-country.  If this new building is being sold by a single developer, then they may be flexible. Talk to the bank about getting an upgrade to a better status. You can also try to find a bank that you also bank with abroad, so that more assets/history can be considered when assigning you a lower-commission status. 

Also, you say the apartments are being converted, not already converted. How much longer is there to go? One reads horror stories of people paying in advance for projects that never finish and losing their money.  Again, the lawyer and agent should help you work out how much time is less (the closer to being finished, the better) and what payment is available (the less paid until completion, the better).  Does it have to be those apartments exactly? If not, a completed unit ready to move in may be less risky (what is your interested price range? I may sell you mine for the right price :).)

46,"**The Outed Gays (and others)**

Wikileaks published [records from the Saudi government](http://www.advocate.com/media/2016/8/23/wikileaks-outs-saudi-gay-man-rape-victims-and-more) that included that of gay people, as well as rape victims, medical records, financial data, and information relating to paternity disputes, custody fights, etcetera.

In Saudi Arabia the government can be quite paternalistic, and people in trouble can apply directly to the government for help with a specific problem (and often do, especially when abroad).

I've seen some people try to brush aside these disclosures by saying that any gay people in government documents are already known to the state, so they aren't at any more risk if they are outed. 

That is a very short-sighted view to take. Gays in the West had to stay closeted for much longer than they feared criminal prosecution because being outed meant losing their families, their jobs, their friends and facing harassment, discrimination and sometimes even violence. 

It is like that in Saudi today. If anything, it is worse, because people live in very large family and social networks. A Saudi gay person can't move alone to Saudi San Fransisco and built a life of their own. If they are outed, is is family, social, educational and professional death.  It also hurts their loved ones, as reputation is everything and they will also be mistrusted as coming from a family that raises perverts, so possibly also deviant.

This reputation issue applies to the other victims of this leak as well. In everyone they know and work with know of these problems and it will hurt and humiliate them. All of it, from their sexual orientation to their health, was their secret to keep if they wanted to, and I am sure that most did.

(I lived in KSA and can assure these risks are quite serious). 

Perversely, censorship is the one thing that protects them. Wikileaks is blocked in Saudi so many people's best hope to avoid the destruction of their lives is that the people who can't find out probably won't find the information with a casual search. Wikileaks gave the censors a very powerful pro-censorship argument in the domestic debate over freedom of information.

**The Syrian Censorship**

A hacktivist gorup calling itself RevoluSec hacked financial records of Assad's government in Syria. They gave them to Wikileaks, who published them. however, [the version Wikileaks published was missing some of the stolen records](http://www.dailydot.com/layer8/wikileaks-syria-files-syria-russia-bank-2-billion/), specifically a record of a transfer of more than 2 billion dollars from a Russian state-owned bank to Assad's government. 

Assange's preference for Russia is not a secret. You don't have to look at actions in favor of Russia's in this past election to try and see it. Assange [took a paid job](https://www.rt.com/tags/the-julian-assange-show/) appearing in the Russian state-owned [propaganda outlet Russia Today](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT_(TV_network). Pussy Riot's Nadia Tolokno (herself a pretty radical freedom actor) even said that she visited Assange and tried to convince him not to support the Russian government because of its authoritarianism, but he wouldn't agree because his personal fight with the US is [more important to him than the greater ethics/freedoms issue](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/10/27/pussy-riot-s-nadya-tolokno-julian-assange-is-connected-with-the-russian-government.html).  

So, when Wikileaks doesn't have a problem outing innocent Saudi's very private, completely innocent, information at the risk of destroying their lives, but did find the time to remove a record major cash support from Russia to Assad's government, the party accused of killing more civilians than any other in Syria's civil war, it is difficult for me to take any expressions of concern for people's privacy or the risk of exposure seriously.

47,"Making the gays situation public is potentially catastrophic to them. They don't just fear prosecution. They fear being outed to, and ostracized from, their extended family and social circles that make up their entire personal, educational and professional worlds.  They fear that their ""perversion"" will damage the reputation of their loved ones as well, and thereby hurt their chances in life.  They fear prejudice and violence that aren't in the form of official criminal charges.

Gay people weren't the only victims of the leaks either. Records of petitioners for help for a range of things were there. Debtors, teenage rape victims, medical records, financial data, and information relating to paternity disputes, custody fights, anyone who turned to the state for help (the government there will intervene directly in your personal problems in some circumstances) now have their problems out in the open. 

Perversely, censorship is the one thing that protects them. Wikileaks is blocked in Saudi so many people's best hope to avoid the destruction of their lives is that the people who can't find out probably won't find the information with a casual search. Wikileaks' thoughtless act gave the censors a very powerful pro-censorship argument in the domestic debate over freedom of information.

48,"You do not understand how being Gay, Wikileaks' actions or Saudi Arabia work if you think that the fact that authorities knew that means they faced no risks or problems. 

Have you read even one of the article talking to the affected people? They are panicked, and not because of the authorities. They are panicked because now their families, social circle and professional circles can know and they will lose everything if that happens. 

So yes, the authorities knew.  It was the authorities' documents that were stolen. 

But now everyone in an outed gay person's life can know, thanks to Wikileaks cruel act.  Being gay is illegal, but gay people aren't a top law enforcement priority. Especially gay Saudis living in other countries, as many of the leak victims were. For many gay people, it is social, familial, educational and professional death though. 

Their relatives are also at risk, for being known as from a family that has deviant perverts means that they are also unlikely to be trusted as ""suitable"" for marriage, work etc. 

Do you not know that until very recently, most Western gays had to remain closeted, even without a death penalty or even criminal charges hanging over their heads. They still had their personal and professional lives to lose.  Some still do. In Saudi it is like that, on a very severe scale in no small part because of how large people""s familial and social networks are, and how important they are to any part of life. A gay person can't just start a new life on their own in a Saudi San Fransisco. 

And then there are the other people who were outed were people in debt asking for money, rape victims, sick people and their medical records, financial data, and information relating to paternity disputes and custody fights, etcetera. They were people who had appealed to the Saudi authorities for help with these problems.  That's why their records were there to leak. These are all things that are now in the public domain to be found about them. They aren't death penalty crimes but they are things the people didn't want known. 

It was a very bad thing that Wikileaks did to those people. Perversely, if anything saves them, it is that Wikileaks is censored in Saudi Arabia so most people won't come across the documents in a casual search. Wikileaks' thoughtless act also gave the censors a very powerful pro-censorship argument in the domestic debate over freedom of information. They can point to this and find a receptive audience saying that their censorship really is in the public interest and free information is not in the public interest.

[I wrote about it previously here:](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1oyj59/fuck_you_bed_bugs_and_fuck_you_ramada/)

&gt;I practice good personal hygiene.

&gt;I like to think that I am a reasonably attractive female. Cute even.

&gt;But right now I am disgusting.

&gt;I have at least 207 red, raised welts with crusty scabs on top. There is one on the dip right above my upper lip. There is one in the curve under my eyebrow. They are on my face, my neck, my shoulders, my back, my chest, my arms, my hands, my legs, my feet. Wearing my engagement and weddings rings, rings that I love so very much, is uncomfortable because there are two bites where they rest on my finger.

&gt;I am gross. I am shocking. I look like I have a revolting skin disease. I catch people gawking at me in yoga class. People at work shrink from having to shake my hand, forcing me to say “don’t worry, its not contagious.” It has been two weeks and I still look like this. I don’t see a real improvement.

&gt;I’m also more sensitive and quick to anger than usual because I’m not sleeping well and I itch all the time.
Why? Because I stayed at the Ramada and, while I slept, tiny bloodsucking parasitic bed bugs crawled out from the mattress and all over me. And bit me. 207 times. At least.

&gt;Fuck you bed bugs. Fuck being ugly. Fuck repelling strangers. Fuck the itches, fuck the pain, fuck the terrible feeling, fuck the trip I took to the hospital where the doctor traced the bites across my skin with her finger, demonstrating the path that a particular bug took as it crawled and bloodsucked its way across me.

&gt;Fuck feeling disgusting. Fuck agreeing with the people I repel. Fuck caking myself in makeup and still worrying about my appearance ruining important meetings at work. Fuck well-meaning people asking if I’m OK. Fuck having people reassure me that I am still hygienic, as if there was a doubt and that I somehow brought this on myself by being dirty. Fuck hiding my hands below the counter as I pay for things. Fuck scaring my little niece.
Fuck just feeling bad all of the time. These bites itch like nothing I’ve ever felt. I scratch them in my sleep. They itch so much I can’t sleep. They hurt and itch at the same time. The medicinal mousse helps, but it smells. Fuck making my house smell like a hospital while my friend is visiting from abroad.

&gt;Fuck throwing away my favorite suitcase. Fuck running my fragile and expensive work clothes in the dryer on high to kill any bugs hiding within them. Fuck stripping every fabric off of every surface that I touched at home and spending two days frying them too. Fuck freaking out every time I feel a stray hair across my face that I did bring bedbugs home, that they are in our bed, that they are biting me in my sleep again. That they will bite my husband and he will think that I am disgusting for bringing parasitic insects into our home.

&gt;Fuck all of that.

&gt;And fuck you Ramada.

&gt;Fuck you Ramada customer service line for not even pretending to sound like you care when I called you from the emergency room because the welts were growing so fast across my face I thought I was going into anaphylactic shock.

&gt;Fuck for lying when you said that someone would call me back.

&gt;Fuck you for sending me a letter explaining that, while the hotel said Ramada on the booking site, the hotel has a giant Ramada sign over the building and the bill itself says Ramada, that the hotel is in fact not a Ramada, but rather a franchise, which is somehow magically a totally unrelated entity, and that you let that entity know that they have a bed bug problem but that you, Ramada, have nothing to do with it.

&gt;Fuck that remote owner too, who will also never contact me.

&gt;All I really wanted was to tell you that you had a problem, and hear a little sympathy. I wasn’t even trying to get my suitcase replaced, or to be reimbursed for the portions of the hospital visit, the dermatologist visit, the prescriptions or the OTC medications not covered by my health insurance. I wanted to protect the next unsuspecting guest.

&gt;But all you did was do your best to remove yourself so fast from any potential responsibility that I worry that you care more about that than the fact that, right now, in your hotel, some trusting customer is sleeping as little bloodsucking insects crawl across their face, biting them like they did me.

They are doing something kinda shady. They are using a transmitter to overpower the regular commercial GPS signal to signal (or rather spoof, or sending false signals) that they aren't the Kremlin, but rather that they are a Moscow airport some 30km away. 

This is most likely because drones, which use the commercial GPS signal, are programmed to automatically not fly over airports and because that airport, Vnukovo, is the first alphabetically on the Moscow airports list (V is the 3rd letter in Russian/Cyrillic).

About a year ago a tourist got in trouble trying to fly his drone over the Kremlin and ever since they've been freaking out about drone espionage and drone attack (this makes sense when you consider the general environment of freaking out about regular espionage and attacks).

113,"As someone who lived in America and is currently living in Germany, I can say the US beats Germany in friendliness and openness to other countries and cultures, everyday quality of life, as well as business environment.

For all of the U-S-A arrogant American stereotype, I hear a lot more smug/superior statements in Germany, particularly from people who don't know the areas they decry. America is an international place, and urban, educated Americans at least are more sophisticated and more sensitive to other cultures and countries. You would never hear an American who has never been to Europe go out of their way to tell a visiting German what they don't like about their home country, for example. 

Doing something other than the way an American thinks you should be doing something isn't cause for them to condemn, insult or dismiss someone.

Efficiency. Doing anything takes twice as long here, requires waiting for someone to get around to finally doing their job, requires fallow-up and attention to make sure they do it right, and then more waiting. Suspicion of the Internet extends to inaccurate or just no information online. Finding anything takes a lot longer. Anything with the government is extremely bureaucratic and takes a long time.  

If I order something here, there is a good chance the delivery guy will lie about ever even trying my apartment before taking advantage of the pensioner down the street. That would never happen in the US. US delivery people are paid an hourly or annual wage and are held accountable for their deliveries. In Germany they are paid piecemeal and the companies don't insist on honest and prompt deliveries. 

The food is far behind the US (or Austria, which is a similar cuisine, but with better recipes and ingredients. There is a reasons that I see so many Austrian restaurants here, but no German ones there). ""Foreign"" restaurants are often like American ones in the 80s would be - eingedeutsched (americanized in the US) and not very good. Grocery store selection is relatively limited, even in expensive stores. 

Bravery. In Germany, if you fail once, you are a failure. This inhibits business and creative ventures. In America, it means you are trying. I sat through an hour-long discussion by serious politicians bemoaning how US and Israeli startups are beating German ones. No one talked about changing the culture and mentality here. They did talk about regulations to restrict the outside competition. 

Medical insurance in the US is a mess when you are not a full-time employee getting it through your job. However, for the majority, it is not.  As someone who had insurance through my job in the US and now has oh-so-fancy private insurance in Germany. I would love to have my US insurance back. It cost much less and I got better care. The overall level of care itself is also better - here you respect the doctor so much you can't question them and they don't answer many questions without prompting. The offices are disorganized and getting to the expert caregivers is hard. Information on care providers is not easily available. There are so few midwives thanks to the German insurance rules and difficult working conditions that women have to sign up for a midwife the moment they take a pregnancy test or risk not getting even standardized care while pregnant. Rehab centers in Germany have waiting lists. And so on.

US Politics is a real nightmare, but having recently gone through an AFD and Linke election here, such groups together have a similar share here as the Trumpkins in the US. Many other Western European countries have similar issues and Eastern Europe is even more messed up. I wouldn't be so quick to declare Europe so superior in this regard. 

Culture. Traditional culture is strong in parts of Germany, there are some good artists, and Berlin is a major techno center, but much of the rest is derivative and a few years behind the US.

Wealth inequality is bad for society long term. Even with it, the quality/comfort of average life is higher in the US for most people. Things are cheaper, more goods and services are available, and so people can live better. Money is a part of this, you are right, but it has an effect on life.

People in the US do work more and are more proactive. They seem to do this as a culture and they aren't all overstressed and miserable, but more vacation days are definitely nice. On the flip side, people in the US take their jobs seriously and are generally more reliable. I don't experience the same frustrations in the US that I do here trying to deal with vendors, service providers, my landlord, etc. In German companies where the standard of work is important, like my office, people do take it seriously, but they also work hard and for serious hours similar to their US counterparts.

You are right about the car in some areas. I like just having a bike here. But not everywhere. In major cities you can do without. 

TLDR There are reasons to prefer W. Europe and reasons to prefer the US. Your inaccurate stereotype-based judgements aren't really part of those reasons, however.

When Foo Foo died, he gave it a four-day Buddhist funeral with participation from monks.  

He lives mostly in Germany where he drives very expensive cars and gets involved in what the Wikileaks State Department cables described as ""embarrassing financial transactions.""  He is known there for his hard partying lifestyle. The gossip reports talk about his poor health after decades of that hard partying.

He hasn't been involved in politics or even much of Thailand, and made little effort to educate himself for the role he now fills. He did purge people close to his father he didn't see as supportive of him. He's also accepted expensive gifts and favored one side of Thailand's ongoing deep political tensions, a stark contrast to his father who was famous for hid efforts to play a mediating role. He is rumored to have ties to organized crime as well.  

And those tattoos are fake. He has been seen in Bavaria in a similar outfit with different versions. 

Military education is a common path for royalty world-wide and they get a lot of help if they need it. That alone doesn't say much, and his entire life since shows that he is not a good candidate. The sad thing is, he has sisters who could be good choices, including an older sister, Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, who lives in Thailand and is respected. But she is a woman, so this joker and his officer pets get the job. ",2016-10-14 19:50:37+00:00,d8s72an,3.0,t1_d8rmsrr,26972.0,WTF

128,"I don't want to say for certain since I'm not in HR, but most companies would be using that government record as their background check (Führungszeugnis). Therefore, if the government did not record it, the company won't know about it, even if they do demand a Führungszeugnis/background check.  

I am not sure exactly what type of industry/subject matter you are interested in, but there probably won't be a background check requirement for interns if you aren't interested in IT or something related to security anyway, and even then maybe not for an intern.   

A quick German-language for Führungszeugnis AND internship found mostly jobs working with children requiring them. A search for Führungszeugnis AND BMW found a discussion of their IT-team requirements. I expect you'll pass if you need one, but it doesn't look like you will. 

If a company did find out, I could see things going either way. A security-oriented internship may have a requirement for a clean official record. A clean-official-record-only policy could be hard to overcome.  However, the actual ""crime"" of drinking alcohol at 20 is not going to concern most people here, so it could still be fine. I can tell you in my personal experience that no one at my office cares that people drink alcohol in Saudi Arabia where it is always illegal. 

I wouldn't worry too much about this. It is very unlikely that a company would conduct a check and then find it in a check. 

If you are worried, you can find out in advance. Don't actually say ""will a background check be needed?"" (that will scare them that you may have done something really terrible). Just ask what the requirements are if they aren't listed already. I was told in an interview and in my formal contract/offer letter that a Führungszeugnis was required. At that point, if I thought that would be a problem, I could have chosen to look elsewhere/ declined the job as not a good fit.

130,"I assume you got this charge in the United States?

In that case I could not worry. In the unlikely event that, as an intern, you do have some sort of a background check, it will likely be a [Führungszeugnis](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%BChrungszeugnis), which is done by the government here and won't be by an internationally-focused background service. 

According to [this](https://www.bundesjustizamt.de/DE/Themen/Buergerdienste/BZR/Inhalt/Fragen/FAQ_node.html;jsessionid=20D3D89620886991D7698F8BEBC3AAAD.1_cid377#faq4153640), foreign convictions are only recorded if:

1. The convicted person is German, born in Germany or German resident 
2. The convicted could have faced punishment for such a crime in Germany.
3.  The decision is final and legally binding.



Number 1 didn't apply to you so Germany wouldn't be interested and I don't expect that the state where you charged for underaged drinking reports convictions to Germany for this. 
Number 2 also doesn't apply.
As for number 3, I'm not sure how a plea deal doesn't make you not convicted (did you plead guilty and the court accepted that? Because that counts as convicted), but if you really do have some open-ended status then this also won't apply.

Basically, it looks like you're fine. 

I had to get a Führungszeugnis for my job, and the biggest piece of advice that I can give is that, the moment you know that you will need one, [make an appointment at a Bürgeramt](https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/120926/). I was required to get one within three months of starting and the only available appointment was two months, three weeks out and in a remote location across the city. It took a few tries on the appointment site to get even that and half a day of my time to get the actual Führungszeugnis.

The Bürgeramt is also where you register your address (which you need to sign a lease, get a phone contract, open a bank account, etc), so probably it""s a good idea to [make that appointment](https://service.berlin.de/terminvereinbarung/) as soon as possible to be sure you can go as shortly after you arrive as possible anyway.

137,"&gt;This is partially due to an overemphasis on girls in the K-12 school system

This is not true. It is because [girls perform better academically](http://www.hepi.ac.uk/2016/05/12/new-hepi-report-reveals-educational-underachievement-young-men-higher-education-calls-sector-tackle-problem/). There reasons for this are not 100% clear, but [research by MIT, Northwestern and the University of Florida](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/01/28/the-serious-reason-boys-do-worse-than-girls/) found that a major factor was that children from houses with resources had a small gender gap, but the more disadvantaged children get, the worse the boys do. Connected studies found that they are more sensitive to family stress and that the worse a school is, the worse a boy does in it relative to girls.

Is this due to cultural pressures against academic success for boys? Is it because of discipline processes? Is it because of more ""distractions"" for boys? Is it something in the teaching style of bad schools that girls respond to better than boys that isn't present in better schools? That is not entirely clear, but there was no observed ""pushing"" girl ahead.  

Also impacting statistics, boys are more likely to choose careers that don't require university than girls (most trades for example). 

Another sign that girls' success is not due to special efforts for girls is that this gender imbalance at universities is a global phenomena, even in cultures where boys are significantly more privileged than girls and where they attend gender segregated schools, with significantly more good boys options. Even in [Saudi Arabia](http://english.alarabiya.net/en/perspective/features/2015/05/28/More-women-than-men-in-Saudi-universities-says-ministry.html) more women go to university than men. 

&gt;and partially due to special programs for girls in college. 

What programs exactly? I am not aware of special girls' programs, and as the original article mentions and some other posters say, most countries, including the US and China, are biased in favor of boys admissions to keep the gender ratio somewhat balanced. Or do you mean to encourage girls into STEM? Because even with that, [they are a small percentage of women and many deterrents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_STEM_fields#Explanations_for_low_representation_of_women)  (as a woman in STEM, I am familiar with them, and if you are genuinely curious I can tell you about my personal observations).",2016-09-27 13:39:47+00:00,d842ic7,2.0,t1_d83vc4n,19716.0,todayilearned

139,"[It is hard to say](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2014-09-19/how-many-rape-reports-are-false).

Estimates of the percentage of rape accusations that are false range from 2% (feminists), to 8% (FBI) to 41% (men's rights). Some studies say it happens less than other false accusations of crime, some say the same amount, some say more.

There are no good, reliable statistics that track this because the way that a ""false"" accusation is determined varies significantly by study and by jurisdiction and can't account for things like honest accusers who withdrew their claims or had them dismissed  because of social pressure, bad policing, lack of belief in their stories, etcetera or people who were innocent but were convicted so are counted as guilty. It also can't account for people who were raped but never reported it to the police (another highly uncertain and contentious number that varies significantly by jurisdiction), thereby skewing percentages of false reports by making them just among known rapes instead of all rapes.

Based on what is out there, I would estimate that isn't a serious problem the way that the ""men's rights"" groups claim, or as some of the hysteria would suggest. However, it does happen some of the time is most certainly a problem for the people who are caught up in it, not the least because a falsely accused rapist is followed by that accusation (or conviction) their whole life in a way that someone accused of a non-sexual crime is not.

140,"If you spend your whole life having others take care of things for you, make decisions for you, having the capability to do it yourself isn't fully there. The outside world and its systems are opaque and scary. Much like math or running, critical thinking and independence are things that must be practiced to get stronger. You not only think you can't do it, you probably can't do it. If you can't do it, then the best thing for you is a caring guardian. No one thinks children should be legally independent and it's not an entirely different approach to adult women. 

Simple example:
An Afghan (yes I know not Saudi but also a situation when an adult woman was raised not making decisions) family I know moved to the US. The wife got married at 16, because her grades were slipping and her parents were afraid it was a sign she might do something rebellious, thereby truly ruining her reputation and all future chances in life, so hurriedly found her a husband ten years older to ""steady"" her. She spent her whole life not making a decision, and now she really can't. 

She fears to, and lacks the analytical skills to do so herself. Her husband travels a lot and wants to leave things in her hands while he is gone, but she is overwhelmed when she has to call a repairman, deal with her children's school, etcetera. She doesn't even like to drive to new locations alone in case the GPS and her phone fail and she gets lost and can't get home. Her husband leaves her pre-signed checks to fill in the amount for any bills that arrive and she calls him for advance and direction on everything else.

Their children are completely different, raised to have far more agency.  However, when they first arrived they were heading that way as well. I saw an example of this when I took their eleven year-old daughter to the store to get a party dress (her mother didn't think she could handle a US department store and at the time, she probably couldn't). 

The daughter was unable to say what she liked so I took everything that looked suitable to the occasion that might fit and to try. Three fit well, so I asked which she preferred.

She couldn't tell me. She had a preference, I was sure, but she was so uncertain what would be the right dress for this new country that she just couldn't, couldn't couldn't tell me which she liked, even after I assured they are all a good and appropriate choice of similar price. 

So I got out my phone to occupy myself, sat down in the corner and told her I had all afternoon and to take her time. She agonized and agonized and agonized and asked me to please just tell which one to get. She had a very hard time trusting her own judgement. Finally, she picked the purple one. On the drive home, she told me purple was the color she likes best, so she always had that favorite.

Now she is completely different. She and her sister have opinions, life skills, could be snotty teenagers even. Because she's practiced thinking that way and doing things that require her to think that way. 

Also, because if she makes a wrong decision, the power of reputation  in the USA isn't so strong that it forever ruins her life and that of her relatives. You can do some pretty dumb things and still get an education, job and spouse. If you ""mend your ways,"" that can also be accepted.  In places like Afghanistan or Saudi, a wrong step can be pretty catastrophic for both the transgressor and their relatives, so people are afraid to take small steps or push too hard in case they get it wrong.  I'm pretty tough, but there's a lot I would put up with if I knew rebelling against it would hurt my sister too. ",2016-09-26 19:25:14+00:00,d831l9y,3.0,t1_d82pig3,15254.0,worldnews

Your girlfriend isn't unhappy that you don't worry enough in general. She is worried that you don't appear to be taking your financial situation seriously at a time when she understandably feels that it is serious. 

If taking a trip sends you into overdraft and buying a car is a significant step, you aren't guaranteed to be fine forever. When you show no concern and say that you ""know we'll be fine,"" that is signaling to her that you aren't being serious about your financial situation. 

If you aren't being serious, she can't count on you to be responsible and pull your full share of the weight of effort needed to get to actual stability. So now she is unhappy about your financial situation, but also that she feels that she has to shoulder all of the stress and responsibility, and, equally importantly, that you don't value her opinion and analysis well enough to incorporate it into your own worldview.

Then take steps to show her how serious you are. Make a budget and a plan for the future, and stick to it. When she gets worried you can say things like ""yes, you are right that this is worrying, but we are making progress and I have faith that, together, we can overcome future challenges.""

I like this idea very much. However, there are two things that make it seem impossible to me:

1. The Dulles Toll Road (DTR) was built by VDOT on land leased from the Metropolitan Airport Authority (MWAA).      Initially the idea was just to charge until the cost of construction was finished, but that happened years ago and despite meeting that goal and the land being no one is willing to stop charging to use it and that case has a lot more state involvement already.  The Greenway part would be an even bigger challenge.

2. The Greenway was built on private land by a private company, owned by the Bryant/Crane Family LLC, the Franklin L. Haney Co., and Kellogg Brown &amp; Root (KB&amp;R). These are some serious people with a reach of billions. Going against their interests would be even harder. If they were afraid of a political reaction, they wouldn't be charging quite so much.

So, if there is a brave politician out there willing to help their region and do such things, I would be impressed and happy. I am not optimistic however.

Don't believe me? Try some basic math. In case you were wondering, the average life expectancy of Saudi women is 76, 2.8 years longer than that of Saudi men. If 20% were killed before age 20, the average life expectancy would be significantly lower than the male population that escaped such honor killings. If 20% were killed at age 20 (not by 20), the rest would have to be live almost 20 years longer than the men, past 90, to keep that average life expectancy.  And that is in famously conservative Saudi Arabia, where one might expect the highest rates of honor killings if they were in fact based on Muslim woman-hate.

They don't allow families because they don't want to deal with them. Laborers are low-paid and live in basic communal/shared housing that is often quite uncomfortable. They go to work and back and not much else. If families came, they would want better housing, individual housing, schooling for the children (public school is only for citizens  foreigners send their kids to private schools), public services, more time off, etcetera. Behavior would also have to be policed a lot more. 
They also are less flexible employees. They can't be brought on and off jobs or event sent home as needed. Basically, they cost too much for employers looking mostly for the absolute bottom labor costs. 

On the side of laborers' families, they can't come anyway because they can't afford airfare (laborers often go into debt to cover the cost of their own transport, but even if the employer paid, they wouldn't pay for so many extra people to follow one very low-cost worker) and they know conditions are terrible. They also couldn't afford to live once they got there. The salaries are so low, even when paid as promised, that the cost of living would be too high. However, at home where things are much cheaper, they can live more comfortably, give send children to school, take care of relatives, etcetera.

First step is to research the requirements for visas (most countries have websites on their residence permits with requirements and processes).

Although there are some visas for people with specific skills, without a degree and existing work experience, Europe tends to not recognize someone like that as skilled so you will have a hard time qualifying for one. 

It is likely that you will need a local job offer at a certain income level to get that long-term residency permit and that will be hard to get as a non-skilled foreigner who doesn't speak Serbo-Croatian. 

There are ESL opportunities that you can research but in Croatia most will want a university degree.

Please be aware the Croatia is not a Western European country where all of the adults have been learning excellent English since childhood. Most people don't speak it very well. 

I also wonder why you are so set in long long-term in a place you've never been to, don't seem to know much about or have done the preliminary googling on, and don't speak the language. If you absolutely can't travel there first, serious research into your destinations of interest is a must. I just did a quick google and there are many site to start with this. 

I feel bad writing what seems like such a negative post, moving is possible. However, it requires real research and effort by you, and likely steps to improve your qualifications first. 

My advice is to finish that degree, get a year or two working experience. You will be a much stronger candidate then.

Get a good quality wool coat for winter that at least goes past your hips and ideally to below your knees.

With a good coat, scarf and hat and gloves as needed, walking around in the Russian winter can be quite nice and not as scary as it is sometimes described. Oh, and get some shoes that won't leak in the snow, ideally warm ones that go to the ankle. If you live somewhere so warm these things may be hard to get, and you can buy them in Russia, but they may be cheaper at home.

Russia sometimes has a reputation among foreigners for being rude. Russians are not rude. Many Russians are not as expressive, particularly with strangers, as people are in some other cultures, which foreigners unused to that interpret as rude, especially if they don't speak Russian so go by inflection alone. This doesn't mean they are trying to be rude though, it's just a culturally different way of speaking, so please don't take offense. Once people get to know you, Russian culture can be very generous, outgoing and friendly. Just try your best to be nice yourself and get to know people and you can have a great time. 

Russia is very diverse. By all means, go see Moscow and Petersburg and the Golden Ring cities, but try to see some other parts of the country if you can.  There is spectacular nature as well.

I also like Schnur and Leningrad (although their classic song and video ""Money"" on corruption is perhaps my favorite. Or ""Dikii Muzhina"" which is just fun).

It is precisely because I love Russia and have so many ties there that I know the government there so well, and dislike it so much. Those self interested kleptocrats set up a system that keeps them in power at the expense of what could be a truly great country. The last thing I or any non-oligarchs should want is for them to spread their influence and their system.

(And please don't say ""oh but America is corrupt too!
It is. There are real problems there. But nothing anything like Russia. Obama's daughters aren't billionaires getting billion-dollar government contracts and prestigious government jobs in fields where they aren't experts. So much isn't stolen from highway construction that it would have been cheaper to pave them in Louis Vuitton bags or caviar. Such cheap materials aren't used that they need to be repaved twice as often. Teachers aren't paid so low that parents must give them additional funds/tuition/bribes.  Terrible Congress is terrible because it's obstructs other parties, not because it is entirely controlled by one set of interests who use it to pass laws to control society and oppose reforms. No one gets 146% of the vote. A successful business doesn't have to worry that someone more powerful will just take it over. The IRS doesn't help steal 130 million dollars from the government itself, kill the lawyer who discovered it, and then refuse to let orphans go to living homes as ""punishment"" for those robbing killers being banned from going to another country. Virtually everyone in the country has running water in their homes, even in poor country towns. Etcetera). ",2016-08-18 07:23:41+00:00,d6mburo,4.0,t1_d6lthon,32052.0,politics
273,"I read an interesting study looking at conspiracy theories and the control of information. 

In authoritarian societies where information is controlled and the official bodies really are lying to people (or where people just think that they are, a la certain sections of the US right wing these days) conspiracy theories are far more popular, because the threshold for reasonable belief is gone and replaced with ""whatever authorities say is probably not true and probably masking something worse or in their interests against mine.""

A different set of studies found that the more fearful or threatened a person feels, the more likely they are to believe in conspiracy theories. In this situation, the theory is that they are trying to ""see"" the worst situation in order to protect themselves from it. This works great when you are alone in the woods and think every shadow is a bear, because you don't face negative consequence if it isn't a bear, but you die if you don't take the one real bear shadow seriously. It works less well in modern society.

274,"I don't.

I just don't feel bad about it. If anything, I feel good about it. I''m helping Berlin develop and grow - both directly in it's economy  and society and also in it's culture and lifestyle to attract more people who will do the same.

My husband and I moved to this city, bringing our much-needed capabilities in an area where global needs way outstrip supply and where Berlin is lagging behind other European capitals.

A German company thought it was important enough to pay me an internationally competitive rate for me to choose them, and Berlin. I'm not just here to do my personal work, I'm here to bring my practices and capabilities and spread them here.

We are law-abiding, have our sh*t together and don't break things or mess them up. We also aren't super-agro *ssholes who feel the need to police their neighbors or freak out if we are reminded that we actually live in a metropolitan area where other people also live.

We are active in the city and the community, I volunteer and am involved in art projects as my hobby, my husband is a serious techno lover and quite involved in the techno scene (FYI, if you actually know the DJs and love them enough to go to Berghain enough times the bouncers start recognizing you, getting in isn't _that_ hard anymore, even if you aren't wearing all black. The one problem is the line, and *ssholes who think they deserve to cut, and I think general Berlin acceptance of inefficiency and poor customer service is part of that. Major clubs in other cities also have lines to show exclusivity, but not hours-long lines).

I speak German, my husband is diligently learning and making good progress. 

So yeah, we came, with our social engagement and good income from having desperately needed skills. We also came to pay our tremendously high tax rate and make zero demands on government services. We are precisely the kind of person that most cities do their best to attract.

I don't care if that bothers people who would rather a city stay poor and lag behind the rest of the country and the world as long as they can have a nice apartment in an in-demand neighborhood based on their income from a low-skilled job or working 15 hours a week. 

I have sympathy for older people who want to stay where they have always lived, and think that government regulation and programs to help them are a good thing. I also think it's pretty clear that Berlin public schools are not good and need significant improvements in _all_ districts, so that families don't feel forced to pay to stay in very small areas.  I don't care at all if some entitled guy thinks that the the rules of housing Berlin should be different from every other city in the world just because he really wants a cheap apartment in a few particular neighborhoods.",2016-08-17 20:16:01+00:00,d6ln6bw,4.0,t1_d6k4g36,88803.0,berlin

276,"The money thing was key, at least in our situation.

Moving to Berlin, we had no credit history for a Schufa, no German bank account and no way of verifying existing income from international contracts was real. We were still abroad and couldn't do apartment visits in person.

But, we had money! This put us in the upper rent range, lowering the competition, but also gave us resources in addition to monthly income. So I offered to pay six months rent in advance to make up for the risk of taking us. It turns out that the law prefers monthly payment and caps a Kaution at three months, so that is what we did, but making that offer was extremely helpful and made us look like fiscally reliable tenants who could and would pay their bills. After verifying that all accounts and ownership were real and legitimate, I sent the Kaution via wire transfer just before leaving for Berlin.

That extra display of financial stability made getting an amazing apartment was very easy. I didn't even know how hard it could be until we got here and the owners told us about the many other offers they received, and then I started reading about even crazier cases in the lower rent ranges.

I realize that this was not difficult for us to do because we did have resources that not everyone has, but perhaps additional Kaution offers and other displays of financial stability (savings?) beyond just the monthly paycheck can help push an applicant to the top of the pile in other cases as well. 

I know I look for the most reliable and not the richest when looking for tenants for my apartment. I want someone who won't trash the place and will always pay on time, not someone who could pay on time if they weren't strapped for cash after spending it on other things.",2016-08-17 19:53:26+00:00,d6lm0yn,1.0,t3_4y13g1,90740.0,berlin

This isn't always 100% true - PoR and Yanukovych had their original base in E. Ukrainian and primary loyalties to their ~~mafia~~ business supporters there, but when it came to foreign policy this is definitely the case.

PoR even signed an official collaboration agreement with United Russia, the ruling a party of Russia that is unofficially directed by Putin much as Party of Regions was by Yanukovych. 

Perhaps the most visible case of Yanukovych and PoR doing what Russia told them against what an actually domestically-looking president would do was what sparked the Maidan protests and Yanukovych and PoR being thrown out of power. 

Popular opinion was very much in favor of signing an ascension agreement with the EU. Many hopes were somewhat unreasonable - this one agreement wasn't going to make Ukraine a Western, well-functioning member of the European Union - but it was at least a small step in that direction and highly popular.  Many of Ukraine's ~~oligarchs~~ business interests were also in favor of going in this direction, as in Russia access to wealth is controlled by existing power structures and it is never secure if you fail to ingratiate or someone more powerful wants your assets (Ukrainian corrupt business is a bit more multipolar, aren't as strong as the biggest Russian interests and the ones who already had their money were more interested in keeping it than helping other steal some more). 

Yanukovych knew this. He knew that everything that could be considered a legal or de facto constituency wanted this EU ascension agreement. So he agreed to sign it. 

Russia did not want this agreement signed. They have tried for some time to develop an alternative Eurasian union, and in general are concerned about loss of regional influence and encirclement by blocks that it reasonably perceives as hostile to the Russian government and it's interests. 

So they pressured Yanukovych to sign with them instead. Officially, they offered 15 billion USD in ""loans."" They also offered support in upcoming elections that the unpopular Yanukovych would have a hard time winning legitimately.

He took that deal, went against what practically everyone in the country wanted, and sparked the Maidan protests.  Once they started, he received support and advice from Russia. The true facts of the violence in the protests are very murky and there were violent actors on both sides, but Russia is also accused of sending assistance in the crackdown.

PS This isn't even the first time Russia supported Yanukovych as his people kicked him out. He was actually kicked out by protesters _twice._ The first time was in 2005, after he tried to take power in highly fraudulent elections and a very mysterious attempted assassination-by-poisoning of his rival Yuschenko. Russia supported him strongly in his efforts to stay in power that time as well, because they expected that he would be the client he turned out to be when he was in power.",2016-08-17 17:53:13+00:00,d6lfqn9,2.0,t1_d6l5z8x,11582.0,politics

More than $100,000 is supplies alone (minus any paid labor, packing or shipping costs, and minus lost profitable business forgone to process this order) were sent in record time and at cost to help Katrina victims. Everyone felt pretty good and glad they could help.

The truck drove as far as it could to the appointed delivery center, but eventually was stopped in Louisiana at a road block. Outside vehicles could go no further. 

No problem though, there was a Red Cross staging ground there for just such purposes. They accepted and signed for delivery and our family friend thought everything was fine.

Until the Red Cross attempted to not pay at all, and then argued that they didn't have to pay the entire amount, because the delivery was not made to the address initially provided. The address that the Red Cross knew was inaccessible and for which they had set up alternative delivery points. No one claimed that the goods weren't delivered in time or were somehow defective, just that since the Red Cross representative that took delivery was located in a different point than a legally and physically inaccessible delivery point, they shouldn't have to pay for what they accepted and used.

In the end they paid, but it cost our friend's small business a few thousand dollars in legal fees to conduct the right correspondence to convince the Red Cross that it wasn't worth the fight.

The Red Cross can be helpful in international disasters, if only because they are so big and high profile they can play key large-scale roles, but thanks to their bad faith dealings in the US they are on at least one company's very short black list. If I wanted to engage or help in that country, I would look elsewhere. There are too many other options. ",2016-08-16 06:22:01+00:00,d6je2f2,5.0,t1_d6iw850,29794.0,personalfinance

However, before you decide even that, I have to ask - have you been to Iceland? Or any of the Scandinavian countries? Have you been there in winter? Do you understand the culture, the job markets? There is a lot of idealization of the region on this sub, but I notice that much of it comes from people who have never been there for more than a brief tourist stop, if that. They are real countries, with real cultures and challenges of their own - not just a utopian reaction against what you don't like in the US or elsewhere. 

I personally find a lot to admire, but also found that the culture is insular and not that outgoing, so making friends is very hard, and that it can be quite boring at times, so much so that everyone I know who moved there (OK, all four of them), left after a few years. The only one who felt happy there was a semi-pro football player on the side, and credited his very multinational team with being his friends and making him welcome. He still applied for jobs elsewhere, and took one - he wanted to live somewhere interesting.

In 2014 (2015 numbers aren't published yet, sorry), [more than 32,000 people died from terrorism](http://economicsandpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Global-Terrorism-Index-2015.pdf), with about half of those victims from ISIS in the Middle East and Boko Haram in Africa. 

[The World Health organization predicts](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs266/en/) that, starting in 2030, climate change will directly kill 250,000 people per year through malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress. This does not include anyone who dies from natural disasters, flooding, relocation stresses (e.g. farmers lose their land, move to slums, now face all risks of slum dwellers), increased spread of diseases, etcetera. 

Already more people are dying from climate change than terrorism. For example, the 2003 heat wave in Europe (a place with generally good record keeping, so a good place to check for such things), [more than 70,000 excess deaths were recorded](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs266/en/).

That information couldn't have come from Seth - he was dead by then. 

It came from someone who said they were a Romanian hacktivist named Guccifer 2.0, a reference to an actual Romanian hacktivist who used the handle Guccifer. 

[""Gufficer 2.0""](https://guccifer2.wordpress.com/2016/06/30/faq/) first appeared after the DNC accused Russia of being behind that hacks.  He claimed to be Romanian, but [couldn't speak Romanian very well, and made English mistakes consistent with those that would be made by a native Russian speaker](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/why-does-dnc-hacker-guccifer-20-talk-like-this). 

He released files from the DNC [with Russian-language notes and errors and using the names of famous communist leaders, including the creator of what became the KGB](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/guccifer-20-is-likely-a-russian-government-attempt-to-cover-up-their-own-hack) - something that a Romanian, who would speak a Romance language and not be too in love with Soviet Communism, would be unlikely to do.

Two weeks after Seth's death, at the end of July, ""Guccifer 2.0"" was still active,  emailing parts of what would later be posted by Wikileaks to journalists trying to get them to publish. Most didn't want to, since by then he was accepted by most to be a Russian state actor. Interestingly, he was doing this from Russian resources as well, specifically using [a VPN service popular in Russia and available only in Russian](https://www.threatconnect.com/guccifer-2-all-roads-lead-russia/).

It was only after that didn't work that the decision was used to use Wikileaks.

Or I should file additional reports on the car robberies and fire bombing in addition to what those cars owners filed, and that the fire and police responders filed in the case of the car firebombing?

Even the fact that there are fire bombings of multiple cars and a bus, that the so-called activists think they can safely do this as a way to put pressure on police to leave them alone, speaks to how much I can expect the police to respond to such issues. 

If they don't take a firebombing campaign stemming from a well-known group of people seriously enough to stop it, then what hope do I have that they will start protecting me from reckless drivers and selfish learners? Or that the city department responsible for fixing the bike paths will actually do it? 

I don't see the value in that, and somehow suggesting that all the police need to finally start acting on such matters is one more report from me seems unrealistic.

In addition to individual registration by religion, the Nazis demanded proof of non-Jewish ancestry.  That meant that, while you might be a converted Catholic or Protestant and registered as such, but if your parents or grandparents were born Jewish, then you could still have problems.

An easy way to confirm this was their registrations, but also the church practice of recording life events. If you couldn't produce baptism, confirmation and marriage documents from a church for every grandparent and parent (and further back for some positions), you could still be considered Jewish enough to be persecuted, even if you personally were registered as a Christian.

In smaller towns and villages, being known to be Jewish or of Jewish heritage by other locals could also be enough, particularly in occupied territories. Belarusian Jewish villagers weren't given a chance to 
produce documents prior to being herded en masse to mass shooting sites, for example. 

There was one weird option for a small number of people however, particularly those who happened to look more of what the Nazis thought an aryan should look like. In some cases, one could try and apply to be ""aryanized."" This involved some falsification of history, such as a sworn statement that a woman had cheated on her Jewish husband with an Aryan ""real"" father of her children.

399,"This isn't wholly true. The Saudi government has very real problems and concerns about conservative citizens who support violence, and even more about those who are peaceful and law abiding now, but who are themselves so conservative they resist efforts by the government to liberalize or reform and could pose a future threat if there were too unhappy.  

One King, Faisel, was even assassinated in revenge for the death of such a rebel. In that case, the killer wanted to avenge the death of his brother who had died attacking  a TV station because he was so unhappy about its existence and Faisal's efforts to generally open up the country. His brothers who have ruled since his death remember this.

Part of this conservatism is the governments fault - it tried to win legitimacy and discredit democracy, Pan-Arabism and even Pan-Islamism by arguing that they were the most religiously pure and everyone else was in some way degraded. The school system reenforces this as well.  Part of it comes from within - because of this legitimacy effort, religious leaders were the one sort of alternative power structures that couldn't be too cracked down on and that themselves were good at attracting the most people. Part of it was semi-external (for example, the large US presence in Saudi Arabia in Gulf War I was welcomed by the leadership who wanted defense from Iraq, but hated by the conservative parts of the population who thought staying religiously pure was more important. Globalization is another perceived threat but also something that allows extreme groups to link up).

The government under the last king was trying through baby steps to open the population to more ideas (the more cut off areas like central Riyadh are generally more conservative than the more linked areas like coastal Jeddah), doing things like massively increasing scholarships abroad and creating closed research cities where the rules are more relaxed and which can hopefully be used to show the rest of the country that such reforms are possible without catastrophe. The new Kings seems a bit more focused on consolidating power but he hadn't ended his predecessors' programs.  More educated groups of society also have their own movements and efforts, particularly to end women's guardianship laws (essentially you're never a legal adult if you're a woman).

Something has to be done because the government does support the population in return for support, but it isn't Dubai where that population is only ten percent of all residents. The government can't just buy them off. There are a lot of Saudis, including poor Saudis, and the education system hasn't helped with employment. The oil price is very low now as well.

400,"This sounds less like an adoption and more like a charitable support of the mother.   It would be an extremely kind, generous and self-sacrificing thing for the older couple to do, but that wouldn't be adoption. 

As an adoption-type scenario, this sounds like a nightmarish situation for the couple wanting their own family, the birth mother and the child. 

At some point, someone would be torn away from someone that they viewed as family. Even if the birth mother lived with the couple for at least as long as the child is in the house (so at least 18 years - quite a serious commitment), there would still be real problems between the adoptive parents and the birth moth regarding their relationship to the child and who was the ""primary"" parent. There is also no good legal way to give the adoptive parents rights as adoptive parents if the birth mother remains a legal mother - there will always be that risk of loss and insecurity in the relationship. 

As a foster parent of a pregnant teenager, or member of a charity supporting mothers in difficult situations, I could see how this would be a good thing.

This is really grasping at conspiracy theory straws. 

Biggest problem: ""Assange claimed.""

No actual documents or proof were leaked. And Assange has shown himself willing to leak anything he can get. 

It is also extremely unlikely:

The secretary of state can not and does not hold positions at companies, let alone foreign ones, let alone get paid by them. It's a pretty obvious rule.

Before you say ""but..but.. Hillary lies and breaks rules!"" consider how impossible it would be to hide such a position. Consider how easy it would be to attack her for it. Consider how much she would risk - secretary of state job, US presidential race chances - for 100K, at a time when she and her husband already have millions.

Even if she were a director at Lafarge, which she was not, and which no leaked anything shows she was, being a director there does not make you arming ISIS.

423," I lived in Saudi as a child and have visited since as an adult. 

I know all about how KSA (and other Gulf countries such as the UAE and Oman) treat workers. 

It is shameful.

The fact that the US feels that it has to to be friendly with such governments is dirty politics, and I would be happy to support any candidate that saw an effective way out of it.

However, Trump is not really calling for an end to alliances in the Middle East, nor has he made any effort to help workers there. 

In fact, he is directly benefiting and using that abused, near-slave underclass of workers. [Trump workers in Dubai are just as abused and live in squalid conditions](http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/vice-on-hbo-dubai-workers-trump-international-golf-club). According the report to which I linked, they live in worse conditions than even many other abused Gulf workers. 

[Even within the US, Trump's own contractors complain that he didn't pay them in the United States where the legal protections are much stronger, in some cases destroying their businesses as a result of his unpaid debts](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/09/donald-trump-unpaid-bills-republican-president-laswuits/85297274/). 

Trump is not ""guilty by association"" with the abuse of workers in Gulf countries. He personally engages in it and grows richer from it.

Trump is also happy to do business in Saudi Arabia, and [continues to do so](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-saudi-arabia-911-business-deals-a7038991.html).

However, in the case of Trump and Russia, I am not talking about ""guilt by association"" as you attempt to suggest.

I am talking about guilt by direct and immediate alliance.

He chose to hire a man well known for his deep and direct support of deeply corrupt politicians in Ukraine.

He chose himself to become deeply and personally indebted to the Russian establishment, and to pursue political policies in support of their interests and against America's existing obligations and America's strongest allies. 

That is a bit more than ""guilt by association through the dirty political process."" That is condoning the worst political excess and willfully and directly allying yourself with a foreign power in return for personal enrichment and business success.

PS I'm guessing you didn't know that Trump used abused Gulf workers before trying to depict Hillary Clinton as worse by indirectly connecting her to the practice, or that Trump recently opened businesses in the Saudi city of Jeddah (which, by law, must be co-owned by Saudis and big projects have big co-owners) before suggesting that friendly relations with that country was a sign of Hillary Clinton's failures as compared to Trump.
I found those items with a quick google.  There are likely a lot more out there that can be found with actual time and research. I suggest informing yourself before so blindly committing yourself to a politician (or any cause really). You run a good chance of supporting someone who in the end will hurt you.

I added the post history comment because, given that r/redpill and the related philosophy are known for a lack of logical knowledge and a feeling of grievance and possibly even conspiracy, it is not surprising that your posts here reflect that as well.

As for what you think Hillary Clinton did, some she did (the only true ones are the fact that she and her husband were paid for speeches, and his foundation took donations, in a way that could and probably did cause a conflict of interest), but most she did not. Some of what you said is just raving conspiracies and some of it appears to be a hyperbolic and confused interpretation of her personal polices and those of the Obama Administration. Which you can dislike, but you can't attribute to her personal corruption. Why don't you provide some actual sources?

As for this particular post, I judge you for that lack of facts, and because, despite seeing everything that I wrote, you still misunderstand the basic meaning of my clear, English-language sentences. 

I did not say that the issue is n ""a tenuous connection to illegal shit going on in another country which may or may not have financial ties to Trump.""

I said that the issue is here is direct and clear ties between a man Trump hired to lead his organization's previous job was direct involvement in the direct and serious destruction of a country. That man was a lead advisor to help that lead looter and destroyer get power, keep power (his public, undisputed role was senior political advisor) and hide his stolen goods (as detailed in the original article in this thread, and other media coverage). 

I said that the second issue is that Trump himself, unable to get funding in the US thanks to his bankruptcy, has chosen to rely very heavily on Russian funding to keep his business going, and has publicly supported the ignoring of US international commitments in Europe, something that the Russian leadership, the same people on whom he is financially dependent want very much, but almost no one else in the GOP wants. 

I also judge you because again attempt to ignore fact or understanding of my basic arguments, and instead try to attribute my concern to ""your feels or something, I guess.""

I supplied facts, sources and explanations. My only ""feels"" as you put them (the actual word is feelings FYI, we aren't teenagers making memes and talking down to me won't make any of the facts I presented any less factual) is that massive corruption, beatings, and murder are wrong. Trusting someone to run your organization best known for supporting someone who kept and lost power based on those things is wrong, and selling out your country to finance your struggling business is wrong.

First, Manafort's role in Ukraine and what happened there:

He was a major political advisor to the ousted president Viktor Yanukovych. This man looted his desperately poor country of [100 billion USD](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-yanukovich-idUSBREA3T0K820140430).

He corrupted the political system and ignored popular opinion so much she caused [not one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Revolution) but [two revolutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Ukrainian_revolution)

Yanukovych was not entirely a Russian client. he came up with support from Eastern Ukrainian organized crime, and their interests were not always in line with the Russian government's. However, when he was in trouble in Ukraine, he quickly made deals with Russia and went back on his stated plan to sign an ascension agreement with the EU (something that was so unpopular in Ukraine it sparked the second of the two revolutions that ousted him). 

I do not expect that Trump would entirely be a Russian client, but, like Manafort's previous boss in Ukraine, he [really needs the Russian leadership]([Trump is personally heavily dependent on Russia](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/trump-putin-yes-it-s-really-a-thing) and is already making steps when he said he would [ignore NATO obligations in support of Russian interests](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/22/world/europe/donald-trump-nato-baltics-interpreter.html). 

Selling out an entire country's interests to another for your own is a pretty high level of corruption.  I'm not condoning taking foundation donations and the establishment political process is inherently corrupt, but with all that, at its absolute worst, it is not as bad as what Manafort did once in Ukraine, and his new boos Trump is leaning towards now in America.

447,"All of this seems like grasping at straws to discount a very sad story in which the core facts of the victims or their abuse are not disputed.

As far as your specific efforts to refute the article, they are all flawed:

- In a story that talks about the violation of multiple illegal acts violating multiple laws, the fact that the law on medical insurance and medical care is not fully observed is not reason to question said story. Particularly when the issue in question, inadequate medical care for workers, is well documented on multiple occasions.

- Your opinion about poor writing is not actually cause to discount the facts of the abuse described.  Really, the writing is fine. It isn't the most beautiful prose in the world, but it is fine. Even if it were not, the only way to discount the story of abuse is to somehow prove that the facts and reports of abuse are not true, not that you don't like the author's writing style. 

- It is dishonest to claim that the article confuses the entire countries United Arab Emirates and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The article uses the word kingdom to describe the UAE, it doesn't call the UAE Saudi Arabia. While Kingdom is not the most commonly used term to describe the UAE, it isn't wholly inaccurate. Both countries are monarchies. It certainly isn't inaccurate enough to ""call bullshit"" on an article that is not about the political structure of the UAE, but rather reporting of crimes, acts illegal in the UAE, witnessed by the author in the UAE.  

If you want people to think well of the UAE, don't offer flimsy excuses or attempt to use weak strawman arguments to discount what is just one example of well-established, persistent, systemic abuse. Show that you care about such abuse, and are working to stop it. 

Otherwise, you risk looking like what the human rights groups accuse the UAE of being: perfectly fine with the abuse scores of humans in order to fund an even more profitable lifestyle for a privileged group, and only paying what lip service or semantics games are necessary to avoid too much criticism from the rest of the world.",2016-07-19 15:14:55+00:00,d5i7xt4,6.0,t1_d5i74q3,1129.0,UAE

449,"The article is pretty clear that the issue at hand is a very specific one, happening at a very specific place,  Yas Island in the UAE. I don't think there is confusion about that, or which with which workers the author spoke. 

I think the Kingdom versus Emirate issue is more one of lazy English. In the UAE and KSA, it is a clear difference, but to far-away English speakers who don't really differentiate, an emirate (principality) and kingdom are basically the same thing, with unelected hereditary heads and ruling families.  Calling the UAE a kingdom was the wrong word choice, but it isn't so wrong that it invalidates the key facts of the article, and the abuse it reports.

As for jailing contractors, I would take the governments' commitment to worker welfare a lot more seriously if the actions weren't against such a small percentage of the overall industry. For example, this story is public, is anyone in trouble over it? The norm seems to be nice sounding laws (like the decree last January), but unenforcement, low fines if enforced at all, punishments for workers rights advocates, and ongoing abuse that is the norm, not the exception.  

The only thing special about the works on Yas Island is that it is happening to them for the first time.  Such abuses have been going on for years - more than enough time to crack down on them - and yet, they are still going on.",2016-07-19 11:37:14+00:00,d5i0ktc,4.0,t1_d5i0b3g,750.0,UAE
450,"&gt; Most of these issues are illegal in UAE

Yet they still happen, and are happening, over and over again. The case in this article is happening right now. After so many years of such well-known abuses, the fact that it still exists on this scale suggests that the government knows about the situation, doesn't care and will not be enforcing the laws in any meaningful way for the foreseeable future. The fact that workers's rights advocates are arrested and journalists seeking to cover their abuses are obstructed only reenforces this view. 

Why? Enforcement is essentially non-existent and even if the laws are enforced the punishments are very low fines (relative to the money made).

&gt; Recruiters are not allowed to charge a fee to the workers -

Another commonly broken law. It doesn't matter how good a law is if consequence-free violations are the norm.

&gt; if the recruiter promised them more, he was lying to them (presumably to extract a bigger bribe). It's an old confidence trick and it is sad this worker fell for it. Again, this is a matter for police in their home countries.

Not if he has a contract for work in the UAE. Then it is also a matter for the UAE. In this case, the firm that hired him had been contracted by Canadian company Ellisdon on behalf of Aldar Properties, a real estate development company with headquarters in Abu Dhabi.  Aldar is legally responsible for the work they contracted.  

(I'd also be a lot more willing to believe protestations of ignorance and innocence by the UAE-based company if this exact scam didn't happen so often it appears to be the norm, not the exception).

&gt; The 6 month probation period is standard practice for almost all expat contracts, whether they are labourers or managing directors. If you leave before the end of the probation period, you are liable for your relocation costs. That is the normal clause and if he agreed to it in the contract, there is not much he can do about that.

If he weren't trapped in what is essentially illegal debt bondage, and were getting paid what he was promised, then this would not be an issue. As it he is, this section of the law is just another way of controlling the workers. 

&gt; With regards to cleanliness, the men are responsible for keeping their own living quarters clean workers tidy.

I agree that in housing of a livable standard, further cleanliness is the responsibility of the residents. However, in the case of the construction workers, the housing is not of a livable standard, and is instead of a type that it is impossible to keep clean.

I have seen multiple reports on multiple construction companies complaining about access to enough washing, bathroom, and cooking facilities, overcrowding, uncomfortable locations, and other problems that lead to unavoidably dirty conditions.  This also seems to be a norm.

In the case of the workers in the article, they live in rooms crammed with bunk beds, eight men share one toilet and one tiny, dirty kitchen with only basic gas stoves. 

The article also mentions that there often isn't even time for the workers to use these facilities, let alone maintain them.  The bus for Yas Island leaves at 6am and they work long hours. 

Workers housing always needs some dedicated maintenance and support staff, but in this case it sounds like the workers don't even have the time (or the energy, after working all day in the summer), to do some work themselves.",2016-07-19 11:30:50+00:00,d5i0fv6,2.0,t1_d5i01x9,1111.0,UAE

&gt;They also keep women uneducated

This is more accurate. Women are only [13% of the work force](http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2015/02/10/Women-constitute-13-of-Saudi-workforce-stats-agency.html), as compared to [47% in the United States](https://www.dol.gov/wb/factsheets/qf-laborforce-10.htm).

&gt;and with very little societal power. 

This is semi true, but not in the way that you assume. Among other women, and among families, women have social influence.  

The problem is family reputation. This is an issue for everyone seeking any type of change in Saudi Arabia. Your reputation isn't just yours, it is tied to your family.  If someone steps out of of a socially acceptable way, then they are viewed negatively by the society around them, but their family is as well (for raising/supporting/possibly spreading such activity).  

When another relative wants to get married, or get a job, or be invited to one of the large social gatherings (wedding can have a thousand guests, which also shows you how far a bad reputation can travel), they may not be welcome, because the person doing the inviting will be afraid that this bad example/enabler type person might also be a problem, or spread a problem that could threaten them or their relatives and lead them to a way that could threaten their reputation, and their well-being, or simply cause them and their loved ones to be associated with the behavior in question, thereby hurting their chances. 

As in every society, but even more so in Saudi Arabia, women have the strongest pressures on them regarding reputation, and the strongest consequences for ""losing"" that reputation.  That in turn makes the pressure on women even greater.

A related interesting issue was posted in this sub a few weeks ago.  Saudi is a collectivist society, and in such places (as compared to Western individualism), social norms are rules are considered protecting and preserving. [Therefore, when a person has a bad consequence, that is perceived more due to their violating of those rules and less because of others' negative actions against them](http://www.balancingjane.com/2012/02/individualism-v-collectivism-victim.html). If breaking the social rules, gets you trouble, then better not break them to stay safe. 

Another issue is the fact that, in the cases of women who grow up never being truly self reliant or making their own decisions, there hits a point where doing so become very difficult. It becomes even more difficult than that if, when they do try, they aren't taken as seriously as a man would be. Men and women see these women and think that they really can't do it on their own, they really do need support and protection, and, well, guarding.

I used to live in Saudi, as a Westerner. I never had to cover up as much as Saudi women (I mostly just wore an open abaya over jeans or a long skirt and a regular top that didn't show too much cleavage). However, I felt better wearing what I wore because it really did decrease (although not stop) the sexual harassment and unwanted attention.  The assumption is that, since women who break the appearance norms are harassed, only a women who wants such attention would  do it, and are already a ""bad"" girl who, by breaking those rues, kind of has it coming.

459,"OvidPerl  addressed your misunderstandings very well regarding the tax risks, but there are other things to consider.

Many banks won't even give US citizens accounts. The reporting requirements to help the US catch potential tax dodgers just isn't worth the hassle to them. This extends to other services like mortgages as well. 

Companies that employ Americans should report back to the US too. That has costs and hassle. What is more, certain benefits (like tuition in countries where there is no public school for non-national children) are considered taxable by the US, essentially making Americans more expensive to hire. Foreign companies in foreign companies don't want to pay to handle all of these extra issues, or worry about the consequences for getting something wrong, so Americans are not desirable as employees and frequently lose out to competition from other countries. 

It has a real effect worldwide. I personally witnessed the American population in Dubai melt to a small shadow of its former self once these laws started. Companies just didn't want to hire the American applicants at the rates they did before, not where there are comparable applicants from other Western countries who are easier, safer and cheaper.  

Reporting concerns makes working with Americans companies or entrepreneurs also less attractive. 

Non-US spouses have to file in the US too in order to prove that the US spouse isn't hiding income with them. Not only is it a privacy and sovereignty issue (since when does France get to demand to see the personal financial data of an American citizen living in China?), this is hard for people to do and paying to have all that done and filed has a cost. 

There are many ways in which this tax rule hurts Americans even if they aren't actually paying any more in tax.

In fact, the countries in this article in which the embassies are restricting access are all countries with higher tax rates than the United States, and all have tax treaties with the US to avoid double taxation. Even actual millionaires would not pay much (if anything) to the US after paying to their countries of residence.

The visible percentage is not quite so high though because the many constructor workers, of which they are the majority, live in camps and it is hard for them to mingle with the rest of the population.

The worker situation is a disgrace. There are laws that seem OK, but little enforcement and even if they were enforced, the penalties are so low that they mean nothing to be people who must pay them. Organizations that Rey to help the workers get the protections to which they are entitled by UAE are harassed by the authorities and sometimes face legal action themselves.

The services for everyone else are very minimal - foreigners must pay for their own schools, health care, always have a job (or be the dependent of someone employed), retirement savings etc. 

As a result, you must live there for at least 25 years to apply for a passport, and I know people who had to sign documents permanently rejecting UAE citizenship in order to have their visa renewed after staying 24 years. 

Dubai wants expats to come, work, grow their economy and go home. The last thing the government wants is people thinking they belong there.  I'm not sure how successful this idea will be in the long run though, at least among groups from poorer countries with less options or attractions home. I know Palestinians and Pakistanis whose parents were born in Dubai even, although none are legal citizens, they show no indication of eve going anywhere.

There is a Kindereir copycat in the US called Yowie Boof that is allowed to be sold because inside they have much larger, solid figurines that are not considered to be of chokeable size.

491,"If he is a billionaire.

He says he is, but he won't publish his taxes (like every other candidate) or have a straightforward discussion about his real assets and income. Things he told Americans made him money (like his Scottish resort), he told others lost him significant amounts (like what he said about the Scottish resort while in Scotland).

Many other projects, such as the airline or the steaks  or his fraudulent ""university,"" failed.

If you doubt his incompetence, just look at his speeches, or the ""issues"" page of his website. There is very little concrete plans or nuanced understanding in his speeches, and his site has little beyond ""loving Israel (also without insight into what that means in a sensitive region), a promise to remain untainted because he is self-funding (which he no longer is), and some defenses of his ""university"" scam. 

Where you look at his words, he is even more incompetent. His tax plan isn't remotely affordable, even in basic math terms (it you make the cuts he promised while not touching the budget areas he promises to preserve there isn't enough money in the budget left). His ""foreign policy"" ideas betray deep ignorance of foreign policy (for example I heard an interview with the Economist in which he didn't know about Chinese efforts to claim contested islands - a very sensitive topic in Asia that has the potential to cause a war). The Mexican wall is another example of a complete disconnect from reality. Mexico can't afford a wall like that, and even if it could, doing so would be such political suicide any leader would accept any penalty short of war rather than do so. Trump saying ""it'll be great,"" without any effort to back that up, only makes me more worried about his lack of understanding or willingness to knowingly flat-out lie.

Not everyone can know everything, which is why even actual expert candidates have experts on their staff. Trump hires people he personally likes or whom he feels are loyal. The number of actual, respected experts on his team is so small I can't think of one truly undisputed expert.  

His willingness to choose support over expertise or even ethics brings him to another problem impacting his ability to rule - his willingness to accept racist and prejudiced groups. That helps him among the most conservative (where they are disproportionate), but is a large part of why so much of the entire country he wants to lead views him so highly negatively. 

It is true that isn't entirely incompetent at everything, however, which is why he has some money. 

He is a very good self marketer. He has licensed his name and his image very successfully. He also inherited a very successful real estate business just when real estate starting increasing in value exponentially.

He is even making money off of his campaign - his donor-funded campaign pays Trump businesses full market value to use their venues, water, etcetera. Those are donations from Trump to his can align - they are business. 

That makes him some money. 

But is he a billionaire? Is he fit to be president?

I see little that suggests yes and much that causes deep concern.

She is a living embodiment of the establishment system that is not serving many Americans or world citizens. I hoped this election could change that system. Instead, I now hope to preserve that system for one more election cycle rather than let the system disintegrate into absolute destruction at the hands of an incompetent, self-interested opportunist. My only real hope left is that this election will scare the establishment while creating opportunities for state and local elections, as well as in four years, and that is a sad hope.

Unless you pop onto the sidewalk to avoid construction in the bike lane, or you inadvertently stand too close in the ATM line, or you call a doctor's office for an appointment without realizing that you need a referral, or you walk around in your own apartment after 10pm, or you need some kind of customer service....

There's a lot of pretty stuffy people very ready to get very angry the second you aren't doing something the way they think you should be. I've lived in eight countries now and been to more than 60 and Berlin is by far the rudest place I've ever lived. I have been to worse, but in daily interactions I don't remember any ruder either. 

But yeah, you won't get too much pressure to conform if you want to grow dreads, or beg on the metro, or set your slackline up in the park...

I'm not saying don't move to Berlin. There are many good things to recommend it. However, don't come here for a truly loving, accepting environment. Certain subcultures are accepted, and there isn't the pressure to ""succeed"" or show material wealth like in some places, but be aware that this that comes with a rudeness so famous that the Google autocomplete options for ""Warum sind Berliner.."" (why are Berliners..."") are ""so unhöflich,"" ""unhöflich"" and ""arrogant"" (so rude, rude and arrogant).   ",2016-06-28 23:02:27+00:00,d4ruofa,3.0,t1_d4rjgt4,15364.0,berlin

When diplomats do really bad things, such as murder or rape, their countries can choose to revoke that immunity and allow them to stand trial. Some countries even do this. Others don't waive it for smaller issues, but require staff to pay traffic fines, obey the laws, etc. even if they technically don't have to.

In the case of the Gulf elites, there is a different problem - people get diplomatic passports without being true diplomats, it is just a royal perk to keep them extra safe and consequence free aa they travel to enjoy the benefits of countries with stronger rule of law systems than their own.

Yes it is bearable. Most of the time anyway (if I were hit by a car it would quickly cease to be bearable).

Yes.

The worst ever was today.  I was in a bike lane. I was even stopped - the light had just turned red.  In the lane to the left of me, a big, orange truck had also stopped. A speeding silver VW, hoping to race across the street before the intersecting lane started, pulled into the bike lane to bypass the truck, misjudged the space, their mirror hit my handlebar going pretty fast, so it spun my bike around and over, with me on it.

The last time I went, my metal egg-filled carryon bag attracted the attention of security in FRA. 

They opened it, I explained, the woman said ""oh how nice"" and I went on my way.

In the US, customs has never once appeared to care at all.

585,"Most people throughout Russia, including the Russian Far East, are white and European-looking. Most of them are ethnic Russians, but there are also other groups, like Ukrainians, Finns, Udmurt (famous for having the highest percentage of redheads in the world), etcetera.

However, Russia has 185+ ethnic groups, plus is the second largest destination for migrants after the United States (the majority of which in Russia coming from Central Asia, so are Persian/Tajiks, Turco-Mongolian or a combination thereof), so there are people throughout the country who are either white, but of a different group, or belong to a different ethnicity. Perhaps best known areas with non white European ethnicities are Tatarstan, Bashkortostan and the Caucasus. The Tatars and Bashkirs are Turkic peoples and the Caucasus are home to several Caucasian ethnicities (not to be confused with European white people - calling white people Caucasian is based in flawed science by a racist researcher who thought that white people must have come from there because of all the human skulls he collected, he thought that the Caucasian ones were the best looking).

Anyway, back to the part of Russia that is in Asia.

The majority of the population is white, European ethnic Russians.  However, there are other groups.  Buryatia is a fairly large region that is home to the Buryat, who are of Mongolian descent. Yakutia is home to the Yakut, a Northeastern group of people of Turkic descent. There are also Russia's many indigenous peoples, such as the Chukchi and the Evenks. There used to be ethnic Koreans there, and there still are some, but many were deported to Central Asia under Stalin and their descendants became citizens of those countries during the breakup of the USSR.

On top of all that, the part of the border shared with China has a lot of Chinese migrants, legal and otherwise, who come for varying periods of time.

He refused to back down in efforts to get everyone to follow the law.  Those corrupt government allies put him in jail and said, just lie and put the blame on a foreigner, and he refused.

They kept him for a year in prison, in a cell without windows in winter, in terrible conditions as his health worsened, but he would not renounce what he, as a standard business lawyer doing his job, had found to be true.

As he was dying of painful pancreatitis, they stood on the other side of the door and promised medical treatment if he would only sign documents stating that the thieves were innocent, and his innocent business clients were thieves. 

He would not, and he died refusing to say anything other than what he knew to be true.

The government did not leave it at there though.  They  tried Sergei  Magnitsky after his death -  something that the government had never done before and which was against the law, to say that he actually was guilty of tax evasion and theft,  and not the people who killed him to cover up their own actions.

I very much respect human rights lawyers, but they have a goal when they start their jobs, and that is to aggressively and publicly oppose powerful oppressors, knowing the risks. 

Sergei Magnitsky did not make that kind of deal, yet he refused to back down or lie about theft from his country. All of the other lawyers who worked with him took offers to flee abroad, but he refused. As a normal business lawyer, it would have been completely understandable for him to want to continue in that normal life.

The real politics are serious, and Crimea Tatars are being badly treated, but Eurovision is supposed to be a *song* contest, and when winners are chosen for anything other than that, it ceases to be a true song contest and becomes a source of strife, exacerbating feelings of mistreatment and even fueling conspiracy theories in multiple areas, not just a song contest.

This matters, because Eurovision was created to be a *unifying* event.

Anyone down voting is confusing justified unhappiness with the types of racism that persist in the United States with the state of actual, far worse racism in KSA, a country they never visited. 

For example, the USA, people with names stereotypically associated with poor Black people are offered professional job interviews at a lower rate than equally qualified applicants with white-sounding names. In Saudi, certain jobs are only accessible to certain races. A Black person, or, given the relatively low number of actual Black people in KSA, a dark brown person from the Indian subcontinent, could never be considered such a position under any circumstances. 

To put it another way, KSA outlawed slavery in the 1960s. The word used to mean slave means black.

I had it explained to me: Gulf Arabs are the best, followed by  certain types of Europeans, then Levantine Arabs, then the rest of Arabia, then the North Africans, then the Easy Asians, then the Subcontinentals, then the Blacks. (Yes I know this leaves peoples out but no one thinks about them much in KSA).

My parent saw this first hand. Working at a management consultancy, they were supposed to go to a project but couldn't so sent an Egyptian coworker instead. The client called an yelled, saying ""I paid for a European. If I wanted an Egyptian I could have got one myself.""

Compare that to the USA. There is no way that someone would call and complain they paid for a better race of consultant than was sent. 

There is definitely religious prejudice as well, but that mixes in with racial in some ways.

My father once had a proposal defeated by a Saudi even though his was better and he rebutted every one of the Saudi man's arguments. So the Saudi pointed out ""I am Saudi and you are not"" and that was that. 

I personally was called an unbeliever as an insult, but by an Emirati.  My injured friend and I used the elevator in the Dubai and his chubby butt felt that he should have it to himself, so he stage whispered ""unbelievers, unbelievers"" to himself all the way down. He then also took the first airport cart meant for the handicapped and and elderly, pushing everyone (non-Gulf Arabs all of us) aside. He wanted his own cart too - the other seats had to stay empty. The Pilipino-looking man driving the cart looked at us all apologetically but didn't stop him. Fortunately an Egyptian old woman was ha if none of that and stood in front of the cart, yelling at him and telling him to be ashamed of himself. By then he told the clarinet to around and he did.

614,"&gt;I know how pigs are raised in commercial operations and choose to eat them regardless because I agree with the majority sentiment that their entire physical existence is so that they could be killed for our palates.

Then you don't know (or you really do and are the rare sociopath). Many people don't, and avoid the available information with the justification that it comes from overwrought hippy types.  I used to be that way too, until I slowly learned more and more and realized how bad it really is. 

My argument is not that pigs should be raised to be ultimately eaten. It is that they should not be tortured their entire lives and killed badly to be eaten.

Given how much genuine animal pain and unhappiness the current agriculture methods cause (with the exception of a very, very small number of places that truly follow decent welfare guidelines instead of just claiming to), the question is not are you participating in raising and killing animals ""for your palate,"" it is if you are OK with torture and pollution on industrial scales because something tastes good. 

As for the whales, I am very aware of their argument. However, the fact that something is a tradition does not make it something that must be done forever, remain free of judgement (including by he practitioners themselves), or, if abandoned, mean the death of every other cultural practice.

I come from a quite traditional rural background myself. For my ethnic history and culture, I should be eating a lot of pork and dairy. I should be hunting deer, boar, anything really, and eating that too.  I inherited my grandmother's handwritten cookbook but can't make a lot of things in it because they require ingredients that buying now would be immoral. I don't judge her (and in fact, animal husbandry was a lot different when she wrote those recipes), but I know better given where we are today.  My cousins who live in our ancestral village don't hunt, even though that used to be a major activity. 

We also use electric light, washing machines, abandoned folk magic to cure bewitched cows in favor of veterinarians, expect everyone to finish school and maybe even go to university if they want (even the girls!) and are more tolerant of outsiders or even locals who are a little different. This is not a new thing, by the way. Serfdom is a long-gone practice, as are the worship of bronze age gods, the practice of raiding other villages, wolf hunting parties, etc...

That doesn't mean we've lost our culture or identity. My cousins who don't hunt, now hike and even participate in winter mountain rescue groups. My wedding included a church ceremony and party with traditional practices and dancing in our village. We still wear our clothes and eat our style of food and tell our stories and have our music and are who we always were, including people who try to do the right thing, and do it without making other creatures miserable to do so.",2016-05-03 10:21:36+00:00,d2qubxd,10.0,t1_d2qbz0p,38608.0,Foodforthought

629,"You make a good point about Litveneko's activities in the UK. I don't consider them as serious because by then he had not had access to anything truly sensitive or important for years, so had limited potential impact, but I agree that the degree of helpfulness to MI6 is not the main issue when someone who is supposed to serve their country makes deals with the intelligence services of another country (or a corrupt business/mafia leader in his own country first). The bigger moral issue then is the betrayal, not the impact. A traitor is a traitor because they betray, not because they are good at betraying.

I don't agree that assassinating Litveneko was on par with military action in Syria however. International military campaigns are always controversial themselves, but there is an generally accepted process and publicly accepted procedure. The people targeted are actively killing others, and the arguments in favor of such actions focus on the hundreds of thousands, if not millions of lives that will be saved. 

In contrast, Litvenenko was past his prime regarding his knowledge of and ability to damage real Russian security interests by the time he was killed, and was tool of Berezovsky - someone authorities did not feel a need to kill instead of or at the same time as Litvenenko.  At the height of his damages years earlier, he wasn't targeted.  That makes me think he wasn't killed because he was such a deadly threat that domestic and international law were less important.

What had changed was that he was getting more publicly and stridently critical of the Russian leadership, talking about sensitive things (apartment bombings) and crazy ones (Putin is a pedophile).

That's why the assassination bothers me.

As for Trump, to me it seems that he talks about isolationist ideas, but at the same times says things that sound like what he wants is big conflicts to push China and Mexico and even Russia around.  At the very least, he sounds like he doesn't know enough about foreign affairs and diplomacy to make good decisions that wouldn't inadvertently make things worse. I personally would like to see Bernie Sanders win. He is quite focused on peace, opposed Iraq and other US interventions and, when he talks about these issues and foreign policy in general, sounds like someone with some knowledge and some governance capabilities, and not the kind to inadvertently start a major conflict with an important partner trying to make them follow his preferred line (for Trump its really China that worries me most. I've heard interviews with him where he clearly doesn't know even the basics, yet claims he'll force a major growing power that is itself prone to strong reactions to serve the US economy against their own interests).

Perhaps it's because it was serious and painful and messy and she just wanted to put it behind her.

631,"I agreed with you right up to the point where extrajudicial execution is a reasonable response.  According to Russian law, even if Litvenenko had been tried and found guilty, for every law he truly broke, he wouldn't have been executed. He would have gotten a serious sentence and absolutely deserved it. But not death, let a lone a slow, painful death by mysterious poisoning.

So why is deciding, without a trial, that he is guilty of crimes and that poisoning him in another country, irrespective of Russia's laws or that country's laws, is acceptable? Particularly since he wasn't killed as he was committing his worst crimes, but rather years later, when his biggest act was to accuse the Russian leadership of various crimes of various plausibly/insanity levels (which gives the killing a political tone)? 

That's the part that bothers me - the rule of law part. I only feel sorry for Litvenenko in the way that I feel sorry for someone who got himself in a bad situation of his own making and for any creature in pain (dying of radiation poisoning looks awful).  But he played a very dirty game for years and knew the risks.  The part that upsets me so much is what the facts that Russian authorities could condone such a choice of actions - I want better for Russia, for all of the other Russians who need and deserve legal and transparent system of justice.

As for Trump, I think Putin would easily be the master of him. Which is part of why Putin likes the idea of President Trump. It isn't ""mutual respect among two great leaders, each appreciating each other's strengths."" It is a leader in Russia appreciating that a weak and divisive leader of a major rival causing real headaches for Russia right now would be helpful (can you imagine Trump trying to convince European countries to do anything? They already visibly mistrust him). In this context, Putin's statement and approach makes good sense. 

On Trump's side, I haven't seen him say anything that suggests he knows much about Russia or has a serious plan for working with Russia, just statements of how great he'll be when the time comes getting the right message and result. I also don't see a temperament or other foreign policy related statements that make it sound like Trump would be a reasonable, trustworthy and reliable partner with whom Russia (or any other major country) could form a real relationship valuing both country's concerns and interests. I don't see much of a world-stage-type politician at all actually, and worry that blunders by President Trump could cause the US to do things to make the world even more unstable.

In one way, the fact that OP has other options makes him a worse person than some of his corrupt clients. He can live a very comfortable life without ever having to make a serious comprise in principles. The Russian system does not allow business people that luxury. 

Therefore, I judge OP's choice to give into temptation as worse than his clients. Both did bad things, but he could have avoided doing it so easily, and with a relatively low cost to himself.

I would happier if the money stayed in Russia.

1. If it couldn't leave, corruption would be harder. Not impossible by far, but significantly harder, and riskier. 

2. At least the money would be in the Russian economy, which really needs it (capital flight is a huge problem and the ability to extract and hide profits from natural resource extraction suffocates other parts of the economy, even those with real potential). 

3. The government would be getting more tax revenues. The government is itself very corrupt, but a portion of the money does pay for needed services and there have been some serious cuts. 

3. Corruption is part of the system, true. Not just ""from the head,"" however, but in multiple levels of the economy.  Therefore, taking away a tool for people at all levels to use that weaken the entire system as they do it. 

4. Unable to hide their funds as well, wealthy actors in Russia would be more incentivized to push for rule of law and reliable courts in Russia. These people have influence on the leadership in a way that most Russians don't, so such pressure could be important. 

5. International criticism and oversight would have more legitimacy if the supposed good guys weren't obvious hypocrites. The current state of affairs also allows the Russian government to sidestep criticism by saying ""everyone does it and international pressure is just politics.""

6. The current state of affairs is morally wrong.

&gt; No they're not. It's not illegal to have an offshore company - as long as it is reported. Just like in the west.

I know it's not illegal. I said that in my above post as well, including the reporting requirement.  The original post implied that it was (and that these ""stupid law' was the reason that the poor, honest clients had to use holding companies), and my comment on the law-breaking refers to the clients referred to in the original post - if they are circumventing a ""stupid law,"" then they are circumventing a law. 

&gt; I agree, most of the banks (including many Swiss) providing banking services to Russians from abroad don't care about Russian law. But this is also changing. From next year on there will be criminal liability for assisting tax evasion by use of offshore constructs. So a banker might face up to 6 years of Russian prison.

I'm sure that they're hardworking. It's hard to succeed in Russia if you aren't hardworking and clever, and have or acquire connections. That doesn't mean they're not  also part of a corrupt system. They could be flat out corrupt, getting business through connections in a way that is illegal and/or immoral, or just paying their share to expand and stay that successful, or working for an organization that is handling that part in another department. But if they accumulate real wealth, in my direct, personal, multi-year experience, actually in Russia, actually looking at financial misdoing, this is the case.

709,"It isn't illegal to have a holding company. It is illegal to not tell your country's tax authorities if they require it, but this DB can't tell if someone has done that or not. 

I have a holding company with my younger siblings.  We have reported it to my country's tax authorities as required and pay proper tax on all income. We did it because, when my father died, his former business partner, who stopped being his business partner when they went to jail for forgery, started trying to steal his estate using forgeries, harassment and even death threats. 

We tried and are trying to deal with things in the courts, but corruption + religious prejudice are quote powerful in the country where the fraudster is based (not their home country. They are also wanted there for unrelated forgeries but the country where they are based found technical reasons to ignore the Interpol extradition request).  I didn't want this horrible person to be able to find us or our father's estate to continue this misery any more than they they already had.  So we got a holding company to hide them from a basic public search.

A friend of mine has one for a different reason - He works in one country and has clients in a second one. His country of residence does not accept this - it is not allowed (the regulation was written before the idea of working remotely existed). So he got a holding company to be the intermediary.  He works for the company in his country of residence, the company is paid in the country of his clients. He pays the relevant taxes in each country.  

I know other people who have them for tax reasons, but they aren't breaking the law by doing it. They just want to avoid paying more taxes than they have to, so they use the most tax efficient legal structure to legally not pay.  It's kinda selfish, but their total tax bracket at home would be 55% otherwise, so I understand the frustration. They aren't hiding their assets and they are paying what they owe, they're just structuring it so that what they owe is less.

And then there are the people in politically vulnerable countries. If your home country is corrupt and your business or assets can be taken from you for political reasons, or just because someone with more power wants them, it might be nice to have a way to make them harder for an attacker to connect to you, or to be able to keep them in the event that you have to leave your country.

I'm not personally worried about this leak since my family used a different law firm (lots of legitimate firms do this). I'm also quite thrilled with the information that has been published so far - these egregious and corrupt actors should be outed and punished for their actions. But I do worry about all of the other people. The totally innocent, or the kinda selfish but not illegal, who would have all of their data open to the type of people from which they were trying to protect it.

I personally would love to see that data. I expect I would find the names of quite a few criminals that I know about thorough my profession, but for which the journalists looking through it now might not know to look.

730,"I was in a somewhat similar situation, and right now my primary advice to you is:

Play for time.

There are a lot of hurt, angry and greedy feelings going around.  

Your grandfather basically told your relatives he thought you were better than them (sounds like he was right, but that is still going to work them up). If my father said that about me, I'd want to believe he demented when he said it, no matter how bad I really was. They may want money to show that the whole family is actually all equal and you don't think they're worse than you. They may really think they have a right to it, or that financial equality in the family is best for the unit. Or they are greedy bastards. Or some combination thereof. 

Your gf may genuinely feel now that you are stable, you can get married as you also wanted. Or she is afraid now that you're ""rich"" and above her in socioeconomic class you'll end up leaving her for someone ""better."" Or she's a gold-digging bitch. Or some combination thereof.

Your good friends are good. The others are immature jerks, but it may be more like they just don't get it and see it more as ""my friend is so rich, he doesn't care, he might as well share a little."" Also for them, it's more about money than a family loss. Or they could just be greedy bastards. Or some combination thereof.

You also are not in the best mental state now. It takes some time to come to real grips with such a loss and a change, and all of these pressures from everyone else won't help. You can't make any major decisions right now. No one else should either. 

So, play for time. 

With so many feelings and fears and expectations, the best thing for everyone before any decisions can be made is for everyone to take a breath and Chill Out, do some reflecting themselves.

Fortunately, the legal system will buy you some. Estates of real value take real time to settle. Like a year or even more. You yourself seem very uncertain of even the basic details. You need time to educate yourself and get the appropriate representation (if you need help with wealth managers you can pm me and I can tell you the basics, what to look for, avoid etc.) 

So tell your family you love them, think they're great, that you know that everyone loved Grandpa and love each other, but all of them need time to figure out what they have, what can be done, what can't how it works, etc. That emotions are very high after a death, that you don't know anything and time is needed for the estate to settle and work out what you even really have and can do.  Be vague, always say you don't know and need time to push them off for now and avoid debates/arguments.They also need time to reflect, mourn and chill out. 

Tell your gf them at you love her, but also don't know anything and can't do anything just yet. Say that after a real loss to you and so many changes and Very  Difficult Family Pressure (to imply she's adding to it without saying so) you need some time to get your head around things.  Say you love her and still want to marry her, but want to approach it with joy and stability. When (and if) that day comes, you can use your family pressures now and your advisors/lawyers' wishes to insist on a prenup. It's not about her, you love her. It's to avoid even more awfulness from your crazy family. A prenup, since your lawyers say it is standard (it is btw), will avoid a nasty fight. Of course she's your wife and you will support her and of course your children are your heirs, you just don't want to cause a fight. Make this about her being a good, supportive, understanding and loving SO - you and her against all the awful outsiders.

As for the bad friends, tell them the truth - this won't be settled for a long time and you don't know how it works. So you can't go on a spending spree. Also say that this isn't a cash infusion for you, but the death of a beloved relative, and you aren't comfortable spending anything that seems like blood money yet (I still have this problem two years later). Complain about greedy relatives wanting a piece of you instead of loving you or caring about your feelings in a time of loss. Then give them time. If they are still greedy and pushy when the estate is settled, eff em. If any are in truly desperate straights and can be saved by a one-time small cash gift, I'd consider it (really desperate people someone's have a hard time not asking for help) but that's up to you. You owe nothing to anyone.

TLDR: everyone's emotions are way too high, including yours. Play for time and push anything back until the estate settles.

741,"Perhaps the most prominent is the war. When the Nazis invaded, the USSR was unprepared. Stalin, who had not believed intelligence that this was coming, intelligence collected at great personal risk by patriotic agents, reacted by isolating himself for days and getting very drunk. In the mean time, much couldn't be done, much was in disarray and the Nazis chewed up Soviet soldiers as they tried to stop the invaders.

It took a year for the USSR military machine to get to a fully functional level, something for which Stalin was responsible. A year of human sacrifices as people tried to stop the Nazi invaders.  But then the military was in better shape, production reoriented, surviving officers and scientists released from the prison system to once again serve their country (Sergei Korolev, the Chief Designer, was one of them. Stalin's purge created a system where a professional rival could accuse and nearly kill the man responsible for the space program. Many of his colleagues were killed and we'll never know what they would have built. In the end Korolev also died early due to health problems caused by his time in the gulag, so his future achievements were also taken by Stalin).

When, finally the war was over, there was a victory parade (there had to be something - the whole country was way too excited to let it go), but Stalin didn't really like it. The idea of a parade celebrated the contributions of the whole country too much, and Stalin too little. So he stopped them, and Victory Day parades and celebrations of veterans only became a big thing after his death.


You could say similar things about other achievements. For example, industrialization was done on the backs of the millions of workers who were paid barely subsidence wages to hack entire cities out of swamps and a prison system that announced quotas of workers to be arrested to meet labor needs.  But ""Stalin industrialized the Soviet Union.""

But by supporting Stalin, you support the person whose  leadership failures lead to many deaths of Soviet people fighting a much bigger Fascist threat, and who then stole the credit of those same people to add to his cult of personality and claims of responsibility for every achievement of the country.

Also, these countries are known for economic policies unfriendly to business, or even economically catastrophic.

760,"A small town that lost out economically may boo, but they are a relatively small percentage of the electorate and economy and Merkel has bigger concerns.

1. Because of the refugee crisis and Syria, Germany needs Turkish goodwill more than it needs Russian. This is the same reason that the Eritrean slave state isn't even a topic of discussion by almost anyone in Europe - they gain nothing, and lose nothing.  That is also why Turkey felt safe enough shooting down the Russian plane.  Turkey knew that the international community couldn't react that much. Unfair, but that's realpolitik. 

2. By taking Crimea and supporting fighting in Donbass that killed thousands and shot down a plane filled with a lot of Europeans unconnected to the fighting, Russia broke rules in Europe that are meant to keep Europe stable and without too much destruction of each other. That will always bother a European country more than worse crimes occurring in a different society or region. 

3. One could argue that internal state oppression is bad, but sadly common (Germany kept good relations with Russia despite internal controls steps taken, and isn't sanctioning Poland for what they are trying now, even the criticism o fNorth Korea is more about their missiles and nuclear programs than their death/labor camps).  Changing borders and supporting conflicts in other countries is an international issue, and sets precedents that threaten other countries more than even the worse horrors that remain within a specific country. It is therefore more likely to attract international measures like sanctions.

4. Based on German news coverage, the German government, and Angela Merkel, is mad at Russia's leadership. For a long time she pushed back against Russian critics in the West and pressures to ""contain"" Russia, arguing that engagement would bring about a better situation for everyone, while hostile actions would make Russia defensive and cause the latter country to be less open to change or engagement.  When Russia got so involved in Ukraine, it made the Germans feel that they had been duped, essentially, and weakened their own plausibility, and therefore influence, in the international arena. Even more serious, Russian bombings in Syria appear to be targeting more civilians than other other efforts, civilians who will then flee to Europe, exacerbating the refugee issues. On top of that, Russian state-controlled media is using news broadcasts showing untrue things to work up people in Germany (especially the approx. four million Russian speakers) over refugees, possibly to weaken Merkel and her party and get the nationalist, EU-scpetics in power instead. As someone who believes strongly in the EU and in keeping her current job, Merkel is said to be quite angry about this Russian involvement in German affairs. Protests by ethnic Russians in front of the chancellery in Berlin, angry over Russian state controlled media reports reporting a rape that never actually happened, was particularly unappreciated.  . This anger does not encourage a willingness to compromise.

If they don't know how long it will take (and it will take a long time), they will be more patient.  

Also, it allows the numbers to be given out with a need to stay sequential. Not everyone is there for the same reason or with the exact same situation, so certain people may be called by the people responsible for them before others who got their number earlier.  Some people cancel their appointments, freeing up their number after others are issued.

792,"This situation isn't about convenience to the mother.

It is about who gets hurt more - OP or Michael.

In legal cases, the adult is usually the ones getting screwed and the child gets the benefit. The idea is that, it's a bad situation but children need more protection and support than adults do, so the adult loses to protect the child.

In personal cases, it should be the same. The question is, should OP be forced to spend time with a painful reminder of his betrayal or should BOTH boys - Michael whose father disappeared and his biological son who doesn't want to exclude his beloved brother - have to deal with some pretty deep feelings of hurt, exclusion and insecurity. 

In such situations, the right thing to do is for the adult to take on the pain to spare the children.

You are now forcing her to have to get over you, get over a failed marriage, meet an actual good husband, build a relationship with him and marry him, all before she is too old to have children.  

Even if she can do that, (which I doubt) you are going to put her through a long, difficult time.

It is a low blow to do that, and the action of so bad a husband, would have been better off without marrying you at all.

Nice, but not a historian. I still haven't seen any historical research. 



&gt; the article clearly acknowledges that Americans picked up the idea of tipping from their travels in Europe,

So it wasn't invented as a result of slavery then?


&gt; the people who were getting tipped in America weren't white; they were recently-freed slaves, who could earn money no other way.

So the Americans came back copying the practice they acquired in mostly-white Europe, but then only did so with black people? Or only in  former slave states that had enough freed slaves for them to constitute an employment demographic?  And and the anti-tipping movement grew so strong ebcause of concerns about a practice soley adopted to take advantage of freed slaves? That doesn't make much sense. Actual research is required to prove this. 

I can see why freed slaves, being among the weakest in society, would end up taking jobs that paid the worst, including those that depended on tips and didn't require the employer to pay them directly, but I don't see how that means that tipping was developed (or, more accurately, practiced, since it already existed), solely with them. 


&gt;  the American model of restaurant tipping, where the diner decides whether and how much to tip the server, is uncommon. In most of the countries I've visited, no tip is expected at all.

Then you left a lot of unhappy people behind you. Some countries (wealthy Japan comes to mind) don't expect tips in many contexts, but most places do to varying degrees.  In the American model, the amount is often higher than in most other developed countries where the tip is not considered to be so large a share of total income, but even in those other developed countries,  it is most certainly expected. In countries where the workers are poorer, tips are even more appreciated. [Here is a page from Conde Nast Traveller to help you. It lists the tipping practices in 50 countries](http://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2008-11-11/etiquette-101-tipping-guide).",2016-02-21 18:12:57+00:00,d08b0u1,5.0,t1_d085hh9,9719.0,Foodforthought

No information on other countries or how it fully evolved in the US once it was settled by Europeans, or how the idea as you understand it (payment at a meal for service actually developed in the US, or in the other countries where it actually developed first. 

Also, the argument that country tips exactly like the US is deliberately too specific and also not 100% accurate. I've been to over 60 countries and some form of tipping exists in all of them.  In Russia they call it tea money. In German, it is money to buy a drink. In English the actual term tip revolved in the 1600s. Slavery did not play a significant role in any of this and the United States or other countries with a large Slave population were not the originators of the term or practice. To ignore everywhere but your specific area of interest is bad historiography. 

What is more, a modern comparison is not relevant to a discussion of the origins of something that did not originate in the modern era. The tipping systems and practices in place now are not a valid basis for claims about how something that developed centuries ago developed.  Something that didn't exist before the latter half of the 20th century is not a relevant part of the discussion about how tipping, somethings that predates the latter half of the 20th century, evolved. This is also bad historiography,

It is an appealing theory, but the above comment is just more bad history, sorry.

848,"Fun fact: People often don't say niggardly because they think it is connected to a worse word and that belief really can upset people who believe that, but there is no actual connection. The etymology is of ancient European origin from a time that predates the N-word: 


&gt;Niggardly: ""mean person, miser,"" late 14c., nygart, of uncertain origin. The suffix suggests French origin (see -ard), but the root word is possibly from earlier nig ""stingy"" (c. 1300), perhaps from a Scandinavian source related to Old Norse hnøggr ""stingy,"" from Proto-Germanic *khnauwjaz (source of Swedish njugg ""close, careful,"" German genau ""precise, exact""), and to Old English hneaw ""stingy, niggardly,"" which did not survive in Middle English.

&gt; Niger: nigger (n.)  1786, earlier neger (1568, Scottish and northern England dialect), from French nègre, from Spanish negro (see Negro). From the earliest usage it was ""the term that carries with it all the obloquy and contempt and rejection which whites have inflicted on blacks"" [cited in Gowers, 1965, probably Harold R. Isaacs].

855,"They needed more.  The Soviet Union believed that a nation (that was mostly agricultural at the time of the revolution) had to industrialize in order to become a workers'-based society (a requirement for communism) and to compete globally.  They did it, but at tremendous costs. 

To that end, they constructed factories and entire cities as fast as possible, using slave labor (mostly under Stalin) and as much of the population they could get to build and then run them.  Getting women to work was one quick way to increase the workforce, but every possible hand was needed.

An interesting insight into this is I Chose Freedom by Viktor Kravchenko.  He defected to the US at the end of WWII and wrote an autobiography. He ran factories as they built and tried to staff them and described the desperate demand for manpower. As he was working in the 1930s and 1940s, more prisoner labor was used than in the 1970s, but even so, more workers were needed. 

He also describes daily life as a relatively well-off factory director in Ukraine's coal mining area and factory town locations and then as a bureaucrat in Moscow, in the 1930s and 1940s (not the better-off 1970s) which may be of interest given this thread.   He mentioned access to consumer goods as important, as workers sometimes came to him unable to get basic items, or were unable to afford them as a new coat might cost a month's wages. In contrast he had a house and a driver and could get what he needed. When he left the USSR, one of the first things he did was go to a store and see how accessible some clothing items were, i.e. who could buy them and what percentage of an average monthly wage would they be. 

Also, although getting workers to fuel industry was hugely important, and privileging workers was ideology (Communists like workers), it was also pragmatic to encourage people to become workers, improve the prestige and influence of the working class and disadvantage the prone-to-opposition intellectuals.

By the 1970s the time of stagnation had come to the USSR, but the country was not going to stop privileging workers by then. It would have been counter to all ideology and most political incentives. ",2016-02-09 13:30:56+00:00,czte4z5,5.0,t1_cztbmrp,8089.0,AskHistorians

866,"&gt; Why don't you just take a protein pill and a carbohydrate pill and a fat pill and stop eating altogether?

1. While getting the vitamins needed to have a healthy vegan diet in a pill is pretty easy, science cannot deliver a pill with carbs or fat or protein or all other required nutrition. 
 
2. Because I like good food. I want to eat it. 

&gt; Why are people vegans? I don't get it. 

1. Because the way that almost all animals are raised involves their suffering while alive. Truly humane animal agriculture does exist, but is very rare.  Fishing is also quite cruel to the fish. I can eat healthy, good food without funding the suffering of living creatures.  

2. Because of the environmental damage in terms of water usage, manure, antibiotics overuse, fertilizer overuse, energy costs and other environmental costs of animal agriculture.  I can eat healthy, good food without funding the damaging of this world that I, my loved ones and my future children have to live on. 

3. Because of the health benefits. Animal products are linked to many healthy problems including cardiovascular and cancer issues. Since I stopped eating animal products, I lost weight and look better. I also avoid the heavy antibiotics and growth hormones that are so contributing to antibiotic resistance and the many chemicals in fish. 

&gt;mostly because my gym trainer says. Ehh, why not?

The reasons above. Also, your gym trainer may say that eggs are good to short-term muscle growth, but my doctor and multiple scientific studies say that a good vegan diet is healthier than vegetarian, and vegetarian is healthier than meat eating. 

&gt;It's cruel to animals? Like they'd grow old in the wild and die of cancer if we weren't here with their loving chicken family surrounding them?

[The cruelty isn't just that animals live their nice lives but are killed.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_animal_farming) They suffer every day. 

&gt; I'd eat human if they serve it somewhere. If your body can digest something and make energy without being harmed, it's food. 

1. As some others have already mentioned, human is bad for humans. 
2. There are lots of things that I could eat, but I do not. This is true for you as well. You do not eat scorpions. You do not eat chocolate for every meal. You make your choices. I choose to make choices that are better for my own health, better for the animals and better for the planet. 

&gt; Everything else is psychology.

And morality. And good health. I choose to be aware of the how the world is around me and how things affect me and others. I choose not to financially support the unnatural treatment of millions of animals that causes them to live short, unhealthy and painful lives. I choose to avoid funding unnecessary practices that damage the environment and makes me unhealthy and pudgy. If I can avoid all of that with a good diet and a daily vitamin pill, I want to do that.

902,"I don't like that he isn't informed. He called for the release of sailors from Iran after they were free. He didn't know that China is building on contested islands, and then he guessed they already he finished. He has repeatedly said things that are factually inaccurate. He says what gets the biggest reaction, actually knowing anything doesn't matter as much. He also lacks any real plans. Just saying ""I'll get along with Putin"" doesn't mean you can get along with Putin or that Putin wants to get along with you. Just saying ""I'll create jobs,"" or even ""I'll make Mexico pay for a wall"" doesn't mean you can do any of that. He is right that much of the political system is corrupted, but he is part of that very system (note that Wall Street isn't nearly as worried about Trump as they would be if they took his statements seriously). 

And it doesn't matter, because he plays to an uninformed base that is concerned about their place in the world and who won't care how awful or unqualified a person is as long as he tells them they're special, their problems aren't their fault and he can fix them (which he can't, any more than he can make Putin be friendly or restructure the entire global economy).

Your comments on Putin's endorsement of Trump are an example of that. Putin views the US as Russia's primary rival. He also uses that to army as a justification to stay in power. He can't hide that the economy is bad and the government highly corrupt, so he offers to protect against the big bad ISS instead.  If you paid any attention to his statements, actions or the content of the media in Russia (most of which is state controlled) you would know that. 

You would also know that he supports far right and angry groups throughout Europe to weaken the EU (another rival), and that supporting Trump fit nicely into this pre existing strategy. You would know that his leadership is *not* good. That he missed multiple chances to diversify the economy while they had money to do it because it would have reduced the billions to the corrupt oligarchs and security service leaders that are his real constituency, that he dragged Russia into E. Ukraine and isolated the country.

You would know that the country's economy is doing very poorly, that he doesn't need to worry about immigrants because he has his own domestic terrorists, many of whom were radicalized during a vicious war that he led and may have even started to get himself elected the first time round. They continue to be violent because he took a strategy of letting the most violent and corrupt rule in the Caucasus in return for nominal loyalty, and now we have a situation where even the FSB wants the worst madman, Kadyrov, to go, but he is personally loyal to Putin and he stays. 

You would know that Putin doesn't even mind migrants seeing how Russia has more than any country other than the USA (they come mostly from Central Asia). He has reasons not to want more, some of them even good reasons, but he also likes using the migration story of W. Europe as something to show his people about how terrible it is elsewhere and how important it is to support him as the protector against that terribleness. 

You would know that he thought he could get China to be his new ally against the West, but that China just used him and his weakness to get good gas deals and other concessions, and that he is now trying to get back into some level of partnership with the West but generally bungling it because he has so isolated himself from any criticism that he recently gave a very tone deaf interview with a German outlet lately that did not go over well. At this point I don't even know how much he knows is going on (and, in contrast to Trump, I do believe he tries to know).

TL:DR Putin and Trump are both bad, albeit for very different reasons. I dislike all of the republican candidates, but would take any of them over Trump. They are all part of the same, self-interested system, but at least the others pretend that knowing what they're deciding about is important. ",2016-01-23 02:09:41+00:00,cz8ivf6,,t1_cz34yj5,,germany

930,"&gt;I meant in comparison to other places.

This is not true.  In Spain, Jews were not even allowed to exist. Even with serious problems elsewhere in Europe, Spain was arguable the worst towards Jews. Other areas, like the Ottoman Empire, were better still. 

In the 1300s, multiple state-supported riots killed thousands of Jews. In many places, the only way to survive was to convert.  Crusades began not with setting off for the Holy Land, but with killing Spanish Jews at home.

In the 1400s, Jews were no longer allowed to exist at all in Spain. They had to leave the country, or convert.  

If you literally cannot survive and reside in a place, when you could in many neighboring places, then that place is not treating you well.

But the stairs weren't marked either! There were no signs which floors were exit floors. So we kept walking, past the actual exit floors, until we were in the basement, where the fire actually was.

958,"&gt; If he was ready to marry her without converting her, why did he force her to convert and then marry him instead of forcing her to marry (not that this would be acceptable)? 

If you read the article, you will see that he was fine marrying her without a conversion. She was the one that refused to marry him, when he was willing to marry her without any conversion. She explained her refusal as saying that her family would not accept a cross-religion marriage (although judging from his other behavior, she may have thought this was a way to get rid of him since he would not accept just an ""I don't want to"").

A rational person would understand that her family wouldn't accept it if she converted either. A rational person would not think kidnapping her and forcing her to convert to his religion would somehow remove the family opposition, or her concerns about family opposition. 

&gt; If it was just the family's demand, why was it so important to him for her to convert? 

The family's demand was from _her_ family.  He didn't seem to have any objection to the marriage before. 

Conversion only became important to him later (when he kidnapped her)  when he started a larger pattern of actions designed to control her. 

He harassed her and people she knew so extensively that she returned home to try and stop him. Religion was not part of this harassment.  Instead, he wanted explicit photos and her to return to him. Once he could reach her physically, he kidnapped her, locked her up, raped her and beat her. He made her promise to marry him. 

The conversion was just part of this larger pattern - ""oh, you say you own't marry me because of religion? Then you be MY religion.""

&gt; More likely case is that even if she had married him without converting, he would have raped and forced her to convert after marriage.

Seeing how he is an unbalanced, vicious stalker with serious control issues, you are probably right about that. But it seems most likely that he would for the control reasons that he exhibited  in _all_ of his behaviors, not just the specific religious control behaviors. 

TL;DR Actual religious fanatics focus on religion, not on controlling all aspects of a woman.  This guy is a textbook case of the vicious stalker that sadly exists throughout the world.

966,"Not realistically.

I used to think that killing the animal for meat was OK was long as the animal had a comfortable life and humane death.

However, unless you are one of an extremely small minority that is able to directly source your animal husbandry and slaughtering services from the extremely small amount of people who actually are humane (as defined by easing healthy, comfortable, happy animals and killing them quickly and with a minimum off pain and stress) then you are actively contributing to animal abuse by buying meat.

Even the supposedly humane farms are not more often than not, and the slaughterhouses to which even actually humanely raised animals must be sent in most developed countries are definitely inhumane and consistently do not follow even their own minimal standards.

There are multiple reports on these topics and I encourage you to learn more about them. If you need help please PM me. I'd pull a starter list together now but I'm on my phone. 

Therefore, it doesn't matter if you think killing an animal is fine as long as it lived well (itself a contentious argument but one that you've demonstrably accepted so I won't touch on that here). 

Sadly, if you buy meat from the animal agriculture system in a developed country, you are buying the meat of an animal that suffered. (If you buy it in an undeveloped country it probably suffered too, but that is a different set of situations that I'm assuming don't apply to you. Please correct me if I'm wrong).

I'm sympathetic, because I used to be in your position. It was research that steered me away from it, and I was initially unhappy to do so. I was looking for a way to keep eating meat, not knowledge that made it impossible for me to do so. But facts are facts.

It took a adjustment period, but now I have figured out how to cook a range of interesting dishes and don't miss meat  at all. I even lost weight. :)

967,"I have.  There aren't many world-wide, but they have a presence in a city where my parents and I were also located for a while. 

The first was what I'd consider a victim. 

He was my parents' handyman for years. Very nice guy, within the range of normal intelligence but not very bright. Scientologists somehow convinced him to let them use his credit cards and get more debt until he owed almost 60K USD. They also had him working for them for 8 dollars an hour when he made closer to 50 on his own. 

When my father found him a well-paying job in a low-tax country where he could work for half a year and pay off all his debt, the scientologists told him he was not allowed to leave to a place where they would have limited contact, and that if he left he'd have to owe them for ""free"" training they provided.  

My father told him ""just go. I think they want you to stay because without constant oversight you might see them more negatively and they'll lose their useful cash source. If I'm right about this, you'll be better off. I'm wrong and the teachings are still meaningful to you on their own, then at least you'll have paid off the debt you now carry."" So he wanted to go, going so far as to get a foreign passport to get the visa. But they pressured him more and he backed out. 

He also upset my mother when her mother died and he tried to ""help"" her the Scientology way (and much against her wishes) by taking her around the house and making her look at various household items and say ""this [random household item with minimal connection to my grandmother] does not remind me of my mother."" She told him to stop but he wouldn't. He wouldn't stop even up to the point where she told him she'd fire him if he didn't. He was so sure that any minute shed see how great the approach was and feel better. So she fired him. 

She rehired him later though when he called asking for side work. He was getting deeper and deeper in debt and couldn't pay it off on his Scientology wages, so wanted extra work even though he had been previously forbidden by the Scientologists to work for my parents.  She always liked him and felt sorry for him, plus hoped that maybe his willingness to break the rules was a sign that he was on his way out. 

Instead he stopped working with them for a while and when she called him for more work, he never returned her calls.  I don't know where he is now. 

------------/

I personally met some more serious scientologists myself when they tried to recruit me. I was part of an animal project and received an email inviting me to a lecture by a conservationist who had just returned from a study of that animal.

The invitation claimed that the lecture would be held in a private home, even giving the names of the couple hosting it. The conservationist's organization was one I never heard of, but the website looked legit, I support conservation of ""my"" animal and I was free that Tuesday evening so I went. 

I arranged for a friend to meet me there, but she was late. So for the first part of the pre-lecture reception I was alone. I walked around the house and very quickly I noticed the house wasn't really lived in. What is more, every piece of wall decor was related to L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology. There were quotes, documents, pictures, celebrations of accomplishments (some that I later learned never happened). There was not one family photo, full clothes closet or even a toothbrush in the master bathroom.

All of this was creeping me out a bit, but I was also curious, my friend said she was almost there and the lecture was starting soon so I went back downstairs to get a snack. I was standing there, munching alone, when the woman who invited me introduced herself. She was quite good looking. Her friend, a good looking man, joined us as well. 

While I certainly try to be interesting and entertaining, they quickly weirded me out by _how_ great they seemed to think I was, asking me lots of questions about myself and finding all answers fascinating. I tested them by telling a story that I personally found very boring (my dryer broke because a ribbon from a short somehow broke off and got in the machinery part, but finding it took a while), and even that was interesting and cause for consideration. 

Then my friend arrived and I escaped them. When I wasn't alone they also seemed less interested.

The lecture itself was fine, but was not as billed. It was just was a man who said ""saving X animal is great the end"" for less than 15 minutes. Then all guests were again thanked in the name of supposed couple hosting us and invited to explore the house/L. Ron Hubbard museum.

When we left, there was a man handing out parting gifts, supposedly from our host couple.  We each got a bag with a small book and CD with a nature picture on it and a ""personality test"" from the scientologists. I never put the CD in my computer, but I did flip through the book. It had very little connection to conservation at all. Instead it was mostly filled with vague maxims in simple language such as ""do good"" and ""help others that do good."" 

The personality test was also pretty basic. Do ever ever feel stressed? Why yes, on occasion I do, clearly there is something wrong, save me Scientology! 

When I googled the publisher of the ""nature book,"" I found that it was a scientologist one.

Overall the approach seemed pretty basic and unsubtle. I would have had to have been considerably more vulnerable or stupid to fall for it. My animal project required a lot of money, so possibly they thought I was a potentially dumb rich person patron? Whatever they thought, I declined to send in the personality test they gave me and I never heard from them again.

I think the Book of Mormon is a collection of easily disproven stories (Native Americans didn't have wagons, didn't live as described, aren't descended from Jews, etc) invented to make Americans feel special and relevant at a time of great Christian activity and doctrinal diversity, and I am firmly against mandatory tithing, but the purpose of the Mormon/LDS church is not to exclusively exploit its members, and it is possible to be a Mormon and live a fulfilling life as part of that organization.  The same is not true for all but a privileged upper echelon of Scientologists.

Really this video is sort of ridiculous as an argument against silk, as it is not of the source of silk, or showing the way that silk is harvested.

That said, actual silk production is usually bad for the silk worms. Silk worms are actually the caterpillars of the silk moth.  They spin cocoons, and those cocoons are the source of silk.

Unfortunately for the silk worms, the process of leaving those cocoons damages them, both through the hole they make and through enzymes they release to weaken the threads to make getting out easier.

Therefore, the silk worms are boiled in their cocoons. This kills them before they can damage the silk, and makes unwinding the cocoons easier. The silk worms themselves are sometimes eaten.

There are types of silk made from cocoons after the moth leaves. It is a bit rougher and thinner however.  This is often called peace silk, wild silk, Ahimsa silk and Eri silk. Technically, there are some differences between these types, but all of them don't hurt the moth. 

Another use for the cocoons of hatched moths is silk cocoon fillings.

1002,"Hilton Kiev had bedbugs. They bit me all over, sent me to the emergency room, caused the loss of my 500-dollar suitcase and a thousand dollars of business clothes inside. 

I was tormented by itching and pain on a level I didn't think possible from small bug bites. For more than a week. I spent a lot of time very out of things during an important week for work thanks to the stupor-inducing drugs I was prescribed in a fruitless effort to try and minimize the itching. 

Plus it was just gross to see the paths of bite marks that the bugs made as they crawled across my skin. Accross my face. The panic and fear I felt before I was diagnosed also was unpleasant, as was the bed bug paranoia I felt at home for weeks after I was diagnosed - I thought that every brown speck could be an infestation that followed me home. 

When I told the Hilton Kiev, they ignored me. They ignored my emails and posted letters, and when I called I was always told the right person would call me back, but none ever did.

When I told the Hilton headquarters in the US, they also said someone would call me back, but only sent me a form letter that said that despite the hotel having a Hilton sign on the roof, the bill saying Hilton, my credit card statement saying Hilton and the main Hilton website listing the hotel as a Hilton, it was not a Hilton, it was only a hotel managed by people using the name of Hilton, so there was nothing they would do. 

Apparently Hiltons are only Hiltons when they collect your money. Once something goes wrong, they are entirely the property of whoever physically owns the building, and not of the company setting the management standards or whose name is on the building.

I was in a badly-managed hotel fire in Dubai that could have killed me if the hotel had anything to do with it, but this Hilton nightmare resulted in more actual suffering so it wins the worst travel experience. Plus, the hotel staff in Dubai did seem upset by the fire. The Hilton staff in all countries didn't seem to care at all that their rooms were crawling with insects giving their customers weeks of disgusting torture.

But once an initial investment is made, or stock is sold, or bond issued, the company that gets the cash does not directly benefit from additional gains (excluding the relatively rare instances when a company issues more stocks or bonds, borrow money elsewhere or sells some equity to new investors).  Otherwise, all the money made goes into making more money for the people who hold the shares.  If they have enough, then the issue about spending a low percentage in ways that grow the economy and benefit the population as a whole applies.

1017,"&gt; And yeah, maybe this is naive, maybe corruption is the norm there, and he just lets it slide if no one is complaining too loudly. It's impossible for us to know

Not true. We most definitely do know.

I lived in Moscow for a long time and still live there for part of the year, and the fact that the entire governments system is based on corruption is very apparent and a secret to no one. Grannies know it. There are many, many surveys and studies, even the leadership admits to it at times, there are scandals (like how [Putin's daughter is a billionaire](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/russia-capitalism-daughters/) getting government contracts, or how many government employees,  like [the press secretary Peskov](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/vladimir-putin/11780027/Vladimir-Putins-spokesman-in-luxury-watch-scandal.html), wear [watches that cost more than their officially reported lifetime earnings](http://www.businessinsider.com/russian-leaders-and-expensive-watches-2012-10?IR=T), or the many mysterious ""unclaimed"" mansions [in Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putin%27s_Palace) or [abroad](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/01/house-of-secrets)), there are even periodic government promises to tackle it. 

And yet it stays there, because the entire system is based on access to wealth in return for support for the leadership. Lower the wealth, lower the support. At such a delicate time, the leadership needs the support that it can get. So corruption is protected.

In the case of sports, it is also quite possible to know that the leadership was OK with the corruption. The report details how government employees (FSB* agents), working at the test lab helping to conceal athletes' doping. 

This wasn't happening because the government didn't know any better and Russian culture is corrupt. 

This happened because sports victories (important for public opinion in Russia) were so important to the government, that the government itself intervened to help make it happen, even if that meant doping.

Russia is by far not the only place where athletes cheat by doping, and Russia is probably a more attractive target because of the political situation, so that seems a bit unfair to me, but the fact is, they were an easy target in this case because not only did individual athletes cheat, the athletic system, and the security services, and therefore some of the most powerful people in Russia, participated too.

Now they are caught, and Putin will say what he has to in order to mitigate the situation.

1020,"In and of itself, it doesn't. My 1000 gold pieces don't impact you gold piece. 

There are ways that it matters, however:

As a sign of inequality:

That a small number of people have collected so much and so many others haven't collected even a small amount, that is a sign of a system created to the benefit of those few. In this context, the problem is not that I physically hold more than you do, it is that you weren't able to get more than one gold coin, while I increased my amount from 100 to 1000 easily. 

Now that I have 1000, I can use them to influence the situation to keep them, and keep getting more, even if that means I'm increasing my share of income at the expense of yours. Tax breaks for me and removal of regulations = good. Education programs, higher salaries for my workers or new regulations to prevent things like economic crashes or environmental catastrophes = expensive, i.e. bad. 

Because my influence is so great through my money (be in campaign donations or contracts after leaving office), politicians need to worry about me. They don't need to worry about the ""average"" citizens and their interests nearly as much as my interests and those of others like me. So the system gets even more skewed in my favor. 

Impact on the economy

 If I am very wealthy with my 1000 gold coins, I will spend a smaller percentage than you will of your 1 gold coin.  Even after my staff,  homes, couture, airplanes, family office, etcetera, there will be a lot left over that I will invest, mostly in equities. 

If 100 people had 10 pieces of gold instead, or even 10 people had 100, they would spend more of that money in the ""actual"" economy, i.e. the kind of spending that is most helpful in growing the economy for everyone, would be higher. 

I might also invest in real estate. Great for me, bad for someone trying to find a home or smaller commercial property (just ask places like New York or London, where outside investors help keep prices unaffordable).

Having wealthy people isn't a bad thing in and of itself. I personally like what income and assets I have, and would like to have more. I really dislike paying higher taxes and would love to pay less.  

However, if the gap between the wealthiest and everyone else continues to grow, the interests of everyone else will continue to shrink even more than they already are. That is the concern.  I like my money, but I like clean air, infrastructure, a stable financial system and not seeing unemployed students begging on the streets next to their grandmothers.

I felt bad for eating it, but in a way, I also felt good. Not for eating the poor chicken, but for the confirmation that I really had ""kicked"" meat and moved into a better way of eating.  

When I stopped eating meat I got a lot of questions about missing it, and sacrificing good food with self discipline and suffering.  For me, not liking the chicken was confirmation that I could use to show the doubters that that no, I really removed any desire for meat and can have a fulfilling, craving-free diet that isn't cruel, terrible for the environment and unhealthy. Through that, I hope that maybe some others who love meat and think giving it up is too much of a sacrifice could do it too.

1043,"Without knowing more, my guess is that your BF is letting anxiety about his family judging him and you overcome his understanding of your moral beliefs and health concerns.

I have a proposed compromise.

Some vegan substitute foods are not that as good as the meat versions, or at the least are identifiably different (which some inflexible people won't like on principle no matter how good it is). Your bf is likely thinking that if you bring a substitute, it will stand out as ""vegan"" and be disliked for a ""weird"" version of an already well-known dish.

If his family is really like that, they are lame, but you two can't fix that and he probably doesn't want to admit it. 

I therefore suggest that a compromise dish would be a new vegan dish that doesn't have an obvious non-vegan version to which it can be compared.

There are many tasty options, you can find some here or google about yourself.

That way, you can bring something good for everyone that isn't obviously the ""vegan version."" It is just something tasty for all to eat without thinking much about it, that just happens to be vegan.

Once people compliment your dish and thank you for bringing it, you can say its vegan and ideally bring them around a little to thinking of eating vegan as a doable and reasonable thing, after they already tried it without preconceptions.

Women also face many challenges because they are women. They still are legally considered half the value of a man when it comes to giving testimony and inheritance, can be divorced much easier than they can divorce, face social difficulties if they do divorce, can't give citizenship to their children if they marry a foreigner (while men can, which, when combined with expensive wedding costs, results in many men marrying of foreigners and women being stuck single), rely on family permission to work (and require their husband's permission or they legally can't work) and have their own lives even as adults for social reasons, have limited recourse in the case of domestic violence, face losing their children if they do divorce, often marry spouses approved by family, and, in the case of three sister at leasts, can be arrested and held in secret for tweeting criticism of the government (specifically, they tweeted ""I miss my brother"" after he and 68 others were imprisoned for political reasons and accused of attempting to overthrow the government in a very flawed trial).

A related issue is reputation. Women must be seen as ""good."" If they are not, their lives are severely disadvantaged, but so are those of their relatives. If a family raised one ""bad girl,"" the feeling is, then the others are also probably trouble. The fear of hurting those they love keeps many Emirati women in line even if they personally may want to push the boundaries in line. Some men too. 

Emirati also face requirements that they be ""moral."" This means virgins until marriage and ""modest"" at all times. If they don't go out on their own and only associate with the best people, there is a good chance that they won't be raped. Therefore, the logic goes, being in a position to be raped means that you put yourself in a position to be raped, and are therefore not the greatest yourself.   

Wealthy expats are also not immune to this.  

There are cases like the 16 year-old French boy who was forcibly raped, and then accused of being a homosexual (also illegal) 

http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=3932740&amp;page=1

Or the Danish woman who was raped by her coworker while in Dubai on a business trip,and found guilty of having sex outside of marriage and sentenced to 16 months in prison. Her rapist was also convicted of having sex outside of marriage, but only got 13 months.

http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/20/world/meast/uae-norway-rape-controversy/

And if it goes to court, the judges and lawyers are not independent. Emiratis and Muslims win over others, men over women, connected businessmen over poor people.

Or the warning issued by Human Rights Watch to expat women who may think that they are safe in the UAE, but who should expect to find unequal treatment should they go to the police for domestic violence or seek custody of their children following a divorce.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatnews/11012631/Human-Rights-Watch-warns-expat-women-about-the-UAE.html

In all of the cases that were are now discussing - the poor maid, the poor boy and the poor Dane, the only thing that saved them was that they were discussed by the press, publicly and internationally.

The UAE, especially Dubai, cares about their reputation. If expats understand that they are unsafe, that the courts and police will not put pure justice first, they and their money will not come, and the city will fall apart. The leadership therefore intervenes in high profile cases.  High profile events seem to be the only thing that gets real movement. So, silly as it may seem, things like Reddit posts and upvotes, likes, and online petitions could actually help in the case of the UAE in a way that it can't in most cases.

In the mean time, avoid it. The World is filled with enough fun, interesting and lucrative places where being raped (or having sex outside marriage, or facing an Emirati in a business dispute, or asking for your legal rights as a worker, or missing your activist brother), won't get you imprisoned.

1047,"OK, I actually went through the whole report (something that I recommend that you do):

&gt; 1) The much discussed bow ties. The missile would churn our bow tie shaped shrapnel. The Dutch found 4. Considering there would be thousands and many of those would have missed the plane as detonation would be through a 360 degree vector where are they? 

According to the report, the bodies of the victims showed injuries in keeping with shrapnel.  However, the bodies, who were always under separatist / Russian control until handed over and never were under Ukrainian control, were tampered with. Someone cut into the bodies and removed items that, based on the injuries could have been the shrapnel.  The ones that the Dutch found were the ones that who ever cut out the rest missed.

The crash site and bodies were never under Ukrainian control – always separatist and/or Russian.  Ukraine had no interest to remove the shrapnel anyway – Ukraine wanted people to think the plane was felled by a BUK.  However, the Russian/separatist side at the time was claiming that it was a Ukrainian missile fired from a jet that couldn’t even fly as high as MH17.  It was in the interest of this narrative to remove shrapnel.

However, now no one on any side now tries to pretend that anything but a BUK brought down the plane - the evidence is just too strong and the evidence in support of the alternative proposed explanations too weak. 

Now you might try to argue that now even Russia doesn’t pretend that it wasn’t a BUK, and that now, the Dutch tampered with the victims’ bodies and deliberately ruined the investigation into the deaths of so many citizens to cause problems for their own second biggest trading partner removed the “right” shrapnel from the bodies (the kind from the older BUK missiles that Russia claims were used) and planted the different shrapnel type to hide that the shrapnel came from an older missile that only Ukraine has , but that overlooks two big questions:

1. If they are willing to cut open bodies, remove shrapnel and plant a few new pieces, why weren’t they willing to plant more than just four? You are right – there should be many, and the bodies had many shrapnel-type injuries. So why not add some more to keep up that pretense?

2. Russia uses both types of missiles. Russia claims that they haven’t had 9M38 missiles for years, but there are multiple photos [that show that they still do have them]( https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2015/06/03/evidence-the-russian-military-supplied-the-type-of-missile-used-to-shoot-down-mh17/).  Changing the missile type doesn’t change any conclusions that can be made about responsibility. So why risk such huge troubles with Russia on so sensitive a topic involving the death of so many citizens to do it? Or why not do it with something that is more conclusive?  

 &gt;2) Shrapnel marks of the left engine. These should be minimal if the Dutch trajectory is correct, but it is not? ...Why 3) There is a strip along the plane with no shrapnel marks. Impossible according to the Dutch/Ukrainian calculations.


In a spreading pattern at a less than perfectly perpendicular hit on a stationary smooth service, some missed spots are to be expected. No one – not Russia, not Almaz-Antey - has complained about this because it isn’t a problem.

Er, no they weren't. No one serious has even claimed this. Even the Russian government's many ""alternate theories' don't promote that idea that the calls were real, only made  prior to the crash. I've been following this crash in reasonable detail since it happened (in English and in Russian), and I haven't seen anyone really trying to push this wacky idea.

Not even when one of the people on the call was reached by a journalist did he claim to have made the call at a different date.  

That theory also doesn't explain why someone in the same area as the MH17 crash would be describing the personal documents of someone on MH 17, or why there would be a different plane debris site in the area with civilians, personal effects and an airline part that said ""Malaysian Airlines"" before MH17 crashed.

First recording
[Male voice, identified as separatist leader Igor Bezler] The group of the Miner [an alias] has just shot down a plane, which came down just behind Yenakiyevo.

[Col Geranin] Pilots. Where are the pilots?

[Bezler] Gone to search for and photograph the plane. It's smoking.

[Second male voice, identified as Russian military intelligence Colonel Vasily Geranin] How many minutes ago?

[Bezler] About 30 minutes ago.

Second recording

[Male voice, captioned as ""The Greek"" ] Yes, Major.

[Major] Well, the Chernukhino lads shot down the plane.

[Greek] Who shot it down?

[Major] From the Chernukhino roadblock. The Cossacks at Chernukhino.

[Greek] Yes, Major.

[Major] Well, the plane fell apart in the air, near the Pertropavlovskaya coal mine. The first casualty 200 [military 
jargon for dead body] has been found. A civilian.

[Greek] Well, what do you have there?

[Major] Basically it was 100% a civilian aircraft.

[Greek] Are many people there?

[Major] [Curses] The debris fell right into backyard.

[Greek] What kind of aircraft?

[Major] I have not figured this out yet because I haven't been close to the main body of the debris. I am only looking where the first bodies began to fall. There are the remnants of inner brackets, chairs and bodies there.

[Greek] I see. Any weaponry there?

[Major] Nothing at all. Civilian things, medical bits and bobs, towels, toilet paper.

[Greek] Any documents?

[Major] Yes. From an Indonesian student. From Thompson University [curses].

Third recording

[Male voice, identified as a fighter] Regarding the plane shot down in the area of Snezhnoye-Torez. It's a civilian one. Fell down near Grabovo. There are lots of corpses of women and children. The Cossacks are out there looking at all this.

They say on TV it's a Ukrainian AN-26 transport plane, but they say it's got Malaysia Airlines written on the plane. What was it doing in Ukrainian territory?

[Male voice, identified as Cossack commander Nikolai Kozitsyn] That means they were carrying spies. They shouldn't be [curses] flying. There is a war going on.

Also, [the Russian TV station Life News reported immediately after the attack that the separatists shot down a Ukrainian military aircraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjUpRD6yMYg). Life News is a media outlet with ties to Russian security services.

Note: I chose that version to link to because it has English subtitles. It is of two reports though - the first the one on the day of the crash saying that the separatists shot down a Ukrainian plane at the time and place that MH17 was shot down. The second is a later report by the same TV personality claiming that it was Ukraine that shot down MH17.

Off the top of my head...

I would start with the two that I mentioned above - real campaign finance reform plan and reasonable, workable plans to fix the tax code.  

I would ask from which people/industries/interests does the candidate derive the majority of their funding and what initiatives related to their interests has the candidate supported. 

I would ask how much the candidate lies, perhaps based on PolitiFact's Truth-O-Meter ratings. Below a certain rating it doesn't matter if what they say agrees with my wishes because those statements become meaningless.

I would ask how the candidate plans to work around and to help fix  the impasse between the two main parties (and arguably, within the Republican party). This is a party/congressional issue more than a presidential one, but the president has a strong role to play in politics and the broken legislative branch likely cant fix itself alone. 

I would ask about what foreign policy approaches  the candidate wishes to pursue, what the candidate believes America's role in the world should be and what approaches to take towards that end. 

I'd also ask specific questions that relate to that, e..g. opinions about how to deal w Russia, relationships w Western Europe or the Syrian problem, how to work with a growing China that is increasingly powerful but does not share stated American values.

I would ask what the candidate's opinion on military intervention is - do they have a clear idea of when involvement is a good idea versus not, and, most importantly, an idea of what goals to have and a workable plan of how to execute them when there. 

I would ask about about economic policy, about actual plans to increase real income for most Americans and address income inequality (not just if they say that it is bad, but rather does this candidate have any workable suggestions to address it) and to address the fact that the US' relative share of the global economy is shrinking. 
I would ask how the president plans to support America as a global economy without making too many ethical compromises. 

I would ask if the candidate has a real plan to address climate change that could actually work. 

I would ask if the candidate had experience managing a major enterprise though major change with success. 

Having a preferred platform is always good, but a candidate addressing important issues (or not addressing them) is, to me, more important a consideration and a ""does not address the issue"" is a more important disqualifier than just selecting among he issues that a candidate has chosen to mention.

&gt;You go ask someone on the street if Afghanistan is in the Middle East and I'd be 9 times out of 10 they'd say yes

Not true. And I was in Afghanistan.

Afghanistan is very clearly in Central Asia. No one who knows anything about the region says it is in the Middle East. Afghans don't think they they are Middle Eastern any more than they think they are Chinese (another area they border on).

Jihadi/Islamist groups also don't think that Afghanistan is in the Middle East. In Islamic terms, Central Asia is called Khorasan and Ma Waraʾ al-Nahr, the land beyond the river (the Amu Darya and Syr Darya are major rivers that define the region and also give it is classical name of Transoxiana, Oxus being the classical name for Amu Darya).  

This area has histories, cultures, ethnicities, terrain and languages different from the Middle East. Unsurprisingly, it also has different identities.

Unlike in parts of the Middle East, the were never had enough Arabs and Arabic speakers following the conquest to Arabize the culture. Even nominal Arab rule lasted a relatively short period of time FYI, only about 200 of Afghanistan's 2500 years of history. There were no Arabs before the Muslim conquest (which didn't conquer all of modern Afghanistan FYI), and once that ended around 850, all of the ruling dynasties were a combination of Persian, Turkic, Mongolian or local Pashto.

There is a sense of connection through Islam, but Al-Qaeda was not founded in response to any feelings about Afghanistan or Islam there. The grievances that sparked Al-Qaeda were related to US influence and actions in the Middle East, specifically a strong US presence in Saudi Arabia during and after the first Gulf War. Afghan issues did not fit into their ideology or statements at all. That all came later, after the US invasion of Afghanistan.

The only reason Al-Qaeda was in Afghanistan at all prior to the US invasion was because they were kicked out of Sudan following pressure by KSA and had nowhere else to go.  The Taliban were already global pariahs, they needed Bin laden's money and they liked his ties to fighting against the Soviets (even though Bin Laden and the US were on similar sides then).

That you can forgive a lot, but you can't move past your husband lying to you (in case it does involve your relationship, this might work). 

He will yell and be awful and try not to tell you, but do your best to stay calm but firm. Do not apologize. You have done nothing wrong. You need to know what your partner is life is up to. 

If that doesn't work (and it might not) insist on counseling. Say that wth such a huge hole and mistrust in your relationship you don't see how it can survive. If he refuses to go, go without him.  

If he truly won't tell you after all that, then it is truly bad and you do have to leave him. But hopefully it won't come to that.

Something that I've found helpful: Work out in advance how you want to phrase what you want to say. These discussions will be emotional and upsetting and if you have some sentences worked or in advance, it will be easier to say them and stick to your guns, and avoid being dragged into an emotional screaming match.

However, be warned that it is not so dynamic. Things can take a while to get done. In fact, one of the reasons that my father loved it so was because he said it reminded him of Austria in the 1950s, but with better weather (friendly, polite, clean, efficient but also not a rate race with too much hustle).

 It certainly has progressive elements but also conservative ones (just ask the PM). 

Also, it is expensive. The rest of NZ is not as expensive as Auckland, but even so, prices are on the high side. Which is not hugely surprising when you consider that NZ is a small market on relatively distant islands.

Another thing to consider: the South and North islands are different enough that you should look into which you prefer more. 

Really, you should go there yourself and spend some time checking it out. You can do it for cheap-ish if you rent a camper van and drive around.

1076,"Being as closeted as he is would complicate any relationship, but it seems to me that he has problems separate of being closeted.

- He doesn't treat you with respect when you are together (witness his handling of a trip that was mostly your effort. Asking ever so often ""are you OK"" is not nearly enough to count as being considerate, while much of what he did surrounding that trip was very inconsiderate).

- He uses you. You help him out a huge amount, financially and in life, he lets you do it for him, but I don't see you mentioning what he does for you. 

- Some of what you say sounds like trying to justify the situation to yourself. Accepting that someone isn't the person we desperately want them to be can be very painful, especially when they do have some good qualities (just not enough) to make it seem like there is hope. 

- He cheated on you and lied about it. Probably a lot. You caught him talking to one guy, but he has been on hook-up apps (with a profile himself) for a long time within your relationship.

All of these issues do not have to exist, even in a deeply closeted relationship.  People had completely secret relationships their entire lives while still treating their secret SOs with respect and consideration.  

If it were just the cheating, I might say give it a try. Relationships can survive that, given the full commitment of both parties and serious changes by the cheater. But reading what you wrote above, the issue is less sexual contact with another and more that he does not treat you with respect and consideration, and that the cheating was just one of many indications of that.

It sucks, but sometimes we love people who don't deserve it.  Sorry.

The good news is (and I'm speaking from experience here), is that, while it certainly painful, and difficult, and awful to accept this, to have the self respect and strength to know what you deserve and accept no less (so break up with them), it does, eventually get better. You will get over it, plus have life experience and self respect to handle your own relationships better in the future. I did, and now I have an amazing husband who is a thousand times better than any guy I thought was so great before :). 

There is no quick and easy fix, and I am truly sympathetic to you and the difficult time that you are facing. There is a lasting fix though, and that is to move on and, eventually, find someone better. 

If you really can't bear these awful truths, you can try your 'come out"" ultimatum as a test of how desperate he is not to lose you. A better test would be a complete change in behavior to that of a caring, considerate, non-asshole boyfriend on all levels (not just deleting some apps).

Don't be surprised when he chooses to leave you instead of come out, or if he makes a lot of promises about the non-jerk part that he gradually stops keeping.  

If I were in your shoes, I would skip both of those last steps as they will just drag out the misery and give him a chance to try and blame his inexcusable behavior on you. The sooner you start to move on, the sooner you will.

1086,"You needed permission to leave the country (and a foreign passport, which was not automatically given). Within the country, some areas were closed to outsiders without permission for security reasons (this included whole cities, usually because military, intelligence or security-related science operations were there). 

Vysotsky did get permission to travel abroad, first Poland and then France. He was so famous by that time, when the Soviet officials refused him permission, the head of the French Communist Party personally requested that he be allowed to come. From there he travelled to some other countries, including, the US (he had permission to go to France, and continued on without any permission). He was so famous by then he wasn't formally punished.

Beyond that, you needed a place to stay when you arrived.  A place at a hotel had to be arranged and approved (hotel were all state-owned at the time) and you had to register with the government (something you still have to do if you stay in one city more than eight days, although if you come s a tourist your hotel will do it for you). 

There were also regional punishment restrictions (although Vysotsky did not have one). This was mostly requiring that someone live somewhere  - e.g. the Russian Far East or Siberia after release from prison there, or, most famously, not coming within the MKAD - the large highway ring that circles Moscow. 

What Vysotsky did have was the need to perform somewhere, and that wasn't supposed to happen without permission either. He was was actually charged with unauthorized performance in Siberia but was so famous that he ended up getting ""just"" a heavy fine.  

A related issue was selling tickets to these unofficial concerts (also forbidden). Vysotsky faced charges for ""conspiracy"" to sell concert tickets (in the end the charges against the famous man were dismissed, although others with whom he was charged were found guilty). 

He also faced a third charge that might have been politically motivated, although, given his well-documented substance abuse problems, may have been real - for a car accident. In that case the sentence was suspended and he was put on probation, which meant more state involvement and restrictions.

Right now the average male life expectancy in Russia is 65.

There is some concern that the current economic problems will stop or even reverse that growth, but male life expectancy has been increasing over the past decade (along with commodity prices and therefore Russia's economy). 

Women do a lot better - right now the average female life expectancy is 76.5.  The difference is due to lifestyle (a lot more drinking, smoking and bad eating among the men), a male tendency to ""be a man"" and not worry about things like safety or check-ups or second opinions and the stresses of the economy and income issues (unskilled jobs that traditionally went to men are hit the most, gender roles make that more of the man's problem, not that women aren't heavily involved in the workforce).

If you want to convince people to to hunt foxes, the focus should be on the fox, not the safety of the hunters. 

A note on the fox: in many cases, the foxes are not deliberately killed - only treed (chased up a tree) and then left there to continue its fox life. Occasionally the hounds will catch the fox themselves and kill it, but usually the fox lives. 

This allows fox hunters who want to feel like good people, but also want to fox hunt to tell themselves that it is humane because they aren't killing the fox in the end.  I've even heard the argument that foxes are so wily, they enjoy the ""game"" of escaping the hounds.

But the question was not what they should do.

The question is why they do what they do do.

It is very difficult to change someone's behavior without knowing that part. 

A note on the fox: in many cases, the foxes are not deliberately killed - only treed (chased up a tree) and then left there to continue its fox life. Occasionally the hounds will catch the fox themselves and kill it, but usually the fox lives. 

This allows fox hunters who want to feel like good people, but also want to fox hunt to tell themselves that they are only doing the fun part, that it is humane because they aren't killing the fox in the end.  I've even heard the argument that foxes are so wily, they enjoy the ""game"" of escaping the hounds. They want to keep the pets of hunting including the hounds, the unpredictability and speed they think that this is an OK way to do it.

I try to point out that the fox doesn't know that it is a game and that it will be left free once it is in a tree. As far as the fox is concerned it is running for its life with a pack of hounds right behind.  I say how everyone would be horrified if I threw rocks at a fox, but somehow if the fox isn't right in front of me, it doesn't have feelings anymore? I've had people agree with that point.  I've never had anyone respond well to ""so you enjoy tearing apart innocent animals then?""

How is not fox hunting out of care for the fox not animal rights related?

How is answering an ""I don't understand how people do X"" post explains how they do it not relevant?

How is understanding why fox hunters do what they do not animal rights related? You will never get people to change their behavior if you don't understand it.

People don't hunt foxes because they enjoying tearing foxes apart.  They enjoy it because parts of it are fun, and they don't know or care enough about the fox to give up that fun.

If you tell them that they are bloody animal torturers, they will tune you out and nor care what you think.

If you tell them yeah, it is fun for you to ride about, and socially important, but even when the fox isn't killed, it still suffers and here is how, they may listen.  If you steer them towards alternatives that give them similar benefits (social fun on horseback) without tormenting foxes, they may even do them instead.

From NATO's perspective, Turkey is in Europe, which is not the same as ""the West"" (e.g. Belarus is not considered Western by most, but Canada is).

There are multiple definitions of the West, but most are political, cultural and/or economic, (which is how Australia and New Zealand are often included, and sometimes even Japan gets in, even though they are nowhere near the other ""Western"" countries, but Russia is not included, even though it is filled with white Europeans, most of the population lives in Europe, and the ones that don't still live more ""West"" than Australians or New Zealanders).

In that respect, Turkey is often not included in the West because culturally, economically and, importantly, politically, it isn't the same. It has the potential to become Western if it wanted to, but it doesn't seem interested in going that direction, or at least its government and the people that voted for them do not. 

In the case of Syria and Iraq, ""the West"" is typically used to mean Western European countries and the US, as they are the ones who may fight ISIS or deal with migrants/refugees in a way that makes the news (Turkey of course has way more refugees and migrants, but being on the border, that is the traditional place where refugees are expected to be, so they get less attention for it even though they have a lot more that the countries that the refugees are dying to reach).

Russia responded by blocking food imports from some Western countries.

The increase of food prices due to these anti-Western sanctions don't hurt the government that much though.

Her tenant is a harpist, and therefore works in the evenings quite a lot. She is also a very small, older woman (so not very confident in her ability to handle an intruder).

The tenant keeps a bowl of chocolate candies out, mostly for guests. One day, she noticed that the bowl seemed lower. She filled it up and thought she misremembered. But then she noticed again a few weeks later. And again a few weeks later than that.

The neighbors' teenage son had recently smashed some things on the property (he was quite troubled and threatened violence before being sent to an in-patent mental health center for some serious issues), so the harpist tenant was very afraid that the neighbor kid and some of his scary friends were using her house as a hang-our spot while she was at performances. If they ate a chocolate per visit, they wouldn't notice a difference in the bowl level the way that someone looking every few weeks would.

Because of the previous frightening vandalism smashing and threats, my mother took this seriously. She didn't want to confront the neighbor kid's parents without proof though, and maybe he wasn't the intruder at all - maybe it was someone else. So she installed an alarm system. 

It never activated, but the chocolates still disappeared. This was even more frightening because it meant that they were getting in through some unknown entrance. It is an old house with many surprises and weak points. 

The harpist tenant was now quite afraid - she wasn't out every night and the intruders could easily surprise her in her home without her even knowing they were inside until it was too late. 

So my mother installed a hidden camera. For a long time, they saw nothing. Then, they finally got the intruder on film. 

It was mice. The house is very old and in the country, and it had mice. For a mouse a single chocolate is a feast, and they would periodically come and get one. Months of fear and some expense over murderous teenagers and it was just chocoholic mice. The tenant bought a candy dish with a lid and the chocolate stopped disappearing.

1166,"My dog is a shelter mutt. She's cute, but not the most adorable dog in the world. Not even the most adorable in the shelter. But oh, is she wonderful. She is the perfect level of loving - friendly and loyal and affectionate and sits on my feet in the cutest way, but not clawing, needy, and up in your face. She housebroke herself in a day. She learned tricks and behaviors very quickly. She is happy, but steady and calm - not anxious.  She is healthy and has a good constitution. She guards me and the home against actually threatening people, but is friendly and welcoming too all others. She is everything you could possibly want in a dog. She is 15 (old for her size) and still doing well. 

I chose her because she seemed to have the best temperament of the available dogs - purebred and mutts, but I had no idea how good a dog she really is until I got to know her.  The vet commented on the same - she is a solid dog. 

In contrast, my husband's purebred German shepherd was weaker. His dog was beautiful - people would stop us in public to comment on how lovely she was or make offers to breed her based on her looks. She was also very sweet - she had a heart of gold and loved us very much. But she had a range of problems stemming from being a purebred, i.e. inbred. Her hips were weak - she needed help getting into our high SUV (and she was not a light dog). She had a weak stomach - if the two ate something bad, my dog would be fine, my husband's dog would vomit or have diarrhea in the house, usually on an oriental rug. She was anxious - she would cry the entire time she was at the groomer, or if something unusual happened, or if we were gone too long. If she didn't like something, she would let it be known by emptying my husband's office trash can. If she really didn't like it (like when we moved and she was anxious in new surroundings), she showed it by repeatedly pooping under the dining room table. And saddest of all - she died. She got lung cancer at age eight and it killed her.

I loved my husband's dog. Her heart was good and she was a sweetie. But the people who bred her to be lovely did her no service - she suffered because of her inbreeding and was more difficult to deal with as a result.  In comparison, my shelter mix beastie is happier in life, living longer, and is easier for those who live with her.  Based on my experience, I'd go with sweet mix over show dog every time.

That part of the discussion focused more on the erroneous assumption that such serious people go to BlackHat (and can get DefCon passes through them), when really BlackHat doesn't offer them much either. 

But for closer people, or people on the edge of deciding one way or another (as more and more people will be as the event continues to change in response to changing demographics) the pain of getting passes does matter. I know people in Las Vegas right now who have gone to DefCon in the past, and who are not this year specifically because the line makes it not worth it to them. I know others who didn't bother to come, again in part because of the hassle.  The line isn't the only factor in making the decision to come, but it can be the one that pushed a potential attendee in one direction or the other.

The crazy wait leaves a bad taste in the mouth of people who value their time and are used to others valuing it too. It wouldn't be quite so bad if it weren't completely avoidable. Do Jeff Moss et.al. need the evaded tax dollars and above-capacity ticket sales proceeds that badly?

1186,"That is not true, at least not for actual researchers. 

BlackHat is of interest to some industry types and a lot more corporate. I went once and decided it wasn't worth the cost or effort - I knew some of the speakers and could easily get info on the rest if I didn't see the talk in person. My company will pay either way - I just didn't want to be there. 

All I need in Las Vegas is to see people to maintain and extend networks, hold meetings, see some of my clients in person to maintain a friendly relationship and go to corporate events. Note that actual professional learning or collaboration is not on that list. Many researchers don't think BlackHat itself is worth their time.  

DefCon is a little better because it's effectively shorter and cheaper, so worth it even if you don't intent to spend every waking hour there. So some people still do that.

I personally am still going to DefCon because hey, its only really two days and as long as I'm in Vegas I might as well try to see some talks in person. I also think this will be my last year to come to Vegas at all so I'm feeling a little nostalgic. But many people I know are not, including those who directly cited wait time and lines as a reason.  They don't *need* DefCon and if it gets too annoying, they won't make the effort to go. 

My company doesn't care - they will fly me out for the reasons I mentioned above. If I attend no talks at all, it makes no difference to anyone in operations or marketing (marketing of course is the department making the biggest effort for BlackHat and DefCon,  so they coordinate my logistics). 

One close friend (a Very Serious finder of Very Serious Vulnerabilities and writer of Very Serious Exploits) told his company that wanted to send him ""I will go to Las Vegas, but you should know that I will only sit by the pool by day and go to dinners and parties at night. I won't go to any awful conference events."" They still sent him. They know the talks aren't the point at his level.

Actual researchers, including some past speakers that I know (and a current speaker at BlackHat who will only be attending his talk), don't take either event as seriously as they used to, and making things more of a hassle just discouraged them even more. 

For some, this extends to not going to Vegas at all. Most people still go, but more people every year decide that it's not worth it. As the industry expands, the demographics of who goes to Las Vegas are changing and the so-called serious people are less interested. First, the ones who had to come from Australia stopped, then Europe, and now even people I know from Austin question the value of going to Las Vegas one more time. Not when there are other, more serious research events and private networks (and the sexiest research isn't publicly discussed so much anymore). It is the ones who have sales or media functions of some type say they plan to keep coming indefinitely.

The livestock don't. They are supposed to be treated calmly and then stunned, but that is not the fate of [almost all animals killed in factory processes](http://www.animalaid.org.uk/images/pdf/slaughterreport.pdf).

That also assumes that their lives were free of suffering in the time leading up to the slaughter, which is rarely the case in factory farming. Even most ""humane"" farms, if they really make an effort, can't stop the transport and slaughtering process form being a nightmare for the animals. 

I don't eat meat. I want to, I really do, but after years of deluding myself that ""humane"" options are humane, I did enough research that I couldn't lie to myself any more. I also care about the environment, which helps keep me trying to be as good a person that I can be.

They got the first stage, that is, a new government. That is a pretty big result that the protests/meetings in Russia did not.

Now the Ukrainians need to get more and better results for their own sakes. If this works, and they do get a better government, this could encourage Russian protesters to try again to get rid of their own corrupt leadership to get a better system the way that the Ukrainians did.

If the Ukrainian effort ultimately results in a country that is worse off, then the opposite effect can be expected in Russia. Russians will see that overthrowing a government can lead to a worse situation, and be less inclined to oppose their own leadership even when they see problems. 

That is why it is in the interest of the Russian leadership to make sure that Ukraine goes badly.

No one says ""I received a letter from the Federal Security Service"" or ""I joined the Forces of the Special Designation."" They say, in Russian, FSB or Spetsnaz.

This might explain why it works the other way too (another issue raised elsewhere in this thread).  In Russian, people say NATO, which reflects what westerners call it when actually discussing it, even if the Russian acronym of the direct translation isn't N.A.T.O. (Well, НАТО in Cyrillic). 

Add to that the fact mentioned by another poster that many people not fully and deeply familiar with the language do know the full phrase versions of the popularly used short terms. Even if you said Russian federal security service, many foreigners wouldn't really know what that meant they way that they would if someone said FSB.

The question more should be, why are there so many special abbreviations in Russian? This is the result of a trend that began after the creation of the USSR. The Russian Empire trend was to long, highfalutin names to give things status. The Soviet reaction to that was to give things a descriptive name in keeping with the long-name trend, but then use a more modern, ""progressive"" acronym or abbreviation when discussing that thing.

1236,"&gt;The total loss of life is somewhere around 60-70 Thousand people killed, with most of those deaths having occurred during the summer and winter offensives.

[UN says 1/10th of that number were actually killed and estimates six thousand total deaths](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/02/ukraine-conflict-death-toll_n_6782010.html). Even DPR only claims 3,684 civilians killed. [Russia Today cites Ukrainian government figures of 1800 military and 7000 civilian total dead for a total of 8800](http://www.rt.com/news/272404-donetsk-lugansk-international-tribunal/).
 
Six thousand, or even nine thousand, dead people is still a terribly high number of dead people, but not at the level that you describe. 

&gt;Of course, all this is mainly only happening in eastern ukraine. However, the rest of the country is still suffering very badly in economic terms, with the Ukrainian Currency having devalued by over 50% or whatever it was...

It was 46%, after [the central bank stopped supporting it on the recommendation of the IMF](http://www.valuewalk.com/2015/02/ukraine-hryvnia/). It has mostly [stabilized since then](http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=UAH&amp;to=USD).

It is worth noting that, from a bitcoin perspective, the terrible performance of the hryvnia may help bitcoin. Inflation and a lack of faith in the currency may encourage more to look at bitcoin as alternate means of saving, spending or transferring. Ukraine (and the whole RuNet really) already was more comfortable with electronic currencies before bitcoin came and attracted forex speculators and people who didn't trust the centralized companies like Webmoney.

It is true that the Ukrainian economy is doing very poorly.  Economic activity continues, however. The GDP dropped from 183 billion USD in 2013 to 131 billion USD in 2014, which is  a bad and serious drop, but also means that there was still 131 billion USD in activity. 

&gt; Edit: I would like to add that there is a very good chance Kiev will launch another offensive, resulting in 10's of thousands more deaths. The front line could change if the separatists launch a counter offensive

Kiev keeps saying that the LDR/Russian military will, because the current territory controlled is not enough for a viable state, or even a viable frozen conflict zone. No one has though. Fighting continues and Minsk-II is violated by everyone, but there is no major offensive and it is almost August.

1241,"&gt; This is something we've been hearing about forever, yet urban centers experience the highest growth in population and capital.

Both could be happening at the same time. Educated people leaving Russia, and people in the regions moving themselves or their money to the relatively better off major urban centers within the country. Another thing to look at is the rate at which the major urban centers grow in population. Prior to the current economic problems the urban centers were growing - are they still growing at that rate, has it increased, or has it decreased?

&gt;the service and the tech industry has experienced higher growth than most other sectors 

This is true, and some (like the IT sector) are real testament to Russian brilliance and innovation when they don't have to deal with legacy obstacles.

If you are in Russia, you must be living in a very privileged Moscow or Petersburg bubble if you genuinely think that is true that fear is not a major tool used by the leadership right now. But if you are in Russia, I doubt that you are that isolated to really think that. There aren't panicking hordes in the street, they don't expect another Operation Barbarossa, and most people are mostly going about being themselves and living their lives. However, as you well know, the political and media narrative is one of fear, outside enemies and need to support the leadership against them.

1244,"Brainwashed? No. Frightened? Yes.

I know that there were many reasons to be unhappy with the domestic government a few years ago. The parliamentary elections and the castling were reminders that the system is completely rigged and got people worked up.

However, after the meetings/protests resulted in nothing, people who thought that maybe they could change things, decided that they could not and became less politically involved.

I know that the government response was to step up the propaganda and the conspiracy theories. To paint the Russian problems and Russian political activity all the work of the West, especially the US, trying to tear Russia apart. It was also to paint the world as just as bad. To convince Russians not to expect more than their current system, and not to trust outside critics (who were depicted as just as bad as the Russian leadership). 

I know that the events in Kiev were painted as fascist programs driven by Western plotters, and not as a result of Ukraine's internal problems.  I know that the chaos that resulted there because of internal problems and because of Russian meddling was also painted as the result of political protests, and the Western meddling. I know that the Russian leadership encourages this chaos in Ukraine and makes it seem even more chaotic on the Russian news because a protest that actually resulted in a new government has to be shown as leading to chaos and a worse situation - otherwise the Russian protesters may feel that their mistake was just not trying hard enough and try again. 

I know that, as the economy did worse in Russia and inflation hit, the Russian state-controlled media blamed it all on Western meddlers. It didn't admit Russian actions in Ukraine, or why it is that Saudi Arabia would want to increase the oil supply and lower the price for its own reasons. This worked so well that some people even think that Russian government laws banning the imports of certain foods from the West are actually Western blockade efforts.

I know that, in Russia, the news became far more hysterical overall. The amount of fully fabricated ""news"" events increased. What opposition outlets existed were closed or severely curtained. People who did not agree lost their jobs. Outlets that did not agree lost advertisers, distribution contracts and leases. Companies like VK were taken over by pro-state allies. The government is trying to increase control over the Internet infrastructure and companies, while trying to replaces as much of it as it can through ""import substitution.""

I know that even the weak opposition permitted to exist, the people that a poll taker might think of as an alternative to Putin, were severely restricted or discredited by accusations of treason.

Russians are understandably frightened of chaos and instability, and the government and its media outlets have spread such a feeling that they are the only wall between that and the people. That resulted in increased support, even if it is a fiction hiding a truth that the leadership's weaknesses are a major threat to Russian stability.
 
I know because I watched it all happen first hand.

1263,"They are not ""two peas in a pod.""  They are rivals for power whose interests sometimes overlap, but who often conflict.  The Sauds made a deal with the Wahabbis several times - when they rose to power, when they took it again (the British helped them take it but the clerics helped them keep it), to combat pan-Arabism, to combat ideas about democracy and civil society, to weaken the Saudi Shia, and to keep control in the country. 

This is not to say they they are friends however. By making these deals, the Sauds allowed the arch conservative sections come to power and can't take too strong steps against it. They then faced their opposition when they did things that the religious conservatives do not like. By opposition I mean things like the siege of Mecca, the assassination of King Faisal (yes, the religious conservatives KILLED a King for introducing television to the country and cracking down violent opposition to the same), the rise of Islamic opposition following the presence of so many US troops during Gulf War I, a low-level domestic insurgency that caused the deaths of hundreds if not thousands of Saudi security officials and soldiers following Gulf I and during the Iraq War time, and many more cases.

The Sauds used the clerics to eliminate competing ideologies, and it worked.  The problem is that the religious conservatism is the winning ideology accepted by most of the population.  The Saud's legitimacy now rests on their roles as religious conservatives. If they step too far from that, and are labeled too liberal, i.e. insufficiently religious, they are therefore seen as insufficiently legitimate by a population raised in this mindset. If they move against clerics, they are seen as moving against God, and God is presented as the source of their legitimacy. 

It doesn't help that the Sauds are corrupt autocrats vulnerable to genuine criticism - they have to be even more cautious amongst the religious leaders who hold moral authority as a result. 

The Sauds are trying some things. It is very easy for any Saudi to study abroad - the Saudi government will pay for all of it. There is a major university and research center in the country, plus smaller centers where the rules are not as strict. There are small changes made in the regulations and rules. And some of the younger generation, exposed online to a range of ideas, is more liberal (some. There are lots of ideas on the Internet).  There is widespread hatred of the mutawa/religious police following some horrible scandals. 

But there is much to be done. And not every member of the entire ruling family or the other major tribes are honest, clever, liberal and skilled politicians. But to say that they are ""peas in a pod"" with the religious authorities, or that they all share the most extreme views of the religious leaders who threaten their existence is not true. 

TL:DR Making assumptions based on partial information is risky.  Learning the basic facts about a country is useful before planning a government's downfall.

1265,"&gt;  They cant just do all sorts of provocative things to other nations and expect their own people to say ""Thats not right. We dont do that kind of thing if we are the good guys"".

The reality in Russia as presented by the media there (and most people do still get it from the TV), is that Russia IS the good guys, resisting US efforts to expand power and spread chaos to increase their own power, weaken Russia and also just because they don't think things through.   The Internet is a Western project filled with lies. 

This works because after the USSR fell people expected the US to be their friend and helper, and instead got shock therapy economics, serious disintegration of their country and NATO enlargement. So they are primed to be suspicious of the West in general and US in specific. Also, there is some xenophobia and nationalism going on as well (it always feels better to think that your problems aren't your fault).

For people who are connected enough to the outside world to doubt this narrative, there is the narrative of doubt. Yeah, the authorities in Russia are corrupt and lie like crazy, but so are those in the West. There is no difference between them - everyone is just as corrupt and just and full of lies, so you can't believe anything they say. 

This works because much in the West is corrupt or hypocritical and the Western media do have biases. The fact that these issues are not nearly as extreme as they are in Russia is easier to conceal than the fact that Russia has these problems.

The other choice is to go to the Reykjadalur (Steam Valley). There is a park there that is filled with fumaroles and hot springs, inclung one area where a cold mountain strem meets up with some hot springs and makes warm, swimmable water. 

There is  also a geothermal park in nearby Hveragerði. It is tiny, and a total tourist trap within a fence, but it has a hot stream and they'll give you the gear to cook an egg in it.

There is the geysers to see, including the famous Geysir that gave the noun its name. Geysir doesn't go off too regularly any more, but there are others that do, most famously Strokkur.

You can take a cave tour outside of the capital - go with a guide not to get lost. 

For bigger vistas you can go to the Snaefellsnes peninsula area. There is the Snaefellsnes glacier to climb, nearby seals to see and a hotel Búðir nearby that has a cute historical church founded by the efforts of a local woman, a good restaurant and cute main area. Rooms are clean but less nice (they had a fire and spent their money rebuilding the public areas). They also organize nearby events and activities.

Gullfoss waterfall is pretty spectacular - it disappears into a chasm in the ground.

We really enjoyed the area around Þingvellir in Silfra - the tectonic plates are gradually pulling Iceland apart at a rate of about 10 cm per year. We went snorkeling in dry suits (3 degree C water means crystal clear water). You can also scuba. I strongly recommend this.

Horseback riding is also cool in Iceland - the horses have their own gait in addition to the standard walk, trot, canter, gallop.

Holy Skaholt was interesting, if somewhat small - it is a neat place to stop by if in the area.

We also took a boat out to see the puffins but Im not sure if the puffins are there right now  - check if they are out to sea.

Whale watching is also nice.

There is also a small island accessible by boat from the capital that houses the old governor's house and a church that is interesting.

Crimea was the first step in destabilizing Ukraine and making Maidan look like an event that ended in an even worse situation for the country than people had before. That message is very important to the Russian leadership. They are still nervous after the meetings/protests of a few years ago. Those largely died out because of a loss in faith that protesters could achieve meaningful change. The Madian protesters did achieve regime change, and had they been able to take that power change and make the country obviously better in a country as similar to Russia as Ukraine, it could have been very encouraging to protesters in Russia, just at a time when economic difficulties were predicted. 

The fact that Russia got Crimea back was more like a really nice bonus - good to have but not enough to prompt action on its own (which is why they didn't do it earlier). Firstly because many Russians really do believe that it is part of Russia and getting it back made them more likely to support the state and secondly because of the strategic value to the Black Sea Fleet.",2015-06-25 07:05:39+00:00,csi0g61,3.0,t1_cshmpo4,28674.0,europe

That you shouldn't have lost your temper, but that you are so hurt, for yourself and your family, and wanted this family destruction to stop, that you lost you self control. Promise to work on that in all aspects of your life (a generally useful life skill).

But....

The biggest issue is not if you lost your temper at the other woman. It is that your father is  not handling his affair and her behavior in a way that will end the ongoing damage to your family and allow your family to start to rebuild.  Ask your father to handle this issue and make it 100% clear to this woman that all contact must stop. If she refuses, he needs to pursue a restraining order. The biggest problem is that this damage needs to end, not that you need to find better ways to handle the damage. Only he can do that. If he can't, then the marriage is over and your family will break up. He needs, as the adult and most responsible party, be aware of what the results of his actions are, and be accountable for whatever happens.

1304,"Not true. 

There are two types of cave drawings, or, more accurately, cave paintings, as well as other artwork found in caves -  those that are fairly accurate and appear to document things seen or experienced and creations that are less strictly accurate and serve what appear to be an artistic, decorative and/or religious purpose.

For example, the [lion man of the Hohlenstein Stadel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion_man_of_the_Hohlenstein_Stadel) is the oldest known example of uncontested figurative art. It was found in a cave and is more than 40,000 years old and is associated with the stone age Aurignacian people.  French cave wall painting also show hybrid creatures, although the Lion man is several thousand years older than those French cave artworks. 

Even the oldest piece of art ever found, which predates humans even, may be purely decorative, although it is hard to know for sure. It is a [zigzag pattern carved by Homo Erectus 540,000 years ago](http://news.discovery.com/human/evolution/oldest-art-was-carved-onto-shell-540000-years-ago-141203.htm).

If you count jewelry as art, as it was for decorative adornment and had limited practical purpose, [the oldest examples are 90,000 - 1000,000 years old. They are also from a cave](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/5099104.stm).

There is also uncertainty about what the full purposes of even the most accurate cave painting are. Are they commemorations? Are they religious in some way to encourage future successes? Are they nothing beyond a reflection of what the cave painters were thinking about? You cannot dismiss them as purely practical creations only in place to document events with such confidence, and I'm not aware of any archeologists or historians who do. There just isn't enough evidence form that time about how the people viewed their creations. 

One also could argue that, even if they are practical artworks, even the most representative of the drawings in caves [are still art](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Art#History), and that no distinction between recording through art versus decorating or worship is needed. Both archaeologists and art historians do not require that artworks serve no practical purpose to be considered art. Cave paintings of, say, [a hunt](http://myphototeacher.com/bc/funArt/ArtHistory/1stCavePainting2.jpg) are still art the same way that a Rembrant's group portrait [The Night Watch](http://www.rembrandthuis.nl/media/images/nachtwachtrh.jpeg) or the map frescos of the [map room](https://adventuresincrazytown.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_7428.jpg) in the Doge's Palace are art, even if one also serves the purpose of commemorating a large kill, recording a group's participants or showing the Venetians where their many ships were sailing (and other social purposes as well).",2015-06-24 17:41:58+00:00,csha2cd,4.0,t1_csh3tyq,9295.0,offmychest

1309,"You said you had a rape kit done that showed rape. That is hard evidence for you. You don't have to convince his sobbing audience including everyone to  whom he gives money. You just have to convince a jury. To them, a rich guy trying to avoid responsibility and blame the victim instead could look quite unappealing, especially with the physical evidence and your matching testimony.

The good news is, if he is convicted or not you can still sue for damages in civil court. The threshold for proving his responsibility is lower there (which is how OJ got away without a murder conviction but had to give his victims family most of his remaining fortune).  You can sue your rapist for damages emotional, physical and financial. 

Might I suggest going to your own therapist, or even rape counselor (could be free) and doing some crying of your own? It sounds like you really could use it, and it might counteract some of his of his crying to a mental health professional as a sign of defense.

Or ask him to take a lie detector test. It won't work in court but it may help with your family - if he refuses or if he fails. 

Don't put any posters up saying rapist until he's convicted. Legally you could say he is under investigation for rape, but even then you open yourself to charges of harassment, trespassing, etc. Also, by going after your rapist outside of the courts  you become an aggressor of some type when you want to look 100% like the victim you are. That sounds unfair and it is, but you are in a battle of image as well as fact. Play it strategically.  Continue with the criminal charges. See a lawyer about civil charges too.

1315,"I have a higher degree. In a better topic, from a better university than he had.  And judging by his skills at negotiation that I observed in the office, he did not negotiate much while being hired. Certainly not the 12K USD per annum that he got more than me. 

This was the same office where the same man that gave out unfair salaries also didn't initially select me for additional  media training despite the fact that I give more interviews than anyone else. When I pointed this out, the man who chose the attendees had the grace to admit he was wrong and just ""hadn't thought of you as a media type."" 

Although, this is also the same office that thought that a club with women dancing in small outfits was an appropriate place to hold a major client event (same boss too).

But you're right, there is no way that I would be able to identify actual discrimination in my actual workplace where I actually work every day. Random Internet Guy surely must know better than my angry, ""feminist"" self. Any perceptions that I have of this must be due to my own failings in some way. /s/

But actually, despite all of that, it is most of the time a pretty fair office. Including when they gave me a raise to make up for the discrepancy and then some when I pointed it out how much better I was than the man in question. I also have a new boss in a different now, who seems to be a pretty fair guy.

It isn't nearly like my first employer, which I left as soon as I could (I felt that I had to stay a year for my CV). That place had a very different ""old school"" culture where older, married men tried to date me and expected that I would fix them up with my friends, or demanded that I go out with (or find a date for) a younger guy my own age who was unable to get a date on his own for whatever reason. My opinion or that of my female friends who did not even work there weren't considered that much by those particular guys. Or where I would go to give a talk and they thought I was there to ""support"" the speaker. Or where the boss (who had anger issues not connected to sexism issues, as well as other prejudices like a strong dislike of gay people) would scream at me and other female employees, but never the males. But I probably misunderstood those with my weak lady brain too.

I've also worked somewhere where discrimination did not seem like a real issue at all. Including my current department at my multinational employer.

The issue is not if I was paid less than I deserved and a man was paid more than he deserved at my job in my own case. It is not if you worked harder than an ex and she unreasonably expected a similar income. It is that examples of discrimination exist. False perceptions of discrimination exist. Taken individually they are only anecdotes that can't tell us much about what is happening in a society as a whole. Fortunately, there is a very large sample of literally hundreds of millions of workers that we can look at to see if, overall, wage discrimination exists. And it does. Even if it doesn't for every person at every employer in every industry in every situation at every time of their life.

Thirteen. Out of 26. Half.

Another thirteen are about rape (with some overlap with women). The rape issues can be broken down into rape of men, statutory rape by older women, false rape accusations against men reported by women and one article critical of segregating rapists and other ex offenders in prison on the grounds that it stigmatizes them unjustly.

Only four of the 26  (so 15%) are not about women, rape or both. They are about discrimination against men in some form.

There is one post among those four that partially does address an other men's issue, albeit from a discrimination perspective. The headline claims that some poor fathers give goods instead of money as child support, but are branded deadbeat because they don't give money they are legally required to. 

None of the issues mentioned by OP - PTSD, prostate cancer, boys falling behind in school, or other issues that men face are currently on the front page of r/mensrights. It isn't 100% obsessed with women, but it is overly so, and does not display a strong interest in the many issues that men face.
