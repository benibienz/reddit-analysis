The blinds that came with the place are not attractive, nor do they do nearly enough to keep out the piercing morning light. The arches on top make internal blinds difficult, yet I hate the idea of cluttering up a relatively small room with large curtains, or simply hanging roller shade right on the wall. I thought about a large curtain hanging from near the ceiling (there is a wardrobe to the right behind which it can be partially hidden when pulled back), but I can't find a bar or wire form which to hang it that doesn't look like cheap clutter. At this point I'm ready to have an ugly bedroom if it means sleeping past 5:30am, but I didn't want to give up hope without asking the experts here. Any advice on options or products would be greatly appreciated.

Please forgive my ignorance, but we just arrived in Lisbon and everywhere we look there are preparations for a coming holiday - streamers, bars, outside terraces, something big is coming.
But we don't know what! I'd guess Portugal Day, but that isn't for another two weeks and a lot of these decorations look pretty advanced.

Thank you.

Edit: Thank you for your answers, I agree, it does look fun!

No one ever figured out exactly what I had, but I was sick for a while and one of the fun results is that my immune system went a little crazy and I now appear to be allergic to everything, including most common vegan foods. Gives me asthma type allergic reaction, so not fun. 

As a result, I'm at a loss of what to eat. If I have to eat only quinoa and hummus until I die I will be most unhappy. Already the doctor suggested that I consider eating animals but I don't want to violate my beliefs just to get some nutrition. 

I therefore ask you for any and all suggestions of tasty things that I can est and still be healthy without turning to animals. Any suggestions are much appreciated.

The lis of verboten foods includes:

* Soy
* Almonds
* Peanuts
* Oats
* Rice
* Coconut
* Peas
* Grapefruit
* Lemon
* Eggplant
* Watermelon
* Butternut squash 
* Carrots
* Broccoli
* Kale
* Swiss chard
* Pears
* Apples
* Watermelon
* Cucumber 

(I also tested allergic to dairy but I care less about that at the moment. Fortunately cashews and hemp milk are OK so I do buy the one cashew hard cheese in my neighboring store and hemp milk).
