11,"**DMP** when we get into specific champions, yes some do not need it... but for overall tanks, I love it

**Abyssal + Moonflair** I can see tanky APs only if you go full bruiser AP, like Rylais+Abyssal+Flair etc. It all ties into kill pressure:tankiness ratios. If your kill pressure is low because you only have 1 AP item, then one side of your ratio is basically worthless, but if you fully commit to having a worthy amount of dmg, then having AP is useful. But Abyssal into tank? or Moonflair with tank? your AP ratios become useless because your not actually dealing dmg to anyone over 30 MR

**Sunfire cape** alright I actually get outnumbered every time I preach this, but I think it's good on quite a few champs. Rammus 10/10. Bot lane Garen and Malphite 8/10. Leona 7/10. New Shen prob idk. Mundo and amumu 4/10, meaning viable if you can really stick onto the enemy teams

so I do think sunfire is really up to the individual, which makes most of our arguement over whether MR itemization is better than Armor itemization",2016-02-06 17:54:51+00:00,czq5o2m,6,t1_czq3yr8,2993,LoLDominion
12,"I realized we had to make a bunch of assumptions based on different tanks, so I'm going to assume the role of the only tank and there are 3 other squishies on my team. There's a whole bunch of other things like AD and AP tanks, but that doesnt matter to me

**DMP** it's not that the slow doesn't matter on tanks, it matters on who you use it on. Immobile carries get rekt by the 75% slow because it allows almost every tank to be able to sit ontop of them, and force massive peel. Using it against like a Quinn, and you won't get too much out of the slow. But even then, the speed boost can't really be stopped because it fulfills one purpose: the engage at the beginning of the fight. Better engages mean you take less initial damage in the outset of the fight

**Abyssal Scepter + Moonflair Spellblade** the AP and mpen are worthless if you don't have any kill pressure. Granted one thing, if they have 30 MR and you can get ontop of them, your kill pressure goes up heavily, but all of that is easily countered by any 1 MR item, and as an ADC thats super easy: hexdrinker or quicksilver sash. APs have a harder time, but are also more likely to be able to kite you anyways so your going to have a harder time getting onto them.

**Solari** takes some time to get the gold investment in. So where you could have been tanky earlier with spectres cowl and helped win earlier fights, your now having a minor tear effect and going for a mid game spike. Your also personally weaker, so you as a tank are also more limited in how much you can do. I know your team gets more power, but I uh, never rely on my team in NA. I guess your normal games are more balanced, but from where Im from, the MMR system is basically like ""Ok mr high elo, your team is the bad team every game, their team is always going to be stronger than your team"" :&gt; i love NA",2016-02-06 16:46:57+00:00,czq3cq2,4,t1_czpz11z,9285,LoLDominion
13,"Try to engage in a way that forces an AD to deal with you, while avoiding the mages. Let your team deal with the mages, that way you can stack armor.

A slow in general is obviously good for kiting. A long range slow can be used to start a pick-style-engage on whoever you slow, or to delay their engage.

Oh, and the former isn't necessarily hard engage by itself, you would need follow up.

You can wait to use your slow when practically everyone is right next to you, so they can follow up on your slow, whereas a long range slow might be too far for them to follow up. That would be hard engage.

Midfight, a slow can be used to reduce dmg to you. Simply slow them, and kite out of range. You would probably have to reengage, but still useful in some situations (like when you cant tank everything).",2015-10-28 01:16:25+00:00,cwfcdzn,3,t1_cwfa1c9,3548,LoLDominion

Basics: stay in the jungle and get control of the middle area of the map. That way, you can have 1 person acts as a semi-brush ward defending 2 turrets for a short while until you have an idea of where most of the enemies are. 
From there, I have a flow chart: If shaco appears bot, head over there.
If Shaco appears nearby, chase him off and have somebody stay in the area for a short while. Which is probably you. Now lets say your the carry for your team, and nobody else can deal with shaco, then you need to force a fight elsewhere and win, so you can get a turret to make up for the one shaco took (and some kills ofcourse). If you can't win, then clearly your not the carry, just a guy who built damage, so go back to camping shaco.

That probably sounds hard to picture exactly whats happening, but even if somebody made a video with every detail, that won't work either because people need mechanics first and foremost. Can't teach strategy to people who don't have proper mechanics, so you might want to work on those first.

Imagine it like this: Cider + Tanky items = decent jungle clear speed and little combat dmg but more tankiness. Trade off is Runeglaive Sunfire, really high jg clear speed and somewhat better combat dmg, but less tankiness. Food for thought is: Do you need to be that tanky? or if you max W, does that make you tanky enough to pick up some damage?",2015-09-28 19:17:57+00:00,cvh7co5,3,t1_cvh5609,3163,summonerschool

If he gets it off successfully, ie gets your flash for free, you laned wrong, so fix your lane positioning and W placement. If he flashes onto you after that, flash his flash, dont even hesitate, prepare for it because once he does that first gank, it sort of NEEDS to work, so I would always expect him to flash. In theory, he can get back into game after a fail first gank, but its hard. After a bad early game, he won't be able to tower dive you anymore.
