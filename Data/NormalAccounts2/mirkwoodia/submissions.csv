I think plenty of us have had fairly lengthy q times, sometimes going beyond 30 min. It's soul crushing when a friend skips me up in q, because that means I would have to wait another 20min for their game. 

I don't know if people mind this. The cons: More imbalanced games when higher elo players play against lower players. The pros: shorter queue times. I personally prefer that, but maybe there's another side ?

edit: I will add that from my perspective, a lot of good players are already being mixed with lower players, and you can often tell just how distinct the difference is. So the concept isn't something new really.

2nd edit: Initial feedback seems positive, so Ima try taking this to uh... these guys...

Alright you know the drill, follow and subscribe! I really think, if you guys want a community, we can't build it around DD anymore, so my idea is to rebuild it around multiple things, and get more of an active interest in dominion. Preseason, we might get some people coming back over from SR, so there's always that possibility that we can get Dom tournys back up if we can get a better community

Alright edit: I'm shooting in the dark, so if anybody has special requests (more montages and music videos, Tips and Tricks, How to beat Shaco backdoor???) go ahead and I can easily give it priority",LoLDominion,Mirk's Youtube+plays.tv channel,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoLDominion/comments/3pjir7/mirks_youtubeplaystv_channel/

If I could summarize every Dominion game, it would be Rotations and Fighting, same thing, every time. Another issue is map-specific balancing. It's not about balance, but encouraging diversity. We don't have a sort of combat-triangle between ADC's, Tanks, and Mages. Obviously what's missing: ADCs

So my obvious solution would be to fix ADC's, and that would in turn drastically change the way we fight. The Map-specific balancing that I have in mind for them is to take each champ's strengths and weaknesses that allow them to be viable...

Ashe: Decrease Ult CD
Draven: Increase ""catch radius"" of fallen axes.
Sivir: Increase duration of spell-shield to 3sec
Everyone else: etc

I know we have another bigger fundamental issue: Riot doesn't even give us attention in the first place. I doubt they ever will though, but if anyone wants to try, this is probably one issue for the future.",LoLDominion,Why Dominion has no future,http://www.reddit.com/r/LoLDominion/comments/3bkhrm/why_dominion_has_no_future/
