28,"So where's the replacement in any form? They've shown they caught up on the fixes and launches for new countries but are focusing development time on other things. They disabled the steps because of performance issues at launch, they removed they visual spawn areas from beta, they rotate nests seemingly on whims, they hid spawns while moving, they've made detrimental changes to the performance to try and block maps in an ongoing war against them. All of this shows a commitment to have players in the dark on where to find Pokemon, the more you play go the more it feels niantic never has. 

How many times have we seen developers fight a war against hackers and home developers? Do they ever, ever win?

134,"Ok here goes.
I grew up a cowboys fan because kids make dumb decisions and they were superbowl champions. Eventually I stopped watching football since I didn't really understand or care about it. 10ish years later a friend introduced me to fantasy football which I realized is just Pokémon for jocks and I loved it, I didn't know who anyone was and remember being really confused when they explained what a tight end was (bastards watched me draft Aaron Hernandez) now I'm hooked and play at least 3 leagues a year but... I can't pick a team. 
I'm an adult now so I don't have to pick the cowboys, my SO is a 49ers fan so I can't go there either.

No home team in my state, I like the idea of the Seahawks with their location, fans, Lynch was hilarious last year, and I was reading about their rugby tackling techniques... But way to bandwagon, so what about my bestie he likes Green bay and they have a cool list of QBs and being city owned is cool but their field sucks, their green colour is meh and again bandwagon.
 Maybe the Vikings because vikings are cool but AP beats his kids, at this point I realize I'm putting way too much thought into it and the only thing I know for sure it's fuck the Patriots.
