Example 2 phones were level 20 and every single Pokemon we found had the exact same cp level which were different than my brother's phone who was level 16.
Sometimes his would be higher level while most of the times ours would be.

Edit: This is not about spawning higher level cp pokemon with higher trainer levels but that the cp bar is set randomly for every trainer level when they spawn.",pokemongo,Wild encounter CP levels set by trainer level,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/4tnfam/wild_encounter_cp_levels_set_by_trainer_level/
