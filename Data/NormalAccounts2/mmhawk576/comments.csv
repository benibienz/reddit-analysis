She said there was panic in the cabin for several minutes, but after that there was just calm. People were terrified, but knew they were helpless. The aircraft glided with no engines running for a total of 13 minutes, after which the pilots managed to get one engine running at last, and safely land the plane at Jakarta airport.

52,"I think the core thing that I have learnt in my 1100 hours of Solo Queue, is that you just have to play Mr. Nice Guy with your team almost always. 

Cooperation is a core component of CSGO, and if your team starts to break down, because you decided that their decision wasn't the best, and did your own thing, they'll listen to you less during the game. One thing that I do, is always try to pose my ideas as questions. Such as, ""How about we eco this one so we can buy next?"". That way in your team's mind, It was always them that had the final call, they won't be angry, and will continue listening. 

You also have to play with the expectation of a lack of communication, and use all of your utilities such as sound and minimap to give yourself the best awareness for situations. If someone died in a location, and then the same enemy kills you, the one thing you CANNOT do in solo queue is blame your teammate. I know, it was their fault, but they do NOT want to know it. Unfortunately you have have to make yourself aware of the enemies in solo queue. To win in Solo queue, you need to do everything you can to be at the best of your abilities, with zero dependance on others. In saying that, don't be the guy that buy's awps while your team in on pistols. Maybe you could buy a cheap SMG instead of a pistol, and not lose much, The kill bonus helps this. But play according to your teams decisions, and support them. 

Solo queue is a exciting beast, and is honestly where I have my most fun. It's so much more satisfying to me at least, making huge plays, without the support you would normally expect. Good luck on your endeavors, and become the #1 Solo Queue hero.",2016-07-15 02:06:07+00:00,d5csugw,2.0,t1_d5cdn6m,22632.0,GlobalOffensive
53,"Crosshair placement is something that advice can't teach. You just need to get into the habit of pulling the crosshair up a bit further, and having it on the corner that you are peaking. 

As for clutch situations, the trick is to make sure that you do every thing you can to turn the 1vX clutch into X * 1v1 battles. Be aware of how long you have to perform the clutch, Am I a CT going for a 3v1 clutch with bomb already down? As a T, you may have more time to work with, and can play quietly to catch opponents of guard. Peek angles where you only become visible to one opponent at a time. D2 short for example, Peek site slowly so you can check Goose, without a player at box seeing you. Then peek boxs, from left to right. You need to think, every single time, before you peek a new angle, Can I finish this clutch? Will I have time to defuse? Can I afford to lose my weapon? Sometimes clutches are just not suppose to be taken. 

One last thing that I swear more people I play with need to be aware of is timings. If I have just left a position, How long do I have until I can't be sure behind me is safe anymore. How long could it take for an enemy to flank me. If winning a fight on a particular angle is taking too long, maybe it's time to retreat, and save the weapon. This timing knowledge is definitely not exclusive to clutch situations however.

Confidence will come, not just from making an amazing clutch, but just knowing that you made the right decision for the situation. So go forth and clutch! or not, depending on the situation, and good luck with your battles, my friend!",2016-07-15 00:23:41+00:00,d5cp5b9,2.0,t1_d5chri3,11016.0,GlobalOffensive

I'm not sure on how much it really effects my gamely as I've always played on this machine. 
But I know the source engine has input delay that is relative to your framerate. I dunno the math for 120 frames, but at 60 frames, I believe there's the potential of up to 11milliseconds of delay before your input is registered, plus another 60, and then another 11milliseconds for.it to be render. Whereas when I'm at 300, that delay is 3milliseconds for input, then 3 to render. 

This in most situations isn't huge, but it's always nice reducing the latency between your actions and the game responding

156,"I think cache is played in a manner where cts regularly consider A site to be the secondary site. I see it played with just 1 a, 2 mid, and 2b, because B has a much harder retake. When it comes to map design, it is crucial for the to be a clear primary and secondary site. Look at a few maps and you find that although alot of maps have two entrances on their secondary site, mid control is normally required for one of those entrances. The problem with all the changes that people have been suggesting with inferno is that they forget to consider B as a secondary bombsite. 

This is also beside the fact that I find inferno to play very well. Banana is such a confined space that it becomes easy to take, the use of HE grenades, Incendiaries and smoke grenades quickly clear out CTs, and smokes on site make the take reasonably trivial. Another play that is often forgetten about is smoking B site and rotating through CT it keeps the opposition questioning where you're going",2015-08-14 09:35:24+00:00,cu2m04o,4.0,t1_cu1w7sn,52569.0,GlobalOffensive
