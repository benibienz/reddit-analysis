I just finished play a game, and I watched the demo to check out some plays. There was a weird issue I saw with only one player, where the player's name never showed up in the kill feed when he was fragged, And when ever he killed a player, the player that died showed up in the kill feed as having suicided.

I have never seen this before, and curious to see if you guys have any ideas?",GlobalOffensive,Why does a players frags show up as the enemy suiciding?,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/4sycd9/why_does_a_players_frags_show_up_as_the_enemy/
