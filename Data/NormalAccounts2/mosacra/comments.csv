1,"Was reading this and somewhere in the tutu story I thought to myself, ""This sounds like a fellow Louisianan."" Then I saw the bit about the crawfish boil and your username. ",2016-10-24 19:33:13+00:00,d9605yd,5,t1_d95smv7,9069,AskReddit
2,"I was working during the first half of his game against the Steelers and on the first play I saw when I got home, I could've sworn he got burned by about four feet while covering Antonio Brown. Can't remember if Antonio got the ball on that play so it might not apply to this statistic but I really don't see him living up to the ridiculous amount of hype this sub is giving him.",2016-09-20 04:27:38+00:00,d7u6zoo,1,t3_53jope,28049,nfl

9,I know I'm setting myself up for disappointment but I hopefully expect we do something similar to what the Panthers did last year in terms of making a huge comeback. Doubt we'll go almost undefeated but I would at least hope we're seen as a contender again before Drew retires in a few years. ,2016-06-13 19:01:54+00:00,d47oc7f,2,t1_d47f35e,11699,Saints

14,"This past year. Saints vs Giants. November 1st.

I've been a Saints fan since birth but I've never been able to go to a game. Went for my first game. Stayed to see Drew Brees break records and also to see who would win because the Giants had a record game too and it ended in an All Saints Day walkoff field goal. God I love football but i swear my hair turned colors during that game. ",2016-03-14 00:49:48+00:00,d0yt4cp,1,t3_4a9v8e,15617,nfl

16,"Sitting in a Catholic school service type thing in the auditorium. They were playing Christian choir music and showing a slideshow of Christian images. My best friend and i were sitting next to each other when a photo of Mother Teresa inches away from devouring a small child appeared. We lost our goddamn minds in the middle of the gym.

18,"Was in the same place as you for the past 6 months with my girlfriend of 2.5 years. We actually decided to break up two weeks ago when neither of us could take it anymore. We tried to make it work for a while but breaking up ended up being being the best option for us. I still love her and miss having my co-pilot through life, but I am excited to be able to be my own person. I'm also happy that neither of us have to worry about the fighting and the constant let downs by us both. Not going to lie, it has been pretty hard on me, but I hope that I can come out of it as a better and happier person. I hope all ends well for you. Definitely try to make it work because even if there's a chance of complete happiness with that person you have to try. And really open yourself to trying instead of saying you will and doing nothing. That's one of the mistakes I made. Just gotta remember to compromise to make the other person happy but also make sure you're enjoying making them happy. If not then maybe it's time for a change. Best of luck, though, you can get through this.",2015-10-28 08:35:55+00:00,cwfof6i,2,t1_cwepbwl,59558,AskReddit
