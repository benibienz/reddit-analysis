You can't flank the AI on your own. If there isn't another player in your party to pull the aggro, the AI pretty much always knows where you are, no matter how well you hide behind covers to move around them. 

Even worse is the blizzard condition. Not only you get total visual obstruction but also your reticle doesn't change color when it's on enemy targets within regular range. So you get a mechanical reduction to your range of vision but miraculously the AI immediately notices you, even turns around and starts shooting at you from a cloud of snow. 

If they stripped the AI of their precognitive abilities and put you on equal threat detection levels, the game would be much more tactically realistic and rewarding. Thus far, this is my only complaint regarding the AI. Apart from this, I totally agree that it's one of the best in the genre.",2016-03-18 09:13:53+00:00,d14bsbr,1.0,t3_4avfsl,39365,thedivision

46,"You are totally correct that it SHOULD be a great risk. It isn't a dedicated pvp zone either. And that's probably why many people bought the game anyway. You've explained what it was meant to be, explained it good, but it isn't the way it's meant to be at the moment.

Here's why: LOOT SHOULD BE DROPPED, NOT BOUGHT! This is the main problem that isn't voiced often enough because pvp hungry migrants from CoD and the like are whining about not being able to pvp as safely as they want. Sadly, this masks the actual big mistake Massive has made. And there's no excuse because they have Diablo III and Destiny to learn from.

Blizzard had to get rid of the AH system, but it wasn't because some people paid money to get good gear and others whined. That was not the point since it doesn't have pvp. The problem was that the hunt for loot was the driving factor behind that game's design. And being able to cash in and buy loot instead of seeing the sweet pillar of light and wishing for a good legendary simply meant that people didn't bother and couldn't enjoy the game as they should. That's what Massive needs to fix.

So far, we can buy every single piece of HE gear with PXC and that is ridiculous. DZ drops are ridiculous as well. There shouldn't be any blue drops, there should be more yellow drops and if not all, a vast majority of yellows should be EXCLUSIVE to loot drops. Thus slowing the insane progression speed to keep boredom in check, making pve much more rewarding and exciting and last but not least, giving a solid incentive for going rogue as you MUST get loot drops to get the best gear instead of simple PXC farming. That way, people will have a much better chance of going rogue when they see someone kill a named enemy because there's a chance of getting a loot exclusive item.

This is really simple. If you let people buy everything with some grinding, there won't be any incentive for decent pve and/or going rogue. Fix that and the DZ will become a much more thrilling/rewarding experience.",2016-03-15 18:27:02+00:00,d10wjgu,1.0,t3_4aieic,18311,thedivision
47,"I think the actual problem is not risk but reward. Massive needs to understand that loot is not sold, it is dropped. People already complain about low phoenix drops but if it was higher, you'd get full gear in just a week. And what will you do then? The best gear in the game should be unobtainable from stores and it should only come as a loot drop. Therefore people will actually have to drop that loot themselves or kill to get the best gear, thus increasing the number of rogue agents. I think the moment you decrease the risks, it will be just like DayZ and people will camp around extraction zones. The only reason that the Dark Zone has some ""tension"" is because you're never sure that it's a simple pvp warzone and you don't dare disrupt the peace unless you're very confident of your chances of survival on a manhunt",2016-03-15 10:25:08+00:00,d10gkig,1.0,t3_4afgu8,43254,thedivision

59,"I think any deeper conspiracy would be disappointing to be honest. It's about the man, his conflicts and his unexpected friend/flirt. Adding another human drama which is related to his friend nails it imho. The fact that the cheerful Delilah turns into a cold, distant woman after finding out about the little kid is so powerful. Henry will probably always remind her of the kid and her guilt at not telling anything to the cops so that's why she's giving up on him.

Overall, the anti-climactic ending is brilliant. This game is about a slice of life, real pain and conflicts. It is about people and their interaction. And our lives are mostly only build-up with no payoff. I think that's where Firewatch shines. It's believable and relatable despite the murder mystery and the wilderness.

Thanks for the information. I didn't mean to call the writer out, I was just giving an example and wasn't exactly blaming. Perhaps the writer is sick or maybe dead, which is sad and scary who knows. :/ I get your point and I've edited.

As for  the series parts rule, I couldn't find it under author posting guidelines neither under the ""Series Posts"" sub-header there. It says that titles should include (Part 1) etc. but nothing about the actual posts or at least a comment on each post. If it's indeed a rule, maybe it should be better represented there because some authors might not be aware as well. That may help improve the situation.

68,"Thanks for another nice reply.

The way I see it, the only reason major networks are one by one offering on-demand video services is because the ""Hey I'll broadcast this pre-recorded content on the day and at the hour I like because f u"" way of broadcasting is doomed to die with the generations that didn't have the ""on-demand"" option. I may be wrong but if I'm wrong, I would be baffled quite honestly. Why put up with the stress of being at home, in front of the tv to ""enjoy"" content when you can see it at your leisure? That's the way I see it and maybe, due to the nice financial points you've made, the industry may stagger and indies could get more attention who knows.

And to support my comments on the death of traditional TV, just look at some TV viewing numbers of famous shows from a decade ago. Compare X-Files and Game of Thrones for example. Two global phenomena, the latter of which caught the wind of the hype machine known as the internet. So if TV was as strong as ever, with the hype generated by the internet, GoT should have been viewed much more but X-Files triples it. TRIPLES IT and I find that very interesting. You seem to know your way around these issues and I'm (humbly) wise enough to know that correlation does not necessarily imply causation so if you can explain those numbers in a way in which traditional TV isn't in a major decline then I'm honestly very interested to hear your thoughts on it. :)

69,"Fair points but I was talking about piracy when I mentioned prices. Cops never show up at your doorstep here but I still want to pay for the content if Netflix can provide. 

And again, foreign productions are watched by a well-educated group of people here and most of them already use illegal streaming sites to watch TV shows and use the obvious for movies. Netflix can change that since it can get much more visibility and sub revenue via those shows/movies then the couple TV channels and thus pay more or at least the same to the IP owners should they want to.

I know that TV is still big in the states but I think we can all agree that it's dying. It's only a matter of time before local ""online streaming"" deals take the place of TV rights and hopefully followed by global networks that provide content online. 

I mean I'm guessing that the number of albums being sold is lower than it was years back now that people can use Spotify or similar services, even YouTube if they want to go completely free.

As for the DLP DC, I think someone actually kind of made that work, if you mean a libero, but that's a bit tough. Or maybe push insanely high and play a slow passing game so your team gets comfortable in the opposition half, then instead of the midfielder falling back to distribute passes from around the center of the pitch, your defender can.

I do understand you, but like I said, it can be done with player instructions far better. Now the player instructions are much more visible when you select a role and the obvious permanent instructions on an IF suggest that it would act like an AML anyway. That's why I said it shouldn't let you play an ML as an IF because he wouldn't track back with his permanent player instructions and kill the whole purpose of the ML anyway.

So forgive me but I'd call it an improvement. They should however add something like the inverted wing back to have ML's cut inside a bit more, though not as offensively.

108,"1) Are there any plans to implement **external youth academies**? Like a **European club having an academy in Brazil** or something like that? I'm pretty sure that's done in real life, I know that some European clubs for example, trials and youth intakes from independent academies in Turkey via deals with them. And clubs can have ""football schools"" all around so I think that would be a wonderful addition to FM. It would increase depth, reality and the options we have when running a club.

2) Would you consider to implement the streamlining options of FM Touch to the full simulation mode as gameplay options to help those players who want an experience in between the two of them? One huge necessity imho is the instant result button, which is added via skins but I'm sure you can have a better working implementation.

3) Many people considered multiple set-piece routines to be an essential and pretty straightforward addition that FM needed and some of its competition have had for a very long time. Is there any particular reason that it took so long to deliver? Was it far behind on the pipeline for some reason or were there technical issues like overall processing power of computers? Your competitors may have had it but they lacked the depth and realism of FM so it might not be the same for you, performance-wise. Just guessing.

4) I think there can be many improvements to the Turkish translation of the game. Especially the position names are awful imho. They are word to word translations and they clog the UI with awfully long abbreviations due to awfully long names. The actual position names that are being and have been used in Turkish football and media for decades are much intuitive, shorter and thus easier on the eye. Plus, they would make the game feel much more authentic. Any chance I could somehow send you a list of those and you could share it with your translations team? I'm a professional translator too by the way so I know that there might be syntax issues with the game's code. Perhaps that's why they were translated like that. But if not, I really think it can improve.

I'm a veteran of the game and I always had big success with scouting but I can't seem to find players from Africa and Asia. Not nearly as much as it should be compared to real life. And when I do, they seem to always be from the loaded leagues I have, which isn't much with SI's default leagues.

So should I completely ignore Africa and Asia while scouting? Can my scouts find players from inactive leagues? Or leagues that aren't in the game at all? 

For example, if I scout Nigeria, would my scouts find some talent or just waste time because there isn't a league etc. ?

I personally liked to believe that ""talent"" doesn't exist but delving into youth development in football changed that for me.

What is reflected in-game by reports is the ""talent"" value and the probability of the player reaching that value. If you max everyone's PA, then high ambition - professionalism + determination (bonus) players at good youth academies would all become superstars in the game.

jumping reach = how high the player can ""reach"" so if a 180 player and 185 player both have 14 jjumping reach, they will reach the same height in game. And their heading, str stats will determine the outcome. Plus RNG I suppose.

As for what height does, height affects the min and max levels of jumping reach a player can has. And how much it can grow since it affects the ""max"" level.

1) People want to know the gender of a person that they're going to talk to. Not necessarily for romantic or sexting reasons. I think it's quite normal. Someone may have lots of same sex friends and could look for friends from the opposite sex. Or vice versa as I've seen quite a few ladies looking for female friends who could understand them better, etc. 

The above is an opinion but I believe there is a fact which will be far worse than the way it is now. People will still want to know the person's gender and if you don't let them share it start sending ASL pm's which is NOT good. Think about it :)

2) The second point is that I don't think this is a conversation sub. It's called ""need a friend"" and we're looking for new friends. So it's quite normal that we prefer texting, skype or simply reddit pm's to communicate. As this is a people finder sub, rather than an open conversation sub, having a concern about ""too few comments"" seems moot to me. Just something to think about.

The reason is that there are TONS of ""decent"" SCP articles on the site and if you read the top rated articles first, you'll become disillusioned with the rest of the site imho. Plus, reading through decent articles and stumbling on stars of the site on the road makes those top rated articles much more satisfying to read, without ruining the decent ones which are naturally the vast majority of the content.

I've started from SCP 002 and I'm reading in numerical order. Which is not really recommended but due to the reasons that I've stated above, it works great for me. I'm pretty sure if I've read only the best ones at first, the rest of the articles wouldn't achieve the same heights that they would reach independently :/",2015-08-11 10:28:48+00:00,ctz04l8,1.0,t3_3gjwh4,22922,SCP

176,"Never happened to me with any single game. This is obviously their fault, and I'm a happy little BioWare fanboy lol but I can accept their mistakes and criticize them, you know, like grown ups do. The actual sad thing is the speed of my download but I guess I'll be able to play it in 2 hours. When I download a game from Steam, I download with a sspeed of 10mbs/s. Now with this, it varies between 200kbs and 1mbs :(",2015-06-23 19:31:11+00:00,csg8hh2,8.0,t1_csg8b6i,258,swtor

178,"How exactly is it common sense? There is no way I could know that the game would try to redownload itself. As a matter of fact, I didn't even try to download the patch. There is no option on the launcher that says ""always keep the game up to date"". But it still decided to download when I opened the launcher. I'm sorry for opening the launcher and hurting your loving feelings about BioWare, but this is NOT a common sense issue. This is a lack of information issue and a common sense issue on their side for not blocking the patching servers when it's causing nonsense like this

PS: I love BioWare as much as I do, doesn't mean they are immune to criticism.",2015-06-23 18:28:29+00:00,csg5xru,4.0,t1_csg5gbg,718,swtor
179,"You really should have let us know before. Now I'm downloading 25gbs of game data with 600kb/s even though I have a perfectly working 100mbit internet connection. Just for a teeny tiny patch... You guys are unbelievable. And fyi, instead of telling people to not try to download the patch before the maintenance, just block patch server access to players while you work? So we don't suffer like this. I hope your bandwidth load decreases so I can get a decent download rate. I'm literally varying between 300kb and 800kb.

182,"I see, thanks. Now I wish I've left my pc on for the patch before going to bed. This is ridiculous though. I mean why can't they literally ""patch"" the game? It's the same with most MMO's. Huge downloads when a patch comes out. But I play tons of games on Steam too for example and they never make you re-download, they actually ""patch"". I wonder what is so different about MMO's, from a software point, that they can't patch it :/",2015-06-23 12:02:13+00:00,csfsru2,3.0,t1_csfsqfp,114,swtor
183,"I've started the game a week ago. Now is it normal for a patch to be 10 gigs? Also I've downloaded the base game with about 5mb/s average speed, now I'm at 650k/s which is pretty annoying. That size? And that speed? Can there be something wrong with my game or is it normal for these updates to be so extremely huge? The game was already 26gigs on disk, so now it'll be about 40?",2015-06-23 11:55:21+00:00,csfsmx9,1.0,t3_3atdw1,4882,swtor
