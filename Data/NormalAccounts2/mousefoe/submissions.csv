I'm playing the latest version of Crash Landing. I'm having a problem and I couldn't find the culprit in the config files. When I suffer from heatstroke and hunger together, I can't eat. I hold the right mouse button but nothing happens. Then I die of hunger, which is frustrating.

As far as I can remember the effects list had hunger, mining fatigue, something relevant like that and heat stroke. 

So does anybody know how to get rid of that? Which config file maybe?

So is this a bug? Should they be scannable or is the fact that there is a red dot under them is a bug?

I'm playing in Ireland and I've formed the Kingdom of Eire. After that, I've conquered a few counties in Britain. Later on, there was a revolt in Ireland, I've crushed it and after a few minutes I've noticed that an English duke is running it. I've lost land without noticing and the revolt wasn't an English revolt anyway.

I've claimed my de jure when England was busy with war, took it back all is nice. Then I had to deal with another revolt for my tyranny by a duchess of mine. I've crushed it and guess what, one of the two counties of her was now English. 

What's more annoying is that the English dude keeps sending me plot invites to claim the Duchy of Mumu, which is in my own kingdom! Why would I give it to you if you're a vassal of another kingdom?

So I'm really confused. How can I avoid England from taking my land after I crush a totally unrelated revolt? I've made my way from a single town to a kingdom and they were already a kingdom so they are powerful. I'm still managing well but then this happens. Please help :(

I know this must get boring and I've done some research, including your own guide to the comic universe but I still have some questions if you don't mind answering. First of all, I'm mainly concerned about Earth 616 because aside from crossovers, this multiverse thing sounds intimidatingly confusing. But I'll try my best of course because the MCU revived my interest in Marvel after a childhood of Spiderman and X-Men cartoons. Anyway, here are my questions:

1) In the faq, there's only a list of essential reading for various major events and characters. What I need is an actual reading order. Tons of different arcs and tons of ""issue#1""s are too confusing for me so I'd rather be a sheep and follow orders instead of messing around myself. Like I said, intimidating. So would [the reading order at the Marvel wiki](http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Marvel_Universe_Reading_Order) help me? Is it good? Bad? Why? :)

2) What alternative reading order would you recommend? I prefer to learn the whole continuity so I'm willing to include anything, starting from 1939. I've found many guides that start from the 90s but I think that may leave out a whole lot of Marvel universe lore unread. I want to do this right. So I'd appreciate any input.

3) Finally, how good is Marvel Unlimited? I live in Turkey so it's almost impossible for me to buy print copies, not at least without paying insane amounts of international shipping. Marvel Unlimited looks great, and I think it has around 17000 comics for subscribers and new ones are added after half a year or so. Would you recommend it to me? I'm guessing since 99% of my reading will be from very old issues, they must be among those 17000 but it never hurts to ask. What other methods do I have to read them? Which one would you recommend?

I know that some people dislike folks like me who ask but I honestly did some research and I'd rather get real opinions from genuine people instead of blindly trusting a random website. So I'm humbly asking for advice from you Marvel fans. :)

Does anyone know how the game decides televised matches? Right now I've made it into the Premier League and I see only 2 matches out of 8 in this match day being televised. However, even from Turkey, I can watch more games in one day from Premier League. Aren't all the games televised nowadays? 

I mean if you have two games at the same time you can do Sky1 Sky2 etc. and broadcast them all? Same thing in Turkey too. In Turkey, every single match is televised from SÃ¼per Lig but I find that it's not always the case in game. That sadly results in huge and unrealistic TV rights losses. Totally ridiculous.

I apologize for another recommendation thread though it makes sense to ask people with similar interests after all. Goodreads was helpful but I'd rather have redittors' input on this.

So I'm looking for awe inspiring and thought provoking sci-fi novels with some focus on exploration. I'm a huge fan of the Space Odyssey by Arthur C. Clarke, also Rendezvous With Rama (though I couldn't read the rest since the writing tone was different with Gentry Lee on board) and The City and the Stars which are all very thought provoking novels with lots of exploration. I'm looking for a similar taste. Instead of war focused sci-fi series, I'm looking for new civilizations, ruins, explorations, delving deep into human nature or even questioning what it means to be human or perhaps simply alive. 

Please don't recommend anything from Asimov, Clarke or Card since I'm familiar with them already. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy as well, which has too much humor imho to fit into this category. It's great anyway, just not the taste I'm looking for. I'm interested in more modern writers. I'll read The Three Body Problem series once it's done. And I really prefer finished series since I have this phobia of getting too attached to a series and the author simply dies before completing it. 

So this was long and I certainly sound spoiled but I'm looking for just that kind of fiction. Less violence, more exploration and discovery. Any recommendations are appreciated.

I'm sorry if this has been discussed before, I merely read the stories and I had some serious displeasure due to some series posts and I wanted to express myself and maybe hear out the mods' thoughts on these issues.

I don't have as much time as I used to have to read nosleep everyday/week etc. and I try to at least read the monthly winners. The most recent problem I had with that was that a ""series"" post was that one such post was featured in September 2015 and it still doesn't have a part 2. It's a 4 month old ""series"" post and I really think that mods, or whoever decides the top content, should not feature an unfinished story.

I understand that authors want some interaction when they are writing a series and I enjoy reading that as well. I also understand that people may have private issues etc. that prevent them from writing but as I've said, featuring a series post which is incomplete is counterproductive imho.

My second and perhaps more objective issue is that there should be better regulation regarding series posts. I've noticed that there is a bot now but I've also noticed that it doesn't work properly, doesn't update it's post to reflect additional entries of that series. I think that a series author has a responsibility towards the reader and should update at least the OP with links to every other part of the story. Yes, it may disrupt the experience if it was in the post itself so people may want to avoid that but they could have a comment to update. And yes, we can check their profiles to see but some people are very active and they make numerous posts in a variety of subreddits. And even if we filter with nosleep, some authors take some time off a series and write one off shorts in between. 

So again, I think that each series posts should have links to the other parts and why this isn't an enforced rule is beyond me. I think this makes perfect sense and should be obligatory to provide a coherent experience to the tens of thousands of daily readers of nosleep. I would love to hear a mod's comment on this and try to understand the reasoning behind it.

I've just started playing ARK. Nighttime was too dark for me and I did some google searching. People kept mentioning that when there's a moon, it isn't too dark.

Well my monitor's brightness is maxed but I still can't see anything. The weird thing is, when I look at the moon it's too bright, and if the moon is in my field of view, the world looks like a normal moonlit night. However if I turn my back, it is literally pitch black. And the weirdest of all, the moon went down, it's not dawn yet the sky is the same night sky, and I can see like a normal night. So I really think that it's a bug because moonlight should illuminate all the time, not when I'm looking at the moon. Also, it doesn't make sense that it's pitch black when there's a moon but just a regular, visible night when it's gone. If it's a feature, I'm sorry but that is not realistic darkness. If it's not, what could be the problem?

Anyway, what I'm wondering is, does the game recognize him? Do the media ask you questions? ""Your son didn't play well tonight, what are your thoughts on that?"" etc. Does he have different options in player interaction? ""You can't keep me at this club forever dad!!"" etc. Or is it simply just another player from the game's perspective?

If so, I'd rather use the editor to rename a player and give him a high PA instead of waiting ten years to design a son who won't even be recognized.

I've searched a lot the past couple days but couldn't find any decent source. Especially after the last module. Most of the executioner trickster rogue builds I've found online made use of Lurker's Assault. Supposedly it makes you ""perma-stealth"". Although I don't want to use perma stealth since it's said to have a low dps output, it would be nice to have a daily that is actually beneficial.

Right now, at level 23, when I use that daily it gives me like only 1 second max. Generally half a second. And because I'm activating stealth first and the daily later, that's some loss there too. I've noticed however that it helps my stealth bar regen faster after it's depleted. So maybe I should use it after it is depleted to get back to stealth faster?

Any tips are welcome. I know that the damage bonus was severely nerfed on that and I can use other dailies as well. I just want something good. And for PVE, I repeat, PVE. I don't really enjoy PVP so please don't advise about that.
