1,"[The Nuremberg Race Laws](https://www.ushmm.org/outreach/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007695)
&gt;At the annual party rally held in Nuremberg in 1935, the Nazis announced new laws which institutionalized many of the racial theories prevalent in Nazi ideology. The laws excluded German Jews from Reich citizenship and prohibited them from marrying or having sexual relations with persons of ""German or related blood."" Ancillary ordinances to the laws disenfranchised Jews and deprived them of most political rights.
&gt;
&gt;The Nuremberg Laws, as they became known, did not define a ""Jew"" as someone with particular religious beliefs. Instead, anyone who had three or four Jewish grandparents was defined as a Jew, regardless of whether that individual identified himself or herself as a Jew or belonged to the Jewish religious community. Many Germans who had not practiced Judaism for years found themselves caught in the grip of Nazi terror. Even people with Jewish grandparents who had converted to Christianity were defined as Jews.

The reason you couldn't ""lie"" your way out of it was because there was a paper trail.  Christians were generally baptized and married in the church.  These life events were recorded by the Church and/or municipalities.  Imagine trying to lie about your grandparents' official government records to the government itself when it demanded proof of your non-Jewishness.",2016-11-20 21:45:28+00:00,da8nrvn,2.0,t1_da8ijlt,6624.0,HistoryPorn

14,"[puts on Catholic School Education hat] The cult of the saints and their relics bears witness to the reality of life after death, the Communion of the Saints, eternal life and the coming resurrection of the body.  Relics' divine *præsentia* and subsequent miracles are signs from God.  Hence, the integrity of their remains must be respected, as are the remains of your relatives (who may well be saints, after all).  Burial is in *imitatione Christi*—in imitation of Christ, true God and true Man, who was crucified, died, was buried, descended into hell and rose again on the third day.  Mixing ashes into plaster or throwing them to the wind or into fireworks shows a lack of understanding of the coming bodily resurrection at the end of time that all Christians hope to share in.

67,"There might be, but honestly lower density and lower population states have tremendous advantages in representation in the federal government compared to large, dense states.  Wyoming (pop 600,000) and California (pop 40,000,000) each have two Senators.  The House of Representatives is slightly better but nowhere near equal.  In short, a citizen of Wyoming's vote counts for much more than a citizen of CA or NY.

Beyond that, states in the US are very fixed.  They're like nation-states, with a certain degree of sovereignty.  They all have, by constitutional law, republican governments and state constitutions and even their own militaries (national guard).  Many of our states have strong or unique identities that precede the nation or precede their joining the union.  Massachusetts, Virginia, Louisiana, Texas.  

So state borders don't change easily.  It takes a traumatic event, like the Civil War, for a state to split up (Virginia split into two states during the Civil War – 1.) the mostly lowland present-day Virginia, who were traitors, and 2.) the upland part, now its own state, West Virginia, who were loyal to the Union).",2016-07-29 22:45:33+00:00,d5wipir,1.0,t3_4v8wht,5221.0,Ask_Politics

72,"Labor history in the US was far more [violent](https://youtu.be/bMV-cU27pg8) than in Europe.  In a sense, business won the war.

The business class and government for years, from the very beginning of labor organizing in the 19th century and peaking during the [Red Scare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Scare) circa WWI and the McCarthyite era in the post-WWII, have dragged ""socialism"" through the mud and have been very smart about it.  They framed it as being against the ""American way of life"" or against ""Americanism"" which was defined by its aspirationalism and boot-strapism.  Anyone can be a billionaire.  You're not a poor worker, you're a temporarily embarrassed billionaire.  (See the adoration of Trump among common people....)  Then, during the Cold War, it became synonymous with ""[traitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_and_Ethel_Rosenberg)"" and Stalin and Mao.  Both the US propaganda machine and (ironically!) the Soviet/Chinese propaganda machines became committed to convincing everyday Americans that what went on Russia and China was ""socialism.""  How could you not hate it?

Meanwhile, after the Great Depression and WW2, when the country and world was on the break of ruin, business and organized labor came to a mutually beneficial agreement that lasted until the 1970s that created a ""[middle-class society](http://prospect.org/article/wages-and-social-contract)"" of good wages, security, leisure and comfort for a large number of US workers.

We were very fortunate to have been founded during the Enlightenment by statesmen with a philosophical bent.  Whatever peace, security and prosperity we have is thanks to them.

As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths disclosed, and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also, and keep pace with the times.

Aside from Indian Americans (or Jamaican Americans), it's mostly a few adventurous middle-class people who attempt to cook curries at home.  You don't see curry beans in a tin can like in the UK.

Mexican and Italian food are our omnipresent ""foreign but not really authentically foreign"" takeaway foods that are also prepared in people's homes.  Chinese food is omnipresent but is mostly takeaway.  Few non-Chinese Americans make the attempt.

Mexican food in the US is shaped by our proximity and shared culture and history (""Tex-Mex"" food).  Red salsa is more common now than ketchup, supposedly.  ""Taco Tuesdays"" is a thing for many people.

Chinese takeaway food is highly bastardized versions of Cantonese dishes modified for American tastes.

Italian food in the US is based on the foods of immigrants from Campania, Sicily and Calabria to the Northeast US and is similarly evolved to American tastes and ingredients.

Personal anecdote: My family is from New York City, where Italians are the largest white ancestry group.  We are not Italian but my mom cooked a lot of classic Italian-American foods like spaghetti and meatballs, lasagna, sausage and peppers, eggplant/chicken/veal parmigiana, chicken cacciatore, baked ziti.

146,"I don't think philosophy is ideology (or a dominant ideology).  Nor do I think eurocentrism (too many white people on reading lists?) in philosophy is a function of racist ideology:  I think the whiteness of its practitioners in history is mostly an accident based on the limitations of language and geography (most of this stuff comes out of the Mediterranean basin and Europe where people with ""Caucasian"" features have been in conversation with each other for 2500 years).  This is a trivial fact and I'm suspicious of the conspiratorial tone of some of the rhetoric used.  It does remind me of unfortunate appellations of the past and present – Nazis use of so-called Aryan and Jewish physics, the Stalinists' ""bourgeois biology,"" and even the more modern and anodyne ""dead white men"" or ""Western medicine.""  All these demean learning and function almost like blood libels.  It's very ugly.  Plato's racial character is as important to his philosophy as Einstein's Ashkenazi Jewish parentage is to his physics theories.  Trivial.  Important to historiographer maybe.  To call it ""white people philosophy"" or ""Jewish physics"" is crude and conspiratorial.

I think we should nonetheless always consider our biases and parochialism.  I do think philosophy is by default Eurocentric, in the sense that it dealt with concerns that Greeks and later Christians and Muslims and seculars had.  The whole theism business from Plato on is especially apparent to me, as a practicing Buddhist.

Also, the history of ancient Indian grammar, logic, etc. began during the so-called Axial Age, along with that of ancient Greece.  It's not ""thousands"" of years older.  (Written history on the subcontinent begins with Ashoka, I believe.)

Finally, I think we should be careful with universalizing our concepts of philosophy or philosophical truth.  In Buddhism, the philosophical quest for truth is sometimes considered undesirable and unhelpful in the more important quest for liberation.  The avyākata or list of ""unfathomable"" propositions charts them out variously as:

* The world is eternal.
* The world is not eternal.
* The world is (spatially) infinite.
* The world is not (spatially) infinite.
* The soul (jiva) is identical with the body.
* The soul is not identical with the body.
* The Tathagata (a perfectly enlightened being) exists after death.
* The Tathagata does not exist after death.
* The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death.
* The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death.

&gt;

I would say it comes from institutions.  Turkey, thanks to 100–150 years of reform and state building, has strongly developed institutions like a police force, courts, public education, mass media.

In a traditional or pre-industrial society, including in Europe a century or more ago, honor killing was what you had instead of the police/courts/etc.  Camille Paglia speaks of the old ""vendetta"" days in Italy whereupon, in the event of a rape, the victim's brothers and uncles would avenge the girl's honor and the family's honor, and the perpetrator would invariably be found dead, hanging from a post in the town square.

I consider it the culture rooted ultimately in pagan Greece and Rome—off the top of my head: their drama, philosophy, science, comedy, the nude/the cult of the body, sports, public spectacle, classical architecture, republicanism/democracy, imperialism, urban planning.  People in Christian countries embraced or re-embraced and assimilated these aspects of culture after the Renaissance and Enlightenment and they did so more fully than Islamic countries.  Muslims do of course share somewhat in the Western heritage, having taken over many Greco-Roman lands, but in a reduced form.  And in the West, thanks to the Christian inheritance, we have elements in our culture that can be as puritanical and iconoclastic as Muslims (see the Reformation and the smashing of statues in churches).",2016-02-15 17:37:39+00:00,d00u575,6.0,t1_d00ssoa,2000.0,europe

315,"When you consider the huge weight of the Greco-Roman inheritance in law, philosophy, science, drama, architecture, sculpture etc., I don't think it's too far off base.  It's just perhaps, if you want to be charitable, a bit of a boutade of enthusiasm to say we owe them everything rather than a statement of quantifiable fact.

You're right to be persnickety for sure.  This is a philosophy forum.  And you're right that the English were working in unique circumstances in their own cultural sphere, but, at the same time, without the ancient Romans and the repeated interpellations of medieval Roman law in Britain (with the Romans themselves occupying Britain and later on with the Gregorian missions, cathedral schools, the Norman invasions and later Renaissance humanist efforts) could there have been common law as we know it?  I don't think so.  The journal article I linked to quotes an old scholar:

&gt;But it would be a mistake to gauge the effect of Roman Law by a nice calculation of the especial rules in our law which can be affiliated to it. What men gained by it was not a heap of fresh material for building English law, but a knowledge of the principles of legal architecture.

316,"English common law is [partially rooted in Roman law](http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1673&amp;context=flr).  Shouldn't be surprising.  The Romans were in Britain before the English, after all.  And the Church's influence was massive.  A lot of the English ""unique butterfly"" stuff (like the idea that Christ came to Britain or that Britons are descended from the Hebrew tribe of Dan) comes from the era of conflict with the Catholic Church when Church of England supporters and radical Protestants wanted to demonstrate that they owe nothing to Rome.  I suspect some of the notions we have about the sui generis nature of common law is residue from that period and its later extension to the American colonies, which attracted a great number of very anti-papist Protestants.",2016-01-03 16:19:59+00:00,cykfogf,6.0,t1_cyk2ayb,41345.0,philosophy

404,"&gt; Well they've also supported healthy nutrition, so I guess in that sense my fitness trainer is a socialist. To categorize welfare or ""government things"" as socialist misses the mark. Capitalism requires welfare and government action, too. (and yes that is a fact, and no I'm not going to discuss Ayn Rand fantasyland capitalism)
&gt; Socialism is characterized by being diametrically opposed to the capitalist mode of production. That's the qualitative difference. Both systems need policemen and roads, it doesn't make any sense to use these things to characterize the system.

You're right to harken back to that basic definition of socialism, but I think you're throwing the baby out with the bathwater.  The fact that liberals have stolen socialist programs to serve the interests, in part, of bourgeois capitalism is too bad (although even that system is coming to an end, as you're aware).  Social insurance and progressive taxation do not have capitalist cooties as a result.  They're still vital elements of emancipatory struggle and should not be trivialized.

8. Equal liability of all to work. Establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture. 
9. Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries; gradual abolition of all the distinction between town and country by a more equable distribution of the populace over the country.

&gt;The closing of the University of Athens by Justinian in 529 was not, as is always stated, the end of Classical philosophy — there had been no Classical philosophy for centuries. What he did, forty years before the birth of Mohammed, was to end the theology of the Pagan Church by closing this school and — as the  historians forget to add — to end the Christian theology also by closing those of Antioch and Alexandria.  Dogma was complete, finished — just as it was in the West with the Council of Trent (1564) and the Confession of Augsburg (1540),  for with the city and intellectualism religious creative force comes to an end. So also in Jewry and in Persia, the Talmud was concluded about 500, and when Chosroes Nushirvan in 519 bloodily suppressed the Reformation of Mazdak — 
which was not unlike our Anabaptism in its rejection of marriage and worldly property, and had been supported by King Kobad I as counteracting the power of Church and nobility — Avestan dogma similarly passed into fixity.",2015-08-08 00:01:38+00:00,ctvexaj,2.0,t1_ctutrrj,32968.0,philosophy

Creemos que todo animal no humano tiene tanto derecho a la vida como nosotros, por el simple hecho de que igual que nosotros puede sentir y nosotros no somos nadie para quitarles la libertad y mucho menos lo más preciado que todos tenemos que es la vida y estamos concientes de que la única forma de erradicar el especismo es con una vida vegana.

Protección del Perro Callejero AC Properro
Distrito Federal

Protección del Perro Callejero, A.C. (Pro-Perro) es una asociación
sin fines de lucro, fundada en 2003, aunque su labor inició
informalmente años atrás, en Cuautepec, Del. Gustavo A. Madero.
 
La misión y objetivos de Pro-Perro son:
 
-Promover la práctica de la esterilización de perros y gatos,
como único medio efectivo para controlar de manera humanitaria el
creciente problema de la sobrepoblación canina y felina. Para ello,
Pro-Perro lleva a cabo:
 
-Campañas de educación y concientización en las escuelas primarias y
entre la comunidad de Cuautepec;
 
-Cirugías casi gratuitas en su Módulo de Esterilizaciones. (Se pide
donativo por esterilización o el material de curación, y se obsequia
un collar con placa de identificación grabada con la leyenda “No me
mates. Ya estoy esterilizado”, y la vacuna antirrábica proporcionada
por la SSA).
 
-Capacitación de médicos veterinarios en el método de cirugía
acelerada implementado por Pro-Perro y que permite hacer un número de
esterilizaciones en tiempo mínimo, superando por mucho el promedio de
cirugías que se realiza en un consultorio veterinario con el método
“convencional”;
 
-Ofrecer servicios veterinarios gratuitos a la comunidad para
prevenir contagios que pongan en riesgo la salud humana y evitar que
las mascotas sean arrojadas a la calle (otro factor que contribuye a
la sobrepoblación)
 
-Encontrar adoptantes para los perros callejeros que se rescatan
y esterilizan.
 
-Frenar las campañas de exterminio que se llevan a cabo con lujo
de crueldad en los así llamados “centros antirrábicos”.
 
-Establecer, a largo plazo, centros de esterilización en todas
las zonas marginales de la ciudad, donde la sobrepoblación canina y
felina alcanza niveles incontrolables.

Hence, most of our nation's population lives with climates that are continental—with more extreme summers (and winters, might I add).  We are also further to the south than you.  Our northern cities like New York and Boston are about the same latitudes as Naples or Madrid.  So we get lots of solar radiation.  Nonetheless, those regions that have similar oceanic and Mediterranean climates as yours (San Francisco, Seattle) don't use very much air conditioning.  So it's not that we're greedy monsters.  It's just that, as I mentioned, most of our country is humid and disgusting.  Air conditioning is the only thing that prevents ball sweat and swamp ass.

ETA:  two beverages of interest to locavores that come from the interior of the country are aguardiente (similar to pastis/ouzo/sambuca/rakı) and chicha, which is basically Andean moonshine.

Modern architecture : [sense 1] Western architecture since the Renaissance ; [sense 2] Western and international architecture after the Industrial Revolution, including post-modernism, expressionism etc. ; [sense 3] the International Style

Modern : [sense 1] of the present moment as opposed to of the past ; [sense 2] of or relating to Western society since various rupture points in history : the conquests of Alexander, the fall of Rome, the growth of Scholasticism—but more usually—since the Renaissance, the French Revolution, the industrial revolution ; [sense 3] of or relating to the industrial, capitalist/socialist, globalized civilization since the late 19th century marked by revolutionary social, technological and cultural change.

contemporary : of the present moment, helpful if you want to avoid discussion of what modernity means

classical architecture : Greco-Roman architecture before the decline and fall of Rome and rise of Byzantium ; the recovery of knowledge of which was an ongoing project in Western architecture since at least the time of Charlemagne but especially since the Italian Renaissance with the recovery of the writings of the Roman architect and engineer Vitruvius (which formed but one set of writings out of many by the Greeks and Romans; but one of the few to have survived into the modern period).

classicism : the study of or redeployment of the principles of classical architecture in the post-classical period

traditional architecture : a relative term for architecture that exists or existed before or alongside various rupture points in the history of building techniques, notably, before the advent of mass culture and national/global distribution networks when builders relied on local knowledge and techniques (can be industrial or pre-industrial)

traditional : a relative term that connotes a set of practices that have a long history tied to a specific location or group of people",2015-07-18 22:25:07+00:00,ct83003,1.0,t3_3da926,359112.0,architecture

717,"A lot of people balk at the idea of ranking things, but I find it amusing and fun to learn about snobbery.  This is snobbery at its best.  I suspect what makes a cuisine ""great"" is (or was) the presence of a monarchical or imperial court that could devote a lot of manpower and money to come up with this stuff to delight themselves, impress others and separate themselves from the masses.  I've seen Chinese, French, Mexican, Italian and Indian cooking included among the ""greats.""

French haute cuisine was considered the standard throughout the 20th century.  Escoffier is a major figure in its codification.

Some people claim French greatness in food was ripped off the Italians thanks to Catherine de' Medici bringing her chefs to France after her marriage to the king.

Mexican food is held up as ""great"" for its variety, innovation, all the local crops that have gone on to worldwide fame (tomato, vanilla, chocolate), and the influence of the French during their brief rule in the country in the 19th century.

Peruvian food is my personal fave among South American cuisines.  I think it's lightyears better than what you find in Colombia/Venezuela, Argentina/Brazil, or Chile.

Then you have Chinese and Indian cuisines, which are massively important and internally diverse.

My personal fave cuisine of all is Syro-Lebanese and Turkish.  Haven't yet tried ""Ottoman.""",2015-06-22 20:12:15+00:00,csf4hk5,1.0,t3_3aqiwm,7051.0,AskCulinary

728,"&gt;I don't think there's any moral grade that Dolezal could receive that would justify her appropriation of black identity and culture. Gender is simply more individually-flexible than race.

That seems entirely capricious.

&gt;I can start wearing more feminine clothes, adapt a new hormone regiment, grow out my hair and rename myself to be accepted as a woman. But whereas Dolezal jokes about 'spending a lot of time in the sun,' a black person cannot spend less time in the sun and magically become white.

Putting aside the fact that I think it requires quite a bit more work to transition between genders than to alter your racial appearance, I don't see how differences in difficulty are relevant to your contention that gender nonconformity is acceptable while racial nonconformity is not.

BTW, as many people have been discussing this week, plenty of black people can and do become white—namely, light-skinned black people.  They are often majority ""white"" biologically anyway.  It's clear that Rachel Dolezal was passing as that sort of black person.

&gt;And even if a black person could, they'd still have all the 'black' experiences leading up to that point that would still build in them a black identity. Dolezal is more like a voyeur who decided she wanted to put herself in the same position. But she'll never truly understand, and she'll never truly be black. In the end, it's her choice that makes her white, and the lack thereof that makes people black.

Again, I don't see how ""fully understanding"" or ""partially understanding"" or any differences in levels of understanding or withstanding communitarian suffering contributes to your assertion that gender nonconformism is authentic while race-nonconformism is not.  Isn't that essentializing blackness as suffering?  Isn't that the same fallacy (like in this recent  [NYTimes article](http://nyti.ms/1dlF2pY)) that some feminists use against male-to-female trans people?  The idea that they ""will never"" understand what it means to grow up as a girl, as victim of patriarchal ideology, and that therefore they will never be women?

I think that's all rather capricious.  People can experience womanhood in many ways.  People can experience blackness in many ways.  I would say that individuals have more agency than you give them credit for.  I don't see how other people have any real way to judge a person's self-experience.",2015-06-19 00:12:14+00:00,csbc2yw,6.0,t1_csb86rr,7058.0,askphilosophy

734,"I agree with almost all your points on privilege and what-not.  I feel I need to clarify a bit:

&gt;No one's persecuting Dolezal, unless you consider criticism to be persecution, but I find that to be strange and quite frankly, insulting to anyone who's actually been persecuted. Racism is how tribalism is manifested in society today.

In an interview today with Melissa Harris-Perry, she describes how people have said they would ""destroy her"" if she continues to work in any way as an activist.  There have been endless other abusive comments.  I imagine there are or will be death threats.

&gt;There are plenty of NAACP branch leaders who are white. You don't have to be black to be accepted in black communities 'as one of their own' -- they're not wolves for crying out loud. And clearly, her charade could not last forever.

They're not wolves, but white people would have a harder time accepting a mixed-race-white-person who looks mostly black, thanks to the one-drop rule.  Comparatively speaking, black people are welcoming of a large range of diversity and I find that wonderful.  (Trying to find the positive angle in this story.)

&gt;Couple that with the fact that she sued Howard University for being discriminated as a white person, and what I see is not a champion for blacks who sympathizes so deeply that she wishes to be black, but rather, I see a compulsive liar who will say whatever is convenient to her current circumstances.

Do people have to be morally decent (I think Dolezal acted unethically in several ways) for us to accept their self-conception?  Would a genderqueer person who files dumb lawsuits or files false police reports (like Dolezal) lose credibility in their genderqueer claims?
