So!  I've bought a hanukiah from a thrift shop to display at a ""holiday party"" at my house which coincides with Hanukkah.  I will have a Christmas tree so I wanted to not be a jerk and also honor the traditions of my Jewish friends.  None of them are particularly religious as far as I know, but they are certainly culturally Jewish.  (One of them mentioned to me that my party is falling during Hanukkah.  I had forgotten completely.)  

Is this too try-hardy?  Any tips on etiquette?  I understand it's a bit of an eye-roll situation, all this generic, homogenizing holiday stuff.  I would like to avoid that as much as possible.  It will occupy its own prominent place, away from the tree.  I don't plan on lighting it myself.  I will offer to give it away to whoever might want it.

But when the bright light of all the world was put out, or, rather, when the Roman Empire was decapitated, and, to speak more correctly, the whole world perished in one city...Who would believe that Rome, built up by the conquest of the whole world, had collapsed, that the mother of nations had become also their tomb; that the shores of the whole East, of Egypt, of Africa, which once belonged to the imperial city, were filled with the hosts of her men-servants and maid-servants, that we should every day be receiving in this holy Bethlehem men and women who once were noble and abounding in every kind of wealth but are now reduced to poverty? We cannot relieve these sufferers: all we can do is to sympathise with them, and unite our tears with theirs. The burden of this holy work was as much as we could carry; the sight of the wanderers, coming in crowds, caused us deep pain; and we therefore abandoned the exposition of Ezekiel, and almost all study, and were filled with a longing to turn the words of Scripture into action, and not to say holy things but to do them.
