75,"I can't remember when we transitioned but my bub is now 15 weeks old. At first probably 6-8 weeks we did what you do, putting her down so I could pee was a trial. Slowly started to read out loud to her. Sometimes her little picture books, sometimes the book I'm currently reading. She didn't like it at first but most days we do a baby massage, which I love because I want her to be able to like being touched and both hubby and I love giving and getting massages. She loves being on her gym mat now though not for really long periods of time. We spent about 2 hours out on a walk this morning. Put her in her high chair with a few toys on the balcony while I hung up the washing. Often the days go fast - it's the days she sleeps a lot that drag for me!",2015-10-11 05:11:06+00:00,cvvjwfy,1,t3_3o3xih,136843,beyondthebump

79,"I really don't get it. Why are people so vindictive? How did it come about? I remember in high school sometimes people would get egged on their birthdays. I used to worry that I would get egged on my birthday, but then I realised I wasn't cool enough for the kids who'd do that sort of thing to care when my birthday was so I dodged a bullet there! I was just walking along the waterfront with bub in the pram and I can see broken eggshells and egg on the ground. You really have to go to quite a bit of effort to egg someone; buy the eggs and bring them without breaking them, hiding them, hoping it doesn't crack on you - it all seems a bit too much trouble for what it's worth.
Have you ever been egged? How did you cope with the glop all over you? What did you do?
Were you the egger? Why did you do it? Did you feel a rush?",2015-10-11 00:04:46+00:00,cvvai6g,1,t3_3o9zk3,16,AskReddit
80,"My daughter is 14 weeks tomorrow and exactly the same. I posted about this at maybe around 6 or 8 weeks myself! She's (usually) fine on the way to somewhere but has definitely had enough on the way home and if we're unlucky enough (which is generally most of the time) that she doesn't fall asleep then she cries. I've tried all the suggestions and nothing seems to work. It can't be the seat because we use it in the pram and she's fine. She has her crab which she loves talking to and smiling at but once he's had enough no amount of music, static, me sitting next to her rocking her or anything will work other than pulling over and getting her out or getting home.

90,"I had this problem from about my 2nd month of pregnancy, most of which was over summer. Like you not much really helped and my feet and ankles are still swollen nearly 2 weeks after delivery. What I did find that helped in the summer though was going swimming - I swim twice a week with a masters squad and would look forward to jumping in the pool (less so as winter came along though!). The cool water plus the exercise of kicking your feet and not having weight on them really helped.
Unfortunately for me I ended up having to buy shoes 2 sizes bigger than my usual just to have something that would fit me that weren't jandals/thongs/flip flops digging into me.
Good luck and I hope you find something that works for you!",2015-07-10 02:08:59+00:00,csy54sp,1,t3_3cqp07,6143,BabyBumps
