Uuuuugh. As if the first 6 weeks after my caesar with bleeding/discharge wasn't enough. I got what I suspect may have been my period at about 4 and a half weeks post caesar. A crapload of blood after daily but very minimal since the caesar. Sort of feeling crampy in my abdomen, suspect it's possibly my period but also have a vague recollection around the time I was in hispital that if there was bleeding to go to the doctor. So I go to the doctor. She says it's more probably left over bleeding from my uterus. After checking a photo I'd taken of a bloody pad she writes me a script for some antibiotics (that my husband checked and is apparently for preventing infection). I also mentioned that due to haemarroids I had a bit of blood when I pooped.
The bleeding got worse the next day and then seemed to clear up over another few days (though I believe nothing to do with the medication). She also wrote me a script for a suppository I really didn't want to take (when the chemist got them in a few days later everything seemed back to normal so I didn't end up using them)...

I had a check up with another doctor regarding a follow up for blood clot I'd got in my leg after coming home from the hospital and mentioned it to her and she asked me if it was my period. How am I supposed to know? They're the doctors... I don't know, Is it my period? The last doctor told me it was unlikely!

6 week check up with obstetrician and the lining of my uterus is back to normal and all seems well. I told her about the whole thing and she said that they just don't know/can't tell. It could be my period but it also might not be. Weird, I mean I know breastfeeding /usually/ keeps it from starting but not always and i guess I'd enjoyed not having it while I was preggers!

Fastforward to around 7 weeks (as of Monday) post birth and now I seem to have a bladder infection and blood in my poop again though no pain, so I bite the bullet and insert a suppository. That's when my butt decided to start feeling irritated and painful, and I also have a return of the bleeding.

A three for one deal this time are you freaking kidding me? I'm supposed to be well on the road to recovery by now! Back to the doctor for the suspected bladder infection. I mention that 2 and a half weeks later I'm bleeding again and is it my damn period!?? Again I'm told that it's likely just some that had got stuck somewhere, and was written another script for some other antibiotics. Since we went late to the doctor and by the time we headed home our little bub was screaming in the car we didn't fill the script. By the next day the bladder infection feeling is gone and I decide that if it stays that way I don't want to take or pay for any more medication if I could avoid it.

Yesterday morning the cramps were quite painful but eased before I could get to any pain killers. Today the bleeding is gone for most of today but returned a bit tonight, with another bout of cramps. It feels like my period. 

I just wish a knew what the heck it is. If it is my period PLEASE tell me I'm not going to get it every three damn weeks!!??

At least I was able to use a birthday massage voucher today at long last, I've been hoarding that since April and I wish I had more up my sleeve... *le sigh*

My poor hubby got a couple of days worth before bleeding kicked back in again and there's only so much porn can do! LOL

I'm trying not to post on facebook too much about Lily but it's /hard/! I often can't get to my laptop and can just access facebook from my phone one handed while feeding or soothing, and often times not even then because it usually works out that my phone is close to the hand that is busy holding the baby.

She's so new and when she's not feeding she often doesn't sleep unless it's on either me or hubby so we play tag team though it usually falls on me as hubby is busy doing errands or work (at home work like rearranging the baby room or helping his Dad or working on his websites) particularly as I had a c-section and can't do a lot of things.

That's another thing no one I ever know of talks about - what happened when they had caesarian sections. I mean, I never really looked into it because I wasn't expecting to have one, nearly 5 weeks since the operation and I'm still recovering and it's likely to go on for longer than the 6 weeks quoted by doctors and nurses.

I've got so many issues stemming from it now I'm just over everything being wrong with me and want things to start being right again. I've just discovered what I think is a second blood clot in my right leg - found the first one the day after we got home from the hospital which I've already had two ultrasounds on and after a late night doctor appointment last night I now have to have another one. At least (so far) it's superficial veins and not DVT but quit it already!

Most of the stuff I want to whinge about is TMI for general chit chat so I mostly keep it to myself and hubby but it's really getting to be a drag when I just want to be on the road to recovery already. I want to get back into the pool, I want to get out and ride my bike, I want to be able to use the cross trainer we bought while I was preggers, I want to actively try and get rid of the extra weight I gained but have been rather limited to just walking. 

The doc said I need to exercise to help with the clot as they don't want to put me on medication while I'm breastfeeding unless absolutely necessary. But they say to take it easy and don't do too much for the first 6 weeks. One place recommended no stairs for the first 4 weeks post op - but we live up 4 flights of stairs and I've been up and down them every day often several times a day. We've been bushwalking at 2 and a half weeks and did a pretty steep walk up to another lookout a few days ago at about 4 and a half weeks.

(TMI Warning:) At just after 4 weeks post op I started getting very red bloody discharge and after 4 or 5 days of it I double checked with the doctor yesterday and she prescribed me antibiotics in case of infection but basically made out like it was normal. Have had a lot more blood today and am trying not to worry myself about it (we did some research and apparently if you fill a pad in an hour for 3 consecutive hours is when you should get worried and it hasn't got to that point yet).

On the plus side Liliana is the cutest little thing (obviously!) and both hubby and I can't wait until she is old enough to start smiling back voluntarily, or laughing and playing with us. 5 weeks has gone so fast already but it's hard not to be impatient. We are so lucky we have a happy healthy little girl! :-D",beyondthebump,How do you not talk about your kids/recent experiences and bore everyone's pants off?

I am oh so uncomfortable and I guess I'm lucky in that I've only really started finding it really difficult to sleep in the last two weeks or so. I'm a stomach sleeper so sleeping on my sides has been an adjustment, but now my hips and back ache and I have to pee at least every hour. Sometimes I just sit on the bed wondering if it's too early to go out to the couch but even that isn't comfortable.

I've gained a lot of weight in my pregnancy and now little Pip's head is so far into my pelvis the doctor can't measure her head with the ultrasound as my bone's in the way.

She tried sweeping the membrane yesterday to see if that would induce labour but nothing happened. I'm glad hubby has some time off work to keep me company but I'm so sore and uncomfortable all the time. He constantly asks me how I'm doing and I feel bad because the answer is always the same, I'm not feeling the best and am super tired due to not sleeping well and yeah have been having some contractions but only irregular ones, nope, not in labour yet.

I'm bored, I've done a fair bit of cleaning since I finished work but I've basically done everything I am capable of doing at this point, our internet is really slow due to the area we live so despite spending time on the computer and trying to watch netflix there are times where nothing is loading and I'm super bored.

We've gone out to see a movie (though I was unsure I wanted to pay for that in case I might have to leave early), we've been out to lunch but we can't do a whole lot of stuff as we're going to be low on cash for a while so it's best to stay at home in order to not spend too much money.


Glad it's winter here right now but am trying to stick to dresses when I can as even the maternity pants I've got are digging into me uncomfortably - most of the time it's not too bad because I've got the pregnancy furnace going on which is an awesome novel experience as usually I freeze.

I'm super uncomfortable and want it to be over already but also am pretty scared about labour itself and am trying not to think about it so I don't stress myself out.

Unfortunately Pip moving can be quite painful to me down in my pelvis and I am constantly wondering if something is starting but then no, it's just normal movements. It will be weird to not feel her moving in there all the time too.

I guess I'm just waiting with a mix of eager anticipation and dread as the next step is going to change our lives forever. We've been enjoying each other's company but from here on out nothing is going to be the same ever again.
