When things don't go his way, or he gets really stressed out (this can go from an argument with his dad to losing in video games) he'll smash his head into things. Aside from the obvious danger of doing this, it's really scary. One time he put his head through the wall. He smashes it into his desk frequently. I've never put it in writing before so it's really quite shocking right now for me.

I don't know how to stop him doing this... I can't convince him to go to anger management or therapy sooner. Another thing I should mention is that atm we're long distance (I'm in UK he's in Canada).
