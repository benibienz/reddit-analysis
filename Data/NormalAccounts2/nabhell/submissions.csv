Last week I noticed that my Macbook Pro freezes randomly with increasing frequency. However, there's no spinning beach ball or error messages. The screen just froze and it requires me to shut the Mac down by pushing the power button.

So I did a few standard troubleshooting, resetting the SMC and also the NVRAM. Nothing changed. The, I did the Apple Diagnostics and it says that my battery requires service. However, when I checked the status bar and the system report, both stated that my battery condition is normal.

For what it's worth I do noticed that my battery doesn't last as long now and when my Mac freezes, it is unusually warm. How do I solve this problem? Thank you!
