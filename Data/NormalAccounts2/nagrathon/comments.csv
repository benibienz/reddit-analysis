305,"Nope. Christians are by no means perfect. I sin every day. The point of the sacrifice of Christ is that he lived a perfect life and so was the perfect sacrifice. He died so we don't have to go to hell. That's where being a believer comes in. Believing that he died because he loves you. And that is what inspires being a Christian (wanting to model your life after his). We can't be perfect, and we can't keep from sinning, but we can strive to make the choices that honor him.

307,"This might not be wanted anymore, but I've always thought of there being a distinction between being a Christian and a believer. Basically being a Christian means that you try to be like Christ, (savior of the religion). This includes a certain set of morals that can honestly be best down by the 10 commandments. Everything kinda boils down to those. And being a believer means you believe that Christ died for the sins of man and that he is the savior of mankind.

But there comes a point in which the building is done and everything just takes off. This is easily one of my favorite books, especially because there's one point, and those who have read it know what I'm talking about, where I just had to set the book down and take a moment.

316,My thoughts are few as to what can make it better: One-stop killing every supporting character that people start to love just to get more angst. Two -Bring back the Classic Rock. I think everybody can agree that's part of what made 1-5 great. Three- set down a real goal for the show to end on and then work towards it. 1-5 were so great because they had an end game. You don't see a best selling book series where the author just wrote what seemed like a good idea at the time. They always know how the story is going to end and they work to get there.  ,2015-07-20 20:59:14+00:00,cta4oly,1,t3_3dybvh,20946,Supernatural
