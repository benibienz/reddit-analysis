I opened it up to her talking to my ex's mother about how awful I am and how I should basically be worshiping the ground my ex walks on for ever loving me. I saw another conversation where she bashed me to my father for reminding her of my mother.

* Contentiously told me that teens are irresponsible drivers and had to wait until I was 18 to get a permit. Never taught to drive with said permit, so it was useless.

* Never shown how to handle money or financial situations. All finances were hidden away and hush hush.

* Never taught how to do make-up. Make-up was for ""sluts"". I had to hide it away and pray they never found it.

* I was never shown how to dress professionally. 

*  Basic hygiene. I wasn't taught to shave or about how to handle my monthly.

* I was only taught how to cook extremely basic, bland meals. Only my dad cooked, Nstep was too lazy and above cooking.

* Laundry. I was expected to do my own, but I was never taught how. I knew there was soap, water, and the washing machine involved. That was it. So many outfits ruined.

* When to go to the doctor for a medical problem. Medical issues were largely ignored, so when we were really sick, nobody was sure if it was serious or not.
