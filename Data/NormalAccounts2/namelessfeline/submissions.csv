**Some background:**
My E/(N?)dad, about a month ago, had gotten pneumonia. He didn't realize the severity of the illness and didn't see a doctor until he could not move. Eventually, he called an ambulance and was carted to the ER, where they found out he was septic. He was literally dying and neither he, nor my stepmother took it seriously. I didn't learn about this until the day he was released from the hospital, when he called me. My step mother made no move to call me [18] or my brother [16] and tell us that my father was dying.

**The problem:**
I recently broke down and told my grandmother on my dad's side that I was never told when my dad was sick, until he was released. She didn't know this and decided to tell my dad that my stepmother is being cruel by withholding information. My dad is not answering my grandmother's calls anymore and she is becoming worried about him.

Now she is pressuring me to call my dad. I do not feel comfortable calling my dad. I am extremely anxious and do not want to have to talk to him about my feelings about my stepmother, because I know that is where the conversation will take us. My grandmother believes that since I am an adult now, and my dad is mentally ill (he has paranoid schizophrenia and bipolar disorder that he manages with medication), that I am responsible for calling him more often. Even though my father had promised my brother and I that he would call twice a week, just as my mother had done when we lived in his house.

***

I guess that was mostly a rant... But, I don't know what to do. My dad doesn't call me anymore and I'm too scared to call him, because I don't want to hear that my Nstep was justified. Do I just get over it and call? Am I being ridiculous in being scared? Do I tell my dad to stick to his original call plan, or is it my responsibility to call him as an adult?

Edit: My dad called me right after posting this. Spooky. He spent this ranting about how his doctor is cutting his painkillers and ranting about his problems. He said he hasn't called because he has been on a down. I didn't tell him to call more often, because I chickened out.

My brother and I only see them a few times a year due to my brother being in school, me working, and them being ""not ready to accommodate us"" (Read as: they spent too much money on GC sis's softball equipment to care for the house or buy decent food.) Really, I don't have to go with my brother, as I'm 18 and the divorce visitation laws don't apply to me anymore, but he won't go without me because it's too much alone.

Their house was always bad growing up, but I mostly kept it in order by cleaning all I could when they weren't looking. But, since I wasn't there to clean anymore, it was a disaster. They had trash filling the overgrown yard. My brother's bathtub was full of mold, as well as his bedroom ceiling. There were bugs all in his room. My bedroom floor was sticky and it smelled of cat piss, which they claimed to have tried to clean up. The dishwasher was dead and dishes piled the sink and onto the counter. The fridge was full of mold. The floor looked like it hadn't been mopped in years. They didn't even clean it when they spilled food or kool-aid. Keep in mind, two little elementary school kids live there with them. It was no wonder they were always sick. 

While there, I went to my sis's softball game in the blistering heat to make Nstep and sis happy. We ate snacks and most of the time I walked with Edad and my brother. Eventually, I started overheating and had to sit in the car. My dad sat with me for a bit and I confided in him that I felt stared at due to my unconventional haircut. He, in short, told me to suck it up as it was my fault for cutting my hair into a mohawk. Thanks dad.

We went home, and for the next week, before making sure my brother was okay with it and he had a friend to go to if it got too bad, I spent my days with my long distance boyfriend and his family, where they made me feel at home. We watched movies, played games, and they made meals each night. It was like the family I wish I had growing up. They were great to me and even asked if I'd rather they put me in a hotel than be at my dad's. I declined.  At the end of the night, I'd go back to my dad's and they'd either be watching a movie and playing on their phones and I'd sit with them, or they'd be asleep and I'd go to my old bedroom and try to sleep.

I asked my brother what it was like there without me. He said the little kids rampaged, he was expected to watch them, and my dad slept in bed all day or on the couch. My dad is mentally ill, yes, but he is fully functioning. It's been determined that he can work and function as an adult by plenty of doctors, he just chooses not to and uses his schizophrenia as an excuse.

At the end of the week, a few hours before my mom drove to pick us up from the hell hole, my Nstep made me sit on my bed while my dad stood blocking me at the door, and she unloaded on me. She told me how ungrateful I was, and how sick my dad is because I won't spend time with them. She told me how she *raised* me and how I need to respect her in their house. She told me that she wouldn't help me look for my belongings that I knew she stole, because she was done dealing with me and I didn't deserve those things I bought. Oh, and I made them lose so much money because I moved away and they couldn't get government benefits from me living there and I was the reason they were now poor. I yelled and screamed back at her that if they wanted us there, they should have made us feel accepted and clean their damn house. Most of the yelling from them was about me not spending time with them and spending time, when I can see my boyfriend anytime (I can't.), and making my siblings sad for not seeing them enough.

So, I guess I just wanted to know if I really *was* wrong to spend all that time with my boyfriend, and not them? I'm sorry for this being long and rambley.

I moved there to be with my mom after realizing that my parents were harming my health.

I was extremely nervous to go to this school. Being in another state, I had to take online classes to make up for the classes they didn't require at my old school. Graduating felt like it was a very big accomplishment to me, because I was sure that I'd never do it. Even my school counselor was really nervous that I wouldn't be able to and I'd have to take summer classes.

For the occasion, my dad and Nstep said they would take the family and drive down to where I live and visit me and my brother, as well as give me my belongings. My dad made it out that he wanted to celebrate the special day. As we got closer to the date, he started saying that he wasn't sure they had the money, gas was expensive. Nstep was telling him this, because those are her typical excuses for doing anything for me.

We unload all of my stuff from the truck. There were all my belongings in dingy, gross boxes. When I said we, I meant my mom, brother, stepdad, Nstep's kids, and I. Nstep and dad refused to help. My belongings, my problem. I shouldn't of left in the first place.

At the graduation, my dad and Nstep sat as far away from the rest of my family as possible. They sat on the exact other side of the gym were this was being held. At the end, when they were leaving, they wanted pictures. I had to trek to the other side of the building in the blistering heat in my robes because they wouldn't meet me. As soon as I met them, Nstep made fun of the dress I had picked, which was a sailor dress, and my socks, because she could see them under the robe. She refused to be in the family photos. She always does this because she's embarrassed by how she looks.

To celebrate my graduation, we had a small party at my mom's house. She made me a cake and my aunt and my stepdad's family came to make the day special. My mom invited my dad and Nstep. Nstep loudly refused. I have no clue why my Nstep would do this, especially since I was told they wanted to celebrate. I cried my entire party. 

I was always told by my Nstep that graduating was nothing to be proud of, because everyone should graduate. She really made my day poop.

This didn't ever make sense to me, because our home was perfect in the big city, I was surrounded by friends, and my bio-mom lived there, and by law I had to see her. Another thing was that we didn't grow up having a lot of money, but all of a sudden, we had the money to move to a $500,000 house in the middle of nowhere.

Let me explain. I'm 18 and my brother is younger at 16 years. We are both visiting my dad for 10 days. The only thing is that him and my step mother are extremely filthy people. 

The house isn't in a total state of disrepair yet, but it is getting there. The tiles are peeling off the floor, etc. This isn't the problem, though. The house is absolutely disgusting. I'm currently staying in my old room, which is currently my younger sister's, and the carpet is sticky and smells of cat piss. The bathroom is full of mouse and bug dropping. There is mold covering the shower. My brother's room is in even worse shape than mine. The floor hasn't been mopped in over half a year. There are mouse and bug dropping as well. There is mold all along the base boards, and mold covering the bathroom, as well as fecal matter backed up into his shower. We have both been told that the beds are clean, but you can see why we might not believe this.

Along with this, nobody washes their hands and they all have a sickly cough. Disease is known to hit this family once a month at the least. Our step mother is also verbally abusive to the both of us, especially since we moved out.

I was wanting to know how to survive this for just 10 days until we can leave. Staying at a hotel is not an option. Both me and my brother are very weak people and could use any advice.
