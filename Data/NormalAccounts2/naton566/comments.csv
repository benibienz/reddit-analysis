43,"In Enderal you have 2 sections for skills, combat related and non-combat related. Where your idea is different is how you level them up and how to spend perks in these skills.

 - levelling up grants a perk and work similarly to Skyrim perk tree however Enderals tree is better for RPG play in my opinion.

 - Combat skills have their own point system and you use those points by reading skills books.

 - Non-combat skills have their own points and work the same as combat skills.

Essentially in Enderal in order the level your skills up you need to read skills books but they can only be read if you have enough points in that skills section.

 - it works for Enderal because of how the area is levelled and it stops you from Power levelling as much but It feels odd IMO.

Spiked Armour, Cage armour and there helmeted version are a weird set in the creation kit as they are actually just seperate clothing items with armour pieces already on them. for example the cage armour is just a drifter outfit with raider pieces on it.

Edit: I thought I would make it more clear as re-reading that was actually quite confusing.
in the creation kit clothing has a bunch of different slots (top head, long hair, eyes, beard, hands, under chest, armour chest, ect.) With the cage armour and spike armour sets all the slots are already taken, moving those slots to something else is not possible as it would actually just disable the armour pieces that are on the outfit already. another example is that some of the hats in game actually disable your hair while wearing them.

My problem with this film is that for one it is far too long and I get it, they had to cram a lot of stuff in their but I honestly felt like the bad guy was their just for sake of having a bad guy, I would have preferred if it was a matter of ideology rather than oh Cap is right because insert bad guy.

Iron Man's side just completely felt flat to me due to the focus on the actual bad guy in the film.
