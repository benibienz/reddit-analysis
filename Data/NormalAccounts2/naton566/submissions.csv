So I've decided it's time I made a plugin for Nuka World that allows armour pieces to go over any clothing (works correctly) and I have also allowed them to use ballistic weave and vault suit linings (both work correctly) however when it comes to mods such as ""dense"" and ultra-light they do not show up.

Another version of my mod which only effects vanilla clothing is using all the identical keywords needed as the Nuka World clothing and those clothes work with the extra mods ""dense"" and ""ultra-light""


 Key words used:
- ap_Railroad_ClothingArmor

- ap_armor_lining

- ma_armor_lining

- ma_armor_Leather_Torso

- ma_Vaultsuit

- ma_Railroad_ClothingArmor


  
both vanilla and Nuka World have the same keywords but only vanilla allow the ""dense"" and ""ultra-light"" mods. same thing happens with Far Harbour and Automatron.

Any ideas?

I have done all the quests that I possibly can do at the moment without getting slaughtered in 2 hits by normal NPCs. Surely if I manage to kill the boss It should be an accomplishment, a feat of my skill as a player? I should deserve to use the loot I have earned.

Some of you may be aware that a couple of months ago that Bethesda and valve tried making paid mods a thing on steam and it failed miserably, it only lasted 2 days before they decided it was a terrible idea and abandoned paid mods...... For now.

With mods coming to Xbox one it is imperative that Xbox gamers do not buy mods if they do turn up (and they will). I know you will be excited to try out some cool mods but you have to think of the long term, if you buy mods that just tells developers that you are happy to buy mods which has always been intended to be free.

Kick up a fuss and paid mods will disappear however mods altogether will not disappear.
