4,"Your boyfriend sounds awful. 1. He doesn't treat you like you are his girlfriend, more like a roommate that he mooches off of 2. He cares more about money than your mental health 3. He is less educated and less financially stable than you, and he doesn't even make up for it in kindness (asking you to pay back rent even though youre the breadwinner?) 4. he sounds really boring. His only hobby is playing video games? 

It sounds like you'd be 100x better off without his lazy ass. I can tell by your post that you are eloquent and well-educated. You need a man who meets your standards. I think that the way a man spends money on his girlfriend isn't just about the money -- it shows how generous of a person he is and how much he is willing to sacrifice for you. Just keep that in mind. Good luck.",2016-06-10 03:50:40+00:00,d438mew,1.0,t3_4nccab,31733.0,relationships
5,"Hmm I understand your situation much better now. I know you don't want to divorce but a small break might make her see her behavior from a different perspective. Literally the day after my boyfriend and I broke up I felt the negative thoughts disappearing. Just like other people have been saying though, professional help is needed. I wish you the best of luck and I know how much it sucks to be in your position because my boyfriend told me how awful it was.",2016-06-05 21:37:28+00:00,d3xa0il,3.0,t1_d3x9c0d,1076.0,relationships

7,Thank you for your response. I've asked him trap questions like Do you like hanging out with your friends more than me? But I haven't really talked about this matter in a rational and constructive manner. And yes I do have a lot of body insecurities; that's probably my biggest hang up. ,2016-06-02 01:42:29+00:00,d3sjyr0,2.0,t1_d3qkfp3,118435.0,relationships
8,"I'm sorry that happened to you, and I really hope it will work out. If you guys are engaged, that means that there's a lot of foundation that's still intact.

12,Thanks so much for your response; it helps to know that I'm not the only one who does this. Do you guys call on the phone then or just meet a few times a week?

15,"Hey, I'm 18 year old, skinny, really small boobs (I hate using the phrase ""no boobs"" because EVERYBODY HAS BOOBS, just in different sizes!). 

Honestly, you sound like you are a really cute, sweet girl! And your sisters sound like the evil stepsisters straight outta Cinderella. They sound like they are really jealous of the fact that you snagged that hot guy &amp; suffering from insecurity problems of their own. 

I assure you that you are really attractive and you caught this boy's attention because of your personality AND your cute looks. And given that his family is into fitness, I wouldn't be surprised if he *prefers* girls who have small boobs and are slim. But it is even more likely that he doesn't care at all about what a girl's body looks like. 

I know how hard it is to have small boobs in a society that glorifies curvy women with huge chests, to be made fun of, etc. But keep your chin up and remember how attractive you are inside and out. Having small boobs is NOT a flaw, just a trait like any other variation in body type.  

Also, don't feel pressured to stuff your bra. It didn't help me with my self esteem issues because I felt like I was lying to the world. Now I avoid bras unless I'm wearing a see-thru shirt. It's so comfortable, and (not to be too graphic) my bf can play with my boobs any time he wants. And if you're wondering, yes he loves them and doesn't judge me for them. 

I hope you have/had a great date and your sisters leave you alone. Feel free to PM me, I'd love to be your friend! :) ",2016-05-30 02:02:17+00:00,d3oomsi,1.0,t3_4ljztv,55373.0,relationships
16,"I don't think you're a failure. You seem articulate and you are smart for identifying what exactly is going on in your head. And that's precisely it -  it's all in your head. Please don't say that ur family just wants ur life insurance, they want u to be ALIVE because ur their FAMILY and you love each other. As for the divorce, youre only 26 and divorcing isn't a failure on ur part, its just a failure of a relationship. And you will definitely be able to make a new relationship eventually or even soon, you never know. Please don't give up, you never know when you'll get a lucky break, or even better - -  when you'll pick yourself off ur feet :) and most importantly, youre not alone. All of us doubt our worth, but u gotta ignore those insecurities and try to find the things in life that make u happy, even if they're only momentary. I hope this helps, and I hope you have a better day tomorrow.",2016-05-18 05:17:09+00:00,d39vk51,1.0,t3_4juzf7,2582.0,depression
17,"Okay I checked the website but I couldn't find the name of the appliance...yeah they should definitely fill you in more if you are feeling left in the dark! i have a bottom applianace that's like a retainer and a top one thats like an expander and once you get used to it it's really not bad.

19,"Is it just on the bottom or the top? They should have also discussed that if after the 12 months it doesn't work u might get surgery. Do you mind giving me your doctor's name? Just curious. You shouldn't be feeling in the dark, if they had given  you a proper consultation you would know what was wrong in the cat scan. 

So basically I had a bottom appliance for about 9 months and my discs didn't move at all so now I'm getting surgery.",2016-05-01 06:10:24+00:00,d2o6dhl,3.0,t1_d2m7mzz,136793.0,TMJ

23,Hmmm i won't be able to do the surgery for a few months so I haven't looked into all the details but if it's going to be the same as yours I'm glad yours was successful.

27,"I'm a girl with scoliosis and I've been with 3 guys, NONE of them have noticed or said anything. If you don't say anything, your gf is probably not even going to notice, so don't be self conscious. As for that girl in the past, my reaction to her rude comment is ""what, you thought he would be an invertebrate?!?!"" 

If you focus on her pleasure more than your insecurity, she will have a great time and even if u were the hunchback of notre dame she wouldn't notice or wouldn't give a shit

Do NOT mention it to her. Trust me. Making a big deal out of something thats not even very noticeable will only bring more attention to it and distract from what u should be focusing on which is expressing ur feelings for each other thru a fun activity

Please please don't be humiliated about your body. It does its job and she's into it because she wants to fuck you, so OWN THAT SHIT",2016-03-11 05:13:48+00:00,d0vnrh7,1.0,t3_49whaj,15084.0,sex

If you live on the east coast and you have the money...I really really recommend seeing Dr. Jeffrey Brown in Vienna, Virginia (sleepandtmjtherapy.com) He's literally the best doctor in the world for TMJ and he's helped me so much (haven't even finished treatment yet so I'm awaiting even more improvement)! I still can't give blowjobs for a long time but at least I can fit it in my mouth :) some other tips for tmj disorder are -- DO NOT get treatment from a regular dentist because they know shit (I wasted money by getting a nightguard from a dentist that only made it worse). Eat soft foods only. No steak. Try not to clench your teeth. Keep your jaw nice and relaxed. Don't do random exercises from online because they don't do anything. And see Dr. Brown if you can....if you're too far then email his office and ask if he knows any TMJ specialists in your area. ",2016-01-17 02:51:59+00:00,cz13o0b,1.0,t3_416mqy,84389.0,sex
