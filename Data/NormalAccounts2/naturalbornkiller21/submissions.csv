I am wreaking havoc on our relationship with my jealousy and insecurity. I have scheduled an appointment to see a therapist soon. 

I often ask my SO things like ""What are you up to?"" or ""Whatcha doing?"" (if he says he's doing something with friends, followed by ""With who?"") in a friendly, curious manner. But now I realize that at least on a subconscious level, I'm worried that he's doing something shady. He's the MOST trustworthy and loyal boyfriend ever, so I admit to being completely irrational. 

So what I'm wondering is, will it help if I stop asking him these questions? I feel like if I were more invested in my own work and hobbies that I wouldn't even feel the need to constantly know what he's doing. I'm worried that if I stop asking these questions, we will text less, and drift apart. Or, will it bring us closer together because my jealousies and insecurities are currently pushing him away in our relationship?

Also, how often do you and your SO text/check up on each other during the day?

**TL;DR** I ask my boyfriend what he's up to a lot because I secretly and irrationally fear he might be doing something shady. If I stop asking him what he's up to in his free time, will it help or hurt our relationship?

I feel so depressed because my family&amp;I put so much time, effort, and money, and I still have to get surgery. I'm especially dreading the long recovery, which will be complicated by the fact that I'm starting college, and after surgery I won't even be done...I'll have to get braces (for the second time). I'm trying to remember that maybe this will take care of my headaches, but I'm just feeling so depressed. My situation could be a LOT worse and I'm fortunate that I can even afford surgery, and a relatively simple one at that. But I'm still struggling to be happy. I would really appreciate some encouragement and hopeful words, or maybe some advice if you've had the surgery. I really want to know that it gets better...Thank you so much. 

tl;dr: I've had a chronic headache for 2 years and spent tons of time and money trying to fix it. However, joints are still slipped so I have to get surgery. Feeling sad and kinda hopeless. Kind words or advice appreciated. Thank you",TMJ,Getting surgery. 18F. Need positive vibes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TMJ/comments/4fjrtw/getting_surgery_18f_need_positive_vibes/
