&gt;Complicating matters for Sanders, while independents can participate in the Democratic primary, they must specifically request a ballot that includes the Democratic presidential primary. About one in five voters in the 2008 Democratic primary were independents, a lower number than in many of the states where Sanders has performed best this year. Sanders supporters have sued to extend a deadline to register with the Democratic Party in order to vote in the presidential contest.

&gt;Data compiled by Paul Mitchell, a Democratic strategist who keeps close tabs on California’s absentee ballot returns, shows 85 percent of the ballots mailed to voters who were not registered with the Democratic Party did not include a presidential ballot test. That, Brokaw said, means thousands of Sanders supporters who did not opt in to the Democratic primary will not have the option to vote for their candidate, unless they make it to the polls in person next Tuesday.

Now a Sanders supporter would say I was callous to call this ""good news,"" but it means a weak independent turnout in California.

Then I went out in the real world. Out here in the real world, I learned that 99 percent of what you learned in graduate school will never be used in the real world.

Out here in the real world, where I've been for several decades, people have paid me very nice money for several decades for the things I write. Those things end up in books and magazines and newspapers. Before I submit something to those nice people, I check all suspect usage with printed, legitimate sources.

When I wander onto Reddit to amuse myself because I've met a deadline and need to kill the rest of the day, I'm less picky about usage. However, because I've lived in the world of print as a professional since before most people here were a sperm, I am somewhat dogmatic about certain syntax, like the word *tabloid*.

A *tabloid* is a rag like the *New York Post* or *The Daily Mail*. A tabloid is *not* a publication where one does not like certain op-ed pieces. I read the *Wall Street Journal* regularly but loathe their op-ed page, which I avoid. However, I would never call the *Journal* a ""tabloid"" because it is not.

He's not doing that any more. He's now trapped in a destructive cycle of self-adoration and pity which has drowned out his original message. This has always been Sanders' weakness and his undoing. Barney Frank said this in the 1990s. [Josh Marshall's piece today](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/it-comes-from-the-very-top) says much the same thing. Bernie Sanders has a martyr complex, and as often happens with people who have martyr complexes, they implode when things don't go their way.

Analysis like this would mean something if it was early in the election season. But it's not. It's the final inning. Sanders desperately needs delegates anywhere he can find them.

Bottom line: he's worse off today than he was on Monday. He's in an even deeper hole. There are only nine races left. He must win every last one of those by the sorts of massive, historic margins he has utterly failed to achieve this entire race.

**2/7/16: Using Images of Veterans in Ads Without Permission**

Valley News: Sanders Scored Over Use of Photos

“With just days before the New Hampshire primary, the presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., is taking heat from Upper Valley residents who say his campaign used their images on mailers without their permission.”

When American Legion state officer Tom Wiley, of Canaan, was called by the Legion’s top officer in New Hampshire, Wiley didn’t know what it was about, but he said the tone of state Cmdr. John Graham made it clear something was wrong.  “He called me, quite straightforwardly, and asked me, had I endorsed any candidate,” Wiley said Saturday. “He asked specifically about Bernie.”

“The Legion’s national offices in Indianapolis quickly turned up a second Sanders campaign flier featuring Holland’s image. According to Wiley, Philip B. Onderdonk, the Legion’s national judge advocate, asked the Sanders campaign to stop using the images, though John Raughter, a national spokesman, declined to comment on the matter, other than to reiterate the Legion’s avoidance of political stances.”

**2/7/16: Using The Image of the Clergy in Ads Without Permission**

Valley News: Sanders Scored Over Use of Photos

The Rev. Stephen R. Silver, pastor of the First Congregational Church of Lebanon, had an experience similar to Wiley’s.  Silver and his 9-year-old son, a Boy Scout, participated in the Veterans Day parade, and posed for a picture with Sanders during the event.  Silver said he was not asked to sign a release form, and had no idea that a picture featuring the three — Silver, his son and Sanders — would be prominently featured in a campaign mailer that he said has been mailed all throughout the state. Silver said the appearance that he endorses Sanders, or any political candidate, compromises his ability to minister to church members.

“I know in our church, we have Democrats, we have Republicans, we have independent voters. They’re all there,” he said. “I want them to know that they can all feel comfortable coming to me.”  After learning his face was on the Sanders mailer, Silver said, he clarified his role to Sunday churchgoers. He also wrote a letter to the Valley News and put a posting on Facebook.  “I do not wish to be seen offering my support to any particular candidate and have asked the Sanders campaign to cease and desist from using this image, in any form, immediately,” Silver wrote in the letter.

**2/4/16: In TV Ad, Falsely Touting Endorsements He Didn’t Receive From New Hampshire Newspapers**

Time: Sanders Campaign Ad Misleadingly Suggests Endorsements A new ad for Bernie Sanders set to play in New Hampshire appears to suggest that two regional newspapers have endorsed the Vermont Senator when in fact, they have not…The editor of the Telegraph, Roger Carroll, said that the paper did not endorse Sanders and called the Sanders ad “deceptive.

Factcheck.org: Sanders’ Deceptive Endorsement Ad: “The Bernie Sanders campaign misappropriates the credibility of two New Hampshire newspapers in a new TV ad that boasts of his endorsements for the Democratic presidential nomination. The ad, titled “Endorsed,” leaves the misleading impression that the Nashua Telegraph and the Valley News endorsed him. They did not. [...] The Sanders campaign is repeating a pattern — first misappropriating the credibility of the Des Moines Register in Iowa and now the Nashua Telegraph and the Valley News in New Hampshire.”

Politifact: Bernie Sanders ad claims or implies endorsements from New Hampshire newspapers: “A Bernie Sanders political ad said he had been endorsed by the Valley News newspaper and implied he had been endorsed by The Telegraph of Nashua. [...] We rate the ad’s claim False.”

**1/29/16: In TV Ad, Falsely Touting Endorsement of Des Moines Register When The Paper Actually Endorsed Hillary Clinton**

New York Times: Bernie Sanders Trumpets Iowa Paper’s Praise. Unsaid? It Endorsed Hillary Clinton  ""The ad trumpets the endorsements Mr. Sanders has received ... But sandwiched between The Nation’s endorsement and one from the The Daily Nonpareil, the local newspaper in Council Bluffs, Iowa, is a quotation from the state’s largest newspaper. “The Des Moines Register calls him ‘a man of courage and principle,’” the narrator says. That praise did not come in an endorsement of Mr. Sanders, however. It came in The Register’s editorial endorsing Mr. Sanders’s rival, Hillary Clinton. The editorial did shower Mr. Sanders with praise, but it came down in favor of Mrs. Clinton’s candidacy – which even careful viewers would have no way of knowing.""

**1/28/16: Campaign Staffers Posing As Union Members To Deceptively Gain Access to Union Dining Halls**

Ralston Reports: Sanders workers are masquerading as Culinary members to campaign inside hotels  Operatives from Bernie Sanders' campaign have donned Culinary union pins and secured access to employee areas inside Strip hotels to try to garner votes for the Feb. 20 caucus, sources confirm.

Culinary officials have been made aware of the faux union workers at four hotels -- The Rio, Paris, The Mirage and Planet Hollywood. The Sanders campaigners are wearing the distinctive yellow Local 226 pins, implying they are union members, to gain access to employee dining rooms. Beyond the obvious deception, union officials surely also are concerned about the implication that the organization has endorsed Sanders despite its recent pledge to remain neutral until after the caucus.

**1/28/16: In Mailers, Falsely Implying Endorsements From AARP and League of Conservation Voters**

MSNBC: “Team Sanders was also accused yesterday of sending out misleading mailers with the AARP logo, which was used without permission.”

Newsweek: Advocacy Groups Call Foul On Sanders Campaign In Iowa, Nevada  ""Sanders’s campaign in Iowa has included League of Conservation Voters and AARP logos in recent mailers it’s sent to prospective caucusgoers, a subtle effort to tie himself to those groups, if not implying an endorsement. But neither group has backed him. The AARP, which represents retirees, does not endorse candidates, and the League of Conservative Voters, an environmental advocacy group, is supporting Sanders’s Democratic foe, Hillary Clinton.""

Quartz: Bernie Sanders’ campaign is getting nailed for some unethical shenanigans “But as Sanders puts more pressure on Clinton, some cracks are emerging in his campaign’s image, raising questions that first came up when Sanders staffers accessed data belonging to the Clinton campaign due to a computer glitch.This week, the Vermont senator’s campaign included the logos of the AARP and the League of Conservation Voters in mailers it sent out to Iowa voters, without the groups’ permission. The AARP is non-partisan and does not support specific candidates, and the League of Conservation Voters has actually endorsed Sanders’ rival, Hillary Clinton.”",2016-04-26 14:25:42+00:00,d2hxihx,3.0,t1_d2hx8gd,393.0,democrats

This is not a conspiracy theory. It's a fact. Bernie Sanders has released close to nothing when it comes to tax returns. He's released less than Republicans running this year. He's released less than Mitt Romney did in 2012.

If Sanders were to be the nominee, failing to release his tax returns would be a big deal, something the GOP would certainly exploit to no end.

554,"It can happen a lot if a campaign doesn't have the right safeguards in place. They should have the right software in place to flag most of these problems (sounds like they don't) and should have staff also manually reviewing any flags thrown down by that software (sounds like they don't). The news reports make it sound like they had a lot more flags by the FEC than usual for a campaign of this size.

A campaign that has problems like this is a sign of a campaign that's badly and ineptly managed and/or doesn't have the right finance people in place. The fact that this is happening to the Sanders campaign is a good sign of the ineptitude we'd see in the Oval Office if they moved on to there (like that would ever happen).

The Sanders campaign has had a lot of management screwups, from the data snooping, to promising position papers long before they become available, to clumsy coverups, to out-of-control volunteers, to fraudulent endorsements, to endless dirty tricks, and now this screwup with their donations.

It all tells me the man at the top is a poor manager in failing to oversee the big strokes as well as failing to hire the right management people. Not exactly what you want to see for someone who needs to manage the largest organization that ever existed on earth (e.g. the US government). Then again, Sanders has no more management experience than running a small city government, not exactly top executive credentials, unlike someone who, say, once ran a State Department or something. ;)",2016-02-27 02:58:24+00:00,d0fexmq,2.0,t1_d0fb6qm,6128.0,hillaryclinton

No win on SuperTues will be able to offset the big losses he will face down south. Texas is third ranked in delegate numbers after CA and NY.

The numbers are very close in MA. He might squeak out a win, but with proportional delegates, he might only end up with four or five more delegates than HRC. He'll almost certainly have a much smaller margin in MA than he did in NH, so his MA delegate number would be close to HC.

Meanwhile, in TX, which has **222* delegates, if HRC pulls in 60-65 percent of the vote like the polls are showing, she'll have a delegate advantage on him in the neighborhood of forty-plus delegates in just that *one* state.

Not to mention GA has *more* delegates than MA and is pulling very strongly for HRC.

My original point was and remains: $15K is not a lot for someone putting in full-time hours. For someone who only works a few hours a month, it's great money.

From the public record, there's not enough information to know how many hours she worked for that pay. Nothing in the public record specifies if it was a full- or part-time job.

The issue for non-Sanders supporters is this: why is a candidate -- who is speaking out against cronyism -- engaging in cronyism himself by hiring his own relatives, particularly his own wife, considering she does not need the money, given she is a former college president who received a $200,000 golden parachute (source link for that below) and Sanders himself makes $174,000 a year as a senator.

660,"&gt; That's assuming democrats don't win more seats in the house during this election cycle 

Because of gerrymandering, that is highly unlikely. That's why the House will almost certainly stay in the GOP's hands until 2022, which will be the first post-census election with new districts. That means whatever Democrat is elected President (and presuming two terms), then 75 percent of that President will have a GOP-controlled House. That's not just my opinion; almost every political professional will tell you that, and such perspective has been widely reported in the media.

The Senate has a good chance to flip in 2016, but without the house, the President must work across the aisle, and Sanders does not have the record that Clinton does on bipartisan cooperation. And, further, Sanders is proposing some sweeping changes the GOP would never allow. They loathe the ACA, but their loathing of single-payer is infinitely much higher. Same for tax hikes, free college, etc. etc. etc.

&gt;He's more than likely going to ask his base come election time to vote democratic, or at least sensible, representatives to the house in both 2016 and 2018 for house and senate elections.

Historically, during midterms, Republicans usually pick up seats when a Democrat is in the White House. So this is a very unrealistic expectation. Obama realized this, and that's why he tried to push through so much during his first two years, because he knew that was his sweet spot.

No. If Janitor Joe at MegaMonolith Inc. gives Reporter Rhonda some of MegaMonolith Inc.'s files, Reporter Rhonda has not committed a criminal act. It does not matter that Janitor Joe has no authorization to do so. Whether or not Janitor Joe committed a criminal act depends on what the records were.

&gt;""My source tells me Bernie Sanders has cancer!!!"" you wouldn't believe it, right?

It depends. If you were a major journalist with a proven track record and reported that ""three sources within the Sanders campaign revealed the candidate has cancer,"" but a campaign spokesperson denied the claim, I would be inclined to believe you and not the spokesperson. Why? Because I've been around the block long enough to know that spokespeople lie all the time -- that's a major part of their job.

The Sanders supporters embrace polls when they're good news for him, but when the polls are bad news (which is most of the time), they discount the polls by saying things like (1) polls are inaccurate and/or (2) it's too early for polls to really matter and/or (3) as soon as more people learn about Sanders, they will ""feel the Bern"" and switch to the Sanders bandwagon. They often say (3) whenever the issue comes up about Sanders' pitiful poll standing with minorities, thus making the inherently racist assumption that minority voters are uninformed and just need things explained to them by the overwhelmingly white Sanders supporters.

736,"&gt;Louisiana has no relevance in a general election.

What does that have to do with anything? These aren't general election polls. The general election doesn't come until *after* the primary.

It doesn't matter in the primary if a state is deeply red or deep blue, because the delegate count is what matters. Whoever reaches 2,118 delegates first is the winner. It doesn't matter if those delegates come from a deep blue or a deep red state.

Louisiana has 56 delegates. New Hampshire has 22. Iowa has 45. So in terms of total delegate count, Louisiana is more important toward reaching the primary win. Additionally, the Louisiana primary is in the first group *after* Super Tuesday, which will help the lead candidate through the closing stretch.

The astounding cluelessness of your comment underscores the fact that many Sanders supporters have no clue about how the primary election process works. They think because they see more Sanders stickers on dormroom doors that somehow means he'll magically win the White House.

Sanders faces a steep uphill -- emphasis *steep* -- climb just to reach the primary finish line. He's behind in 49 states and only ahead in one small state. In many large, delegate-rich states (states with many delegates), he's in third place behind Biden. In most southern states, he's behind Clinton by 30, 40, or even 50, as in Louisiana.

To add further to Sanders' steep climb, he's far, far behind in super-delegate count. Almost 20 percent of the total delegates are super-delegates, those delegates who are not selected in state primaries and caucuses. Of those, Clinton has already locked down a significant majority and Sanders has hardly any. In a state like Louisiana, where he has almost no support, he'll likely have no super-delegates.

**A history of big talk and almost no action.** Sanders regularly introduces legislation that has zero chances of passing. It's grandiose stuff that makes his supporters swoon, but it's just an exercise in tree killing because most of what he introduces is immediately and permanently shelved in committee. He has one of the worst track records on capitol hill as far as introducing or co-sponsoring successful legislation:

http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/09/which-2016-candidate-was-the-most-effective-legislator/

**He does not build coalitions and instead seems determined to alienate people.** Sanders has been running for months now but he still has *zero* endorsements from members of Congress. A successful President reaches out to quarrelsome allies and troublesome foes overseas, as well as on Capitol Hill. He or she must build coalitions, often bipartisan, to tackle tough problems. Sanders' history shows he is incapable of compromise.

**Sanders talks a good game but never provides details about how much his grandiose plans would cost nor how they would be financed.**

Sanders has proposed a lot of very expensive ideas: free college for everyone, free healthcare for everyone, and much more. How much will these cost? Who will pay for them? He and his supporters have an add-water-and-stir answer for that: ""transaction tax"" and ""tax the rich"" and ""tax the greedy corporations."" But those are slogans, not specifics. The Wall Street Journal is out today with a pricetag: $18 trillion. The response from the Sanders supporters? More cheerleading for Bernie with happy talk about ""taxing the rich"" and ""taxing greed"":

790,"&gt;  there is a difference in what for-profit companies pay their workers to produce the value that the company is based on and what someone, politician or no

As a matter of law, this is flatly incorrect.

Whether or not an employer is for-profit, not-for-profit, or non-profit makes no difference in labor law; minimum wage law applies across the board to all of them. The employer's tax status is irrelevant and isn't even considered in the equation. Types of *jobs* can be exempted or subjected to a reduced minimum wage, because of other compensation like gratuities, but again this distinction does not depend on the tax structure of the employer. Examples of the latter would be food servers.

So it doesn't matter if it's Exxon-Mobil or a non-profit homeless shelter that employs workers to assist the homeless; both employers must pay wages that meet or exceed the minimum wage.

In short, Bernie Sanders currently would be in violation of the law he seeks to impose.

That is an English-language term coined by the English-language press in the 1920s, a somewhat sloppy translation of *Nationalsozialismus*. *Nationalsozialismus* incorporates the German concept of *Volksgemeinschaft*, or a society led by all German peoples. *Nationalsozialismus* was both anti-socialist and anti-capitalist. It was also pro-business, pro-private property, and anti-collective bargaining, the exact opposite of socialist perspectives on these three issues. That's why when Jewish-owned businesses and property were seized, they were given to or sold to people and businesses and not held by the state, as would have occurred with socialism. Labor unions were broken up in Nazi Germany and union activists -- often socialists -- were imprisoned or executed.

Hitler regularly and repeatedly denounced socialism, communism, Marxism, and Bolshevism. He continuously preached that socialism and Judaism were intertwined and that anti-Semitic action was necessary to stomp out socialism.

805,"&gt;  why you disagree with campaign funding reform

Stepping out of snark mode for the moment, you'll see I never said anything even resembling that in my comments. I think campaign funding reform is a fantastic idea. The way to start that is with a Democrat in the White House and Democratic control of both houses of Congress. Then they would start the process to amend the Constitution to kill the idea of non-persons (like corporations, PACs, etc.) having so-called free speech rights.

&gt; trying to tweak the conversation away from the issue

The issue, my friend, is why no members of Congress have endorsed Bernie Sanders. You, my friend, are the one who tweaked off into different directions *away* from that topic. ;)

&gt;Where can I meet actual people who does have some solid concerns regarding Bernies policies that I should be aware of and think about.

That is because Reddit is heavily populated by left-leaning younger straight white males, and Bernie Sanders' primary support group is left-leaning younger straight white males.

Step back jack! How dare I use sarcasm in a subreddit founded in sarcasm! Oh the outrage!

Oops! Somebody doesn't understand political finance laws. (Oops, sarcasm again! Bad me!) Candidates may only receive donations from people out of their personal funds. Corporations cannot donate to candidates. Corporate special interests groups, whatever that is (stop it with the sarcasm there pal!), cannot donate to candidates, either. They have to be flesh-and-blood people, not the ""corporations are people too"" people that so confused poor Willard Romney. (Possibly *appropriate* sarcasm here about an unrelated person not likely to be endorsing either Clinton or Sanders.)

&gt;unions are not corporations

Oops! Somebody doesn't understand labor law and corporate law. (Bad me, resorting to sarcasm again!) Unions routinely incorporate as corporations so they may engage in certain business practices like open bank accounts, own real estate, own chattels, and all that good stuff.

&gt;Hillary was on Wal-Marts board of directors

My goodness, once again somebody has wandered off topic to scripted talking points without addressing the question of why exactly zero members of Congress have endorsed Sanders. (Sarcasm alert!) Scripted talking points! How inside politics! (Sarcasm again!)

(Aside to self: notice all the people who trot out this Walmart talking point *never mention* whether the issue of union representation was ever before the board of directors during Clinton's stint and, if so, how she voted on any such matters or what comments she made.)

&gt;But why is she considered the superior candidate?

I guess you would have to ask them, oui?

Meanwhile, the question remains unanswered in this entire thread, notwithstanding the blizzard of off-topic scripted talking points meant to distract attention from the issue: why has no member of Congress endorsed Bernie Sanders when a *record number* have endorsed Hillary Clinton?

(Hmmm, methinks I will get more off-topic scripted talking points in response while the poor question goes unanswered.)
