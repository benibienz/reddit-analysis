Like most rational people, I believe polls have great value in politics. They're not precise, but they're somewhat accurate far more often than not. For the most part, quality polls this year have been on the money. The only big surprise was Michigan, but that happened because of the state's polling uniqueness and not because polls as a whole are problematic.

The polls for April 26 are looking very, very bad for Bernie Sanders. He will lose Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Connecticut. He almost certainly will lose Delaware, because that state votes similarly to Pennsylvania. His only hope is Rhode Island, the next to smallest population state of the five in the running on that day, but he wouldn't win by much and with no delegate advantage to offset the other four states.

Right now, even before April 26, Sanders has no hope. He can't win it with pledged delegates; Clinton will win the majority. Even if every last super delegate went over to his camp, he still couldn't win it.

After April 26, his odds become nonexistent. He will have utterly no road forward.

Yes, he's saying he'll go all the way to the convention floor, but candidates always say that kind of crap. It's a big empty bag of nothing.

He needs to drop out April 27. He needs to do it for the party and he needs to do it to let his people down gently and prepare them for the fall election. He needs to bring the party together and to stop bleeding his donors for any more money.

The question is: will he? If he doesn't, then hopefully people will really start to pressure him publicly to drop out, because otherwise he's achieving nothing and is becoming increasingly destructive.

Yes, in 2008, Clinton and Obama went all the way to June. But that was then and this is now, and this race is not that race. Clinton and Obama were much closer and she was still winning important states. The writing was not on the wall then like it is now.

So I'm curious about other people's gut feeling on this -- will he drop out shortly after April 26?",hillaryclinton,Serious Question - Will Bernie Sanders Drop Out After April 26?,https://www.reddit.com/r/hillaryclinton/comments/4fo3uv/serious_question_will_bernie_sanders_drop_out/

He's been shitting the bed all this week and the New Yawk media has been brutal on him. He's running in the state where his opponent won thrice statewide, twice in a landslide. He has never won a closed primary, and New Yawk is a closed primary. He is polling ~20 points behind. The state has lots of diversity, which always hurts him. And its biggest industry is Wall Street, the very same industry Bernie has been pissing all over since like 1965. Not just billionaires work on Wall Street; lots of ordinary voters do, too.

**So let's say** he loses New Yawk by about 20 points. That would put him about 50-60 delegates further behind. It would also kill the whole ""momentum"" fairy story and knock him down even further in the five Northeast primaries in the following week, four of which are the damning closed primaries.

But when he puts is last two twenties on the table, she scoops them up, blows him a kiss, and disappears behind the shimmering curtain, never to be seen again.

After Michigan, their hopes ran so high that they would score, but then their money was gone, the lights came up, and they realized Ohio, Illinois, and Missouri were nowhere to be seen.

Five of the original seventeen Republican candidates for president in 2016 released various tax returns for various years. On the Democratic side, two of the original six candidates released various tax returns for various years.

Hillary Clinton released fifteen years worth of complete tax returns, from 2000 to 2014.

Bernie Sanders released only one year of partial tax returns -- 2014 -- and did not release any of the attachments, like what charitable donations he made (if any) and what deductions he took. (We know he took deductions above the standard level because of the relevant line on the partial return that he released.)

So this leaves us wondering: **What is Bernie Sanders Hiding? Why won't he release more tax returns? Why didn't he release his full 2014 return?**

We understand. We really do. Some of us were young and stupid once, too. Of course, that doesn't help the BernieBros who are not young. We've seen you at Whole Foods with your battered Volvos and thin, gray ponytails. The sixties are over guys. Seriously.

So back to the pep talk. No candidate is worth bankrupting yourself. Oh, er, that's right, some of you have *already* bankrupted yourselves supporting Bernie, so disregard this part. For those of you who still have a few dollars to send to Bernie, don't do it. Go watch some nice free online porn or something.

For those of you who feel all hope is lost, remember, suicide is not the answer. No candidate is worth your life.

Maybe because more and more people are realizing that Saint Bernard is a one-trick pony who would wreck our economy and our nation. Who knows. Just keep coming and participating.

This week may be a very exciting week. The Sanders Campaign is in a very bad place in the Super Tuesday races and their losses are gonna be YUGE! So we'll probably see even more activity here when the BernieBro mass hangover takes hold.

Sanders has also imploded in Iowa and is running 30-40 points behind there, and the majority of New Hampshire polls since the debates show he's now losing there, too.

Here is the complete article:

NEWTON, Iowa— Bernie Sanders fires up huge crowds with a populist stump speech, but the Vermont senator is much less likely to engage in the question-and-answer sessions with voters that have come to define presidential politics in such early states as Iowa and New Hampshire.

Most of his “town meetings” allow for no questions, and when he does take them, his answers to queries outside the central themes of his campaign are often brief or vague as he segues back to points about income inequality and the plight of the middle class.

In 19 events billed as town meetings in August and September, Mr. Sanders took questions at five of them. He gave a speech but didn’t take questions, as is the custom for candidates, at the Des Moines Register “soap box” at the Iowa State Fair.

Kim Major, who saw him in Manchester, N.H., came into the event undecided between Mr. Sanders and Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, and remained so afterward. Ms. Major said she wants to know more about his views on foreign policy, among other things. “One of the reasons Sanders resonates with me is I do believe income inequality is a large issue in the United States,” she said. “Unfortunately, that’s been 75% of his campaign, and that can only take him so far when you’re moving onto the national stage.”

After bursting onto the primary-race stage by drawing huge crowds, Mr. Sanders’s campaign has been working furiously to build a larger infrastructure to take advantage of his rise in the polls. He is in first place in New Hampshire and is closing on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Iowa. Yet that standing could erode if Mr. Sanders isn’t more responsive to early-state voters who pride themselves on vetting candidates’ readiness for office.

In an interview, Tad Devine, senior campaign strategist, said the campaign is considering adding events to Mr. Sanders’s schedule which has included rallies with as many as 20,000 people. “We’ll try to get more and more formats where we can answer more and more questions,” said Mr. Devine, adding that the voters expect it. “We have a candidate who likes to do that.”

Some presidential candidates—like Sen. John McCain in 2008—have made town-hall meetings a central part of their campaigns. Others rarely participate in them, such as Republican businessman Donald Trump. When he does take questions, he rarely offers replies in any detail to the questions asked.

Mr. Sanders, who has served in Congress for more than two decades, isn’t lacking for expertise. His stump speech is stuffed with data and policy prescriptions on income inequality, Wall Street regulation, health care, climate change and campaign finance. His staffers say he has participated in countless town-hall meetings over his political career in Vermont.

Spokesman Michael Briggs said Mr. Sanders isn’t able at times to linger during question periods because his schedule is packed tight, though he does regularly take questions from the media. “I suppose he could give a shorter speech and take more questions, and that might be something we look at,” he said.

At a recent town meeting here, Mr. Sanders spent about an hour on his opening remarks, and about 12 minutes taking audience questions.

The first came from an elementary schoolteacher who said too much of the joy had been drained from classrooms. She asked what the federal role in education should be and what criteria Mr. Sanders would use to choose an education secretary. Mr. Sanders said he agreed that school needs to be about more than testing, but he didn’t offer specifics on the other questions.

A week earlier, in Manchester, N.H., he was asked about the territorial dispute in the South China Sea between China and its neighbors. Mr. Sanders said the U.S. should work with other countries to let China know its expansionism is unacceptable—and then pivoted to his opposition to the Iraq war and support for the Iran nuclear deal.

Another woman asked about how to make treatment affordable for drug and alcohol addiction. He replied by affirming that there is a serious problem and then talked about problems with the nation’s health-care system, such as insurance company profits.

Neil Levesque, executive director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College, who attended a Manchester town meeting, said he noticed those scant replies. “It was interesting that he didn’t have those answers and didn’t seem as comfortable,” he said. “This may trip him up in a debate when you just don’t know what kind of pitch the moderator is going to send your way.”

At the Newton town hall, several people said they wished he had spent more time on Q&amp;A, and some said they found his responses vague. “He kind of stumbled around in the area of education,” said Janna Skinner, 34. But others came away impressed. “I thought he did extremely well,” said Linda Bryant, who teaches pipe organ in Newton. As for audience participation, she said, “I just wish there had been more of it.”

Spokesman Michael Briggs said Mr. Sanders isn’t able at times to linger during question periods because his schedule is packed tight, though he does regularly take questions from the media. “I suppose he could give a shorter speech and take more questions, and that might be something we look at,” he said.

At a recent town meeting here, Mr. Sanders spent about an hour on his opening remarks, and about 12 minutes taking audience questions.

The first came from an elementary schoolteacher who said too much of the joy had been drained from classrooms. She asked what the federal role in education should be and what criteria Mr. Sanders would use to choose an education secretary. Mr. Sanders said he agreed that school needs to be about more than testing, but he didn’t offer specifics on the other questions.

A week earlier, in Manchester, N.H., he was asked about the territorial dispute in the South China Sea between China and its neighbors. Mr. Sanders said the U.S. should work with other countries to let China know its expansionism is unacceptable—and then pivoted to his opposition to the Iraq war and support for the Iran nuclear deal.

Another woman asked about how to make treatment affordable for drug and alcohol addiction. He replied by affirming that there is a serious problem and then talked about problems with the nation’s health-care system, such as insurance company profits.

Neil Levesque, executive director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College, who attended a Manchester town meeting, said he noticed those scant replies. “It was interesting that he didn’t have those answers and didn’t seem as comfortable,” he said. “This may trip him up in a debate when you just don’t know what kind of pitch the moderator is going to send your way.”

At the Newton town hall, several people said they wished he had spent more time on Q&amp;A, and some said they found his responses vague. “He kind of stumbled around in the area of education,” said Janna Skinner, 34. But others came away impressed. “I thought he did extremely well,” said Linda Bryant, who teaches pipe organ in Newton. As for audience participation, she said, “I just wish there had been more of it.”

WASHINGTON—Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose liberal call to action has propelled his long-shot presidential campaign, is proposing an array of new programs that would amount to the largest peacetime expansion of government in modern American history.
In all, he backs at least $18 trillion in new spending over a decade, according to a tally by The Wall Street Journal, a sum that alarms conservatives and gives even many Democrats pause. Mr. Sanders sees the money as going to essential government services at a time of increasing strain on the middle class.

His agenda includes an estimated $15 trillion for a government-run health-care program that covers every American, plus large sums to rebuild roads and bridges, expand Social Security and make tuition free at public colleges.

To pay for it, Mr. Sanders, a Vermont independent running for the Democratic nomination, has so far detailed tax increases that could bring in as much as $6.5 trillion over 10 years, according to his staff.

A campaign aide said additional tax proposals would be offered to offset the cost of some, and possibly all, of his health program. A Democratic proposal for such a “single-payer” health plan, now in Congress, would be funded in part through a new payroll tax on employers and workers, with the trade-off being that employers would no longer have to pay for or arrange their workers’ insurance.

Mr. Sanders declined a request for an interview. His campaign referred questions to Warren Gunnels, his policy director, who said the programs would address an array of problems. “Sen. Sanders’s agenda does cost money,” he said. “If you look at the problems that are out there, it’s very reasonable.”
Calling himself a democratic socialist, Mr. Sanders has long stood to the left of the Democratic Party, and at first he was dismissed as little more than a liberal gadfly to the party’s front-runner, Hillary Clinton. But he is ahead of or tied with the former secretary of state in the early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire, and he has gained in national polling. He stands as her most serious challenger for the Democratic nomination.

Mr. Sanders has filled arenas with thousands of supporters, where he thunders an unabashedly liberal agenda to tackle pervasive economic inequality through more government services, higher taxes on the wealthy and new constraints on banks and corporations.

“One of the demands of my campaign is that we think big and not small,” he said in a recent speech to the Democratic National Committee.
Enacting his program would be difficult, if not impossible, given that Republican control of the House appears secure for the foreseeable future. Some of his program would be too liberal for even some centrist Democrats. Still, his agenda articulates the goals of many liberals and is exerting a leftward pressure on the party’s 2016 field.

The Sanders program amounts to increasing total federal spending by about one-third—to a projected $68 trillion or so over 10 years.

For many years, government spending has equaled about 20% of gross domestic product annually; his proposals would increase that to about 30% in their first year. As a share of the economy, that would represent a bigger increase in government spending than the New Deal or Great Society and is surpassed in modern history only by the World War II military buildup.

By way of comparison, the 2009 economic stimulus program was estimated at $787 billion when it passed Congress, and President George W. Bush’s 2001 tax cuts were estimated to cost the federal treasury $1.35 trillion over 10 years.

Sen. Bernie Sanders spoke to students at Liberty University on Monday. The hottest topic: birth control. Photo: AP Mrs. Clinton so far has proposed programs that together would cost an estimated $650 billion over 10 years. Her college-affordability plan is estimated at $350 billion over 10 years, and an expected child-care proposal is estimated to cost at least $200 billion. Those are modest sums next to Mr. Sanders’s agenda.
He proposes $1 trillion to repair roads, bridges and airports. His college-affordability program would cost $750 billion over a decade. Smaller programs would provide youth jobs and prevent cuts to private pension plans. He would raise an additional $1.2 trillion in Social Security taxes in order to increase benefits and pay those already promised for 50 years. That would bolster the program but fall short of the 75 years of solvency that is typically what policy makers aim to achieve.

Mr. Sanders says he also would propose an expansion of federal support for child care and preschool, though he hasn’t said how much those programs would cost, and they aren’t included in this total.

His most expensive proposal, by far, is his plan to extend Medicare, the federal health program for seniors, to all Americans.

Mr. Sanders hasn’t released a detailed plan, but a similar proposal in Congress, sponsored by Rep. John Conyers (D., Mich.), would require $15 trillion in federal spending over 10 years, on top of existing federal health spending, according to an analysis of the plan by Gerald Friedman, an economist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. Mr. Conyers’s office referred questions about the plan to Mr. Friedman.

Mr. Gunnels, the Sanders aide, said the campaign hasn’t worked out all details on his plan—for instance, his version might allow each state to run its own single-payer system. But he said the $15 trillion figure was a fair estimate.

Single-payer health care has long been on the liberal wish list, but it has never had sufficient support in Congress. Proponents say it is the best way to guarantee coverage to every American—something that the Affordable Care Act falls short of—and lower overall costs.
The Conyers plan, for instance, assumes significant savings by allowing the government to negotiate for prescription-drug prices, and it would rely on the new payroll taxes for funding.

Mr. Sanders and some Democrats see the 2010 health law as a good first step, but they say more needs to be done. Many other Democrats, scarred from the fight over the ACA and seeing it as a major step forward, are ready to move on to other issues.

So far, the tax increases Mr. Sanders has proposed are concentrated on Americans earning at least $250,000 a year and on corporations. They include increases in the capital-gains tax, the estate tax and personal income-tax rates for the wealthiest Americans. He also would impose a fee on financial transactions, with investment companies taxed on every stock they trade.

Taken together, these proposals are attractive to many Democrats, said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, and would transform the U.S. into an economy much more like those in Europe, with a significantly larger share of economic activity in government hands. “It’s not the model we employ [in the U.S.], but it is a viable economic model,” he said. Still, he cautioned the revenue would have to come from the middle class as well as the wealthy.

More-centrist Democrats think it is a bad idea. “We are not a country that has limitless resources. You need to tamp on the brakes somewhere, but he doesn’t,” said Jim Kessler, senior vice president for policy at the Democratic think tank Third Way. “There’s no such thing as free college; somebody is going to be paying for it.”

Conservative economists say higher government spending would hurt long-term economic growth and that this much would stunt it altogether. “If we’re putting our resources into government, that’s a place where you’re not going to get productivity gains,” said Kevin Hassett, an American Enterprise Institute analyst who has advised many GOP presidential candidates but is unaffiliated this year. Mr. Hassett said the tax increases required to pay for the Sanders program would be “massively catastrophic.”

Even many Democrats say such a plan would be politically infeasible. Austan Goolsbee, an economist at the University of Chicago and former adviser to President Barack Obama, recalled the difficulty winning congressional approval for the stimulus and health legislation at a time of large Democratic majorities in Congress.

“Much, much more modest actions than those Bernie Sanders is describing were extremely heavy lifts, and many thought impossible,” he said. “Both of them came down to a single vote.”",AnybodyButBernie,Price Tag of Bernie Sanders’s Proposals: $18 Trillion,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnybodyButBernie/comments/3l1jxb/price_tag_of_bernie_sanderss_proposals_18_trillion/

WASHINGTON—Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose liberal call to action has propelled his long-shot presidential campaign, is proposing an array of new programs that would amount to the largest peacetime expansion of government in modern American history.
In all, he backs at least $18 trillion in new spending over a decade, according to a tally by The Wall Street Journal, a sum that alarms conservatives and gives even many Democrats pause. Mr. Sanders sees the money as going to essential government services at a time of increasing strain on the middle class.

His agenda includes an estimated $15 trillion for a government-run health-care program that covers every American, plus large sums to rebuild roads and bridges, expand Social Security and make tuition free at public colleges.

To pay for it, Mr. Sanders, a Vermont independent running for the Democratic nomination, has so far detailed tax increases that could bring in as much as $6.5 trillion over 10 years, according to his staff.

A campaign aide said additional tax proposals would be offered to offset the cost of some, and possibly all, of his health program. A Democratic proposal for such a “single-payer” health plan, now in Congress, would be funded in part through a new payroll tax on employers and workers, with the trade-off being that employers would no longer have to pay for or arrange their workers’ insurance.

Mr. Sanders declined a request for an interview. His campaign referred questions to Warren Gunnels, his policy director, who said the programs would address an array of problems. “Sen. Sanders’s agenda does cost money,” he said. “If you look at the problems that are out there, it’s very reasonable.”
Calling himself a democratic socialist, Mr. Sanders has long stood to the left of the Democratic Party, and at first he was dismissed as little more than a liberal gadfly to the party’s front-runner, Hillary Clinton. But he is ahead of or tied with the former secretary of state in the early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire, and he has gained in national polling. He stands as her most serious challenger for the Democratic nomination.

Mr. Sanders has filled arenas with thousands of supporters, where he thunders an unabashedly liberal agenda to tackle pervasive economic inequality through more government services, higher taxes on the wealthy and new constraints on banks and corporations.

“One of the demands of my campaign is that we think big and not small,” he said in a recent speech to the Democratic National Committee.
Enacting his program would be difficult, if not impossible, given that Republican control of the House appears secure for the foreseeable future. Some of his program would be too liberal for even some centrist Democrats. Still, his agenda articulates the goals of many liberals and is exerting a leftward pressure on the party’s 2016 field.

The Sanders program amounts to increasing total federal spending by about one-third—to a projected $68 trillion or so over 10 years.

For many years, government spending has equaled about 20% of gross domestic product annually; his proposals would increase that to about 30% in their first year. As a share of the economy, that would represent a bigger increase in government spending than the New Deal or Great Society and is surpassed in modern history only by the World War II military buildup.

By way of comparison, the 2009 economic stimulus program was estimated at $787 billion when it passed Congress, and President George W. Bush’s 2001 tax cuts were estimated to cost the federal treasury $1.35 trillion over 10 years.

Sen. Bernie Sanders spoke to students at Liberty University on Monday. The hottest topic: birth control. Photo: AP Mrs. Clinton so far has proposed programs that together would cost an estimated $650 billion over 10 years. Her college-affordability plan is estimated at $350 billion over 10 years, and an expected child-care proposal is estimated to cost at least $200 billion. Those are modest sums next to Mr. Sanders’s agenda.
He proposes $1 trillion to repair roads, bridges and airports. His college-affordability program would cost $750 billion over a decade. Smaller programs would provide youth jobs and prevent cuts to private pension plans. He would raise an additional $1.2 trillion in Social Security taxes in order to increase benefits and pay those already promised for 50 years. That would bolster the program but fall short of the 75 years of solvency that is typically what policy makers aim to achieve.

Mr. Sanders says he also would propose an expansion of federal support for child care and preschool, though he hasn’t said how much those programs would cost, and they aren’t included in this total.

His most expensive proposal, by far, is his plan to extend Medicare, the federal health program for seniors, to all Americans.

Mr. Sanders hasn’t released a detailed plan, but a similar proposal in Congress, sponsored by Rep. John Conyers (D., Mich.), would require $15 trillion in federal spending over 10 years, on top of existing federal health spending, according to an analysis of the plan by Gerald Friedman, an economist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. Mr. Conyers’s office referred questions about the plan to Mr. Friedman.

Mr. Gunnels, the Sanders aide, said the campaign hasn’t worked out all details on his plan—for instance, his version might allow each state to run its own single-payer system. But he said the $15 trillion figure was a fair estimate.

Single-payer health care has long been on the liberal wish list, but it has never had sufficient support in Congress. Proponents say it is the best way to guarantee coverage to every American—something that the Affordable Care Act falls short of—and lower overall costs.
The Conyers plan, for instance, assumes significant savings by allowing the government to negotiate for prescription-drug prices, and it would rely on the new payroll taxes for funding.

Mr. Sanders and some Democrats see the 2010 health law as a good first step, but they say more needs to be done. Many other Democrats, scarred from the fight over the ACA and seeing it as a major step forward, are ready to move on to other issues.

So far, the tax increases Mr. Sanders has proposed are concentrated on Americans earning at least $250,000 a year and on corporations. They include increases in the capital-gains tax, the estate tax and personal income-tax rates for the wealthiest Americans. He also would impose a fee on financial transactions, with investment companies taxed on every stock they trade.

Taken together, these proposals are attractive to many Democrats, said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, and would transform the U.S. into an economy much more like those in Europe, with a significantly larger share of economic activity in government hands. “It’s not the model we employ [in the U.S.], but it is a viable economic model,” he said. Still, he cautioned the revenue would have to come from the middle class as well as the wealthy.

More-centrist Democrats think it is a bad idea. “We are not a country that has limitless resources. You need to tamp on the brakes somewhere, but he doesn’t,” said Jim Kessler, senior vice president for policy at the Democratic think tank Third Way. “There’s no such thing as free college; somebody is going to be paying for it.”

Conservative economists say higher government spending would hurt long-term economic growth and that this much would stunt it altogether. “If we’re putting our resources into government, that’s a place where you’re not going to get productivity gains,” said Kevin Hassett, an American Enterprise Institute analyst who has advised many GOP presidential candidates but is unaffiliated this year. Mr. Hassett said the tax increases required to pay for the Sanders program would be “massively catastrophic.”

Even many Democrats say such a plan would be politically infeasible. Austan Goolsbee, an economist at the University of Chicago and former adviser to President Barack Obama, recalled the difficulty winning congressional approval for the stimulus and health legislation at a time of large Democratic majorities in Congress.

Anyone who was half awake during civics class knows there are only two ways to amend the US Constitution: (1) Congress can approve an amendment by a two-thirds vote, which then must be ratified by three-fourth of the states (38 states) or (2) two-thirds of the states (34 states) can approve a resolution calling for a constitutional convention to amend the Constitution. In our Constitution's history, it has been amended a number of times with the first process but never with the second.

The President has nothing to do with this. He (or she) is powerless through the entire process. If Congress passes the resolution by the first method, it automatically goes to the states for ratification consideration. It never passes through his (or her) hands. No possibility of a Presidential veto exists. The President cannot stop the process nor slow it in any way.

So how exactly would President Bernie Sanders achieve this magical overturning of Citizens United via the Oval Office, which plays utterly no part in the process?

Add to this the near certainty that, because of gerrymandering, the House of Representatives likely will continue to have a Republican majority after the 2016 election. How likely would two-thirds of a Republican-controlled House vote to approve a constitutional amendment being promoted by a President Sanders?

Of course, we must consider state politics in this process, too. Let's say, somehow, Congress approves this amendment to overturn Citizens United. Right now, nearly half of the states (at least 23) have both legislative houses controlled by Republicans. Another 20 have Republican control of one house. Only seven have both houses controlled by Democrats. So how likely would a Democrat-proposed Constitutional amendment pass these many GOP-controlled legislatures, some of which are in deeply red states?

So the likelihood of a Constitutional amendment via this process is close to zero. That leaves the only possibility through the Supreme Court again.

Now Sanders has said he'll only nominate justices to the Supreme Court who pledge to overturn Citizens United. Putting aside for a moment the wisdom of litmus tests for nominees, five justices would have to vote to overturn it. Few two-term Presidents have ever been able to fill more than three seats during an eight-year term. Sanders would be 73 if he was elected President. We can see right here the numbers aren't working in his favor.

So let's stir partisan politics into this mix. Let's say Sanders is elected. Who's to say the Senate will confirm Supreme Court nominees who have agreed to a litmus test? What if the Senate is still Republican controlled?

Even on the very slim chance that a President Sanders could fill the necessary number of Supreme Court justices, they cannot just walk into court and overturn Citizens United. They must wait for a case to come before them. That would take several years at a minimum. And the Supreme Court takes less than one percent of the cases appealed to them.

Hence, we can see, the chance of Citizen United being overturned anytime soon is about as close to zero as you can get. Yet Sanders is promising to do this.

There we see the heart of the problem with Bernie Sanders. He makes pretty promises. But the reality is they're nothing more than promises he cannot fulfill. His legislative record is proof of this. He makes snappy Twitter posts. He organizes sit-ins and protests! He makes lovely speeches, and proposes big changes. And then nothing happens. What major pieces of legislation has Bernie Sanders introduced that have passed? The answer? Almost nothing.
