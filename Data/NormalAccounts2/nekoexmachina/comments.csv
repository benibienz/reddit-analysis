point-by-point:

1) Bernie Sanders did everything he could to save HRC, going against his interests, and failed, because she is a shitty person and a shitty politician.

3) May be one should not commit felony? 

4) Was debunked numerous times.

5) Replace Trump with HRC and that would be true. (HRC ran her campain on basis that everyone is racist, sexist and mysoginist and therefore she  needs to be elected.. not mr. President)

6) So now you say your colledge, that basically is brainwashing people into communist braindead zombies, brainwashes people into braindead zombies, and then they can't make an argument, and then they loose? First adequate thought in the whole rant.

305,"&gt;even in the realm of theoretical speculation.

Because with valid source of information discussion moves from realm theoretical speculation (which is usually ending up by somebody yelling ""sexist"") to a realm of actual discussion.

&gt;Now the question to ask is why is it that the lowest among the group is the one that never tells people their status?

I'd say that this is because of lack of out-of-proportion ego. I mean, a person with ego so big that they ""always point out"" that they are a TS person would be disliked more by any human being. If I would go around telling people I'm a male, at some point I'll find myself isolated in a small group of lunatics. Which probably would make my life miserable.


&gt;I mean hell, what would your instinct be if a family member decided to switch genders on you? 

Yeah, I'd freak out ofc. 

&gt;That's not an uncommon or really unreasonable reaction to something like that and it leads to isolation which leads to suicides. 

I do not think that this is the actual cause. IMHO, actual cause is the lack of psychotherapy after the hormone therapy.

I mean, if I have a body that reacts this and that to that set of hormones, and then I get those hormones mixed up with something that is alien to me, I'd probably be feeling quite odd for a long while, and in this period a therapist help must be enforced or strongly recomended.

&gt;Because of the social isolation that exists from simply looking different- looking odd.

Nope again, it is in their character. For some reason people decide that after a huge change in there life, that changes how every single other person sees them, they do not need professional help, there go the results. 

&gt;And according to a majority of society, yeah someone going through hormone therapy is probably going to look a bit odd and will be isolated by society as a result.

Me might be a minority but I do not really care how a person looks. I care, however, about how person behaves. (answered earlier in post)

&gt;I would still like to know what they do not seek to solve exactly.

Personal issues. Big thing of every single SJW/femi `movement` about obese, TS, racial issues, gamer issues, whatever else is about ""be yourself and learn to enjoy it and shove it into society's face"".

Back in 2003 (or something) me and my mom went to Italy.  I spoke English freely at that time already, but no knowledge of any other languages.
We both enjoy ourselves cycling around - thats our main tourist activity for 80% of the time. So, we start of at 10 o'clock in the morning, from our Hotel in some small Italian beach village, and we ride and ride and ride. Fastforward to 15~ or something like it, we're at some other village in the middle of nowhere. The sights and nature's good, so we're fine, but we're starting to starve a bit. We go to the only restaurant in the only hotel in the said village. 
I ask mr waiter if he speaks english, he answers me ""No no, sorry italia"" with very hard accent. Okay, well, we try to read up the italian menu, and understand what meal is made of what, try to ask the guy some questions, but he goes again with terrible accent and ""No no italia"". Alright, no problem, we just order something that sounds nice and presumably has meat in it. Little bit later, a couple gets into the room we're sitting in. The said waiter jumps right into them, and start talking in **perfect** english: ""Hello, mr and ms &lt;Name&gt;, welcome back, I hope your trip was nice! For today, I can recommend you this and that and whatnot"". Seconds later, he realize we hear him, and looks straight into my eyes and tells, blushing a bit: ""*Ooooooooopsie*"". I just couldn't stop laughing at his expression, and he told us later he planned some joke on us, but kinda failed.

Alright, now to Czech. I have never ever had negative experience with Czech people, and most of them love that a foreigner guy learned their language and is able to speak to them. One of my friends, however, has had an unpleasant event on the plane when he was flying Prague-&gt;Moscow. He sits down, czech couple gets two seats near him. A man tells to his wife: ""Oh they sat us with a russian pig again"", and when my friend answers ""You know I understand czech"", the  guy told him ""Its even worse this way!"". In the end, the couple asked to exchange seats with someone, and they got away.

2) outdated, 2011. people views might evolve, need a more up-to-date speech video if you really want to play this card. 

&gt;He promotes the idea that meaningless, arbitrary lines on a map should be enforced. 

leave this up to you ppl; can't say how ""meaningless"" is the idea without being in USA.
But got a point from my PoV (*) and a  question for you: so, if Ukraine would build a wall between itself (eastern part) and Ru, would it be same ""meaningless, arbitrary line""? (for the record - while being from Ru, I think that Ru has started all of the shit on the East, and I do not think that Ru is doing anything good to stop or even defuse the situation).

(*): in Ru, I think we actually should block our borders with the post-soviet world. The lack of borders promote a [lot of shit](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3474467/Nanny-decapitated-three-year-old-child-paraded-head-streets-says-did-avenge-Muslims-killed-Putin-s-air-strikes-Syria.html) to happen, and honest people who want to work would not suffer (cm'on, some hours spent once a year to get your proper visa is not ""suffering"" nor is it ""opression"").

I was having similiar fun in Dwarf Fortress about a release ago. I've played an Adventurer, a big badass with giant axe. So, first thing I got in brand new world was a goblin ambush. I was a martial master, so I've knocked out everybody, and chopped off right foots from every single one of them.
So I run around, questing and killing stuff, and get ambushed yet again. By the same band of goblins. Alright, this time I kill everyone but their leader, and chop off arm of their leader. Next ambush - leader is there! no arm, no foot, new army.

Poor little guy was trying to get his revenge on me till he had no limbs left. I felt a bit sad after chopping his last limb off, as I thought we won't meet again, but only 1 in-game day later he showed up again. This time, he just passed out after I've killed all of his mercenaries, so I left him there, and a day later I got killed by a cyclops. Other adventurers in same world never met the cripple.

Now I think that Texas seems to be a bastion of sanity, based on news coming from your country.

I don't live in America, in fact, I'm as far (both geographically and politically) from it as I can get without getting to NK or arabic countries :) (I was born in Russia; now I'm not there but that's not the point).

 In russia, we've started to have same shit going on in ~2012 I think; but that shit came from other point of view - the *law-enforced* ""feelings of believers"" (not sure whats the proper word for non-atheist ) that forbid you saying shit like ""god doesn't exist"". There was actually a law suite against a guy who told that in his blog. Well, he told that in incredibly stupid and offensive way (something in the lines of ""fuck off crazy wankers your deep-shit god does not exist since if he did he won't create a stupid shit like you in the first place""), but *law-suite*, Carl! for saying something in the blog!

I only got to see all of this USA sjw crap like half-a-year a go, since mostly I have some serious stuff to do instead of mindlessly browsing internet. 
But the amount of cheep crazyness they do in there is just extreme. Its FUBAR thing, society should ignore them &amp; move on. 

I've used to call myself a liberal back in the day, but it seems that this political cliche has been made amazingly dirty, insane and stupid. In Ru, our conservatives call peeps ""Liberashka"", that means like ""liberalish faggot bitch"" or something in the lines.

645,"Take InfiTech2 modpack. That would delay all of your common goals by quite a giant amount of time. This guys even have refined Thaumcraft to be actually challenging and rewarding, and to keep up with the technical mods progression.

Example for your current goal: to get ME system up and running, you don't only need quartz, but you need some serious infratructure of EV level (that means, at least two or three weeks of intence gameplay). You don't throw seeds into water to get pure crystals, you use chemical reactor with water for that, and this recipes for reactor needs 1920 eu/t to run. That is a bitch to get (and definetly an end-game goal). 

Also, one feature I really love about GT and InfiTech is that if you fail to provide power, you're punished for that. For example, if a recipe needs 32 eu/t but you only can do 20 eu/t, and your battery buffer runs out of energy while smelting - well.. you've lost a chunk of energy and re-started the proccess. etc etc.

 I never played a pack where the main energy system is RF, (well actually when I've ever used RF mods I've just hooked them up to ic2 cables via forestry or GT cables..) so I don't have enough experience with BR, however from what I understand they provide more power, and require less micromanagement.",2016-04-23 19:55:39+00:00,d2el6t3,1.0,t3_4g4z6i,331.0,feedthebeast

The 2 things that are considered `hardcore` by players are microcrafting (for some stuff, you need screws, bolts, plates &amp; rings, just as IRL you would) and waittimes. However, I don't see a problem in either of those, since microcrafting is cool, and waiting bit is a part of gameplay - I don't usually sit near my machines waiting for them to process ore I've put into them; I adventure instead, or build needed stuff, or do farming, or whatever.

Also protip, with IT2, you'll probably have a LOT of activities going on simultaneously, also you'll need to do some primitive math once in a while (since in the early game, most of your ores would be in ore state unless you need them, and you need to count how much of this&amp;that you'll need for your next multiblock).

728,"Its very different. Instead of having small patches of ores, you'll have a big 3x3 chunks veins. But you will have to search for them. There is in-game book called ""ore gen something"" not sure of the name that has information on any ores - which dimensions gens them, which altitude, etc. Veins consist usually of 2-3 different ores (e.g. brown limonite + malachite + yellow limonite + branded iron = 1 vein; tetrahedrite + stibnite = other vein; lithium + tungsten = one more other vein, etc etc). For some stuff, you'll need things that you can only get via transmutations (thaumcraft transmutation system covers every single metal in pack) or via getting to some tech &amp; getting byproducts. For example, sodium batteries (the ""middle tier"" that stores not-so-much but not-so-small amount of energy each)  - they will require you to get chem. element Na, which you can only get by spinning salt in centrifuge. (NaCl -&gt; chloride + natrium). There are quite a lot of pathes which ores can take in the modpack, e.g. same ore after maceration can be put through 2-3 different variants of processing, getting you various amounts of products and various byproducts. 

Also, processing is chemically-correct. Like, tetrahedrite ore, with (Cu,Fe)12Sb4S13 formula IRL, can be processed to copper, iron, stibnite and sulfur, depending on your tech level.
Also, there are a LOT of ores. Like tons of them. And every ore has its use. 


Technical progression there would be quite different from what you're used to, too. You don't just dig for a while and then have infinite power and resources; you have to actually progress through various stages of your tech tree to achieve anything, and that might take some time. 

Also, everything is tied more or less to technical progression. Thaumcraft recipes got overhauled quite a lot, and now most advanced ones would require the tech-y stuffs to be created. Like, golems requiring robotic arms and chipsets.

Think of it as of IE done the other way around - instead of continious tech tree, taking you from mod to mod, you have a continious tech tree which has a big trunk called ""gregtech"", and you can start any other mod only after you've achieved something in gregtech. For example, to get forestry farms going, you'll need to progress to LV age of gregtech (32 eu/t) at minimum. The main ""motto"" for GT and this pack in particular is that the further you get&amp;the more advanced technology you have - the less materials and more power you'll need.

&gt;Q: What is the difference between the source code found in the OpenJDK repository, and the code you use to build the Oracle JDK?

&gt;A: It is very close - our build process for Oracle JDK releases builds on OpenJDK 7 by adding just a couple of pieces, like the deployment code, which includes Oracle's implementation of the Java Plugin and Java WebStart, as well as some closed source third party components like a graphics rasterizer, some open source third party components, like Rhino, and a few bits and pieces here and there, like additional documentation or third party fonts. Moving forward, our intent is to open source all pieces of the Oracle JDK except those that we consider commercial features such as JRockit Mission Control (not yet available in Oracle JDK), and replace encumbered third party components with open source alternatives to achieve closer parity between the code bases.

*This kind of licenses don't actually enforce you to give your stuff for free (and GPL does not, as well: you just have to give the code to your user, and give him equal rights as you have, including redistribution; which may or may not include redistribution of bundled content); and one can earn his (or hers) penny without having to be an asshat clown.

Also, content. (which would've been good to have CC licenses, but that I care about only slightly).

this money part of this related more to /real world/ programming then game mods creating, yeah, and this brings even more of the reason to the initial point.

With TiCo, I never've seen the need to automate it, since you make 1 tool, and you're set. Everything else can be handled by other mods. Also, since GT came into discussion, other thing I don't like in most mods (TE - /vanilla/ IC2 - EIO - MFR - Mekanism) is that you can have one-block-to-make-it-all. GT brings in machine specialities. You want to get some rubies? Throw in a Sifter, or an Implosion Compressor, or an Autoclave. You want to get some Chrome from said Ruby? Throw in Electrolyzer to separate Chrome from Aluminum from Ruby Dust. That is fun to automate in my opinion (not even pretending to be objective here, just describing what I like), and that actually makes me feel some emotions while playing.

984,"Most such items (conveyor belts, pumps, robotic arms, etc etc) can act as ""covers"". So when you have a pump in your hand, you may see this:
http://imgur.com/q9PV2xI
you may rightclick with your pump on the block (machine) or pipe to install it.
Beware: covers stay on pipes when pipes are broken, so don't panic. To remove any kind of cover you must use crowbar.
There are 8 areas, middle is the side of the block you're looking at, corners are opposite sides, 4 long parts are corresponding sides of the block. 
To use pump, you must first install the pump, second right click it with a screwdriver (click on the ""side"" of the block where pump is works, so you don't actually need to look at the pump) to set it into ""import"" mode.
First mode is export, so it exports from the block its assigned to into neighboring block, next is import, others are different combinations of import/export with some control.
Also, infitech thread on ftb is just epicly good, and author himself, with Blood Asp, are hanging around there, answering the questions, posting stuff, etc etc. Have good luck with your factory!
