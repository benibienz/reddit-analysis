* California: population 38 million, voted ~9 million

* New Mexico: population 2 million, voted ~1 million
* Minnesota: population 5 million, voted ~2.5 million
* New York state: population 20 million, voted ~5 million

Now, back in my birth country (Russia) we have a thing called ""minimum turnout"". It means, that if less then 50% of voters actually turn to cast their vote, voting proccess is nullified and restarted. Even judging by ^ that, there is only 1 state with &gt;50% voter turnout. And several states with &lt;30% turnout!

Google says there are 318.9 mil of USA citizens in USA. only 120 mil voted in this election, judging by nytimes election page (and google election page, too).
Blue states have everything from 25 to 55% turnout. 

I wonder why, may be that is because HRC is a shit candidate? 

Or may be because Trump supporters thought that they would loose in Cali anyways? 

Guess both are true. I also think that if Trump supporters would've actually moved their asses in Cali, Cali would've turned Red. Nevada, too, since in Nevada only Las Vegas has moved the state towards Clinton. I mean, every other place has 50 point difference in favor of Trump, and then Las Vegas blows it with 10 points difference.

Question:

Let's assume for the sake of question terrible circumstances that lead to the win of mrs Crooked. The dire consequences of this can be heard from a lot of sources on YT, in Brietbart, etc.

How far do US Presidents power stretches? E.g., multiple sources say she wants to wage war on Russia. (in fact, this is an outcome that I fear the most). Will she be able single-handedly say ""Let's shoot some bad guys"" and start the action, or this would require approval from senate? (for the sake of question, assuming that senate is not braindead and can actually stand up against will of the president). Are there any precedents in semi-modern US history, in which senate has actually forced down the proposition of any foreign policy, made by Presidents? 


this might seem obvious to USA residents, however I do not understand USA politics that much, which lead to the need of this question.

I'm a big fan of chaos, and thus I'm playing Mayhem. At the same time, I am kinda new to the X3 (I've played some 600ish hours but that was mostly 3-4 years ago). So, questions:

1) any races that have unique software not obtainable via the HQ/Sanctuary?
2) any races that have unique wares that I can not produce?
3) any point to have any allies in game?

Currently, my first sector (USO) is self-sustained on food, and has a bit of overproduction of energy. I have increased the station limit to 16, so I have ore, chips, computer components, silicon &amp; HEPT production going, too. 

From what I see there is no access to System Override SW and Scrambler in sanctuary, but I have 5 copies of SOS on my (stationary) ships, and Scrambler is not really that important (I do not rely on trade for anything at the moment). Plutarch mining system is also impossible to create, but I have a mammoth with Plutarch system, too (may be I should make a backup Mammoth just in case). Did I miss anything in here?

Not sure if I want to take over Argon sector next to me or if I want to claim other Unknown non-claimed sectors.

God knows why they think that control over people who's views are different from them would not become the targets of such government control (useful idiots! ideal term for that.)
I've had enough of (pseudo-conservative) govrnment control in Russia, and I do not want to get back to `liberal` version of that shit.

Basically, someone can claim that you saying ""god doesn't exist"" was offensive to him - and that is criminal charge, with lawsuit and such. This is kinda- enforced by ""masses"", which in truth are like .1% of the pop which are paid for their protests against `offensive atheists`, and cry the loudest)

Have some q's:

1) Was the last presidential race as intense as this one?

2) I see on YT that every candidate is saying same speech almost every other rally. Why is that? That seems a bit strange to me.

This usage referred to the Communist party line, which provided for ""correct"" positions on many political matters. According to American educator Herbert Kohl, writing about debates in New York in the late 1940s and early 1950s,

The term ""politically correct"" was used disparagingly, to refer to someone whose loyalty to the CP line overrode compassion, and led to bad politics. It was used by Socialists against Communists, and was meant to separate out Socialists who believed in egalitarian moral ideas from dogmatic Communists who would advocate and defend party positions regardless of their moral substance.

After reading a bit about different drama Minecraft situations, I see that the worst thing that modders keep bugging other people with, is bugreports. 

""He used my mod with this it crashed and they keep me bugging with bug reports blah blah yada yada blah blah blah"". 

I don't get it. 2 main Points why I don't get it:

1) Bugreports are cool. They help you make software great. (This is actually main point)

2) Why people report bugs to *mod author* instead of reporting them to *modpack author*?

This just makes SO much sense to me. Since its modpack author who is responsible for putting those specific versions of those specific mods together in a pack, and not keeping them updated, andor putting them together in incompatible ways, and *modpack author* should be responsible for figuring out if the bug is in his modpack only, or is in cross-mod integration, or is in this specific mod.
