I have a binge eating problem late at night. I even wake up to eating voraciously, the hunger I feel is overwhelming.  

Yesterday after eating dinner (which is late in my culture, around 9-10 pm), which consisted primarily on a tomato-carrot salad, some beans and some chicken, I went sleeping. I woke up at 2 am and went after five cookies with milk. This guilty binge of eating was carried fast, in a thrill, knowing fully how bad this behaviour was. Rice crackers coudn't help.

I woke up weighting my absolute highest wheight ever measured, I've reached 80kg. I can't belive how bad this year was even though I did try dieting. Even though I've run a lot lately about 100km in october, this hasn't helped on losing weight and people are starting to notice it.

I just did my first cDNA synthesis using total RNA extracted from tissues. I'm using 500ng total RNA/reaction using Easyscript treating the sample with DNaseI before Retrotranscription. 

I'm using GAPDH from mice for testing results. My primers should produce a 111bp band on the cDNA and a large 1945bp band from the gene if genomic DNA remained (even though I'm using dnase). The thing is, my negative controls (withouth easyscript) are producing the 111bp band which I would expect only from the  cDNA. I'm doing a master mix and the Negative Template Control turns negative

I'm completely new to qPCR. I need to quantify the expresion of a gene in a specific tissue, so I would proceed making mRNA extraction with trizol and make cDNA with reverse transcriptase.

So, I've made a pair of primers in accordance with the following tutorial:
http://bitesizebio.com/10041/a-step-by-step-guide-to-designing-qpcr-primers/

But I'm worried about nonspecific amplification. I just read that after the real time PCR is done, it will do a melting analysis and that would tell me about alternative amplifications (which would ruin the objective of the qPCR).

One of my primers spanning the junction between exons has a large homology with other genes in the same gene family, (like 10bp with only one different base at the middle). The reverse primers just has random 7bp annealing with other parts of those genes, which I think it's unavoidable.

La deficiente pavimentación y sólo en las calles céntricas.
