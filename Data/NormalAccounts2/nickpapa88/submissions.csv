I love the idea of drafting a team like draft champions and playing to win. But the 3 innings games are horrid. There is such a tiny margin for error that the game mode seems more random than skill based. Why not just let us play 9 inning games and lower the win milestones for rewards by a few? 3 inning games are trash.

I also don't like the two loss rule... Baseball has THREE strikes so why would two losses/strikes end your run? Seems like a dumb way to get people to tank stubs. Maybe it works but why is that good for the community? There has to be a better way. 

Lastly, why 1500 stubs?! The standard packs are HORRIFIC. I'd rather play for 500 and not get a silly pack as a reward. The last ten packs I've opened from BR have net nothing more than average bronze/silver junk. Give me that 10k back!!! I don't care about the random 1% chance to get something good, I'd rather EARN a reward thru BR. 

Ultimately, the game mode is so unapproachable and not enjoyable that it takes away the best part of DD for me. Please fix this. Make it cheaper, make it 9 innings, and dear god give us more then two losses and done.
