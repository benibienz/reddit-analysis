Also teaching students LibreOffice does not prepare students for a world dominated by MS Office and Google Docs. This product is clearly meant for a specific purpose. If teachers or schools want to spend way more on a bunch of Raspberry Pis for every student and waste class time troubleshooting and setting everything up then fine.

62,"There is a strong correlation between education and economic mobility, this is why there are affirmative action programs in universities. 

There is a strong correlation between nutrition and school performance, this is why there are free lunch and food stamp programs. 

Generally people with strong and diverse social networks have better vocational success, this is why there are programs to help with job training, resume building, and networking skills.

Children from families who need to choose between paying rent and school supplies, food, winter clothes, etc. generally have more issues in school, this is why rent assistance is a thing.

People are constantly working on this problem and continually trying new things. If you have some ideas on what would work then connect with a non-profit or start your own.

When there is trouble in a neighborhood like there was in Sherman Park it highlights that more work needs to be done. 

&gt;'Help' should result in better outcomes right?

Generally organizations try to find what works long term and do that. It can be very complicated because the conditions are constantly changing so strategy needs to change yet still be effective.

Now HUD has very little power to change the state of segregation in current day America. It was only 50 years ago that the federal government was actively segregating neighborhoods. When Nixon put a stop to Romney's plan he acknowledged this would mean more intense segregation, but he did it anyway.

I didn't say that, nor do I believe it. I am just highlighting a very unfortunate part of the problem.

&gt; But BLM has the solution:commit more senseless violence against people of the race you irrationally hate, in order to draw attention to how unfairly the world treats racist, violent thugs!

I am not trying to defend BLM. Also I don't think there is an official BLM chapter in Milwaukee. I don't believe the events which transpired in Milwaukee were officially sponsored or condoned by BLM.

86,"My main issue with many of these abstract discussions is how removed from reality they become. 

&gt; exploitation is realized as appropriation of value created by any wage labour for capitalist

This is such a confusing sentence for me. I think I understand the intent however it is such a gross over-simplification it looses nearly all connection to reality. 

As an example let's say there is a business:

* Goods production
 * Low education workers (roughly 100)
 * Low education managers (roughly 15)
 * Educated Managers
* Goods design
 * Inexperienced designers
 * Experienced designers
 * Design managers
* Finance
 * Inexperienced buyers
 * Experienced buyers
 * Inexperienced Sales
 * Experienced Sales
 * Accounting
 * Sales Manager
 * Buyer manager
* Directors
 * Director of production
 * Director of design
 * Director of finance 
* Vice President
* President/Founder
* Board
 * 5 Board members
 * Chairman of the board 
 * Shareholders

In this example who is the ""Capitalist""? 

Also generally as salary for an individual increases, generally their responsibility and their dependence on the company's success also increases. In this company many people are benefiting from many other people. The low education workers are benefiting from good design giving them easy work with good pay. The designers are benefiting from good money management giving them freedom and good pay. Finally the shareholders are all benefiting from people doing good work.

92,"&gt; OK you don't know what capitalism is.

Maybe you are right... let me [Google the definition](https://www.google.com/#q=define+capitalism): 

**Cap·i·tal·ismˈkapədlˌizəm/: noun:** *an economic and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit, rather than by the state.*

So you made up a definition of the word to fit your world view. However that is not enough to redefine the word. When The majority of people read/hear/use the word capitalism they are not using your definition. 

There are many examples in the Bible of economic systems where the trade and industry were controlled by private owners for profit rather than by the state. 

&gt; Interest is the cost of money.

Maybe you are right... let me [Google the definition](https://www.google.com/#safe=off&amp;q=define+intrest):

**in·ter·est ˈint(ə)rəst/ noun:** *2. money paid regularly at a particular rate for the use of money lent, or for delaying the repayment of a debt.*

Shoot. I guess you made up another definition of a common word. 

&gt; Such a bank would be like a grocer who gives away his produce for free. ie nonexistent.

Or such a bank would simply have a flat fee for taking out a loan. The difference being a flat fee is not a rate. Such bank loans do exist. http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/05/13/477956675/episode-701-a-bank-without-interest

* Mac has terrible window management tools
* Mac has lots of random gaps and different features like hot corners making layout difficult
* Full screen on a Mac is strange and hides menu bars 
* Windows has Aero snap 
* Windows can easily maximize a window without obscuring the taskbar
* A good work flow on a Mac is to manually lay out your windows before getting to work
  * This means once a layout is set it Mac users don't want to move the windows around so they just go do a different desktop
* Using Windows users can just quickly snap programs to one side or the other so there is no reason to preserve windows layouts with different desktops.

Native apps tend to perform better, be more feature rich, less sensitive to network connectivity, and take better advantage of hardware features (play pause buttons, hardware decoding, extra sensors, etc.)

If anything all this shows that Google does not invest long term into their products, but instead invests in new products or technology. This is not inherently a problem, but for people who rely heavily upon Google's products it could become a problem.

Personally I used to be invested in Google products, but they rarely improved and were frequently killed in favor of a different product. This made me nervous about investing time or resources it products which could be gone in a year. 

On the other hand Microsoft epitomizes the other side of the investment and support coin. Because Microsoft supports so many products for such a long time they spread their resources thin and are frequently prevented from innovating or taking risks because their customers are so static and change resistant. 

Neither company is clearly better, just different. Microsoft suits me for some things, Apple other things, and Google other things as well.  ",2016-01-28 22:23:00+00:00,czfo8cf,9,t1_czfnhfs,1082,windowsphone

226,"**Let's look at productivity:**

Microsoft 

* Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, OneDrive, Outlook
* Native apps - Windows, Universal Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Chrome, Amazon App store, Web

Apple 

* Pages, Numbers, Keynote, Notes, iCloud, Mail
* Native apps - Mac, iOS, Web

Google

* Docs, Sheets, Presentation, Slides, Drive, Gmail
* Native Apps - Windows (Drive only), Android, iOS 


Now which company has a financial interest in productivity, Microsoft. So, obviously they would have the best support. If Google really cared about their customers they would build native apps on Windows to give them a good experience.


**Let's look at music:**

Microsoft Groove

* Native Apps - Universal Windows, iOS, Android, Web

Apple Music, via iTunes

* Native Apps - Windows, Mac, iOS, Android

Google Music

* Native Apps - Android, iOS, Web

Now here Apple has the vested interest, and has the slight lead. So if Microsoft doesn't care about Music why would they build apps for Android and iOS? Because they understand people are diverse purchasers and just because you use an iPhone doesn't mean you don't use Microsoft services. Google knows Windows has the vast majority of the desktop marketshare, but doesn't build a native Windows app, why not? If you think ""Web is enough"" is the answer look at Spotify, Pandora, and iTunes.

I'm not trying to say Microsoft is this altruistic company, but they do tend to support their customers even when they are in different ecosystems. Other examples Xbox, Yammer, Skype, Skype for Business apps for iOS and Android.

I would love to see a YouTube app for Windows, or a Gmail app to compete with the Outlook Mail app. But, alas Google is silent on the topic, which is a bummer for competition and for their shared customers. ",2016-01-28 21:35:49+00:00,czfm8le,7,t1_czfi73j,5534,windowsphone

Google on the other hand is less of an obvious case because so many of their products are cloud based, but they know by avoiding Windows Phone they will have a negative affect on it, this is a fine business strategy.

In which case I would say there are some awesome free IDEs for Windows which are good stepping stones into the real world of Visual Studio, but if you plan to do web/server/iOS/Android dev then Unix (Mac) would be better.",2015-08-26 20:39:13+00:00,cugosny,3,t1_cugofum,504,windows

If you use Windows you can do anything. 

If you get an Apple laptop you are limited to Design, Video editing, and Unix based coding. 

Windows 10 is so awesome and when I use my wife's MBP it is so painful. Bad keyboard shortcuts, strange UI which looks to be built for touch... but there are no touch Apple laptops, zero customization options, walled garden of device compatibility. 

Ultimately the best device is the one which you prefer working on, they are so similar when doing most things. Know all the platforms and you'll be fine.",2015-08-26 18:46:08+00:00,cugk3m5,1,t3_3igvth,16569,windows

290,Thanks for the reply. It is always interesting to see how people interact differently with technology.

297,The majority of MS revenue comes from enterprise. Also they will sell a ton of Win10 licenses when they come on new PCs. MS isn't loosing a sale by giving the update to Win7 and Win8 users they are just getting everyone on the same playing field. Very few people will ever upgrade and almost none when it isn't free.

However, the current advantage afforded by Microsoft is this, choice. With a Surface for example you can run full powered Photoshop or Premiere Pro. But if apps are more your style use apps. Windows tablets are full powered computers meaning they can use nearly all devices via USB. This makes using Windows devices awesome with few compromises.
