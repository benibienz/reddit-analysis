That being said, I was excited to see what Microsoft unveiled at Build 2016 and I was not impressed. It really seemed like there were almost no major announcements targeting what I understand as major criticisms of Windows 10. Hopefully someone can change my mind.

Great Announcements

* Action Center in the cloud
* Windows Ink
* Xamarin 
* Bash in Windows

Announcements which were way overdue 

* Chaseable live tiles
* Live tiles kept in sync
* Project Centennial
* Xbox dev kit

Lackluster announcements

* Start menu layout tweaks
* Action Center tweaks
*  Apps on Xbox
 
Elephant in the Ecosystem (ignored issues)

* Skype sucking
* Unified communications
* the Windows Store sucking
* When will we get the apps we've been promised?
  * Facebook (FB, FB Messenger, Insta)
  * Viber
  * OneDrive
  * Adobe Photoshop Elements
  * Adobe Premier Elements 
* Where the hell was Windows 10 Mobile?

Remaining questions

* Are there new meaningful APIs?
* is Google still avoiding Windows?
* Is the Surface 4 going to be a thing?

I still find it hard to believe that Microsoft has not delivered a slightly compelling experience between the two. Also, I use Windows 10 on a desktop and a laptop; there is little to no advantage to having more than one device running Windows 10. In fact, having more than one device running Windows 10 is just more annoying because I get the same notification 3 times. 



In the wake of all the ""Windows Phone is dead"" doom and gloom of last week, I thought it would be interesting to see what Windows 10 Mobile / Windows Phone users thought could make Windows 10 Mobile more interesting to consumers.



1. Let me SMS/MMS from my Windows 10 PC



2. Sync the Action Center between Windows 10 devices



3. Complete the ""Project My Screen"" app



The first point is fairly straightforward but overall I think that a cohesive messaging strategy is missing from the Microsoft ecosystem, even though Microsoft owns Skype! Also, the Windows 10 Messaging app needs to sync notifications better and update the Live Tile unread count if the messages have been read on a different device.



The action center has become a source of pain instead of joy for me. I'll open my laptop and all the notifications I missed while it was sleeping pop up over and over. This creates a problem because frequently when I get notifications I don't trust that they are relevant or useful to me and I usually ignore them. If I could right-click a notification and add it to a Wunderlist as a To-Do‚Ä¶ that would be way more helpful to me.



Microsoft created this awesome program for Windows called Project My Screen app. Essentially you could plug your Windows Phone into your PC and view the phone screen on the computer. However only in Windows 8 and Windows 10 you use your mouse to interact with the phone. I would love to see Microsoft rollout an update to the Project My Screen app which could take keyboard input, right click, and scroll support. This would enable me to use my apps and personal information on any Windows 7,8, or 10 PC without actually installing the apps or copying any data.



Pushing the idea further, the Project My Screen app when used with Continuum capable phones could run Universal Apps on the desktop. This would incentivize people who use Windows at work to get Windows 10 Mobile phones. Also this would make phones extremely powerful because they could use existing Windows computers to extend the capabilities of the phone. Use the conference room PC to project a presentation which is on your phone. This would be a clear advantage over iOS and Android and it would piggyback upon the huge market share Windows has in businesses without requiring any additional hardware investments.



Those are my ideas, but what top 3 things do you think Microsoft should focus on to attract their existing customers to Windows 10 Mobile?

I want to see Microsoft compete with Apple and Google in the mobile space, but their strategy currently is change nothing, invest nothing, and risk nothing.

Windows 10 Mobile features:

 * Unified communication? - nope
 * Action Center Sync Across devices - nope
 * Pass app sessions between Windows 10 devices - nope
 * Live tiles - frequently out of date or broken, still static
 * Pen input - nope
 * Run Android apps - nope

I think Microsoft is playing it too safe with Windows 10 Mobile. They know they cannot catch up to iOS or Android by being a copycat, so they should take risks and do weird stuff and try and move the mobile space.

Hopefully people don't read this as being negative. I think Windows 10 Mobile is fine, but just not interesting. I wonder if there is anything the Windows 10 Mobile community can do to push Microsoft to risk more and try new things instead of playing mobile so safe. What do you think?

Then when I am grocery shopping the email pops up and I get access to the sales.

Another simple example involves notifications. I should be able to right click (or long press) notifications and ask to be reminded about them. Again you could choose the typical reminder options (time, location, person) then not forget about it. 

Similar to reminders with notifications. We should be able to right click (or long press) notifications and get the ability to add the item to a reading list, or a to-do list.

If Microsoft added these integrations I would use Cortana way more on the desktop and it would help build the case for why universal apps are useful.
