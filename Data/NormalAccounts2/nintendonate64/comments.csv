184,Won't happen. Nintendo is going to show Pokemon stuff Zelda NX and like a few small other things which I doubt anyone is really going to care for because it's not a blockbuster name. Sadly as well if we get another animal crossing it will probably be 3ds again without anything over the top added to it when the series has so much potential. Nintendo tends to screw their own best sellers over by putting them on mobile and limiting what they can do. ,2016-06-09 01:13:40+00:00,d41pnaj,1.0,t3_4n77ba,16719.0,AnimalCrossing

188,"I will admit Beltran is doing great, if we didn't have a rod next year I'd resign him as a DH for next season and a veteran in the dugout to be that role model. Alex does a great job of that already and I wouldn't risk re signing more players than could be hit or miss. Chapman could be traded and then the organization could try to outbid for him in the off season if they wanted to. Nova can go honestly too inconsistent. Pineda I don't even think is worth holding at this point. Gardy is worth keeping in my mind because of last season how him and Ellsbury always got on base at the front of the line up. If there's problems with that move Castro into the spot. With Tex gone next year too we won't have to worry about his awful numbers, bird can play that role full time and maybe Ref be the backup for first.

So normally I just keep walking a little slower and cautiously the usual, but this eventful fucking friday for getting my ass out of bed and going to school being the responsible kid, i slip, fell down hard to the ground and broke a bone in my ankle. I proceeded to walk to school thinking i just bruised it. It took us 2 weeks to find out that I had broken it.

826,"most decks that are kind of a part of the entire meta right now are going to get slammed by everything post rotation. Although I'm seeing a rise in interest for Trevenant / Gengar builds. The only thing is the deck will lose virbank and float stone 2 sort of ""essential"" pieces of the puzzle. But it is fairly cheap to build.
