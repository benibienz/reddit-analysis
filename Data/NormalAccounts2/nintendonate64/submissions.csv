Aside from doing the main story of the quest the game offers with massive amounts of free experience there are a few places you can go to grind out some levels in between and rake in a lot of items. 

Level 5-20
Early in the game you should be at a strong enough level to take on Level 6 Piedra Level 7 Pomumm (the spider plants) and level 8 Woolys which can be located in the Wanderer's Camp. Getting into a party and killing all 3 of these as fast as they spawn (note the more people in a party the more will spawn) will help you grind out some levels and share a lot of dropped items just to begin your game. You can either sell these items or bank them for future item creation at the blacksmith, your call. I would recommend this until about level 20 or somewhere you find yourself confident enough to move onto the next level. Just because you are level 20 doesn't always mean you can beat level 20 enemies easily keep that in mind. The point of this is to grind out levels as fast as possible with the most exp gain.

Level 15/20-25
Raffy level 9 in ruined temple town. These things are not very aggressive at all and don't take a lot to defeat, they spawn quickly and you can almost just button mash in a party and one will always be there to fight. Once again kind of use your judgement based on how quickly you can defeat them moving on to the next level. If you want to there are also some level 11 Beak just around the corner but keep in mind they do not spawn as much or as often. 

Level 30-40
Goblins
the goblins inside the ruined temple area 1 are probably your best first REAL exp grinding. Keep in mind these pesky buggers can be aggressive and eat up a lot of your health but they do drop a lot of items in return that you can sell off. 

level 35+
Lavarca lv 21
This is something i still do on a daily basis, it brings in a good amount of spina and its solid experience. Just outside of Rakau Plains there's a spawn point for these big blue furry creatures. Now without a party these guys can be a little slower but with a party I've seen lavarca spawn extremely frequent. Just watch out for their secondary attack that will knock you off your feet if you can't kill in within a few blows. This can easily be avoided by just running away from it's target red circle. 

Now that is just some of my method and killing places. There are also boss grinding fights although the problems you can experience there are:
Party members disbanding or leaders quitting, only one member pulls the weight and fights take up to 2-3 minutes to get maybe 500xp or so. etc. It's not the fastest most efficient way but it does get experience don't get me wrong. Just be at the right level and get the right party members on board. 

Now for level 45- onward I'm still trying to figure out myself where the perfect place is. I'm level 50 currently and still exploring etc. Feel free to leave a comment below on where you've trained and found it to be of assistance. If you liked my short guide let me know and I'll look into writing more.
