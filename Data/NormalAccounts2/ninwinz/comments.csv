Certainly a game that I would really enjoy. It's been out for a few years, and I've heard so many good things about it.

623,"1)Tell us a little about yourself.  
I'm currently a sophomore majoring in Computer Science at college. I love playing and collecting video games, especially Nintendo games. I grew up playing on my older sister's NES, and now I own nearly all of the American Nintendo consoles (not the Virtual Boy though).  

2)What timezone are you in?  
Right now, I'm in the Central timezone. When college starts (less than a month), I'll be in the Pacific timezone.  

3)Why are you interested in the sub? What do you like about it?  

I'm interested in this sub because I love the 3DS and family. I have a 2DS, a 3DS, a Mario &amp; Luigi Dream Team 3DS XL, and a Majora's Mask New 3DS XL. I like the friendly and helpful community on /r/3DS.  

4)How much experience do you have (if any) moderating?  
I have never moderated any subs.  

5)How much time do you spend on reddit? What is your timezone and what times are you most active on reddit?  

I spend varying amounts of time on Reddit, but I often check it throughout the day and have it readily available. During college, I'm most active between 7am and 9am, then after 5pm to 12 Pacific time.  

6)Any ideas on how this sub could improve, or what you'd like to see from this sub in the future?  

I think it would be cool for this sub to occasionally have friendly competitions or events, such as a Mario Kart tournament or something similar.   

7)What's your favorite 3DS game?  
That's a hard one. If including remakes, I think my favorite would be Ocarina of Time 3D. Otherwise, I think it'd have to be Mario &amp; Luigi Dream Team.  

8)(Optional) Do you have any experience with CSS, designing websites or other subreddits?  
I've used a small amount of CSS and took a Web Page Design class in high school.  

9)Provide links to a few of your past comments on /r/3DS that showcase your contributions to this community.  
I've actually been more of a lurker than contributor so far..   

10)What's your schedule like? School? Work? What hours are you usually active?  
When college starts again, I'll probably be moderately busy with classes and work from 9am to 5pm Pacific. During that time frame, I do check Reddit when I get a chance. Any other time when I'm awake, I usually have Reddit open in a side tab.  

11)(Optional) Any other questions/comments?  
Thanks for the consideration!
