Just making a second check of my reservation today, I realized that it said the 26th (one week later) instead of the 19th. I spent about an hour trying to figure out my options to fix this. I was flying out of a small airport, so all flights to my destination were sold out. The same thing goes for all surrounding airports. Finally, I called customer service and was able to get a flight leaving the 20th, a day after originally planned, but I guess it will have to work. It ended up costing me practically twice as much because my ticket was nonrefundable.

TL;DR: I reserved a flight for a week later than planned. It was a costly mistake (literally).",tifu,TIFU by reserving a flight for the wrong date,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3limh3/tifu_by_reserving_a_flight_for_the_wrong_date/
