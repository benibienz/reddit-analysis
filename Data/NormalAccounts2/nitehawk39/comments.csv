Hogwarts doesn't have rolling admissions, so it would seem odd to kind of pass and go through Hogwarts seemingly without much need for interaction. Also scrolls have the potential to be monetized in a way that could imbalance the game. It could work out well if business side economics were not the focal point, but even then it is difficult to quantify a spell or wizard's capability by how many buffs they can put on their wand.",2016-10-23 21:49:11+00:00,d94rp3o,1,t3_58yqae,27094,harrypotter

6,"Current engineer here! Campus life is very unique because for a school of this size, you get to know people if you are looking to. It feels smaller to me since I always run into familiar faces but can also hide if needed. Engineering varies by discipline, but many companies are partners with Umass and will hire x number of grads and undergrads to positions. We had about 100 companies come last week for an engineering and Comp Sci career fair so there are plenty of opportunities. While I haven't been hired to any of those jobs, postings are very frequent and we have a pretty good career department. As for formula SAE, we definitely had teams in the past (their trophies are displayed in one of the Engineering buildings) but I'm not sure if they are a club per se or just student driven. Our facilities are not brand new looking but are very well equipped, especially if you are interested in research.

While I personally love my experience as an Engineer, I do also want to emphasize that the decision is up to you. Often your choice of schools changes when letters are released. Advice from strangers is always useful but at the end of the day, it's your college experience. Good luck on your Senior year, college application, and maybe I'll see you around the Engineering quad next fall!",2016-10-05 20:10:46+00:00,d8fhka0,1,t3_560ykz,6356,umass

I think that adding payment removes the love and dedication to the game. You should do it because you love the game, money coming second.

For example, a beginner and an expert can try to make a mechanical heart (last month's contest). while both produce a scene that they are satisfied with, the expert has more knowledge to polish said scene.
