256,"Here read it for yourself:

The case, Republican National Committee vs. Democratic National Committee, dealt with a consent decree issued in 1982 that prevents the RNC from engaging in some voter fraud prevention efforts without prior court consent. It specifically said the RNC could not engage in ballot security efforts (later defined in 1987 as “ballot integrity, ballot security or other efforts to prevent or remedy vote fraud,” according to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit opinion), especially in areas where racial or ethnic makeup could be considered a reason for the activities.

A response to claims of voter intimidation in minority areas in the 1970s and early 1980s, the decree allowed the RNC to continue “normal poll watching” operations while barring activities that could be aimed at voter suppression, though the RNC complained to the courts that the distinction was unclear and difficult to follow. The decree effectively put the national party on the sidelines as concern about voter fraud became more and more pronounced in GOP ranks in recent years and as states passed a series of voter-identification measures.

In deciding the case, which stems from a 2008 lawsuit brought by the DNC, the district court clarified ballot security efforts as “any program aimed at combating voter fraud by preventing potential voters from registering to vote or casting a ballot,” and upheld the consent decree while adding a Dec. 1, 2017, expiration date.

257,"Yes about this guy:

The personal ties between Donald Trump and Jeff Zucker, the chief executive of CNN, extend beyond the reality TV hit they created together into a far more personal realm: the expensive Manhattan private school where they have both sent children, and where Zucker’s wife was until recently a member of the board.

Trump’s foundation has contributed more than $150,000 over the past three years to the Columbia Grammar and Preparatory School, a nonprofit school on Manhattan’s Upper West Side also known as Columbia Prep. Caryn Zucker is listed as a board member for the school in tax documents covering July 2012 through June 2014.

Zucker has drawn criticism inside and outside of CNN for the cable channel’s coverage of Trump, including charges that CNN has turned its platform over to a demagogue and hasn’t been sufficiently skeptical of Trump’s routine campaign falsehoods. Zucker has brushed off these charges, saying that it’s only natural for a political frontrunner to receive outsize attention. Neither party has referred publicly to this family connection.

In February 2015, five months before Trump announced his candidacy, he and his wife, Melania, posed for a photograph with Caryn at the Upper West Side school’s annual benefit. In a gallery that was initially posted on the photographer’s website, Caryn Zucker was the only person Trump was pictured with other than Melania. (After an inquiry to Columbia Prep from BuzzFeed News, the photograph was removed from the photographer’s website.) Trump’s foundation donated $50,000 to the school that same day.

That is not an honest way to describe

While in the Senate, Hillary Clinton introduced the Count Every Vote Act of 2005 to combat a “history of intimidation.” Fighting against voter ID laws

Clinton co-sponsored a bill reinforcing anti-discrimination and equal-pay requirements; specifically, to restore, reaffirm, and reconcile legal rights and remedies under civil rights statutes. The bill amended the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to establish discrimination based on disparate impact; and rights of action and recovery for unlawful discrimination. It also authorized civil actions in federal court for discrimination based on disability, and repealed provisions limiting the amount of compensatory and punitive damages that may be awarded in cases of intentional discrimination in employment. Finally, it revised provisions governing discrimination in the payment of wages, including equal pay requirements.

You are operating under the assumption that people should be allowed to use the power of their political office to force their ideological views on the people rather than elected officials serving the will of the people.

See one of the advantages of being older is I know what society was like back when Hillary was opposed to gay marriage.   It was a situation where society would never vote for a person who advocated what at the time was a wildly radical position.    The irony is the Clintons helped to foster the forward progress that resulted in the eventual granting of marriage equity (at least as long as the Trump and the GOP is kept out of power).

President Bill Clinton signed don't ask/don't tell which was a progressive move that allowed gays to serve in the military even though they couldn't be open about their sexuality.  Prior to that, a commanding officer could demand that a soldier tell them if they were gay and if they were they would be kicked out.

It was the judges that President Clinton appointed to SCOTUS that allowed marriage rights for all citizens.

Over time Hillary became more and more supportive of LGBT rights going as far as she could while still being electable.

Your idea of either forcing people against their will rather than serving the public or being a noble pure ideologue who has absolutely no power to change things for the better, couldn't be more wrong-minded in my opinion. ",2016-10-28 13:43:50+00:00,d9bdz3h,9.0,t1_d9bdkvm,617.0,inthenews

Let us get to know this vile American hating family that is bigger threat to our freedoms than ISIS

&gt;Ann Corkery
&gt;Ann Corkery serves as president of the Wellspring Committee[6] and is a partner at Stein Mitchell Cipollone Beato &amp; Missner LLP. Her official biography describes her as ""an expert communication strategist"" who ""has leveraged her media expertise and sources to shape campaigns and influence outcomes.""[16]
Ann Corkery and her husband Neil are closely involved in a set of nonprofits that seek to advance right-wing judicial and social agendas, several of which receive funding from Wellspring.[4]
As a fundraiser and recruiter, Corkery was ""instrumental"" in launching the Judicial Crisis Network in 2008, according to Open Secrets.[4] At that time Corkery also worked for Robin Arkley's Security National Servicing Corporation, and the two reportedly attended early donor summits of the Koch brothers' political network.[4]
""Arkley helped put Ann in play"" as a liaison to funding for advocacy groups on the right, said one conservative.[4]
In 2008 Corkery also served as vice chair for finance of Mitt Romney's presidential campaign and took over the Kochs' Wellspring Committee.&gt; While Corkery's ties to the Kochs reportedly ""frayed"" after that, she continued to raise funds from other Koch network donors, including Paul Singer and John Templeton.[4]
In 2011, Corkery replaced the other two board members of Wellspring, John Klink and Stever Wagner, with her daughter Kathleen and Michael Casey, whose father was a board member of JCN alongside Neil Corkery.[4]
Corkery had a history in Religious Right activism prior to her involvement with Wellspring and JCN. She has served on the board or acted as an officer for the Catholic League, the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, the National Organization for Marriage, and the Judicial Crisis Network.[1] She and her husband Neil Corkery, are known for their ""significant political contributors to Republican social conservative candidates"" including former Senator Rick Santorum.[17] In ""2003, she was appointed by President Bush to be a delegate to the United Nations General Assembly, where she fought for a ban on human cloning; he also made her a delegate to the UN Commission on the Status of Women.""[1]
Neil Corkery serves as treasurer of JCN, president of JCN's Judicial Education Project, and executive director of the Sudan Relief Fund, and is affiliated with the National Organization for Marriage, ActRight Action, the Catholic Association Foundation, and Catholic Voices.[4]

498,"Let us learn a litte about this vile group known as ""FACT""

&gt;As we and others have noted, the Judicial Crisis Network, the primary outside group backing the Senate GOP’s blockade of President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, is funded almost entirely by a dark-money group connected to a single family of conservative donors.

&gt;On Friday, Open Secrets uncovered that the same dark-money network funding JCN is behind another group that is working to oppose Merrick Garland’s nomination: the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT).

&gt; Open Secrets reports that FACT, which styles itself as a right-wing alternative to Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), receives all of its funding through Donor’s Trust, a donor-advised fund that acts as a “pass-through vessel” for conservative funders, making the source of contributions all but impossible to trace. But Open Secrets found evidence linking FACT to the Corkery family, who are behind a number of conservative groups including JCN. JCN and FACT share a treasurer, Neil Corkery, and FACT has the same front address as a number of Corkery-linked groups.

&gt;The executive director of FACT and the sole paid employee listed on its most recent tax filing is Matt Whitaker, a former U.S. Attorney from Iowa who we here at Right Wing Watch remember from his unsuccessful run for his home state’s Republican Senate nomination in 2014 (it ultimately went to now-Sen. Joni Ernst). When asked at a debate what criteria he would use to determine whether to support or attempt to block President Obama’s federal judicial nominees, Whitaker said that he would ask if nominees are “people of faith” and “have a biblical view of justice.”

499,"&gt; What I cannot fathom is how any reasonably intelligent person could think she isn't an evil, self-serving, corporate-shilling, career politician who is completely amoral.

Hillary Clinton has been fighting for women and children since she graduated College.  It's remarkable that people that consider themselves ""reasonably intelligent"" would turn around and call her ""evil"".

One of the even more disturbing trends (and this is just not you) is the idea that politicians who are pragmatic and try to get things done and serve the people and give the people what they want are ""self-serving"".   To make that claim one needs to believe the corollary that to force one's ideology using the power of one's office is somehow good and noble.   Frankly I am not inclined to assign people who force their views on others rather than be a ""career politician"" who views their role as public servant is someone how a good thing",2016-10-27 19:54:55+00:00,d9afo8f,3.0,t1_d9af2yt,709.0,inthenews

You just made a claim that is impossible for you to know to be true.  I mean wikileaks has lied about their mission or at least badly misrepresented it, so why should anything they say be believed?

&gt; But this is not the first time Wikileaks has served Russian interests. Since Wikileaks’ inception, it has targeted mainly the United States and its allies. Wikileaks claims to “open governments” and advocate for global transparency, but it has never published any leaks of Russian documents or those that could be detrimental to the Kremlin’s policies. Assange, who for a while hosted a talk show on Russia Today, also played a key role in facilitating the defection of former NSA employee Edward Snowden, who stole hundreds of thousands of American intelligence documents, and who found sanctuary in Moscow. Four months ago, when a large international consortium of news organizations published the “Panama Papers,” detailing how politicians and businesspeople from around the world, including a large group of Russians with very close ties to Putin, had used offshore bank accounts to hide away billions, Assange rubbished them for serving the U.S. government’s interests.

Eleven nations voted against the resolution, while 58 abstained, and a further 24 states were absent when the vote took place.
The resolution was introduced by Canada, Costa Rica, Germany, Lithuania, Poland and Ukraine.[1] The adoption of the resolution was preceded by the unsuccessful attempts of the United Nations Security Council, that convened seven sessions to address the Crimean crisis, only to face Russian veto.[2]

United Nations General Assembly Resolution 68/262 was adopted on March 27, 2014 by the sixty-eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly in response to the Russian annexation of Crimea and entitled ""Territorial integrity of Ukraine"". The non-binding resolution, which was supported by 100 United Nations member states, affirmed the General Assembly's commitment to the territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders and underscored the invalidity of the 2014 Crimean referendum. Eleven nations voted against the resolution, while 58 abstained, and a further 24 states were absent when the vote took place.
The resolution was introduced by Canada, Costa Rica, Germany, Lithuania, Poland and Ukraine.[1] The adoption of the resolution was preceded by the unsuccessful attempts of the United Nations Security Council, that convened seven sessions to address the Crimean crisis, only to face Russian veto.[2]

&gt;Trump would go into the store with his wife, his girlfriend, his…whatever (to use his vernacular). He would then buy her an expensive necklace or wristwatch. Normally, such a transaction would face the New York city and state sales tax, which would be pretty high on luxury jewelry.

&gt;In an illegal attempt to evade the tax, Trump “asked” the store to instead ship the jewelry to an out of state location, where no New York sales tax could be collected. In fact, the store would merely send an empty jewelry box to the location, while Trump and his lady friends walked out the door with the jewelry that very day.

&gt;The state and city tax collectors eventually caught onto this scheme, and Trump promptly testified against his erstwhile tax evasion colluding partners at the jewelry store in order to save his own skin.

He’s the 70-year-old toddler who knows nearly nothing, hurls insults, has simplistic solutions for complex problems and is quick to throw a tantrum. Also, in case you didn’t know it, this toddler is mean to girls and is a bit of a bigot.

&gt; It isn’t so much that he is a strict disciple of radical ideology, but rather that he is devoid of fixed principles, willing to do anything and everything to gain fame, fortune and power. He has an endless, consuming need for perpetual affirmation. This is a bully who just wants to be liked, a man-boy nursing a nagging internal emptiness.

&gt; He’s fickle and spoiled and rotten.

&gt; So, when he loses at something, anything, he lashes out. When someone chastises him for bad behavior, he chafes. This is the kind of silver-spoon scion quick to yell at those he views as less privileged, and therefore less-than, “Do you know who I am?”

&gt; When Hillary Rodham graduated from Yale Law School in 1973, she began working for civil rights advocate Marian Wright Edelman and the Children's Defense Fund in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Hillary traveled to South Carolina to end the unjust incarceration of teenagers in adult prisons---which she eventually did. She also investigated 200 so-called ""private academies"" in Alabama that were receiving a tax-exempt status---despite, as Hillary discovered, secretly turning away black families. Hillary's attempts at fighting systemic racism were highly successful. The unjust incarceration in South Carolina came to an end, and the segregated white academies in Alabama lost their tax-exempt status due to her investigations.

2801,"It's ironic that people who are badly misinformed by the over consumption of FAUX news and right wing websites would call others ""brainwashed"" 

Here are the Nazi's 25 point plan.  You could easily see them fitting in the trump/GOP platform

1. We demand the union of all Germans in a Great Germany on the basis of the principle of self-determination of all peoples.

2. We demand that the German people have rights equal to those of other nations; and that the Peace Treaties of Versailles and St. Germain shall be abrogated.

3. We demand land and territory (colonies) for the maintenance of our people and the settlement of our surplus population.

4. Only those who are our fellow countrymen can become citizens. Only those who have German blood, regardless of creed, can be our countrymen. Hence no Jew can be a countryman.

5. Those who are not citizens must live in Germany as foreigners and must be subject to the law of aliens.

6. The right to choose the government and determine the laws of the State shall belong only to citizens. We therefore demand that no public office, of whatever nature, whether in the central government, the province, or the municipality, shall be held by anyone who is not a citizen.

We wage war against the corrupt parliamentary administration whereby men are appointed to posts by favor of the party without regard to character and fitness.

7. We demand that the State shall above all undertake to ensure that every citizen shall have the possibility of living decently and earning a livelihood. If it should not be possible to feed the whole population, then aliens (non-citizens) must be expelled from the Reich.

8. Any further immigration of non-Germans must be prevented. We demand that all non-Germans who have entered Germany since August 2, 1914, shall be compelled to leave the Reich immediately.

9. All citizens must possess equal rights and duties.

10. The first duty of every citizen must be to work mentally or physically. No individual shall do any work that offends against the interest of the community to the benefit of all.

Therefore we demand:

11. That all unearned income, and all income that does not arise from work, be abolished.

12. Since every war imposes on the people fearful sacrifices in blood and treasure, all personal profit arising from the war must be regarded as treason to the people. We therefore demand the total confiscation of all war profits.

13. We demand the nationalization of all trusts.

14. We demand profit-sharing in large industries.

15. We demand a generous increase in old-age pensions.

16. We demand the creation and maintenance of a sound middle-class, the immediate communalization of large stores which will be rented cheaply to small tradespeople, and the strongest consideration must be given to ensure that small traders shall deliver the supplies needed by the State, the provinces and municipalities.

17. We demand an agrarian reform in accordance with our national requirements, and the enactment of a law to expropriate the owners without compensation of any land needed for the common purpose. The abolition of ground rents, and the prohibition of all speculation in land.

18. We demand that ruthless war be waged against those who work to the injury of the common welfare. Traitors, usurers, profiteers, etc., are to be punished with death, regardless of creed or race.

19. We demand that Roman law, which serves a materialist ordering of the world, be replaced by German common law.

20. In order to make it possible for every capable and industrious German to obtain higher education, and thus the opportunity to reach into positions of leadership, the State must assume the responsibility of organizing thoroughly the entire cultural system of the people. The curricula of all educational establishments shall be adapted to practical life. The conception of the State Idea (science of citizenship) must be taught in the schools from the very beginning. We demand that specially talented children of poor parents, whatever their station or occupation, be educated at the expense of the State.

21. The State has the duty to help raise the standard of national health by providing maternity welfare centers, by prohibiting juvenile labor, by increasing physical fitness through the introduction of compulsory games and gymnastics, and by the greatest possible encouragement of associations concerned with the physical education of the young.

22. We demand the abolition of the regular army and the creation of a national (folk) army.

23. We demand that there be a legal campaign against those who propagate deliberate political lies and disseminate them through the press. In order to make possible the creation of a German press, we demand:

(a) All editors and their assistants on newspapers published in the German language shall be German citizens.

(b) Non-German newspapers shall only be published with the express permission of the State. They must not be published in the German language.

(c) All financial interests in or in any way affecting German newspapers shall be forbidden to non-Germans by law, and we demand that the punishment for transgressing this law be the immediate suppression of the newspaper and the expulsion of the non-Germans from the Reich.

Newspapers transgressing against the common welfare shall be suppressed. We demand legal action against those tendencies in art and literature that have a disruptive influence upon the life of our folk, and that any organizations that offend against the foregoing demands shall be dissolved.

24. We demand freedom for all religious faiths in the state, insofar as they do not endanger its existence or offend the moral and ethical sense of the Germanic race.

The party as such represents the point of view of a positive Christianity without binding itself to any one particular confession. It fights against the Jewish materialist spirit within and without, and is convinced that a lasting recovery of our folk can only come about from within on the pinciple:

COMMON GOOD BEFORE INDIVIDUAL GOOD

25. In order to carry out this program we demand: the creation of a strong central authority in the State, the unconditional authority by the political central parliament of the whole State and all its organizations.

The formation of professional committees and of committees representing the several estates of the realm, to ensure that the laws promulgated by the central authority shall be carried out by the federal states.

The leaders of the party undertake to promote the execution of the foregoing points at all costs, if necessary at the sacrifice of their own lives.",2016-09-29 18:59:22+00:00,d879r4o,3.0,t1_d879d88,495.0,politics

3753,"Edward Fallone, an associate professor of law at Marquette University Law School, called the Republican blockade an “unconstitutional power grab.”

The Constitution, he said, is clear: The role of the president is to appoint a nominee, and the role of the Senate is to provide advice and consent on the nominee.

By refusing to consider any nominee, Fallone claims the Senate is asserting a pre-nomination power that doesn't exist under the Constitution.

Senate Republicans have said they want to wait until after the election to give the American voters a chance to decide who replaces the late Justice Antonin Scalia, but the legal scholars on the call say the people have already decided.

“The people elected President Obama twice,” said Verna Williams, a Judge Joseph P. Kinneary professor of law at the University of Cincinnati College of Law. “And I dare say when they reelected him they knew what his judicial philosophy was.”

Yes I agree and you need to be mindful of where a source is coming from.

Take your quotes from the FBI director.  Careful research reveals he gives large sums of money to Republican candidates for President.   So the opinions he expressed need to be seen through the lens of a man that wants to see a Republican President and not Hillary Clinton.

Those donations and the FBI directors partisan politics have been buried by the right wing controlled MSM

&gt;  She has been caught lying

If one researches one finds that Hillary lies about as often as Bernie which by politician standards is not all that much.  On the other hand even by political standards Donald is a pathological liar

As for who to trust, Hillary has a long history or working for and fighting for common Americans.

Donald has a long history of fleecing the common American out of their life's savings with ventures like Trump University or screwing over hard working small business man with unethical use of bankruptcy laws.   Donald is running on a platform of hatred, racism and sexism

The phrase is often used as a pejorative because of the inherently deceptive nature of the practice and because the dog-whistle messages are frequently distasteful to the general populace. The analogy is to a dog whistle, whose high-frequency whistle is heard by dogs but inaudible to humans.

For those that don't remember:

Todd had worked as a field representative for the College Republican National Committee since August 2008 and had come to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in mid-October to recruit college students.[3] On October 22, 2008, Todd claimed that she was robbed at knifepoint by a ""six-foot-four African American of medium build, dressed in dark clothes wearing shiny shoes"" at a Citizens Bank ATM in the Bloomfield neighborhood of Pittsburgh. She also alleged that after the robber saw a McCain bumper sticker on Todd's car, he assaulted her, cut a reversed letter B into her cheek,[4] and told her ""you are going to be a Barack supporter.""[5]
Todd's story received international attention, including prominent coverage on Drudge Report and Fox News. John Moody, executive vice president at Fox News, commented in a blog on the network's website that ""this incident could become a watershed event in the 11 days before the election,"" but also warned that ""[i]f the incident turns out to be a hoax, Senator McCain’s quest for the presidency is over, forever linked to race-baiting.""

A review of what is being talked about shows that once Bernie lost the whole ""capitalism is evil"" idea lost with him.   Nothing changed in that regard.

Hell even on the major skew to Bernie /Politics you are not seeing any discussions of the evil of capitalism.  It's all about Hillary's email server and Trumps racist comment du jour.

5239,"Anti-Science?  Is that because I rigidly adhere to the scientific principles I was raised on?

The benefits of free trade and NAFTA far outweigh the costs

None of the economists surveyed disagreed that the gains to freer trade are much larger than any costs. And only two economists even said that the answer is uncertain. In a space for additional comments, MIT's Richard Schmalensee declared ""If that's not right, almost all of economics is wrong"".

Economists have emphasized the benefits of free trade for a long time, reflecting the field's belief in the importance of specialization, comparative advantage, and gains from trade. Indeed, these results are similar to other surveys that show economists strongly supporting free trade.

So why do pundits and voters lag economists in supporting free trade? In his excellent book The Myth of the Rational Voter, Bryan Caplan provides evidence that people suffer from a handful of systematic biases that influence their beliefs, and three of these can help explain why voters are skeptical of trade: anti-market bias, anti-foreign bias, and pessimism bias.

Paul Krugman provides three reasons why intellectuals in particular resist the theory of comparative advantage that underpins free trade: 1) opposition to free trade is intellectually fashionable, 2) comparative advantage is hard to understand, and 3) they are averse to a fundamentally mathematical understanding of the world.

As is reflected in the comments by some of the panelists trade will create winners and losers, which may also explain some opposition to trade. But economists on the left and the right still struggle the understand the level of opposition to trade, and the rejection of the overall gains. Whatever their reasons for resisting, people should follow economists lead and embrace the fact that the gains from freer trade outweigh the costs.

― Booker T. Washington

It is easy to hate and it is difficult to love. This is how the whole scheme of things works. All good things are difficult to achieve; and bad things are very easy to get.     

Confucius

Hating people is like burning down your own house to get rid of a rat.

Eldridge Cleaver

Victoria Wolff

Hate destroys the very structure of the personality of the hater.... when you start hating anybody, it destroys the very center of your creative response to life and the universe; so love everybody.

All polling studies that were done, for both the 2000 and the 2004 U.S. Presidential elections, indicated that Nader drained at least 2 to 5 times as many voters from the Democratic candidate as he did from the Republican Bush. (This isn’t even considering throw-away Nader voters who would have stayed home and not voted if Nader had not been in the race; they didn’t count in these calculations at all.) Nader’s 97,488 Florida votes contained vastly more than enough to have overcome the official Jeb Bush / Katherine Harris / count, of a 537-vote Florida “victory” for G.W. Bush. In their 24 April 2006 detailed statistical analysis of the 2000 Florida vote, “Did Ralph Nader Spoil a Gore Presidency?” (available on the internet), Michael C. Herron of Dartmouth and Jeffrey B. Lewis of UCLA stated flatly, “We find that ... Nader was a spoiler for Gore.” David Paul Kuhn, CBSNews.com Chief Political Writer, headlined on 27 July 2004, “Nader to Crash Dems Party?” and he wrote: “In 2000, Voter News Service exit polling showed that 47 percent of Nader’s Florida supporters would have voted for Gore, and 21 percent for Mr. Bush, easily covering the margin of Gore’s loss.” Nationwide, Harvard’s Barry C. Burden, in his 2001 paper at the American Political Science Association, “Did Ralph Nader Elect George W. Bush?” (also on the internet) presented “Table 3: Self-Reported Effects of Removing Minor Party Candidates,” showing that in the VNS exit polls, 47.7% of Nader’s voters said they would have voted instead for Gore, 21.9% said they would have voted instead for Bush, and 30.5% said they wouldn’t have voted in the Presidential race, if Nader were had not been on the ballot. (This same table also showed that the far tinier nationwide vote for Patrick Buchanan would have split almost evenly between Bush and Gore if Buchanan hadn’t been in the race: Buchanan was not a decisive factor in the outcome.) The Florida sub-sample of Nader voters was actually too small to draw such precise figures, but Herron and Lewis concluded that approximately 60% of Florida’s Nader voters would have been Gore voters if the 2000 race hadn’t included Nader. Clearly, Ralph Nader drew far more votes from Gore than he did from Bush, and on this account alone was an enormous Republican asset in 2000.

In other books and columns for conservative websites such as WorldNetDaily and Human Events, Corsi has discussed topics that are considered conspiracy theories, such as the alleged plans for a North American Government, the theory that President Barack Obama is not an American citizen;[6] criticism of the United States government for allegedly covering up information about the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001,[7] promoting the Abiogenic hypothesis of the origin of oil (arguing that oil is produced from chemical reactions in the Earth, in contrast to the general consensus of the scientific community that oil is produced from organic materials, such as zooplankton and algae), and alleged United States support of Iran in its attempts to develop nuclear weapons.[8][9][10]

5895,"&gt; No. I tried to explain why the TPP is important.

You posted a video of Robert Riech who has been less than honest when he spoke about TPP.  I trained myself years ago to spot the signs of dishonesty.

When Robert said that only the executives and MAJOR shareholders would benefit from TPP, alarm bells went off.   All shareholders benefit not just the major ones.  Employees also benefit but no doubt Robert ""forgot"" to mention them because it didn't fit his agenda.

I look for more impartial judges such as the World Bank or the ITC

An analysis by the World Bank found that if ratified by signatories, the TPP ""agreement could raise GDP in member countries by an average of 1.1 percent by 2030. It could also increase member countries’ trade by 11 percent by 2030, and represent a boost to regional trade growth, which had slowed to about 5 percent, on average, during 2010-14 from about 10 percent during 1990-07.""[57] The World Bank finds that the agreement will raise real wages in all signatories: ""In the United States, for example, changes in real wages are expected to be small as unskilled and skilled wages increase by 0.4 and 0.6 percent, respectively, by 2030. In contrast, in Vietnam, TPP could increase the real wages of unskilled workers by more than 14 percent by 2030, as production intensive in unskilled labor (e.g. textiles) shifts to Vietnam.""[57]
An analysis by the U.S. International Trade Commission, an independent, bipartisan, quasi-judicial, federal agency of the United States, estimates that ""TPP would have positive effects, albeit small as a percentage of the overall size of the U.S. economy"".[55] By 2032, U.S. annual real income would increase by 0.23%, real GDP would be $42.7 billion or 0.15% higher, employment would be 0.07% higher, US exports would increase 1%, and imports would increase 1.1%.[55] The report added, ""TPP would generally establish trade-related disciplines that strengthen and harmonize regulations, increase certainty, and decrease trade costs for firms that trade and invest in the TPP region.""[55] Vietnam is often seen as the biggest beneficiary of TPP.[58][59][60]

Take for example 2000 when a Republican Supreme court appointed George Bush to be President against the will of the voters.   Never has one branch of government wielded and abused so much power and never were there ever greater negative consequences.

Consider the Republican Citizens United Ruling that stole the political power from the people in favor of the wealthy and ensured the GOP a huge advantage in controlling the government on the behalf of the one percent.

Consider the rights that have been one such as gay marriage and desegregation that came from a republican judge breaking ranks and joining the liberal/Democratic judges.

For all your criticism of Bill Clinton you fail to credit him with appointing two key liberal judges that stopped the string of liberty hating justices the Republicans had been staking the court with such as Scalia and Thomas.

There are so many weaknesses among liberals (although clearly not with the groups signing the letter) in terms of strategy and understanding how to get things done and get their way.

For example instead of liberals focusing on winning the hearts and minds of the population, they are more focused on forcing politicians to do what they want even if it's unpopular (which usually results in non-conservative politicians losing their office to a conservative).

Second they fail to recognize how important stopping the enemy is.  It's sort of like you need to put out the fire before you start rebuilding a house.

That's a bit of an arrogant comparison in my opinion.  The GOP was formed to fight slavery an evil on a scale that simply doesn't compare to issues of today.   Still it didn't take long from their 1854 beginnings to Lincoln's election in 1860.  It's not like these 3rd parties of today that for decades have only served to siphon off votes from Democrats and helped the GOP stay in power and enact horrible wars and economic policies.  It's not like the early GOP was helping a racist madman get elected President as we have today.

&gt; Were they just trying to burn the nation to the ground? Seriously what kind of fucking rhetoric is that? 

Never has our nation faced a peril (short of the Civil war and WW 2) that it does with the prospects of a racist madman as President and a political party (the GOP) that is working to systematically steal people's right to vote in the name of imaginary voter fraud.

Armed with the confidence that the Special Forces could carry out the mission, it was decision time. So on Thursday, April 28, 2011, the president gathered his advisers in the Situation Room, located below ground level in the White House.

“There was no consensus,” Biden said.  “The president on the last day got us all down in the Situation Room and he said, ‘Okay, it’s basically a roll call.’”

Secretary of Defense Robert Gates recommended an air strike with no forces on the ground.  **CIA Director Panetta supported a raid by Special Forces and so did Secretary of State Clinton.** Vice President Biden wanted to wait on further proof that bin Laden was indeed in the compound.

“It was never contentious because I think everybody understood both the pros and cons of the action,” Obama said.  “People who were advocating action understood that if this did not work, if we proved to be wrong, there would be severe geopolitical consequences and obviously most importantly, we might be putting our brave Navy SEALs in danger.”

6052,"Yes and Hillary is factually proven and experts agree she is fundamentally honest

And this claim of unabated mendacity is particularly interesting, because while it is not the oldest defamation aimed at Hillary, it is the one that most effortlessly glides across partisan lines. Indeed, for a surprisingly large percentage of the electorate, the claim that Hillary is innately dishonest is simply accepted as a given. It is an accusation and conviction so ingrained in the conversation about her that any attempt to even question it is often met with shock. And yet here’s the thing: it’s not actually true. Politifact, the Pulitzer prize-winning fact-checking project, determined for example that Hillary was actually the most truthful candidate (of either Party) in the 2016 election season. And in general Politifact has determined that Hillary is more honest than most (but not all) politicians they have tracked over the years.

Also instructive is Jill Abramson’s recent piece in the Guardian. Abramson, a former reporter for the Wall Street Journal as well as former Executive Editor of the New York Times, had this to say about Hillary’s honesty: “As an editor I’ve launched investigations into her business dealings, her fundraising, her foundation and her marriage. As a reporter my stories stretch back to Whitewater. I’m not a favorite in Hillaryland. That makes what I want to say next surprising. Hillary Clinton is fundamentally honest and trustworthy.”

Notice how Abramson uses the word “surprising”? She’s obviously doing that for our benefit, because she knows that many readers will be astonished at the very thought of Hillary being “fundamentally honest”. But why? In my opinion we need to go back to the time of Whitewater in order to answer that question.

In January of 1996, while Whitewater investigations were underway but unfinished, conservative writer William Safire wrote a scathing and now-famous essay about Hillary Clinton entitled, “Blizzard of Lies”. In the piece he called her a “congenital liar”, and accused her of forcing her friends and subordinates into a “web of deceit”. He insisted (without any apparent evidence) that she took bribes, evaded taxes, forced her own attorneys to perjure themselves, “bamboozled” bank regulators, and was actively involved in criminal enterprises that defrauded the government of millions of dollars. He ended the piece by stating that, “She had good reasons to lie; she is in the longtime habit of lying; and she has never been called to account for lying herself or in suborning lying in her aides and friends.”

I am no political historian, but as far as I can tell this short essay was the birth of the “Hillary is a Liar” meme. Now to be clear, most conservatives already strongly disliked her. They had been upset with her for some time because she had refused to play the traditional First Lady role. And they were horrified by her attempt to champion Universal Health coverage. But if you look for the actual reasons people didn’t like her back at that time, you won’t see ongoing accusations of her being “crooked” or a “liar”. Instead, the most common opinion seemed to be that she was a self-righteous leftist who considered anyone with other views to be morally inferior. In short, the prevailing anti-Hillary accusation was not that she was unrelentingly dishonest, but that she was just intolerably smug.

After the Safire piece however, this all changed. Republicans, who learned from Nixon never to let a good propaganda opportunity pass if they could help it, repeated the accusations of mendacity non-stop to anyone who would broadcast or print them. And if you doubt the staying power of Safire’s piece, type the phrase “congenital liar” into a Google search along with “Hillary Clinton” and see what happens. To this day, that exact phrase is still proudly used by many on the right. This, even though Safire was eventually proven wrong about everything he had written. And despite the fact that he stated himself that he would have to “eat crow” if she were ever cleared, Safire never apologized or even acknowledged his many errors once that happened. Because as we all know, swift-boating means never having to say you’re sorry.

But while conservative propaganda and lies are a constant in “Hillaryland”, if we look at Hillary’s career, and the negative attacks so often aimed at her, it seems clear that more than just political machinations are at play. My current conviction is that the main fuel that powers the anti-Hillary crowd is sexism. And yes I’m serious. So go ahead and roll your eyes. Get it over with. But I think the evidence supports my view, and I’ve seen no other plausible explanation. And just to be clear, I don’t think it’s ONLY sexism. But I do think that this is the primary force that has generated and maintained most of the negative narratives about Hillary.

6065,"And this claim of unabated mendacity is particularly interesting, because while it is not the oldest defamation aimed at Hillary, it is the one that most effortlessly glides across partisan lines. Indeed, for a surprisingly large percentage of the electorate, the claim that Hillary is innately dishonest is simply accepted as a given. It is an accusation and conviction so ingrained in the conversation about her that any attempt to even question it is often met with shock. And yet here’s the thing: it’s not actually true. Politifact, the Pulitzer prize-winning fact-checking project, determined for example that Hillary was actually the most truthful candidate (of either Party) in the 2016 election season. And in general Politifact has determined that Hillary is more honest than most (but not all) politicians they have tracked over the years.

Also instructive is Jill Abramson’s recent piece in the Guardian. Abramson, a former reporter for the Wall Street Journal as well as former Executive Editor of the New York Times, had this to say about Hillary’s honesty: “As an editor I’ve launched investigations into her business dealings, her fundraising, her foundation and her marriage. As a reporter my stories stretch back to Whitewater. I’m not a favorite in Hillaryland. That makes what I want to say next surprising. Hillary Clinton is fundamentally honest and trustworthy.”

Notice how Abramson uses the word “surprising”? She’s obviously doing that for our benefit, because she knows that many readers will be astonished at the very thought of Hillary being “fundamentally honest”. But why? In my opinion we need to go back to the time of Whitewater in order to answer that question.

In January of 1996, while Whitewater investigations were underway but unfinished, conservative writer William Safire wrote a scathing and now-famous essay about Hillary Clinton entitled, “Blizzard of Lies”. In the piece he called her a “congenital liar”, and accused her of forcing her friends and subordinates into a “web of deceit”. He insisted (without any apparent evidence) that she took bribes, evaded taxes, forced her own attorneys to perjure themselves, “bamboozled” bank regulators, and was actively involved in criminal enterprises that defrauded the government of millions of dollars. He ended the piece by stating that, “She had good reasons to lie; she is in the longtime habit of lying; and she has never been called to account for lying herself or in suborning lying in her aides and friends.”

I am no political historian, but as far as I can tell this short essay was the birth of the “Hillary is a Liar” meme. Now to be clear, most conservatives already strongly disliked her. They had been upset with her for some time because she had refused to play the traditional First Lady role. And they were horrified by her attempt to champion Universal Health coverage. But if you look for the actual reasons people didn’t like her back at that time, you won’t see ongoing accusations of her being “crooked” or a “liar”. Instead, the most common opinion seemed to be that she was a self-righteous leftist who considered anyone with other views to be morally inferior. In short, the prevailing anti-Hillary accusation was not that she was unrelentingly dishonest, but that she was just intolerably smug.

After the Safire piece however, this all changed. Republicans, who learned from Nixon never to let a good propaganda opportunity pass if they could help it, repeated the accusations of mendacity non-stop to anyone who would broadcast or print them. And if you doubt the staying power of Safire’s piece, type the phrase “congenital liar” into a Google search along with “Hillary Clinton” and see what happens. To this day, that exact phrase is still proudly used by many on the right. This, even though Safire was eventually proven wrong about everything he had written. And despite the fact that he stated himself that he would have to “eat crow” if she were ever cleared, Safire never apologized or even acknowledged his many errors once that happened. Because as we all know, swift-boating means never having to say you’re sorry.

But while conservative propaganda and lies are a constant in “Hillaryland”, if we look at Hillary’s career, and the negative attacks so often aimed at her, it seems clear that more than just political machinations are at play. My current conviction is that the main fuel that powers the anti-Hillary crowd is sexism. And yes I’m serious. So go ahead and roll your eyes. Get it over with. But I think the evidence supports my view, and I’ve seen no other plausible explanation. And just to be clear, I don’t think it’s ONLY sexism. But I do think that this is the primary force that has generated and maintained most of the negative narratives about Hillary.

How about this then

Centre for Research on Globalization[edit]
In 2001, Chossudovsky founded the Centre for Research on Globalization, becoming its editor and director. Located in Montreal, Canada, it describes itself as an ""independent research and media organization"" that provides ""analysis on issues which are barely covered by the mainstream media"".[10] It maintains websites in several languages, including English, which are critical of United States foreign policy and NATO as well as the official explanation of the September 11 attacks in 2001 and the war on terror.
In a January 2012 article, he characterized the Free Syrian Army as ""a de facto paramilitary creation of NATO.""[11] In the National Post, Terry Glavin quoted Chossudovsky's characterisation of the 'Syrian revolt' as a revolt of ""Islamists, Salafi as well as Muslim Brotherhood gunmen, [-] death squads supported directly by Turkey and Israel"".[12] According to The Guardian newspaper, a cache of intercepted emails to and from Syrian president Bashar al-Assad's private account included one from his father-in-law, Fawaz Akhras, citing Chossudovsky's claims and asking Assad how true they were.[13] Chossudovsky claimed that deaths of protesters during the Euromaidan demonstrations in Ukraine were ""triggered by Neo-Nazi elements"", used ""to break the legitimacy of a duly elected government.""[14]
In 2005, The Jewish Tribune criticized the Centre for Research on Globalization's website for being ""rife with anti-Jewish conspiracy theory and Holocaust denial."" Chossudovsky responded that he is of Jewish heritage and would be one of the last people to condone antisemitic views.[15] The same article also reported that B'nai B'rith Canada wrote a letter to the University of Ottawa asking for the university ""to conduct its own investigation of this propagandist site.""[15]

The GOP hurt the nation badly when they took the position to completely obstruct President Obama as he tried to fix the nation's broken economy.

The Urban League had sent black and white testers to apply for apartments in Trump-owned complexes; the whites got the apartments, the blacks did not. According to court records, four superintendents or rental agents reported that applications sent to the central office for acceptance or rejection were coded by race. A 1979 Village Voice article quoted a rental agent who said Trump instructed him not to rent to black people and to encourage existing black tenants to leave. In 1975, a consent decree described by the head of DOJ’s housing division as ""one of the most far-reaching ever negotiated,"" required Trump to advertise vacancies in minority papers and list vacancies with the Urban League. The Justice Department subsequently complained that continuing ""racially discriminatory conduct by Trump agents has occurred with such frequency that it has created a substantial impediment to the full enjoyment of equal opportunity.""[13]

6271,"No politician is hundred percent honest however  your claims of her being a liar are simply untrue and not supported by the facts


&gt; And this claim of unabated mendacity is particularly interesting, because while it is not the oldest defamation aimed at Hillary, it is the one that most effortlessly glides across partisan lines. Indeed, for a surprisingly large percentage of the electorate, the claim that Hillary is innately dishonest is simply accepted as a given. It is an accusation and conviction so ingrained in the conversation about her that any attempt to even question it is often met with shock. And yet here’s the thing: it’s not actually true. Politifact, the Pulitzer prize-winning fact-checking project, determined for example that Hillary was actually the most truthful candidate (of either Party) in the 2016 election season. And in general Politifact has determined that Hillary is more honest than most (but not all) politicians they have tracked over the years.

&gt; Also instructive is Jill Abramson’s recent piece in the Guardian. Abramson, a former reporter for the Wall Street Journal as well as former Executive Editor of the New York Times, had this to say about Hillary’s honesty: “As an editor I’ve launched investigations into her business dealings, her fundraising, her foundation and her marriage. As a reporter my stories stretch back to Whitewater. I’m not a favorite in Hillaryland. That makes what I want to say next surprising. Hillary Clinton is fundamentally honest and trustworthy.”

&gt; Notice how Abramson uses the word “surprising”? She’s obviously doing that for our benefit, because she knows that many readers will be astonished at the very thought of Hillary being “fundamentally honest”. But why? In my opinion we need to go back to the time of Whitewater in order to answer that question.

&gt; In January of 1996, while Whitewater investigations were underway but unfinished, conservative writer William Safire wrote a scathing and now-famous essay about Hillary Clinton entitled, “Blizzard of Lies”. In the piece he called her a “congenital liar”, and accused her of forcing her friends and subordinates into a “web of deceit”. He insisted (without any apparent evidence) that she took bribes, evaded taxes, forced her own attorneys to perjure themselves, “bamboozled” bank regulators, and was actively involved in criminal enterprises that defrauded the government of millions of dollars. He ended the piece by stating that, “She had good reasons to lie; she is in the longtime habit of lying; and she has never been called to account for lying herself or in suborning lying in her aides and friends.”

6505,"Here you go this legal scholar should enlighten you

MJ: What preconceived notions about the Second Amendment did the history that you uncovered confirm or debunk?

MW: There are surprises in this book for people who support gun control, and people who are for gun rights. When the Supreme Court ruled in Heller, Justice Scalia said he was following his doctrine of originalism. But when you actually go back and look at the debate that went into drafting of the amendment, you can squint and look really hard, but there's simply no evidence of it being about individual gun ownership for self-protection or for hunting. Emphatically, the focus was on the militias. To the framers, that phrase ""a well-regulated militia"" was really critical. In the debates, in James Madison's notes of the Constitutional Convention, on the floor of the House of Representatives as they wrote the Second Amendment, all the focus was about the militias. Now at the same time, those militias are not the National Guard. Every adult man, and eventually every adult white man, was required to be in the militias and was required to own a gun, and to bring it from home. So it was an individual right to fulfill the duty to serve in the militias.

""You can squint and look really hard, but there's simply no evidence of it being about individual gun ownership for self-protection.""
MJ: You point out that the NRA has the Second Amendment inscribed in their lobby, but with the militia clause removed.

MW: Yes. That was first reported in an article in Mother Jones in the '90s. But I didn't want to rely on just that, so one of my colleagues went out to the NRA headquarters to look at the lobby. And she had her picture taken in front of the sign so we could confirm that it was actually still there!

MJ: Based on the history you've uncovered, do you think the founders understood there to be an unwritten individual right to arms that they didn't include in the Constitution?

MW: Yes. And that might be noteworthy for some. There were plenty of guns. There was the right to defend yourself, which was part of English common law handed down from England. But there were also gun restrictions at the same time. There were many. There were limits, for example, on where you could store gunpowder. You couldn't have a loaded gun in your house in Boston. There were lots of limits on who could own guns for all different kinds of reasons. There was an expectation that you should be able to own a gun. But they didn't think they were writing that expectation into the Constitution with the Second Amendment.

MJ: So then why focus on the Second Amendment and not the English Bill of Rights or other things the framers drew on that more clearly address individual gun ownership?

MW: We are not governed today, in 2014, by British common law. Law evolved, the country evolved. It was a very rural place. There were no cities. There were no police forces. It was a completely different way of living. So gun rights activists turned this into a constitutional crusade. Those who want more guns and fewer restrictions realized they could gain some higher ground if they claimed the Constitution.

MJ: You write that throughout most of the 20th century, the courts stayed out of the gun laws debate. What changed that led them back in?

MW: What changed was the NRA. In 1991, former Chief Justice Warren Burger said that the idea that the Second Amendment recognizes an individual right to gun ownership was ""a fraud"" on the public. That was the consensus, that was the conventional wisdom.*

6513,"&gt; la raza 

la raza 
a term often mistakenly translated into english as meaning ""the race"", the true meaning of la raza is much closer to ""the people"". this term cannot be properly defined in english by a simple one word answer due to language differences. i will explain the definition, but first: 

other definitions on this site claim that la raza is a racist organization. they are refferring to a group that calls itself ""national council of la raza"", which they believe is a racist organization; and the people who typed those definitions mistakenly called the group la raza for short, either not knowing that la raza was actually a seperate term, or not knowing the true meaning of the term ""la raza"". 

the term originated in the book ""La Raza Cosmica"" written by José Vasconcelos, a Mexican intellectual (1881-1959). He described la raza cosmica as the product of racial mixing over time that was already in progress (black, white, asian, native american, all becoming racially and culturally mixed due to the events of time, for example the conquest of mexico resulted in mixing of the blood and culture of the natives and the spaniards). He believed that eventually all of the races would be completely mixed into a new race that had the best attributes of all the cultures and would ""show us the way"" so to speak. 

the term caught on as simply ""la raza"" and has come to refer to the people of mexican ancestry(mexican as in from mexico, not specifically the native mexica tribe)wherever they may live at the present time. La raza to us means ""our people"" of common ancestry the same way a proud U.S. citizen might say ""americans"" with the intended meaning as his/her people of this country, all sharing a common background. that is the true meaning of ""la raza"". 

One may note that in the USA there's a political party called ""The United People's Party"". That is a proper translation of it's name ""The Raza Unida Party"", a group created to help support minorities and the poor.
""vive la raza"" ""long live the people"" 

Revolutionary human identity theories of the early 1900s include: 
Marx and Engels ""Das Kapital"", C. Darwin's ""Theory of Evolution of the Species"" , and Jose Vasconcelos's ""La Raza Cosmica"".

Clearly we have different standards of proof.  I demand verifiable fact or reports by reputable sources.  You provide a blog that had ""exclusive"" proof which to me does not rise to the level of verifiable proof.

See this is where the deception is at work.  Hillary has given millions upon millions to the Democratic National Committee which is tasked with getting Democrats elected at every level.

&gt; nd she was supposed to share the donations from wealthy donors with state party. She did not. 

Only the facts are:

According to the Center for Responsive Politics by the end of 2015, the Hillary Victory Fund had given $4.4 million to Clinton, $2.3 million to the DNC, and $2.2 to state political parties. That makes Clinton's share through 2015 almost exactly 50 percent.

That is a 100% untrue statement

&gt; I'm an academic, I value intellectual honesty strongly.

I believe you but sadly your biases and emotions have led you astray.   

&gt;  Take the LGBT movement.

Here is a great example of you failing to adhere to those intellectual honesty principles you strive for.  Let us take the LGBT movement you attacked her on:

When Hillary Clinton mounted her first presidential bid in 2008, Thomas Duane was in her corner.

Then the only openly gay member of the New York State Senate, the Manhattan Democrat hadn't forgotten the time Clinton, seeking a United States Senate seat in 2000, had appeared at an Albany press conference backing Duane's legislation to combat anti-LGBT hate crimes. Her support made an impression on Duane, who joined Clinton's national LGBT steering committee in 2007.

But Duane's support for Clinton didn't come without reservations. Though she favored non-discrimination protections and civil unions for same-sex couples, Clinton didn't support marriage equality at the time, a source of consternation for Duane. 

""I thought she probably was [privately] for marriage and I thought she should say it. I thought she shouldn't be afraid to say it. I didn't really like that,"" Duane recounted to Mic.

Of course, Clinton was hardly a Democratic outlier in opposing same-sex marriage eight years ago. Neither of her leading Democratic opponents, then-Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois and former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina, backed marriage equality; only long-shot hopefuls Dennis Kucinich and Mike Gravel did. The New York Times reported that in California and New York — the only states that asked voters' sexual orientations — Clinton bested Obama among gay voters by 34 points and 23 points, respectively.

6603,"Here you go

Whether born from experience or inherent physiological or cultural differences, a possibility I abhor less or discount less than my colleague Judge Cedarbaum, our gender and national origins may and will make a difference in our judging. Justice O'Connor has often been cited as saying that a wise old man and wise old woman will reach the same conclusion in deciding cases. I am not so sure Justice O'Connor is the author of that line since Professor Resnik attributes that line to Supreme Court Justice Coyle. I am also not so sure that I agree with the statement. First, as Professor Martha Minnow has noted, there can never be a universal definition of wise. Second, I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life.

I, like Professor Carter, believe that we should not be so myopic as to believe that others of different experiences or backgrounds are incapable of understanding the values and needs of people from a different group. Many are so capable. As Judge Cedarbaum pointed out to me, nine white men on the Supreme Court in the past have done so on many occasions and on many issues including Brown.

However, to understand takes time and effort, something that not all people are willing to give. For others, their experiences limit their ability to understand the experiences of others. Other simply do not care. Hence, one must accept the proposition that a difference there will be by the presence of women and people of color on the bench. Personal experiences affect the facts that judges choose to see. My hope is that I will take the good from my experiences and extrapolate them further into areas with which I am unfamiliar. I simply do not know exactly what that difference will be in my judging. But I accept there will be some based on my gender and my Latina heritage.

I will not deny that there is bigotry on the left as well.  Although I think the important difference is candidates generally don't appeal to that bigotry as a campaign strategy.

&gt; Both bigot and racist is thrown around like candy at a parade at this point.

I think it's important to remember those words have powerful meanings and to remember that when you encounter an openly bigoted candidate like Trump

&gt; Also, holding a view point that the GOP is 100% at fault for the issue impacting our country is absurd

may sound absurd but the GOP held meetings after President Obama got elected and the nation hurting obstruction was their strategy of choice.  From their point of view it worked like a charm.  Sure they messed up the nation but they recaptured the House and Senate

&gt; Of course, but the issues we face were created by years of bi-partisan actions...neither party is to be fully blamed.

So does Bernie so this is your admitted bias at work

&gt; Does she not take money from special interests and change her position afterwards?

no, unless you think she took money from donors and bumped up the amount she wants to raise minimum wage

&gt; Did she not claim she helped down ticket democrats and then take everything for her own campaign? 

absolutely not and the fact that all those down ticket Super Delegates supporting her is more than enough proof just how bad and inaccurate this accusation is

&gt; Did she not leak classified material from her illegal private server?

no again

 Did she not switch her position countless times according to what is more popular at the time?

So you think it's wrong for people to be open minded and willing to change their position based on new information and argument.  I will say to you, I think you're wrong about this

&gt;  Does she not shift blame and refuse to take responsibility for her own actions (Saying you take responsibility and taking responsibility is not the same btw)?

seriously?!?!  this is the most wildly false accusation yet.  If anything that's a Bernie trait as he fired up his supporters in Nevada and then blamed others when his people turned violent

&gt; Does she not pander constantly to what is most popular at the time?

That's an out of left field comment.  The point was that bernie was raising funds by making promises in return and was equally beholden to special interests (I am sure those currently working to pay off their own college loans would love to pay for the bernie supporter's education).

To answer your question though I think college should be accessible to all.   That's where it appears we differ.  Odds are I'm older than you.  I entered politics in an era of idealism where it wasn't about fighting for self interest.  It was looking out for what was best for the nation while also protecting the underdog.  

The GOP was the party of self interest populated by white men who didn't want to pay their fair share of taxes and wanted special rights over others.   As a result their tactics were often unethical as would be expected from people driven by selfish interest.

Now sadly I see many of the Bernie supporters being driven not by what is right but rather a ""what's in it for me"" attitude.  It's disheartening to say the least.

That is a rather improper thing to say.  Hillary is a former first lady for 8 years a sitting US Senator and Secretary of State.  

Not to mention of of these early accomplishments (via Wikipedia for easy posting)

February 1977, Rodham joined the venerable Rose Law Firm, a bastion of Arkansan political and economic influence.[74] She specialized in patent infringement and intellectual property law[37] while also working pro bono in child advocacy;[75] she rarely performed litigation work in court.[76]
Rodham maintained her interest in children's law and family policy, publishing the scholarly articles ""Children's Policies: Abandonment and Neglect"" in 1977[77] and ""Children's Rights: A Legal Perspective"" in 1979.[78] The latter continued her argument that children's legal competence depended upon their age and other circumstances and that in serious medical rights cases, judicial intervention was sometimes warranted.[54] An American Bar Association chair later said, ""Her articles were important, not because they were radically new but because they helped formulate something that had been inchoate.""[54] Historian Garry Wills would later describe her as ""one of the more important scholar-activists of the last two decades"",[79] while conservatives said her theories would usurp traditional parental authority,[80] would allow children to file frivolous lawsuits against their parents,[54] and exemplified legal ""crit"" theory run amok.[81]
Small, one-story brick-faced house with small yard in front
Hillary Rodham and Bill Clinton lived in this 980-square-foot (91 m2) house in the Hillcrest neighborhood of Little Rock from 1977 to 1979 while he was Arkansas Attorney General.[82]
In 1977, Rodham cofounded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, a state-level alliance with the Children's Defense Fund.[37][83] Later that year, President Jimmy Carter (for whom Rodham had been the 1976 campaign director of field operations in Indiana)[84] appointed her to the board of directors of the Legal Services Corporation,[85] and she served in that capacity from 1978 until the end of 1981.[86] From mid-1978 to mid-1980,[nb 4] she served as the chair of that board, the first woman to do so.[87] During her time as chair, funding for the Corporation was expanded from $90 million to $300 million; subsequently she successfully fought President Ronald Reagan's attempts to reduce the funding and change the nature of the organization.[75]
Following her husband's November 1978 election as Governor of Arkansas, Rodham became First Lady of Arkansas in January 1979, her title for twelve years (1979–1981, 1983–1992). Clinton appointed her chair of the Rural Health Advisory Committee the same year,[88] where she secured federal funds to expand medical facilities in Arkansas's poorest areas without affecting doctors' fees.[89]

6729,"&gt; Get your facts straight. Nader is in no way responsible

Distinguishing Between Fact, Opinion, Belief, and Prejudice

When forming personal convictions, we often interpret factual evidence through the filter of our values, feelings, tastes, and past experiences. Hence, most statements we make in speaking and writing are assertions of fact, opinion, belief, or prejudice. The usefulness and acceptability of an assertion can be improved or diminished by the nature of the assertion, depending on which of the following categories it falls into: 

A fact is verifiable. We can determine whether it is true by researching the evidence. This may involve numbers, dates, testimony, etc. (Ex.: ""World War II ended in 1945."") The truth of the fact is beyond argument if one can assume that measuring devices or records or memories are correct. Facts provide crucial support for the assertion of an argument. However, facts by themselves are worthless unless we put them in context, draw conclusions, and, thus, give them meaning. 

An opinion is a judgment based on facts, an honest attempt to draw a reasonable conclusion from factual evidence. (For example, we know that millions of people go without proper medical care, and so you form the opinion that the country should institute national health insurance even though it would cost billions of dollars.) An opinion is potentially changeable--depending on how the evidence is interpreted. By themselves, opinions have little power to convince. You must always let your reader know what your evidence is and how it led you to arrive at your opinion. 

Unlike an opinion, a belief is a conviction based on cultural or personal faith, morality, or values. Statements such as ""Capital punishment is legalized murder"" are often called ""opinions"" because they express viewpoints, but they are not based on facts or other evidence. They cannot be disproved or even contested in a rational or logical manner. Since beliefs are inarguable, they cannot serve as the thesis of a formal argument. (Emotional appeals can, of course, be useful if you happen to know that your audience shares those beliefs.) 

Another kind of assertion that has no place in serious argumentation is prejudice, a half-baked opinion based on insufficient or unexamined evidence. (Ex.: ""Women are bad drivers."") Unlike a belief, a prejudice is testable: it can be contested and disproved on the basis of facts. We often form prejudices or accept them from others--family, friends, the media, etc.--without questioning their meaning or testing their truth. At best, prejudices are careless oversimplifications. At worst, they reflect a narrow-minded view of the world. Most of all, they are not likely to win the confidence or agreement of your readers.

a term often mistakenly translated into english as meaning ""the race"", the true meaning of la raza is much closer to ""the people"". this term cannot be properly defined in english by a simple one word answer due to language differences. i will explain the definition, but first: 

other definitions on this site claim that la raza is a racist organization. they are refferring to a group that calls itself ""national council of la raza"", which they believe is a racist organization; and the people who typed those definitions mistakenly called the group la raza for short, either not knowing that la raza was actually a seperate term, or not knowing the true meaning of the term ""la raza"". 

the term originated in the book ""La Raza Cosmica"" written by José Vasconcelos, a Mexican intellectual (1881-1959). He described la raza cosmica as the product of racial mixing over time that was already in progress (black, white, asian, native american, all becoming racially and culturally mixed due to the events of time, for example the conquest of mexico resulted in mixing of the blood and culture of the natives and the spaniards). He believed that eventually all of the races would be completely mixed into a new race that had the best attributes of all the cultures and would ""show us the way"" so to speak. 

the term caught on as simply ""la raza"" and has come to refer to the people of mexican ancestry(mexican as in from mexico, not specifically the native mexica tribe)wherever they may live at the present time. La raza to us means ""our people"" of common ancestry the same way a proud U.S. citizen might say ""americans"" with the intended meaning as his/her people of this country, all sharing a common background. that is the true meaning of ""la raza"". 

One may note that in the USA there's a political party called ""The United People's Party"". That is a proper translation of it's name ""The Raza Unida Party"", a group created to help support minorities and the poor.

honesty-  she is clearly more honest than donald who tells whopper size lies.   Between Hillary and Bernie it's a toss up unless you consider false promises a lie in which case Hillary wins out

Integrity-  Hillary hasn't conned people out of their life's fortune.   I wouldn't argue though based on her unauthorized email server if you would say Bernie has more integrity.  

Fairness-  Hillary certainly has been fair to all people much to the chagrin of the left and the right who both only want fairness for their ""side"".    Bernie is reasonably fair but less so with his suggestion that Super Delegates should ignore the voters and given him the nomination.   donald forget about it, nothing fair about donald and his ""buyer beware"" life attitude

anti-bullying-  Hillary and her supporters lead the pack.  Bernie is equal anti-bully but he loses points for the behavior of his followers.  donald is the biggest want to be bully in the history of Presidential elections

Intelligence-  I think Hillary is clearly the most intelligent although Bernie is very close.  It's clear donald is a notch below in terms of intelligence at least based on his public statements

restraint-  Hillary never loses her cool.  Bernie is reasonably restrained but not in Hillary's class.   Donald is the poster boy for loose cannon 

great leadership-  I think the nod for this goes to Bernie, but Hillary isn't bad.   Donald, is more cult leader or want to be dictator than great leader.  ",2016-06-02 20:05:12+00:00,d3tjfvc,7.0,t1_d3tifih,1305.0,politics

 &gt; There's no such thing as good and evil. Please stop seeing the world in black and white.

That is a remarkable feat... it really is.  You managed to simplify a concept to the point of making it wrong.

Bernie has been deceiving his supporters and conning them out of their hard earned money for months while knowing for months he had lost the primaries and had no chance.

As his selfish interests dominate his words and deeds more and more his dishonesty factor grows proportionately.

It's worse than I thought.  You do nothing while criticizing everyone that is trying to make things better.   You are an embodiment of this quote from the movie Ratatouille 

&gt; In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face, is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so.

Then I looked at the sort of people that Bernie attracts.  When I see such horrible behavior coming from a politician's followers my alarm bells go off.   It tells me there is something wrong with Bernie if the people who Bernie attracts are just as dishonest and nasty and without honor as your typical Tea Party Republican.

It's not too shocking or surprising though.  In one manner Bernie and Trump are very similar.  Both men are playing on the baser instincts of self interest.  Trump plays on the fear of white men that they are losing power and Bernie plays on the greed of young white 20 somethings who want lots and lots of free stuff (plus he offers them hope of getting out of the ridiculous hole most of their college educations have put them in).    The reality is even if Bernie gets elected he will not be able to deliver on any of his promises.   Look at President Obama, he is far more of a moderate President than Bernie would be but that doesn't stop the GOP from taking the ""screw America, we are going to take you down approach"".

You hate her based on a myth?

Following Shuster's report, host Chris Matthews referred to Clinton's statement as ""malarkey"" and added that ""[s]he went to the Yankees so that she could run for senator from New York. It's so obvious. Why is she -- doesn't she know she looks like a fraud?"" However, the idea that Clinton proclaimed herself a Yankees fan only after she decided to run for a New York Senate seat or that she switched allegiance from the Cubs to the Yankees during her Senate campaign is a myth commonly repeated in the media that is not supported by evidence. As Media Matters for America has repeatedly noted, Clinton's 2003 autobiography, Living History (Simon &amp; Schuster), contains a photograph of her wearing a Yankees cap in 1992 -- eight years before she ran for the Senate. Further, The Washington Post reported on September 12, 1994, that ""Mrs. Clinton ... as a kid was a 'big-time' fan of the Chicago Cubs and New York Yankees and 'understudied' Ernie Banks and Mickey Mantle.""

Our ruling

Clinton said she ""called for addressing risks of derivatives, cracking down on subprime mortgages and improving financial oversight"" early on in the financial crisis.

The crisis hit a peak in summer 2008, though it started to gain traction in 2007. Clinton began addressing the subprime mortgage issue in her appearances in March 2007. Later that year, she took on derivatives. She also proposed specific plans for solving these problems and increasing oversight of financial institutions.

Her statement is accurate, and we rate her claim True.

 “none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control.”  Referred to as the Dickey amendment after its author, former U.S. House Representative Jay Dickey (R-AR), this language did not explicitly ban research on gun violence. However, Congress also took $2.6 million from the CDC’s budget — the amount the CDC had invested in firearm injury research the previous year — and earmarked the funds for prevention of traumatic brain injury. Dr. Kellerman stated in a December 2012 article in the Journal of the American Medical Association, “Precisely what was or was not permitted under the clause was unclear. But no federal employee was willing to risk his or her career or the agency's funding to find out. Extramural support for firearm injury prevention research quickly dried up.”

The fact of the matter is the facts don't in any way shape or form assert your assertions.  

Heck I can't even agree with your characterization of her claims as they are full of hyperbole and changes to the point that you are engaging in straw man debate tactics.  You take her down by mischaracterizing her positions and offering distorted takes on her position.

You claim she supports a war in Syria and that's not true.  She supports taking our ISIS in Syria with no fly zones and special forces operations.  So while they are military operations (and ones most Americans support) they could not accurately be termed ""Hillary supports war in Syria).  You did something very similar with Libya.  Even Iraq she voted to support Bush's invasion but you didn't point out that she had been lied to by Bush and his staff about WMDs and the threat Iraq posed.  That's all critical to HONEST debate (what you ironically accuse Hillary of not engaging in).

Here's another example.   You say she is in favor of fracking.  Yet Hillary doesn't support banning fracking but she favors heavy regulation on the practice.   There are Republicans who actually have a position of frack baby frack and those could be fairly characterized as supporting fracking, not Hillary as you tried to claim

Hillary never once called herself ""anti-gun"" yet you make that claim.  Then after making a claim not supported by the facts you shoot it down with ""Obama had to call her Annie Oakley in 2008"".  What does that even mean????

""She's also again the TPP. Yet she called the TPP the gold standard.""

I don't even know what you are trying to say on that one.

Even your prison claim does not hold up to even the weakest of scrutiny.  While you are trying to paint Hillary as a liar you deliberately left out the FACT that Hillary's campaign has stopped accepting donations from private prison companies and gave the donations she had received to charity  Instead you made this fact challenged claim

""Yet private prisons give her more money than any other candidate by a mile""

As for your love of labels consider this (and I strongly urge you to read the entire article)

“Liberal” is an excellent example. The modern political label of liberalism (or is it Liberalism…) is a messy amalgam of countless distinct strains of political thought. The classical liberal movement, defined by its respect for individual liberty and equality, took root during the age of Enlightenment. Great thinkers of the liberal tradition like Locke, Mill, and Rawls have each interpreted the demands of liberty and equality differently, and so have each provided slightly different accounts of liberalism. Over time these accounts diverged so extensively that the contemporary threads of “liberal” thought bear little resemblance to each other. Many might be surprised to learn, for example, that American libertarianism and American liberalism share a common philosophical heritage. Given this astounding conceptual diversity – and the spatial and temporal inconsistencies – the appropriate reaction when someone claims to be a liberal may be one of bewilderment rather than comprehension.

Politicians, of course, get a lot of mileage from this conceptual confusion. It’s easy to adopt a label when it’s convenient and quickly abandon it when it’s not. And the vast majority of us don’t even know when it happens.

A fact is verifiable. We can determine whether it is true by researching the evidence. This may involve numbers, dates, testimony, etc. (Ex.: ""World War II ended in 1945."") The truth of the fact is beyond argument if one can assume that measuring devices or records or memories are correct. Facts provide crucial support for the assertion of an argument. However, facts by themselves are worthless unless we put them in context, draw conclusions, and, thus, give them meaning.

10367,"I have been through many election.  It's truly a rare thing to vote for someone that you truly feel excited about voting for.   The reality is most of the time you are simply voting to try and stop bad things from happening rather than voting to make what you think will be good things (although even then there is never any guarantee that good things will happen.  Congress can often happen).    It's not fair, but life is rarely fair.  
The best you can do is vote to keep the bad people out of power.   With the GOP it's even worse because they have been using the power for decades to rig the deck and keep themselves in power.

The GOP opposes any way to make voting easier like weekend or online voting because they don't like democracy they like power and they know working people don't vote GOP as much as their non-working base.

The GOP has been robbing people of their right to vote in the name if imaginary voter integrity and often slip up and admit they are robbing people of the right to vote out of pure political gain.

The GOP has used the judges they put on the Supreme Court to give them unlimited access to unlimited bribe money through their horrible Citizens United ruling

The GOP used the power of their judges on the Supreme Court to gut the voting rights act Congress had passed, so they can steal more people's right to vote.

Don't even get me started on their illegal gerrymandering.  You know that the majority of people vote Democratic on election day but the GOP still wins the majority in Congress?  That's pretty sick the GOP has no conscience and there is nothing they will not do for power.   They are dangerous people that need to be stopped.  Hell there is an elected Senator in SD who openly stated that a racists would be a better choice for President than any Democrat.   Is that sick or what?

What's remarkable is the arrogance and ignorance of that statement.  I am neither young nor ignorant of the people or what makes people like Mr Drumpf.   

I am little doubt that I am considerably older than you (I just missed being able to for Jimmy Carter).     On top of that with those years on this planet and with very active and diverse life I have come in contact and worked with and hung out with people of all ages, ethnicities, backgrounds, religions and economic status.   I have also learned how those that are inclined to do so can use people's fears and anger to manipulate them by turning those two negative emotions into focused anger.

Mr Drumpf is popular because white people and more particularly white males feel their power slipping away.  They hear non stop from FOX News and Rush Limbaugh and his ilk how minorities are taking their money and stealing their power.   They see a man in the White House with different colored skin then their own.  They are seeing more and more woman in the workplace and worse they are seeing many of those women in positions of authority and power.   They are seeing a country that is becoming more and more ethnically diverse.   That makes many white people fearful or uncomfortable.   Hell I have witnessed it myself.  I have been volunteering in a community organization for 30 years.  When I started the entire organization was white and the crew I worked with with all white.   Now after 30 years the crews are very ethnically diverse and on my own crew I am part of the white minority.   This doesn't trouble me but for many this can cause fear or anger and that can be manipulated into hate.

When Donald Drumpf says ""make America great again"" he is not saying we are still not great.   What he is really saying is ""make America white again""

Since Schefter is not regulated by the Florida's department of professions this chapter doesn't apply to him.  Hence despite JPP's lawyer's claims to the contrary Schefter did not violate Florida law.

Undoubtedly JPP's lawyers know this but when you are suing a party on weak grounds you toss everything in.

“Profession” means any activity, occupation, profession, or vocation regulated by the department in the Division of Medical Quality Assurance.

Now with President Obama we see a Republican party that puts it's political interests and those they sold their political offices to for billions of dollars ahead of the good of the nation.

Oh and saying things like ""The Supreme Court can't create law and didn't with Citizens United"" does change the fact that the Republican Supreme Court ignored the Constitution and created law when the Republicans lead by the evil Scalia made the ruling.

The American Public stayed home thanks to the Billions in bribe money the GOP used to sling mud.   It wasn't like people actually vote for those evil people.  If it wasn't for the GOP robbing people of their right to vote and keeping them home with the false GOP lies they spread via media the GOP would go the way of the Whig party and that would be a great thing for our nation.

I don't advocate a single party but I say the current GOP is a threat to our nation's well being.   We need a new GOP that goes back to its saner roots.  As long as ideological lunatics like Ted Cruz is a serious presidential contender and as long as evil bullies like Trump is their party leader that isn't going to happen.

[The President] shall nominate, and, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.

Now the Senate is constitutionally required to ""advise and consent"".  Failure to vote on appointments or to vote against appointments because you want the next president to effectively have a 5 year term is simply against the Constitution of the United States.

liberals are brave enough not to trample on other people's civil rights out of fear or demand needless quarantines because they are sniveling cowards afraid of a germ or want to build walls because they are afraid of Mexicans nor are they afraid of Muslims

Conservatives are pretty much afraid of everything especially if they are different from them in any way shape or form

Conservatives support the corporate welfare state and huge tax breaks for companies so they pay no taxes and to pay for this they want to tax the poor with a flat tax.  They are the Robinhoods in reverse

Conservatives are frequently racist and when called on it they go on nonsensical verbal rants against liberals (and humorously enough, miss their target as I am not a liberal)

As for child molesters one needs only google republicans and sex offenses to get the answer to that one.

Brian Normandy is an instructor at Jackson Arms. “As long as we don’t have a detachable magazine in it, it’s actually a legal firearm,” Normandy said.

Other states allow people to use their finger to pop out the magazine and quickly reload. It’s called a detachable magazine, and in California, its use in combination with other features such as a telescoping stock or pistol grip is illegal.

The intent is to slow down the process of reloading the weapon. But many target shooters don’t like the reloading hassle. “For me to use this on the range, I would have to open up the receiver and top load it,” said Normandy.

To get around this, gun manufacturers are selling firearms to Californians with what is called a “bullet button.”

The user uses the tip of a bullet to release the empty magazine and pop in a new one. The button doesn’t work with one’s finger, so the magazine is considered “fixed.”

That makes it an assault rifle that everyone is calling “California legal.”",2015-12-04 19:43:30+00:00,cxn9rnv,7.0,t1_cxn9jyw,307.0,politics

I guess this is what you are referring to

The first confirmed attack on rescuers took place in North Waziristan on May 16 2009. According to Mushtaq Yusufzai, a local journalist, Taliban militants had gathered in the village of Khaisor. After praying at the local mosque, they were preparing to cross the nearby border into Afghanistan to launch an attack on US forces. But the US struck first.

A CIA drone fired its missiles into the Taliban group, killing at least a dozen people. Villagers joined surviving Taliban as they tried to retrieve the dead and injured.

But as rescuers clambered through the demolished house the drones struck again. Two missiles slammed into the rubble, killing many more. At least 29 people died in total.

‘We lost very trained and sincere friends‘, a local Taliban commander told The News, a Pakistani newspaper. ‘Some of them were very senior Taliban commanders and had taken part in successful actions in Afghanistan. Bodies of most of them were beyond recognition.’

adopt our ideas and ideals, and help in fulfilling our
destiny along those lines, but never that they should be
permitted to force us to change into anything else.
This is the basic idea of the Klan. There is, perhaps,
much to be said for the liberal idea of making America
a mongrel nation, but that involves the two points
which, as I have pointed out, the Klan will not debate.
We hold firmly that America belongs to Americans,
and should be kept American. . . . The whole purpose
of the Klan is to bring this belief to fulfillment. We
make many mistakes, but we are doing this one thing,
and no one else is even trying to do it. Within a few
years the America of our fathers will either be saved or
lost, and unless some other way is found, all who wish
to see it saved must work with us. """,2015-11-17 14:53:25+00:00,cx3ayxr,1.0,t3_3t5jjt,5725.0,politics

11345,"You don't even know what a fact is.  Seriously you have a lot to learn.  Start with the differences between fact, opinion and belief

A fact is verifiable. We can determine whether it is true by researching the evidence. This may involve numbers, dates, testimony, etc. (Ex.: ""World War II ended in 1945."") The truth of the fact is beyond argument if one can assume that measuring devices or records or memories are correct. Facts provide crucial support for the assertion of an argument. However, facts by themselves are worthless unless we put them in context, draw conclusions, and, thus, give them meaning. 

An opinion is a judgment based on facts, an honest attempt to draw a reasonable conclusion from factual evidence. (For example, we know that millions of people go without proper medical care, and so you form the opinion that the country should institute national health insurance even though it would cost billions of dollars.) An opinion is potentially changeable--depending on how the evidence is interpreted. By themselves, opinions have little power to convince. You must always let your reader know what your evidence is and how it led you to arrive at your opinion. 

Unlike an opinion, a belief is a conviction based on cultural or personal faith, morality, or values. Statements such as ""Capital punishment is legalized murder"" are often called ""opinions"" because they express viewpoints, but they are not based on facts or other evidence. They cannot be disproved or even contested in a rational or logical manner. Since beliefs are inarguable, they cannot serve as the thesis of a formal argument. (Emotional appeals can, of course, be useful if you happen to know that your audience shares those beliefs.) 

Another kind of assertion that has no place in serious argumentation is prejudice, a half-baked opinion based on insufficient or unexamined evidence. (Ex.: ""Women are bad drivers."") Unlike a belief, a prejudice is testable: it can be contested and disproved on the basis of facts. We often form prejudices or accept them from others--family, friends, the media, etc.--without questioning their meaning or testing their truth. At best, prejudices are careless oversimplifications. At worst, they reflect a narrow-minded view of the world. Most of all, they are not likely to win the confidence or agreement of your readers.
