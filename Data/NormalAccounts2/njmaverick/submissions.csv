Dear Mr. Trump, 

Relax, you're golden. I'm about to hand you the presidency on a silver platter. I'm releasing a statement to stir things up re: Hillary's emails again, even though it has nothing to do with her emails. Just try not to sexually assault anyone else between now and November 8 and the White House is yours. All glory to Mother Russia! MAGA! 

Your faithful servant,

Now mind you, one needs to forget that many of these tweets were made at 1 or 2 or 4 in the morning (is this donald trump by any chance?)

I reviewed the account supposedly belonging to Juanita Broaddrick and the one that account alleges is Juanita's 13 year old grand son and neither passes the smell test.  Both are anti-Hillary, pro-trump, anti-liberal/democrat and racist.  Both accounts push Alt-Right memes as well.   They are just your typical alt-right accounts of the deplorables.   You can see the tweets.

Unlike Hillary... Trump cares about our military and won't abandon troops in a place like Benghazi.

The MSM has been on the attack against her smearing her with one fake scandal after another.   In addition, the weaselly Republican head of the FBI dredged up his ""Hillary is innocent but I don't like her scandal"" a third time by taking the unprecedented step of releasing investigation notes to the public (which interestingly enough show the only liar in all this is Comey).   I digress, though this is about how to combat or mitigate the MSM's efforts to give the election to Donald Trump (sort of like what Putin is trying to do).

The thing is much of the MSM coverage is also available online and no doubt these agencies monitor clicks into various articles.    So when you see bad press about Donald or positive coverage of Hillary be sure to click  those articles.  Let the MSM see that doing their jobs correctly as journalists can be as profitable as being in the tank for Donald Trump. 

By the same token it's probably a good idea to limit how many smear Hillary articles or Donald really isn't a racist madman articles you visit.

You take in his appearance and speech mannerisms and they all play into that easy to understand narrative.   Bernie's own lack of depth for his positions would further amplify this attack.  In the end it can be as devastating as the attacks on Marco that he was a talking suit who was incapable of straying from his pre-written talking points.  

One of the points made in support of Bernie is that he polls well against the potential Republican opponents.   That is a very misleading point because Bernie has not been tested or challenged to date.   Look at Ben Carson he was riding high until people got a closer look at him and what he believed in.

Bernie is the same way.   Bernie has faced Hillary's love taps and a GOP that has been indifferent toward him.  If by some miracle Bernie won the nomination you can bet the bank they would use their billions in bribe money and their control of the media to rip Bernie to shreds.

You wouldn't be able to turn on a radio or tune in a TV station or visit a website and not hear some GOP soldier talking about ""Sanders the fantasists waging war on reality"".    Plus they will throw in the old Joe the Plumber attacks claiming Bernie wants to take your hard earned money and give it to the lazy poor people (with minority implied, unless it's Trump running and then it will be said outright).

Just remember this:

The President pro tempore (a Senator elected to the post by the Senate at the beginning of each Congress, which since World War II by custom has been the most senior Senator of the majority party) is nominally responsible for presiding over the Senate **""in the Absence of the Vice President**, or when he shall exercise the Office of the President of the United States"" (Article I, Section 3, Clause 5). More typically, junior senators of the majority party designated by the President pro tempore preside over the chamber.

1. Powerful and Continuing Nationalism - ""Make America Great Again!""
 
2. Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights - Donald's open sanctioning of torture
 
3. Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause - Muslims or Mexicans take your pick.
 
4. Supremacy of the Military -  N/A
 
5. Rampant Sexism - Donald's sexism is a matter of public record
 
6. Controlled Mass Media - Donald is advocating being able to sue any media outlet that writes something bad about him.
 
7. Obsession with National Security - Donald has played the terrorism card over and over again.
 
8. Religion and Government are Intertwined - Donald frequently questions the faith of his opponents and has even had a fight with the Pope over faith.
 
9. Corporate Power is Protected - One look at Donald's economic plans will show you that.
 
10. Labor Power is Suppressed - Donald favors taking down the unions.
 
11. Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts - In fairness Donald shows a lot of disdain these are just among them
 
12. Obsession with Crime and Punishment - A major part of his campaign

I label statements that politifact labels as false or ""pants on fire"" as lies and those statements listed as true or mostly true as the truth.

REPUBLICANS  (top 4 candidates)

Donald Trump:  Lies 63% of the time;  tells the truth 7% of the time

Ben Carson:  Lies 59% of the time; tells the truth 4% of the time

Marco Rubio: Lies 18% of the time;  tells the truth 38% of the time

Hillary Clinton:  Lies 12% of the time; tells the truth 50% of the time

Bernie Sanders:  Lies 14% of the time;  Tells the truth 54% of the time
