I can't remember the name of the act off the top of my head, but there was an act passed by politicians that told banks to give out more loans to subprime borrowers, and the government would back them up in case of default. Banks did, but some bankers did lie and say they were prime lenders when they bundled these loans into a financial tool. That's on bankers. But the act and giving out the loans is primarily on politicians while a lot of the foreclosures are on the people themselves. There are stories of cleaning ladies taking out a mortgage that costs them 25-30k per year when they earn 30k per year. Clearly they wouldn't be able to pay it off, but when it reached that point, people tend to prefer to point fingers.

There's also more to it with hedge funds knowing about these financial tools and banks getting into them when they didn't have sufficient knowledge about them, so losing a lot of money there, but that money lost was from mortgage payments (mortgage backed securities).
