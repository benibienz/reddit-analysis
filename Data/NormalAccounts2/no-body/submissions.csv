No one is talking policies, investigations (on both sides), foreign policy, cabinets, supreme court, etc. you know, the things that matter about the president. Instead it is all identity politics. lots of things like, ""Uneducated, oppressive, white America wins again. I truly wish I had the white male privilege to vote third party and not have to worry about my rights being taken away."" That does nobody any good, and doesn't add anything to the discussion other than make you look like an uninformed person who only cares about ""oppresion points"". 

There is more to this election than that. There are things like the upcoming recession (most forecasts call for one in 2-3 years), the low labor force participation, the medical cost inflation, our foreign policy, etc. So if you don't want to focus on the important things, like what the next 4 years will change in terms of how it will actually this great country, kindly either learn about about how our political system ACTUALLY works (and how hard it is to actually remove some of these rights you are so worried about losing).

This got me thinking quite a bit about Wikileaks and CTR. I realized that the leaks and CTR are an attempted move from a democratic system towards a totalitarian. There are active plans to suppress votes, silence critics and opponents, and silence voices. 

That being said, I am curious on your opinions of this? After all, mao, Stalin, and Hitler were all totalitarians...",The_Donald,Learning about political systems,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/59qgwz/learning_about_political_systems/

Just woke up, so obligatory edit: Wow, thank you everyone! So It seems like I should start with Kanthal 26ga(may do 24g, as I use .2 or .3 ohm coils on my tanks) and maybe [this](http://www.wotofo.com/wotofo-the-troll-rda-v2.html) as a starting point, and thank you /u/OneBrownBear for [this](http://i.imgur.com/1qByykM.png) guide on sizing and all of that. I guess my main remaining question is where would I get the tools to make the coils/attach the coils (like the different mm thickness screwdrivers)?

So I guess, given the tanks, and the fact I have BVC replacements for the nautilus tanks that are 1.8W instead of 1.6W, any battery recommendations? Hoping for a high capacity VV battery with a range of 3.3V-5.0 or 6.0V (for the replacement BVCs) that's not too pricey.

Edit: edit just because, I started using e cigs a few years back with the blue cartridges and rechargeable packs, then moved to njoy, and am now here.
