Aside from that, everything I have ever read has said that modafinil doesn't build tolerance. However in my own experience, it has slowly become less and less effective. Sometimes it works as expected, others I find myself nodding off only 4-5 hours after taking it and feel it has no effect at all. I do not take it daily but rather 2-3 times a week. As you said, taking a long break seems to make little to no difference.

I feel for you. I am male/23/single. I am very successful in my life and have the money to support myself and buy all the toys/things I want. Yet being lonely, has been slowly killing me. I have friends, but I never let them in. I don't let anybody in. I don't trust people.

At least you think your attractive. I have never felt that way. I have always been told by every1 how good looking I am but I just don't see it and have always assumed they are trying to be nice or pitty me. The only time people have ever said otherwise was when they were really mad at me, which also throws any validity to their statements out as those comments are made with the intent to hurt.

I personally believe that we are our own perception. I have horrible self image, and therefore I act in a way that is reactive to that. You see yourself as fucked up, so its hard for you to do the things you want to be happy, because you see yourself as fucked up and unable to be happy.

It's all really a paradox. I want a girlfriend because I don't want to be lonely. I dont want a girlfriend because (insert random excuse based on self perception or irrational external perceived issue). And that's just it, excuses as to why I cant be happy. Because I am not ""like every1 else"" in my eyes.

At the end of the day I default to negativity because it's what I know best. I fear the unknown. I don't trust other people. I have horrible self image. I know all of these problems and I see them clearly, yet I am powerless over them.

31,"While I can respect that opinion and how optimistic you are. I just don't feel the same way. And please don't take this as an agressive post, I am not attacking you, just the idea that we have a lot of time.

I live by myself, so I have to do everything for myself. Lets look at an average day and how much time I have to do stuff. Say I leave work at 5 pm, get home at ~5:30. If I want any reasonable amount of sleep I have to go to bed by 9 pm so I can get up at 6:30 the next day. So already I am left with 3.5 hours from the time I get home. From here if I choose to feed myself that would include prepping, eating, cleaning ~1-1.5 hours gone. So now I have 2 hours left. So as anybody knows, having your own place leaves you with a long list of to-do's. Also living by myself, I have nobody to split of house work with. So basically I either try to keep up with feeding myself, and doing shopping, taking time to go through bills, work on my truck/motorcycle/dirtbike/moutain bike/snowmobile, clean my house/fix stuff, etc. let alone try to enjoy any of those things.

This was barely managable during the summer, when I would come home at 5:30 and still have the sun until 9pm. Now thanks to daylights savings, it is pitch black when I leave work at 5, and cold as fuck. So basically anything I have to get done that involves sunlight now happens on the weekends, further reducing my time to be effective, and reducing time to enjoy myself.

I keep trying to squeeze a gym membership/time in here but I am just not seeing it. I could get up earlier, but to maintain a decent amount of sleep, that will require me to go to bed earlier, so regaurdless the Gym will eat at least 1 hour of my 3.5 hours.

Another thing to take into account here is stress. Where is the time to relax and not stress about things/wind down from work. I mean when laundry/cleaning/housework is backed up, and doing it means not eating and not relaxing, and I have things I need to fix on my vehicle, it all adds up and snowballs.

You may be greatful to have weekends + holidays, but they are nothing more than extra catch up time from stuff I didnt do during the week. (which most of the time I dont even feed myself because the entire effort takes too much time)

So I see where OP is comming from. And the statement ""Now i get to spend 5/7 of my life doing a job to just pay for the food and then I get two days (+ holidays) to do whatever it is i love. Time that no one should really have. "" Just isn't true because you have ""work"" to do outside of work, so how much time do you really have?

So far my approach is to get what I can done, and on the weekends take modafinil and basically get 3 hours of sleep each night, when all I really want to do is sleep in because I am so overworked.",2015-11-25 18:46:07+00:00,cxcuvcz,4,t1_cxcty6n,1354,StackAdvice

Of course I don't mean this with a negative connotation, so please dont take it that way. But I don't think there will be much info for your given dose because I am pretty sure nobody has ever studied such high consumption in a lab setting. I could be wrong, but it seems highly unlikely since the effective dose is so low, and most studies are related to tea, that is even in such low quantities, it makes our 100mg doses look like mega doses.

Also please be aware of your source, because taking something in that high quantity, your going to want the highest grade lab-tested supplement you can get. Heavy metals and other processing contaminents may be in low concentration and not of much concern at the typical 100mg dose, but in excess of 10g a day, you may be getting a lot more of those nasties if your source isn't really good. This is a problem often observed with piracetam since the effective dose is so high.

Also 1 kilo = 1000g = /10g a day = 100 days, €140/100 = €1.40/day which I guess doesnt seem that expensive, but its more expensive than modafinil which I already felt was a bit pricy but I guess thats opinion based.

There is no proof of this so far, and anything you read is purely anecdotal/speculation, or based on animal studies (not humans). Though given that your body/liver needs to process it, it is entirely possible.

Having taken both of the substances you mentioned, I can say that I really like afinils for mental stimulation and general wakefulness, and Phenylpiracetam for physically demanding tasks. PP is actually a band substance in many competitive sports because of its documented ability to extend physical endurance.

You do not need choline with either of these. My personal opinion is to try them both and figure out which one works best for you. But before you do that, do your research and make your own risk assesment. Its your body, know what your putting in it, not just what others tell you.

49,"I guess I should also add that you seem to be overanalizing this. 

&gt;research has also showed me that the feelings I'm getting are typical of liver/gallbladder/kidney complications—as many of us know, adrafinil is touted for raising liver enzymes, hence producing liver issues.

A perfect example. Since the liver effects of Adrafinil are still anecdotal or mice studies, it carries little weight. I will also point out that liver problems take a long time to manefest, and slightly raised enzymes (if adrafinil does in fact do that) are going to take a long time to hurt you in any significant way.

Also per the usual, if your experiencing adverse reactions to a medication, stop taking it, if it goes away, great, dont take that med anymore, if not, see a doctor.",2015-11-16 20:45:59+00:00,cx2gsse,2,t1_cx2gii0,404,Nootropics
50,"adrafinil, your experiencing histamine my friend. Modafinil is very well documented for raising histamine levels.

When I take modafinil, I get it a little bit. But if I take modafinil for more than 2 days in a row, it builds up really bad and I get really itchy skin and soar throat. Armodafinil is not as strong as Modafinil for me, but does not give me these sides anywhere near as bad. Since Adrafinil is a prodrug for both, you may not have the luxury I do of taking the one with lesser sides.

I would reccomend taking an antihistamine to see if that helps at all. I have a condition called dermatographia, which is like a non-stop histamine reaction all over my body and gets really bad if I get scratched, or even if something lightly rubs my skin. So I am very familiar with the effect profile of histamines, and take an antihistamine(Zyrtec) daily. Even with my antihistamine, I get the skin sides from mod/rmod. As I said it only gets bad after a few days of continuous use, so I only use armod every once in a while because it helps a LOT with the drowsyness I get from the aformentioned zyrtec.",2015-11-16 20:39:15+00:00,cx2gii0,1,t3_3t2929,1521,Nootropics

Implies that once you conciously observe your shallower breathing, you become worried, which increases anxiety and leads to a shortness of breath feeling.

I used to get really bad anxiety and would freak out about shortness of breath, gasping for air as if I couldn't get enough.

However, what really happens, and you will read this in a lot of articles on reduction of anxiety and fighting off panic attacks, is that to reduce anxiety, you have to slow down your breathing. Breath slower, shallower, and more controlled. As it just so happens, you body knows this, which is why you breath shallow, and experience a shortness of breath feeling.

Again could be caused by histamine. But as with all medications, and as the other poster said. Any adverse reaction should warrant a complete stopping of the medication, and after several days is symptoms worsen or do not improve, see a doctor.

These reactions are pretty common with modafinil no matter how many ""it didnt happen to me"" naysayers there are around here. They are side effects, not everybody experiences them but a signifigant enough % of people experience them that they are listed on reputable drug/medical websites.

I get these side effects from modafinil, but not from armoda. However moda has a much stronger effect on me than armoda so I prefer taking it, but I use armoda most of the time and on occasional days when I want stronger effects I cycle in 1 or 2 days of moda.

It was tough at first with no medications, but slowly I was able to fight my way out of panic attacks, and eventually prevent myself from going into them in the first place.

I still carried a ton of anxiety around with me, and the nootropics have helped significantly in reducing that to a point where I hardly experience any anxiety at all anymore.

74,"Well it depends on what im looking for. Caffine always has spiked my anxiety and made me feel bad. No other stimulant has had these effects, so I only use caffine 2-4 times a week and max out at 1 coffee a day. However I typically mix theanine into my coffee and feel great.

However, on days when I just want to feel at peace without being tired I will take theanine by itself.

Here is a little write up I did on theanine a while back : https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/3fvk0v/ltheanine_oral_vs_sublingual_experience/

Honestly though, if you experience a high level of anxiety, you should avoid all stimulants until you get your anxiety under some sort of control. I was able to do this with theanine by itself. Using it on a daily basis for a couple of weeks kept me in a nice peaceful state like a benzo, without feeling high or drowsy. I was functional, yet all of my anxieties melted away. And any feelings of anxiety that came up were easy to shrug off. Once I had a good reference point, it has made dealing with anxiety much easier for me, and I was able to start adding stimulants back into the mix.

Another amazing nootropic I have found is L-tyrosine. It can't really be used long term because it will slowly deplete other necissary components for dopamine production. However, using 500mg daily for about 2 weeks, then 1 week off, has been a good cycle for me. The first day it doesnt do much, but the second day and all days after, I feel really good, and anxiety free. It is hard to explain, but I can easily do things I need/want to do around my house and at work and not be crippled by anxiety. Just the relief from continuous stress I think leaves me with a lot more energy than I used to have and I can actually do things. Plus the major thing for me is the fact that I just feel good. Not like a high or euphoria or anything, its actually hard to describe, I just feel good. I have felt bad/stressed/depressed for so long that this relief just feels liberating in a way.

I say take it slow, start with theanine for a couple weeks. Don't overwhelm yourself and your body with a bunch of new substances. Take time to relax, and focus on how it feels and how wonderful it would be to be that relaxed all the time. It will build up over time and you will overcome your anxiety eventually. You may never get rid of it, but you can at least gain some power over it and it brings a lot of comfort knowing you can actually do something about it instead of being helpless.

L-theanine provides great effects for anxiety reduction, and is as safe as it gets. Stick with that. Caffine is a good stimulant, piracetam is an oldie and a goody for nootropic effects, and choline will supplement the piracetam.

You have been taking something like dex long enough that the sides are wearing on you. This means you have built enough of a tolerance that most of the effects have become part of your baseline. Therefore, those powerful effects are no longer noticed as much as the sides, which to you, don't seem normal.

I have experienced a lot of stimulants, and I can honestly say the afinils 100% give the same focus/motivation effect, though not to the same level, as something like adderall. The difference being, I know my baseline, and can judge effects much more efficiently.

TLDR, You ARE feeling the effects. The problem is that they are not as strong, or are only equal to, your baseline you have developed on dex.

184,"Sounds like a run-of-the-mill panic attack to me. Caffine and stimulants cause anxiety, if you are a person who has a lot of stress in your life, or have a lot of anxiety, this is pretty normal and the addes stress/anxiety from stimulants can send you over the edge. Anxiety can cause heart palpatations, hypertension, and chest pain. (symptoms of a heart attack, and once you start thinking about it you can self-cause arm numbness/pain)

The power of the mind is... usually much more than we think it is. This is why we can experience placebo effects. I used to have really bad anxiety and panic attacks that came with all the symptoms of a heart attack. The reality is that when going into a panic attack, your body goes into fight or flight mode, releases adrenaline, and makes those ""feeling of a heart attack symptoms"" much worse.

So it is very possible that you are experiencing anxiety (caffine increases anxiety a lot), that causes chest/arm pains, that leads to a panic attack which just compounds all of the things you were already feeling. I believe this to be the case especially because of your test results comming back fine and the general worriedness in your post.

Do research. Everything, even the old and very studied substances like piracetam are still experimental substances. Inform yourself before putting things in your body.

You have a very difficult situation. Best thing to help with ADHD is stimulants. The worst thing for anxiety is.... stimulants. So either you are going to calm yourself more, or get yourself focusing on the things you need to but increase anxiety. If your anything like me a lot of my anxiety comes from having a lot to do, but no motivation/will power to actually do it so it continues to pile up.

I would reccomend piracetam, l-theanine + caffine, maybe noopept or semax.

However I think that if you dont already, try exercising at least once a day, it will help a lot with the anxiety. And if you get the anxiety managable maybe you can start dabbling in some stimulants for the ADHD.

Yeah I keep getting that same opinion everywhere, that an 800 is a much better choice, especially since I will be rippin across the lake most of the time. I was looking into yamaha nytro 1050cc sleds, but I think the 4 stroke will still be underwhelming. I want something that is begging to be opened up and acts like an untamed animal when it is. 

So a 2-stroke just makes the most sense. And an 800 does as well to drive the point home. I want something with good handleing so that untamed animal can be pushed around, and it seems every1 is saying ski-doo. Its just a shame that the best option, is also the one with the biggest potential issues &gt;.&gt;

I do have horrible sleep patterns, sometimes sleeping 2-3 hours in a night, yet sometimes I can sleep for well over 12 hours. Since starting a 9-5 job I have been on the side of 2-5 hours. I know that sleep is good and all, but I just don't have enough time outside of work to do all the things I want to so I stay up late(usually working on my 3d printer).

Another thing that concerns me is that most noots have some influence on mood and, well, ""Bipolar II (very important not to go to far on mood enhancement or I'll go hypomanic)"". Most noots are experimental, and there is no telling what effects your going to experience since they vary so much from person to person.

I have had great success with nootropics/drugs that interacted with GABA and I never knew why. This article just bridged a major gap in my understanding of whats going on in my head. I know its still early in the experiment and study of these mechanisms, but I can relate to their findings. I have always had really strange sleep patterns as well.

So still on topic, I have been trying L-theanine this week for the first time. I have been taking 200mg (weighed on 0.01 scale) orally in OO caps, with ~100mg of caffine in the form of guarana each morning. The first morning I felt REALLY WEIRD.

This could be scewed a bit though, as I quick smoking weed last wednesday and its the longest I have gone without smoking in over 2 years.

I also wonder if this GABA/histamine production center in the brain could be responcible for some of the reports of people getting itchy from taking theanine.

275,"""I was mostly excited about pairing theanine and caffeine, as I'm a drowsy, brain-fogged individual who gets a severe panic attack whenever I drink coffee. Real cool practical joke, God.""

I have had a lot of ups and downs with anxiety/panic attacks and stimulants. Most notably coffee. I used to get horrible anxiety that would keep me on the edge of a panic attack for 3-4 hours after drinking coffee.

I assume, having a panic disorder, that you have some experience with benzo's. I don't like xanax because it either does nothing, makes my anxiety worse, or just outright knocks me out. I have tried some of the other Benzo's, but the one that helped me the most was clonazepam. Of course you have to stay concious of the addictive qualities of benzos, and the potential withdrawal effects. So tread lightly. But I would say that after taking clonazepam 1-2 times a week for a few months, it became much easier for me to fight off panic attacks, and in general avoid them to begin with.

I will explain a bit (I will use xanax as the example benzo as most of them have a similar short-acting effect/time curve):
While xanax will help in the event of a panic attack, it doesn't do much about preventing them. It comes on strong, does what its supposed to, and leaves you high and dry a few hours later to the next day. Clonazepam (klonopin) has a long-acting effect. So in the event of a panic attack, it will help, but its going to take a good hour or so to help (unless your like me and the simple act of taking it is enough to calm you down for a bit until it takes effect. Because you know you will be able to come out of a bad panic attack at that point). The real magic is the way it acts, and how long it lasts. So if you find yourself in a stressful situation, you can take one and stop the panic attack from ever starting in the first place. However, you also have to know that you will be extremely relaxed for hours, most likekely the whole rest of the day. And not be able to get much done. However being in that relaxed state for such a long time, you can kinda get used to it and teach yourself how it feels to be so relaxed. So after a few months of using it as little as I could. I found that I didn't need it anymore because I knew how it felt to be so relaxed and was able to put myself into that relaxed state. 

I became so good at it that eventually I started putting coffee back into my daily routine. However after a while you do build a tolerance to caffine and it started to cause me anxiety again. I did some research and found guarana. Guarana has more caffine than coffee, but I found that in pill/extract form, guarana is more of an extended release. I will normally crash after 4-5 hours of drinking a coffee, but taking 1 guarana pill will last me 8-9 hours, and the onset is so slow and subtle that i don't get any of the anxiety I get from coffee. So if you like the effects of coffee, but not the fast/heavy onset, I would reccomend giving guarana a try. But I would address some of your anxiety issues first, as that is probably one of the main causes of the fog/drowsyness you describe (anxiety is very mentally and physically draining on your body/mind).",2015-07-28 15:50:55+00:00,ctj35oa,1,t3_3ewkf7,3562,Nootropics

What people recognize, yet fail to take into consideration, is how powerful LSD is. It's power is what enables microdosing to be effective, but at the same time is why it should be respected.

Also if you want to know a lot about Psilocin/Psilocybin (IIRC Psilocin is the active chemical, Psilocybin is converted to Psilocin by the body), go check out the shroomery forums. There is more than you could ever want to know about it there.

289,"You can microdose shrooms, although not as precisely as LSD, which also is not precise unless done correctly (i.e. not blotters, gummies, etc.)

I have had a lot of shroom/LSD experience and I have had quite a few bad LSD trips.

Main difference IMHO is that LSD puts you in the drivers seat of a ferrari and lets you just do what you want. Therefor you can get yourself into trouble a lot easier. But also you can keep yourself out of trouble as well because you have control.

Shrooms is like an amusement park ride. Your along for the ride, and if you dont like it, well tough shit. I learned very early on with mushrooms that your being brought for a ride, and you have to go with it. Once you try to fight it, your going to spiral out of control trying to fight something that you have no control over.

For me also, I prefer to either micro-dose or take larger amounts. A minimum of 2-3 grams. If you take less, you will still have a stong enough basis in reality to think you have some sort of control, and you will have a bad time much easier.

The best/most vivid experience I ever had on shrooms, I knew 10 mins after drinking the tea that I was fucked. I immediately told myself to let go of any concept of reality and from here on out anything that happened was not real. It was amazing. The girl I was with however, kept looking at her phone and things she knew to be real (trying to base her perception of reality on something known to be good). I kept trying to convince her to let go of reality but she wouldn't and I tripped out so I couldnt advise her any longer. She ended up having the worst trip of her life, she left my place like 30 mins into it and cried the whole time at another friends house.

The point being, with shrooms, you have to let go completely. Once you do, you won't have a bad trip.",2015-07-24 17:18:33+00:00,cteryki,2,t1_cterbb2,928,Nootropics

Half a day to a day to work up to it, a whole day dedicated to the trip with no responcibilities, and a whole day after (the most important part) to think through everything that happened and get my head straight again. It is really important to be in the right environment and with no stress/obligations that would be mentally demanding.

The randomness was very close, but the speed at which my mind was racing seemed faster. I find that when tripping you go into more of a deep thought. At leas I tend to process thoughts a lot more and try to make sense of them. I couldn't do any of that. Its like I had the loss of a filter that you get when your tripping, but no ability to think through any of my thoughts before the next one raced into my head. All I could do is try to focus on walking and distract myself from the racing thoughts.

And whenever I get that type of thing when I am tripping, I can calm myself down because I know why its happening. This was completely different because I was not sure why everything went so wrong.",2015-07-23 02:19:26+00:00,ctcwcov,2,t1_ctcvhh3,1521,Nootropics

293,"I can feel you on the 6 year thing. I know that the daily smoker is the one who feels the negative side effects the worst. And that's is a combination of over indulgence combined with high tolerance.

The thing I have learned from being a regular smoker for such a long time (&gt;8 years), is that once you build tolerance, you lose enjoyment even with increased consumption. And as I said earlier, a consumer of marijuana products will gain tolerance to the different active chemicals/cannabinoids at different rates, and they will go down at different rates. But the fact remains, as with all drugs, that once you have an expectancy of what being high on a given substance is like, it looses a lot of its ""magic"". Making it as routine as smoking every day only exaggerates that problem.

Now back to the tolerance thing. Different strains contain different ratios of active components. The person who gains a tolerance to CBDs will become more susceptible to the anxiety effect of THC. The opposite is also true in that a person that builds tolerance faster to THC will feel the relaxing/depressing effects of the CBDs more.

This can be controlled by strain, but is also very dependent on how each persons biological makeup determines their tolerance building. I have found a sweet spot and I should have mentioned in my original post that I actually do enjoy consuming cannabis now. I have found the ""sweet spot"" of moderation where I dont get the anxiety/depression/negative effects, yet I dont get the first time smoker blasted to space every time I smoke. 

I think that cannabis has a very unique synergy in that its different active components cancel each others negative effects, and that's why almost everybody enjoys it when they first start, but after a few years and tolerance building, they lose that enjoyment and start to see the negative effects. I also think that some people who can't enjoy/handle it from the first time they try it, simply react much stronger to some components then others. This also lends itself to the whole idea that each person experiences their own high and effects from cannabis. Because there ARE so man ACTIVE components and they act on a lot of different mechanisms in the brain and body.

I actually made a rather lengthy post on the shroomery about how some people can ""lose"" their marijuana (i.e. lose the ability to get enjoyment out of it, and start experiencing depression/anxiety from it) and why that happens and how to get it back. I have smoked consistantly over the past year without much problems because I learned how to moderate its use. The general idea behind it is that weed has a LOT of active chemicals/cannabinoids and your tolerance to each of these builds at a different rate. So for some people the sedating effect wears off faster than the stimulating effect, thus causing anxiety/panic/depression.
