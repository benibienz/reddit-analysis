I am at a crossroads. I currently own a 2005 Dodge Ram 1500 with the 5.7 Hemi. I just hit 100k miles and the truck as a whole seems to be deteriorating at a very rapid rate:
- engine ticking(has always had the ""Hemi tick"", but has gotten much worse suddenly)
- leaking rear end
- rust poking through paint on quarter panels
- goes through about 1 quart of oil every 1k miles (apparently normal according to dodge)
- all the shocks are pretty much blown/shot
- cruise control no longer works due to some unknown electrical issues
- the list goes on.....

Not to say the truck doesn't have pros, its really fast and drives more like a muscle car than a truck, has that sweet Hemi sound, and towing performance always exceeds my expectations. However I commute about an hour round trip at 55 mph a day, and the Hemi demands 89 octane which really sucks when I only average 14 mpg.

I have been doing a ton of research to figure out if a diesel makes sense for me or not. I haul snowmobiles every weekend during the winter, but thats the only regular towing I do. I think my biggest motivation is the fact I have always wanted a turbo diesel, and I want something that is going to hold value better than my dodge has.

So what it really comes down to is whether or not to start sinking a bunch of money into my Dodge, or to trade it in for something else. I still owe ~$4500 on my truck and I am looking at $6.5-$7.5k trade in, or $8k+ private sale for my truck.

I have been looking around and have found a few 2005-2008 ish GMC 2500HD trucks for around the ~$20k-$25k range. One in particular at a dealership down the road is a 2007 GMC Sierra 2500HD Classic SLE1, with 120k miles, the LBZ engine, and is very clean/bone stock with the exception of rims. They are only asking $25999 which seems like a good deal to me but  know there's a lot to check into like injectors/etc.

Sorry for this being so long but I wanted to paint the full picture. Anybody have any comments/advice? I am pretty much set on duramax if I make the switch. I don't like ford trucks, and Dodge makes great engines no doubt, but the rest of the truck has been leaving a bad taste in my mouth recently.

Thanks for reading/your time!

I will start off by saying that I had desired effects 1 time so far. I took 2 sprays, 1 in each nostril, and then consumed some hash oil immediately after. I got extremely focused and felt great for at least a few hours, and tapered down to normal over 4 hours total.

However I have taken 2 sprays in the same way with the following things: by itself, with piracetam, with l-theanine, with modafinil, with phenylpiracetam, and with caffine.

Every other way I have taken it, especially by itself, it has the same effects. I get a strong comming on feeling, I get really intensely focused and feel a pressure in my head, and it lasts for about 30 mins. Then after the 30 mins I get a strong comming down off adderall type of feeling, and the pressure in my head remains. I then get pretty lethargic and eventually end up passing out/sleeping for 2-3 hours and then wake up feeling weird and with a weird headache until I go to bed for good. This has happended in this exact order around 8 times or so now (every time I have taken it except the time with the hash oil).

Has anybody else experienced anything similar? I have read a couple similar anecdotes here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/2f41dd/noopept_making_me_sleepy_and_drowsy/

and here: https://www.reddit.com/r/StackAdvice/comments/1xe1su/noopept_making_me_sleepy_no_effect_from_piracetam/

It seems that other people have had these same effects, and it seems to be associated with dosing too high? When I use the nasal spray, I inhale slowly to get all the mist into my sinuses which works really well and I can feel it in there. But 2 sprays should only be ~3mg since 1 spray is 1.5mg which doesnt seem like a lot. Does anybody know why this happens or what they have done to avoid it?

However I still noticed I was hungy the whole time. All 3 doses were taken with food, not on empty stomach, and with no other substances.

I have been shopping/saving since the start of last season. I decided to hold off and save more to get a quality sled, so I just rented/borrowed sleds last year. I have never owned one, but I have raced dirtbikes my whole life, and started on a 1000cc crotch rocket for my first motorcycle without problems. I picked up snowmobiling pretty rapidly so I don't want to hear the ""start out smaller"" speil. I am 24, 6'3"", and 240 lbs so I typically fit better on bigger things.

I really like the idea of a 137 over a 129, I know I want a 2-stroke, and the 2 brands that I gravitate towards are Arctic Cat and Ski-Doo. I would love a Yamaha if they made a 2 stroke (my buddy has a 2002 SX VIPER thats a BLAST), but they don't and I am only interested in stuff ~2008 or newer. 

So I am kinda torn between a 2010-11 crossfire 800, renegade 600, or MXZ (600cc) or 500ss (still 600cc) (since I hear awful things about BRP 800 motors...). I see those seem to fall in the $4500-6000 price range which is basically where I am looking. I am tempted to just put a large down payment on a brand new AC ZR 6000 or Doo Renegade etec 600, but I don't exactly have a trailer or anything (just a standard bed 1500 truck, no garage) . So I am not sure if it would be wise to put say ~$4000 down on a brand new ride, and then use my leftover money for a covered trailer. Regardless it is looking like ~$6000 will be the budget ceiling before the end of October and how much I spend on used will determine what I could spend on a trailer for storage/transportation.

The other thing is, and I saw this asked somewhere else, how would you go about testing a sled in the summer. I understand starting it, and maybe lifting the track, but other than that it seems pretty difficult to determine if it has any crash symptoms. Mileage has been scaring me away from some as well. I figure &lt;3k miles is a good place to start, though those miles don't mean much if it was ridden on mostly mountain or really hard for instance.

My intended riding style is trails, and I live in the lakes region of NH so there will be a LOT of lake riding (why I want something fast). What are your thoughts on my decision, and any other considerations I may be overlooking?

17,2015-08-05 14:00:16+00:00,self.Nootropics,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/3fvk0v/ltheanine_oral_vs_sublingual_experience/,,"So over the course of the past 2 weeks I have been giving L-theanine a try. I typically have a lot of anxiety, lack of motivation/depression, and recently a slight dependancy on caffine.

I typically take 100-200mg of caffine a day in  the form of guarana because it lasts 8-9 hours and has a nice gentle onset throughout the day. Compared to coffee which tends to hit me all at once, and then taper off after 2 hours leaving me exhausted and full of anxiety.

**L-theanine Oral:** I got L-theanine in powder form (liftmode), weighed out 200mg (+- 15mg) on my scale (0.01g accuracy) and put that in OOsized capsules. 

**L-theanine Sublingual:** I got L-theanine in sublingual solution form (Ceretropic). The recommended dose is 0.5ml = 100mg

**Powder Theanine mixed in coffee** - The first day I got a medium sized coffee and dumped out one of my 200mg capsules into it and stirred it in. I drank the coffee over a period of about an hour and started feeling the effects of the caffine, but with some sort of strange feeling. I got a lot done that day and generally enjoyed the way I felt. I was energetic, yet clear headed. The coffee eventually wore off and I started to feel the anxiety I get after drinking coffee and felt kinda strange for the rest of the day, but still more productive than usual.

**Oral Theanine + Guarana (~200mg caffine)** - On the second day, I liked the synergy of the 2 (theanine + caffine), but disliked the typical coffee downsides I have observed in the past, so I switched to my normal guarana pills. This time I just took the 200mg theanine OO cap orally, took  a shower, then took the guarana pill. I had MUCH STONGER effects this time. About half way through the shower I started having waves of some undescribably weird feeling flowing up and down my body. I felt pretty light headed, and slightly nauseous. By the time I got out of the shower I was feeling slightly impaired and was having a hard time focusing on anything. I then took the caffine to see if it would level me out. It didn't. It just made things worse and I had to drive to work. When I got to work ~1hour after taking the first pill, I still felt really weird, light headed, impaired. After focusing on some stuff at work for about an hour, these feelings tapered off and I started to feel really productive. The closest thing I can compare it to was Adderall. I felt like I had a massive surplus of energy, but with a clear head unlike adderall. I for the most part enjoyed my day, but kept getting large waves of anxiety.

The next day, I decided that I needed to reduce the caffine because of the anxiety, so I chopped my guarana pill in half (~100mg caffine) and took it at the same time as 200mg of the theanine. This was a great combo, I didn't have any intoxicating effects anymore, and I also read about how theanine makes people feel weird the first time they take it. Which i can 100% confirm, and almost wonder if the first dose I took (mixed with coffee) just didn't get into my system very much, or was overpowered by the strong onset of caffine in coffee. Anyways the 200mg theanine : 100mg caffine was a really good combo and I did it for 3 days, but I still kept getting some anxiety so I decided to cut the caffine.

**200mg L-theanine in powder orally** - This, is what I found to be wonderful. I found this to give me a boost because it made my head really clear, yet relaxed my body and severely lowered my anxiety. This lowered anxiety and clear head allowed me to focus on work (Software engineer) in a way that I havent done before. I liked it so much I ordered sublingual drops from Ceretropic so that I could more accurately dose. (up until now all my doeses were +- 15mg) I found that just theanine by itself does some kind of wonders for me.

**Ceretropic L-theanine sublingual** - I got my sublingual drops last friday, but did not try them until sunday, as I wanted to take the weekend off and let everything come back to baseline so I could gauge the effects better. 
On sunday, I decided to do a test dose when  I didnt have to work to gauge the difference of effects. I took half the dose (50mg) and felt somewhat strange. I figured it was just that first time effect comming back since a different method of intake was used. The weirdness wore off pretty quickly, and I felt it almost as strong as the 200mg oral. It felt a lot more head strong and I almost felt somewhat stimulated. I ended up cleaning and getting a bunch done, then playing some video games and noticed my aim/reaction time in the game was MUCH better than usual.
On monday I took the full dose (100mg) and let it melt under my tongue while taking a shower. It was really quite intense compared to anything up to this point. My body was relaxed, and yet my mind was racing. I went to work and was extremely productive for the first 2-3 hours, then the effects started to die down and I started feeling kinda tired as if I had drank a coffee. When I went to lunch ~5.5 hours after initial dose, I felt the need to redose again (100mg) because I was at this point chasing that initial productivity I felt in the morning. I didn't think much of it because it was 100mg in the morning, then 100mg as lunch, which was cumulatively the same as the 200mg I was taking orally. This was a BAD IDEA. By the time I got back to work from lunch, I was feeling really impaired, my anxiety was going through the roof, and I felt somewhat sick/nauseous. I was also developing a weird headache. I just forced myself to make it through the rest of the day without freaking out, and feeling like I was going to feint. I learned from this that redosing is a bad idea. 

This leads me to yesterday, where I dosed in the morning, and went through the whole day feeling pretty great, and even though the intial effects tapered off after a few hours again, I found that through the rest of the day I had subtle relaxation and clear focus effects.

Today I decided to pass on the sublingual and try oral again. I took 200mg Orally (powder)  this morning and about an hour later drank a coffee. So far I am feeling really good and slow onset. 

**Conclusions** - It seems to me at this point, that if I am looking for a nice relaxed/slow onset with steady effects through the day, Oral is the way to go. If I want a speedish feeling with strong onset, and strong effects over a shorter period of time, exactly 50% the oral dose sublingual is the way to go. Regaurdless, I don't really like caffine that much anymore. Even though I had a coffee today, and I can feel the focus/energy, Caffine just doesnt work well for me on a daily basis as I build up anxiety and the effects diminish. So occasional caffine works best for me.

**Additional thoughts/side effects** - When taken Orally, I find that I drink a lot more water, and make frequent trips to take a pee. Regaurdless of how I take it, I seem to have an increased appetite and eat more throughout the day. I am hypoglycemic so when my blood sugar gets low I need to eat. When I get that feeling where I need to eat, I can normally push it off for a couple hours, but when taking theanine, I seem to be able to only go about an hour before it gets unbearable and I HAVE TO EAT. Strange side effect but I have noticed a much stronger responce to blood sugar levels.

I got started back in highschool when my buddy found out about piracetam and we tried it out.

I have always had some amount of Depression/Anxiety through out my entire life, and never knew that's what it was until I went to college. I have found from reading, personal experiences, and discussions with others, that college seems to bring any mental health problems to the surface, and in full force. Of course there are a lot of other contributing factors, but the college lifestyle is conducive to bad diet, heavy drinking, potential drug abuse, lazieness, and a high stress environment.

Anyways, I have been consuming marijuana since I was 16 with my largest breaks being a couple months. For a long time I felt that this fueled the Anxiety I have which I am also sure is the main cause of my depression. Anxiety is just so draining on a person that I think it would be hard not to become depressed. It reached a point where every time I smoked I would have a panic attack that lasted several hours. I would roll up in a ball on my bed and just keep repeating ""your not going to die"" over and over to myself. It was the only way I could make it through and the worst part was, that after it eventually ended I would smoke again within a few hours and repeat the entire process. While in college I was eventually put on a couple different SSRI's by first my doctor, and then eventually a specialist. First I was on Celexa, but the side effects were really strong and I had to stop taking it. I was then switched to Prozac, and over the course of 3 months ramped up to a full dose. It worked..... at first. I was much more social, pleasant to be around, less negative... you know.... all the signs of not being depressed. However this slowly turned into something else that was much, MUCH, worse. After about 6 months or so of the full dose, I am not sure when, but my drinking habits had started to get out of hand. And eventually I realised I was drinking so heavily to try and compensate for the lack of feeling/emotion. The Prozac had completely numbed me from emotions. It continued to get worse. I got violent. I constantly wanted to hurt things for reasons I can't put into words. Just an entire numbness from emotion was almost driving me into a psychosis. I actually did hurt things, and thats when I had to bring it up with my specialist. He immediately took me off the Prozac cold turkey and gave me another prescription of clonazepam (which I had for anxiety on an as-needed basis. I avoided taking it as much as possible because I know the addictive potential and the issues with withdrawals). That was the last I ever saw of him. I was upset that every time I saw a doctor they just gave me the cookie cutter solution (SSRI) without listening to my problems. (I should also note that the violent thoughts, tendancies, etc. continued for almost a year after I stopped taking the Prozac. I also did a ton of research on it, and was shocked by what I found. Prozac has been almost proven to cause violent tendancies in a very small portion of the population, but doctors either don't know about this, or dont tell people. Even one of the kids from Columbine was on Prozac leading up to the shooting... Do a quick google search on Prozac and violence if your interested)

Since I was sick of the medications I started seeing a shrink. That did some good, though after a while I didn't really see how it was of any benefit because every visit was just me talking. So I stopped seeing anybody for my issues all together and figured I was the only person who can sort out my own problems.

I had started taking Nootropics again (stopped because of potential/unknown reactions with SSRI's). I started out with the basics: Piracetam, choline, a multivitamin, and Alpha brain (ya I know Joe Rogan blah blah, this was the original formulation back then which was actually good). My Anxiety and Depression started to creep back into my life and I took a new approach. Since most of my Depression was caused by my Anxiety, and my Anxiety stemmed from a general fear of dieing. I gave up on caring. The prozac and hopelessness for such a long time contributed greatly to my ability to just not care anymore. I got Anxiety and panic attacks which I could feel but I would simply say to myself ""Welp if I die, who cares"" and slowly my anxiety started to go away. It still affected my life on a daily basis but I just chose to ignore it no matter how physically uncomfortable I became. I also started taking mushrooms/LSD a lot around this time. I had done it in the past but only a handful of times and spread out over a long period of time.

Eventually I had the strongest trip of my life on mushrooms and lost touch with reality. Like completely lost touch. I didn't exist. The room I was in didn't exist. I had no Ego. I was drifting through space, one with everything. It was the most vivid and mind blowing experience of my entire life. Some people in the drug community have a term for it ""satori enlightenment"" but I personally would have to say it felt like death. Not in a bad way, but in a way such that I realized that we are all just particles that are part of our universe. We are just an assortment of those particles that is constantly trying to separate from the universe and think of ourselves as something else. But at that point in time I had been assimilated by the universe and become a part of it again.

I know that that previous paragraph seems really ""out there"" and kinda like crazy talk. Most of you probably won't understand it. But it has relevance to this post because after that, my anxiety started to melt away. It never completely went away, but I was able to cope with things much easier, and all the Anxiety I had through the rest of college was directly related to my work load and leaving things to the last minute. Well... mostly... because I had some Nootropic expereinces that were HORRIBLE. Most notably with rhodiola rosea.

I stayed on my Piracetam/vitamin/Alpha brain stack until they changed the Alpha brain formulation and the new one was just horrible. It didn't do anything, plus Piracetam became insanely hard to get. So I started searching for alternatives. I had tried ashwagandha in the past, and really didn't like it. It made me feel tense and actually increased my anxiety. I tried 5-HTP and it seemed to improve my mood a bit, but I didn't like the fact that it is somewhat in the same catagory as an SSRI. So I read a lot about rhodiola rosea and how much everybody seemed to like it. The first day I took rhodiola rosea, I combined it with some piracetam I had left. At first it seemed pretty nice with the desired effects, Uplifting mood, less stressed, a little more energetic. But about 4 hours later I started to get a really weird headache. IT got bad enough to the point where I thought that smoking marijuana would help alleviate the headache. WRONG. As soon as I smoked it spiraled me into a massive panic attack and ruined the whole rest of my day. After that experience I shelved the rhodiola rosea and stopped taking any nootropics for about a year. It was also the first panic attack I had in 6+ months.

Now having been out of college for a while I was relaxed at first. Relieved to be done with the stress and worload of college, and I have a salaried job, my own house, a new car, anything I want. Life is good. But after a few months the 9-5 work week was starting to take its toll and then my student loans are hitting me, along with other bills and unexpected major expenses. This has started building up to stress and I have had some lingering depression for a while. I started smoking marijuana heavily again after work and my depression has become worse. I was starting to see myself losing motivation at work and I didn't want that to happen. I generally have had bad reactions to caffine in the past because of my anxiety, and the only stimulant that has ever had me really productive without much on the side of bad side effects was adderall... but thats not very easy to get and is expensive. So I did a lot of research on alternatives and ended up buying some guarana extract. I have been taking it every morning for the past 2 months, and it was great at first. I had nice steady energy throughout the day, I could focus on work a lot, I was getting a lot done when I got home. However these effects have worn off slowly and now I find myself taking them once a day just to feel normal.

So yesterday I was on here looking around for things to try and boost my mood/level me out. I read up on rhodiola rosea quite a bit and since I have a bunch still I decided to give it another try. I took 1 of the Now foods 500mg rhodiola caps I had at lunch. And was feeling relatively good throughout the day with the desired effects. I was a lot more productive too. Then I came home, still feeling good, made some cheeseburgers on the grill and had 1 beer. I ate the cheeseburgers and smoked a Dab per my daily routine after work. Things went bad REAL FAST. I started to feel really tense and had enormous waves of anxiety through my whole body. My whole chest started feeling tense, I was breathing irregularly and went into a full blown Panic attack. I havent had a Panic attack in over a year and this triggered it. And this was probably one of the worst I have ever had. I have slight liver issues from drinking heavily on prozac in college and my whole liver/gallbladder area was in serious pain. I couldn't tell if it was just from the panic attack or if something was seriously wrong. So since I live by myself with nobody to check up on me I wanted to get out of the house and into a populated area so if I did collapse somebody could help me (hopefully). So I walked around town thinking over and over that I would be ok and I hope my liver wasnt failing for about 4 hours until I was exhausted and mostly calmed down. Now today I am still feeling Anxiety aftershocks and don't really know what to do anymore.

I have been debating making a post on /r/stackadvice but thought I would share my experiences here first while all of this is still fresh in my mind. One thing that was interesting was how I couldn't wuiet my mind during the panic attack. it was going the fastest I think it ever has and would not stop. Its like the filter in my brain for irrational thoughts had completely collapsed and every single thought, rational, irrational, or other, was going straight through my subconcious into my concious. I had also been contemplating trying out modafanil because it is easier to get than adderall but I don't really know at this point.

Anyways thanks for reading and if any of you have had similar experiences I would love to head about them!",Nootropics,"8 Years of Nootropics, My Experiences (Long Post)",http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/3e87ez/8_years_of_nootropics_my_experiences_long_post/
