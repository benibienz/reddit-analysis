3,"One form of meditation you can try in the situation where you can only see the image is to deconstruct the experience. For example you can track change in the image, and mentally note when an aspect of it gets dimmer, stronger, bigger, smaller, moves this way or that, or when this part or that disappears. You can just say to yourself 'change' or whatever word you like when you notice it. Don't try to make it do anything, just allow it to do what it wants and track it with as much equanimity as you can.

You can do the same thing for changes in the physical emotional reactions and mental talk that come along with the image, or maybe you'll have more luck focusing on just the changes in emotions or talk and leaving the image alone.

A lot of mental activity seems solid and continuous throughout time, but if you pay enough attention, track it long enough, and gain enough experience you can notice that it's often quite fluid, and comes and goes. The trick here is to act as an observer and fully allow it to come and go and move and stay still as it pleases.

Thoughts are given momentum when you reject them or latch on to them, basically when you're reactionary. Doing something like deconstructing thoughts, or any form of meditation that allows you to observe with equanimity, might help you to not get caught up in the moment that you're experiencing it, and over the long term can help train you to be more equanimous in general.

There are other things you can try too, like finding a [mantra](http://www.dharma-haven.org/tibetan/meaning-of-om-mani-padme-hung.htm) or chant, best in a language you're not fluent in, and chanting and focusing as much as you can on it. I don't have experience with OCD so I don't know what you'll find most helpful, but these are some of the options still available in your situation.",2016-09-21 03:06:39+00:00,d7vjojs,5.0,t1_d7ugs9t,54174.0,DimensionalJumping

5,"Well of the kinds of projects I'm thinking of: I made a bot on public that will ""divine the true meaning"" of the last thing said, using banks of adjectives, adverbs, nouns, and verbs to replace words in what was said with random words of the appropriate type. There's a flask object that will get you temporarily ""drunker"" the more swigs you take, and allow you to speak with an increasing slur, replacing characters randomly. There's ""voice changer"" thing that changes the colors of what you say in a variety of ways. Right now I'm working on game of chicken type thing with dueling pistols, where the longer you aim the higher chance you have of making the shot, sending the person back to the common room.

Most of the ideas that are interesting to me involve text manipulation, given the medium. But I'm open to anything.

&gt; Forgetfulness of the world and of everything, except GOD.

8,"I'm sorry that she frames you as the bad guy. That really can't feel good. I don't think finding an argument to justify your view sounds like the way to go though, at least right now. It sounds like she needs to process her choice, but instead she's trying to take out her discomfort and guilt and cognitive dissonance on you. So if that's what's going on, providing a argument in opposition to hers is just going to allow her to continue to frame her feelings as something in opposition to you, instead of her own internal conflict. In other words, arguing with her might prevent her from owning her issues.

I don't know what your interactions with her are like right now, but at some point it might be helpful to talk about the differences you have in your core beliefs that are at the roots of your positions, just to you understand where you're each coming from. I'm thinking of something like the common difference of beliefs where the pro-life person thinks the fetus is a human life, and the pro-choice person thinks it's just something that has the potential to become a human life. But it'd be important to try not to let it devolve into an argument or debate where she can offload her issues on to you.

There's a good book that might help if you decide to do this, or if you expect more communication from her about this, called *Nonviolent Communication*. There's a summary of it [here](http://www.wanttoknow.info/inspiration/nonviolent_communication_summary_nvc).",2016-08-17 01:08:31+00:00,d6kiuse,1.0,t3_4y1iw4,18425.0,TwoXChromosomes

But I don't have any experience with OCD or Pure-O OCD so it's just a guess that the situations might be comparable, plus that methodology might not be something many therapists often work with.",2016-07-11 07:04:16+00:00,d57lvd8,4.0,t1_d57k8yc,4293.0,MensLib

It imposed a hermetically sealed package of beliefs about the nature of the self, and the futility of striving ... including explicit renunciations of every mode of reasoning able to illuminate the core belief’s failings.

&gt; Analysis with a standard tool confirmed that the outlook was universally self-affirming. Once you ran it, you could not change your mind. Once you ran it, you could not be talked out of it.",2016-05-18 06:29:34+00:00,d39xakj,5.0,t1_d39u7k1,7266.0,AskReddit

91,"If your spaceplane tumbles it likely has to do with your center of lift being too far forward relative to your center of mass. When you're designing it in the SPH be sure the COL is a bit behind the COM, but also empty the tanks and make sure the same situation applies when you're almost out of fuel.

There's a design mod called RCS Build Aid that'll show you the wet and dry center of mass without you having to empty all the tanks. I've found it to be pretty inaccurate with its engine torque measurement but good enough for eyeballing dry and wet COM.

Another thing to worry about is the fuel not actually being distributed evenly on reentry due to the distribution of tanks with regard to fuel type, using engines other than Rapiers that draw fuel unevenly, the extra weight of a recovered hulk, or oddities of design. If you find yourself tumbling on what you think should be a good design you can always revert and shift fuel forward. There's also a mod for this though called TAC Fuel Balancer that makes moving fuel a bit easier and has an option to auto-balance all tanks.

In either case you'd want to be sure the lipos are pretty close in voltage levels before you charge. If you go with the second cable that would just mean connecting the lipos and letting them sit for a while before charging as long as they're all in the same ballpark.

If you invest in becoming fully lucid then you have more leverage. You could try to just change that aspect of the dream. You could have a dream with the feeling there while not taking the feeling seriously, because if you're lucid you can remind yourself that all you experience is your own mind. I'd think there's a good chance that doing this over and over again would lesson the dynamic that might be going on now.

Or you could have fun with it and choose to have the feeling manifest as something in the dream. Maybe it has something to tell or show you that will resolve the issue and provide some insight. Or maybe it will attack you and you can stand invulnerable, or hug and comfort it, or absorb it, etc. It's all a game, and it's up to you as long as you maintain lucidity and remind yourself that it's all just you.
