Our primary interest is worldbuilding and coding, but I'd really like it if we could have an in-depth D&amp;Dish party-based combat system too.

We had a simple MUSH server once upon a time but it's been like 10 years since I've seriously messed with this stuff, so please assume I'm a noob. I appreciate your help!
