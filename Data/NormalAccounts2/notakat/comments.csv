48,"I'd strongly suggest starting on the sidebar (see: building a basic wardrobe) and going from there. Maybe read through some other posts for inspiration on style.

You might also be interested in a capsule wardrobe (try searching the sub). It seems you like to keep things simple and the idea behind capsule wardrobes is that you have a few ""core"" pieces that you can mix and match to make up several outfits using fewer articles of clothing. I have blue and black slacks/chinos and wear them with white or blue dress shirts to work every day (plus a belt, watch, and shoes with socks). When I'm not working, simple solid color t shirts with short khaki shorts or a dark blue/black pair of raw denim jeans if it's colder out. There are obviously some seasonal items and accessories I'm leaving out but, you get the picture. You don't need much.

Although, with capsule wardrobes, you typically want to spend more as you'll be wearing and washing the same articles of clothing more frequently. So, be advised.

Good luck. I lurk more than post here but, I keep up with trends and consider myself to be well-dressed. Happy to help if you need anything.",2016-07-27 15:21:39+00:00,d5t1m3a,1.0,t3_4uuzd2,1904.0,malefashionadvice

88,"Last Light (Painting by Casey Childs)

&amp;nbsp;

There before me 

On a blanket of grass 

Head perched thoughtfully

Toward the horizon

&amp;nbsp;

Your eyes closing in slow motion

As the last light shoots off

From the distant skyline

&amp;nbsp;

Piercing your red umbrella

Casts a crimson shadow

On your pale visage 

&amp;nbsp;

I know all of the lines of you

I have traced them with my fingers

Countless times

92,"Love by Billy Collins.


The boy at the far end of the train car
kept looking behind him
as if he were afraid or expecting someone

and then she appeared in the glass door
of the forward car and he rose
and opened the door and let her in

and she entered the car carrying
a large black case
in the unmistakable shape of a cello.

She looked like an angel with a high forehead
and somber eyes and her hair
was tied up behind her neck with a black bow.

And because of all that,
he seemed a little awkward
in his happiness to see her,

whereas she was simply there,
perfectly existing as a creature
with a soft face who played the cello.

And the reason I am writing this
on the back of a manila envelope
now that they have left the train together

is to tell you that when she turned
to lift the large, delicate cello
onto the overhead rack,

I saw him looking up at her
and what she was doing
the way the eyes of saints are painted

when they are looking up at God
when he is doing something remarkable,
something that identifies him as God.",2016-03-11 05:07:09+00:00,d0vnkoh,1.0,t3_49n271,164201.0,Poetry

100,"Hey. Feel free to PM me if you want but let me just say, I exited the public school system at exactly the same time. 3rd grade. I'm 23 now and nearly done with my BA.

Basically, I was removed from school to be ""homeschooled"" because my parents moved a lot for my dad's work. Unfortunately, we were not very wealthy so both my parents worked. The result was that I fell quickly behind and was never able to rejoin the public school system. They meant well but it just happened that way.

With my background out of the way, let me tell you a few things:

Don't be embarrassed. I was for a long time. I felt stupid. You have nothing to be ashamed of. What happened to you was negligent and technically illegal. It is actually quite a large issue in some rural parts of America and is something I've been interested in trying to change through non-profit work, eventually. At any rate, you are not weird or alone. There are lots of us.

It IS NOT too late for you to turn things around. I swear. I eventually decided to get my GED at 18. I graduated with honors and started college soon after. I currently have a 3.8 GPA and am nearly finished with my undergrad. I live on my own and have a well paying job. I struggled with a couple things at first but, I am so certain that you will be surprised by how much you actually *didn't miss* by not going to public school. As it turns out, in my experience, the public school system is actually not very efficient. 

Anyways, there's a lot I could say here but OP, please reach out to me and I will help in any way I can.

Edit: for anyone interested, please see [this link](http://www.responsiblehomeschooling.org/child-wellbeing/educational-neglect/) for more information about this issue",2016-02-12 05:41:20+00:00,czx0ltu,1.0,t3_45cmev,10377.0,Advice

105,"There is absolutely nothing abnormal about wanting to get fit or look nice. Although, pressure from advertisements and celebrities have given us all an unrealistic idea of what it is to be ""attractive"" so there's a good chance you look fine. I wouldn't be too concerned with plastic surgery or injections as you might just be being too critical of yourself. That being said, it's 2016 and you should really do whatever it is that makes you feel comfortable. I just feel that you can always find something ""wrong"" with you and changing yourself isn't the answer. You will never be satisfied, as opposed to learning to love yourself, which will bring you long term happiness.

TLDR, learn to love yourself. By all means, exercise and get the body you want, learn about fashion, learn to do your makeup well if that's what you're into. But don't change yourself based on your perception of beauty because you won't be satisfied.

Edit: there are a lot of supportive communities on reddit. Take advantage of them.

108,"I only felt inclined to comment because of how similar my recent situation is to yours.

My (now ex) girlfriend and I were for 4 1/2 years before we split up a few weeks ago. Basically, she was ready to get married and I just couldn't see myself ever getting married.

I struggled for a long time because I did/do love her and didn't want to break up, but I couldn't really justify my preferences and I didn't want to lie to her and end up splitting up even later into our lives, wasting her time.

I think for me I just don't really believe in the institution of marriage, despite having examples of successful long term marriages in my family (divorce as well, though.) My opinion is that people are at some points in their lives, ""right for each other"" and at other times, not. My belief is that you shouldn't worry so much and should enjoy each other as long as your relationship will last.

That being said, you can't really expect any one who is even slightly conventional to want to stick around under those kinds of circumstances.

I'm just describing my situation, though. You could very well want marriage but just aren't sure if you want it with her, specifically. In which case, you might want to consider being honest with her so the two of you can move on.",2016-02-05 17:57:38+00:00,czp1qj7,1.0,t3_44b7ui,9865.0,Advice

As for your work friends: you can always hangout with them in another setting. My very best friend and I met at an old mutual job and we both hangout weekly despite having different jobs now at different companies.

For your crush: if you plan on quitting or seeking alternative employment, work up the nerve to ask for his or her number/etc before you quit so you can make plans later. 

Also, I know firsthand that working and going to school full time sucks but, you may want to find another job before quitting your current one.
