Early this morning I was picking up my girlfriend from the airport. While I was parked outside of baggage claim waiting for her, I noticed there was only one valet guy working. Maybe because it was so early.

He comes up to my window and knocks on it before I can roll it down. I roll down the window and he asks me when her flight arrived.

I tell the guy her flight had arrived about twenty minutes ago and that she was going to be coming out shortly. He asks me to do another loop around the terminal. There were only two or three other cars parked outside of baggage claim so there's really no need I told him. He demands that I do another lap and says he'll have to contact airport security if I don't comply. Real rude like.

So begins my revenge.

Instead of driving down the strip and making a loop around the terminal I just drove all the way down to the other end of baggage claim and parked.

Since he was the only one there, I watched him walk in my rear view mirror all the way over to my car but before he actually got there my girlfriend had come out.

I'm totally uneducated in BJJ so, bear with me:

My 15 year old brother started training at a local gym a couple months ago and desperately needs a gi. My mother cannot quite afford to purchase one for him as she runs a 5 child household by herself and makes very little money. He, along with our two siblings, were adopted by my family several years ago and my parents have since divorced so just affording the classes is kind of tough.

He's an awesome kid and totally deserves it so, I wanted to surprise him with a gi for Christmas but I'm having trouble figuring out what size to get.

I have his measurements based on [this chart](http://imgur.com/FKtvF7g) in inches/cm:

A: 54 / 137
B: 22 / 55
C: 16 / 40
D: 37 / 93
E: 16 / 40

Could anyone help me out? Also, does the color of the gi matter? Thanks in advanced!
