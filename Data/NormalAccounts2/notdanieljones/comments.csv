16,"Assuming you have no prior knowledge regarding stocks, investopedia is a great place to begin.  First, you need to learn the basics and gain an understanding of the markets.  Any terms that you come across should have definitions and examples on investopedia.  It also has a great 'paper trading' simulator that will allow you to practice without risking your own capital.  I'm going to make a second assumption that you've saved a little bit of money or you received it as a gift and want it to grow.. speaking long term the best thing to do for you would be to look into index funds, you can expect an average annual return around 9% if you continually invest, without too much worrying (look up dollar cost averaging).  If you're thinking ya ya whatever that's boring, okay i understand completely, you just need to realize how low your chances are of beating the market and the risk you're taking on.  I started trading when I was 17 so you have a slight advantage over myself and no matter what, the earlier you start investing...the better.  I would suggest paper trading for a while so you can understand the mechanics before using your own money, then download the Robinhood app which will allow you to make small trades for free without commission.",2015-11-01 23:10:37+00:00,cwkxpet,1,t3_3r4wwk,1978,stocks

27,it's a simple non-directional play in which you buy a call and a put at the same strike price.  You profit from movement in either direction as long as the price change is greater than the premium.  I purchased at the strike price of $115 so my trade will be profitable if the stock raises higher than $119 or drops below $111.  Your maximum loss is capped at the premium paid.  This strategy is often used when volatility is high and you don't want to make a play on direction.,2015-10-27 18:18:26+00:00,cwev5e9,3,t1_cweuow6,648,wallstreetbets

43,"I'm a student finishing a double major in Finance / Accounting this December.  I've spent that last several months researching trading firms and the process of getting in so I can share a bit of my insight.  I was originally studying engineering, but like yourself, I grew a strong interest in the financial markets and started to self educate myself, eventually switching majors and pursuing trading.  The market I'm breaking into is option trading in Chicago.  There are many proprietary trading firms (market makers) in the city and also obviously New York.  The concept is they have a large amount  of capital and their traders make trades based on set parameters and algorithms. If you're looking to break into this, you might want to consider making a move to NY or Chicago.  So what is the structure of the jobs here?  First, many start of as an intern under the traders.. which is a great way to go if you can.  Often, they are very receptive to bringing interns on if you can show the enthusiasm you're showing here.  Then, you can get hired as a junior trader where you go full on learning their systems and the business.  Almost every prop trading firm wants someone with very strong math skills, and they often will ask you mental math questions in the interviews... some can be very challenging.  It is a game of statistics, algorithms, and taking emotion out of the game.  

To your last question, it depends on your college situation.  For this semester, I was offered a job as an analyst following my internship so I am working and finishing my last classes in the evening.  It is a very long week but I'm trying to get ahead of the game.  I've currently made it through a few of the several interviews with the firms I am interested in for full time trading positions starting in January.  If you have any other questions or thoughts let me know! I love talking to like minded individuals.",2015-09-27 19:31:52+00:00,cvg2xyn,1,t3_3mknpd,23043,stocks

None of these things (except the bigger screen) really got any attention until apple pushes it.  For example, even though the watch is being looked at as a failure, everyone still knows what it is when early android watches were really restricted to the tech community.

80,"I am in a similar boat, 21 and I'm holding quite a bit Apple at various buy points over the passed year and a half.  Lately, I've transitioned into a dollar-cost averaging strategy buying into Vanguard Total stock and small cap etf.  I've sold out of most of my individual stocks but I'm continuing to hold Apple.  Estimates for the earnings date next week look decent and it's been nothing but positives related to iPhone sales.  Although not something to base a trade off of, I'm seeing quite a few price targets &gt;140 so I would say keep holding and collect dividends.  Just my 2c.",2015-07-14 21:30:54+00:00,ct3f0xe,1,t3_3daomt,3972,investing

83,"I have been using it for about 3 months now.  I'm testing out a dollar cost averaging strategy ( buying index etfs every week ) and also occasional speculative trades.  The zero commission really makes it awesome.  The charts on the app are pretty much useless but there are many other places online that can make up for it.  Also the only order types are market, stop loss, stop limit so don't expect to do anything more complex.  If you're looking for a place to buy and sell stocks for no commission then it is an excellent option.  If you get stuck on waiting list I might still have a skip the line code, feel free to pm me.
