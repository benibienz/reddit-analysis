us: HEY YOU!

you: ME?

us: YEAH YOU! DO YOU WANT TO HAVE FRIENDS AND WIN WARS?

Blasted™ is looking for some more players to compete with us in our bi-weekly clan wars. We war every Tuesday and Friday. We have 114 war wins. We are currently a level 8 and well on our way to becoming level 9.

Here's the deal... we've been around for over 2 years and seen quite a bit.  Currently looking for TH9's (open to some 8's if you're cool as F) right now with built troops and knowledge on most 3 star attack strategies. If interested look us up in game Blasted™ or feel free to ask any questions you might have. Include something about reddit in your request to join please. Something like ""Yo i'm sick at clash of clans... p.s. saw you on reddit"" or ""hey your clan looks awesome so let me in...reddit "" or maybe ""Saw you on reddit."" Seriously though, if you don't mention reddit... you might be left in purgatory forever.

RULES:
If you don't attack in the war, you're out (after a warning). We don't care if you have tits like Kate Upton or a super hilarious name... unless you donate max golems for days or we just happen to love you for some unseen reason, we are going to kick you out if you're not active. We will then proceed to make fun of your base, your name, your crappy 1 star attacks, and what we imagine your girlfriend to look like.

We understand there is this thing called real life... if you have something going on like you're making a trip to Africa to cure ebola, simply check yourself as red and let a co-lead know to keep you out. On the other hand, if you leave mid war... we will never ever ever let you back in, ever.

Elders and co-leads will give you advice and help out when possible. Unlike some clans that instantly grant ranks for no reason, this clan promotes players that understand the game and contribute to the clan.

SOME MORE THINGS THAT WILL MAKE YOU JOIN:

-There are only a few douchebags in the clan.

-Everyone is very competitive.

-We can help you with attacks if unsure.

-Joining this clan could get you laid possibly.

-Players from all over the world (not like 3rd world countries though).",ClashOfClansRecruit,[Recruiting] Blasted™ | TH 9 | War 2x week | Level 8 | Warring,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClansRecruit/comments/54ube5/recruiting_blasted_th_9_war_2x_week_level_8/

I've recently started drinking reds, cabs in particular, quite often.  It is exciting for me to try new things, for example i've been letting servers pick for me at restaurants lately.  Honestly, it is rare for me to drink something that I don't like, but obviously I like some more than others.  I'm curious to opinions on the best red wines for the money.  Most of the bottles I've been bringing home lately are less than $15 (Chicago).  Does anybody have any favorites around that price point that I should try?  I apologize in advance if this sounds like a noob question.  I figure if I'm enjoying cheaper wines at the moment I should live it up because I will eventually develop a taste for something more expensive.

Over the past two years the company has reported that its profitability was at its highest level despite selling fewer cars than the previous years.  Their growth strategy seems to focus on expanding into the emerging markets and not selling more cars into the current markets it operates in.  Lastly, the very small float will likely make this stock volatile, in combination with the current economic conditions.. this should be an interesting ride.

I'm thinking about limiting the game to stocks but I'm open for suggestions.  The format I am currently looking for would be for everyone to manage their own funds, say $100k of magical internet money from the future.  All input is appreciated!

I recently took a job in finance ( 7am - 5 pm  mon-fri) so I've stopped actively trading stocks and switched only to investing.  

I'm considering trading Forex in evenings (mon-thurs) during the Jap market.  I'm in the process of going through the entire educational section of r/forex and am finding it to be a wealth of useful information.  I'm planning on starting my demo trading next week to observe the markets but i'm trying to decide the best broker to go with.  I want to learn the platform I will be trading with through demo trading before I use real money.  One of my college professors recommended Interactive Brokers to me a while ago (for stocks) but I never made the switch.  Im currently using Etrade, Robinhood, and Optionshouse.  The $3K min would not be a problem as I am under 25.

Which broker do you find best?  
How has your experience been with Interactive?
Is there any downside?
Has anyone traded forex using Etrade?
Which has the best demo program?
Any other information to get started is greatly appreciated.
