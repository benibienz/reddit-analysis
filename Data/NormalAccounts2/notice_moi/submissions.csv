Our professor at school challenged us to build a 3d printer from scratch over the summer. The machine is finally assembled with all the wiring done.
Using marlin for the firmware and using pronterface to move it for the initial testing.
 The X+ button makes it go to the right
The Y+ button makes the bed move towards me
The Z+ button moves the z axis upwards.
The endstops are located on the right, at the back and at the bottom for the x, y and z axes respectively.

The endstops for the y and z directions seems to work as they should but the one on the x does not. When the x-carriage is moving towards the left and the endstop is triggered, the x carriage stops immediately(shouldnt this be the case when moving towards the right?)
