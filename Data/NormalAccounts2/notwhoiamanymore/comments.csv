4,"No, I think your understanding of how rendering works is fundamentally broken.

Emulators like Dolphin (and most old system emulators) aren't striving to emulate a software 1:1 virtual Wii.  They're emulating the few things that can't run natively, then trying to map things like rendering calls, etc to actual PC-compatible functions.  

An emulator like that renders natively at the selected resolution.  Dolphin can render natively at 4K resolution or higher, then downsamples to your display resolution.  This is a common graphics technique that can be found as an anti-aliasing option in plenty of PC games.

It's not like a Wii game is a series of 720x480 images that are being ""blown up"" to fit that resolution.  You can complain about the fact that most Wii models are low-poly and not particularly great, and you can argue about the texture assets with Wii and Gamecube games, but the actual rendering via Dolphin is absolutely ""high definition"" unless you have a terrible graphics card that can't handle it.

EDIT:  If my game is being natively rendered at 1920x1080 or higher, then it is, by definition, ""high definition"".  Just because the models and textures assets look like crap doesn't make it not fit the ""high definition"" standard, which EXCLUSIVELY applies to resolution.",2016-05-15 16:54:48+00:00,d36gtqy,11,t1_d36gfc2,681,GameDeals

""I do not like elderly people, because I do not share interests with them, nor do I fit in with them socially.""

""I do not like toddlers, because I do not share interests with them, nor do I fit in with them socially.""

That top one doesn't work because being old has nothing to do with their interests or social behavior.
