I'm in the Seattle area, and trying to find out who the ""go to"" surgeons in the US are -- in-network or out-of-network isn't a huge consideration as long as they are willing to submit to my insurance provider.

I have a few questions though:

* Who's the ""best"" in the USA that is at least willing to consider insurance?
* Should I be getting my scrotal v-shaped electrolysis now, or after I've talked to a doctor?
* I know some of the healing timeline information, but assuming I can work 100% remote for a few months (IT hooray), what's the shortest possible time I need to plan off of work?  The longest?
* I see some surgeons (like Dr. Marci Bowers) require weight to be proportional or under 210lb.  I'm 6'/260 -- down from damn near 300 -- I'm losing about 10 lbs/month with diet/exercise, but I know it will slow down once I get closer to my ideal weight (180-190, based on my frame) -- should I hold off scheduling, even knowing that most doctors book 1-3 years out?

I didn't think I needed a gaff but as I start to flesh out my style a bit more I'm starting to dislike my little ""friend"" showing and ruining looks.

I tried making my own gaff but I suck.

Also of note: I can't properly tuck thanks to having hernia repairs - it seems my inguinal canals are inaccessible.  I can do a quasi-tuck and tape convincingly but that's not feasible for day to day, a gaff would be a lot less time consuming.

Are there any particular gaff brands that are better, especially with regards to a larger body type?

Social security claims they will change if you have:

&gt;Full-validity, 10-year U.S. passport showing the new gender;
&gt;
&gt;State-issued amended birth certificate showing the new gender;
&gt;
&gt;Court order directing legal recognition of change of gender; or
&gt;
&gt;Medical certification of appropriate clinical treatment for gender transition in the form of an original letter from a licensed physician.

So, I have no idea how I would get a passport with that, I don't trust my birth state to not be shitty forever because they're moving backwards endlessly (WI, which requires SRS for birth cert amendment), I have no idea how to get a ""court order"".

I guess my biggest question is on that last point about medical certification -- can/will any licensed physician sign off on hormonal transition as ""enough"" for this?

I live in Seattle, WA which has a pretty wide number of people who can say ""yes, R is a woman"" so I'm not too worried about my driver's license.

What other big agencies do I need to worry about changing my identity with?

Also, is there any way I can just force WI to go fuck themselves and do what I want to my birth certificate without them needing certification of a surgery which shouldn't ever be their fucking business?",asktransgender,"Legal change of sex without ""the surgery""?",https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/3u3s8v/legal_change_of_sex_without_the_surgery/

I drink very rarely, I don't smoke, and I don't do drugs.  I have not DIYd HRT.

I have to talk to the doctor, obviously, but this scares me.  When we last talked (this is my second estrogen test, the previous one was exceptionally high for non-HRT as well), we talked about reasons this could happen.

The reasons we talked over:

* Behavioral/lifestyle-induced -- drugs, drinking, etc (which aren't a factor here)

* Estrogen-producing tumor.
* Potentially being some degree of intersex (but I think this is unlikely?  I have a child.)

Does anyone know anything else that could cause this?  I figured I'd ask here since people here are often a bit more in-tune with their hormonal levels than most people.
