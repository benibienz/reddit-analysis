I know that apparently you thought your ""smart"" comment would earn you some karma so that hopefully maybe one day people would consider you famous, but no, it won't, and you'll never be famous. Had you held your tongue, maybe you'd still have a chance, but instead you decided to spew bullshit everywhere and look where it got you. After reading your comment, I almost became blind, beaf, dumb, and braindead. Great! Keep commenting shit like this and the FBI will be looking for you for the mass genocide of 9000000 FUCKING REDDIT USERS. Maybe one day if you don't die of cancer first you'll move out of your Mom's basement, get a job, get married, and have kids, but I really doubt it. Had you realized the shitstorm that your comment would have brought, maybe you would have thought first, but you didn't and now your PAYING THE FUCKING PRICE KIDDO. Thats it, really, I'm almost done. Maybe at 9GAG you can get away with this, but here on Reddit we don't forgive, and we don't forget. I could delete all 15 Terabytes of porn on your harddrive with just the press of a button. I just wanted to tell you how much I disliked your comment. I could have just downvoted and walked away, but I felt something in you I couldn't just ignore. I needed to alert the world of your FUCKING STUPIDITY and ignorance to society in general. How does it feel being made fun by a RANDOM INTERNET USER ON A RANDOM WEBSITE. Whats that? You don't give a shit? Well damn, maybe 15 years later when you're still living under a bridge you'll remember the time you shitposted on Reddit. Thats all, I'm really done; really. I just wanted to alert you to what a shitty person you are.

686,"&gt;1. **What timezone are you in?** (in UTC)
&gt;&gt; UTC-8 (PST)

&gt;2. **How old is your reddit account?**
&gt;&gt; 1 year, 4 months

&gt;3. **What do you hope to contribute as a mod of /r/TIFU?** Do you have any special skill you can bring to the table?
&gt;&gt; I thoroughly enjoy modding communities on reddit, cleaning up subs and the like. I'm already on reddit all the time, so why not put that time to good use and help take care of subs? I'm already friends with a couple people on your mod team, so I'd love to work with you all as well. I'm looking forward to clearing the queues, responding to modmails, etc. I might not have a specific quality that makes me more desirable than other mods, but I would love to help this sub out by modding here.

&gt;4. **A very popular post hits the frontpage, with thousands of upvotes, it breaks our rules. What do you do?**
&gt;&gt; Definitely remove. If more people were to see that post stay at #1 on the sub, then they're going to think that kind of post is okay, when in actuality, it's not. I'm not sure if you guys flair or leave comments on removed threads with toolbox, but if you did, then I would do that as well.

&gt;5. **What was a popular world event that happened when you were under the age of 13?**
&gt;&gt; Apparently, Kmart Corp becomes the largest retailer in American history to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Don't ask me how I know that, because I don't.

&gt;6. **How often do you participate in the sub?**
&gt;&gt; I'm afraid I do not participate in the sub too often, but instead only read from my front page. 

&gt;7. **What other communities are you involved in?** (on or offline / reddit or elsewhere)
&gt;&gt; Off of reddit, the only communities I'm involved in would be various Slack teams (which one could contend is still on reddit, but meh). On reddit, I lurk and occasionally participate in subs like /r/KenM, /r/FanTheories, /r/pettyrevenge, /r/funkopop, /r/harrypotter, /r/asoiaf, etc.

&gt;8. **Do you have any other mod experience on reddit or elsewhere?** 
&gt;&gt; Yes. I currently mod /r/politics, recently came on board at /r/OutOfTheLoop, mod a few subs in the SFWPorn Network, mod a few subs in the Being Network, formerly modded almost all subs in the Imaginary Network: Expanded (but now only mod a few), used to mod /r/PoliticalDiscussion, and various other smaller ones. 

&gt;9. **How would you mediate a tense situation?**
&gt;&gt; Between users? I'd closely monitor the conversation, and watch for any instances of breaking rule #5. If the rule is broken, I'll step in and put an end to the convo. If the tense situation is between mods, I'd first try to understand what this heated discussion was about. Then, I'd confer with other mods and try to reach a resolution.

&gt;10. **Are you willing &amp; available to communicate with the mod team using outside resources?** (such as slack)
&gt;&gt; Definitely. As I write my answer to this question, I'm currently shitposting with some of you on the DM slack. I sincerely hope you guys have an #nj-sucks channel on your Slack because one specific mod (not naming any names) in particular needs to face the truth. 

&gt;11. **What are your opinions on Last Thursdayism?**
&gt;&gt; Along with most of your mod team, I don't see it happening.

&gt;12. **What is your favorite meme?**
&gt;&gt; ~~I'd like to pander to you guys to get added, so I'm gonna say dat boi because I know how much some of the mods here love it.~~ What other answer can there be besides /r/partyparrot?

&gt;13. **Anything else you would like to add?**

951,"Yeah, I posted that admin blog post earlier here. Wait, so is the only thing we're really disagreeing on now whether or not the ban message should be sent to people who aren't subscribed, but have gained/lost karma in the past? 

&gt; It's like defending two water fountains for different races because it was the law at the time. Just because it was within the rules doesn't make it a valid defense?

Well, the thing is, I would agree with this statement if you hadn't talked about this breaking the ""spirit of reddit"" earlier. It's pretty contradicting to state that we shouldn't really listen to reddit's criteria on whether or not someone is a part of a community, but then state that this breaks the spirit of reddit as indirectly stated by reddit itself (""they clearly did not find it being in the spirit of reddit""). Reason being, you're disregarding reddit's criteria for being a part of a community, but then attempting to use reddit's criteria on the same issue to define what breaks the spirit of reddit. 

&gt; It's still being done, but now only to people who have posted or subscribe.

And this is perfectly fine. Firstly, it's worth mentioning that it's not if you've posted, it's whether you've gained or lost karma. Meaning, you could make a ton of submissions and comments, but if they fly under the radar, you won't get the ban message. Nor will you get it if you have a self-post with 1k upvotes, you didn't gain karma from it, so you don't get a ban message. The thing is, if someone's actively participated in a sub before and gained/lost karma, it's completely fair for them to receive a ban message since participating in a sub means you're part of the community there.

&gt; So has my view shifted? Several of my beliefs and objections were overcome, just not all of them. To be fair, if I were to rewrite my CMV I would be changing the goalposts. If someone has to change the goalposts is that not a view change?

Yeah, I originally asked that because I thought so. I was asking per [Comment Rule 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_4). ",2016-06-03 08:42:21+00:00,d3u8qqu,,t1_d3u75zu,5218.0,changemyview
952,"Wait, so then, has your view changed for the most part since you only believe that it's against the spirit of reddit?

But when you say that you don't believe they should get to use that due to it being against the spirit of reddit, what exactly do you mean by the ""spirit of reddit?"" The mods are operating under the rules of reddit, not breaking reddiquette or anything like that, so what exactly are they breaking if they're simply sending out a ban message to what reddit counts as members of their community?",2016-06-03 07:08:06+00:00,d3u70qp,,t1_d3u6tws,554.0,changemyview

958,"I would completely agree with you that it's abuse if the message was sent to everyone. The thing is, since it's only sent to subscribers or people who've lost/gained karma in that specific sub, it's not abuse because by reddit's standards, they were a part of that community (presently or in the past). The ban message is therefore sent to all members of that community who've been banned.

Your analogy with the friend's house isn't the same thing because in this case, you've been to Person B's house before (Person B being the one who came up to you later after you went to your friend's house). If you hadn't been to Person B's house before, I'd agree that it would be abuse if some random person got mad that you went to your friend's house.",2016-06-02 20:44:14+00:00,d3tl80z,,t1_d3tk33f,1500.0,changemyview

1029,"Greetings gocgo1. Unfortunately your submission has been removed from /r/AnimalsBeingJerks because our rules do not allow:

* Posts of animals being killed or seriously injured



If you feel like this was done in error, or if you have any questions, please [message the moderators.](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAnimalsBeingJerks)",2016-05-31 01:03:38+00:00,d3psz3j,1.0,t3_4ls8zz,5642.0,AnimalsBeingJerks
1030,"&gt; Say mod of one default sub does this to another default sub with millions or hundreds of thousands of overlap?

Quick note on this. This would be extremely hard (may not actually be possible) to do as there's a rate limit involved with banning people like that (sort of similar to how when one first makes an account, they must wait ten minutes in between comments, or like how you have to wait ten minutes between submissions sometimes). A lot of times, private subs run into a rate limit when first starting out because they attempt to add people to the sub too fast, and the reddit rate limit prevents them from doing that any further. 

So in this case, that would be extremely difficult to do because reddit's built-in rate limit would stop that many people from being banned like that.",2016-05-31 00:52:13+00:00,d3psjsi,3.0,t1_d3p66ga,36986.0,changemyview

1044,"The way that reddit works, you only get a ban message if you have ever participated in a subreddit, or if you are subscribed to that subreddit. Meaning, I could ban you right now from /r/nt337, but you wouldn't get a ban message because you aren't subscribed/haven't participated there. I'm sure there's plenty of people in the /r/offmychest ban list right now who do not know that they are banned from there because they haven't participated there/are not a subscriber.

&gt; Would it break reddit it every single person made a sub, set up a bot, and then set this up on the front page subs for everyone who posts in them?

That wouldn't happen because everyone in the front page subs would have to subscribe/participate in the new subreddit.

2253,"First off, I think you're talking about comments, not posts, because you don't seem to have ever posted here.

Secondly, originally when you made your reddit account, you did indeed have a time limit on how much you could comment. You seem to have gained sufficient comment karma in this sub since then so that you didn't have that time limit any longer. When you suddenly lost a bunch of karma however, the native reddit tools kicked in and prevented you from commenting too often. I repeat, it isn't something that the mods are doing.",2016-03-05 20:05:31+00:00,d0otka1,5.0,t1_d0otfm9,242.0,politics
2254,"I'm a bit confused on what you're saying. There is a native reddit feature for **everyone** on reddit that they have to wait ten minutes in between submitting posts unless they have accumulated an unknown amount of link karma in that sub. Mods are not limiting how often one can submit, it's reddit that is doing that. 

However, here at /r/politics, we actually have a rule that everyone (that means Bernie supporters, Hillary supporters, Trump supporters, etc) all have to wait ten minutes in between posts.",2016-03-05 19:54:29+00:00,d0ot7dv,3.0,t1_d0ot1w4,280.0,politics

2283,"# Random thoughts of mine while perusing this

* Thanks for making this script Crystal, gives us access to a lot more stats!
* I especially love the percentage of posts submitted by mods
* I also really like how you can sort by tab
* Pssst, Runeterra isn't part of the network anymore
* We're gonna need to either cull a lot of under-performing subs, or at least take them off the dropdown
* Pssst, Futurism, Colorscapes, and Gatherings aren't on there yet
* Wait, so is the criteria for healthy/unhealthy/critical the same as Midnight's health check?
* Pssst, NewEden also isn't in the network
* Maps reached 20k this month!
* Behemoths reached 10k!
* The ads did wonders for Castles! 4k new subs!
* Over 4k submissions to INE subs this month!!!!!
* ITW lost a few subscribers :(
* Mindscapes doing amazing as usual!
* Kinda surprised that Dragons didn't get as many new subscribers from ads as Castles, would've thought it the other way around
* Forests reached 2k subscribers! The first Nature sub to do so!
* BestOf in the top 20 now!
* Poor Westeros :(
* Fallout dropped off a bit in terms of its recently stellar subscriber gain, I guess Valar bot is out of batteries or something
* Jerk got twelve whole subscribers!!!!! Probably a new record!
* The NSotW did great for Mythology!
* I'm pleasantly surprised by Asylums
* MonsterGirls did stellar
* NSFW tab as a whole seemed to do well, I don't venture there at all so idk why
* Wonder why Aww and Witches didn't seem to gain as many subscribers as usual
* Designs and Blueprints might need to get culled

All told, we had a pretty great month with a huge amount of subs gaining over 100 subscribers! We have 27 subs under 1k subscribers, so let's try to get that down to 20 this month!",2016-03-02 00:33:00+00:00,d0k2mod,1.0,t3_48j8rl,4209.0,ImaginaryNetwork

3275,"# Random thoughts of mine while perusing this

* BestOf gaining 5k subscribers from ads is awesome!

* Dragons and Castles are both also benefiting hugely from ads

* Two of our newest subs, Hellscapes and MonsterGirls, are off to a great start

* 650k subscribers total including 31k new over the last month alone!

* Interesting to see that Starscapes overtook Battlefields, Battlefields has been in front for a while iirc

* Seems ITW lost a lot from the deleted accounts cull :/

* Azeroth has been gaining a lot recently thanks to Lol33's efforts in x-posting that

* Kinda surprising Beasts dropped so many spots, however that's probably just a testament to the great growth of the subs around it

* Runeterra was kicked out of the network

* For once, Politics didn't actually drop any spaces!

* Blueprints and Designs failing, no surprise there

* Valar's been doing awesome with Trolls this month

* Lovers seems to have gained a lot as well

* Surprised to see Propaganda gaining so many

* Lol33's pets Portals and Weather gaining steadily

* Proud of my Marvel, tho I haven't really been doing much there as of late

* Airships keeps gaining and gaining

* Cybernetics, Elves, and Aliens doing wonderful

* Wow, Valar did great with Dieselpunk this month (still don't know what all the -punk subs are)

* Skyscapes has been finally picking up steam

* ICDT barely grew any due to the deleted accounts cull :/

* Westeros growth really cooling off (and just when I start to get into ASOIAF no less)

* Mindscapes, Leviathans, and Cityscapes (to a lesser extent) doing stellar as always

* Glad to see Behemoths slowly rising

* Maps doing great again :D

* Astronauts seems to have grown a ton this month due to Ethan :D

* Warhammer rising up as always due to Lev

Overall, I think we had an awesome month as the network continues to keep on growing!

P.S. Thanks for doing this Valar!",2016-02-02 00:46:10+00:00,czke47o,1.0,t3_43rmmj,558.0,ImaginaryNetwork

3540,"Not against the rules at all lol, otherwise you wouldn't find plenty of mods doing it all over reddit. It's not necessarily frowned upon either since admins have the final decision whether or not to unban the user when they are messaged. Notifying the user especially helps if they're a valid user (valid users have gotten shadowbanned a lot before) as they could become a valued member of the community after getting unbanned. 

Furthermore, shadowbans aren't supposed to be used on real users anymore. Legitimate users will only get banned through suspensions now (which they're notified about) so there's a big possibility /u/samk2824 got shadowbanned before suspensions were a thing. Since that could be the case, it's good to notify the user since they might be unaware of their ban and that's not supposed to happen to legitimate users under the new system.",2016-01-15 04:50:36+00:00,cyyvb86,4.0,t1_cyyutxv,932.0,adoptareddit

3684,"Is it official network business though? I'd love to be able to get the chance to meet our new mods and get to know them, but after an /r/needamod drive, it would be a bit annoying to come to our policy subreddit and have most of the first page be just introductions. Also, /r/ImaginaryChat would be perfect for this because basically what we'd be doing is chatting with our new mods. Furthermore, it's been agreed that it's useful to have AutoMod send a modmail when there's a new post, but after adding a bunch of mods, modmail would just get spammed with AutoMod notifications :/

I'm certainly not going to object to the entire proposal over this relatively small aspect of it, but I'd personally strongly prefer having these posts over at /r/ImaginaryChat. I like the idea of having them a lot, but I think it could grow to be kind of annoying when they're all posted at /r/ImaginaryNetwork.",2016-01-08 23:12:32+00:00,cyr7e5m,3.0,t1_cyqm9uv,30284.0,ImaginaryNetwork

I think it would be better to keep this sub mainly filled with Proposal/Results/Induction/Vote/Discussion threads, NSotW, and anything else that's directly about the going-one of our subs. 

I'm not necessarily opposed to it, but I'm kinda curious as to your reasoning on withholding invitation to /r/ImaginaryMods for a month.

Also, since you said in the other post that we still would allow /r/needamod recruitment drives, this proposal doesn't really affect those guys, does it (except for Step #4 of course)?

I should've said this to you a long time ago because you are just always stepping over the line and going way too far when someone looks at what you're doing as mod. It's obviously not up to you to decide whether your sub can contain NSFW content or not. Reddit as a whole does not ban NSFW content, so that clearly means that you cannot ban those types of posts in your own subs.

What you’re refering to as Android, is in fact, Android/Linux or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, Android plus Linux. Android is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning Linux system made useful by the Linux kernel, syscalls and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.
Many computer users run a modified version of the Linux system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of Linux which is widely used today is often called ""Android"", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the Linux system, developed by the Linux Foundation.

I give you a hamburger. The universe is engulfed within itself. A bus advertising hotdogs drives by a papillon. It disapproves. An unnatural force reverses Earth's gravity. You ask for a hamburger. I reciprocate with a mildly convulsing potato. You disapprove. Your disapproval releases a cosmic shift in the void between birth and life. You ask for a hamburger. A certain small dog feasts on hamburger patties for the rest of its unnatural, eternal endurance. Your constant disapproval sends silence through everything. A contrived beast becomes omnipotent. You ask for a hamburger. I give you a hamburger your body becomes an unsettled blob of nothingness, then divides by three. The papillon barks. The universe realigns itself. You, the papillon, and the hamburger disapprove. This condemnation stops the realignment. Hades freezes over. A pig is launched is launched into the unoccupied existence between space and time with a specific hamburger. You ask for a hamburger. I give you a hamburger. It screams as you lift it to your face. You laugh maniacally as I plead with you. You devour the hamburger as it pleads for mercy. I disapprove and condemn you to an eternity in a certain void where a certain pig and its specific hamburger are located. The Universal Space-time Continuum Committee disapproves of my irrational decision. You are locked away and are fed hamburgers for the rest of your natural existence. A pickle refuses to break down during the process of digestion. You die in a freak accident. A certain pickle lives the rest of its life in a comatose state. Your soul disapproves. Down the street a child cries as a hamburger gets stuck in, and climbs back up, her esophagus. You ask again for a hamburger. I refuse to reciprocate. You demand a lawyer. I remind you harshly that this is the new world order. Lawyers no longer exist. Only papillons. Your name is written on a list of sins. Blasphemy. You ask for a hamburger. The comatose pickle vanquishes your soul from this universe. Realignment occurs. You beg for a hamburger. A certain papillon's name is written on an obelisk in Egypt. Mumble. Peasants worship the obelisk. Your soulless corpse partakes in the festivity. Hamburgers are banned universally. The sun implodes. All planets cease to have ever existed. Mercury. Venus. Earth. Mars. Jupiter. Saturn. Uranus. Neptune. Pluto is the only mass in existence. Conveniently, you are on vacation here. Your need for hamburgers re-establishes space-time. Earth is recreated under your intergalactic rule. Hamburgers are your army. You wake up. Clowns. Clowns everywhere. Your dream rushes to meet you. You are kidnapped.

* Yay, BestOf pride! 14 spots up!

* A few big subs seem to be cooling down on growth: Wildlands, Aww, Witches, TurtleWorlds, Armor, Vehicles, Weaponry

* Fallout and Warhammer showing awesome growth again due to ads and Valar/Lev's awesomeness :D

* Westeros also having dismal growth this month (ugh, nothing we can do about this...) D:

* Valar also did well with Tamriel, that sub has grown a ton the past few months

* Azeroth has also been growing well lately with Lol33's x-posts to /r/wow

* Once again, very pleased with Hogwarts's growth :D

* Blueprints gained a few subscribers (I literally only found about that we had this sub yesterday)

* Lol33's right: 18k subs in half a month isn't shabby at all :D

* Landscapes tab having superb growth (as usual)

* Three subs gained less than 10 subscribers (guess which tab they're in)

* Seems like at least another five subs will reach 1k subscribers by next month :D 

* Awesome to see Pathways and Mythology up there!

Mainly, my opposition to this proposal boils down to this: this proposal is relatively small, it won't be a big change. However, this small change could have big harms. Your title says ""Prevent spam in the INE"" at the beginning, and I'm okay with it so far until I get to the second half of the title which says ""by denying posting privileges to new accounts/accounts with low karma."" This is a bit contradicting for me, because this proposed change would not only ""prevent spam,"" as it has the potential to prevent a lot more than that. It's the other stuff that it would prevent that causes me to oppose this. 

The current situation in Immortals is certainly not too hard to deal with manually, so I don't see why we should add something that would deal with it for us, especially since this could come back to bite us.",2015-12-01 05:02:39+00:00,cxitdup,7.0,t1_cxisz9o,777.0,ImaginaryNetwork

Alright, just make a vote thread within the next ten days.

&gt; Personally, I am against a high spam filter because in the rare case of a legit self post, I'd rather users not have to wait for a mod to approve their post.

We have high spam filters in all our subs anyway, it's just set to filter all in Immortals specifically :P

I don't honestly see this as too much of a problem seeing as we almost always have a few mods online. And also, even if it did take a while to approve, it's not like our subs get so many posts a day that their question/request will get pushed down a couple pages; it'll be visible on the front page of a sub for days after its original posting.",2015-12-01 03:20:01+00:00,cxips9r,3.0,t1_cxiplyg,272.0,ImaginaryNetwork

4147,"Sorry, I'm going to have to formally object to this proposal. Although we have had a lot of spam in /r/ImaginaryImmortals lately, it's nothing that can't be handled. Furthermore, the spam filter there has now been set to send all self-posts to the mod queue. This essentially solves the problem because we rarely get any non-spam self-posts on our subs, and even if we do get some in Immortals, it'll just be waiting in the mod queue for a mod to approve which can be easily done.

P.S. Now that there is a formal objection, you have two things you can do: you can either take it to a vote right now, or you can wait a little for more discussion before taking it to a vote.",2015-12-01 03:11:57+00:00,cxiph0m,1.0,t3_3uy1s8,984.0,ImaginaryNetwork

* The -punk subs except for Cyberpunk which Valar has been doing a great job with (don't know what any of these subs are, the Fandoms and Technology tabs have so many confusing subs)

* WorldEaters is a bit inactive, which is odd cause its subscriber count is better than most

* Werewolves would like some posts

* Races/Nature/Architecture have a lot of subs that would like some new posts

4250,"&gt; ""Uh what"" indeed. What am I supposed to make out of that.

Herein lies the problem. I think you might've misinterpreted this as something other than the clarifying question I believe it was meant to be. The user was not trying to disregard any of the time you spend here, albeit him asking for clarification could have been done in a more professional manner.

&gt; Alright, but I don't consider a one sentence ""Consider this a warning"", as particularly friendly. Seemed like more of a threat to possible ""further disciplinary action"", which kind of annoyed me because 1) I give a lot of my time to this forum, and 2) I've tried to cooperate with forum rules and suggestions (no more than 3 posts a day, flag NSFWs, and dig up titles for works I don't know by using google images).

I'm sorry if you construed that as a threat. I was merely stepping in because although you might have taken his response to you as insulting, your response was not appropriate and I then reminded you to be civil. I wasn't quite sure what to make of your reply back to me and I replied with a warning to you (hindsight is 20/20 goes the saying and it certainly holds true in this case).

&gt; Because I have computer skills, I've been able to obtain large sets of art. All totalled, this has taken many weeks, since successful harvesting requires some skills I didn't know previously and writing code to detect urls in the mishmash of downloaded pages and turn them into a shitload of wgets. Some of this art is very well documented. Some (and some very offbeat interesting stuff too) arrived ""as is"". I've personally gone through over 150,000 pictures, eyeballing each one for interest (my own and possible others). Doing this, I've culled my collection to perhaps 10,000. Each day I present three of these to reddit, hoping that they'll enjoy them as much as I do. (which is seldom the case, but 'c'est la vie': tastes varying especially where there's an age gap) I wrote further software, since I more fun than tedium, to automatically (except where g-image lookup is necessary) size, label and submit these pics to reddit, which required figuring out the Reddit API (which is about to change to something much more complicated and cumbersome). PS: I'm not trying for martyrdom here. I wanted to educated myself about Art and would have done the whole thing even if reddit didn't exist.

Wow, that's really interesting. It must've taken a ton of dedication to go through with that, I commend you for doing so. 

I'm glad we are having this talk though as you are a highly valued member of our community.",2015-11-23 04:17:29+00:00,cx9t6yl,11.0,t1_cx9s2dq,1994.0,ArtPorn

4308,"&gt; With subbreddits that have a lot of content overlap, do users migrate to the new sub while still posting in the old sub, or do they move over entirely?

In my experience, neither. We don't have any glaring content overlaps, but the small ones we do have don't have much to do with each other a lot of the time. For example, when Valar and I was promoting Marvel, we did little to no promotion in Mutants (an older sub). Maybe the occasional x-post and little sticky, but that's about it. We primarily x-posted outside the network and that's where the userbase mainly comes from, subs like /r/Marvel or /r/Daredevil. On the flip side, after Mutants got inducted a while back (over a year ago), most of its traffic has presumably originated from our dropdown menu. Pretty much no one from Mutants came over to Marvel.

I don't think you'll see any users migrating entirely from one sub to the other, cause there aren't any huge overlaps. If we had Marvel and Avengers, that'd be a problem cause most Marvel artwork is relating to the Avengers. But, as you'll probably find, we don't have any major overlaps of genres that clearly stick out.

Niche subs are the backbone of the network. Granted, lines have to be drawn, but I think we're a long way off from reaching those, especially with a broad sub like this.

#Random thoughts of mine while reading this:

* Oh hey, didn't realize Marvel had grown so much, and it's great to see BestOf and Animals up there too now.

* Airships did seriously great with NSotW and trending, probably the biggest boost ever as a result of NSotW.

* Ads for Witches and Jedi &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3

* Almost 9% growth, that's amazing!

* Aww also grew a lot even with ads ending early in the month

* Interiors seemed to grow a lot, think it was because of the /r/CozyPlaces x-post

* Mindscapes is still going strong!

* Disney and Hogwarts have been growing a lot more than usual in past months

* /u/LevTheRed is still doing awesome with Warhammer

* Fallout got a big bump with /u/VALAR_M0RGHUL1S

* Westeros growth is really cooling off :/

* Feels, Worlds, Azeroth, Immortals, Wizards, and Knights got pretty good bumps, dunno where from

* Lovers, Vessels, and Cowboys are definitely getting up there

* Poor, poor Jerk

* I never know what to post and where to promote Politics",2015-11-15 20:58:46+00:00,cx1a49q,1.0,t3_3sxpst,680.0,ImaginaryNetwork

4551,"Thank you for your submission! Unfortunately, it has been removed for the following reason(s):

* It does not include significant context in the title, such as the title of the artwork. The name you are looking for is ""Flowers"".

* It does not include significant context **in the title**, such as the name of the artist. The name you are looking for is ""Niko (SirKittenpaws)"".

* It is rehosted from [the original source](http://sirkittenpaws.deviantart.com/art/Flowers-566659319). You can submit any link if it is the original source, but rehosting services such as imgur should only be used when the original source is unknown or has been lost. You can use services such as Google Reverse Image Search and TinEye to find the original source.



Feel free to resubmit the image with proper context. If you have any questions, please [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FImaginaryAww). We apologize for the inconvenience.",2015-11-07 04:18:14+00:00,cwri1nj,1.0,t3_3rufx4,5543.0,ImaginaryAww

4596,"&gt; you're going to run in to problems involving the need to repost

We actually do allow reposts as long as the posts aren't in the top 100 of the subreddit, or if they have been posted within the last three months.

&gt; There are only so many imaginary starships out there. I'm not saying it would immediately be a problem, but there will eventually be a limit reached where between mods and regular posters, almost all OC is worn out in some places.

As you stated, I don't think this would be of any issue for a long long time (starships content [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=starships+deviantart&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS562US562&amp;es_sm=119&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAWoVChMI6tPq7v_1yAIVAe4mCh38yw8-&amp;biw=2560&amp;bih=1437&amp;dpr=0.75), [here](http://www.deviantart.com/tag/starships), [here](http://www.deviantart.com/tag/starship), [here](http://www.deviantart.com/tag/spaceship), [here](http://www.deviantart.com/browse/all/?q=spaceship), [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=spaceship&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS562US562&amp;es_sm=119&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAWoVChMIqMuU2YD2yAIVTDEmCh3LWQtZ&amp;biw=2560&amp;bih=1389&amp;dpr=0.75), etc) especially because this wouldn't result in a drastic increase in posts however I do think it might help. Another of my main reasons for proposing this is that it would hopefully increase the value of all the mods we have (we have over 50 juniors and counting!) in our smaller subs that need some love, because commenters in smaller subs don't matter as much as commenters in bigger subs so this would help our smaller subreddits get more active, and also get our mods more involved.

Is this a formal objection? If so, I will take this to a vote immediately.",2015-11-04 05:17:22+00:00,cwnugg4,2.0,t1_cwnu606,631.0,ImaginaryNetwork

4659,"Thank you for your submission! Unfortunately, it has been removed for the following reason(s):

* It does not include significant context in the title, such as the artist's real name (not their pseudonym). The name you are looking for is ""Sebastian Meyer"".

* It is rehosted from [the original source](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/percy-jackson-sea-of-monsters-charybdis-mouth-full-body). You can submit any link if it is the original source, but rehosting services such as imgur should only be used when the original source is unknown or has been lost. You can use services such as Google Reverse Image Search and TinEye to find the original source.

I requested [Deadpool and Snoo fighting for a chimichanga](https://www.reddit.com/r/ICanDrawThat/comments/3poaku/drawing_your_requests_on_live_stream_avansa_ep_7/cw893up), and [an upvote and downvote wrestling while Snoo looks on as ref](https://www.reddit.com/r/ICanDrawThat/comments/3peljw/drawing_your_requests_on_live_stream_avansa_ep_6/cw5w0fq).

x-post from /r/ImaginaryDisney (which I have a funny feeling you guys don't get much x-posts from in this sub)

**Here's an excerpt from the piece's description which I found interesting.**

Frollo has always been really scary to me, more so than any Disney villain with magic powers or frightening transformation abilities. Frollo's horror is realistic. He is a character we see played throughout history: the man who thinks his actions are sanctioned by God. This, in his mind, puts him above general law and allows greater travesties to be inflicted. I admire Disney for their darker films and their intrepid endeavors into the realm of evil, especially because these are kids' movies.
Frollo is not entirely evil, but that is not to say that he is a good man. He is deeply human, and animators Kathy Zielinski and Dominique Monféry took great care in bringing out the humanity in one of Disney's deepest characters. More than fear him, I pity Frollo. His behavior towards the church and towards human beings in general (Worst Father Award) makes me want to look into his past, how he was raised, and what twisted him and darkened him to the point where ""he saw corruption everywhere except within."" His uncertainty is captured well during more vulnerable moments, like his surprise when Esmeralda rips away from him in the church, and his helpless yearning towards her during the Festival of Fools when she wraps her scarf around him and draws him intimately close. He is a very layered character, and the animators captured this beautifully.
However, this does not take from his demonic portrayal at the very end. His ""transformation,"" as far as lighting and staging goes, is enjoyable to watch as he moves like a predator and, very clearly, believes himself to be a vengeful angel and in the right. He had, until this point, worn a guise of justice, and is finally revealed as the creature he is at the end. This is not to disprove my earlier point about his humanity, but just to say that we are all, in fact, creatures. He can be man, demon, and beast, and at every turn, we, as viewers, believe him.
Frollo's multiple layers are visually represented by his many robes and, even in his most personal moments by the fireplace, he is covered in clothing. Throughout the film, we don't even see an elbow; just hands, a face, and half a neck. Even in the audience's most intimate moments with him, he suffocates himself in layers, and the tragic hero traits he possesses in Victor Hugo's novel The Hunchback of Notre Dame are more prevalent, although very clearly he was painted as a villain for the Disney interpretation.
Needless to say, Judge Claude Frollo has been, and always will be, my favorite Disney villain.",2015-08-21 22:54:45+00:00,cub7xg6,1.0,t3_3hwnva,54.0,ImaginaryHorrors

5615,"**Here's an excerpt from the piece's description that I found interesting:**

Frollo has always been really scary to me, more so than any Disney villain with magic powers or frightening transformation abilities. Frollo's horror is realistic. He is a character we see played throughout history: the man who thinks his actions are sanctioned by God. This, in his mind, puts him above general law and allows greater travesties to be inflicted. I admire Disney for their darker films and their intrepid endeavors into the realm of evil, especially because these are kids' movies.

Frollo is not entirely evil, but that is not to say that he is a good man. He is deeply human, and animators Kathy Zielinski and Dominique Monféry took great care in bringing out the humanity in one of Disney's deepest characters. More than fear him, I pity Frollo. His behavior towards the church and towards human beings in general (Worst Father Award) makes me want to look into his past, how he was raised, and what twisted him and darkened him to the point where ""he saw corruption everywhere except within."" His uncertainty is captured well during more vulnerable moments, like his surprise when Esmeralda rips away from him in the church, and his helpless yearning towards her during the Festival of Fools when she wraps her scarf around him and draws him intimately close. He is a very layered character, and the animators captured this beautifully.

However, this does not take from his demonic portrayal at the very end. His ""transformation,"" as far as lighting and staging goes, is enjoyable to watch as he moves like a predator and, very clearly, believes himself to be a vengeful angel and in the right. He had, until this point, worn a guise of justice, and is finally revealed as the creature he is at the end. This is not to disprove my earlier point about his humanity, but just to say that we are all, in fact, creatures. He can be man, demon, and beast, and at every turn, we, as viewers, believe him.

Frollo's multiple layers are visually represented by his many robes and, even in his most personal moments by the fireplace, he is covered in clothing. Throughout the film, we don't even see an elbow; just hands, a face, and half a neck. Even in the audience's most intimate moments with him, he suffocates himself in layers, and the tragic hero traits he possesses in Victor Hugo's novel The Hunchback of Notre Dame are more prevalent, although very clearly he was painted as a villain for the Disney interpretation.

Needless to say, Judge Claude Frollo has been, and always will be, my favorite Disney villain.",2015-08-12 20:38:27+00:00,cu0t5wj,1.0,t3_3grmdv,226.0,ImaginaryDisney

5727,"Hi there! I'd love to be a mod here primarily focusing on the comments section. Below are my answers to your questions:

&gt; 1) What timezone are you currently in, and when do you think you'd be able to be active on reddit moderating?

I'm in the PST timezone and can be online and moderating anytime from 6 AM to 2 AM PST. I'm usually on however for about eight hours a day (most or all of which could be spent modding), but that number can certainly get higher if need be.

&gt;  2) Why do you want to moderate /r/Space?

I would like to moderate /r/Space for a couple of reasons. I've been a longtime subscriber/lurker and I've witnessed the community firsthand, which I'd love to be a part of. Like most people, I am enamored with space and modding the main subreddit about it would be an awesome chance to not only make a difference in the sub, but it could also be a huge learning experience that I would certainly cherish. This is made even better because you guys are looking for a comments section mod, and that would definitely be the best place to be able to communicate with users!

&gt;  3) Which rule would you change about /r/Space if you could and why?

I would tweak the rule about reposts a bit. Instead, I would change it to no reposting anything that is in the top 100 or has been posted in the last three months.

&gt;  4) Do you have any previous experience moderating a subreddit? (Not a requirement, but if you do just say which subreddits you moderated)

I moderate 20+ subs in the Imaginary Network: Expanded where my primary duty is to submit content and promote the subreddits. After only one month in the network, I was promoted to the second highest position there which I believe is a testament to how dedicated I am with the subs I mod and the work I put in. Another sub I mod is /r/AncientCivilizations where I am a general moderator (sort of what you guys are looking for here) and I carefully go through each submission and comment, making sure nothing breaks the rules and flairing every post; I have the same role in /r/whatissnoodoing in addition to being one of the main wiki mods there. I also fight a constant amount of spam in /r/antman, /r/DanielRadcliffe, and a few other Marvel subs. The biggest subreddit I mod is /r/bookporn. EDIT as of 8/18/15: I now moderate a collective userbase of well over 200k.

&gt;  5) If you were in the middle of one of reddit's infamous mod witch-hunts, how would you handle the situation? What steps (if any) would you take to mitigate the damage or fall-out and placate the user base?

Oooh, good question. The specifics of what I would do would of course depend on exactly what's going on, but first and foremost, my prime focus here would be communication, both with my fellow mods and the users. There is no subreddit without the subscribers, so I would adhere to their wishes, even if that means stepping down. Nuking all the comments won't solve anything because that would only serve to antagonize the users. I would only delete the comments if they were a blatant violation of sitewide and subreddit rules in which case I would ban them as well. I would be sure to try and keep an active communication line with the admins here as well. If bad turned to worse, I would delete my account if it came to that, but I doubt it would. The community here at /r/space does not seem at all like it would witch-hunt, and if I am chosen to be modded here, I would make sure it stays like that.

Anyway, thank you for your consideration!",2015-07-31 22:56:58+00:00,ctnd4u8,1.0,t3_3f4x4p,140670.0,space

Some of my hobbies include reading, hiking, bicycling, swimming, learning trivia, and collecting various objects.
