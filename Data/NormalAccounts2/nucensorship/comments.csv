1,"The bot was dead for a month and nobody said ""boo!"" :(

I'm really busy up until the end of the year, so unless someone hands me a fixed bot on a silver platter (which I know is unlikely!), not much will happen until then ...

I shall have to paste it when I get home, I don't have a copy here.

6,"That creates an unusual problem in this sub in particular.

I am a bot that documents mod actions here and posts actions to the subreddit /r/uncensorship.

Submissions removed by a mod, including AutoModerator, are automatically posted to /r/uncensorship. This shifts the spam problem into that sub.

A solution which prevents spammy submissions being posted at all is preferable to me.

10,"Thanks for the suggestion.

I've done this now, I hope that fixes the problem.

I'm not really a proper mod here, but it seemed like a bit of an emergency, so I have disabled text posts.

11,"one way to address this issue if you are concerned is for you yourself to become a mod of /r/uncensorship, so that you can remove PI from both subs at once.

message modmail at /r/uncensorship if you wish to discuss thing.
