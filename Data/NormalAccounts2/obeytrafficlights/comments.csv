The reflections are missing and also shadows are occasionally missing, but when they are rendered, are often done pretty well, only having some smaller artifacts (see 3:30 but also note that ass ugly car rendering). A few frames get dropped here and there already before 3:44, which is hard to believe considering the low resolution here, but i guess it is a console?? so...yeah, actually thats pretty terrible. I will admit that there is some kinda animation to the boxes which seem to splinter when shot at 4:53, but it isnt really a dynamic, destructible object, just a contextual bullet mark. love that absolutely shit body shot/blood animation at 5:00. someone should be fired for that, but at least peters character has some facial mapping that is responding the the hit, though a few frames seemed to be lost again or the death animation is just done poorly. At 5:30, again we see poor rendering, no dynamic lighting, some missing shadows. after 6:00 we see that again, no reflections are actually reflecting anything in the game, not even the skybox.

""Bernie supporters were still there in full force with an actual majority of delegates and they tried the opposite tactic. Before everyone was in the door (and while sanders supporters were largely not in the room yet) they did a survey and decided that Hillary had a 2/3 majority. Based on that majority they voted to change the rules and give Hillary her points back from the first round, and then they ignored the sanders supporters calls for a recount until the end of the convention when the chair person threw down the mic, stormed off, and told everyone they would be arrested for trespassing if they stayed.""

1174,"This is about all future presidencies. I cant say that trump is corrupt like hillary is. She is totally beholden to corporate interests AND she will drag us into another war or two, for sure. She has cheated and bent every possible rule and procedure to get her the delegates she has (I can not believe how badly exit polls and tallies mismatch, how polling stations are closed or suddenly moved in key districts) Or that she and the DNC had nothing to do with voters disenfranchised- yes, I too had my records ""lost"" and she is part of a corrupt network to whom she is politically beholden for the rest. Her record as a senator was actually pretty poor and her time as sec of state was a complete joke- either being fluff pieces or actual bad decisions. TRUMP is not a good person, he is a mean, brutally honest, ass, BUT he has some real points. The republican party needs total reform, and he is (may have already) accomplishing this. The democratic nomination process is so corrupt, even the republicans say it (!)  and probably the general election will be biased also. REFORM is needed and only bernie and trump are for it. transparency is needed.  This is america, we didnt invent democracy and free will, we perfected it- only to somehow end up here...so sad. Trump is for some downright questionable things, mass deportations and anti-muslim approaches- I hate it, it is wrong, but maybe it would save us...i honestly dont know. i think it is just as likely to enrage even more people to attack us.  Trump will pull some downright uncool shit- he will probably nominate his daughter to be the next supreme court justice....and it will somehow get approved. oh well. you might not like him, but his actions are predictable, which is also a kind of honesty.

Obama said, “Senator Clinton in her campaign has been for NAFTA previously, now she’s against it.”
Obama is partly right concerning the North American Free Trade Agreement. Clinton’s views on NAFTA have shifted, but they shifted prior to her official run for the White House. Back in 1998, in a keynote speech given at the Davos Economic Summit, Clinton praised business leaders for mounting “a very effective business effort in the US on behalf of NAFTA,“ adding later that ”it is certainly clear that we have not by any means finished the job that has begun.“ But by 2005 she was expressing reservations about free trade agreements, voting that year against the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA). And she told Bloomberg News in March 2007 that, while she still believes in free trade, she supports a freeze on new trade agreements--something she calls ”a little time-out.“

1789,"FYI: Legend is that they were defeated by an enemy tribe and forced to flee into the Asaro River. They waited until dusk before attempting to escape. The enemy saw them rise from the muddy banks covered in mud and thought they were spirits. Most tribes in Papua New Guinea are very afraid of spirits, so the enemy fled in fear, and the Asaro escaped.  

They then went into the village to see what had happened, not knowing the enemy tribesmen were still there. The enemy were so terrified they ran back to their village and held a special ceremony to ward off the spirits.
The mudmen could not cover their faces because legends say that the people of Papua New Guinea thought that the mud from the Asaro river was poisonous. So instead of covering their faces with this alleged poison, they made masks from pebbles that they heated and water from the waterfall.  

The masks have unusual designs, such as long or very short ears either going down to the chin or sticking up at the top, long joined eyebrows attached to the top of the ears, horns and sideways mouths.
