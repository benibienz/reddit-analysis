-One of the clinton stickers *might* have actually said ""clinton for prison, not 100% sure, hense the +1/-1, but i suppose that libertarian voters could also have such a sticker.  

One trump sticker I didnt count actually said ""Make america Build again"" and was fashioned to look like a trump ad, but didnt explicitly state it- so could actually be +1 more (12 total)  
Methods:drove 9 hours across parts of Florida and counted every car with a sticker. I did not count bernie stickers, though they were also present.
