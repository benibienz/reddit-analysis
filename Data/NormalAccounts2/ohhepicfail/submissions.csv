Opened it up occasionally to stir and once it was hot, I grabbed the hot pads and went to pull it off the stove. The bottom of the pot stayed on the burner and chili went everywhere. 

Tl;dr heated chili on the stove in a crockpot and the pot broke

I'm also getting very quiet sound from the draw 2 hole. It was playing fine yesterday and today started this. 

I just got this one a couple days ago since my first was a Bb and I couldn't play along with videos to learn since most use key of c. 

If I rapidly draw in and out, as recommended on a site when I googled the issue, the sound comes back a little but once I resume normal playing it goes right back. I've also tapped moisture out and it's not made a difference. I don't want to mess with it too much for fear of messing it up.
