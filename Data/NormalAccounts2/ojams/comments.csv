103,"ECU's are coded to only work with the car they were paired with from the factory, not specifically for that reason but the key, cluster, and ecu are all paired to prevent theft. So to swap a second ecu you would have to pay someone to disable the immobilizer on the ecu, so either way it'll show up as modified. Also have you ever swapped an ecu? It's a pita, you have to remove your wiper arms and the cowl and you'll cut up your hands because its really tight in there and the metal is sharp. The cowl is really thin plastic so that'll start cracking from being removed a lot and will leak water into your car, also the connectors on the ecu have gaskets and stuff in order to keep water out and I'm sure those will get worn or damaged as well from removing and replacing many times. So, no I don't think it'll work
  
Edit: And your warranty isn't automatically voided from modifications, only the part thats directly affected by the modification can be voided. For example they can't deny you warranty if you have aftermarket wheels and your turbo goes bad. Although an ecu tune could technically affect anything in your drivetrain (motor, trans, turbo, etc) it really depends on the dealer",2016-09-26 01:38:24+00:00,d823ecf,1.0,t3_54i4kz,2723.0,GolfGTI

Generally the 2.5's are pretty reliable, the main issues are the vacuum pump failing and leaking oil (look it up on the forums if you need help seeing what it looks like) and the transmission might have problems if the oil isn't changed every 40-60k, but that's a weird issue because some people have no problems and never service the tranny while others have problems right away, and i think 140k miles is enough time that if the tranny was gonna fail it would have shown signs by now, since it usually happens early on. I know you want to look for one that's 2008 or newer as well because the earlier engines have chain tensioner issues which is no bueno for your motor plus the 08+ have 180hp while the 05-07 have 140hp so that's a fun bonus.
