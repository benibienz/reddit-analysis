I'm posting today to ask for some opinions. My job involves a lot of driving for most of the day and usually I don't have much time to stop except for gas, so when I stop for gas I go to the bathroom there and get my food there. If they have a restaurant type thing at the gas station thats what I'll eat, but most of the time it's whatever's available in the snack isles that I can eat while driving. So my question to you is, what are the healthiest (relatively speaking) and cheapest foods and drinks one can find at most gas stations? Also what are some things that are low in nutritional value that I can eat a lot of and for hours without hurting my teeth or growing a belly?",EatCheapAndHealthy,(Opinions) Traveling diet,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/45skbn/opinions_traveling_diet/
