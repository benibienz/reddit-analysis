I can't imagine the numbers of viewers that are slowly leaving, or worse, the new users that have tuned in the last few months to a still OK, but not very engaging or dynamic show.  I used to watch LAS for Linux information, but also for entertainment,  because it used to be fun.  I miss Matt as the straight man to Chris' enthusiasm, or even Bryan's levity to Chris' practical approach to Linux and the community.  The human element is missing without video....there really is something missing.  Although the video at the time they changed did look terrible.  I think they just need a local host that can go on camera with Chris, and maybe have Noah do special segments like Matt used to do.  As I understand, there was a bandwidth issue, but there is also a content issue.  The audience wants more distro and community news, more how to's not specific to Noah's interest, and interviews like the ones they did with the Fedora developers.  I really felt the community aspect of the show during that series.  JB is for geeks (I say that lovingly), stick to geek subjects, no RV/Camping shows.  LAS has given this community so much, I don't think it would be unreasonable for LAS to reach out to the community for ideas and help.  It will respond.  Hell, I remember sending cash-$ to Bryan and his family when he asked for help on-air.  But in the end JB is a business and they should listen to their customers, as fickle as we are, and as much as we don't give due credit to the hard working folks at JB.  It might be time to bite the bullet and go with more corporate sponsorship, improve the cash flow and quality of the production.  I admire those that believe in the Patreon philosophy, but a man's gotta eat and pay the bills, and how much would it really degrade the integrity of LAS?

160,"To Linux Action Show Staff:  As the poster of the comment that generated the whole video quality on LAS controversy, I have to say thank you.  In my original post ""Thank You"" was a comment I regrettably left out, an over-site that LAS fans rightly reminded me of through some really creative post :).  There are few shows, or communities for that matter, that can hear fan feedback and wham! Things get fixed the very next week.  So, at the very least I owe the LAS team some feedback:

1. LAS looks very professional and is back to LAS standards I love to show to new Linux users.  I should say that I have 5 Linux coverts this year, and am responsible for getting my workplace to adopt Linux for a critical function within our organization.
2. I am one of your ""mostly video"" consumers,  and appreciate the Linux Unplugged type format.
3. The sound is amazing. At least in the HD video.
4. As the first version of the new format this was exceptional in quality and content.
5. Noah does sound more relaxed off camera
6. I hope the new format leads to less stress in Chris' life.  I felt terrible last week thinking I had caused more stress to an obviously hard working father.

Thanks for the shows LAS team!  Hoping to get my Linux Unplugged shirt before I go on my next business trip!

166,"Not really much constructive feedback here.  My observation was not meant to merely criticize the show, it was to drive a discussion that could help improve the show, because I love it and want it to be its best in all aspects - and that includes video quality.  Nobody here has said that it doesn't look worse than before, I think everybody agrees on that.  The content is much better with Noah in my opinion, and I do respect Noah's integrity; but sorry to say the video production is not up to past quality standards.  If it is the internet connection like q5sys says, and not the choice of video and software production tools, then I apologize for my misunderstanding.  One question: how is it that videos from the Red Hat summit look world class? What video production tools are they using?  If any organization is using Linux video production tools it would be them.  Or, do they compromise for the sake of producing high quality videos, even as one of Linux's champions?",2015-08-03 19:02:33+00:00,ctq76gh,1,t3_3fltzx,29663,LinuxActionShow
