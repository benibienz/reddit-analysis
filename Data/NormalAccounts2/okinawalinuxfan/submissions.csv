An everyday linux-box running RHEL 7.2? Well...yes, with the caveat that this is the right system setup for me. I do understand that this will not be the ideal setup for most people. I should say that I did try other distributions and variants, particularly Ubuntu-MATE 16.04. I was hugely impressed with the polish the Ubuntu-MATE team put into their latest release; but the back-end Ubuntu-base bugs and current Network Manager problems were inexcusable IMO. Not the Ubuntu-MATE folks fault I should point out.

I know, I know....distros other than RHEL 7 provide a far wider selection of applications..I got it. In my case everything I needed (other than a flexible media player), was in the RHEL 7 and EPEL repositories ready for easy and reliable installation and use.

Enable EPEL: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL - look for appropriate RPM / Right-click / Install with Software Install See repo-list in Terminal: yum -v repolist See only enabled repos: yum repolist enabled

Also, before you reply, “but you have to pay for updates!”. I know, but $49.00 for a self-support subscription is very reasonable and the equivalent to buying a pair of pants or a night out with a few drinks. Even though I have a self-support contract I have been helped by Red Hat engineers time and time again, and I can say it is the best support for ANY service that I have received. Also, I see the selection of RHEL 7 as an alternative to all OSes to include Windows 10 and MAC OSX. Compared to these systems RHEL is a downright bargain.

Priority of requirements for distribution selection:

1) Distro stability

2) Distro security

3) Application requirements based on my use profile below.

4) Ease of use (or simplicity/KISS principle) – Does it just work everytime.

5) Distro documentation and support

6) FOSS community support



Computer profile: Essentially, a very stable and reasonably secure internet and media client. Also, native OpenVPN and bit-torrent support.

Use profile: I needed this machine to do the following – reliably and securely.

1) Internet client, with reasonable security and functionality. Solution: Firefox with HTTPS Everywhere and Ublock Origin plugins. Chrome requires 3rd party repositories to meet dependencies, so it was not an option for me.

2) Media client that can play all standard formats. MPEG2, MPEG4part2, DivX 3.11 Alpha ;-). H264, MP3, AAC , LPCM, Dolby Digital, iLBC, ADPCM, and FLAC. Solution: Fluendo ONEPLAY Player is a paid ($35.00) software application that delivers high quality playback of movies, TV shows and web video clips across for the most popular formats, including AVI, H265, H264, and MPEG4, Windows Media, and more. I tried alternate repositories for VLC, but in the end went with the solution that just worked and didn't require questionable 3rd party repositories.

3) Support for VPN with OpenVPN and bit-torrent support. Solution: As admin: yum install openvpn and install Transmission client for torrents

4) Robust security software and support. I travel for a living and regularly have to connect to hotel wired and WiFi internet nodes. Solution: Install clamav, clamav-update and rkhunter. Set firewall to “Public” profile. Do not turn off SELinux, I have had 0 conflicts with SELinux in it's standard configuration. Check status with command: sestatus

You should see something like this:

SELinux status: enabled

SELinuxfs mount: /sys/fs/selinux

SELinux root directory: /etc/selinux

Loaded policy name: targeted

Current mode: enforcing

Mode from config file: enforcing

Policy MLS status: enabled

Install the Red Hat Insights Client and Register Up to 10 Systems for Free with your RHEL subscription

I am not a a sys-admin or a computer security specialist so I welcome your input when it comes to configuration and security. Please research your own security requirements and configuration, don't rely on my configuration for your security needs. I should also say, I do not run as admin, I use a standard account and log into admin/root for administrative requirements only.

For some time I have been trying to run Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 on my daily machine.  Most of that time was trying to get non-free codecs or VLC installed.  I've tried 3rd party repositories, but all failed me in some way or another.  With a few I was in missing-dependency-hell, others didn't have RHEL 7 repositories, and a few were completely off-line.   Needless to say, there were no reliable solutions that I trusted.  I know, I know, there are those of you that are asking yourself ""WTF, why would anyone want to run RHEL 7 as a daily machine?""  The only answers that I can give is that it was a challenge I had to overcome, and that I respect the integrity of Red Hat as an advocate for Linux in the enterprise.  There are also some security requirements that I had to fill, and RHEL 7 fit the bill nicely. 

OK, so enough with the back-story.  The solution is NOT free, but it does work perfectly if you require non-free codecs in a Linux distro that does not support non-free packages.  I just installed Fluendo Oneplay and it works perfectly, and was very easy to install. I don't mind having to pay if there is no reliable free solution.  There is a 30 day trial at the link below.

http://www.oneplaydirect.com/oneplay/oneplay-player/

I hope this helps someone, Its a very easy solution, and might keep another Linux user from the frustration I felt dealing with shady 3rd party repositories.  BTW, I am extremely happy with RHEL 7, it makes an awesome reliable daily machine.

I know its a Linux solution, but the quality of the show, which used to look so good now looks unprofessional.  Sorry to have to say it, but it is a fact.  I tried to get a friend who is new to Linux to watch the show,and that was his first comment.  When I see videos like this on YouTube I immediately switch to another video.  The Linux Action Show is so well produced, why drag the production quality back 10 years?  I think the Free Software Crusade has drifted a little too far into the ""Stallman"" dimension.  Like to hear what other viewers think.  One last thing, why does Chris look so good?  If you are not going full Linux in production, why go half way at the expense of the show?
