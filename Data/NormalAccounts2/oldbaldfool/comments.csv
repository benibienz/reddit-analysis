88,"From the wiki of the second inquiry:

The report concluded that an **Official IRA sniper fired on British soldiers**, albeit that on the balance of evidence his shot was fired after the Army shots that wounded Damien Donaghey and John Johnston. The Inquiry rejected the sniper's account that this shot had been made in reprisal, stating the view that he and another Official IRA member had already been in position, and the shot had probably been fired simply because the opportunity had presented itself. Ultimately the Saville Inquiry was inconclusive on **Martin McGuinness' role, due to a lack of certainty over his movements, concluding that while he was ""engaged in paramilitary activity"" during Bloody Sunday, and had probably been armed with a Thompson submachine gun**, there was insufficient evidence to make any finding other than they were ""sure that he did not engage in any activity that provided any of the soldiers with any justification for opening fire"".

177,"Went from Nexus 5 to S7 (not the edge). I still have my beautiful N5 and use it to see the latest updates etc from Google. I was very disappointed with the Nexus phones after N5 and several factors convinced me to get the S7. Why you should buy the S7:
Wireless charging - I know for many people this is not important, but I used it on my N4 and N5 and became accustomed to the convenience. Storage - SD cards are getting cheaper all the time and not having to worry about how many photos you take or how much music is on your phone  is great. The camera - I am sure you have seen posts about the S7's camera, it is fantastic. The build quality - it is an extremely well made device, I like the design and handfeel (I don't think that is a word). This is the first Samsung phone I have owned, I have the Galaxy Nexus but I don't count that as a Samsung device.  You will have also heard negative comments about TouchWiz. TouchWiz is good, I always was a stock Android fanboy - not any more. Obviously, Gmail, Gmaps, YouTube and calendar are good stock apps and I use them. However, I use the Samsung browser, S Health and Gallery as I find the are better on the S7. You just choose the app the suits you best. I am sure S Planner is a good app but I prefer Google Calendar.
TLDR: Buy a Samsung S7 (the edge doesn't have good handfeel IMO).",2016-08-07 18:39:04+00:00,d681seg,1.0,t3_4wi7jx,71193.0,GalaxyS7

If Samsung attempts this, they better not make the mistakes Microsoft made with their phones.

I decided to try Windows as the Android phones with the features I wanted were too expensive. A bit of research led me to the Lumia 830, metal frame, SD card, wireless charging - the hardware is fantastic. The software is a huge disappointment. I had expected there to be differences of course, that was part of the excitement - learning about new software. However, the software the phone came with (8.1, I think) was a mess, even opening the settings menu was an affront to my eyeballs. I wanted to wait for the OTA upgrade to W10, but it always seemed to be a shimmering mirage - offering to be there - then disappearing into the 'coming soon' mist. So, I am now on the latest insider build of W10. This is the worst software I have used on a phone - Cupcake, Donut, Eclair, Froyo, Gingerbread, Honeycomb (on my Asus TF101), Ice Cream Sandwich, Jellybean, KitKat, Marshmallow - every update of Android has been better than my experience of W10.

Expandable storage is important for some people. My Nexus phones (Galaxy, 4, 5) didn't have it so I don't miss it. However, having a SD card filled with music and easily swapable is fantastic on my ASUS 5.
Nexus phones (for me) have never been cheap or easily available (usually involving grey imports or friends buying when overseas.
I have never even seen a Nexus 6 (Google/Moto messed up the oversea sales).
I bought Nexus phones regardless of their limitations because I believed they were the best combinations of device/software. I no longer think that is true. Software is very quickly becoming a Pepsi/Coke type of argument and hardware is chosen by what you personally like/feels best. 
I am sad that the Nexus 5 will probably be the last Nexus I will buy, But I look forward with boyish excitement to learning all the ins and out of a new mobile system.

Down the length of the room concrete pillars supported the ceiling. However, not all the pillars served this purpose: for there were others, too.

They were perforated at regular intervals and inside them a spiral ran from top to bottom in order to ensure as even a distribution of the granular crystals as possible. Mounted on the ceiling was a large number of dummy showers made of metal. These were intended to delude the suspicious on entering the gas chamber into believing that they were in a shower-room.

The S6 is already in the same cost zone as Apple phones, so take cost out of the equation and Apple marketing/brainwashing takes over.
