241,"Basically you join a lobby, the host will shuffle players and the 2 players at the top will be the hosts. They add each other, and invite all players respectively to a party. They then leave the lobby and the 2 hosts agree on a very specific server/preferences and queue at the same time. Each round will consist of 2 games. They call it RAD Rules, Radiant win first, Dire win next game. Dire would ask all Radiant heroes  about their quests and help them fulfill these, e.g. 3 double kills. Usually the winning team of the game would pick a prophet and the losing team would feed the prophet unti he has desolator/necronomicon. Once quests are complete, the winning team signals the losing team and the prophet is fat enough to finish the game in 1 push. Rinse and repeat.
