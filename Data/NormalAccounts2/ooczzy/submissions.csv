I posted the guide here for those interested
https://www.reddit.com/r/ClashRoyale/comments/4fdbu7/deck_a4_a6_triple_spell_deck/

It's a purely reactive deck that deals **especially well vs spawners and defenses** because of Poison spell. (You don't lose much from sitting on 10 elixir, just as long as you play your counters right.)

Arrows - lvl 6 (From donations)

I'm goint to share a deck I used to wiggle out of the A4 hole and made it to almost A7. This is a counter deck and should not be used as an offensive deck 90% of the time.

Cards:
Hog, Freeze, Poison, Arrows, Cannon, Skeleton Army, Spear Goblins, Musketeer.

How to use the Deck:
Wait for an opponent to deploy. Ideally, you would want to have the poison or the cannon as your starter. DO NOT make the first move. 

Counter different pushes: 


**Early Game**

Opponent places a tank behind his king and lets it walk down the lane, placing units behind it - Place cannon in the middle to distract tank and place poison just as the tank crosses the bridge. If necessary, drop Spear Goblins to distract troops to keep them within Poison.

*Opponent places tower/defensive building - drop Poison on the building as well as their crown tower, and ready yourself for a counter attack.

*Incoming Hog/Loon/Freeze - Place Cannon in the middle to distract, usually Crown Tower + Cannon is enough to kill a Hog. If he freezes, you can either counter Freeze or drop Skelly Army if it's a Hog, Spear Goblins for Loons. If he commits arrows, counter push with your own Hog.

*Spawner Decks - If he only places 1, just place the cannon in the center, slightly skewed to the lane with the hut. If he places 2, apply poison on both AND the Crown Tower, as well as place a Cannon in the middle skewed towards the lane. If he commits with a heavy push with Barbs/Pekka/Prince/Minion Horde/Wizard/Witch etc., drop BOTH Poison and Freeze. If it's not too heavy, just place a Musketeer beside the crown tower for cover fire.



**Double Elixir**

Apply the basic concepts mentioned at the top BUT always try to have either Poison or Freeze up at any point in time. If you really need to use both, quickly cycle through to have the next one ready to go.

When you manage to gain an elixir advantage (e.g. heavy commit stopped by a Poison or Skelly Army), immediately ready Hog Freeze just before enemy push is about to die. Usually this catches them off Guard. A good trick is to pre-fire arrows when the Hog is about to reach the tower or cast Poison then Freeze to stop any possible defending troops from being deployed. He either chooses to allow free damage or commits troops onto the pre-fired arrows or Poison. If he chooses to split push, just ready Cannon and your remaining cards. 3 times out of 4 you win trades.

Basically I can't narrow down every specific situation but you get the feel of the deck once you use it.",ClashRoyale,[Deck] A4 - A6 Triple Spell Deck,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClashRoyale/comments/4fdbu7/deck_a4_a6_triple_spell_deck/

**Firecracker Stall** - costs 4 elixir. Rapidly fires waves of 5 firecrackers at a time in an area that hits both ground and air units.

I was minding my own business when my cat went and started scratching the screen windows. I pulled her away, when i turned around the window had slid open and a roach got inside the living room. Now keep in mind this happened roughly 20 minutes ago, it's 5 AM here. Being the alpha male of the home, I had to assert my dominance. I did what any man would do. I grabbed a broom, stared the roach face-to-face, it flexed it wings, i went to wake my girlfriend up. She got mad and pointed me a can of bug spray. I could tell she was using rage to hide her fear, even if she didn't say anything. So I let her go back to sleep peacefully, knowing full well I am doing her a favor. Now when I came back to the living room, the roach was right in front of an immovable cabinet. I inched closer and estimated the distance between us. I sprayed in its general direction, distance between the can and the roach was roughly a meter. I'd like to believe it inhaled the fumes because it started darting in circles. I was afraid it was going to fly, so I waited it out. For about 30 seconds it ran from corner to corner while rubbing its face. I felt it got dizzy so I inched closer for the finisher. I sprayed from about the same distance as before, and it ran directly below the cabinet. I'm afraid if i check it, it'll turn out to be alive and it'll eat my face off. It's been 20 minutes. It's either dead or alive. I can't go back to what I was doing because it might come crawling back out. How much is a lethal dose for roaches?

Back then when the Gleaming Seal first came out, I just spent 10$ and got to use it immediately. Now when a decent set comes out, 10$ on a compendium doesn't even guarantee that you get the set that you want.

Additionally, there will be 3 Majors PLUS TI.

What if on the 5th death he drops ""Gaze of the Accursed Prisoner""

This item is basically an invulnerable ward that grants vision of the target area just like any ward BUT it is does not have stealth and it provides clear vision. It disappears once Roshan respawns.

Basically the enemy team can still see the ward but they cannot destroy it. Thoughts?

EDIT: It expires when Aegis is reclaimed. This would balance it out a bit since the losing team would know if aegis has been reclaimed, sort of a minor compensation for having to deal with unobstructed vision from the team with the Gaze.
Also more than anything, vision wins games. On the 5th death the game would've been dragged out for quite a while.
