If you're open to trade I have a Boker Anti Grav or a Kershaw Volt SS which would def benefit from some ano.  Also, because I interested in it, I have put some thought to how ano effects the value. For myself, someone who was already thinking about picking one up, it would be a toss up for me to go brand new, $30 prime shipped, or pickup a used but customized one. For me the ano job adds value. because I would pay only $20 for a used jettison, but I would pay the same price as a new one, in this case, by my math, the ano adds 50% value to your used jettison.

595,"For me, I like to participate regularly but that can get hard to justify when the odds become less than 8-10% per entry. For me, I tend to get more excited at the chance to win a $75-$250 knife @ ~$10-$20 a spot. The only time I would participate in a $300+ raffle is if I am very drawn to the knife, and at that point I'd be looking for &gt;10% odds, so if that means buying 2 spots, I would. 

I think that expensive knives tend to appeal to a narrower group because they become more customized. So I would suggest running 2 raffles at a time, one that is, let's say &gt;$300-$500 and one for less. Just my two cents. ",2016-05-04 03:37:39+00:00,d2s0538,1.0,t3_4hs1xm,9729.0,Knife_Raffle
