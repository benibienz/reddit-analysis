I love Northwoods knives, and this is a great example. I love the size, the action, fit and finish. But... I just really prefer other handle materials. Wood, ivory, micarta. Mostly want to trade, looking at $250+ trade or $250 PayPal. I think this is reasonable for two reasons. 1. I would be happy to keep it. 2. They are selling on eBay for ~$250-~$350.

Just received a Kershaw Leek from a trade. It arrived with some play in the lockup. I took it to a big box store and used my interpersonal savvy to get it replaced with a brand new Leek. I took it out of its package, flipped it twice, and decided I'd rather have a Spyderco Roadie.

Never carry, time to go:

Kershaw Volt SS and SOG Twitch II. Not going to go into too much detail as these both are both typical examples. The Kershaw is in good cosmetic conditions, no scuffs, some spots on the blade, just needs a little TLC. The Twitch has some scuffs from a drop or two. Both never sharpened and still factory sharp. Both open nice and fast.

Make me an interesting offer, ideally trade both the SOG and Kershaw for 1 knife.

Doing some spring cleaning. All great knives, just no sentimental attachment, so I figured I'd see what's out there to trade. Would be willing to trade 1-1 or 3-1 or any combination really. All of the knives come as they are, no boxes or anything. They all have factory, very lightly used and sharp blades. 

Boker Plus Anti Grav - [Amazon listing ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004NS9PVK/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_.8TLxb963NNA2) . Was a gift, purchased new. Fly's open, super light. Lock up is good, but does have some side to side play. Trade value ~$35

TRADED! Kershaw Skyline [house of blades exclusive ](http://www.houseofblades.com/products/kershaw-skyline-orange-limited-edition-1760cktor-manual-knife.html) orange and black. Sharpest of the group. Acquired in a trade, cleaned it up inside and out. Everything you expect from a Skyline, including centering strongly favoring the presentation side. It currently grazes the scale. when I tighten down the frame screws, it doesn't rub, but after a day they loosen up. Kershaw recommended loc-tite, I just never bothered. Knife opens nicely even when grazing the scale, but opens a lot nicer when it's tighten up. Trade value ~$30 due to resolvable centering issue. 

Kershaw Volt SS - [Amazon listing ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007W1QCIY/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_OhULxbNB8E86J) - purchased here. Solid knife. Just doesn't get any pocket time. Opens and locks up hard. The blade has a slight slight ""patina"" to it, hardly noticeable but worth mentioning. Otherwise this really looks like new. Trade value ~$15

I've tried to represent these knives as accurately as possible, please do the same when making offers. Feel free to toss out any offers. Here are a few things I am interested in Slip joints!

Won this in a knife_raffle. It came back from a spa treatment before the raffle. A couple snap trails on the clip. It's gorgeous, super smooth action. For someone who isn't crazy about carbon fiber, this is really beautiful. I have always wanted a Large Sebenza, and that is what I am looking to trade for. Includes everything but the cleaning cloth. When I won the knife, it didn't include the lanyard and bead, I purchased it for $20 from CRK. Birthday of this knife is 8/28/14. I can get pictures of box and accessories tonight or tomorrow.
