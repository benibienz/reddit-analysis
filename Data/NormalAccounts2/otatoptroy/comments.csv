Neris was arguably the most valuable reliever available in the trade market, and I'm very glad I was able to get him.

365,"They really aren't similar cases at all though. Velasquez has a history as a highly touted prospect with the minor league stats to back it up, while Worley came out of nowhere. 

Worley's major league success was largely based on his running fastball, which got tons of called strikes, plus the deception in his delivery. However, hitters adjusted to that pitch, and stopped striking out looking to it, and Worley could never get the swinging strikes to survive. That's why he got obliterated after moving to the Twins, and is now nothing more than a long reliever.

Velasquez is entirely different. He put up monster k-rates throughout the minors because of his swing-and-miss stuff, and this year in the majors he has a 9.95 k/9, which is among the best in the bigs. Velasquez has an incredibly high ceiling; top ten starter potential. Worley's ceiling was never remotely close to that.",2016-07-30 16:59:06+00:00,d5xbi2t,2.0,t1_d5xafj1,1782.0,phillies

382,"If Hellickson turned down the QO, he might get stuck in the same position as Stephen Drew and Kendrys Morales (other Boras clients) once did, where nobody will even offer them a deal because of the first-round pick attached to them. Matt Wieters (also Boras) avoided this by accepting his QO this offseason.

Yovani Gallardo only got 2 years, 22M after turning down his QO last year. Gallardo had a better track record, though. Is 2/22, or less, really any better than 1/16? 

However, the more I think about this, the more likely it is that I think Hellickson turns down the qualifying offer. This year's free agent market is starved of any talent, while next year's is absolutely loaded. Hellickson would actually be one of the best starting pitchers on the market this offseason, competing with only Rich Hill, Doug Fister, and Brett Anderson. This offseason is Hellickson's best opportunity to lock up a multi-year deal, and in a class so weak, he could get significantly more than 2/22. I mean, shit, Ian Kennedy got 5/70, and he was garbage.

The Phillies might actually be hanging on to Hellickson - but I think I'm okay with that. Otherwise, we get a legitimate prospect for him. Either way, it looks like Hellickson is getting paaaaiiiid this winter.",2016-07-27 18:19:09+00:00,d5tahpc,3.0,t1_d5t91hz,1708.0,phillies

While he did just throw a two hitter, it was against a weak Oakland lineup with only 5 strikeouts. His first start against LAA (3k/3bb) doesn't inspire much confidence either.

Also, there's a good chance we pick up Ruiz's option for only 500k.

873,"Phils voter here:

After a 6-0 week, Phillies sit at 16. At 15-10, I don‚Äôt think their record is very legitimate. The pitching staff is very good, but young and volatile. They will face hurdles as the season goes on. Doesn‚Äôt help that Adam Morgan has to pitch now, either. Herrera has been an absolute monster, and Franco is a beast, but the rest of the lineup isn‚Äôt so spooky. BP‚Äôs 3rd Order Win Percent still has the Phillies below .500, so this is probably the highest spot the Phillies will rank all year, unless our top prospects (plus Altherr) come up later in the year and make an immediate impact. With all that being said, this is still an incredibly fun team with lots to watch for. Now, for the rest of the ranks.

Great week from the Mets has them soaring up two the two spot. Meanwhile, an abysmal week from the Dodgers knocks them to 6. At this point, their roster just doesn‚Äôt impress me like it did earlier in the year (although they are still sixth). Pirates and Cardinals nudge into the top 5.

White Sox are playing some great baseball, so they move up to 7. Red Sox make a huge jump from 17 up to 9 after sweeping the Yanks and winning three against Atlanta.

Orioles had a 3-4 week, but ended up going four spots forward to 8, because of the teams in front of them dropping back. We‚Äôll see how long this holds up, but they‚Äôve played well this year.
Had to drop the Blue Jays at this point. Still like the roster, but the results just haven‚Äôt been coming. Same with the Astros, who are down to 20. They are going to need some positive correction out of the pitching staff to climb back, or A.J. Reed.

Tigers make a huge jump up to 11, while the Mariners move up to 13. Both teams have good records, but I‚Äôm iffy on them going forward. I feel the same way about Texas, too, but they sit atop the AL Bleh, so they‚Äôll remain in the top 10 for now.

The stubborn Royals are finally knocked back to 12, although I suspect they may work their way back up. Stop outperforming projections, stay down there!

Marlins quietly had a great week, sweeping the Dodgers in a four game set and taking two of three from Milwaukee. Tough for me to keep them behind Philly, but the Dee suspension will hurt. On the plus side, Dietrich is free now.

For whatever reason, this felt like my most volatile week for rankings. I think part of that comes from a lot of teams either having great weeks or horrible weeks, but there was still a lot more change than there has been so far. It will be interesting to see how much the ranks change next week.",2016-05-03 01:48:37+00:00,d2qhd8y,1.0,t3_4hjv5n,16125.0,baseball

Top three holds the same, with the Mets climbing to the 4 spot after a bounce-back week. Royals keep budging their way up, now at 6.

Houston falls to 8: I had to drop them at this point, but I still really like them going forward.

White Sox are the biggest movers, from 17 up to 10. Not completely sold on them, but they keep winning. Meanwhile, the
DBacks jump from 19 to 13 after sweeping San Fran and playing a close series against a tough Pirates team. Jake Lamb and Beef Mode look goooood.

Texas down to 14, I still don‚Äôt like their rotation. Cleveland back up to 11.

1047,"Phillies voter checking in.

I‚Äôve moved the Phillies from 29th, only ahead of Atlanta, up to 26th, ahead of the Twins, Padres, and Brewers. I still like the Reds a bit more, since they have better bats and some pitchers returning from the DL soon.

The Nationals have moved up to the second best team in baseball after a 9-2 start. Even though we fucked up Papelbon, they still have a ridiculous rotation, Harper, and a solid lineup around him.

Meanwhile, the Mets fell to sixth, as their lineup is showing signs of weakness. Should be a good race between Washington and NY to win the east.

Biggest movers were the Orioles, jumping from 20 to 11. That lineup is beastly, but they still lack any good starting pitching. AL East is a crapshoot, but I still like Toronto out of the bunch, especially now that Aaron Sanchez looks like a legit starter.

Royals feel more legit to me after a strong start, and I‚Äôm starting to come around on the Giants, although their rotation still doesn‚Äôt impress me.

Still have Cleveland and Tampa higher than most because of their pitching, though they‚Äôve fallen a bit from slow starts.

Twins have gone freefalling after a miserable start, and the Diamondbacks took a big hit as well.",2016-04-18 23:19:42+00:00,d2866cj,1.0,t3_4fe8ng,5739.0,baseball

The speed and ground balls help quite a bit, but .380 is insane. Herrera isn't Miguel Cabrera or Paul Goldschmidt.

For a guy whose game is based on making contact, Herrera's 24% k-rate is abysmal. His high BABIP is a result of poorly hit balls falling in, which is not repeatable. And it's not like he has Dee Gordon or Billy Burns level speed.

When Herrera's BABIP regresses to where it should be, in the .320-.330 range, his offensive production will drop significantly. If the Phillies have the chance to trade him, they should pull the trigger before it's too late.",2015-12-10 21:27:01+00:00,cxukg54,5.0,t1_cxuj9l3,1661.0,phillies

&gt;Don't know when I will get a chance to do a full post on Altherr, great athlete, above avg to plus defender in CF, plus in either corner

&gt;Plus speed, but not fastest accelerator due to long legs, seemingly glides.  Plus arm, weapon in CF or LF

&gt;At the plate he has smoothed out the swing, there is some swing and miss despite huge improvements in his approach

&gt;Plus raw power, ceiling of 15-20 HRs at his peak.  Swing can pepper gaps with line drive doubles

&gt;Floor is 4th outfielder, likely outcome is somewhere between that and a regular, absolutely has destroyed LHPs at every level

I think Ross is the clear #1, even with his super high walk rate. After that I like Taijuan, although he has shown to be very inconsistent. Heaney is also solid, but he's got regression coming his way. Cashner and Bauer have good strikeout rates but are going to have ERAs in the high 3 / low 4 range. Montgomery, Iwakuma, and Norris are a tier below everyone else, although if Norris has a few more starts like the one on Sunday, he will be in the discussion.
