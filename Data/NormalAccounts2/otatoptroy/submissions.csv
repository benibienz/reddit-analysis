Hello everybody, and welcome to the first annual /r/Phillies gift exchange! We will be conducting this exchange in the same way that /r/baseball does.

How this works: you will sign up using an email address, shipping address, and price range of the gift YOU are willing to give. You can also include your username and some gift-pertinent information about yourself. Your email will NOT be shared with anyone, your address will ONLY be shared with your gift-giver, and your username will only be shared IF YOU WANT IT TO.

After choosing your gift's price range you can choose whether you want to receive a gift within your price range, or can choose ""Surprise me!"" which means you may receive a gift in almost any price range (those who are giving a gift valued under $16 can only receive gifts valued up to $30, those who are giving a gift valued over $30 will not receive a gift valued under $16).

*The spirit of this event is to give a special gift to another /r/Phillies user, and receive a random Phillies/baseball related gift in return.  When in doubt, don't sign up for a price range that you wouldn't be afraid to receive nothing in return for.*

Once registration closes you will be sent your recipient's interests and address.

Happy gift giving!

MOST LOPSIDED TRADE

**Kinsler for Garcia:** 13 votes (50%)

&gt;Tigers traded a 5+ WAR 2B with a team friendly contract and what they got in return was 2 meh young players. All to save ~20M, he could have gotten much more for Kinsler

&gt;Kinsler was a 6 WAR player last year and he got traded for salary relief and some spare prospects. The Tigers didn't even manage to get the Dodgers' best prospects.

Doolittle for Fisher+: 3 votes (11.5%)

&gt;The guy has barely pitched 50 innings in the last 2 seasons combined. Sure all those prospects arent sure things, but it seems like a lot to me.

&gt; Thats a lot for a guy who wasn't even the closer on the fucking Athletics lmao.  Also although it isn't included Brantley trade was traaaaash

Goldschmidt for McCullers+: 3 votes (11.5%)
&gt;Paul Goldschmidt is on a whole other level than these other guys. It's a nice haul coming back but I think Dbacks will regret this in a few years.

Davis for Musgrove+: 2 votes (7.7%)

&gt;Musgrove is decent and it's only one year of Davis but Doolittle and Herrera both got better value and if Jansen is getting that contract there wasn't any need to rush into this

&gt;Two-time All-Star closer with legit Cy Young votes in exchange for a couple of above average prospects. tJaBJjl

Neris for Fedde+: 1 vote (3.8%)

&gt;One good year, and as a reliever. Why.

***

MOST FAIR TRADE

**Goldschmidt for McCullers+:** 6 votes (23.1%)

&gt;It's a lot to give up, but if the Astros are going all in, it's pretty fair.

&gt;I think both teams did pretty well here actually. Astros need to supplement this move by adding to their rotation though.

Bell for Ross: 5 votes (19.2%)

&gt;Looks like a classic win-win trade for both teams.

Doolittle for Fisher+: 1 vote (3.8%)

&gt;The Stros paid dearly for a kickass pen, but they'll be unbeatable late in games.

Kazmir for Dykstra: 1 vote (3.8%)

&gt;Kazmir makes a ton of sense for the Barves and I like him more than a lot of the salary dumps, but for LA it's not about the money it's about the fact that Kazmir had no path to the rotation at all. If you squint Dykstra is kind of interesting

***

BEST SIGNING

**Utley to Angels:** 11 votes (42.3%)

&gt;A steal at twice the price.

&gt;If Utley does close to as well as he did last year, $3 million is a bargain.

Colon to Mets: 5 votes (19.2%)

&gt;BIG SEXY FOR SMALL MONEY

&gt;Is Bartolo the next Otani? Can pitch and hit dongs.

&gt;Apparently I got Bart under market value, so I'm a happy camper

Castro to Astros: 4 votes (15.4%)

&gt;why would castro sign that

&gt;Castro was one of the best catchers on the markets, and locking him up for less than the cost of 1 win per year is a steal.

&gt;castro, one of the best defensive catchers, for nothing

Desmond to Rangers: 4 votes (15.4%)

&gt;The cheap Utley and Castro signings were well and good but keeping Desmond at a reasonable price when Turner is getting 25 a year and Kenley is getting 130m is a sneaky solid move  

&gt;Impact bat for solid price. There are other ""bargains"" but this is likely to have the biggest return on investment.

&gt;I genuinely thought Desmond would get a lot more AAV.

Anderson to Pirates: 1 vote (3.8%)

&gt;I'm sure it'll be a flood of Utley, but he was B A D from June on. Give me the cheap wild card that could give you a sub 3.5 ERA

***

WORST SIGNING

**Jansen to Giants:** 16 votes (61.5%)

&gt;What the fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck

&gt;When the best justification you have for making the move is ""at least now the Dodgers don't have him,"" congratulations, you fucked up.

&gt;Absolute Insanity. Jansen with a QO attached is worth maybe 70 million max. 

Turner to Dodgers: 8 votes (30.8%)

&gt;Justin Turner is 32. Forget about the money, 5 years is a long time for an injury-prone 3B.

&gt;This dude was a castoff from the Mets like 3 years ago. I'm not a believer of him being paid like a superstar.

Anderson to Pirates: 1 vote (3.8%)

&gt;If the pirates wanted someone who won't end up throwing a single pitch for them, they could have signed me for slightly less.

***

MOST SURPRISING MOVE

**Goldschmidt trade**: 9 votes

&gt;Even if the D'Backs are rebuilding, I don't think that's a player I would move.

&gt;The dbacks would trade every other player on their roster before they would move Goldschmidt.

&gt;I expected Goldschmidt to stay put this offseason, and even if he had been traded, I wasn't expecting the Astros to pursue him.

&gt;Holy shit Goldy for McCcullers week 1 wtf wow

Jansen signing: 7 votes

&gt;A huge outlay for a team not typically known as a big free agent spender.

&gt;Over 20M/year for 60-70 innings? K

Pence trade: 5 votes

&gt;I get that the Giants have spent most of the week trying to shed salary because of Kenley but trading Pence for spare parts is the last thing anyone expected them to do. Pence loves SF and SF fans love him, trading him to give Nick Markakis more playing time I guess is weird.

&gt; Pence is a fan favorite in San Fran, and Giants didn't need to move him anyway. I'm surprised they moved him.

***

BEST GM

**Grizzy (Astros)**: 13 votes

&gt;He has put together maybe the best cost-controlled infield in the AL, along with a bullpen that's hard to match. Now he just needs starters.

&gt;RIP his smooth farm, but his team is going to be unreal for the next 3 years. Plenty of time to restock the farm.

&gt;Adding Goldy makes the Astros a heavy favorite for the AL title, and I really like the Castro deal.

&gt;Yes, they blew their farm on a lot of high-name talent. But if there's any team in the major leagues that should do that, it's them, right? They have a shitload of controllable talent to build around, and even some of the new additions are around for a while and for cheap. The rotation still isn't perfect, but the lineup and bullpen is now completely absurd.


Derp (Angels): 1 vote

&gt;Under the radar all week but picking up Grandy, Tomlin, Nunez, and Utley is gonna help the Angels a lot. The farm is already a disaster, moving a few pieces of it won't change anything and the Angels have a much better shot to contend than people realize.

Betty (Athletics): 1 vote

&gt;doolittle haul is the best imaginable for an above-average closer with injury issues

***

WORST GM

Wharble (Giants): 9 votes

&gt;I understand the idea of what the Giants did, but I think most of it was a mistake. Trying desperately to move anybody making money because of an overly aggressive Jansen contract, but still taking on the money of Markakis and Gallardo who don't have much value as players. Kenley will make the bullpen a strength but the lineup looks like a problem and I'm not sure how much Gallardo and Karns do for the rotation.

&gt;He gave a reliever 130M and then traded Pence for nothing. What the fuck.

&gt;overpaid for the second best rp on the market and traded his best and only prospect for nick markakis

JoseCansecoMilkshake (Tigers): 7 votes

&gt;Only move so far has been trading away Kinsler for almost nothing.

&gt;Tigers only made one move, but it was one of the crappiest ones of the week. There might be some future moves that balance it out, but for now, this was the only team that I thought got glaringly worse.

Best or worst to work with (TALK SHIT ON EACHOTHER PART)

&gt;Kuhan asks way too much for his players
A bunch of people don't want to offer anything but will say they are interested
The mods are hitler
Speedy might be ghosting us again
Deino is the worst

&gt;Agents: bgro &amp; kuhan, always active in slack and quick to respond
GMs: Betty &amp; Chargedcable, I had smooth negotiations for blockbusters
Worst: bnavis, the Rangers suck

&gt;I really like working with davoarid - he's clear, can make a deal that's fair for both sides, and is very active.

&gt;Astros was the best--dude knew exactly what he wanted and didn't screw around. Brewers GM is tied for first too--very patient and creative in trying to make a 3-team swap.

&gt;swedishfish bc I like how he tells it like it is.

Closing comments

&gt;Trade Slots is not a fucking meme. I know you guys hate when I bring this up, but at this point I don't know what I can do to convince you that they exist to some extent. Do I know 100% how they work in the MLB? No. But I know a hell of a lot more about them then you. If you don't believe me, that's fine. Keep a closed mind. But if you would like to learn about how a front office operates from a real MLB source, then maybe you can listen to me and you might just learns thing or two. So let's all calm down for a minute. Stop trying to make a meme out of nothing and if we want to have a real discussion about incorporating trade slots then we can talk about it, but if I hear one more damn joke about this shit then let me tell you, you will be mighty embarrassed when you finally learn that they are real. Sorry for the long post but we need to tone this down big time.

&gt;the trade slots thing is annoying, and not funny at all.

&gt;http://imgur.com/a/scZvq

&gt;there have been way more ""take my bad contract and i'll give you a prospect"" trades than usually happen in reallife

&gt;The Astros are going to win the World Series

&gt;For those of you not in slack, youre missing out. It's way better than irc ever was.

I'm Troy, or /u/otatoptroy, and I'll be joining /u/Jayyburdd as a new moderator of the sub. I'm excited to join an already outstanding team of mods to continue improving and developing the subreddit. We have a great community here at /r/phillies, one that I have been an active member of in my four years on Reddit.

As for me, I have been a Phillies fan for my entire life, born and raised in the Philadelphia region. I experienced the five straight division titles, as well as the drought that followed. I have faith in our front office and our farm system, and believe we will contend in the next few years. 

Some of you may know me from the /r/baseball trade deadline, where I sent you folks off to new subreddits in exchange for their users. I am also the Phillies representative for the /r/baseball power rankings and /r/baseball player of the week voting (which I administer and post results for every week). You can follow me on Twitter [@RotoTroy](https://twitter.com/rototroy) where I pretty much just retweet pictures of Odubel Herrera.

Thanks again to our great team of mods for welcoming me aboard, I hope to do everything I can to help make this sub the best that it can be!",phillies,New Mod in Town,https://www.reddit.com/r/phillies/comments/4ufpdl/new_mod_in_town/

Phillies blurb:

&gt; The Phillies will continue winning one-run games for the rest of eternity.

Still haven't moved us up above 16. Miami hopped us, moving up to 15, while the Royals fell below to 18.

I have the Pirates as my third best team, which is way higher than anyone else. They will likely be moving down in the next few weeks, although I still love that lineup. Cardinals are fourth, but I feel like they have a better chance of sticking high, since they have a great run differential and underlying stats.

Red Sox soar up to the five spot after scoring a billion runs. Mets fall to the 8 spot.

Royals all the way down to 18, getting jumped by the Rockies at 17. We all know the lineup is good, but if they have two (or even one) legit starters in Gray and Chatwood, Rockies could be something more this year.

CONSENSUS PHILLIES RANK: 19

MY PHILLIES RANK: 16

Fightin' Phillies blurb:
&gt;Hold on to your butts! This Phillies hype train has no brakes. The Phils had back to back sweeps this week, against Washington and Cleveland, and are up to .600! They are currently tied for the second NL Wild Card spot. Is this success sustainable? Doubtful. But it sure has been a fun ride so far.

After a 6-0 week, Phillies sit at 16. At 15-10, I don’t think their record is very legitimate. The pitching staff is very good, but young and volatile. They will face hurdles as the season goes on. Doesn’t help that Adam Morgan has to pitch now, either. Herrera has been an absolute monster, and Franco is a beast, but the rest of the lineup isn’t so spooky. BP’s 3rd Order Win Percent still has the Phillies below .500, so this is probably the highest spot the Phillies will rank all year, unless our top prospects (plus Altherr) come up later in the year and make an immediate impact. With all that being said, this is still an incredibly fun team with lots to watch for. Now, for the rest of the ranks.

Great week from the Mets has them soaring up two the two spot. Meanwhile, an abysmal week from the Dodgers knocks them to 6. At this point, their roster just doesn’t impress me like it did earlier in the year (although they are still sixth). Pirates and Cardinals nudge into the top 5.

White Sox are playing some great baseball, so they move up to 7. Red Sox make a huge jump from 17 up to 9 after sweeping the Yanks and winning three against Atlanta.

Orioles had a 3-4 week, but ended up going four spots forward to 8, because of the teams in front of them dropping back. We’ll see how long this holds up, but they’ve played well this year.
Had to drop the Blue Jays at this point. Still like the roster, but the results just haven’t been coming. Same with the Astros, who are down to 20. They are going to need some positive correction out of the pitching staff to climb back, or A.J. Reed.

Tigers make a huge jump up to 11, while the Mariners move up to 13. Both teams have good records, but I’m iffy on them going forward. I feel the same way about Texas, too, but they sit atop the AL Bleh, so they’ll remain in the top 10 for now.

The stubborn Royals are finally knocked back to 12, although I suspect they may work their way back up. Stop outperforming projections, stay down there!

Marlins quietly had a great week, sweeping the Dodgers in a four game set and taking two of three from Milwaukee. Tough for me to keep them behind Philly, but the Dee suspension will hurt. On the plus side, Dietrich is free now.

For whatever reason, this felt like my most volatile week for rankings. I think part of that comes from a lot of teams either having great weeks or horrible weeks, but there was still a lot more change than there has been so far. It will be interesting to see how much the ranks change next week.

Phillies blurb:
&gt;Maikel Franco and Odubel Herrera are killing it at the plate! And I can't fail to mention Hector Neris, who has been dirty out of the pen. Although the pitching staff had some struggles, the Phils were able to go 3-3 on the week, and even reached .500 on Saturday. This team isn't very good, but they're fun.

Phillies move up to 25, I’ll just barely take them over the Reds at this point. Miami still ahead.

The Cubs were the clear favorite at the start of the year, so this kinda goes without saying, but damn they are good. Playing in a tier of their own at this point.

Top three holds the same, with the Mets climbing to the 4 spot after a bounce-back week. Royals keep budging their way up, now at 6.

Houston falls to 8: I had to drop them at this point, but I still really like them going forward. 

White Sox are the biggest movers, from 17 up to 10. Not completely sold on them, but they keep winning. Meanwhile, the 

DBacks jump from 19 to 13 after sweeping San Fran and playing a close series against a tough Pirates team. Jake Lamb and Beef Mode look goooood.

Texas down to 14, I still don’t like their rotation. Cleveland back up to 11.

Mariners up to 19 after a strong week, moving ahead of Oakland, who also played well. I want to move the A’s up, but they’re jammed behind the M’s and the AL East teams occupying 18-16.

Phillies blurb:
&gt;So if you haven’t heard by now, Vince Velasquez is basically the dopest pitcher on the planet. The whole Phillies rotation has been outstanding so far, which helps make up for the horrendous lineup. But if there’s one pitcher the Phillies can hit, [it’s Papelbon](http://i.imgur.com/35MjyxE.png)

I’ve moved the Phillies from 29th, only ahead of Atlanta, up to 26th, ahead of the Twins, Padres, and Brewers. I still like the Reds a bit more, since they have better bats and some pitchers returning from the DL soon.

The Nationals have moved up to the second best team in baseball after a 9-2 start. Even though we fucked up Papelbon, they still have a ridiculous rotation, Harper, and a solid lineup around him. Meanwhile, the Mets fell to sixth, as their lineup is showing signs of weakness. Should be a good race between Washington and NY to win the east.

Biggest movers were the Orioles, jumping from 20 to 11. That lineup is beastly, but they still lack any good starting pitching. AL East is a crapshoot, but I still like Toronto out of the bunch, especially now that Aaron Sanchez looks like a legit starter.

Royals feel more legit to me after a strong start, and I’m starting to come around on the Giants, although their rotation still doesn’t impress me. 

Still have Cleveland and Tampa higher than most because of their pitching, though they’ve fallen a bit from slow starts.

Twins have gone freefalling after a miserable start, and the Diamondbacks took a big hit as well.
