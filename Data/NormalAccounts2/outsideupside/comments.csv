51,"In November 2010 my boyfriend moved overseas. I had a shitty housemate and a terrible job with a horrible boss. My boyfriend's family didn't like me but we really wanted to get married. I was really unsure of my future and felt very alone. 

Before he left my boyfriend dumped a bunch of movies and audio books on my laptop. One day, after calling him in tears, he told me to listen to the audio books. I really didn't want to but he insisted it would take my mind off things. And it did.

It wasn't long after that I listened to them in bed to help distract me from life and it helped me sleep. Nothing ever had that effect before. And I haven't stopped listening. Every single night. Nearly six years now. 

They helped me get through a difficult, long distance engagement, through all the wedding planning and the international relocation. When my mother in law became emotionally abusive I could escape at night into a world of stupidity and crazy high pitched laughter. 

Life is pretty great now, but I can't live without them. My husband knows, I quote them all the time and I'm often giggling to myself when he's trying to sleep! ",2016-08-09 09:36:29+00:00,d6a6kpp,1.0,t3_4wt7bj,36147.0,rickygervais

290,"I got the mirena because the pills, implants and injections fucked me up mentally and made me bleed constantly. 

The first few weeks after I got the mirena were hell. I was in so much pain I was filling my water bottle at work with the hottest water possible and pressing it against my abdomen during meetings trying to look inconspicuous. The string thing was long, hurt my partner during sex and always caused me to bleed afterwards. After awhile the pain stopped, I got the string cut shorter and then it got better. Way better than I  expected.  

No more major emotional swings, no more bleeding after, no more periods and... AND no more acne!! 
Seriously, no more acne. I've had crappy skin forever, I couldn't remember a time without at least one pimple or dry, gross patches my whole adult life and now I have perfect perfect skin. I still can't believe it!
