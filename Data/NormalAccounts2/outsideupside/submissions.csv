They diagnosed him after he was discharged for my sister's wedding. He has some damage to his spinal cord that is causing him problems walking, pain in his left leg and numbness from his chest down. We're trying to decide what to do next. My questions are, can this parasite keep doing damage? Or has it done all the damage it could do? Could there be ongoing or increasing damage/inflammation to the spinal cord?",AskDocs,Angiostrongylus cantonensis,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/55b1h4/angiostrongylus_cantonensis/

They're typical punjabi grandparents and usually my mother in law would cook punjabi food for them when they visit but she's away and I'm stuck. I figured, because I'm gori, I can get away with cooking a different cuisine instead of being judged on something they fancy themselves experts in (they own an Indian restaurant where they live).

So my question is, what non-Indian cuisine do you enjoy or have found to be popular with older, more traditional Desis?
