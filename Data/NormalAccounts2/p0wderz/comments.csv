i like rockhold and his style, and i like seeing new champions to keep the matchups interesting so im leaning towards him. but on the other hand wideman has handled everyone thrown at him so far so very tough one to call!

Had Ronda evoked her will with her wrestling more then who knows what the outcome might have been.  Sure Ronda got her down to the ground once but it was not  Holly's boxing skills that got her out of it and back on her feet.

this is ronda's comments on her instagram     as if the whole thing is holly's fault.    how many hundreds of thousands of kids are gonna see her acting like this as think    this is the way to act ?

i understand people get upset and emotions are quite high during staredowns and such  but imo the whole thing was initiated by ronda.
