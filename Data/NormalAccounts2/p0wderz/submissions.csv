Would they not want the starting pitcher to pitch as many as possible to get him out of the game asap?

id love to see our average in this series on first pitches.",Torontobluejays,am i alone on this one?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Torontobluejays/comments/3pz3ph/am_i_alone_on_this_one/

I've just dived back into the game and am leveling another cleric.   id like to mostly just heal dungeons along my journey ( ofc have dps spec for what quests i do) and have had little problems so far. 

The only thing that's been troubling me so far has been the add-on I've got for healing,  click box healer.  For the most part its been working fine for me but a few things haven't , namely

1.    I find a lot of the time  i try to shield the tank and it will just shield me instead?  Not sure if its just me being stupid but it happens enough to annoy me a lot.

2.   I am rather new to the add-on but i cant seem to figure out if i am able to put a symbol over the name plate when i hot anyone in my group.   just would be super helpful to see who its on and how much time is left on it.

3. i have done some searching on the net and this seems to be the best healing add-on avail atm?   id love any other recommendations .

appreciate any help.  ",Rift,healing question :),https://www.reddit.com/r/Rift/comments/3o00wl/healing_question/
