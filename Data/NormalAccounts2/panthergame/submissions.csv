I like you as a caster, here are a couple of things that I noticed that will really help you become great.

* There are times that you talk a lot. I mean non stop talking for 30+ seconds. Obviously if it's a hectic round, you need to commentate it, but sometimes you are talking about a play that someone made, or a decision someone made, and you go into it for 30+ seconds when the rest of the round is still going on.

* IMO you don't need to mention every little thing that happens in the round. There are times where you are mentioning something small and insignificant, and you miss out on pointing something a lot more important because you haven't finished talking about the previous point.

These are the main things I noticed, if anyone else has feedback, leave a comment and I will add it to the main post. 

Other than that you have improved a lot over the last few months, and I hope to see that continue!",GlobalOffensive,Blu casting feedback,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/4nm2oz/blu_casting_feedback/

Instead of just hearing the facts; ""There are billions of starts in our galaxy, and billions of Galaxies in the Universe"", I actually stopped and allowed myself to *feel* the size of Space, if that makes sense. I literally felt a wave of amazement flow over me, my heart skipped a beat and my jaw dropped. This wasn't even triggered by something specifically, I was just cruising through the comments on the thread. It was one of the best experiences of my life, and it happened sitting in my computer chair. 

I have always loved space and been interested in it, and I thought I knew the extent of the Universe and had come to terms with its incredible size. Until now.

**Pistols**

Pistols in this game are incredibly overpowered. I don't think there is a single person here who doesn't think that, and wouldn't like to see them changed. Most pistols are pretty much 100% accurate whilst running, and accompany that with the one hit headshot potential at close range, it's almost worth just pulling one out when you are clearing out close corners. 

Changes that need to be made:

* Dramatically decrease running accuracy
* Completely remove one hit headshots on all pistols apart from the Deagle
* Lower damage slightly, and lower the damage drop-off range

**Rifles**

I'm sure most of us have seen the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0rlCJ047Ds) by /u/BuddhistSC where he demonstrated the dramatic inaccuracy of weapons at long range, specifically the AK. Only having a 38% pit to A ramp, does not only lower the skill ceiling, but somewhat nullifies the time that people put in to improve their aim. I feel like having this handicap just takes one playstyle out of the game (tapping), by making it far inferior to spraying. (Obviously you wouldn't spray from pit to A ramp, but in other circumstances it would make a big difference. Instead of having severe RNG elements in the game (especially on such a staple weapon like the AK-47), Valve need to make everything even and skill based, which allows the people who want to put in the time and hard work to master a skill beat someone who doesn't.

Changes that need to be made:

* Dramatically increase the first bullet accuracy of the AK-47 and M4
* Slightly increase the rate of fire you can tap at before becoming inaccurate

                                                                                                                                                                    

Another thing that I personally would like to see changed but is up for debate, is removing the screen shake when you shoot a gun, or at least decrease it. For those of you who don't know what I am talking about, join a game and pay attention to the actual screen, not the crosshair, and you will notice it shake quite significantly. 

Again I feel as if this counters tapping quite a lot.

Feel free to comment your suggestions as well and I will add them to the list if enough people agree. Let's try and actually make some needed changes in this game.
