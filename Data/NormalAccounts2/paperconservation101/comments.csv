21,"I work in a school with exceptionally poor to lower middle class students. Obesity is generally found in the kids of the upper working class to lower middle class. The kids whose parents can give them 10 dollars pocket money a week. 

There was an interesting question on the health exam for the year 7s. The PE teacher asked students to consider the link between poverty and obesity. The kids in true poverty couldnt see the link. 

In their families there is no money for take out, there is generally little money for food for their families. Meals are cheap cuts of goat and rice. Or pasta and cheap meat. Or bulk veg and lentils. They have no soft drinks, only milk and water. Either one or both parents are at home - so someone can cook.

Our slightly wealthier (though still poor to he rest of Australia) have that little extra in the weekly pay. Dad works long hours in the taxi and mum does part time shifts at the childcare centre. There isnt always someone home to cook. Mum sends little Mohamud to school with 3 dollars to buy a pie because her shifts were moved around and she didnt have time to make lunch. 

So our wealthier and slightly fatter kids could answer the question that junk food is cheaper for lunch than a proper sandwich. However our very poor students never eat a $2 dollar happy meal and will generally have one meal a day if there is no breakfast club in the morning. They thought poverty equalled skinniness. They joke that having money makes you fat. ",2016-11-20 05:17:37+00:00,da7v6yo,1.0,t3_5dv2m6,22853.0,fatlogic

34,"do you have stats on this? 

About a year ago I was at the post office, a young man on a TPV was desperately attempting to use a money order to pay his rent. The post office worker was refusing to allow it, claiming he did not have the correct ID. The man had a photo ID, of the entry visa the Australian government gave him to enter into Australia. 

The post officeworker refused to accept it. This man was in tears, he had paid his rent before using the post office and the money order with this ID (the visa). Suddenly this ID was no longer acceptable. The post officer worker told him to go to the commonwealth bank with no other explanation. The man, with his limited English, could barely understand what was going on.

I stepped in at this moment and became a second person to ID this money order. I spoke to this young man. His was one of 8 people in his family from Iraq on TPV, they had moved out of government accommodation into private because they didnt fit in the two bedder. 

This man was at the end of his rope. His entire family relied on him to translate, to cover the rent, to deal with government paperwork. He was only 23. He was scared, terrified of going back yet scared to stay in Australia. He was stressed and had such a feeling of hopelessness. He didnt understand Australian banking, as generally banks are not trusted in his home country. He didnt understand how his official paperwork was valid. He didnt know any citizens who could help. His father was broken, his mother was terrified of the government, his siblings were scared. He had the most education and the best English and now was the defacto head of the family. 

I can understand why the man who set fire to the bank finally snapped. To I think what happened was a terrible thing? yes. Of course. Do I think its a reflection on society, that we do not protect our most vulnerable? Yes. 

I have a student whose father fled the Taliban. The family had a TPV to live in Australia. Red Cross was assisting the family as both parents suffered from depression and as their claims were still being processes they received only limited government support. 

Last term holidays, this students father walked into the backyard early in the morning, slit his wrists and lay down to die.

She thinks that the Year 12 graduation she attended was the pretend graduation and the kids still havent graduated until the official school year finishes. I asked her where she thought the kids were then and what the purpose of the ceremony where the words ""Graduation"" and ""left school"" were used.

However there was very little systematic anti Christian laws or activities except for Nero in one instance and decius 250 years later. 

The Christian history also leaves out that Jews were targeted when ever Christians were and often to a much worse degree (though those were actual wars between nations). Several emperors even made laws to protect Christians (Jews didn't get those) .

731,"""Cute"" clothing is designed for the youth. Adults are meant to age out of ""cute"" and into workwear. 

High end work-wear companies will have more generous sizes as they are designed for an older client whom has a different fat distribution to a youth client. Think lower sitting breasts, lower sitting butt and wider hips. 

You want well made clothes that fit? Try the designer workwear. You want cuteness (lets be honest, after 25 you need to get out of the tween section) you are shit out of luck. 

Example Alice McCall does youth high end fashion. I just fit into her largest size, its tight in the boobs and hips. Veronika Maine, a ""older"" designer does high end work and play wear for the professional crowd. I easily fit into her mid size. 

Maine does lower edge of plus sizes and the cuts are designed to have room in places which the average youth wouldnt need it. Why? Because there is a ton of middle aged women in highly corporate environments with cash to splash who want some fucking nice clothes. These women wouldnt touch cute with a ten foot pole. 

Hey you want cute clothes thats fantastic. However you need to understand that clothing designers base designs on both age demographics and cost to manufacture.

The kids replied that the two diabetics were late to class as they were doing their sugar checks as required after lunch. The crt thought they were faking it. They showed her their pin prick cut and she said they were still lying. They were offended but settled down. 

Then the asthmatic kids started wheezing, from the stress, he asked to get his inhaler and the crt thought he was faking. Mind you on her key we have large colour flash cards of all the kids with issues that we tell them to read.

However if a leader only closely wins the election (and keeps their seat) the party might feel less confident in their leader. The party (elected members who won their seats and maybe other party officials, though I'm not sure since they changed the rules) can call a vote of no confidence in their leader, suggest another leader and then hold a vote inside their own party. Some times they just do this because they know that by the time of the election they will be such a terrible place in the polls everyone in the party will lose their seats.

Rudd was removed by Gillard (Labor inside a term, apparently Rudd was a cunt but popular in the polls), then Gillard won a small minority government in the election, just before the next election after Gillard was removed and Rudd put back in (they thought Gillard couldnt win again). Labor lost the federal election and the Liberal party were voted in under Abbott. Abbott was single handed the most unpopular prime minster in living memory so his party removed him and placed Turnbull in. 

Now this is a double dissolution election called very early (both the house and the Senate are up) because the Libs only controlled one house and couldn't pass their shitty budgets for 2 years. This has only happened once in our history prior. 

So now Turnbull (Liberal) is against Shorten (Labor). Shorten was elected party head after Labor lost the federal election. This sort of change is normal, generally the losing leader steps down. 

So we went from 11 years of Howard (Liberal - lost his election and his seat, that is very rare) to Rudd/Gillard/Rudd (2 terms Labor) to Abbott/Turnbull (Liberal again) 

So out of this whole mess I as a 30 year old was able to vote during the Rudd-Turnbull era. Its a national joke. ",2016-07-01 12:40:40+00:00,d4v91ug,4.0,t1_d4v4e7e,14200.0,worldnews

1505,"its forcing the body to burn fat as an energy source, not glucose (ie carbs). You cut out all carbs (and therefore sugar) from your diet. At the start you drop really low on the carbs in an attempt to start ketosis, you body runs out of glucose for energy and starts fat metabolism. You use your stored fat and your diet fat. 

With most people, you lose weight quickly and feel like shit as you enter ketosis. However after a few days you feel amazing. Your diet is based around fat then protein with a tiny amount of carbs. You eat less because you feel fuller on a high fat diet though you are eating less calories. You has more constant energy as the fat is a slow burn with no big crashes. 

However not everyone can handle cutting out all carbs forever. You also need to seriously work out your macros to ensure you dont actually get sick. You also really need to ensure you cut out the carbs and sugars. I know American food has heaps of added sugar so its tricky. 

I've been on keto for 5 months. I find it really easy to follow now. My partner lost a ton of weight. We can still eat out and enjoy fine dining. It takes a bit of work but the results are fantastic.

1764,"One of the signs I had PCOS was I suddenly started gaining weight, though I was active and ate normally. I cut my intake and the weight was coming off slowly, much more slowly then it should. I also noticed my hair falling out and my periods where become heavy and irregular, all at the same time. In fact it was the odd periods that came first. 

Dr. Google said cancer so I raced to the doctor. 

My GP said its likely PCOS gave me my referral to the hospital for testing. The vagina wand said cysts where present so off I went to the endocrine doctor. She said and I quote
 ""Yeah you have PCOS because you put on weight"" 

so I said ""No the strange weight gain tipped me off that something was wrong, I was a normal BMI when my periods went whacky"". 

""Your BMI is 26, you weight caused this"" 

""I was BMI 23 WHEN I NOTICED STRANGE THINGS! THE WEIGHT GAIN AND SLOW LOSS WAS THE STRANGE THING. LOOK AT MY RECORD!"" 

""You need to lose weight"" 

""I FUCKING KNOW. WHY DO YOU THINK I'M HERE. ITS HAPPENING TOO SLOWLY"".  

She also mentioned I had high testosterone because I was a tall lady. Like height magically causes high testosterone. I'm tall because I come from generations of tall people. I'm the only one in the family with PCOS. Also I was tall before the PCOS. 

The kicker was she was obese. An obese doctor telling me PCOS is weight caused only. Fuck. Thin people get PCOS. 


Needless to say I ended up swapping doctors to someone useful. She actually gave me a recommended diet, suggesting keto. She also gave me ideas to help with faster weight loss and fiddled around with hormonal controls. Also she wasn't obese and she actually read my case file. Saw strange periods and hairloss happened several months before the weight gain. Got everything under control, well mostly under control.

1894,"okay, family at our school. Several children who are siblings or cousins of the caregiver+bio children. The non bio children suffer physically and psychological abuse. The kids are refugees who live with their caregiver and her husband. 

One child tells the school. We jump on the phone to all the bodies and file reports. The social worker interviews the kids and then the Mum AND TELLS THE MUM WHAT EACH KID SAID. Then since there was no physical evidence at the time, the family was housed, fed and all the kids had their own beds the case was closed. 

The behaviour of the kids at school keeps declining, obvious signs of emotional abuse. Schools on the phone weekly to humes services and the families social worker begging a return visit. Finally the mum beats the kids again. Kid comes in with bruises on her stomach. 

Police called and the family goes to court the next day. The magistrate at family court asks in open court where the kids want to go. What abused child who has only been in Australia for 3 years will go ""yeah I'm enter into the foster care system"". So kids stay with the family. 

Mum whips the kids out of our school and sends them to one down the road. We notify the school of the court case. Its been 2 months and the kids are still being hit and nothing has been done. 

Case 2) Mother of a family suffers from serve mental health issues, thinks the youngest son is possessed by the devil. Keeps trying to steal him from the dad and ""put him somewhere safe"" in between incidents of abuse. Father and the older kids have been begging the courts strip the mum of any parental rights of the youngest who cant defend himself. Courts keep allowing visitation of the mum, in one she stole the kid for a few hours. Nothing much as happened to help this. 

Case 3) Dad in the family is a abuse prick who rolls up to the ex wives house demanding money and terrifying the kids every few months. Breaks in and steals whatever is left around. Police reports filed, AVOs breached and that's it. Kids are asking why he hast been arrested, mums in public housing begging to be moved where he cant find them. Police arent communicating what is happening with the breached AVOs or the thefts. 

Best bit? He is still allowed rights to see his kids, which thank god he never does.

long answer: afro hair grows out form the head in a different way to euro hair and Asian hair. Kinky hair with the typical z pattern of growth is generally more prone to breaking and needs specialist care. For example afro hair the texture varies along the actual hair shaft while euro hair grows form the root in a single texture. 

Afro hair also has very diffuse hair growth meaning the hair grows without a defined pattern. Our cold winters make afro hair very brittle, particularly for recent arrivals. 

Also the growing cycle is at a different rate to euro hair. It takes longer to grow and as its often tightly curled it will take even longer to recover from a bad hair cut. ",2016-03-29 01:41:14+00:00,d1h529x,2.0,t1_d1h39i2,2696.0,melbourne

1995,"Hi there OP. 

I am a VCE English teacher who works with students with anxiety and anxiety disorders. There are quite a few things we can do. 

This reply is going to be fairly big. 

Big long terms things: 

- you need to apply for special provision through VCAA. You can have it for SACs and exams, though that is two different lots of paperwork. You will need to visit your GP to get them to fill out elements of the paperwork. You will be on the medical condition or personal circumstance. 
http://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/Pages/vce/exams/specialprovision/schoolassess.aspx 

- visit the school counselor and ask for support, a good counselor will know the referral progress for you to access support outside school. State *""I believe I have anxiety. I need to find support for my VCE to deal with it""*. Dont take no for an answer and ask about follow ups. Ask them to also sign off on the special consideration. 

- visit your GP and explain exactly what you felt, get as much medication documentation as possible. I recommend a low dose of Valium the night before a SAC, takes the edge off for some people. Other people prefer the breathing exercises in SACs, some people like to sit the SAC alone. This is all part of special consideration.  

- talk to your English teacher and explain exactly what you you felt and what could help. Dont mention the memorization or tutor part, it annoys English teachers. 
Short term things: 

- I'm not sure what essay is worth 10 marks, unless its the unit 1 context essay in 3 parts, in my school I simply ran three SACs and averaged the best result of 2 of them. Ask your teacher for a resit when you feel comfortable to resit. 

- If you are unit 1 the number means nothing, its simply a S/N. If you are in Unit 3 a single outcome is only worth 1/3 of the unit. VCE English is 50% Unit 3-4 ad 50% Exam. So a single SAC is very little weighting. 

General VCE advice: 

-dont try a memorize essays, please no, just dont. What you can memorise is quotes and ideas that think to certain themes. You know the essay will ask about conflict or character development - you know quotes that support these arguments. ",2016-03-09 07:10:06+00:00,d0t4up5,1.0,t3_49mybi,1024.0,melbourne

2192,"Well Models have, since the mid century, been outliers. Taller then the average and much thinner then the average. 

Why? Because high end models are there to be living coat hangers.  I have a friend who works as a materials buyer for a high end fashion house (a low serf in that house, she aint on the airplane with the designer) and the couture models are thin. Not BMI of 20, BMI of 16.  These girls are tall women with light frames who then keep low weights. 

You then have the ready to wear models are not as thin thin but still on the slender side. 

Followed by catalogue girls who are average BMI.  

If you are buying couture as a *normal person* you get a significant discount if you can fit into the size the model wore. Which is rare.  Considering couture sells for 10s of thousands.....",2016-01-26 03:21:09+00:00,czc3icg,3.0,t1_czbjiqq,29090.0,fatlogic

3030,"Christ my spelling. I meant load bearing. It basically means working with weight including your own body weight. So lighting light weights 2-5kgs or simply doing push ups and weight free squats then working up to heavier weights. Anything that places your body under some strain is good and should be done several times a week. 

This has a really important reason. When a woman goes through menopause we lose bone mass due to the drop in production of estrogen. 

When you work out in high impact load bearing activities you increase both muscle and bone density. 

So basically laying down the foundations of dense bones in your youth means you have greater protection against osteoporosis later in life, simply because you have more you can lose before bone density becomes an issue. 

Seeing what happened to my grandma has made me always ensure I look after my bones.

3) she made all the decorations herself. She decided on a winter wonderland theme. She bought the fabric whole sale and made the table clothes, lanyards and bows for the tables. She bought cheap glass vases from big w and cheap bamboo which she painted white. She also bought some nicer fake flowers and used them in the centre piece which was bulked out with flowers she got wholesale that morning. She got candles from the local church for 50cents and dishes from op shops.  

4) She did her make up her self and had her hair done as an ""up do"" not wedding (it was heaps cheaper) 

5) She made the invites herself and my parents set up the room the day before (this was cheaper because the venue didnt need the staff to do it) 

6) She had a small meal menu and was served promptly after the wedding (no need for snacks before) and there was only beer and soft drinks. 

7) She did the photography herself prior to the ceremony but on the day. This might be the tricky bit as our father, her husband and her are photographers so we have all the photo editing stuff and cameras already.  

8) she created a play list and used that for music. 

9) they had a cheese cake shop carrot cake and a coles ice cream cake (neither of them like cake much) served on pretty plates she found in an op shop.
