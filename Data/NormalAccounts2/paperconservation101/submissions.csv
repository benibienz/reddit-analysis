When I visit she generally looks at my head for 1 minute and refills my script and I book another appointment in 100 days. 

My script is a personalised dose of hormones and blood pressure medication. The chemist on site then mixed up 100 tablets, charges me $84 dollars and away I go. 

I am wondering if I can take this script to another chemist and get a cheaper and larger dose of medication. Say 250 tablets. Does anyone know of a chemist that makes personalised medication? Can I take the script to another chemist or am I stuck using the dermatologists monopoly?

My partner and I are going to the race day tomorrow in Melbourne, we had a look at the items allowed inside and we were wondering if a filled Thermos with tea is allowed in? 

We have the folding seats and cooler bag but were were wondering where a Thermos falls on the items allow?

I would it if the novel had romance as a suplot if its in the story. 

I'm thinking soft fantasy in the sense, yes magic is here but its not the only focus of the novel. 

I dont want the lead to have a ""tragic past"". I teach English. I have to read enough of those stories professionally. 

I dont mind about the length but I do need the novel in English.

I want to crack heads as this worker was in complete denial that it was a humanitarian visa, its the guys ID document. The guy didnt have his immicard yet.

I have a question for you all. My brother in law is African American. Since he moved to Oz to live with my sister he has had terrible hair cut after terrible hair cut, he had one hair cut where his hair line was 3 different lengths. This is because most barbers in Vic are not used to dealing with textured or kinky hair. 

Does anyone know of a good barber with knowledge of both African hair and a knowledge of trends in African American hair? ",melbourne,Barber for African hair. Suggestions?,https://www.reddit.com/r/melbourne/comments/3rvn5t/barber_for_african_hair_suggestions/

Well the inquest has been held and the Doctor was found to be at fault. So, not her size but poor action on behalf of the Doctor.
