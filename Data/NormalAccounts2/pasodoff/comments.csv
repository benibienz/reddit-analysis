19,"So as _tech_junkie_ suggested there are easier ways to achieve connection sharing over vpn. 

The only working mechanism I've found with android 5+ is to use [easytether](http://www.mobile-stream.com/easytether/).  I was able to successfully tunnel through my VPN from my hackintosh.  The best thing is that EasyTether supports OpenWrt-based routers. My next test will be to configure my Netgear WNR-3000 router. ",2016-03-06 09:40:16+00:00,d0pgyb1,1.0,t3_46q2dt,1282399.0,VPN

21,"Thanks for the suggestion.  I tried the `seamless tunnel` option.  It appears to have no effect.  I'm unable to ping google's DNS servers from devices on the wifi network when the OpenVPN client is connected.  I'm running [OpenVPN Connect](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.openvpn.openvpn&amp;hl=en_GB) (The Play store description claims to be the official OpenVPN app).

PS: As for the OpenVPN docker container, I'm running a Centos server with openvpn `2.3.10-1.el6` is there any benefit, other than containerization, of running it in a docker instance? As the VPN appeared to work fine on my phones and desktop, I assumed the issue was within the phone's network routing.",2016-02-21 09:21:03+00:00,d07z4mk,2.0,t1_d07nfug,27906.0,VPN
