###Current Specs:
 - [GA-H55N-USB3](http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=3455)
 - i3 540 @ 3.07Ghz
 - 4GB DDR3 1666 
 - [Radeon HD7870](http://gpuboss.com/graphics-card/Sapphire-Radeon-HD-7870)
 - Samsung 2.5 inch 250 GB 850 EVO Solid State Drive

Is it worth spending 100pounds ~ USD144 on

 - 4GB more ram
 - a used Intel Core i7-860 LGA1156

Or is that likely not to provide much benefit?

I understand the concepts but i'm not familiar enough with `iptables` and `ip rules` to  grasp whats going on.

I have successfully setup an OpenVPN server on my ""cloud server"". Confirmed OpenVPN Connect android client connect successfully.

I'm able to connect to my phone's wifi network but traffic is not being routed through the VPN tunnel. 

I have configured the following iptable rules as suggested on a number of [forums](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=39654892&amp;postcount=31) [posts](http://kingoftweaks.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03/wifi-hotspot-through-vpn.html?m=1)

    iptables -t filter -F FORWARD
    iptables -t nat -F POSTROUTING
    iptables -t filter -A FORWARD -j ACCEPT
    iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE 

When the VPN tunnel is enabled the ip rules look as follows:

    root@hammerhead:/ # busybox ip rule show
    0:      from all lookup local
    10000:  from all fwmark 0xc0000 lookup 99
    11000:  from all iif tun0 lookup 97
    12000:  from all fwmark 0xc0065 lookup main
    12000:  from all lookup main
    13000:  from all fwmark 0x10063 lookup 97
    13000:  from all fwmark 0x10064 lookup 234
    13000:  from all fwmark 0x10065 lookup main
    13000:  from all fwmark 0x10065 lookup main
    13000:  from all fwmark 0x10067 lookup 235
    14000:  from all lookup 234
    14000:  from all lookup main
    14000:  from all lookup 97
    14000:  from all lookup 235
    15000:  from all lookup 99
    16000:  from all lookup 98
    17000:  from all lookup 97
    18000:  from all iif wlan0 lookup 235
    19000:  from all fwmark 0x64 lookup 234
    19000:  from all fwmark 0x67 lookup 235
    21000:  from all fwmark 0x65 lookup 234
    22000:  from all lookup 234
    23000:  from all lookup main
    32000:  from all unreachable

From hours of reading it looks like all traffic not local to the phone goes to the 4g interface rather than the tun0 (VPN Tunnel).

It was suggested that the following commands would fix this:

    ip route add default dev tun0 scope link table 61
    ip route add 192.168.43.0/24 dev wlan0 scope link table 61
    ip route add broadcast 255.255.255.255 dev wlan0 scope link table 61

(As I saw no indication of a table 61 or 60 so I replaced 61 with 97, fail?)

This resulted in the following errors:

    root@hammerhead:/ #  ip route add default dev tun0 scope link table 97
    root@hammerhead:/ # ip route add 192.168.43.0/24 dev wlan0 scope link table 97
    RTNETLINK answers: File exists
    
    root@hammerhead:/ # ip route add broadcast 255.255.255.255 dev wlan0 scope link table 97
    Error: argument ""table"" is wrong: invalid ""scope"" value

I feel a little out of my depth but also that i'm pretty close. Any help or suggestions would be amazing!?  ",VPN,OpenVPN Connection sharing through Android 5.0.1?,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPN/comments/46q2dt/openvpn_connection_sharing_through_android_501/

I snagged them in a garage sale. I'm on a tight budget and don't know a lot about audio equipment. Everything I listen to is obtained online. Either streaming from Spotify, MixCloud, NPR App or digital downloads. I have a number of devices; ipad, hackintosh, android phone, raspberryPI and fireTV + Kodi. It would be great to connect the fireTV to the amp through optical connect but also be able to connect via bluetooth, airplay or headphone jack.  Any suggestions would be very much appreciated :).
