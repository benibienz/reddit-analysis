His theory was that a long time ago ETs came to Earth and made half human half animal hybrids. Government then finds evidence of these creatures and tries their best to replicate them for use in war but our technology wasn't enough to garner the desired results.

350,"I was the same way and had the same problem. He never gains weight because of his metabolism, it's really strong when you're younger. What I did was run, eat better and workout without any weights or protein supplements and I gained muscle, although I was very lean. What he needs to do is put in the effort and the results will come. I recommend asking r/bodyweightfitness for advice for him to find workout regimens, but if he insists on eating junk then at least take a multivitamin like One A Day for teens with his workout. 

If he's truly concerned about it he can always seek help from a medical professional. He can either go to someone to figure out how he can gain weight in a healthy way or turn to sports medicine to help him build muscle the right way. And since he's 17 he's probably still considered a minor so he might be able to get away with getting help through his parent's health insurance. Good luck.

We might even test their reactions to us a bit by sending images of human beings at one point and after we figure out whether or not we can survive a trip to the place and we'll be safe we make contact in the hopes of peace.

&gt; When contact is made, the bears nuzzle and chew on each other’s head and neck and may even wrestle a little.

And then there's this..

&gt; The act itself is repeated many times, each time it takes only a matter of seconds, but the pairs stays locked together (sometimes breaking for a nuzzle or bite on the neck/back or just walking about) until the next bout.

* I really want there to be some sort of Retaliatory Strike playlist. Like you start off on an easier difficulty then it goes up to Helldive. Then to make it even harder, *multiple* factions enter the strike at once. 

* I think it would be beneficial if your outfits had some sort of perk to them like in Magicka 2. 

* Different kinds of enemy masters, not just the same one with a different name.  

* You should be able to send suggestions to the host on who you want to be kicked. There's times where there's one asshole on the team and we want him gone but squad leader doesn't do anything about it. 

* More ways to communicate with people. Instead of every button on the d pad being a specific phrase have a wheel like in overwatch.

1124,"My old man is in his early 60s. He's about 5'5"" and is physically fit because of his job installing office furniture (*a lot* of heavy lifting) and high stamina because of his ability to keep up with not only his grandchildren but my cousin and older brother in games of 3v3 basketball. 

His ""feats"" include regularly getting into and winning fist fights from his childhood to adolescence. 

He can use a machete to cut down nearly anything (I've seen that myself). 

Knows how to use a gun because he lived in a military academy for a while and continued to carry one until he met mom. 

Wasn't afraid to fatally wound someone who threatened his life with his gun. 

Once when he was drunk he fell down a small cliff and wrestled/fought with a shadow person/demon who demanded that he give in to a life of sin so he could have his soul and won then climbed out and got home.

Was number one in his small pueblo's basketball team and went state.

Beat up three police officers on his own when they tried to restrain him.

I once saw him catch and behead a small snake.

Round 1: I would say its an even fight. Your dad's training as a boxer puts him at an advantage but my dad is in shape enough to take the hits. Probably 5/10.

Round 2: My dad takes this. He had already gone through the military academy at this point, was in top physical condition, and always carried a gun. I'm not sure how your dad would handle going up against a weapon but the second he would have threatened mine he would have been shot. 10/10

Round 3: My dad takes this easy. He took a beating from a supernatural entity, kicked its ass while drunk and then climbed up the cliff and walked home, was always carrying his gun and machete plus my dad was a math, english, and social studies teacher so I know he isn't dumber than yours.

1205,"Akuma is the last living person using Ansatsuken as intended, which was for killing and I'm sure that Buu would use the [Satsui No Hado](http://streetfighter.wikia.com/wiki/Satsui%20no%20Hado) to its full extent. He could also use the techniques to augment his own because I do consider Akuma a more technical and level headed fighter. He has somewhat of a moral code as well, like when he didn't fight Gen when he knew of his illness. While ultimately Buu wouldn't let this sway him easily, I do believe that these traits would pass on (a small sliver of Akuma's will lives on in Oni and I don't doubt the same would happen here) a certain discipline Buu has never had before. With this I don't think he would be as arrogant. 

As for Ryu + Goku.. Ryu uses the [Chikara No Hado](http://streetfighter.wikia.com/wiki/Chikara_no_Hado), a version of the Satsui No Hado that uses willpower, something Goku knows a lot about. Goku and Ryu are similar in a way that they both want to get stronger but want it through noble means. They also had a similar upbringing and have gone through the same kind of training since they were kids, this would likely help them attain a sort of symmetry while fused.

1851,"Superman doesn't just swing his fist as hard as he can. He does know some fighting techniques, both offensive and defensive that Goku could find beneficial. Here are some excerpts from the DC Wiki.

&gt;  **Expert Combatant:** Due to having superpowers all his life and constantly engaging in battle with various foes, Superman has over time become an excellent hand-to-hand fighter utilizing a fighting style that directly complements his superpowers. Superman's combat versatility allows him to adapt to any foe and beat them. Additionally, Superman has been trained in boxing by Wildcat, Mongul in Gladiator combative methods, Wonder Woman in wrestling and even learned some advanced martial arts techniques from Batman.

&gt; **Torquasm Vo:** a Kryptonian discipline that Superman uses sometimes. It is basically a means of focusing ones mental discipline to help fight adverse effects such as mental domination. It can be used to manipulate someone's mind. Superman used that ability during his fight against the Eradicator. It was used to create an illusion to let Superman enter inside the Eradicator.


&gt;  **Torquasm Rao:** Allows him to tap into his instincts and separate himself from his body. Makes him able to prevent others from manipulating his mind and allows him to fight on the astral plane.

Although Goku would have more to bring to the table. I can only imagine Superman defeating a very powerful foe with a Spirit Bomb. Then Batman would ask where he learned such a technique and he'd say something cool like ""I learned it from a very good friend.""",2015-07-21 20:58:05+00:00,ctbc5dh,3.0,t1_ctbav4e,1803.0,dbz

Perhaps your dildos could fit in those? [Here](https://youtu.be/698TXVlec3o) is a video of a guy showing how to conceal a paint can inside an Arizona can. You could say its a collectors editon or perhaps do the same with just a paint can. However, if you do use a paint can make sure you punch a small hole in it first to release the pressure inside. Afterward, cut your way around the bottom like in the video but be careful, the aluminum in an aerosol can is tougher than a soda's. After you open your can just let it air dry and its safe to use! Just store the dildo in a small bag or wrap in a cloth and always remember to sanitize before and after every use. Hope I helped!

1899,"&gt; Did you play the last game?

Yes, I did. My friends and I liked it a lot.

&gt; What were the high points and low points?

I wanna say the high points were how unique some of the characters were. Also, the combat system. At first, none of us were fans about the only being killed by specials but as we played more it grew on us. It made the game far more competitive. Everyone scrambling to get their #3 and trying to dodge the others. Loads of fun. We all also really liked how the backgrounds were mashes between games. Another thing I really liked the fact that there were no ring outs. It's so fucking annoying on Smash, especially because some characters just seem to be built to never get back up to the platform which is fukcing stupid. 

The low points were the arcade mode. Nothing special, nothing new. A lot of the time it felt like some specials were OP as fuck (Sweet Tooth, Zeus). Specials should be difficult to dodge, not impossible. They needed more characters and at the time I don't think they had a lot of options. 

&gt; what characters would you add?

Sora (Kingdom Hearts), Laura Croft (Tomb Raider), Vault Hunter with the ability to switch between classes (Borderlands), Lightning or Cloud (Final Fantasy), Subzero, Scorpion, Raiden or Liu Kang (Mortal Kombat), Spyro (Spyro the Dragon). There are a buttload more I want in there but I can't think of them now. 

&gt; what map from any PS game would you like as a stage?

To be honest, I don't give a shit about stages. 

&gt; any other comments?

The game has so much potential to be it's own unique game. Enough that it doesn't get compared to Smash anymore. They just need to take the right steps in the right direction.",2015-07-15 06:27:28+00:00,ct3wdki,1.0,t3_3dbodi,20319.0,playstation

1986,"I'm late as fuck but here goes...

Before I went there: Two kids get in an argument. One stabs the other through the eye with a pencil.

9th grade: Girl breaks up with guy and he spray painted ""TAKE ME BACK CRYSTAL"" all over various buildings on campus. I believe he was arrested.

A teacher I'll call Ms. Foot quit teaching forever because of the shit my class and others of hers did to her. They threw textbooks at her, stole her phone and threw it in the trash, and set her fucking hair on fire. That was her first and last year teaching.

After a blood drive it is revealed that there is a *huge* outbreak of STDs at the senior campus. Some kids end up with HIV.

Race ""War"" as people called it. Mexican and black kids gathered for a huge brawl, The Outsiders style.

Pornographic photographs from the *sixth grade* surface of a girl on the dance team. She didn't really care.

A graffiti crew painted shitty throw ups on the school.

Teacher gets caught by students masturbating to child pornography on his off period. Doesn't make sense as his wife was hot as hell. She divorced him and last I heard he was working at a Sears.

10th grade: A very close friend of mine was involved with some bad people doing bad things. He was murdered.

Its revealed that one of our capmus police officers is in a relationship with a student. Apparently they went to her parents for their blessing and got it. They dated for a while after that.

This girl in my art class had just transferred from a different school district. She had anxiety or something and the stress from being somewhere new caused her to have a seizure in class. Also, the art teacher for that class was old and senile. Someone lied to her that we were getting a two week vacation after a hurricane hit our city and she believed them. She got in so much trouble. 

11th grade: A popular cheerleader gets caught fucking in the stairwell.

Two girls get into a fight. It got really ugly and paramedics were called because one girl bashed the others head into the ground repeatedly, nearly killing her. 

A kid that seemingly had nothing wrong with him commits suicide.

12th grade: kids that were smoking weed in the forest near the school didnt put out their joints and nearly burn everything down.

Kids were smoking weed in the restroom and nearly set it on fire again because they threw a still lit joint into the trash can.

Nudes of a friend of mine get passed around the school. I was shocked.

Kids who weren't going to prom decided to have ""anti-prom"". My friend went thinking it was just going to be a party. Turns out it was a huge sex party. One chick was getting gangbanged, a couple was on the floor fucking and she even got to make out and feel up with another girl iirc.

Some chick gave a guy head during In School Suspension.

After I graduated: Our principal retired and the new one is ushered in. He gets caught with a prostitute on school grounds months later.

A kid goes to school with a weapon intending to kill himself in front of a girl who broke up with him. He got arrested and pulled out *another* gun and shot himself. He survived.

2034,"Well, I initially got interested from some stories I read a long time ago on experience project. They were all about how women lost their men to another woman and were humiliated by being forced to watch them fuck. It also had to do with a mind break kind of thing where the guy would kind of resist until he turned into her new partner. I guess the main focus was losing their man to someone and not being able to do anything about it and being forced to accept it.

2038,I would have to say finding cartoons based on fighting. On cartoon network no less. Up until that point the only people in colored gi's that could kick ass and shoot energy from their hands were Ryu and Ken from SFII. I was amazed and started watching. Luckily I started on the Saiyan saga and kept going. I was six then.. Sixteen years later and I haven't stopped since.,2015-06-22 08:06:24+00:00,cseky0i,1.0,t3_3ao06s,21269.0,dbz
2039,"I remember thinking that Goku was a little out of it thinking Gohan could take cell. Especially when he was crying about not wanting to fight. What made it worse was when Goku kind of realized it a bit after Piccolo yells at him. At that point I already knew that Gohan could do some extraordinary shit when pushed to the edge but he was just a kid fighting a perfect cockroach bio-android with everyone's genes. Before the SS2 I thought ""Shit, well I guess it's up to a spirit bomb or something."" But then #16 gave that speech and he ascended and it got all awesome. Gohan manhandles him, Cell throws up #18, Goku sacrifices himself, Trunks got finger beamed. I was going nuts after he comes back super perfect. Then to top off the battle was a energy beam clash with Gohan doing a *one handed* Kamehameha. I loved it. ",2015-06-22 07:55:49+00:00,cseksld,1.0,t3_3ao19g,20024.0,dbz
