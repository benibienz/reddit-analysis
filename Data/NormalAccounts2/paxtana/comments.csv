68,"It really depends on the depth of your understanding. 

More capacity is better, there's no question of that. But if you end your ride at a different depth of discharge than a lower capacity pack and then charge it? Then you're just shooting yourself in the foot. It may not be a full cycle but you have just cycled the battery. 

The idea is to take it to 80% over one ride, then 60% over another, then 40%, THEN charge it, to maybe 80 or 100%. So one battery cycle lasts multiple rides. 

Either way it's not really an issue with the packs we're discussing here. Both 14ah and 18.9ah is plenty of range for a mid drive, especially with PAS. I got 14ah and I get dozens of miles with bbshd even on singletrack with prototype 50A controller. Personally I would be more concerned over the pack housing. The one from luna-mate is a hardcase pack, which is relatively theft-proof compared to a softpack which someone could steal just by unzipping the bag. If you get the kit from em3ev you will probably want to keep a closer eye on the bike if/when leaving it outside. Even if you tell yourself you will just use it in protected areas the tendency with that much range is to consider it for tasks where you can replace a car, and some of those tasks will be in seedy areas. tl;dr yeah more capacity is better but so is having a hardcase pack since you need to protect your investment not only from degradation but also from theft",2016-10-10 08:21:35+00:00,d8ln8uq,7.0,t1_d8lml1l,2237.0,ebikes

96,"[This is a BBSHD](http://luna-mate.com/luna-mate-bafang-bbshd-1000w-kit).  It's a heavy-duty motor that fits within the bottom bracket shell of the bicycle.  Your usual run-of-the-mill motor such as the ones sold by the two companies you were looking at use big heavy hub motors.  Combined with their big heavy batteries it is not fun.  It does work but it's not exactly what you would consider cutting edge, and the 36 V versions you would get from those two companies are not really impressive, especially in New Zealand where you have some pretty great hills. 

Yes there are power limits but nobody is enforcing those and if you don't act like an ass hole then nobody will ever bother you about it.  If you really wanted to you could buy a program cable and lower the amps so that it actually does put out 300 W, the kit is fully programmable.

The install is pretty easy and we do have installation resources in the sidebar on the right-hand side of this subreddit, hardest thing is just removing the original bottom bracket from the bottom bracket shell on the bike.  We actually have a dealer in New Zealand that can do the install for you if you want: http://wellingtonelectricbikes.co/

As to your other question that you sent me via p.m., like I said I think that best folding bike you could have is a BBSHD built into a paratrooper.  You have all of the torque of a BBSHD which is just amazing, built into something compact and sleek and quiet, on a frame that reinforces its folding mechanism so that it won't wobble when it is at high speeds, which can be a real issue for folding bikes when you put the motor on them.  The paratrooper does not have this issue because it was originally designed for military use and is very reinforced.  Here's a couple of builds if you want to have a look

152,"Until they switch over to their new cell from the Gigafactory they are using regular ncrb. 

Sure tesla can make these cells work well, they're a billion dollar company with the best engineers in the world, working on a use case with lots of space for stuff like heat channels and lots of money for stuff like advanced BMS. 

But I can promise you that if you equally treat an NCRB and GA pack like shit the GA will be way better every time. It is a more forgiving cell to take the sort of abuse that ebikers give it, abuse that a Tesla pack never experiences. 

At Luna we see this fairly regularly. Someone uses a BBSHD or MP5 with a 13.5ah NCRB pack, pulling 25 or even 30A continuous for long time, then seeing thermal shutdown by the BMS and wondering why. Hmm, you think it might be because you're pulling way the fuck too many amps? NCRB cells are rated for 4.85A *at best* and personally I wouldn't take it over 3A, and our 13.5ah packs are 4p so realistically you shouldn't be pulling more than 19A with that pack.

Yeah.. Get your NCRB pack so hot it reaches thermal shutdown on the regular like some ebikers do and let me know how that works out for your cycle life. You simply do not have this issue with GA, it'll take high performance use and keep on truckin, nice and cool. It's a fucking beast. I'm not saying it's perfect but it's better than anything else for our uses.

&gt;Airwheel, a senior pioneer in the commuting vehicle field has released a new type of product to support its eco commuting concepts, named E6 electric bicycle, with features like agility, portability and intelligence that will make a good company on the road. Airwheel E6 smart electric bike can be considered as the flagship product in intelligent vehicles and worth the appreciation for its extraordinary performances. This is an intelligent E-bike in new era. 

&gt;Differentiated from traditional electromobiles, Airwheel E6 electric bike kit is much more light-weighted and portable. E6, made of aluminum alloy, is light and portable with 14.15kg item weight. What’s more, its main body, saddle, handle bars and pedals can be folded, so that it can be easily carried into buses, subways and trains etc. Women riders can lift it without burden. People who live not far from offices can ride it to work and it will save time and energy. Children can ride it to school. Portability has been the most distinctive and advantageous feature of E6. 

&gt;Meanwhile, Airwheel E6 battery operated bicycle, similar to all existing Airwheel products, is powered by clean energy. E6 is coupled with car-level Li-ion battery set, light and delicate. Also, an USB port is added to the battery. Imported Li-ion battery guarantees sufficient power supply. The USB port can provide prover to other daily electronics.  

&gt;Airwheel E6 foldable **[intelligent e bike](http://www.airwheel.net/home/products)** is presented as an X-shape. Light and stable X shaped design enables the light body to bear 100KG load, a remarkable combination of structure and material. In addition, the mobile App of Airwheel has an upgrade in Airwheel E6. App fault self-diagnosis guarantees your safety before travelling. Combined with the attentive intelligent design to set the speed level, riding Airwheel E6 is safe and comfortable, as it is equipped with rubber saddle in left-right design with balanced force and good ventilation.

&gt; Can it reliably handle the upper end of that rating? 

Yes but the controller is the weakest point of the cyclone kit. You could upgrade the controller later if you need.

I would think it better to just keep it at something reasonable like 60v then let the controller take as many amps as your controller can provide, rather than trying for highest voltage. Luna's MXUS controller is pretty cheap and at 60v 60amp that's 3600w.

Also this is not a budget build, make no mistake. It requires a big battery, maybe more than your budget allows. We're talking *at a minimum* a 20ah high discharge battery capable of 40amp continuous. Also highly recommended to get a cycle analyst because this bike comes with no display. Cycle analysts cost upwards of $100. 

Oh, and the motor will be pulling so many amps from that big battery at full throttle that even though it is high capacity it will be empty in a half hour. 

On the other hand you don't have to worry about chainline issues which is a huge plus in its favor, you only have to build it once, you could limit amps with a cycle analyst (for more $$), and style is overrated, and you can use dual front chainring so no compromising between torque and topspeed.

Lower quality batteries have a lower C rate, meaning they will be damaged if they are recharged at high current (fast charging). They also cannot discharge as quickly without damage so discharge current is limited, so you have less acceleration when you really need it. 

Interestingly this stuff also applies to Tesla cells, any lithium cells really, just less so with quality. If you solely fast charge a Tesla all the time it will have a lower cycle life than a slow charged Tesla.

But I see your point now, in that flagging a site like EBR as spam would be problematic. Maybe leaving it at blacklisting outright promotion is enough, or deletion without flagging as spam when in doubt. 

Another approach would be to set a keyword-based automoderator message linking back to this thread or the fakespot screenshot, so if the company ever comes up in conversation whoever is discussing it is automatically informed that the company is not trustworthy without resorting to censorship. I just wonder if people would find this tedious since it would show up after every comment with the word freway in it.

As far as implying EBR / Court Rye is biased, I doubt it. He's usually such a positive guy that calling their range claim bullshit is possibly the most harsh criticism I've ever heard from him in a review.

Complex multidisciplinary fields always seem fringe to a layman, but even moreso with a field suffering from what one Cambridge professor dubbed [the reputation trap.](https://aeon.co/essays/why-do-scientists-dismiss-the-possibility-of-cold-fusion)  

And nor does it go against fundamental physics. Muon catalyzed fusion has been well accepted for half a century and it causes fusion at nearly room temperature, does this violate the laws of physics? No. It simply does not attempt to brute-force the Coulomb Barrier like hot fusion does, instead employing a more clever method, just like LENR. 

Imagine if people had been spending decades smashing cars together and concluding it takes X amount of energy to rupture the gas tank, and they had whole books all about the math involved. Then one day some clever guy says he can do it with less energy, and drills a hole in the tank to rupture it. This would not go against those old books on how much energy it takes to do a very different approach, it just happens to be irrelevant to that particular methodology. Nothing magical about it, just a less primitive way of accessing that energy than smashing stuff together. 

And it's really not as fringe as you may think either. It has become very popular in the last few years as positive results continue to pile up. [Hell, it was even hypothesized by Einstein.](http://nautil.us/issue/7/waste/einsteins-lost-hypothesis)

&gt; There's still no way two guys with minimal capital are going to be the ones to achieve more progress than everyone else in the field 

I did say it would take capital. But probably not as much as you might think considering how many replications are done on a small budget. A big part of that is the willingness of researchers on places like lenr-forum to be very open and share data, along with easier methodologies that do away with deuterium in favor of loading hydrogen into transition metals, and most of these low energy reactions produce comparatively low energy particles like thermal neutrons, that can be easily shielded from with something you can build in a garage. 

Not to say it is like that in all cases though, there was a recent preliminary report on lenr-forum of a replicator trying a tungsten plasma reactor and getting a ridiculous amount of radiation even days after the reactor was shut down, so despite getting about 50 times as much energy out as in, he abandoned this avenue of research in favor of safer reactors. At least the plasma [was quite pretty.](https://i.imgur.com/foPTdRT.jpg) I expect types like these to be mostly developed in universities with big budgets but the more commonplace safe reactor types are still ripe for some breakthroughs.

399,"Yeah it is already a nice bike, I can see why you would not want to go overboard. If it were me I would just replace the gears in the motor and sell the bike, use that money to build a better one from scratch. I'm going to go over a few things you should know and you can make up your own mind. 

OK so let's say you replace the hub. Whether or not you go with a higher wattage you then need to [go over dozens of wire combinations](https://www.reddit.com/r/ebikes/comments/4ilfcc/how_hall_sensors_work_in_electric_motors/d2zgumb) coming from the controller to make sure you have the right one. And if the connector is not the same to fix that as well. 

Now let's say you reprogram the controller for higher power. The battery does not list its C-rate, its maximum discharge rate or anything like that. [Even in the manual on the manufacturer's website.](http://store.ecoride.se/EcoRide_Handbook_ENG_2014_web.pdf) And since high discharge batteries cost more we can assume they used the lowest discharge batteries that would work at the current it was originally built for. Therefore it is likely that doubling the current by messing with the controller will dramatically shorten the battery's cycle life. 

And this is assuming reprogramming works and you do not need to replace controller, which would create more issues besides replacing the hub, checking wiring configuration, fixing connectors, and making peace with the fact that this will kill your expensive battery. 

Here is my proposed alternative, which in comparison is simple. 

* [This is how you open the hub and remove the gears.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pH-52IgJui8) Easy. 
* [These are the gears they are replaced with.](http://www.greenbikekit.com/index.php/electric-motor/rear-bldc-1/bafang-8fun-bldc-hub-motor-nylon-gears-replacement.html) Cheap.

Adding a higher wattage motor by itself will do nothing, the electrical stuff is what actually makes it more powerful.

It would make more sense to build a new ebike with a kit than to retrofit a factory built ebike's electrical system for higher power. You could keep the frame and use that with the 500w kit if you like the style.

442,"Hard to go wrong with a kit, the best ones are often plug and play. 

Stronger motor is kind of a misnomer. For the motor itself you have its rating, this is just how much power the factory thinks it can handle, which they always underestimate. While not what I would consider 'stronger', the design of the motor can add more torque and climbing ability though, compared to a hub of equal power. Like if it has internal gears (geared hub) or if it drives the chain and external gears (mid drive). You are probably a perfect candidate for a mid drive if you can afford it and don't mind an extra couple installation steps.  

Battery's voltage influences how much power your ebike has, and the controller determines how many amps it pulls from the battery. You need a battery that can handle the amps the controller wants. You can go with a battery that has higher amps than the controller needs but you cannot go with a battery that has higher volts than the controller can handle. 

Now a higher power *kit* is definitely higher torque and higher top speed regardless, and adding more aH battery while keeping voltage the same will increase the capacity but not torque. 

There are links in the sidebar that give good explanations, it's a lot simpler than it seems.

443,"I have one of those. It is proprietary parts, not a kit so you cannot simply swap out parts for higher power stuff. It will not slide onto the mount, not without some custom work, and the controller may not like the extra voltage either.. yes it would theoretically give more torque, though amps do that more than volts and the stock controller will not pull more amps. Your options are:

* extensive custom work on the battery mount/controller so it can use better battery, not worth the effort
* replace the 36v DD hub with a 36v geared hub, probably not too difficult and will give reasonably more torque
* add a second kit and battery for the front wheel and wire into the existing throttle so it is all wheel drive, fairly easy but expensive
* sell the bike and build something with a mid drive or geared hub kit

The best option is the most expensive and hardest of course, building a whole new bike from the ground up with a mid drive kit. But you know, a BBSHD build will cost about 2000 bucks so it's not for everyone. Next best would be probably adding a second motor for front, run you about 400 for a front 36v kit with battery from greenbikekit or wherever. Swapping out the current motor on the prodeco for a 36v geared hub would only be like 150, maybe 100 if you get it direct from china. You'd have to solder a few wires from the original hub onto the new one to keep the original plug but it doesn't look too hard.",2016-05-09 22:36:00+00:00,d2z6s0x,1.0,t3_4ik50c,24645.0,ebikes

452,"He is referring to hall sensor issues, something the media doesn't really understand or report accurately on, and blew it out of proportion. 

Hall sensor is a $2 part that can fail in all electric hubmotors, basically the only thing inside these motors that can fail because the rest is just a big electromagnet with zero moving parts. The motor still runs without it in sensorless mode but it loses some efficiency since the field is not optimized. Tesla probably has a notification system built in that alerts the driver they need maintenance if one fails, so they can do the easy repair of putting in new and redundant sensor systems or just swapping out the motor entirely, either way is simple. New versions probably have more redundancy but hall sensors will probably always be something you need to be aware of with any electric car.

We deal with them on ebikes sometimes. Repair just involves removing the cover, snipping the sensor out with wire cutters, gluing a new one in same position and crimping the wires together. It is dead simple, you could probably do it in an hour with no training or special tools. ",2016-05-09 07:18:15+00:00,d2ycq44,7.0,t1_d2y1csi,23866.0,technology

&gt; New York is one of the least backwards and least conservative states in the country.  

I know they like to think of themselves that way.

477,"&gt; My update: I have tested plasma based reactor for longer period of time.. Results are clear.
&gt; Unfortunately the power that is under the lid is so strong I will probably not continue in this area.
&gt; Reactor is emmiting neutrons a few days after the test!
&gt; 
&gt; With lithium COP might be exceptionally higher. Very rough estimate is COP of 10-50.
&gt; But I am not skilled enough to be absolutely sure about safety which is reason why I will continue with reactors that are more safe.
&gt; Emmissions (RF, electrons and UV) during the test were so strong that my control circuit was absolutely crazy even that it was 3 meters away - it is unusable.
&gt; 
&gt; Now I am playing with dangerous things that are clearly working.
&gt; 
&gt; I am afraid, but LENR is not safe as it looked initially. You can make a nuclear reactor with all the things you really don't want.
&gt; Fortunately it can't get out of control so easily. If power output is limited, you are safe.
&gt; But there will be probably always some kind of potentionally harmfull radiation. Fuel and fuel chamber must be very clean from impurities to not get unwanted products.
&gt; 
&gt; Now I understand perfectly why Rossi is working on the e-cat so long. You have something that is working, you have a prototypes and you are nearly ready for mass production. Then you will find something amazing, that can increase the excess heat significantly so that previous work is not important anymore. But there are again many difficulties and unknown things that it can take a few years to get a fully working prototype based on the new discoveries, but it is surely worth. You can continue endlessly, because LENR is opening doors of something completely unknown and much more. not just energy conversion. It is possible that in 10 years, everything will be completely different. 

&gt; Reactor B - testing a pure discharge without modulation and then testing modulated plasma with partially visible balmer series.
During the excess heat plasma is looking really cool - not possible to describe with a words. Separated into a thin slices (chunks).

Wiring is easy, when you get the wheel take pics of the wires coming out of the motor and the wires on the controller/battery, and measure their width.

Remove one wire at a time from the original connector on the battery, leaving the others uncut so you don't short something.

500,"&gt; Regulation of ebikes would likely mean recurring costs for insurance and registration rather than regulations on speed or wattage- which already exist. 

I think you misunderstood. I was referring to *enforcement* of existing regulations. We do not have lax regulations, but we do have lax enforcement of existing regulations since there are so few of us, meaning that many can indeed build an illegally powerful ebike for commuting and fly under the radar. That was always bound to stop at some point once we reach critical mass and if you want to spend your days in fear I suppose that is a rational thing to be afraid of. 

But not increased regulation. China does not count because their idea of an ebike is essentially a motorcycle, at double or even triple the weight due to all the lead acid and illegally modded they would dangerously drive these things on sidewalks and bike paths, acting like asshats just like what caused the ban in NYC. It had nothing to do with the political climate of a particular region or how many ebikes are there, it was lack of enforcement and lack of people acting responsibly, which China is notorious for on a whole other level compared to the USA; it is not uncommon to see people in China do really vile stuff like shitting on the sidewalk or cooking with oil removed from sewers. Meanwhile Europe also has a great many more ebikes than the USA and guess what no compulsory licensing. 

&gt; I understand too well the dire consequences of not taking gas guzzlers off the road and I also know why everyone cannot own a Tesla.

Do you? You are talking about making solutions work economically but CO2 may very well destroy the economy and society with it. We do not have the luxury of waiting, and we certainly do not have the luxury of massive public works projects. There is a reason why infrastructure sucks in America, it is very expensive. The proposed plan calls for a $10M subsidy, you could not even build a single citywide bike network for that cost, certainly not one with dedicated concrete-divided lanes like they have in western europe. To do that across the entire country would cost hundreds of billions of dollars. Meanwhile that $10M in the subsidy program could get 20,000 people out of their cars, resulting in immediate emissions reductions of up to 166,400,000 pounds of CO2 per year. 

As to the extremist who plays off of racial fears for votes, it is irrelevant. Presidents do not pass legislation, regardless of whatever he tells the fools who buy into that stuff. The real driving force behind legislation is not even congress at this point but the corporations who bribe them with campaign contributions. Ebikes are already big business in this country and the companies selling them can always buy a few congressmen if they feel proposed laws threaten their business model.

And there is probably not enough lithium in the world to replace all those cars with Teslas, nor could we make them fast enough to avoid widespread destruction, and that's if billions could even afford them regardless of incentives. In short, to reach widespread carbon reduction we *need* to encourage widespread electric transportation modes that are orders of magnitude more energy efficient and affordable.

Generally yes it  will fit but but it will be bumpy and won't stop well without upgrades. The frame material is probs steel which is fine, nice and strong. The lack of suspension would necessitate a suspension seatpost. The rim brakes would need to have better stopping material at a minimum, like kool stop pads. So that's like an extra 50 bucks that you could instead put to just getting a used MTB which would be better. 

You're not stupid for trying it, and not the first to use an old bike to start with. Just fair warning that it will be decidedly not awesome. 

The gear cables are fine. The motor can be twisted in the bottom bracket so it is oriented to not contact that area before tightening the bolts.

The homemade bracket is not stiff enough. At low throttle the homemade bracket works fine but the more power you put into it the more the chain wants to fight to pull to the side it would originally be at if there were no chainguide. I am not confident it wouldn't derail at full throttle when in that gear. (course at full throttle in that gear you'd probably wheelie and flip the bike over but still it's a design flaw)

The good news is that out of the three pulley types I tried this one is by far the best. Hard and spins well, though the color is shitty. The others I've tried are either too soft or have awful bearings. 

I think you can see some other brackets I've posted in that thread that I hopefully will get to try soon, if only for the sake of stubbornness. Ultimately though I will probably ditch the mini and go for a 42 tooth chainring.

It's a shame though isn't it, like you want the mini for torque but it is seemingly impossible to use the gear that would give you the most torque, thus negating the whole point of the mini in the first place.

528,"Well you got [Brillouin](http://brillouinenergy.com/), which is a nickel/hydrogen reactor slated to be commercially available by the end of the year IIRC. They have the distinction of being the only company to be validated by Stanford (SRI). 

There is also [Nichenergy/Metalenergy](http://www.nichenergy.com/), also nickel/hydrogen, founded by Piantelli who was one of the pioneers of this reactor type. He has patents and is well respected in the field but lack of funding seems to be holding him up. 

Then you have the E-cat by [Leonardo](http://ecat.com/), again nickel/hydrogen. This is by far the most well funded and the only company to actually turn a profit, though not without much controversy. Of the mentioned companies this one has the most people trying independent replications based off their published patents. Not all have been successful but several have seen excess heat, radiation and isotope shifts. This reactor also has the highest claimed output and was the subject of a recently concluded yearlong pilot project as well as an ongoing lawsuit. While the licensee seems to be in no mood to pay the rest of what is owed the customer is ordering more powerplants so there's that. 

So those are the ones to keep an eye on. You also have [BLP](http://brilliantlightpower.com/), who promise a commercial reactor by end of next year. This one is very different, using silver particles and water to create light. Not sure how commercially applicable it is for power generation or what the claimed coefficient of performance is but it's interesting at least. 

Other fun stuff.. 

* [Looking for heat](http://www.lookingforheat.com/), which sells prototype reactor test kits to researchers. This is the only reactor commercially being sold to the general public right now. It is meant to be a standardized testbed for researchers to experiment on. 
* lenr-forum's me356 has reportedly been very successful with his e-cat replications and has very interesting plans for working test reactors within the year that can enter self-sustain mode and put out about 3 times as much energy as it uses. 
* Another development is a reactor based on nickel wires developed by Francesco Celani, a well respected physicist at Italy's National Institute of Nuclear Physics. Very simple, this may be a prime candidate for further technological development. The wires put out gamma radiation and have a COP of ~2. 
* Larsen of the Widom-Larsen theory runs Lattice Energy LLC, a consulting firm. I would not be surprised if he plays a role in companies furthering their development. His theory explaining LENR is the one endorsed by NASA and he helped them design their successful experiments. 
* Likewise with Edmund Storms, a prolific LENR writer who is currently working with researchers who left Los Alamos national laboratory to come work with him on developing new LENR investigations.

No matter what it is nice to get a complete kit from Luna since they'll match the connectors for battery/motor so you don't have to solder connectors, or crimp them, splice them, etc. 

Yeah BB installation is easy. You can post a pic of the BB on here or ES and get any specific support you need, what kinda tool you need or whatever. Really can't go wrong when there's thousands of people willing to help out. Wiki has a FAQ for the bbs series too. 

I don't know what the use case is so I cannot make a recommendation on whether BBSHD is the way to go. For a simple commuter and light trail use on regular hills a regular DD hub is fine, or a geared if you have some bigger hills. 

The bbshd on the other hand can deliver low speed torque better than a dirtbike and climb mountains all day or as long as the battery holds out. Even the BBS02 has enough power to pop wheelies just by hitting the throttle, and the BBSHD is about twice as powerful as that. It's a great replacement for a dirtbike, or an addon for a downhill bike so you can climb to the top quick and just enjoy the ride back down. But on a commuter, on flat streets running errands? In that case it would be kinda pointless since you're mostly just going to be hitting wide open throttle in the highest gear. And there are a lot more moving parts in a mid drive so it's like, unless you will have a need to be shifting the motor into other gears it may make sense just to have it be a hub. On the other hand the bbshd is very versatile even on streets, as long as you have enough power to handle it. It uses more amps than the other options discussed, at wide open throttle it could use up Luna's biggest shark pack in something like 45 minutes. Really depends on what you want to do. 

You might be able to use that integrated stuff. Some places sell a universal ebrake, or the Bafang Hidden Wire Ebike Sensor. One uses a magnet to determine the lever's position and cuts off power when it moves, the other attaches to the wire and shuts if off when the wire moves. I heard it can be a bit flaky though and it might make sense just to use a new shifter and actual ebrake. Yes you should use ebrakes, you can read a bit about why [here.](https://www.electricbike.com/ebike-braking-essentials/)

Then there is stuff that comes completely out of left field like the emdrive which, while not even relating to energy, would enable previously unattainable energy projects like low cost solar farms at the L1 lagrange point beaming the energy back to earth via microwave. 

The whole notion of disruptive technology is based on the development of something that was not predicted, cannot be predicted. Often a product that many didn't even think was possible. Experts do not game nearly as extensively as you think because they risk their reputation including technologies that are not widely believed to be credible.

534,"No problem. Rain is not an issue. Hubs are indestructible as long as you don't run too much power through them. This applies more to DD hubs than geared but still, hubs are sealed from water in a few clever ways. If you store it at the bottom of a pool you might consider opening the cover and letting it dry out, maybe putting some new grease in there, but that's about it. There's not really electronics in that hub, just a few wires leading to electromagnets and some gears. 

The controller is more vulnerable but you can take measures if it's a real sticking point. But let me put it this way, on this subreddit we have never had a single person mention having their controller fried from regular use during rainstorms. There are some things you can do to make it even more waterproof if you want, I'll put a few threads below you can read up on for suggestions. A frame bag may be helpful sure. You may want to cut a hole in the bottom of the bag and run the wires through the bottom (some even put a fancy grommet there so it looks nice) that way the top isn't exposed and water won't pool if any gets in.

540,"I'll take a crack at answering a few questions :)  Don't worry, it's a lot more straightforward than it seems. 

You can put the controller wherever you want, under a rack, under the downtube, maybe even hanging from the top tube if the cable stretches that far. Some folks put it along the seat tube on the inside of the triangle which I think is a nice look if you can manage to put the battery in the triangle too. 

You cannot use your cassette, sorry, hubmotors usually only take a freewheel. The reasoning being that the ratcheting mechanism may eventually wear out necessitating replacement of the hub instead of simply a new freewheel. 

The kit will take any battery, she probably only needs the 48v (which will be better for range anyway, faster the bike the faster you run out of battery). The different cases have the same features, mostly just a matter of what size works for you. It helps to measure out the dimensions on a piece of cardboard, cut it out and hold it up to the triangle to physically get an idea of how you can manage it. 

Pedal assist is overrated but there is an option if you care to add it, in the related products tab on that page. If she truly wants to combine pedal/motor maybe PAS is the way to go though, I dunno, I mostly alternate unless on a hill. There's no learning curve to a throttle, I agree thumb throttle is better. 

Yeah the controller is an important detail, I doubt your girlfriend is hotrodding it so the most important thing here is the current. See on the controller options where it's like 25A, 30A, 40A? That will influence the bike's overall power level, how fast it uses up the battery, speed and torque. Also you need to keep in mind a high amp controller needs a battery that can deliver high amps, or it will reduce the battery's life. The 25A controller is fine, at 48V that's 1200 watts which is already overkill (in fact if it were me I would probably add their 3 speed switch so she has the option to scale the power back if she wants to, which would put it into a street legal power level at the lower setting.)

Anyway yeah it's a good kit, not too many durable geared kits out there that can take higher power levels. Course if she does not want high power or wants it to be strictly street legal you could go with one of those new [bafang mini hubs from ebikes.ca](http://www.ebikes.ca/shop/conversion-kits/bafang-mini/front-mini-geared-kit-advanced-pas.html) which would be 500W when combined with Luna's 48v pack, and would definitely get there quicker since they are located in canada. Really depends on how much power you want to put in there, though a 500w will be more frugal with the battery use and therefore range so that's something to think about too I guess.

The best BMS settings don't even charge to 100%, instead keeping the battery within a band of 20-80% capacity which dramatically increases battery life.

Do you use fast charging? That can fuck up the battery too, I try not to use it unless I need to. These are not high C rate batteries.

&gt; Lithium-ion batteries are stabilized by an ultrathin protective film that is 10–50 nanometres thick and coats both electrodes. Here we artifically simulate the 'thermal-runaway' conditions that would arise should this coating be destroyed, which could happen in a battery large enough to overheat beyond 80 °C. We find that under these conditions the reaction of the battery electrolyte with the material of the unprotected positive electrode results in the formation of toxic fluoro-organic compounds. Although not a concern for the small units used in today's portable devices, **this unexpected chemical hazard should be taken into account as larger and larger lithium-ion batteries are developed, for example for incorporation into electric-powered vehicles.**

Since it was a turn the rear was already somewhat out to one side, so when I hit the brake it wanted to keep going to that side.

Sorry friend, your post was stuck in the spam filter since reddit does not like link shorteners. Please link directly in the future. 

Don't know how many people will see this now so long after the fact, but maybe I can help. 

The short answer is those bikes are awful. Low power, overstated range, old style. One of them doesn't even have rear brakes just front rim brakes, which is dangerous. 

At full throttle 24 volt ebikes will struggle to move a 200lb person unless pedaling. I can almost guarantee you the battery will have much less charge cycles than advertised too, that's always the case with these cheapo bikes. 

What your son needs is a 48v ebike or 36v at a minimum. If you are set on a cheapo bike then you could get Sondors Thin for less than the ones you were looking at, which would at least be better components but still too low powered in my opinion. 

Maybe you should talk with crazy lenny, he's been posting some deals on the promo page for name brand 48v ebikes at under 1000. [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/ebikes/comments/4clohf/weekly_rebikes_promo_thread_march_30_2016/d1ku66b). Any of these would be much better than the cheapo bikes.

Egalitarian idealism is lovely but if something is derailing work then it is the organization's job to do something about it. The best ones will find balance between moderating behavior and allowing expression, using well thought out strategies.

This means the pack would have to be moved up more, closer to the tire front tire. This may rub against the pack so it must be as low as possible. 

Options: 

* may need to add spacers to the side to move the bbshd over (in my case 5mm would work)
* The p clamps should provide a nice advantage to drilled rivnuts due to the ability to shift them to the side by a few mm. 
* Longer front suspension forks.

I picked up some P clamps to start, we'll see how well they fit and whether the whole thing can be further supported with hose clamps along the side if necessary. Turns out there are already 3 holes in the back of the bracket for mounting to that increases the odds it will be more sturdy without needing more work, so that's nice. 

Next thing to worry about is how the battery itself is held onto the bracket. It's only on there with six little plastic tabs that were never meant to support weight upside down. With the weight spread out each tab will have about a pound pulling down on it. Not too bad but I think I will see if it can be reinforced by coating the tabs with jb weld so they don't shear off when doing big jumps.

On the other hand I have not used those larger clamps, maybe the metal is more stiff. 

I do like the notion that I could drill holes into the middle of the clamp and put the M5 screws through, effectively mounting the clamps into place in an extra way. Don't think I could do that with a hose clamp.

On the other hand with a hose clamp if it feels loose you can just tighten up, something the P clamp is less capable at. But that's assuming you can even thread the hose clamp through the bracket like that without the battery hitting it when sliding on. I need high resolution pics of the mounting bracket, and the underside of the shark pack, and how those two interface.

691,"Yeah, the 02 has had a few reliability issues, and the HD pretty much makes it obsolete. You can have it sent to you configured to use the same wattage as the 02 if you wanted, and you would see a small boost in range since the motor's bigger so it struggles a little less. If you want exact numbers on range improvement [you can ask Luna here.](http://electricbike.com/forum/) It's not a bad way to go if you can afford it, definitely preferable to the bbs02 in every way.

Course it may go without saying, but if reliability is a big concern you may want to just pick one of those cheap direct drive hub motor kits and save the 500 bucks. That's really the standard for commuter ebikes on flat land. Those hubs are just so simple, reliable, and easily maintained. With mid drives you got many moving parts, the chain stretches out, there's wear on your gears, you gotta be careful shifting under power. That's a lot of stuff that could go wrong, and the kicker is that all that stuff's unnecessary if you're mostly just throttling along on surface streets to commute to work. You really can do something like that just as well with a hub, even better since you're not going to snap a chain or something and have to walk it to work.  Even hilly biking or trails isn't that bad ebiking with a hubmotor ebike, as long as you got a big enough battery capacity that you don't run out of juice and you're rocking at least 48V. 

Don't get me wrong, you would probs be happy with the bbshd if that's your choice. But it's like the difference between a Toyota Camry and a Jaguar. One is the reliable boring choice that gets you from point a to point b, the other is more fun but requires more maintenance.

703,"Sounds like those critiques are based on older technology. Mid drive kits don't whine, use less power than ever before, have no drag because it's not a hub motor, are much smaller and less weight, have increased torque since it drives the chainring and therefore takes advantage of the bike's gears, and everything electrical is waterproof and fully potted. 

As far as the batteries, with the new panasonic 18650b cells you can build a kilowatt pack into a size as small as a few soda cans that weighs 9 pounds. On a mid drive that would take you well over a hundred miles and is much less than the weight of a single lead acid battery. The weight difference is negligible to add a couple more to a trailer and have a range of 300+ miles. 

Solar panels as well are larger and better, a 300W roof panel is more than enough to keep a pack trickle charged if you keep the drive on a lower assist level. Something like a Bosch mid drive only uses 350 watts of energy anyway, at that usage level you would hardly even use the battery if you had a 300W panel. Something [like this](http://swtimes.com/news/solar-powered-bicyclist-treks-across-country-stops-fort-smith) has been done repeatedly, with entire cross-country trips. Not the motor I would use but the idea is sound. 

Look I get the idea of self sufficiency and all that, but the video's about towing a big heavy trailer for many miles. And on top of that you would really want a flat-resistant option, which increases rolling resistance. My ebike uses armored tires, thick tubes and a self-healing liquid that automatically fixes flats, I never get flats anymore but I could never consider such options if I didn't have some electrical assistance. And maybe it's not about getting there fast but if I couldn't at least try to keep pace with traffic I am not sure I would want to take that on most of the surface streets in my area, where cars are whizzing by at 40MPH. Rocking 5 MPH up a hill in busy traffic while everyone else around you is going ten times faster, well that's just got to increase the danger to yourself and others.

Here are a couple suggestions for adapters that add disc brake capability to front and rear. I do not know if they will fit your frame but your retrofitting options for disc brakes are very few. Your local bike shop might have other suggestions too, like in at least attaching a rim brake mounted into the fender or something, I heard a bike mechanic talk about doing that once but hell if I know what to search for to find a product that accomplishes that task.

Yeah battery prices are coming down all the time but we still got a ways to go. With lipo you can simply take a couple of those $50 22v 10ah multistar packs and connect in parallel [with this](http://lunacycle.com/connectors/xt90-parallel-adaptor-run-2-batteries-as-one/) to double the voltage to an appropriate 46v or thereabouts, so it is a $100 10ah lithium pack. Add [a 20 dollar charger](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idproduct=74030) and you're done. Not terribly safe but still might be worth considering when you decide to ditch the lead. That lead's just going to be a bitch to mount, you know?

755,"I checked what my more electrically educated friends had to say about it when the graphene lipos first came out, the specific term I should have used is IR Rating. 

&gt; **Internal Resistance. The Lipo Cells (as do all other Batterys) lose not only total capacity but also their internal resistance goes up so you get less voltage and can't pull out as much amps as when they are new. These new  ones basically have an incredibly low IR increase over those 900 cycles, meaning you can still pull out a lot of Amps, the voltage doesn't drop by much just the overall capacity is 15% less which is also amazing. At the same usage levels, normal lipos are basically dead at 600 cycles.**

So yes performance degrades but perhaps not in the way we would normally expect, and it does seem to be due to high current draw (probably also due to ""fast charging""). Very good news for battery powered transportation options.

758,"I get what you mean but don't think the usefulness is the issue. To me forcing people to do things is rather extreme and in this case unjustified. If people had to go around getting insurance policies for every dangerous hobby or interest they had some people would be spending their entire paycheck on dozens of policies. 

Yes it's not spendy, but a burden is still a burden. And there are burdens other than financial. It means there would be enforcement and greater oversight on ebike activities, conceivably leading to a situation where cops harass you on your ride to check if you're insured. They already do these sort of spot checks in the UK to make sure ebikes people are riding aren't modified to be some useful speed, and I gotta say, if I lived there that would make me give up ebiking for good. In another scenario if you have an accident you may need to run away even if it's not your fault if you're not insured. 

And there would be situations where people would not be insured, make no mistake about it. Putting aside the people who would not sign up due to the difficulty in thorough enforcement, there are many people who simply are not insurable. Maybe they live off the grid, don't have ID, don't have an address, don't have bank accounts and so on. One of the great things about ebikes is how there is simply no hassle to using them, it is truly one of the few motorized personal transportation options available to the people on the fringes of society where they can move around without being criminalized due to any number of unfortunate choices or life situations, intentional or not. So the people that need them the most would be possibly turned into outlaws simply for riding a bike. 

The thing that really bugs me too is those accident numbers they are using to justify this overreach. 1000 accidents per year. And they even say it like that's supposed to impress me, as if it were a big number when it is not. It is a drop in the bucket compared to the huge statistics for injuries from all sorts of other things, and the only reason anyone even notices it is because they are different and new.

762,"No. [IH is run by a billionaire CEO that's successfully run about a hundred companies.](http://fortune.com/2015/09/27/ceo-cherokee-investment-partners-low-energy-nuclear-reaction/)  The man you are talking about licensed his tech to the company but it's a huge stretch to say he runs it. IH also works with other LENR companies like [Brillouin Energy](http://brillouinenergy.com/), which has been verified by SRI (Stanford University). They use the same underlying mechanisms as the E-Cat, but do not have as many patents nor are they as far along in terms of development. The basic idea of this reactor wasn't created by either company though, it goes back decades to professors Piantelli and Focardi. These are simply a particular kind of refinement. 

We have seen several independent experiments that have successfully done replications of the tech used by these companies based on the patents. We have seen this company operate a massive reactor 24/7 creating about a million dollar's worth of energy over the course of a year, all while constantly monitored by a company hired to validate and specifically make sure there's no fraud. The latest replication was done by the MFMP under the live open science approach where all data is available and all experiments are streamed realtime. You cannot create radioactive emissions without a nuclear reaction, and if you prepare a replication in the way the patent described you indeed get gamma. You even get nuclear transmutation if the reaction goes long enough, which is also impossible without a nuclear reaction. Even Einstein hypothesized that LENR was possible.  

These same principles are being used in Japan right now to develop methods to do remediation on the whole toxic Fukushima mess. Leading LENR researchers from Mitsubishi and Toyota are working on it in conjunction with Tohoku university. To imply the stuff at IH does not work is to imply that none of these or the thousands of successful experiments were legit, which is absurd. I know it seems hard to believe to the casual observer but it's true. Right now the biggest problem the field has to overcome is [the reputation trap.](https://aeon.co/essays/why-do-scientists-dismiss-the-possibility-of-cold-fusion) Not experimental data or even replications, which are supposed to be the gold standard of science.

The reactions are so low powered (compared to fission) that the harmful gamma/xray emissions are re-absorbed by the casing of the reactor and thermalised into heat, but under some circumstances like an intentional uncontrolled meltdown it can get beyond the shield, so it may take some convincing for regulators to accept that it is an acceptable risk.

* http://california-ebike.com/product/tektro-dorado-hd-e710-hydraulic-front-disc-brake-kit/

Built from the ground up for ebikes. You replace your entire setup with the kit but its higher quality than whatever hydraulics came with your bike.

&gt; Just a gentle squeeze and I was instantly slowed to a stop. The built in lever reed switches cut off motor power for added safety. After hundreds of miles I began to appreciate the value of an e-brake designed specifically for the needs of an e-bike. The added girth of 2.3mm rotor thickness compared to standard 1.8mm thickness of standard bike rotors combined with larger calipers and larger brake pads seen here made my bike stop like a disc brake motorcycle. I was able to stop on a dime with confidence and added safety. Yes, e-bikes should have e-brakes. It is an investment, but one well worth it. 

Luna sells a hydraulic Shimano ebrake set if you prefer to keep the rotor you got and want to save a few bucks. Might be a little long though, and it's not plug and play for BBS systems.

849,"Short answer: it depends largely on the size of the sub and the location of the bulk of its userbase. 

/all/new gets so much traffic now it is basically useless, and especially at night the signal to noise ratio is just ridiculous. So 'the knights of new' as they were called, are essentially nonexistent, at night anyway. This leaves it up to the subscribers on that subreddit. 

Let's say your sub gets the most amount of traffic at about 1 PM EST on Monday, and it is large enough that submissions do not get automatically frontpaged like often happens on small subs of only a few thousand people. If your post is good enough to garner upvotes 1% of uniqs during peak time that's pretty good, but during a time when most of the userbase is asleep that same 1% is practically nothing even though it is just as popular as a percentage as it was in the daytime.

Would you say a freewheel is more durable in this regard? I'm replacing the spokes and rim anyway so just figured any old cheap thing would be better than what's on there since I'll already have everything taken apart, but maybe I'm wrong.

I bet you're right it needs some grease. The bike is brand new, never ridden. The front hub which I have already replaced had a semi-random grinding noise when turning it, the rear is not as bad just feels like a lot of resistance when turning. I just watched some videos on adjusting cones to see what you mean and I'm not sure the stock hubs have that, though I do see the Deore I put on the front does.

Thanks for the link to the spacer, I saw a comment in the Deore reviews that it needs a 4.5mm but seems like most places only carry 4mm. Most of the spacers I see while I'm reading about this stuff seem to have added bits of metal [like this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/BIKE-BICYCLE-ALLOY-HUB-CASSETTE-SPACER-4MM-USE-7-SPEED-CASSETTE-ON-8-SPEED-HUB-/381398575055?hash=item58cd2067cf:g:0~EAAOxyk99Rzh3l) instead of the kinda notches you show in that pic.

I had an experience like that at the beach, we rented these regular fixie beach cruisers and were just trying our best to power along on the wet sand, it was brutal. We got half a mile before giving up. So we just stay there, but over the next hour we see probably half a dozen fishermen biking along with six rods each, and tackleboxes, and buckets of fish, riding like it's nothing. Each time I had to point out to my relative, see that shiny thing in the rear hub, that's a motor, she thought we were just weaker than them!


My closest calls with cars have been split between both types. Like I will be going along at 20mph and a car pulls out right in front of me as they try to edge into traffic, seemingly unaware that I am traffic too. Then there are speeders that fly by while gunning it uphill and laying on the horn while passing cyclists, which I think I cut down on by going faster. Thankfully the bike lanes around where I live now are fairly wide, which is a plus.

What lockring wrench did you use? If what you have is easy to use then you just need to use it to tighten the hell out of that thing a lot more than what you did the first time.  But I'm guessing it wasn't easy to tighten since mine kept slipping. Man, park tool makes great stuff but the hcw-5 is not the right tool for this job, that's for sure. I am looking at tools that have better grip for my own build, here's some stuff I've dug up. I'm going to go ahead and add this to our bbs wiki page too for reference. 

Option one you look at wrench type tools that may have a better fit. [This one from California Ebike was specially built for the inner lockring.](http://california-ebike.com/product/bct-1/) (they also sell a pro tool with even better grip) [Adjustable lockring spanners like this one are recommended by some](http://www.niagaracycle.com/categories/xlc-adjustable-bottom-bracket-spanner). There are also tools built for small lockrings that should fit this better than the average lockring tool, for example [this one](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Universal-C-Spanner-Shock-Wrench-Small-38mm-52mm-/350267911163?ssPageName=ADME:L:OC:GB:3160) or [this one](http://www.amazon.com/Park-Tool-Fixed-Gear-Lockring-HCW-17/dp/B0049Z1BRI). There is a [wrench that fits the outer lockring here.](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_trksid=m570.l1313&amp;_nkw=BOTTOM+BRACKET+BB+INSTALL+TOOL+SHIMANO+HOLLOWTECH+II&amp;_sacat=0)

Option two is special sockets made by Bafang. These would go into a socket wrench or ideally a torque wrench. They are expensive but if you are having problems tightening and want to stop having to mess with it then it may be worth it.  [M33 inner lockring socket](http://www.lectriccycles.com/m33-inner-locknut-tool-for-e-rad-mid-drive/), and the [outer lockring socket](http://www.empoweredcycles.com/products/8fun-bbs02-bottom-bracket-tools). 

Here's some good advice I got from Cuntrover a while back which is probably a good idea too once you got everything back on 

&gt; Since the Bafang is it's own BB it may creak a bit in your frame, the crank arms may also make creaking noises. Lock up both brakes and load up one of the pedals to get the bike to flex under your weight. Keep tightening the inner lockring and crank arms depending on where the noise is coming from until it's creak free.",2016-02-11 11:40:27+00:00,czvwk6b,5.0,t1_czvsaoa,16453.0,ebikes

901,"Like everything is even. If you lay the plate against the BB there should not be any air gap between the plate and the bolt holes. Similarly if you lay it against the screw holes there should be no air gap between the plate and the BB. 

I'm probably not explaining it well, am I? Look at these characters: Ooo

Imagine each character as a point that needs to be even, at the same level with the others. The left character is the BB. This example is not flush. That's what my bbshd looked like when mounting the plate, the bolt holes were too low by about 1mm. So when I tightened the bolts the plate will be slightly pulled at an angle like this: /  pulled down too far towards the bolt holes and away from the BB.

Which means that not all the teeth on the back of the plate may be fully engaged by the BB. My motor fit really tight in the BB so I do not anticipate problems but if I do I will need to pull those bolts off and slip a washer with 1mm thickness into each of them.

I don't know about you but on mine the locknut is basically impossible to grip past a certain point so if I have problems keeping the motor in one place my only recourse would be messing with that plate and putting washers wherever they need to be so it's more flush.

* Kydex
* 3D printed plastic
* Fiberglass molds
* Aluminum sheet metal fastened with pop rivets

Kydex seems kinda neat since you just hit it with a heat gun and it'll shape into stuff but is stiff after it cools. 

3D printing is neat if you can make a nice model of what you want in it, but I guess it can be a bit tricky finding someone with a big enough printer to do the work. Probably a good option if you can figure all that out. 

Fiberglass molds look labor intensive but the finished product looks lovely. 

Aluminum seems dead simple but probably takes a lot of time to put all those rivets in and seal it, unless you get an expensive rivet tool that's pneumatic or something. 

Once I'm ready to work on battery box I'm going to start with Kydex since it seems cheap and forgiving. I'll probably have a battery bag inside the triangle and the kydex will just go over the whole triangle in a single sheet that's shaped to the frame. That way I can simply attach a small padlock to the bottom of it where the two sides join. Not exactly for knox but it's better than fabric I'm sure.

962,"Yeah pretty much.. I've got some reading material for you. First up is light reading going over some basics.. https://www.electricbike.com/regenerative-brakes/

The end of the page points to [a more in depth thread over at ES.](https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=7891) This goes over some technical data that backs these claims. Some is interesting, other parts not, but take note of this in particular:

&gt; One thing that is slightly counter-intuitive with regen is that applying more regen braking force does not necessarily increase the regen current going back into the battery pack. This is easy to understand when you realize that the maximum regen braking torque occurs when all the motor phases are simply shorted together. In this situation, the regen current simply circulates through the windings of the hub motor generating heat, and none of that energy ever flows back into the battery pack. At the other end, when the duty cycle (D) of the motor controller is such that the effective voltage going to the hub motor (Vbatt * D) exactly matches the back emf voltage of the motor, then there is also no current flowing into or out of the battery as well, though in this case there is no braking torque either.
&gt; 
&gt; Regen Amperage.gif
&gt;     Regen Amperage.gif (15.81 KiB) Viewed 13062 times
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In between these two points the current flowing into the battery follows a parabolic shape, with the maximum regen battery current occurring exactly in the middle. This is the point of maximum power transfer of energy back into the battery pack, and the hub is generating exactly half the braking torque that it would produce if all the windings were shorted. That's where you would want to be to get maximum amperage into the battery pack, but the efficiency of turning kinetic energy into useable battery energy is only 50% at this point.
&gt; 
&gt; In general, the less the regen braking current the higher the efficiency, since you have less I^2 R copper losses in the windings. However, if you are trying to slow to a stop, then applying a meager amount of regen torque won't increase the total amount of regen energy captured because even though the hub motor/controller may be converting a small amount of kinetic energy into battery energy with very high efficiency, you'll meanwhile be loosing much more energy to air drag and rolling friction while you come to a prolonged stop. Likewise, if you come to a very abrupt regen stop, you won't loose much of your kinetic energy to air and rolling friction, but the efficiency of converting that kinetic energy into battery energy via regen will be quite poor. Somewhere in between these two points is some optimum regen braking torque which would get a maximum amount of energy back into the pack.
&gt;

Here's some more real world data that may interest you. This rider did the Pike's Peak race on a hubmotor ebike and used regen on the way down. The climb for this race is something like 5000 feet, and he had a 1300 watthour battery pack. He says he got back 100 watthours on the descent, I guess that's only about 10%. Granted he wasn't trying to be slow and brake as much as possible but it's still a real world example.  https://www.electricbike.com/hub-motor-pikes-peak/

You seem to want to discuss healthcare, that's cool I guess.

&gt; low confidence

I know where you're coming from. There are many examples where they government services are lacking. There are just as many examples of scandals involving privatization. Which is not surprising since adding a corporate layer of bureaucracy results in even less accountability than the government. Anyway, you can see that universal healthcare works in the many examples of other countries that use it. It is not a risky proposition, we are pretty much the only first world country that does not handle healthcare this way. I do not believe this county is somehow lacking in its ability to follow in the footsteps of the many countries that have already designed these systems.

&gt; 2)

This ignores that economies of scale are always greater when the scale goes up. It also ignores that leaving the complex for-profit system in place and subsidizing it is a wasteful use of taxpayer money. The US wastes over half a trillion dollars annually due to this, and it is one of the main reasons why other industrialized nations on average pay half what we do for healthcare. Or since you seem to favor libertarian rhetoric:

&gt; *In many ways, libertarians can agree with liberals and the left on the conception of the good in a just society. Unlike many conservatives, who use a certain conception of “small government” as a Trojan horse for solidifying old hierarchies and the status of “preordained” elites, libertarians should aim their critique at the way centralized authority actually exacerbates inequality and injustice. And at the same time, we can argue for sensible social welfare programs like a Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI) and a simplified universal health insurance program. These simple, universal programs can satisfy the needs of society while doing away with huge bureaucracies and armies of compliance departments at big corporations (for more on how libertarians and the left can come together, check out these essays by Gary Chartier called Socialist Ends, Market Means).*

Yes there are some flaws and there always will be, but you have to ask yourself, should the primary goal of the healthcare system in this country be to make money off of sick people? Because that's essentially what you have with a privatized system. Privatization always sucks for this reason, because by definition it means the people are not getting the best deal. 

I don't know if you've seen the universal healthcare plan put forward by Bernie Sanders but it projects that the average family would on average save thousands of dollars per year. That's what you get with a plan done right.

The ones that are already on there even have an adjustable angle so you can move it closer to you really easily if that is the issue. (i love this feature on my ebike, it's awesome) The Jamis does not offer this as the stem is a single solid piece of metal. 

But if the battery fitting is still an issue you could put the saved money from this bike into affording luna's power density battery instead, and that pack will fit anywhere.

Google for custom welder in your area and they will take care of it. Consider something like pipe for the sideways piece since it will be less likely to flex. 

This would probably be impossible with anything other than a trike but should work out since you got more stability. Got some nice advantages too, since the downtube's easily removable you can swap it out to regular once burningman's over. And being side by side would make it a more social experience. On the downside you would have to use the throttle to get around since it will offset your access to the pedals.

979,"Yeah well I don't know about that, I mean the most popular electric transportation method in the world by far is the simple electric bicycle. It may not have the wow factor of an electric car but we got over a hundred million of them on the road because they are orders of magnitude more efficient, cheaper, lighter, and therefore vastly better for the environment.  I can do that same 40 miles with 1/500th of the amount of energy. 

This development was due in large part to the exponentially dropping cost of batteries brought about by interest in electric cars, indeed the Gigafactory alone is lowering global ebike battery pack costs by an additional 8% on top of the 10% per year reduction we are seeing. So there are positive knock-on effects throughout society. You would be missing one whole side of the equation to ignore those effects while focusing on the energy and resource costs for the entire supply chain and conclude that Tesla is bad for the environment. Indeed that is if you buy into those arguments about the supply chain at all, which is not necessarily accurate in all instances. 

Yes, resources are getting depleted. But there are figures for every major resource on the planet showing widespread depletion, not just the stuff that is used in electric cars. [I believe that humanity is headed for a resource crash regardless of whether or not we stopped developing cars, batteries, even cold fusion.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfAQktktGgQ&amp;list=PL7E8A774DA8435EEB&amp;index=20)  Fact is there are simply too many people on the planet for sustainability and the human race is likely doomed.

981,"Oh that's not a bad budget.

Yeah you could put regen on the front wheel. But it would mean getting basically a whole other kit as well, quite a price premium for what is at best a 20% efficiency gain. If you're looking to get some energy back in there you'd be better off getting a shade tolerant thin-film solar panel, tie into a solar controller, run to a cheap inverter and plug the battery pack into that. Probably an even better way if you're good with electrical stuff but I built a system like this for small electronics ten years ago and it worked nicely, only cost a few hundo and it was a dedicated system.  

Anyway let's say you go with a bbs02 and 48v 20ah system, [1](http://lunacycle.com/motors/mid-drive-kits/bafang-mid-drive-and-parts/bafang-bbs02-750w-mid-drive-with-upgraded-3077-controller/), [2](http://lunacycle.com/batteries/packs/48v-samsung-18650-20ah-ebike-battery/).

You could rock [the bbshd](http://lunacycle.com/motors/mid-drive-kits/bafang-mid-drive-and-parts/bafang-bbshd-1000w-mid-drive-kit-in-stock/) instead for 200 more which is actually built for this sort of heavy duty work, and that would probably be a very good idea, as well as $100 for the smallest chainring for more torque. So at that point you're at what, a few hundred over budget yes? Not too bad. For more power you'd want [this 52v pack](http://lunacycle.com/batteries/packs/52v-samsung-29e-18650-20-3ah/) for another extra hundred.

That battery doesn't have a high enough continuous discharge for the kit you're looking at. 48V would need 30amps continuous to produce 1500 watts. (Take the wattage of any kit and divide by its voltage to get the amps it needs.)

That pack has a continuous discharge of 20 amps, so you would need a kit that uses like, 48V 1000W at most. 

Third party seller sites like amazon are not recommended for kits, there's less quality control. Check the sidebar for a link to the wiki with links to recommended kits, batteries and so on. Keep the shipping location in mind when ordering as battery shipping can be very expensive. Sellers like Em3ev and Lunacycle have all-in-one kits+battery where the connectors are all matching so you don't have to add a connector, but if you do there's a link in the wiki on how to do that. 

Generally for hills you would want either a geared hub or a mid drive, that one on amazon is a direct drive (gearless) which has less hill climbing ability. 

Make sure you buy the battery from a somewhere reliable, lots of sketchy sellers cut corners there. You don't have to buy it from the Trusted list in the wiki, just make sure if you are buying from somewhere else that you know what you are doing, not blindly buying from the cheapest seller with no word-of-mouth recommendations.

That intimidates the hell out of me and is the main reason why I have not planned on going with a bbshd for my build. Even after that part is finishes, when reading the install manual I feel like its written with special terminology that only experienced mechanics would recognize. 

What I would need is an ELI5. What would you say to a person with zero bike mechanic experience and no special tools to make it easiest? Can you take the bike to an LBS and just say, I dunno, take everything out of my bottom bracket shell? Is that even the right terminology? 

Past that point I think you still need some special tools like a lockring wrench thing, loctite, calipers, yes? The manual says specific Nm of tightening force for certain parts, how do you know how much that is, use a special torque wrench for hex bolts? How do you know which is the left and right cranks, and is that the right side when looking at the front or rear? Is the m33 but the same as a lockring?  How do you get the bb cup over the m33 and what keeps it there and  what's the black thing in the pic next to the cup and how does it fit in there? Do you still need to access the controller to disable PAS in the BBSHD, or did they fix PAS in this model so singletrack isn't dangerous?

Finally, where exactly is the install manual for the bbshd, because all I see is one for the bbs02. Does it exist?

1046,"Neither, bikes with rear mounted batteries handle like shit and look awful. Those designs may have been acceptable years ago but there is so much better choices in factory built ebikes these days, some at half the price. 

But if I had to pick I would go with the pedego, and the 15 ah battery upgrade, due to decent 500W motor and good capacity 48V battery.

That new izip has mid drive motor on it, right? I know mid drives are the new hotness right now but the low wattage would be a deal breaker for me, I mean, when I ride my ebike I often got somewhere to be, and as transportation I need something that's got a decent top speed, regardless of taking an efficiency loss by going with a hub motor. 

But that's just me, on my relatively flat terrain. It might be perfect for you depending on what you want it for, like leisure rides on hilly bike paths. Have you asked the shop to test drive them? Have you looked them up on electricbikereview? I dont think they have the 2016 izip on there yet but it might still give you an idea of the build quality.

For comparison for the same price you could buy a 2016 Haibike sduro with a Yamaha mid drive, an arguably better bike, in the very least due to the center mounted battery, as well as looking like a bike that's actually worth thousands of dollars. Anyway, for several hundred less you could get a 600W 14ah prodeco phantom xr, which is about the same performance specs as the city commuter. For like a thousand dollars less you could get a voltbike interceptor with a nice 1000W mxus motor, which uses thin laminations for about a 10% efficiency boost meaning more range and torque (I wish more motor companies did this because it sounds great).

* http://www.electricbikeattack.com/customer-service/  
* http://www.electriccyclery.com/

Definitely ask la ebike, he's a good guy and he's just getting his shop off the ground so I'm guessing he could use the business even if he'd rather you buy an ebike from him. Actually a lot of these shops are like that, where it's either they want to sell you a factory built ebike (which is crazy expensive for a high powered, high capacity mid drive) or it's just a regular shop that might not know wtf you're even talking about. 

You could also ask if anyone could do the conversion for you at endless-sphere.com, they're the largest ebike forum and many members are in that area. 
https://endless-sphere.com/forums/index.php

there's also this list, but i'm sure it is outdated and lots of them may be unhelpful:

another option, if you just call a few regular bike shops in your area and ask them the odds of them agreeing to work on it are not terrible, in my experience here in washington dc it's about 30% of the shops I call, assuming I can talk to the mechanic and explain roughly what I need. In your case you probably don't need much more than having them remove the crank arm and replace the bottom bracket with the motor, and tightening it back up. Besides that it's just connecting a few wires, stuff you can easily do yourself.

Yeah they got that new bbshd, possibly overkill for what you need but then again I don't know if you're doing that whole 1000ft climb at once or if it's a more gradual climb. BBSHD dissipates heat better for sure, and the bigger motor will work better. On the other hand it is so much power you might end up snapping the chain or wearing out the drivetrain much faster.

* [750W BBS02](http://lunacycle.com/motors/mid-drive-kits/bafang-mid-drive-and-parts/bafang-bbs02-750w-mid-drive-with-upgraded-3077-controller/) 
* charger option $35
* lunacycle battery bag option $30

total $1165. The bbs02 will fit on most regular bikes and the battery goes in the bag, make sure the bike triangle can fit a battery bag in there. You'll top out around 28MPH and have a range of more than 40 miles, probably much more if you feel like pedaling along. 

If the bike has a big triangle you could get away with one of the larger, cheaper batteries luna sells that are the same capacity. You can get the bike from anywhere, bikesdirect is a good online seller if you want new, craigslist is very good especially this time of the year for used deals. If you are unsure about a frame or whether the ""bottom bracket"" (the part where you pedal) can accommodate this then just post a question about the bike and you'll get a good answer, lot of smart guys on here ",2016-01-14 22:16:17+00:00,cyygl3z,5.0,t1_cyyexjg,2302.0,ebikes
1056,"You're doubling the number of motors and batteries to make up for the efficiency loss you would have if you went with a mid drive. On a mid drive when you hit that bigass hill and need to climb a thousand feet you can shift into the lowest gear and the motor will climb it like it's nothing, but a hub motor will slow down. Motors are not efficient when they are spinning slowly like if they are bogging down. Get what I mean? So on your current bike it's going to bog down and lose efficiency, meaning you need more capacity because the hill's just going to kill the battery like that. On the other hand a mid drive spinning a bike in the lowest gear is spinning really fast, so it's going to be much, much more efficient. Each 20ah battery runs you like $750 and another motor's not cheap either, so you end up saving like a thousand bucks",2016-01-14 20:27:59+00:00,cyybu54,3.0,t1_cyyavh4,1306.0,ebikes
1057,"Quite a round trip and elevation change. 

The best answer is to sell it and build one from scratch. Cheap mountain bike with BBS02 mid drive and 20ah 48V li-ion battery = maybe $1200. 

If you must use this bike though, you would need two 20ah 48V lithium batteries and another motor for the front wheel.  First battery replaces the lead acid pack, front wheel replaced with a cast hub motor in wheel that's the same size, second 20ah battery is hooked up to the front so you've got a sort of all wheel drive thing going on. I forget exactly how that whole thing works like if you can run both motors off the same controller or you need separate ones but either way you would probably buy a controller, either to replace the one that's in there or so the original controller and wiring is mostly left untouched. Probably would run you about $2000, and would not still not be awesome on hills like a mid drive, though the range and speed would be much improved.

ALL those traits in one person? sure thing, since there are so many why don't you list a bunch of them. shit man, i bet you would be hard pressed to even list a couple of them but here we got op claiming two were working at the same airport together. unlikely. 

OP said they asked him to consent to chloroform. He didn't have to describe it actually being used on him, because here's the thing, nobody would use it on him. There are plenty of drugs easier to get that are far more effective for whatever evil deeds he thinks they did to him. It does have name recognition though, and is talked about in movies. it is what someone would say if they were making shit up and knew nothing about drugs used to incapacitate someone. You would have to inhale it for five minutes before you would pass out. If you go by OP's story and these guys are hardened criminals don't you think they would be a lot more effective than that. 

Furthermore yes consent forms exist. But not consent forms for your boss to use chloroform on you while you work. *maybe* if you were getting surgery at a dentist and even then it is unlikely. I can't believe I have to explain the difference to you. oh and it's a government job, so any forms are drafted by a chain of federal lawyers and kept on file within an HR department, they wouldn't be able to just pop on down to the first shady lawyer they find and have something written up and have it actually be usable

oh and what a bonus, these are the same guys he saw rape and murder some chick. If you just murdered someone and were trying to rape the witness would you ask them permission before drugging them and get them to sign consent forms?

1139,"I would love if you could comment on this excerpt from ""A practical guide to wheelbuilding"" , 3rd edition, by Roger Musson. He seems to be saying that double butted results in a more robust wheel.

&gt; The plain gauge spoke may look and feel stronger than a double butted spoke but if either are
going to break then it will be at the spoke elbow or the spoke threads where both spokes are
identical in diameter. Yet I still see adverts for handbuilt wheels that say“built with plain gauge
spokes for strength”. All the wheels for the Pro downhill riders that I built used 32 double butted
spokes.

&gt; A double butted spoke has a central portion of a reduced diameter. The central portion is not cut
or shaved but made via a forging process where the spoke goes through a pair of rollers that
squeeze the metal (I believe DT use a different method of forging the central portion). **The
thinner central portion of the butted spoke will stretch slightly when building and the cyclic
changes in tension on the spoke as you ride the bike will be absorbed within this region rather
than generating high cyclic loads on the spoke elbow and threads giving rise to fatigue issues**
(fatigue is where high cyclic concentrated loads cause the metal to slowly crack). The inbuilt
“stretch” will also ensure that the spoke does not become totally unloaded allowing the nipple to
unscrew and the spoke to loosen.

Yeah his tech was licensed to Industrial Heat, and funded by a couple billion dollar investment firms.

The plant produces 1 MW heat energy, about the equivalent of burning 29 gallons of gasoline per hour, every hour. In order for the test to be considered successful by IH it must produce this heat constantly, 24/7, 7 days a week, with a minimum uptime of 365 out of 400 days. The plant just finished the 300 day milestone of constant operation, so we are in the home stretch. 

So it's kind of a wait right now. Some things are happening in the meantime.

 apparently others are different like that hutchinson tire mentioned earlier in this thread which has a semiregular tire over top of it or the one you mentioned where something else goes on top.

Most people say the only way to actually get one of these off the rim is to cut the pins and buy new ones to replace them with when putting back on. Probably does make it harder to service if you got a broken spoke and just need to remove the tire real quick. 

I don't see why the tire would have to get much taller just because it's wider, seems like they would have more control over how it is shaped with this material and as long as you're not scraping the rim when you turn what's the harm? 

&gt; No solid tire can replicate this pneumatic cushion.

I think it is kind of a misnomer that reviewers keep calling it a solid tire when it is actually a closed cell nanofoam. I don't know if air in a foam acts in the same way as a column of air in a single chamber, but it's probably close. A similar material has been used for some time in sneakers where they take the impact of a footsteps so we can safely assume they do a pretty good job. And there is probably more air in this tire by weight than the usual tire/rim/tube. I mean, it would have to be wouldn't it, since this tire is lighter.

1164,"We all have that to some extent, you are not alone. It is often described as a sort of analytical, situational ""running commentary"" that explores other potential realities. This could have usefulness as a survival mechanism: a prehistoric human might be thinking it appears safe to go outside but *maybe* he should worry about some remote possibility his running commentary has cooked up like a tiger hiding behind a nearby tree. Probably not the case but sometimes it was so his genes were more likely to be passed on.

For some people it is louder than others, while some may not even notice it. Still others have problems differentiating between this commentary and what they know to be true, where it is intrusive. This is the basis for diagnosis of psychotic mental disorders like schizophrenia. If you find it is getting louder you may be at risk for late-onset schizophrenia, if it becomes a real issue see a psychiatrist.

Just like there is no cure for schizophrenia there is no way to turn off running commentary, probably not even with antipsychotic drugs. You must accept it as simply another distraction to be ignored. 

Feeding into it is probably not super healthy and there's certainly other things you may want to avoid as well. In particular, cannabis has a tendency to sort of turn up the volume on this kind of thing, so don't smoke pot, or if you must at least switch to high CBD / low THC ""medical"" types, since CBD is antipsychotic. Several people predisposed to it have found ingestion of high potency THC or its analogs to be a sort of trigger that ended up kicking off a lifelong struggle with differentiating between real and imagined (""psychosis""), particularly when experimenting with the legal research chemical THC analogs since these contain none of the CBD that somewhat balances it out. Other drugs to limit or avoid are PCP and to a lesser extent psychedelics. ",2015-12-21 09:01:21+00:00,cy6fe4u,1.0,t3_3xoey0,4867.0,Meditation

Not really comparable when the Orbo is two orders of magnitude more expensive than what somebody is probably going to spend on a game microtransaction. You also know the game will deliver the product, it's not a gamble. Big difference there. Why would a person want to be an early adopter of a very overpriced charger and take such a gamble when they could wait a couple months and get a clearer idea if they're going to get ripped off? 

Anyway, this isn't the first energy device to hit the market where people had their doubts. Each time the number of buyers has been low despite whatever hype, so I'm not just guessing. Then they usually fail to deliver to those first few, people state as such on public forums, and people stop buying from the scammer. For example take ""keshe foundation"", probably one of the most blatant of free energy scammers that has products for sale. If you want a laugh at some of their fake made up science, [here's the manual for their hoax energy generator](http://blueprint.keshefoundation.org/manual.php). See how much bullshit you can detect on that page, it's quite fun. 

&gt; Bringing a $10 box that you can sell for $1200 makes a lot of sense to a scammer. 

Maybe. If your projected sales before people catch on is lower than projected operating costs needed to get to market then it would make more sense to take off as soon as you got funding. Probably also depends how long you think you could go on deceiving investors. If they have given you tens of millions I can't imagine you would want to stick around for years.

[Here's some background on the plant test's terms](http://fcnp.com/2015/05/06/the-peak-oil-crisis-the-cold-fusion-conference/).

&gt; Two or three journalists who attended the conference however, reported being told by a “credible” source, possibly Darden, that the 400-day, 24/7, acceptance test of the one megawatt reactor is going well after several months.

To me that sounds like they are setting up a team to try a replication while Rossi is not there, independently or with as little input from him as possible.

Personally that's what I want to see, because it's the next logical step. The gold standard of science has always been replication and that's as true of LENR as it is of EMdrive or anything else. As far as the man behind the invention, we could go back and forth all day on how much to trust the guy but it doesn't look like we would accomplish much.

So this is apparently the new normal for LENR patents. Avoid grandiose assumptions about the origin of the heat and you can get it approved. If you criticize Rossi for this strategy you must do the same for everyone else, you sure you want to call into question the legitimacy of a military scientist and the other professionals that are likely to follow?

If you really want to go down the rabbit hole you can read some of the patent controversy regarding this scientist and another of the world's leading LENR researchers from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.

From the rest of the article it sounds like the chief concern was how quickly they can lose capacity. If that is the case the batteries may not even be ""faulty"".

 I could drain a brand new pack to 0% and let sit for months before recharging, its gonna lose significant capacity, right? Doesn't mean the pack's faulty though, and anyone who thought that after abusing a pack would simply be ignorant of how to treat them.

1278,"Road bike's fine but get a suspension seatpost cause it'll get bumpy. 

Also note the angle of your forks. A front hub wants to pull the front wheel forward which stresses the forks, at that angle lots of stress goes on a small anount of metal in the dropouts which may lead to catastrophic failure, def use torque arms if on the front. 

Those kits are generally fine for the money, nothing fancy just generic, same stuff you could get from ebay, aliexpress or yescomusa for the same price. Don't expect any support though, amazon's a third party seller site and sellers generally do not stand behind their product as much as a dedicated vendor on their own site. 

Honestly the kit itself is nowhere near as important as the battery, which is not included in any $300 kit. That's the thing you really need to watch out for as far as quality, price, support etc.

1283,"It can be true but depends on the build quality. Hubmotors themselves are practically indestructible but there's a few sensors in the hub that do sometimes fail. The sensors help manipulate the magnetic field. Often when they fail an EV will fall back to a sensorless mode or a backup sensor set in the hub. The sensors only cost a few bucks to replace but its still a repair job so its probs better to add backups built in or beef them up somehow.

It's really rare that the actual motor would break though as long as you're not overvolting it with insane amounts of power. And even then they're usually fine as long as you introduce some cooling like drilling air holes. 

On the E-bike scene a really cool development is putting magnetic ferrofluid into the casing of the hubmotor, which wicks heat off to the sides much better than previous methods, without having to expose the internals to the elements or put a bunch of leaky oil in there.

1308,"Suppose I could chime in since you paged me.. thing about fatbikes is all the extra air in the fat tires provides a huge amount of comfy cushioning, which is gonna be essential. This would be the ride of choice for bigger guys if it weren't for the fact that bigger tires mean it takes more effort to pedal, fortunately that's not a problem if the bike is electric ;-) plus if the ride's still uncomfortable you can basically let some air out of the tires and it will ride even better with no problems, which is impossible with a regular bike without getting flats.

On top of that you have a front suspension fork with this model, which is unheard of for fatbikes and this will also help with handling extra weight, evening out bumps. You miss out on that kinda thing compared to, say, a Sondors fatbike at half the price. 

For a general idea of how well fatbikes handle extra weight [check this post from electric-fatbike.com](http://electric-fatbike.com/2015/02/11/the-thud-buster-because-your-ass-deserves-it-for-everything-you-do/). He weighs 205 pounds and abuses the hell out of his fatbikes and they're fine, another 40 pounds won't make a difference. I also agree with the content of that post about the suspension seatpost which can make a huge difference, though the star of the show for any bigger guy is gonna be the seat itself. [I've bought this seat twice now](http://www.amazon.com/Cloud-9-Cruiser-Saddle-Tri-Color-Lycra/dp/B0006JHU2Q), for both my regular ebike and my current project bike. It's fantastic. Super wide so it supports your butt instead of your buttcheeks hanging over the sides. It also has springs which will help absorb shock. Both times I take an XLR seatpost, remove the mount clamp the cloud9 comes with, bend the rails on the C9 slightly inward then tighten the clamp on the post way down until it fits snugly. Do it right and the whole arrangement gives you three sets of springs for shock absorbtion and damping, on top of big tires it'll ride like a dream for any big guy.

1367,"Man, lotta questions.

Yeah you should probably link to the bike and the kit. But I can tell you right now the motor is probably not from a known seller and it's probably not the right one for you. You do not need more than a 2000 watt motor because it sounds like you are wanting to just buy a battery pack, and nobody sells a pack higher than 72V. [This pack](http://www.electricrider.com/Super-Light-Lithium-Manganese-72V-20AH-Battery-p/lim7220-22.htm) is the highest voltage you can find, yeah it'll pop wheelies for sure but let's say you're going 72v at 30 amps that's what, 2000 watts right? So you don't need a motor rated for double that. 

And odds are the motor isn't rated for higher than that anyway, it's just some shady seller who lists the motor as super high so it'll sell better. A nice crystalyte kit will start at around $1000 and that would probably burn out if you put more than 2000 watts in it. And MXUS 3000 will take 3000 watts and the only US based kit I seen costs 1700. 

Also, if you don't know what you're doing then save yourself the hassle of dealing with mismatched wires and just get the kit instead of buying things separately. The cost savings isn't that much anyway. 

I have the same problem as you figuring out a good mounting place. Anywhere other than the center has serious drawbacks, especially for offroad. It can be scary to feel the rear slide out from behind you while you're braking into a turn on a narrow bike trail, and this is the norm if it's rear mounted. If you have room in the triangle the standard is to use a battery bag but I've never much liked the idea of all that, no real theft prevention if you lock your bike up somewhere. I have been toying with the idea of using thin aluminum sheet metal, bending it into some shape while heating with a little torch, then using a pop rivet gun to attach the pieces together into a box that fits the triangle.

In total there's about 160 patents filed between the licensee and Rossi. Here's an interesting excerpt from the aforementioned application:

&gt; [0070] In this configuration, the reaction chamber 12 is configured to receive and contain an energy-producing reactive material, referred to herein as a ""fuel"" or ""charge"", therein. When electric power is driven through the resistance wires 16, heat and/or electromagnetic radiation is provided to the reaction chamber 12 to thereby drive the reaction of the reactive material in the chamber 12. A reaction may be controlled by varying the current, voltage, and/or waveform of the electrical signal driven through the resistance wires 16. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the reactive material in the chamber 12 produces products and energy from a chemical and/or a nuclear reaction, such as thermal energy and/or electromagnetic radiation, in response to the energy input from the electrical power provided through the resistance wires 16. The energy input from the resistance wires 16 may include heat (e.g. conducted, inducted, and/or radiated) and/or electromagnetic radiation. 

Apparently in US patent law when you want to patent something complex you start with the vaguest patent that gets accepted so it has broad applicability for protecting your IP, then you file further patents on top of that for specific use cases while referring back to the 'master patent' for background. In this instance the patent in the article is the US master patent.",2015-10-26 02:17:51+00:00,cwcxhug,7.0,t1_cwab5du,201744.0,ecat

Ford is also moving in this direction by using Alcoa MicroMill technology in new F-150 trucks, in order to reduce weight so they can meet higher fuel efficiency standards.

When many of those articles were written you basically had to grow this stuff in a test tube under laboratory conditions.  

I have a book somewhere around here from Algaelab with a much more positive outlook, written by a NASA scientist who actually has real world knowledge of the costs involved. I will try to dig it out and post you some more realistic numbers. 

Just from a practical standpoint you would think that operational costs would be cheaper, not having to maintain animal pasture or deal with pests and disease, just a sunny room which needs little upkeep. And even if you were only comparing heavily subsidized animal feedstock against the spirulina feedstock these expenses would vary wildly depending on bulk purchase and supplier, so making a blanket characterization that costs differ X amount is absurd without a lot of data to back it up.

1523,"Alright that seems reasonable. Let me let you in on a little secret that I think you will find a little more useful if you already have an mg scale. While they may not be all that accurate at 1mg they will be good at 50mg. You can take advantage of this to easily lay the doses on Altoid mints. 

Weigh out 50 MG and pour into a shotglass, use a 1ml oral syringe to add exactly 1 ml of 91% ISO rubbing alcohol to this shotglass and stir with a paperclip while the shotglass is warming under a hotplate or electric stove (on lowest setting of course) It will dissolve completely in a matter of seconds once it gets slightly warm. 

Now suck the liquid back up into the syringe. There are 25 drops in a 1ML syringe, which equals 2 mg etizolam per drop if you added 50 MG to the shotglass. You use the syringe and put one drop each on an Altoids mint, the ISO evaps completely in about ten minutes because it is very pure. Each mint is now dosed with 2mg and can be easily taken with you wherever without needing to measure out anything. 

Good idea to evap a bit of the ISO in a dish and do a residue taste test to see if the manufacturer adds a bitterant to the rubbing alcohol before using it but this is generally not necessary if you just use like the clear CVS or Target brand which I assure you are pure. The mints look and taste like mints afterwards, so if you do this be sure to label the tin afterwards, it's not something you want to forget is dosed.

But in the long run I bet you save money with a full suspension bike. I have gone through a couple rear rims on my bike and it's because there's no suspension on the back, and sometimes that rear rim with the heavy motor slams into a curb or ditch. The rim takes the full weight instead of getting absorbed by a shock, next thing you know you need to get the rim replaced by your local bike shop. The total for one of these repairs is more than the cost of that cheap walmart bike, after you factor in cost of labor and special ordering a tough double-walled replacement ebike rim.    

And that's if the bike shop will even agree to work on your e-bike, I have discovered many bike shops refuse to work on it if they see any motor.

Further uses of the term do not refer to a specific theory, just the basic theme that the world would be a better place if the rich had more money. It is often dressed up differently to make it look less blatantly selfish, since the politicians that support it are often funded by those that would personally gain. 

Variations on the idea are used as justification for tax cuts for the rich. Effectively this means enriching the wealthy at the expense of everyone else, sort of a reverse Robin Hood scenario. 

The International Monetary Fund says that trickle down is bad for an economy, which is what you would expect.

The real deal you should keep in mind is that landlords are required by law to give something like 24 hours (or more) notice before entering your home. Doesn't matter if its repairs, inspections, whatever. If they enter without notice like they just roll up into your apartment to look around? You can sue, get them fined by the state, all sorts of great stuff. They just don't do that ever, so you would have plenty of time to move your pet to a petsitter for a couple days if you're nervous about it. 

For more info about the minimum notice your particular state requires google ""landlord tenant act {your state's name}"". Landlords get REALLY nervous if you mention you are well versed in this law, I have used it to instantly break leases with no penalty, its awesome how much it can empower you. Try rolling up to the management office and telling them 'the unfixed cockroach situation in my apartment materially affects my safety and is thus in violation of the landlord tenant act, you are now liable for all private contractors I hire and any court costs'. I've watched a slumlord turn ghost white when he heard that, after figuring out I actually knew what I was talking about. One of the most satisfying experiences of my life right there.

Because you're basically saying owning something that can be used for violence causes you to do a violent act, with no underlying reason beyond that. And it does not take much critical thinking to see the flaws in that, does it? 

After all you own kitchen knives, hammers, probably all sorts of things that can be used to harm others, yet you probably do not use them for such purpose. Likewise the vast majority of gun owners have never shot a person, so owning a gun is not the root cause of wanting to shoot people. 

This is the same sort of flawed thinking that started drug and alcohol prohibition, the notion that society cannot be trusted with dangerous things due to some small minority making them look bad. No consideration that this minority is simply sick in the head, or lashing out from marginalization, or some desperate circumstance. Those are the ones you have to watch out for, and banning stuff does not make them safer, because there is always something else to abuse, or way to hurt people, or whatever the concern is. Only way to do that is to deal with those people and why they want to do what they do.

Right now it is impractical to get the thousands of phytonutrients present in plant-based meal replacements into something like soylent using synthetic sources, meaning you have no choice if you want the widest possible range of micronutrients in your diet. 

It's not like you can just call up the local chemical supply warehouse and say you would like to order all of the 25,000 phytonutrients discovered in plant based foods in a stable bioavailable form. If it were that easy soylent would have already added them.

Many of these nutrients are prone to oxidative degradation, oxidation that is usually prevented because they are located inside of a plant's cell walls. So for each chemical a synthetic form requires 

* a synthesis route, many will likely be a custom synth where no current route is known (greatly adding cost)
* gc/ms and nmr spectroscopic analysis to test for purity
* stabilizing after synthesizing each compound
*  stabilizing may possibly impact bioavailability so testing should be done for that
* testing to find out whether all these stabilized chemicals interact in unknown ways compared to the types that are plant based

This would need to be done for *thousands of compounds*. See the problem?

Maybe in the future we'll all eat foods spit out on demand from molecular 3d printers that can assemble the same compounds present in plants for instant ingestion long before they degrade or whatever. But that's not today.

Although I might add that fuel analysis showing transmutation and isotope shifts is a clear indicator that it is a nuclear reaction. If it is true that all transmutation is caused by either decay or nuclear reaction then there is no other explanation. Years ago Toyota published their transmutation findings in the Japanese Journal of Applied Physics as did Mitsubishi when they replicated the experiment, yet here we are still discussing why LENR is not taken seriously. 

As to quality replications, there are probably few emerging fields where all replications are successful. That said, I agree replication attempts could be better. But again stigma gets in the way. [In this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkmzCkEFt94) a professor at MIT explains how he secured funding from a major corporation to do a replication of the work of professor Francesco Piantelli, who pioneered nickel-hydrogen exothermic reactors. With that sort of good news we should have seen the quality reproducibility you desire, right? Instead a colleague at MIT was apparently so hostile to this research that he cancelled the program, then went on to call the VP of the company doing the funding and badmouthed the research to such an extent that the funding was cancelled and people within the company who supported it felt their employment was at risk. How do you expect quality replications to proceed in such an environment? 

Still, there have been many good replications. NASA's GRC [was able to reproduce Pons and Fleishmann's anomalous heat compared to controls even back in 1989,](http://i.imgur.com/fCPkF9b.png) the same year they made their announcement. Although much of the current research has been shifted to the Navy and Darpa they continue to keep the public up to date with various articles and even videos by senior NASA scientists, [like this one.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtHR1NCzeKU)

1679,"The leading theory (and the one endorsed by NASA) accounts for this. It is *Ultra Low Momentum Neutron Catalyzed Nuclear Reactions* by Widom and Larsen, in European Physical Journal C. It was in the list I linked you. Here's the relevant section from a short conceptual overview.


Question 1 - If LENRs are truly based on the process of fusing two positively charged deuterons, then how is the Coulomb repulsion barrier overcome at the moderate temperatures and pressures that prevail in LENR laboratory experiments? It is well known that stars such as our sun require temperatures of millions of degrees and enormous pressures to trigger nuclear fusion.

Widom and Larsen answer -

&gt; LENRs do not involve strong interaction fusion of charged deuterons or protons. Rather, LENRs involve the weak capture of surface electrons (bathed in a soft electromagnetic radiation field) by collectively oscillating ""patches"" of protons or deuterons located on metallic hydride surfaces. Under such conditions, protons or deuterons in the ""patches"" can react directly with surface electrons, thereby producing ""ultracold"" ultra low momentum neutrons which then function as uncharged ""nuclear catalysts."" Such neutrons are always locally absorbed by nearby nuclei, triggering additional ""weak"" nuclear transmutation reactions (which create different chemical elements) and the release of heat. Importantly, there are no Coulomb barriers to such weak interactions; so extremely high temperatures and pressures are not required, as is the case with strong interaction fusion processes. The neutrinos that are always produced when neutrons are created simply radiate off into space; they don't really interact locally with anything on Earth.

Question 2 - Why aren't large quantities of high momentum (energetic) neutrons produced in LENR systems, as would be expected from typical nuclear fusion or fission processes?

Widom and Larsen answer -

&gt; As stated above, weak interaction nuclear reactions are not Coulomb barrier penetrating as would be the case with strong interaction nuclear fusion. Furthermore, the initial weak nuclear interactions produce only ultra low momentum neutrons that are locally absorbed by nearby nuclei. Accordingly, we would not expect biologically significant quantities of energetic neutrons to be externally detected in LENR systems, which is exactly what has been observed in thousands of experiments.

Naturwissenschaften (The Science of Nature ) is described by the publisher Springer as their flagship multidisciplinary science journal. 

&gt; Naturwissenschaften is only interested in publishing the very best of research, and the selection criteria are scientific excellence, novelty, and the potential to attract the widest possible readership, reflecting the multidisciplinary nature of the journal. 

As to the rest there are dozens of papers so I will [simply link to this list](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Cold_fusion/Recent_sources) rather than pasting them all here. One not on that list is 
*Three Types of dd Fusion, Trans. Amer. Nucl. Soc., 2005, 93: p. 895.* You might enjoy reading it so I will paste a bit below (minus the equations)

&gt; There seem to be 3 different processes by which deuterons can be made to fuse so as to release nuclear energy.  The
conventional approach is thermonuclear fusion, which uses collisions between energized deuterons to create a transient 4He nucleus that decays by energetic particle emission.  Deuteron-deuteron (dd) fusion is modeled by scattering theory.   Quantum wave mechanics uses wave functions to describe the colliding particles as plane waves. The waves are treated as if arriving from infinity, and as going away to infinity after scattering or reaction. Gamow
factors calculating the probability of transmission through the dd Coulomb barrier are used in calculating fusion rates.

&gt; The other 2 dd fusion processes are catalytic processes.  Catalysis substitutes configuration change for kinetic
impact in promoting reaction.  Catalytic processes usually use surface and interface science to reduce the temperature
at which exothermic reactions can take place.

&gt; The one catalytic process that is generally accepted as leading to dd fusion is based on creating
an anomalously high deuteron density.  This high density is achieved in a D2+ molecule by replacing the ion's electron by a negative
muon.  The process is called muon-catalyzed fusion.  The mass of the muon is 200 times the mass of the electron and
creates a 200 times smaller molecule.  The effective density is increased by a factor ~10^7.  At this density, quantum mechanics tunneling through the Coulomb barrier separating the 2 deuterons leads to a significant wave function overlap and fusion reaction rate.  The nuclear products are the normal products of thermal plasma fusion.   The process is not practical in a commercial heat source because of the short lifetime of the negative muon against decay.

&gt; The other catalytic method uses the reverse strategy. It works at normal density and uses a catalyzed configuration
change to reduce dd Coulomb repulsion in a metal deuteride.  The configuration change is called coherent partitioning, and the wave function describing the altered configuration is called a Bloch function.  When the Bloch function configuration applies to deuterons hosted in a metal crystal, energy-minimizing quantum mechanics replaces a 2-body wave function with Coulomb barrier by a 2-body wave function with anti-correlation.  The anti-correlation
factor reduces, but does not prevent wave function overlap and the associated possibility of fusion.  The change in
wave function configuration occurs when partitioning exceeds a critical value, namely, the point at which the quantum mechanics kinetic
energy density associated with the dd repulsion singularity becomes greater than the potential energy density.

&gt; When the anti-correlation wave function configuration applies, wave function overlap occurs and coordinate
exchange symmetry becomes established.  The strong force nuclear interaction is then no longer blocked, and
deuteron pairs can fuse to produce a helium nucleus of the same Bloch array configuration. ",2015-08-13 04:40:51+00:00,cu19g3f,7.0,t1_cu17c5i,4495.0,Futurology

You do not want hostile third parties to know what software and version numbers you are on. Not only from a privacy standpoint, but security as well. If you were a spook and could have an actively maintained list of every Linux server vulnerable to bugs like Heartbleed by passively monitoring their software channel metadata, don't you think that would be useful?

There may be MitM concerns as well since the hash lists are currently sent plaintext, rendering them as vulnerable to alteration as the packages themselves. This is scenario is less likely but not impossible. 

This is all easily prevented by using HTTPS on the server your distro uses for package management. A comparatively easy fix that requires little to no coding, and provides peace of mind against several obvious attack vectors. And that's really my point, when it is so easily implemented the question should not be ""why"", it should be ""why not?"".

For example Linux is the only OS that does not use encrypted software channels. The fix is easy since package managers already have secure capabilities, but no distros bother using it. I brought this up months ago yet there has been no change in the 200+ distros.

My last experience with it was 20 years ago, long before I got into Buddhism. It's an introspective trip although its dissociative properties quiet the mind more like K or MXE, which promotes a mental sense of space unusual for a trip, so it doesn't feel quite so much like a rollercoaster, nor is it as exhausting. There are visuals, in particular I remember a rather unique color shift it promoted, never seen in any other substance, very like having a solid colored lens filter placed over the entire visual field that changes color of everything at the same rate. The effect is in stark contrast to the usual multifaceted visuals you get from any other psychedelic, while still being very noticeable. I found it subtly accents the mental trip rather than distracting from it. Altogether I can totally see how it would be a useful substance to take if you were an ascetic looking to have a mystical experience while meditating, moreso than shrooms anyway.

1806,"Yeah, I have had it. It is a unique trip with its own distinct qualities. Terence may be right about regular shrooms giving better visuals, I admit that. But the Rig Veda praises Soma for its ability to induce a spiritual awakening, and the most suitable substance for that is not necessarily the one with the best visuals. It also depends on the level of dissociation provided by the substance in question, duration, body load and potency. Due to all that, fly agaric may have been a more suitable divine sacrament than a shroom. 

I don't know how much interest there is in the classic trips these days what with so many interesting RCs out there but I think it is a worthwhile substance if you wanted to try it and see for yourself. I mean, have you ever tried meditating on psilocybin mushrooms, you know how your mind is kind of all over the place and the body may have too much energy..

1807,"The old preparations can be as strong as any shroom trip, remember we are talking about a processed mushroom product and not an actual mushroom. If Terence did not know about how to produce a relatively pure product he would probably not take enough to know fly agaric's true properties, as it can be very intense.  For instance you can decarboxylate its (toxic) ibotenic acid into muscarinic acid with heat, in order to safely take a breakthrough dose. Additionally the extraction process itself using milk would cut down on the body load. 

On top of all that we have evidence from remote tribes that one of the main ways most people used fly agaric was collected from human urine, since it passes through metabolism unchanged but with none of the toxic ingredients found in the original mushroom...or as the rig veda states, 'pressed out by the pressers in a tawny colored stream, an exhilirating stream', to then be a golden hued liquid resting in wooden saucers. There are remote villages in russia IIRC that document a similar ritual, where the rich townfolk would enjoy the fly agaric preparations and then open their door to pee outside, where the poorer villagers would await with vessels to catch the liquid and in this way also get to trip. 

I agree with Terence that psilocybin shrooms have a big place in many of the world's early religious texts, just not in this case.",2015-07-08 18:42:05+00:00,cswhbu1,3.0,t1_cswaiza,9916.0,Buddhism
1808,"It is more likely to be the mushroom known as fly agaric, Amanita Muscaria. Several books have been written by mycologists supporting this theory and having read them I find it to be a solid argument. 

Consider that soma often had trippy descriptions where it was unpredictable, these are not the reliable sedative effects of opium. It matches well the description of Fly agaric though, which contains a couple hallucinogenic substances. It is also unpredictable compared to ordinary psychedelics. It is capable of causing one to ""merge with the godhead"", as it was described, (in other words cause ego dissolution similar to a temporary glimpse of enlightenment) but it was also capable of causing a temporary but extreme sickness if not prepared properly. (AKA the psychedelic has a high body load)  

Again considering descriptions there are passages on preparation, where soma is kneaded like bread into milk and the milk turns red with what looks like blood seeping from the soma. Again this does not match an opium preparation which would be a muddy dark green, but it perfectly matches fly agaric.

 Some general tips: you want the donor bike to be a hardtail mountainbike with disc brakes, you probably do not want to buy any kit labelled 'front hub'. Geared motors have more torque and efficiency while direct drive hubs are better at speed and durability, but also have a small amount of drag when not not powered. Mid drives are neat but cost more, you can shift gears like a motorcycle which is pretty cool and great on hills. Batteries are the most expensive component by far, lipo batteries are a cheap shortcut but potentially dangerous. A good kit with decent range in your budget will be using a battery that is either  36 volt or 48, 36 will deliver more range at a decent speed while 48v is faster but will use up the battery faster too.

One of the Chinese guys would be a good kit for that price but the lead time for  their batteries can be long, you probs want to buy american if you are losing your license very soon. You could get one of these http://em3ev.com/store/index.php?route=product/product&amp;path=36&amp;product_id=138 and just pair it with whatever battery you like as long as it is 36 or 48v. Here is a good example of a more basic DD hub: http://www.yescomusa.com/products/26in-rear-electric-bicycle-motor-conversion-kit-48v-1000w ",2015-07-02 08:27:29+00:00,cspoak1,1.0,t3_3bukae,4206.0,ebikes

What material it is growing on

The temperature of the air where the mold is located

Humidity level of the room

The toxic ones thrive in areas where it is consistently humid,  has low air circulation, higher heat compared to room temperature, and there is a food source. These molds are more picky then your average mold, they eat cellulose based stuff only. That means wood, fiber, paper, wallpaper, cotton. 

They will not be found growing on tile, stone, glass, metal. But a warm woody place under your tile with high humidity? Maybe. If in this circumstance the mold is yellow or black then it could be toxic and you would want to call a professional as soon as possible. If it is green or looks like cobwebs it is not toxic. 

You can cut down on mold by using a dehumidifier

Even the CIA messes up this kind of thing all the time, and unlike them Mint would actually get more profit the less sanitized the data is. So what's the damage in this scenario? Well if your monthly medical expenditures are high then it would cause a drain on a company's health insurance plan so a prospective employer could decide not to bring you in for an interview on that basis alone.

That's all you need, it'll get you about 25-30 miles. Or you could add another 150 for a bigger pack for extra 10 miles range, probably a pretty good idea for a big trike. But even with that upgrade it would still be 400 less than the quote you got from a shop.
