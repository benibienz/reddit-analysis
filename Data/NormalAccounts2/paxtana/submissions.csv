So I need to know is this a problem with the chainring or with my installation, is it fixable etc. Do I need to adjust the derailer, or a wider chain maybe? I put a 4.5mm spacer behind the cassette to use the 7spd cassette on an 8spd body, could I fix this issue by adding more spacers behind the cassette?

It has a 3400 mah rating like the NCR-B but also has a high amperage rating (10 amps continuous per cell).  What that translates to is high power and long range in a super tight power dense package, the holy grail with battery packs.   All our shark and dolphin packs with the Panasonic GA cell put out enough power to run even a 30amp kit at continuous power without over heating. All this and you still get 13.5ah 700 watt hours in the small shark or dolphin package which fit conveniently in most bikes triangle utilizing the water battery mounting holes.

So we no longer have to make a compromise and choose between range and power when going with shark packs, we can have both.

Options that do not involve drilling: A pair of clamps 

Don't know how much weight these can take. Also seems more tricky if like mine the tube is not cylindrical. 
  
* [An option for round downtubes. Looks nice and rugged, easily removable, and is purpose built](http://www.amazon.com/Minoura-Basic-Material-Space-Mount/dp/B0089T9ZCI)
* [Hose clamps for oval tubes](http://www.amazon.com/Breeze-Power-Seal-Stainless-Worm-Drive-Bandwidth/dp/B008MG261A/), not sure if this would work by simply threading the clamp through the slot on the bracket where you would normally put M5 screws which go to the water bottle bosses, or if that would interfere with sliding the battpack into place. 
* [A couple big P clamps, aka C clamp, aka loom clamp](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Stainless-Cushioned-2-Wire-Loom-C-Clamp-Each-/262103669223?hash=item3d069899e7). Assuming the large screw affixing the clamp to the downtube can fit through the bracket hole, or that the hole is widened with a dremel. This would not be a tight fit.  
* Zipties, probably the worst idea. They sell stainless steel zipties, I wonder if those would at least be an improvement over the plastic type.

So if this ultracap is 80kW/L, how many MJ is that? About 288?

Anything will be better than what came on this walmart bike, so I am thinking of going with these cheap freehub options that cost around $15. If anyone has any feedback on the manufacturers that would be awesome since they are dirt cheap.

Option 1 is ~~[a Quando/Orbea](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Quando-Orbea-Rear-MTB-Bike-36H-6-Bolt-Disc-Hub-135mm-QR-Shimano-SRAM-7s-NEW-/331755995489?hash=item4d3e32c161:g:DU4AAOSwhkRWczfz),~~ (edit: bad idea?) which seems to be a Shimano deore knockoff at half the cost. Option 2 is ~~[a Joytech freehub](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Joytech-Freehub-8-9-Speed-Quick-Release-Freehub-36-Hole-NEW-/381542254132?hash=item58d5b0c634:g:MgMAAMXQ9qpRT8K2),~~ (bad idea?) which is nice in that it is shiny and has no disc brake (my rear uses rim brakes). Option 3 is [a shimano deore](http://www.amazon.com/Shimano-Deore-M525-A-Rear-Black/dp/B0063W76WO/ref=pd_sim_sbs_468_1?ie=UTF8&amp;dpID=31QCr25TgPL&amp;dpSrc=sims&amp;preST=_AC_UL160_SR160%2C160_&amp;refRID=0GHKKMGYJ2HMGK2Q6TPC), twice the cost and has a disc brake mount I will not use. Don't know if it's worth the extra $15.  Option 4: shimano sora 3500, seems the same as the deore but a few bucks cheaper, no unnecessary disc brake mount. Is there a difference between the two?

My chief concerns:

* The bearings. Hoping that these will spin better than the generic hub that came with the bike. 

* It would be great if I could put 13 gauge spokes through these but not a requirement. Naturally the products lack this in the description.
 
* The bike's original sprocket on the rear has 7 gears on it so I assume I will need something similar to make the shifter work but I don't know about that at all. The joytech and shimano use 8 gear cassettes at a minimum and I am not sure if that will work. 

* I do not know what sort of tool I will need to install the cassette onto the freehub. I have acquired a parktool fr-1.2 and a chain whip so far. 

* I need a cheap cassette for whichever freehub I get, was thinking of something [like this shimano](http://www.ebay.com/itm/SHIMANO-CS-HG20-HYPERGLIDE-7-SPEED-12-32T-MTB-BICYCLE-CASSETTE-/191270312609?hash=item2c88995aa1:m:mgmB0OMPQDgvHDKodf9DX4w), I assume that's decent, yes?

&gt;All paint/annodising should always be cleaned out of the taper seat on crank arms before installing.

[So I sanded a little bit in the tapered hole as seen in this pic](http://imgur.com/Dbr33Xx), and would like opinions on whether that's a good amount. Seems like the sandpaper is eating away the metal just as much as it is removing paint (BTW wow that is some soft metal) so I'm concerned that continuing to follow this course of action will negatively alter the shape of the hole. 

I see there is also some paint-like stuff on the spindle itself but I would really like some confirmation before messing with that.

* User-editable text flair is now enabled, so if you want you can put what kind of ebike you have and it will show up tagged next to your posts. Or you could put a location, URL, etc. This option is in the sidebar, [as seen here.](http://funkyimg.com/i/248Bq.jpg) Click edit, add text and hit save. We can also add image flair if you have a small image in mind.  
* Posting guidelines for sellers. [You can read these guidelines here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ebikes/wiki/postingguidelines), please read if you promote a product on this subreddit. We like hearing about new stuff and this is not a crackdown on that kind of thing but we do want to make sure it is interesting and engaging rather than annoying. 
* Wiki updates. Our wiki has been expanded and linked on the sidebar, all contributions are welcome! Pages include [an expanded ebike build comparison](https://www.reddit.com/r/ebikes/wiki/build_comparison), a [comparison of factory built ebike specs](https://www.reddit.com/r/ebikes/wiki/factory_built), and the index itself with market research on the various sellers. Further pages can be added if anyone wants to add technical research, howtos etc.
* Logo contest! If you're good with with photoshop and want to try making a custom logo for the top of the subreddit we would love to see it. This would replace the default alien logo. There's large images of the default logo you can work with [here.](https://www.reddit.com/about/alien/) 
* Approved submitter lists. I have added many of you to the list, this generally cuts down on how the spam filter treats your posts/comments. If you didn't get a notification and want on the list just say so. 
* CSS stuff, if you got anything interesting you think might be fun to do with the stylesheet we're open to changes and would love to hear from you. 
* Traffic stats: [In the past year traffic to this subreddit has tripled! Nice!](http://funkyimg.com/i/248D4.jpg)

So I been thinking, that tube will probably be replaced anyway so why not just carry a small can of fix-a-flat and spray it into the tube as a temporary fix? They make small pressurized cans meant to be carried around on a bike in the event of an emergency and it probably takes up less space than a spare tube plus tools.  But I never seen anybody recommend it, despite it seeming like a hassle free approach to dealing with the issue. 

[Here's the can I'm talking about](http://www.fixaflat.com/products/aerosol/fix-a-flat-bike/).

One told me that they think the motor qualifies it as a motor vehicle so its an insurance thing. Yet this is the same shop that was fine truing the wheel with the hub just last month. I even asked them if I could just remove the rim and give them only that but since it still has the hub in it they refused. This was after already having the bike in the store fully expecting they would work on it like they did last time.

So maybe its a fluke, right? Called the next closest bike shop and they said their corporate HQ says they can't.

NOBODY mentioned this could be an issue with bike shops in any thread I've read, whether its here or ES, anywhere. 

If this keeps up it seems like the only practical choice in the future will be mid drives since if you bring in just the wheels nobody will know its electric.

Has anyone else run into this problem with an LBS? How common is it?",ebikes,WTF. Just had two local bike shops refuse me service because it is an e-bike.,http://www.reddit.com/r/ebikes/comments/3h6u3m/wtf_just_had_two_local_bike_shops_refuse_me/
