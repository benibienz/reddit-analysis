With that being said, I have to agree with the critics and say the first part with Batgirl was terrible. I understand what they were trying to do with fleshing out her character, but it was just uncomfortable how much the script objectified her and basically just threw in a random sex scene with Bruce. She comes across as his student, not his lover, and the romance subplot seemed like nothing more than an excuse to show Batgirl in her bra to the cat-calling audience members.

311,"While Pixels was a bad movie, my concern is that if it flops, Hollywood will not want to pursue video-game based ideas. Like, actually good ones. I still want to see Wreck-It Ralph 2 and the Ratchet and Clank movie. ",2015-07-24 18:10:45+00:00,cteu550,1.0,t3_3egk35,6747.0,movies
312,I find it weird that there are so many negative reviews coming out after a bunch of people came onto reddit and  IMDB to praise Pixels. Makes me wonder if Sony had anything to do with it. Is it David Manning all over again?,2015-07-22 17:09:17+00:00,ctcawcz,1.0,t3_3e6hsb,27409.0,movies

316,"Considering the lack of hype for Ant Man and the competition it faced, I'd say the numbers are pretty good. I can't stand this opening-weekend mentality where people will write off a film if it didn't meet some ridiculous standard. Something tells me the headlines just want to put ""2nd Worst Opening"" in their title to get people to click on it. And somebody needs to write a book on how domestic and worldwide box office numbers work. I have a feeling nobody really understands it, and are all saying how they ""think"" the numbers work.",2015-07-20 22:26:34+00:00,cta7zf8,1.0,t3_3dy478,29730.0,movies
317,"With all due respect, I'd rather have a good 3D movie or sequel than a bad original movie. Putting all of the bias against 3d, sequels and remakes aside, none of that matters if the movie is good. If it is bad, people can associate its badness with the fact that is a sequel or remake. I'd rather have another sequel like Toy Story 2 than another movie like Jupiter Ascending or Old Dogs.",2015-07-16 00:59:21+00:00,ct4tynf,1.0,t3_3dflp8,10979.0,movies
