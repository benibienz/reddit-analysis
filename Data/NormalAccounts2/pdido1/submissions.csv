We got on all the rides and were about to do the Haunted Graveyard, but our tickets said 8:30 on them. We noticed how big the line would get since they were setting up metal barricades by Zoomerang and around the kiddie area. I then noticed on the flyer that it said we could get earlier times at guest services.

So we went to guest services but all of the times until 9:00 were sold out. So after waiting around until 8:30, we went back to the Graveyard entrance, only to find that the line to get in line stretched all the way around the kids area to the park entrance. It was easily more than a two-and-a-half hour wait, and we didn't want to stay out that late since we had an hour drive back home, so we left.

I really wish ACE provided earlier times on the tickets or held the event on a Sunday instead of a busy Saturday.

Wow, so I go away for two days and a huge controversy hits the internet coaster community. Of course, I am referring to Kings Dominion's livestream on saturday, where they announced that instead of an RMC Hurler or B&amp;M Wing Coaster, the park would be receiving a Planet Snoopy expansion in 2017.

In addition, they announced a new app and free wifi for the park.

This news was met with absolute disgust on Facebook, and quite a few people declared they would boycott Kings Dominion for hyping up such a small lot of additions. 

After two weeks of hype, people were furious that KD didn't deliver the goods they expected.

Now what are my thoughts on this? First and foremost I think people seriously need to calm down. Yes, Kings Dominion hasn't gotten a new coaster since 2010, but the idea that every park is entitled to a new coaster after years of not adding one just isn't realistic.

Yes, it would be awesome if every park could receive a new coaster every two or three years, but financing what to add to a park is a lot more complicated than you think. I'm sure Cedar Fair would love nothing more than to fill up their parks with coasters and family rides, but that isn't how reality works. The truth is there is a whole team of people at Cedar Fair who spend every day planning what to add to the chain's parks.

Perhaps the biggest thing they have to take into account is which additions would reap in the best return on investment. That's the reason why Cedar Point receives more coasters than smaller parks; Cedar Point is a huge name with a huge fanbase. Before I became an enthusiast, I didn't even know parks like Valley Fair or Michigan's Adventure even existed. Cedar Point is one of those parks that people all across the country visit, and so no matter how much they spend on a new coaster, they are almost guaranteed a massive return on investment.

With that being said, yes, it was an underwhelming announcement. But I seriously don't think KD was intentionally trolling their fans. I think this was more of a case of KD underestimating who the hype was appealing to. The fact that they made this such a big event and teased it on social media with pictures of the hurler was a bit of a mistake, as it caused a lot of new coaster speculation among the enthusiasts. It's obvious that Kings Dominion misjudged their audience in this case. They were clearly planning a Planet Snoopy expansion for sometime, and figured that the announcement would appeal more to families and their kids than coaster enthusiasts. If they announced it with the rest of the Cedar Fair announcments last Tuesday and held the event inside the planet Snoopy area, then there wouldn't be nearly as much backlash.

Overall   while this wasn't the announcement we were hoping for, I don't think it's fair for some people to act so entitled. Realistically, Cedar Fair doesn't owe us anything, and has a whole team of people trying their absolute hardest to please the public and stay in business. If it wasn't for these people, there wouldn't be a Kings Dominion in the first place. It's reasonable to be disappointed, but it's not reasonable to make petitions to boycott Kings Dominion or send them harsh messages demanding a new multi-million dollar coaster. 

Until this year, my home park Lake Compounce didn't get a new roller coaster for 16 years; that is quite a while, and yet we still waited patiently. And while all we ended up getting was a sky rocket 2; it's still a great addition to the park and is the only launch coaster in a hundred mile radius. Lake Compounce figured this was the year to add a new coaster, and they really impressed the public with this one. Meanwhile Kings Dominion got a giga of all coasters six years ago and people are genuinely upset at them not getting another coaster this year.  

Business decisions aren't made by which parks haven't gotten a coaster in a while; they're made by what the demographics tell would be a financially reasonable addition.

It's more important than anything to take a deep breath and understand that Cedar Fair is doing their best to successfully run their parks.

***The Following is a draft I cranked out in 12 minutes***

Roller coasters: just the sound of those two words together brings back so many incredible memories. You know those dreams you have where you can fly? The ones where gravity is non-existent and you just go flying over mountains and under bridges? That’s exactly the sensation you get riding a roller coaster. 

We’re always told to fear heights, slow down the pace and stay grounded, so naturally we have this burning desire to seek new thrills around the world. 

We’re not all qualified to fly a plane or go skydiving, but almost everyone can fasten their seatbelts and keep their hands and feet inside the vehicle. 

I remember riding The incredible Hulk back in 2003 and being blown away with how fast I was going. That unexpected launch was perhaps the most jaw-dropping experience I ever felt at the time. At first I was petrified. I thought I would fly right off the track and into the lagoon, but let me tell you, once I got used to it, I was having the time of my friggin' life. It was like I was dreaming; like I was soaring through the air on a green dragon going up down and upside down.

In the past few years, the industry has been reaching new heights and speeds to keep up with our growing need to seek excitement. The sheer radiance and magnificence of a coaster’s architecture draws us to them, but the pure exhilaration keeps us coming back for more. A new generation of coaster enthusiasts is growing up with that rides that many thought were impossible. The best part? We get to experience them for a simple price of admission.

5-8 years of experience in any analytical function covering market demographics, consumer lifestyles and social trends (a must)

It is a rough draft and I would like some feedback if possible. If you like or hate it, feel free to let me know.

The trailers leading up to Guardians of the Galaxy made it look like a wacky sci-fi comedy While the movie certainly has its silly moments, it’s certainly not full-blown comedy many expected it to be. In fact, it may be one of the darkest films Marvel has put out yet.

Based on the marketing alone, one could easily go into this film expecting a thrilling, action-packed opening scene. Boy, people were sure in for quite a surprise.

The film actually opens up with the main character’s mother dying of cancer. No joke; a film may expected to be a funny little sci-fi escapade opened up with a scene that’s the complete opposite of funny. In fact, it’s pretty damn tragic.

Peter Quill is introduced as a young boy whose mother is about to die from some form of cancer. His mother wants him to hold her hand before she dies, but Peter is too grief-stricken to face death. 

As a result, his mother dies before he gets a chance to say goodbye, which will haunt his character for the rest of the movie.
The audience isn’t really given a chance to know who these people are. In fact, the movie just kind of throws them into a scene that many could assume is from The Fault in Our Stars. It relies on the knee-jerk sympathy of seeing a kid’s mom die of cancer, and yet it still somehow works.

The main reason why this scene works is because of how jarring it is. People went in expecting a comedy and were greeted with super-serious character development. It’s almost as if the movie is saying: “you thought this was going to be a silly little sci-fi film? Here’s a main character with a tragic backstory.”

Having gone through a traumatic event like that really sets the stage for Peter's character throughout the rest of the film. In an intergalactic world, he's a truly human character with regrets and feelings. He's much more than the wise-cracking goofball audiences were expecting.",movies,About Guardians of the Galaxy's Opening Scene.,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/4mwiul/about_guardians_of_the_galaxys_opening_scene/

It spreads rumors, but news sources often report the rumors as facts for some reason. If The Tracking Board is such an inaccurate source, why is it so popular?

-Spider-Man's role in the film

-Ant-Man's role in the Civil War

-The Winter Soldier coming to terms with who he is.

-Why Black Widow is on Tony Stark's side. (as revealed today)

-The Vision's role in the Civil War.

-Crossbones' backstory.

Is it possible for Marvel to fit all of these plotlines into a single film or can some of these be left out?

I have decided to share the work in progress on reddit so it can receive feedback. Whether it is good or bad is up to you to decide. Here is what I have so far. Be advised that this is not finished yet:

Title: If Nintendo Wants to make movies, here's what they should do.

Article: In a recent interview, Nintendo head designer Shigeru Miyamoto (宮本 茂) said that the company may finally start taking their beloved franchises to the big screen. Miyamoto said:

“We’ve had, over the years, a number of people who have come to us and said ‘Why don’t we make a movie together—or we make a movie and you make a game and we’ll release them at the same time?’ Because games and movies seem like similar mediums, people’s natural expectation is we want to take our games and turn them into movies… I’ve always felt video games, being an interactive medium, and movies, being a passive medium, mean the two are quite different….As we look more broadly at what is Nintendo’s role as an entertainment company, we’re starting to think more and more about how movies can fit in with that—and we’ll potentially be looking at things like movies in the future.”

In summary, Nintendo realizes that taking something interactive like a video game and turning it into something more passive like a movie is a challenging process. However, expanding Nintendo into different forms of entertainment is still something that the company is interested in doing.

Perhaps the most important thing that Nintendo should (and hopefully will) consider is that video game characters and references alone aren't enough to sell a film, or make it good. A game-to-movie adaptation must properly utilize its licensed characters while staying faithful to what made them famous.

The last attempt at a movie based on a Nintendo property was 1993's Super Mario Bros., a disastrous attempt to make a gritty, marketable film for general audiences. It ended up failing with critics and audiences and is still known as being one of the worst and most unfaithful game-to-movie adaptations of all time (as if most video game movies were ever faithful to begin with).

Even to this day, studios like Sony Pictures and 20th Century Fox are pretty much incapable of making a good video game movie, as evidenced by this year's Pixels and Hitman: Agent 47 respectively. Studio higher-ups could care less about making game-to-movie adaptations respectful and memorable and more about giving them flashy aesthetics hoping that they could gross enough money from casual crowds. Most of today's current studio executives did not grow up with video games, and thus do not have an interest in them to begin with. This leads to them hiring writers and directors who don't understand what people love about video games or how to put that love into a film.

Pixels was a mashup of awful jokes and unlikable characters mixed with the occasional video game character and/or 80s song to trigger knee-jerk nostalgic reactions. The effects were nice, but the film treats its licensed characters with no real respect or understanding. Instead, it just throws the characters on screen and hopes that enough people will go ""hey, I remember that"" and forget about the poor overall quality of the script. It was the film equivalent of fruit stripe gum; it gives gamers a short burst of nostalgia before making them indifferent with an overall lackluster film.

Hitman: Agent 47 took the slick, stealth-based elements of the video games and traded them in for generic wannabe-matrix-style setpieces, guns and explosions. Once again, the people behind the film took no interest in what people love about the games and instead slapped the licence onto an easy-to-write action film to wring a few bucks out of audiences.

It's obvious that the creators of the games had little to no involvement in these movies. Therefore, it would be interesting to see what Nintendo could do if they themselves produce their own films. Hopefully, the movies will be much more faithful to the beloved games that inspired them and really give a sense of what drives fans to play the games.
