60,"Quem tem rinite alérgica sabe bem: basta ocorrer uma mudança de tempo que o nariz começa a coçar e escorrer, os olhos a lacrimejar e os espirros não dão um descanso. Mas um tratamento desenvolvido pelo doutor Edmir Américo Lourenço, professor de Otorrinolaringologia na Faculdade de Medicina de Jundiaí, em São Paulo, pode mudar isso.

Ao longo de dez anos o médico conduziu uma pesquisa para descobrir uma forma de melhorar a qualidade de vida para os pacientes que sofrem com a rinite alérgica. No resultado final do estudo, publicado em março no periódico Internacional Archives of Torhinolaryngology, Lourenço explica queconseguiu desenvolver um tratamento que, em seus testes, apresentou bons resultados em 80% dos pacientes.

O médico analisou as reações de 281 pacientes. Em um primeiro momento, foram realizados testes nas peles deles, de forma a verificar quais são as causas da alergia de cada um. A partir disso, vacinas específicas — são cerca de 30 doses aplicadas ao longo de um ano e dois meses — para cada paciente foram desenvolvidas em laboratório.

""As vacinas estimulam a formação de defesas próprias, de anticorpos específicos contra as causas de alergia"", explicou Lourenço. Segundo ele, os pacientes não deixam de ser alérgicos, porém deixam de apresentar aqueles sintomas de sempre, o que já melhora consideravelmente a qualidade de suas vidas.

No momento o tratamento só está disponível em clínicas particulares por cerca de R$ 1,5 mil.

117,"&gt; What's gaming culture like in Brasil? Is it something a lot of young people do in general?  
Yes. A lot of young people here play videogames, specially minecraft for those between 7~11 years old.  

&gt; What games are popular?  
GTA V, Counter Strike, League of Legends, Dota II, etc.  

&gt; Do people play in LAN centers mostly, or at home?  
Mostly, we play at home. LAN centers will probably be extinct in a few years.  

&gt; What else can you tell me, about brazilian gaming culture (other than being looked on as the russians of the americas)?  
Trolls are really common here.
