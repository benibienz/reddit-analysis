10,"Ok, I took [/r/Overwatch's stylesheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/overwatch/about/stylesheet), [beautified](http://www.cleancss.com/css-beautify/) it, cut it down to the bits I thought might be relevant (below), and stuck it in RES's ""snippet"" area.

It kinda works, but:

1. It messes up user comment pages, e.g. /u/spez/  (should be disabled for them)
2. ~~It adds an unneeded gap on the left of comments (where user flair icons go on /r/overwatch)~~ (fixed)
3. It probably missed some @media and .res-nightmode bits and pieces
4. It probably includes ~~extra bits~~ a lot of css that isn't needed

Anyone able to fix it or have a more elegant solution?

538 had a good article on ""Why [Their] [Model Is More Bullish Than Others On Trump""](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-why-our-model-is-more-bullish-than-others-on-trump/)

One of the biggest factors that stood out to me is that FiveThirtyEight model is calibrated based on general elections since 1972.

&gt; If we calibrated the model based on presidential elections since 2000 only — which have featured largely accurate polling — Clinton’s chances would rise to 95 percent [from 83 percent at the time the story was published], and Trump’s would fall to 5 percent.

So if 2016 has accurate polling then Trump's chances diminish, and polling has been accurate for the last few elections, but that doesn't mean they will be necessarily again this year.

The article goes into other assumptions of the model.

Some other things they've mentioned elsewhere is that they don't especially take into account early voting (too difficult because it's new). Also the Latino/Hispanic vote appears to much higher this year.",2016-11-06 15:00:52+00:00,d9o6f76,4.0,t1_d9o48pd,3989.0,EnoughTrumpSpam

As much as people here seem to be happy to downplay, apologize, or find ways to reinterpret it, the rest of the world doesn't see it as minor, especially not his own party. Most people can hear that Trump is talking about sexual assault. The [RNC is stopping funding of his campaign]( http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/rnc-halts-all-victory-project-work-for-trump-229363). 17 Trump-supporting GOP officials have rescinded their support; and 19 called on him to quit the race altogether (according to [fivethirtyeight's count](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republican-officials-are-fleeing-trump-in-droves/)). The republican party is cutting its losses. Trump is done. Trump diehards will take some time to come to grips with it, and will blame the media and everyone else they can, but their candidate was never fit to run in the first place.

Clinton using one blackberry instead of two, or Trump being racist, or Pence advocating electroshock therapy for gay people, or someone allegedly overhearing Clinton joke about droning Assange (I never heard any actual evidence of this), or Trump asking why don't we use nukes, or Kaine acting like a smug dickhead—all that shit is pissing in the wind compared to what the vast majority of people do not see as merely joking around, but as Trump confessing to a pattern of sexual assault.

As for independents, yes, I understand they're higher in the polls than usual. Hillary is still not popular, and people seek an alternative to the two major parties. But minor party support is often lost around election time. Unfortunately, the US does not have a preferential voting system which would allow a person's vote to still count after giving their first preference to a minor candidate. 

Perhaps if Hillary supporters all assume she's already won and don't show up Trump could sneak in. Perhaps some greater scandal will show up. But realistically at this point it's basically over for Trump. Don't think this is a minor scandal like the many others.

176,"The change to the Reborn client (which happened between 6.84c and 6.85) seems like it would have been a good time to increment that major version number, but that was considered just a ""patch"" release rather than a gameplay (""game version"") update.

If major version numbers were based on major rule changes, I think a major change might be something like changing how damage and armor types work, but they did that e.g. in 6.82, removing Composite and Universal damage types and it probably wasn't that big a deal.

Perhaps something that altered the fundamentals of the game: the very finite size of the map, the leveling system, the 5v5 start-from-scratch nature of the game with a defined start and end, Roshan and the shopkeeper being non-playable characters. These are my random ideas of the sorts of things that would need to change to warrant a major version increase.

Basically, it would take one of the custom games becoming more popular than the regular game mode and taking over, which I don't see happening any time soon.

Because dota has so many items, spells, rules and interactions, it can't change quickly without frustrating many people, so I don't see any major change happening really.

There are a lot of ray-finned fish species out there. The article says 33,000 species. To put it in perspective, there's only ~5000 mammals world wide. When I tried creating a [list of the fishes the IUCN Red List lists as ""least concern""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_least_concern_fishes) on Wikipedia, which is mostly ray-finned fish, the page was so large Wikipedia struggled to display it and needed some custom optimized templates created for it. It remains the 11th largest page on Wikipedia. And it lists just 60% of the half of the fish species that the IUCN has been able to assess the conservation status of.

Adam Summers and colleagues have scanned 1021 fish so far (according to the google doc found on the above page). So I guess they're about 3% done?

And as mmaster23 pointed out, the implementation would create a lot of extra computation both for yourself and Google to compare the two (possibly different) versions of the file. You may seen how long a large torrent or Steam game can take to verify/hash. That hashing has to be done on the server side too. For a Steam game, Steam only has to work out the masterhash once (per version of the game) and all users can compare their own hashes to see if it's a match (if so, the game's fine. If not, download again). For a torrent, the hashes are calculated by the original uploader. For Google Drive, Google would have to calculate a hash for every file you upload and every version of that file (imagining changing a single byte of a gigabyte file every minutes). That would be a huge burden for someone's computer resources just to allow faster syncing in a rare use case.

That's all assuming that data integrity is crucial and that's it's important to verify versions are exactly the same.

No one wants to carry and worry about an adapter. No one wants to have to charge another device twice a day. And it's not like you can't use wireless headphones already. 

That 5 or 10 seconds of fiddling in settings reconnect phone and headphones might not aeem like much but it makes for a shitty user experience and makes you appreciate the reliability of just plugging in. Not to mention the ease of unplugging to quickly stop. 

Also for some reason volume controls on Bluetooth always seem to go from ""fairly quiet"" to ""zero"" without anything in between. There's finer control when wired. 

And there's a constant fear of accidentally pressing a button too long and having your phone decide to redial your last number at 3am. Apple does not let you disable this feature that is standard on many bt devices. (which is enough reason alone for my next phone to be Android)

220,"Perhaps, but not really any more.

As others have pointed out, it's grammatical to rue other things. But the verb is now considered [obsolete or archaic](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rue#Etymology_2) so it's not productive. 

Having a look at other phrases following the ""[rue the *blank*](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=rue+the+*&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=16&amp;smoothing=3)"" pattern in Google's Ngram Viewer, ""rue the day"" is about 160× more popular than the next most common ruing which is ""rue the time""

The ten most popular ""rue the [blank]"" phrases are:

* rue the day
* rue the time
* rue the consequences
* rue the exchange
* rue the delay
* rue the bargain
* rue the loss
* rue the deed
* rue the moment

Other phrases use ""rue"" in other ways, i.e. not followed by ""the"", such as ""rue my heart"" or ""rue it to eternity"", ""rue his pertinacity"", but they're hard to find because ""rue"" means ""street"" or ""road"" in French, so [results are hard to filter](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=rue_VERB+*_NOUN&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3) because of ""[La rue Jacob](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rue_Jacob)"", etc. 

However, none of these are any where near as popular as ""rue the day"", and I doubt you'll find anything nearly as common as this phrase.

261,"&gt; Eleven character-level variables comprised this portion.  e  rst set of these variables dealt with the sexualization of the character and followed a coding structure adapted from Downs and Smith (2010). We observed four areas of a character’s body (i.e., the chest, buttock, waist, and leg regions) as well as their movements for sexualiza- tion (0 – not present, 1 – present). We summed the  ve variables into a sexualization index (0 – Least sexualized to 5 – Most sexualized; M = 1.34, SD = 1.55; Cronbach’s α = .80). We considered characters of low resolution (e.g., 8-bit sprites) or who never appeared on screen as indeterminable and assigned them index scores of zero.

&gt; Regions featuring secondary sex characteristics (i.e., the chest, buttocks, and waist) could be sexualized in multiple ways but still only constituted one potential point on the sexualization index. We considered chests sexualized if we observed one or more of the following: breasts disproportionate to the body size (α = .81), bare skin between the armpits and bottoms of the breasts (α = .70), or accentuation by garments or artis- tic styling (e.g., shading; α = .73). We observed sexualized buttocks if skin was exposed from the top of the hips to the bottom of the buttocks (α = .71) or if adornments or art styling accentuated the buttocks (α = .74). We considered waists sexualized if the character’s midri  area in the front or back of the body was bare (α = .80) or if the waist to hip shape was exaggerated (α = .78). We considered the leg region sexual- ized if the skin on the legs was exposed from the hip area to the top of the character’s knees (α = .95). Finally, we determined the presence of sexualized movement (α = .75) if the character’s movements included unnecessary undulation or jiggling that drew attention to their body in a sexual manner. Supplemental images demonstrating the variance of sexualized portrayals across time are available from the  rst author.  e distribution was highly positively skewed. To avoid violating the assumption of nor- mality for use in parametric tests we performed a log transformation on the index. Although we used these transformed data in our analyses, we report the untrans- formed means and standard deviations for ease of interpretation.

419,"Cool. Hating on RPGs is one of my favourite things.

Grinding is a problem in many ways. I think you could basically write a book on the grinding problem, so I'm going to expand on that one a bit:

* it's inherently boring
* you don't know if you need to grind first to level up to defeat some enemy. This causes the player to consider the metagame (how to game the game rather than how to play the game), and thus takes them out of the experience.
* becoming OP: grinding is also a problem because if you grind too much you become overpowered and the rest of the game becomes boring. (Some people enjoy God Mode, but kinda defeats the point of a game)
* Basically the problem with RPGs is the difficulty curve of the game can be skewed massively too hard or too easy by how many or few random goblins you bother killing, and the game designer either has given up control over that, or makes levelling up meaningless (e.g. by boosting monster stats proportionally to player's level)

Some RPGs have found clever ways to reduce the grinding problem somewhat, but I think it's an inherent problem across all RPGs. (And some people might enjoy the grind or whatever, YMMV)

Other things I have a problem with in RPGs. (Again, each one might be your favourite thing ever, but this is my list):

* Gear micromanagement — optimising what goes in which slots, and which gems in which gem slots, and selling junk, repairing stuff, finding which of your 58 bracelets gives the best stats, etc, etc. 
* Single use items (stocking up on them ""just in case"", and also ""Items that are too good to use"" as mentioned)
* Exploration which requires replaying the game to try each choice
* Searching around for ages for the sake of dumb quests
* not knowing where you are going 
* memorizing some rock/paper/scissors combat/magic systems
* riddles
* gear that breaks
* generic or highly customized player character so has no story
* huds. especially large huds and menus (take you out of the experience)
* NPCs who stand around with an exclamation point over their head and have no routine or life other than that
* random encounters 
* lack of a jump button

The last one is the biggest flaw with almost every RPG and also the easiest to solve.",2016-05-25 01:26:41+00:00,d3iib0e,1.0,t3_4kwgiv,10848.0,gamedesign

464,"I've been spamming dp since back in the day when if she ulti'd without any big items or allies (with stuns), everyone would just walk away. And yeah, it was sad not seeing her picked in tournaments. But she was more about taking objectives and making it uncomfortable for the enemy in a team fight in my scrub games. That is, she was exactly where Jakiro is now. Ice Frog reworked DP and now she's viable and gets tournament play, and it wasn't by giving her more exorcism spirits or changing spell ranges.

The post is humor. It obviously resonates with a bunch of people or no one would have up voted. It might be jibe at Jakiro, but it's also a plea to Mr Ice Frog. The buffs he's given to Jakiro still leave Macropyre more ignorable than pretty much any other ulti (except situationally when it synergizes, and in combination with veil, lens and atos, as many have pointed out). Pretty much every other ulti is something you have to respond to, whereas if you're fast enough or tanky enough you can just ignore Macropyre, even casting/channelling your own ults while standing in it, or just walk out of it and all it does is a little zoning. Jakiro makes up for it by having a bunch of other spells he can spam ad nauseam, but having a bunch of spells that are all mild just makes him mediocre.

The problem isn't that Jakiro is bad or loses matches, it's that he's ignorable. I don't know know what the solution is to make Jakiro more interesting. Maybe I'm a little biased against the hero because I once spent the last hour of a 90 minute game spamming all his spells defending against megas and it was soul-destroyingly boring (and we lost).

My solution to fixing dp (before she got reworked) would have been to buff atos, allowing it build into something [similar to bloodthorn](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/49cw0y/687_predictions/d0re0sc?context=3), which I still had in mind when I suggested/predicted something similar to bloodthorn before bloodthorn was added.

My fav suggestion I've seen for fixing Jak is to let macropyre [cook enemies in their own armor](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/4hmzfa/psa_dont_stand_in_macropyre_the_whole_time_while/d2rb8wy).

475,"Mostly I cringe when people write missing flavour text posts. Yours aren't terrible, so I'll give some feedback/criticism.

Overall, when I get to the first comma in each one, that's where I think you should have stopped writing. It's flavour text, not a bible of lore. Explaining what the item/ability does is optional (it's already in the description). 

If anything, the flavour text should give an idea of who should buy the item / what situation it's used. 

----

&gt; Spirit Siphon: The malevolent energies of the undead tear into the souls of lesser beings, forcefully sustaining Krobelus's unwanted immortality.

It's poetic and all, but it's overwritten. It's very heavy on long words (the last 5 words average 9 characters). And it's cramming too many ideas into one sentence. Could be shortened to something like: 

&gt; Malevolent energies of the undead sustain her.

----

This:

&gt; Tricks of the Trade: Sometimes the best way to remain unseen is to leave no witnesses at all.

Is much better. You could even remove the words ""Sometimes"" and/or ""at all"", but it's good as is.

----

You've used this pattern for ~~almost~~ all items: 

&gt; &lt;Item&gt;: &lt;where it came from&gt;, &lt;what it does&gt;.

eg

&gt; Faerie Fire: Cinders left behind by an elder faerie dragon, said to unlock a user's hidden strength when they need it the most.

Having a look through items existing flavour texts, some follow this pattern, but many simply give a hint of mystery (""A circlet with faint whispers echoing about it"") and others give a hint as to who they're useful for (""Magi equipped with these boots are valued in battle.""). You should try mixing up which patterns you use.

----
&gt; improves the spellcasting prowess

Sounds a bit weak. Not evocative. Like you're grasping for another way to say ""Increases spell damage by x%"".

----

I'm going to be stupid pedantic:

&gt; Infused Raindrops: Holy water blessed by a high priest...

Infused is different to blessed. (But mostly I'm complaining because I think ""blessed"" items are silly)

----

&gt; ...~~it was rumored that~~ each of his attacks struck with the force of two well-trained blows.

Cut weasel words. Might as well say ""It was said in flavor text"". *Rumored* doesn't add anything here.

----

&gt; infernal strength to pierce light armor

sounds oxymoronic. Also *pierce* has a specific meaning in dota so should probably be avoided.

----

&gt; fragment of a dragon's untold perception

I have no idea what this means

----
So overall advice:

* Edit them down like you're tweeting. No time for reading novels while on the battlefield.

* Kill your darlings: you don't need everything in there.

* Mix up the pattern of writing. Give more situational info (like arcane boots), or sometimes just sum up an object (""The headpiece of a dead necromancer""), or sometimes try to create lore (like your text before the comma), but don't try to do everything in each.

484,"The nerfs to DP aren't so terrible, and they'll hopefully stop everyone complaining so much. First time she's been nerfed in a long time. It's annoying that siphon gets ""stuck"" in shadows now, I thought the complaint was that it gave vision around the target, not simply that it shows where they are. But whatever. Siphon can't connect with BKB'd units now but it seemed kinda weird that it could before anyway.

Wind Lace means it's easier to keep siphon going. With the 1 second extra duration probably means an extra attack while siphoning, before even buying boots. Wind Lace stacks with euls and drums (and yasha), so you can get a little more cheap movement speed if you want to try and almost relive the old racecar-style Witchcraft DP.

Blight stone combines with DP's ulti to do more damage to heroes and towers. How much difference -2 armor does I'm not sure, but seems worthwhile for the price.

Infused raindrop seems pretty legit. It could counter crypt swarm, but on the other hand it might save you buying a cloak early game when up against a zeus or tinker. Shadow Demon seemed to waste two charges of it with one shadow poison attack[?].

Tomb of Knowledge is useful to push you over to 11 or 16. No one else seemed to care about getting it in my games but I don't know how contested this item will become within a team as people become more familiar with the patch.

585,"Wow that was quick. Overall it's an improvement and it's not bad. I like the format. But here's some notes..

Firstly, quick recommendation, add a watermark that says ""Pre-alpha gameplay"" (or similar) to the whole video. Sure, it's obvious that it is, and it's implied, and you say it, *but* you probably don't want journalists or anyone else taking footage from this 2 years down the track and thinking it's what your game is.

Overall, I thought it was too slow to get started. It might seem like necessary set up to explain things, but if just skip to 5:00 minutes in and start with ""This is your territory"" I think would be much better. You can get to the other unit types at the end. And you can introduce the different things as they come into play. E.g. ""I'm going to place a sniper construct now. The constructs I have available are here on the right (of the HUD). The ones on the left are functions, and I'll get to those in a second"") 

Sometimes it's hard to tell what you're looking at or pointing out. E.g. when you say ""This is your territory"" you should probably say ""All the green hexagons are my territory."" And maybe giving a little more detail when something happens like ""It looks like I've just captured it, which happens when enough triangle things surround it for x seconds"" or the like.

It would be more engaging if you got a second person to play against, so it would be like ""Jane is using a nerf function here so you can see it's slowing my units, but it's also slowing her own, so I'm going to respond with..."" etc. But the video is still fine how it is.

Sound effects: I'm guessing you haven't added sound effects to the game yet. But even very basic blips and buzzes would help the viewer notice what's going on. The game just looks mesmerising, and the odd click or boom would help draw focus to events that are going on. I'd highly recommend having a go at adding some sound effects to the game, even if they're just simple temporary ones.",2016-03-02 02:30:15+00:00,d0k7glx,3.0,t1_d0k5pin,2488.0,Unity3D

&gt; ... script types ... 

&gt; ... compiler system ... 

&gt; ... mods and functions ...

You really need to give a basic ""hello world"" example, and then expand from there. Like the viewer is going through a tutorial: The player is trying to achieve something. They have this simple construct available. They try it, it works/doesn't work, but now they have unlocked the fusion compiler mod function system or whatever and let's see what happens with that, and then here's one we prepared earlier that shows all the lego constructed into a giant castle.

588,"&gt; By not waiting, Delilah denied herself yet another avenue to escape her real life with another extramarital dalliance while simultaneously encouraging Henry to follow her lead (or at the very least not giving Henry that option).

Fair enough. I didn't get that out of it or see that at all. And it seems to be stretching the story's meaning of ""escape"" to consider the two of them coming together to be an escape from reality. To me it would have been a way for them to leave end their escapist ways. (thus, why I thought you were saying she was static: she was there in the first place to escape, and now she's escaping again [which is how others have described it])

Perhaps I'm heartless, but I saw Henry's marriage as unsalvageable: she already has people who love her looking after her, and why on Earth would I want to go to Melbourne, Australia. (I live here IRL). To me, Henry's story was about was about moving on, or finding a way to live with what happened, and not about going back to it. If it was a movie instead of a game, and Henry decided to fly to Australia it may have been heartwarming and would feel like a resolution, but it wasn't, and there's no resolution in having another person tell you that's what you should do. To me it was just a ""Hey, why not fuck off to Australia?""

Delilah's other relationship was only hinted at pretty obliquely (I probably missed some of the hints). Did she even mention it when you talk to her at the end? Maybe if it was more explicit (ala Ned's confession) I wouldn't have felt ""robbed"". As many others have said, it just seemed lazy and pointless to end it that way, like the writers just needed a quick way to not create a character model for Delilah.",2016-03-01 02:16:08+00:00,d0iv00k,8.0,t1_d0issp2,3355.0,IndieGaming

People change through a story. It's an arc. I can't believe you would have thought it would have broken her character for her to have stayed.

If she died in the fire, at least that would have been an ending to be annoyed at, instead of her just being like ""whatever, I just caught an early flight, why don't you fuck off to Australia?"" Or if she or you talked more frankly about why she left it could have left a feeling of resolution (maybe she does in other dialogue trees to the ones I chose?). Maybe the ending was obvious to you, to me (and evidentially to a lot of people) it was just ""what was the point of that?"" Maybe if the game ended with you sitting in an empty tower, it could have made the point better.

I didn't necessarily expect to meet her (as you don't tend to meet many people in the game), but I expected that promise to at least be subverted in an interesting way.

Well that was what the game was leading up to. If they're going to subvert that ending then at least have some unexpected, surprise reason.

It's for the same reason you can't zoom out more. The game likes to present you with less information than could fit on the screen, forcing you to make decisions about which information you want to spend time seeing.

Clicking on heroes, whether your own team's or your opponents, is considered to be an element of the game.

Coincidently, this is exactly the same chance of getting any combination of heroes. I got Meepo then Io then Slarder. [What are the odds?!](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Improbable_things_happen) Same tiny chance! You can't look at the odds after the fact and use that in any meaningful way. For it to be a meaningful thing, you would have to predict that someone else would get the same combination (i.e. 3x Silencer) more often than chance and then try to run the experiment: note down who they random each time. I doubt you'll get 3x Silencer again.

Random numbers contain repeats more often than humans tend to think. With common repeats ""looking"" less random, even when they're just as random. E.g. see this quote from random.org:

&gt; Sometimes people email us to say that they feel the Die Roller produces too many repeated numbers (e.g., that it is hard to roll five dice without getting two or more identical rolls) or that the Coin Flipper produces too many heads or tails when used with several coins. Such concerns are great illustrations of how difficult it is for humans to deal with randomness. **Human brains are so good at finding patterns that we tend to see them even where they aren't.** (This is why statistical tests are useful and why the Real-Time Statistics for RANDOM.ORG's numbers are published online.) ([more...](https://www.random.org/faq/#Q2.8))

It's also why Dota uses ""pseduorandom"" numbers for a bunch of stuff: ""true"" random doesn't seem ""random"" enough, at least not enough like what humans think random looks like.

693,"Butterfly also gives attack speed (+30 vs +35 for AC). They give different sorts of tankiness. AC lets you stand in a fight longer, but butterfly gives you a better chance of getting away from a heavy damage dealer, even someone with desolater or rapier. And the active lets you run a little faster when you start to get away (which would be good with treads). Plus you get some more damage. AC is generally more practical though. I've been building it more and treating SC as the poor-man's AC (or as a semi support item if we have a hard carry who's struggling to stay alive). Shivas isn't a bad option either if someone else is getting AC, or shadowblade for that attack speed.

One thing I've realised recently is how long it's been taking me to come online. Had one match where I didn't get my first kill until 28 minutes, second at 46, but ended up with an 8 kill streak and won the match. Meanwhile our Tiny had blink+aghs before I had phase boots+euls. So I've gone back to buying BoTs early now so I can always be pushing a lane and get farm that way. i.e. phase boots &gt; euls &gt; BoTs. It's kinda dumb ending up with two boots but seems like the best way to maintain movement speed and presence. Only if I get 6 slotted will I sell the phase boots.

Felt like I couldn't escape easily enough, or keep siphon going easily enough. The stats were good, but not enough to compensate. I struggled to remember to tread switch, and often just stayed on strength for the health boost early on.

My early build has gotten pretty standard now. Phase boots, Euls (sometimes the sage mask before phase boots are done), Point booster, extra void stone (that I don't build into anything), OC, and then whatever luxury items and BoTs. I'll rush a bottle after one blades-of-attack if I'm mid but often I'll go in a lane.

To get some attack speed + damage, butterfly or shadow blade are nice, but I'm going well enough to get them (usually after BoTs, buyback, heart) we'll probably win whatever I buy anyway.

I've stopped getting medallion / solar crest lately and just getting an extra void stone just to spam those spells (can be built into a sheep stick or linkens just to feel like it wasn't bought for nothing).

I've gone heart a bunch of times with DP. Looking at my stats it's about 10 games in 50, though I got through phases. It's good especially when you need to be the tank to protect your team of glass cannons carries (though AC would be good for that too). The main time I can think of though is when you're up against techies. Then you can be in the front line and just walk over mines and not care. Or against bristleback, you can just stand next to him and slowly bring him down even if he's got blademail and then walk away and be full health soon after, or to let you walk away from pudge hooks. Or to survive a bunch of stuns and disables while exorcising without needing BKB. Seems less important now with siphon dealing good damage to tankers and holding them away. I'd almost always get OC first though, and heart isn't that helpful unless you get some armor and/or magic resist to go with it.

Will try it again some time. Still haven't worked up the courage to try treads tho :)

I demo'd DP and practiced last hitting with and without treads, and even when switched to agility they don't seem to make all that much difference. The things that really seem to help is getting close to the creep you're trying to hit, and getting more damage. Even with a moonshard or seven it can be hard to last hit from max distance.

Using siphon to slow in the middle of a big fight is fine, but chasing someone with it I feel like you need phase boots. But I'll have to try treads. Also the extra damage from phase boots helps with last hitting too.

&gt; you say you dont really like grieves because she is likely to die before using them, my only comment is that. IF you die before using ANY ITEM, thats your fault not the item's fault.
 
Fair call :) I can't say I've really tried her with grieves. I'll sometimes get a pipe after euls+orctarine if we're up against heavy magic (e.g. luna or zeus) and I'm not feeling the need for more tankiness or whatever. Gets pretty situational at that point. 

AC is definitely a good item but I don't feel like there's enough item slots or time to build damage items so the extra attack speed seems wasted on DP.

705,"Had a couple more games with 6.86 DP and maybe I underestimated her spirit siphon. It's pretty strong, especially in a team fight where you can go nuts with it and grab everyone around, holding them and getting some heals while your ulti decimates them. It's good in laning too for either just for harassing or for siphoning an enemy siege creep in lane for a quick health boost (if you have the mana spare). Starting to wonder if I could get by without tangos but that's probably too much of a risk for the small price saved.

I'm not a huge fan of wand because it's not always reliable for getting charges, and I seem to end up only using it once or twice before it's time to selling it (tho sometimes that's enough to be worth it), and it just delays getting euls. I'll get it if I'm laning against a bristleback or other heavy magic user tho. I usually get a couple of clarities and sometimes get more delivered.

I've gotta admit I haven't really tried treads on DP tho I've seen a pro player do it once. I used to get tranquils a lot, but don't really need the heal that much (especially now you can even siphon a jungle creep). So I started getting brown boots and upgrading straight to BoTs after a euls and maybe part of an OC (sometimes making mana boots along the way) But that's not so viable now with her nerfed move speed. I can't really imagine using her without phase boots now just cause it makes keeping a siphon on someone easy, which lets you get your ulti onto them too (or lets the rest of your team catch up and get them too)

Mid is usually ideal, but as long as the game isn't too fast, you can generally jungle a bit after you got a bit more mana and catch up so I usually actually play her as a lane support, but not the main support if possible. One good thing about DP is she can fill any role needed, especially now she has a little crowd control. Mid, solo offlane, lane support, and I guess hard support.

I've played her as support plenty of times (today, in fact) but I'll just get courier and wards and items that might help in a team fight like atos, SC, shivas, etc, but rarely mech or greves.. I feel like DP's too likely to die before getting a chance to them but that might just be an excuse. I should probably try it some time. I try to do hard support but I find it hard to commit to it. I'll try it next time I need to.

AC is a great item for DP, but I tend to hope someone else will build it, much like desolater. Medalion/SC though I can't rely on a support to shine the right guy who I'm targetting with exorcism just at that very moment. It'd be like QoP getting a support to orchid for her. Though the stats tell me I'm much alone in getting medallion/SC on DP.

Oh yeah, medallion is also good for those brief stints of jungling while your ulti's on CD that will let you farm up your OC faster. People will tell you that DP isn't meant to jungle but whatever. You're low on health and heading back to base anyway. Might as well. It helps.

Medallion is only 1200 so it's not really setting you back much in your big item purchases. And the armor is like bonus HP. You can upgrade it to SC when you've got nothing else to buy or you think you need it.",2015-12-17 17:17:36+00:00,cy2e4r6,4.0,t1_cy28clf,9337.0,learndota2

*edit: or another way to look at it: 6.85 boots of speed + max witchcraft: 395 movespeed. 6.86 boots of speed + euls: 395 M.S. You used to get a ""free"" euls worth of speed from your passive.

709,"&gt; keep buying bloodstone on her. DONT JUST DONT.

I've been saying bloodstone is terrible on DP since OC came into being, but she feels a lot more mana-limited in the new patch (pretty sure she's lost the mana reductions from her old passive) so I'm starting to wonder if it's useful again.

The one time I'd get Bloodstone (in 6.85) was when I was up against a Tiny or Spirit Breaker and needed the extra HP to survive their ganks, then I'd skip euls and rush bloodstone. Didn't try it often though and not sure how well that would work now.

Also, whether you're going bloodstone or not, much cheaper than AC is medallion and it gives you a mana boost and some needed armor too, so I'd usually buy it after euls as an in-between item. In the end your exorcism largely only targets one enemy at a time, so you can shine it on the target and they fall apart fast. I don't know why medallion/solar crest isn't more popular on DP. Solar crest is nice too for after you've ulited you can sit back and still help team fights with some shines, where otherwise you feel like you're as likely to get killed as you are to assist.

I've played 500+ matches with her. But I don't enjoy playing with her in 6.86 because she moves as slow as mud now. (They buffed her move speed but it doesn't compensate for the loss of the passive bonus) I didn't realise before how much the racecar speed made her fun to play.

That doesn't mean the changes weren't good. She's a lot more balanced now. The passive was a kinda silly skill, and she badly needed a way to slow the enemies she was chasing down. But she's much more boring now that you can't race around the map.

She's also even slower to ramp up now that she needs more mana for her spells (due to lack of that witchcraft passive).

On the other hand, the reason for the choice of red as the official color for fire trucks could be traced to the belief in the early years that red from the iron oxide had a very high durability which was why it was often the choice color for outbuildings and barns. During that era, red was also the most easily produced color.

Notes / issues / to-do:

I feel like there must be some place where scripts like these are developed but I could only find patchy resources and mostly out-of-date stuff. 

The main thing I'd like to add is a way to change the camera distance (perhaps just a toggle for far/normal by pressing KP_MULTIPLY again), but unfortunately in Reborn the command gives an error in the current client: `Convar 'dota_camera_distance' is cheat protected, change ignored.` so if anyone has a way around that let me know.

The INS key (not on numpad) will change to broadcaster view, but you have to manually edit it with the right broadcaster number so it's too awkward to use. To try to find the right number paste this into the console: `bind INS ""dota_spectator_hero_index 12"";` increasing 12 until you find the right one.

Would be nice if you didn't have to sometimes hit ESC after changing heroes (to display their items and pic)

I don't know if this whole thing is redundant and if casters have some magical resource somewhere, but I couldn't find it. It's partly based on [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/2adz93/valve_spectating_please_add_a_button_that/ciucwmx) script I found but heavily modified.

771,"They're meant to regenerate the forest but often it fails. Though even if they do, the sums don't work out. Victoria's cool temperate forests actually store half their carbon in the soil and ground in a thick layer of ground covering (humus, logs, etc) which gets added to over time (basically it's like a fridge, the carbon sticks around, unlike in tropical forests where the carbon and nutrients are quickly recycled). They burn the soil after logging together with all the parts of the forest which aren't the logs they haul away, e.g. underbrush, branches, etc. A large part of the wood is woodchipped, and turned into paper, which has an estimated average lifespan of 3 years before it's biodegrading or burnt and its carbon is back in the atmosphere too. So there's not huge amount being locked away in tables and cellos. Then if you want the forest to grow back to being an efficient carbon store you need about 1000 years (The trees can live to at least 600 years, and the forest needs time to establish.

834,"The term ""core game"" is not to differentiate ""true games"", but to separate markets. People seem to overthink it. Core games, as they're defined by marketing, are games that generally require 20+ minutes commitment for a gaming session, and/or have controls that are more complex than pointing and clicking. There's some borderline cases, but mostly it's a pretty clear division.

Many people play can't or don't want to spend more than 5 minutes per gaming session and don't care to master or remember controls. These are casual gamers.

Even the simplest WASD walking simulator is inaccessible to many casual players, and is therefore a core game. The Sims and Animal Crossing are core games. Smash Bros is a core game. Mario Kart is core. Anything that uses both a keyboard and a mouse is core. I'd guess that more-or-less all ""girl gamers"" here are core gamers. 

The other way to define ""core gaming"" is ""not mobile"". More core games are becoming available on mobile, but it's an easier and less subjective split to just say ""not mobile"".

Whichever way you want to split it, I'm pretty sure core gamers are still overwhelmingly male, but I couldn't find any recent studies last time I looked.

As for whether it discourages people from buying a game running at 30 fps, well, they can make up their own mind. That's the point. There's an open discussion on each 30 fps ""review"" where anyone can weigh in on the meaningfulness for the particular game. It wouldn't make sense for TB to the arbiter.

So, you're making speculative judgements about someone based on their race? That's what came across in your original message. Maybe your ""accusations"" about her upbringing are true, and maybe they're not. As you said, we don't know. So why bring it up and include it at all?

Pao's done actual actions which you can judge instead. You've listed them. You don't need to mention race.
