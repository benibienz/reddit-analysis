23,2016-08-12 12:30:36+00:00,self.TrueDoTA2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueDoTA2/comments/4xd9rr/why_bkb_on_dp_every_pro_game/,False,"In Ehome v DC (match id 2564666119), old chicken went for a BKB as the first major item after Euls (also had bottle, treads, and a casual hood) Other than the hood, this is pretty typical of every TI 6 match I've seen with a DP. I get the appeal of BKB, but it always seems like an overly expensive and very situational item for DP, but seems to get picked up early by pro players. I don't get why. 

Exorcism lasts 35 seconds and to make good use of it you have to stay alive for 35 seconds, not 10/9/8/7/6/5. If exorcism is active, then it often doesn't matter that much if you're stunned or whatever, just that you don't die. So being generally tanky is more important than full spell immunity. Not to mention DP already has a silence, which is like a poor man's 6-second BKB every 12 seconds (at level 4).

For a more specific example: In this game, if Old Chicken is stunned by Ogre or Mirana or a chrono then it's too late to pop BKB; he's dead. And he already bought a hood to help survive Skywrath/Mirana harassment. 

So he bought Euls at minute 17 and then it took until min 30 to finish BKB, which was used only twice for the remaining 7 minutes of the game. The first time was wasted/whiffed (enemies had already cleared off). The second time the enemy team ignored it and cut him down anyway just seconds before his team called GG. Though if they really wanted to the enemy team could have just waited out the BKB in safety. So 3975 gold for an item which effectively did nothing more than give 200 extra hp. BKB seems to be the first big item after Euls in every pro match, and I feel like most of the time the impact is not too different to what happened in Old Chicken's game.

I won't say another item would have salvaged the game for EHome, but anything else would have had more impact, and been better than having no useful item progression for 13 minutes: a solar crest (to tank tower damage, speed up rosh, to use offensively for extra exo damage, and help farm up your next item while exo is down, plus it gives mana), a blink dagger for chasing down (e.g. in one fight could have perhaps killed a fleeing ogre before going on timber), maybe a force staff, perhaps most of a shivas, or even a couple of smaller items to make DP tankier like drums and/or veil, or an aether lens (to silence Ogre before he gets too close), a gem, anything but BKB: things which would have some actual game impact, which BKB didn't and rarely does for DP.

Linkens might not have fit this game (and is more expensive, and I rarely buy it with DP), but by contrast it lets you get targeted by a stun, step away for a few seconds (or silence remaining threats), and then come back in before exo finishes. And while you're building it you get much needed mana + health regen so you can ditch the bottle.

Combine Linkens with a solar crest and then you can stand in the front line tanking tower between creep waves. And then when exo is down you can stand back and spam armor and linkens on your right-clicking core instead of just running away. (Again, probably wouldn't have helped much this game)

I'm not a huge fan of rushing Octarine (after Euls) unless you're doing ridiculously well, because getting stuck with a soul booster for a long stretch mid game doesn't help much either. So I'd rather get it as item #5 or #6.

Anyway, is BKB really that great of an item on DP? I'm kind of disappointed at how fixed the pro DP item progression is and feel like she'd be a lot stronger with better itemization. At least veil was something a little different (though that seems to have gone out of fashion again now). Maybe Old Chicken was anticipating a shotgun Mirana or other items on other enemies, but before that time could come he's already lost the game with ""maybe useful later"" item.

I'm hoping not to have to write down the recording volume or have to check that it's always the same between sessions. e.g. If I could play a sound at the start of each field recording session that was always the same dB, it would be easier enough to adjust the volume of each track so that they were the same.

E.g. I could play a sound on my phone, one meter away, at the start of each recording session, but then I'd have to make sure the volume on my phone's speaker was correct and if I got a new model of phone it would no longer be consistent. I feel like this is a problem that others must have solved before or is consistent volume between sessions not something anyone cares about?

I don't need anything hugely accurate, but I can't think of any simple noise/tone/chime generator that is reliable, cheap and consistent.

It would be useful, e.g. to compare audio samples, or to combine audio tracks without giving a loudness bias to either track.

You can just use one of your four Spirit Siphon charges.**

But what you can't do any more is simply catch up to them in a ground race. Without the Witchcraft passive, you're slow as mud. Or slow like every other boring hero. Now you need boots of speed and Euls just to get the movement speed you used to get from brown boots + maxxed passive\*\*\*. And you never reach the perma-racecar speeds of DP's 6.85 BoTs + Euls unless you also buy drums and yasha too**** (and like that's ever gonna be an optimal build).

Sure you don't always ward much as DP, but it was so much faster in 6.85. And sure you don't farm jungle much as DP, but that was so much faster to get around too (and cheaper mana-wise), and sure you could just TP to that fight but why bother when you can just run there from base? And sure you probably shouldn't run into 5 enemy heroes, harass them and run away again, but you could yesterday. It's just not the same. I miss racecar DP :(

----

*though the buffed atos is pretty amazing in 6.86, now that allies hit 100% of the time 40% of the time, and combine that with the extra range from aether lens it's pretty OP. And aether lens does work for crypt swarm's range too.

** **icevolvo pls fix** the status icon for Spirit Siphon. It goes backwards, and acts like it's counting down for the charge to time out when the icon should be ""filling up"" to show the next one is becoming available. Also enemy should get a status icon too, you know, as a courtesy, because DP is polite, unlike silencer.

However there is no source or instructions and I can't find anything else on it. It would be helpful if enemy units had less symmetrical icons, so their rotation was clearer on the minimap.

There are many guides to changing the size and color of minimap icons but not the shape. Is this possible and would it be a ""legal"" mod for online play?

numpad 1 - 5: radiant heroes

numpad 6 - 0: dire heroes

numpad / : player perspective mode (pp)

numpad * : hero chase mode (hc)

numpad . (del): free camera (press again to toggle back to previous mode)

pgup (not on numpad): select courier of selected hero's team (Works best in hero chase. Doesn't move camera)

backspace : clear chat (for spam)

numpad + and - : next hero and previous hero

It has some UX nicities that other scripts didn't. The main thing is it remembers whether you were last in hc or pp, so when you turn off free camera it jumps back to your last view. Also when you select a hero, if you're in free camera mode it also jumps back to pp or hc rather than doing nothing.
