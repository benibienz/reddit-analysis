When a comment is being read and the comment is also displayed on screen, **do not** write '\*reads comment\*' as the subtitle. That subtitle will block out the comment displayed to the viewer, so they can't read it themselves. It's unprofessional as well, *and* sometimes when Ethan/Hila read a comment out loud they say things slightly different from the comment's literal text, so it's necessary to make the distinction as well. Just write what they're saying, even if it's the exact same as the comment they're reading.

Also, if someone is talking multiple times in a row, don't write [Ethan] or Ethan: *each time*, only write [Ethan] or [Hila] when the person talking switches.

""Ryu literally loses to every camper you can think of"" so what? That doesn't mean ROB doesn't win the matchup and that certainly doesnt mean Ryu isn't high tier. 

I will give you that on Luigi and Pit but look at FOW's results and tell me Ness isn't relevant as a top tier. Ness got **top 5 at G3** and the two most recent 2GGTs and still got two 33rds and 25th via SS if that counts.

&gt;his aerials are not good at all

that's straight-up false, watch top level ROBs and then look me in the eye and say ROB's neutral air is bad. 

&gt;gyro and lasers is literally what carries him

First of all what does it matter what parts of his kit ""carry"" him? The results are there dude. That's not even true anyway -- like I said, watch high-level ROB play.

&gt;Lastly, Combos and edgeguarding doesn't make a character good because most of the roster can argue that they have the best edgeguarding.

uhh what? i'll tell you right now that the title of ""best edgeguarding"" is not in contention with most of the roster -- it's probably between Pikachu, MK, and Sheik. besides, the strength of other characters' edgeguards has no effect on how strong ROB's is. it's not amazing but it's still very good when aimed properly and when ROB's down-b spike and ledge traps are utilized properly as well.

174,"8bitman still plays ROB. besides, no 8bitman-based results were incorporated into that tier list -- the most prevalent player was Raffi-X. ROB still has a pretty good matchup spread against the majority of the cast -- although he has some borderline-unwinnable matchups against the top 10 (rosa, zss, mario) the rest are at least *doable* and he even has some decent matchups against relevant characters as well such as Ness, Luigi, Pit, and Ryu. on top of that, it's straight-up incorrect to call ROB's aerials bad. his nair is his best, better than forward air -- it autocancels from a shorthop, has great profit on hit with and without a gyro in hand, and is an amazing button in neutral. nair also has a surprisingly large disjoint, allowing it to outrange certain moves when timed and spaced correctly. additionally, it's a good landing option. not amazing though, and punishable at that. furthermore, rob's dair is one of the best and most consistently landable spikes in the game. good ROBs will regularly be spiking exploitable recoveries such as Ness' without even having to go offstage. even besides dair, ROB's no-commitment edgeguarding he can perform without even going offstage is one of his greatest strengths -- gyro and laser allow him to interfere with many recoveries and set up into one of his many ledge traps which can convert into an upsmash kill. ROB's projectiles, although counterable, are a very strong option in neutral that greatly assist certain matchups such as bowser, DK, diddy, luigi, and many more. ROB has decent frame data on his tilts, boasting a frame 3 jab and dtilt -- the latter can combo into a grab, which is one of the best things for ROB to do. dthrow uair and upthrow fair are both guaranteed at lower percents, and dthrow upair can kill extremely early at certain percents as well. at kill percent and last-hit situations, rob excels, abusing his keepaway projectiles until he can land one of his smashes, up and downsmash both being very skewed in terms of risk-reward, or his upthrow, which is an excellent stock cap killing most of the cast at around 140 with rage, earlier when used on the Smashville or T&amp;C platforms.",2016-07-19 01:03:32+00:00,d5hk9np,3.0,t1_d5hizvh,1912.0,smashbros

It has been the standard for most smash supermajors to have 2 streams for larger games, with some even having 3 (Genesis, GOML). Having **only 1** stream despite this being the most stacked and attended Smash 4 tournament ever is, to be blunt, inexcusable. The poor scheduling for Smash 4 competitors affected the viewing experience as well -- do I get a humanly healthy amount of sleep or do I see all the matches live as they happen? The poor scheduling and their choice to relegate Smash 4 to only one stream (Melee got 2!) caused many amazing and influential matches to either be lost forever or only partially immortalized in terrible phone quality.

Actually, I think our sub would look stupid as hell if the tears of joy emoji, the ok fingers emoji, the fire emoji, and the underlined 100 emoji were everywhere on the frontpage.

736,"1. I like how Smash is immersive and still takes a lot of thought despite being a fighting game. The way combos are made on your own is extremely fun and enjoyable. On top of that, the way kills have to be earned with strong moves instead of your opponents having a health bar is a unique and appealing mechanic.

2. An hour a day on weekdays and 2 to 4 hours on weekends, so about 11 hours a week. Wow.

3. ROB. I originally picked him up off of the fact that he's a robot in Smash, how cool is that? I've since come to love his variety of kill options, stellar recovery, and strong projectile game.

4. Smash 4. It has the most characters, the best graphics, the best online, and is the epitome of ""easy to learn, difficult to master."" It is the right balance between aggressive and passive imo.

5. I play frequently online, but I have yet to go to tournaments due to my age and the fact that I'm not yet good enough to justify a parent driving me to them.

&gt;#You're not allowed to talk about what one game did differently than another, what SSB4 did better than Melee, or why you prefer one game over the other, even in the comments. Apparently when you post a .gif of a match, it has to be in a text post. And when you do post a .gif, it can't be ""low quality"". They define ""low quality"" as ""Recorded with a camera/phone, or Low image quality of framerate"". Don't worry though! If you're too stingy with your money to shill out $200 on a capture card so you can post on Reddit, you can go to this subreddit to have somebody else record it for you, where a whopping ~26% of all requests get replies! Oh, and when you post art, it has to be in a text post. And when you post a snapshot, it has to be in a text post. (Also they don't really allow snapshots) And when you post a tweet, it has to be in a text post. Basically everything needs to be in a text post. I have no idea why they have a ""Submit a Link"" button. When I joined the subreddit a couple years ago when Smash 3DS came out, it was awesome! There were great gameplay montages, funny in-match happenings, glitchy physics, and funny jokes everywhere. But now is's just ""super srs, no item ofx only final destination"" highlights from Mew2King or Zer0's streams. When original content does get posted, 99% of the time it's a Melee match between Fox and Falco on the Yoshi's Story stage.

- The grand finals of a pre-release 3ds tournament were Bowser dittos. He was easy to use and had ""results"", not to mention that people over-estimated his buffs from Brawl and how important rage is

- Someone already mentioned this but Nairo's Zelda helped him beat Nietono when Japan came over at some point in January

- Yoshi feels really satisfying and good to play as, and yet again an example of over-estimating Brawl buffs

- Villager is very unwieldy with his bad grab and strange aerials/smashes, combine that with the minimal results he had at the time and you can see why they'd put him so low

- Olimar's Brawl nerfs were overestimated and he was an extremely unpopular character with no accolades

- Dedede got nerfed in 1.0.4 so I'm not sure how or why but i guess he was considered good back then and people decided his nerfs weren't enough to make him bad.

You're not allowed to talk about what one game did differently than another, what SSB4 did better than Melee, or why you prefer one game over the other, even in the comments.Apparently when you post a .gif of a match, it has to be in a text post. And when you do post a .gif, it can't be ""low quality"". They define ""low quality"" as ""Recorded with a camera/phone, or Low image quality of framerate"". Don't worry though! If you're too stingy with your money to shill out $200 on a capture card so you can post on Reddit, you can go to this subreddit to have somebody else record it for you, where a whopping ~26% of all requests get replies! Oh, and when you post art, it has to be in a text post. And when you post a snapshot, it has to be in a text post. (Also they don't really allow snapshots) And when you post a tweet, it has to be in a text post. Basically everything needs to be in a text post. I have no idea why they have a ""Submit a Link"" button. When I joined the subreddit a couple years ago when Smash 3DS came out, it was awesome! There were great gameplay montages, funny in-match happenings, glitchy physics, and funny jokes everywhere. But now is's just ""super srs, no item ofx only final destination"" highlights from Mew2King or Zer0's streams.

1030,"&gt;#Absolutely fucking toxic character to play against; either the devs made no effort to balance him for 1v1 play or they actively intended to destroy the meta as some sort of sick joke. His damage output on his aerials is completely incompatible with the frame data on them compared to other top/high tiers, and neutral B inputs (mostly the orange) stifle approaches; while this isn't inherently a problem, it's becoming more and more problematic when you have a character whose punishes are so absurdly reliable and powerful, if technically more difficult to perform than those of, say, Zero Suit Samus. Playing against the character after 60% (sometimes less) brings the match to revolve entirely around the possibility of any light hit leading into a guaranteed kill. It might be exciting for spectators but is massively overcentralizing in gameplay--think of Wario's Waft, but stuck on a better character. If he's not butchered in the final few balance patches (I doubt there are too many left, maybe one with the final DLC pack some time next year?) then I guarantee there will be debates on banning him before the end of 2016, and I may well be a proponent of doing so.",2015-11-18 21:34:25+00:00,cx4zaoa,2.0,t1_cx4y5e3,1651.0,smashcirclejerk

1196,"&gt;whenever you refer to any tournament attender you reffer to them as ""scrubs"" however when you talk about the online comunity you refer to them as ""high level players.""

Um, what? What I was trying to say is that calling a real life tournament more ""competitive"" was kinda silly because that implied that two scrubs playing at a local was more valid than a high-level wifi match. You're taking my words out of context and you're literally just incorrect if you're saying that I was making statements about wifi players and tournament players as a whole.

I wasn't saying anything about efficiency, all I said is that it takes around the same amount of time, which is true. It hardly takes a whole afternoon, and yet again you put words in my mouth. Also, how does using For Glory make it a ""case closed""? Sure you sometimes find scrubs on there but it's really not that bad if you search for a little while. Obviously not ideal but it works in a pinch.

I will admit that those claims about a ""lagless wifi experience"" are contradictory, but you're still completely ignoring my point which is the difference between a real-life match and a lagless wifi match is more negligible than the difference between modern-TV melee and CRT melee.

&gt;yes playing online at least in the sence that you are making it sound DOES equate to hours of 1v1s with the same person.

What is the sense in which I make it sound? Care to elaborate?

&gt;Lastly, you are not defending you're argument at all.

Yes I am. Don't know where you're getting that from.

&gt; You are just making quick little pokes at whoever replys to you, 

Well duh. who else am i supposed to reply to? random people not arguing with me?

&gt;and completly overlook completly valid points,

What? When did I do that?

&gt;and then respond with the same points you have been using sence your origional reply.

Of course I am. That's how arguing works. You defend your ideals using arguments you have that support them. Do you want more ""diversity""?


If there's one trend I'm noticing it's your lack of willingness to explain or prove what you're saying. Still don't know where you got that assumption that I've never been to a tournament. Still don't know why you said ""For starters, Money."" And in this comment, as I referenced above, you didn't say why you thought I wasn't defending my argument and when I overlooked valid points.

1197,"lmao where do i even begin with this comment

For some reason you have this belief that by defending my opinion I am inherently so closed-minded that I won't listen. Do you like, know how an argument works? Stop using false assumptions of my willingness to change my opinion as justification for your laziness.

Next up, to keep this string of random assumptions going you hit me with the ""fact of the matter is you have never been to a tournament"" which is completely coming from nowhere. besides no matter how true that is it doesn't make my argument any less valid

Finally this nice combo is finished with the ""Have fun online,"" which is really just trying too hard to be an epic conclusion.

Chars in F made no appearances whatsoever. The only exceptions I made were top-level, tournament-quality players who made the top 100 by dicking around with characters they play for fun, which were ignored entirely. The only two cases of this are Ryuga with Yoshi and Tweek with Lucas. If someone had 3 characters at ~30% each or 2 characters with ~50% each (Anthers' shows usage percentages for each character on the rankings) I counted each character as one appearance but I didn't count any very very uneven usage percentages or ones that were like 11 characters with 10% each (looking at you LordMix)

1528,"1. [](#Sm4shSheik) - It's Sheik. Duh.

2. [](#Sm4shZSSamus) - Equal or slightly worse matchup spread compared to Pikachu and better results. She's the equivalent of the Ice Climbers due to her touch-of-death combos and comeback potential.

3. [](#Sm4shPikachu) - Great matchups, plenty of results but the only notable Pikachu player besides ESAM is Nakat and even he hasn't been doing so hot lately.

4. [](#Sm4shRosalina) - Good results with Dabuz, Xaltis, and more, decent matchup spread, can control projectiles very well and Luma is just stupid.

5. [](#Sm4shFox) - Lots of potential. He has great movement, great kill setups, great recovery, and great smashes. His only real downside is that he can't kill off grab. Has plenty of results across many different regions with many different players, with the most notable one being Larry Lurr.

6. [](#Sm4shDiddy) - Diddy has no shortage of results or top players, with MVD, ZeRo, and Angel Cortes leading the charge. His simple ability to summon a banana coupled with his superb agility, throw combos, and smash attacks, along with the fact that he has a Side-B which acts as a command grab/powerful midair attack + recovery option is just stupid. Has some good matchups vs. top tiers, but is susceptible to edgeguards.

7. [](#Sm4shLuigi) - Luigi is dumb. He has Sheik's down throw, Fox's up throw, and no shortage of follow ups from either, including his tornado, which is a recovery option, edgeguarding tool, and kill move, not to mention two Rests, one of which is from his up-b and the other from his Side-B. However, he has ittle to no results at majors, and loses to Sheik as well as zoning-focused characters.

8. [](#Sm4shMario) / [](#Sm4shNess) / [](#Sm4shYoshi) - I can't decide between these three characters, they're all equally as good. Mario is just a generally solid character, boasting great combos, frame data, and in general gets a lot off grab. Still, he gets edgeguarded pretty hard. Yoshi is also strong, boasting Fox's up smash, Fox's up air, great frame data, and a decent enough matchup spread, as well as fucking armor on his double jump. I hate Yoshi with a burning passion, but I can't deny that he's a strong character. I would put Ness higher on this list, but he loses so hard to Rosalina that he's *technically* not solo main viable. Still, that's one of his only matchups that's too hard. Ness gets a lot off grab (including the best kill throw in the game and fair strings at low percents), (albeit unreliable) PK Fire setups, and in general puts on tons of damage and has great hitboxes. That being said, Ness has quite a few bad matchups, can get edgeguarded, and is very light.

9. [](#Sm4shSonic) - Sonic is obviously good. He has no trouble timing people out, is strong against basically any character that can't beat Spin Dash, and just recently got 2nd at Umebura, as well as getting some combos off grab. Still, Sonic is weak to zoning, has trouble taking the lead back if he loses it, has been neutered by almost every patch, and in general doesn't have too many high-level results besides Komorikiri's recent victory and 6WX at Paragon. 

[](#Sm4shPit) [](#Sm4shDarkPit) [](#Sm4shMaleVillager) [](#Sm4shWario) [](#Sm4shCaptainFalcon) [](#Sm4shOlimar) [](#Sm4shMetaKnight) [](#Sm4shROB) [](#Sm4shRyu) - These characters are good, but they are a cut below top-tier for varying reasons.

Falco is an interesting CPU. He is notorious for having the best matchup with Ganon, which is about 60-40 in Ganon's favor.

Besides the Ganon matchup, Falco does pretty solid against most of the cast, but he loses to Link, Luigi, and characters with quick ""combo breaker"" neutral aerials such as Yoshi, Mario, and Pikachu. Falco boasts a great recovery, great smash attacks, a down throw that starts combos, and a decent rapid-jab.",2015-08-25 23:53:49+00:00,cufomc8,1.0,t3_3ieecm,743.0,SmashCPU

So yes, people have plenty reason to dislike sonic both in and out of smash. *Fun little game, image search ""[ANY name] the hedgehog"".

2309,"I'm not going to lie, I was kind of a late bloomer when it came to Smash. As a little kid, I spent more time with sports than video games. I still played them, but I didn't care about them that much. It wasn't until I got older that I really cared about them, and even then my parents never bought me smash. It's not that they were scared away by the T rating -- they just didn't know it was a nintendo game, and my friends never talked about it enough for me to ask for it. My first exposure to Smash was Brawl at a friend's house, which I only even tried because my friends had started to get hype about the release of Smash 4. I tried a few characters, but the only one where I could do decently well button-mashing with the Wiimote was ROB. Besides, he's a robot! How cool is that? I got Smash 3DS and Wii U both on their respective release dates, and I've been playing ROB ever since. I'm now Silver III on Anthers', so I think I'm doing alright. I've still been figuring out a secondary, but Mario seems the most appealing right now.",2015-07-21 01:44:56+00:00,ctaeth3,2.0,t1_ct9kt93,51687.0,smashbros

Second and third times: On iFunny the most popular users have mod privileges (or at least that's what we can infer). One of them was caught liking some very questionable content so he freaked out and banned literally hundreds of people, including every last one who commented on his most recent post. In fact my third account only lasted for about an hour.

Fourth time: A certain user was causing so much trouble that anyone who posted something containing their username was banned. I was a victim.

2379,"Don't know how well this applies to smash but in Pokemon a gimmick is a strategy that can work effectively if you can pull it off but is weird, unorthodox, and gets countered by certain things. It usually takes multiple pokemon solely devoted to pull it off to work. For example, Belly Drum Snorlax in tandem with Pokemon that have the move Psych Up is a gimmick. Minimize Blissey is a gimmick. Liepard using the priority given by Prankster on the move Assist, and pulling up the move Dark Void with Assist is a gimmick. Something like Trick Room, although weird, is not a gimmick because it's still solid and consistently effective and takes very little setup to pull off.",2015-07-09 06:28:12+00:00,csx5pnd,1.0,t3_3cmzey,8448.0,smashbros

If anything, this tournament has convinced me that players should always come first (even though I'm a spectator). Three stocks are definitely the way to go, and Round Robin is certainly fun.
