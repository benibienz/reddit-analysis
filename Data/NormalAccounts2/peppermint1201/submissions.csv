I'll play smash with pretty much anyone. If I'm at a tournament, or at a setup, and you sit down with a controller, I don't care who you are.
But is smash just a game? No, it's a social experience. And that involves talking, and interacting, and sometimes eating together and making small talk, etc. And I like the people I hang out with to be people I like. That means who people see the world in a similar way, because my beliefs are important to me.
Another reason is that I'm a pretty argumentative person, and I want to avoid getting into a fight. If I don't like your views, I'm going to argue with you about it and then we just won't get any smash done.
We might like to think of ourselves as ""above"" vetting your social circle based on beliefs, but all research on the topic suggests people hang out with those who have similar beliefs to them, both because they seek out people they agree with in the first place and because peoples' views move closer to each others when they start spending time together. I'm just being transparent about that.
One more thing: I spend a lot of time talking and arguing with people who disagree with me. I do think it's important to maintain channels with those you disagree with, so that you can be exposed to different viewpoints. I just don't wanna sit on a couch for a few hours and play smash with them.

Ok so first, this is me ranting on an old main of mine who is commonly underused, but maybe after Croi won GF in the Canada Regional, maybe I can start defending DHD in a nice lovely rant. Hear me out and if you disagree, well then i love you still ok

So DHD is an underrated and an underused character in the game. I can understand why; there is very few attempts to pioneer this character. When there aren’t enough people trying, it’s harder for these underrated characters to get anywhere. Hear me out and listen to why I think DHD is NOT low tier, and has potential to be amongst the same levels of peach, greninja, DK, etc.(You’ll see what I mean at the end)

DHD has weaknesses, every character does, even sheik. However, the weaknesses DHD has is to such an extent it’s very clear and obvious:

DHD’s slow recovery that cannot be cancelled out of and has no hitbox

DHD’s kill options are limited, smash attacks are easy to escape, and most kill options kill later than average.

Ending Lag

Can die slightly more quicker

Needs to commit to his options.

They’re all good arguments… anyone can confirm you that every one of these weaknesses is lethal, and they cost DHD his games and his matchups.

Does that make DHD a bad character? No:
Projectiles can be used for set ups, walling, ledge camping, recovering, shield pressure, edge guarding, and more! Good combo game, can get more than 1 hit off of attacks, and several off of some of his projectiles. Faster than average, can run around the stage to reset his wall. Fast faller, can escape combo’s somewhat easier and smaller in size Kill confirms after grab and projectiles. Doesn’t need to approach because of projectiles Neutral B can be used as a get off me move.

I’d like to emphasize the 1st advantage I wrote for DHD. His projectiles. This is really a 6 in 1 advantage.

His set ups: People say Tink is good because he has kill and combo set ups from his bombs and boomerangs. That is true, but you know who else does? Duck Hunt! DownB can set up for aerials, spikes, more projectiles, upsmash, anything you can think of, just like the bomb. Side B can link into grabs when you practice the spacing and timing, the second attack of side B can link into all aerials. Neutral B can link into most things as well. When both get hit, you can also link a bair or uair to an early kill if sent far enough.

Walls: I think DHD is already known for his walls. His can can suck up attacks very well. his Down B doesn’t allow characters to rush in, especially if they don’t know the timing of each of the gunners. Side B can cover a lot of space, however it’s good to note when next to the opponent it won’t hit, you need to space yourself properly. DHD is also a good runner, so if the wall is infiltrated, easily run to the other side and start again!

Ledge Camping: Side B’s end lag can be cancelled by grabbing the ledge, it’s not easy to punish, and for slow heavy characters this tactic is very difficult to deal with.

Recovering: Yeah, DHD’s recovery is slow, but when you have Down B and the can helping keep the opponent back while you recovery is a big help.

Shield Pressure: DHD’s grab links to many combos, but they don’t damage the shield. Using Down B to bait the shield to get the grab is very important to DHD’s game. What if it the opponent understands this and is hesitant to take out his/her shield? That’s one less option to deal with.

Edge Guarding: Once the opponent is off the stage, DHD is at an advantage. Using down B at the egde, letting it fall under helps deal with recovering from below, while using the can and side B helps deal with recovering above. You have so many options you can use at once. Oh, and to add on, his Side Smash goes very far and covers a lot of space.

Some more things to add to DHD’s game: - His matchup against Sheik isn’t too bad, Though it isn’t in his favor, it’s definitely a good choice to pick if your main does have a worse matchup. -He has kill options from aerials and projectiles, and his upair is really good for killing, along with uptilt, his smash attacks, and occasionally nair/bair. -His dair is very quick, cancels itself, and can also be used to set up kills. -He has good matchups, it’s that NO ONE USES HIM.

Here’s a good match between Brood, considered the best DHD, and Rain, Japan’s best sheik. Notice how DHD falls out of Sheiks combos, edge guarded with the can to catch the 2 frame ledge grab, crazy walling and setups after projectiles. He uses down B to stop Sheiks needles and bouncing fish. He even uses the can to break sheik’s combos.

So why do I think he is among the same lines as greninja and peach and DK? because they are all good in the right hands. iStudy does amazing with greninja because he only focuses on him and does all he can to practice greninja's combos. DK and peach work the same way, you have to learn the character much more than others.

I truly think the only reason why DHD is considered low/bottom tier is because of the lack of results. He can be good. We just need our lord and savior.

EDIT: Just added lines to help organize.

Her invincibility frames on defensive options are completely incompatible with the frame data on them compared to other top/high tiers, and side b inputs (mostly the bullets) stifle approaches; while this isn't inherently a problem, it's becoming more and more problematic when you have a character whose punishes are so absurdly reliable and powerful, if technically more difficult to perform than those of, say, Zero Suit Samus. Playing against the character after 60% (sometimes less) brings the match to revolve entirely around the possibility of any light hit leading into a guaranteed Witch Time. It might be exciting for spectators but is massively overcentralizing in gameplay--think of Wario's Waft, but stuck on a better character. If she's not butchered in the final few balance patches (I doubt there are too many left, maybe one with the final DLC pack some time next year?) then I guarantee there will be debates on banning her before the end of 2016, and I may well be a proponent of doing so.

The game has been out for over a year. If you still don't understand that it's Rosalina and---&gt;And---&gt;ANNNND Luma, then it's your problem. 

Want to know what I do in the ditto? I REFUSE to touch the Rosalina in the ditto until Luma is gone. And I time it so that when Luma comes back, I punish the Luma because it can't move for half a second after it respawns.

There. A little secret for you bad kids. Because the majority of you are rotten and suck at the game and beg for nerfs instead of doing what I do: Getting better. 

Seriously, get better. Or.... I dunno.... maybe pick another character who can do..... something like......

1.) F-air planing you across any map (shiek)

2.) UP air boost kick to death (ZSS)

3.) Anything until true Shoryuken (Ryu)

4.) UP AIR UP AIR UP AIR UP B (Meta knight)


At the end of the day, bad kids will always be bad, and good kids will always be good. So I suppose my words are falling on deaf ears. I just hope this message reaches one of you bad kids so you stop and think ""Maybe it's not Rosalina, maybe it's because I just SUCK.""﻿

I then said to myself ""Ok, Lets pull some Lucas action on to this.""
I pick Lucas of course, And Jimmy picks ZSS like last time.
Guess what, Nothing changed.
PK Fire, Rope Snake, Paralyzed, B-Throwed, Rope Snaked the Ledge. I rolled on to the stage and paralyzed grabbed and then B-Throw Down Smashed.

I Immediately quit the game and threw the controller on my desk in a fit of rage, and played some Dark Souls to invade some unlucky souls.

This player will be patient, weaving in and out of the fight to land those heavy punishes, and will tank any incoming hits due to super armor.
He has been working on his reaction time in order to power shield any pesky projectile, in addition to throwing out the counter as another punishing option. His frame 1 jab is great to break up any strings you'll attempt. He'll be patient, and like a true boxer will study your patterns and habits. All it takes is a well placed down tilt and his KO punch is nearly guaranteed. It doesn't matter if his recovery is bad, first you have to launch him!
Trust me; Little Mac is going to put the hurt on us. I'm warning you ahead of time. Brace yourself.

But seeing recently the sheer amount of options Ryu has in Smash 4 is intense. The hitstun, priority, and setups that are able to be configured are unlike any other character in the game.
I believe it was Trela at Smash The Record and 2DJeff at MVG Frame Perfect which really opened my eyes to how crazy Ryu is.
Anyway, just wanted to see other people's opinions on this.
I personally think he's top 3 currently, and I had some videos/gifs to bolster my point but I can't seem to find them.
In other news, Puff is still complete fucking garbage but I'm gonna do whatever I can at Genesis 3 to see if she has one last fighting chance. I should just main Ryu or something.

I kid you not, Zelda in Smash 4 is literally broken. It's a joke. Despite being in low tier, she's devastating. I've used all the good characters in my book, and Zelda is still destructing. I've been using good characters like Fox and Ness, by the way. It's not that I am bad, I am a very skilled player. Let me list all of the flaws Zelda has.
She moves too fast - She rarely has any lag in any of her moves. Most of her abilities spew out of her like it's nothing. She shields and dodges WAY too fast to dodge all my attacks. It's lightning speed. When I try to dodge like that, it's too slow and I get hit.
Her abilities are overpowered - Din's Fire is like a Call of Duty gun. It'll keep shooting at you until you're dead. For example: When I'm Ness, and try to recover, guess what's coming my way? Yep, Din's Fire. Another one is Nayru's Love. Oh boy, don't get me started with this one. As I said previously, she is very fast. She can easily unleash this attack in an instant with barely any lag. When I try to approach, she dodges WAY too fast, as I said before, and after she dodges, guess what happens after? Nayru's Love. What a freaking joke. And here's the BIGGEST one of them all. Farore's Wind. I can't describe this in words. It's so... AHHGHGHGHGH! This is like one of the most broken specials she has. When you're right stacked up on her, she can use it, make you lift up in the air, and when she reappears, it's all over. You can't DI out of it. It's a freaking joke. Why could Sakurai do this?
Her hitboxes are a joke - She hits you even if you're not hit. She's hard to hit, as well, sometimes.
Now, let's recap: She's a broken character. Don't let her bad tier fool you, she is broken and people have yet to realize her potential. I'm so outraged right now, and I hope you can understand my situation. If you don't believe me, then I ask for you to go up against a Zelda player and see how much of a joke she really is.

His damage output on his aerials is completely incompatible with the frame data on them compared to other top/high tiers, and neutral B inputs (mostly the orange) stifle approaches; while this isn't inherently a problem, it's becoming more and more problematic when you have a character whose punishes are so absurdly reliable and powerful, if technically more difficult to perform than those of, say, Zero Suit Samus. Playing against the character after 60% (sometimes less) brings the match to revolve entirely around the possibility of any light hit leading into a guaranteed kill. It might be exciting for spectators but is massively overcentralizing in gameplay--think of Wario's Waft, but stuck on a better character. If he's not butchered in the final few balance patches (I doubt there are too many left, maybe one with the final DLC pack some time next year?) then I guarantee there will be debates on banning him before the end of 2016, and I may well be a proponent of doing so.",smashbroscopypasta,"""Ryu should be banned"" -Gandesa",https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbroscopypasta/comments/3qmpnf/ryu_should_be_banned_gandesa/

Sadly, it wasn't able to happen, and now that we're just days away, it's finally hitting me that I won't be there. I've never actually been upset about missing an event or occasion like I am right now.
This is going to be such a landmark event in the history of Project M. It's a burning beacon we've lit as a community after a nearly year of adversity from absolutely monumental juggernauts in the game industry, in the form of Nintendo and Twitch.
Project M had to climb such an insane mountain to get where it was in 2014. It was always just another fan project like Brawl-, Brawl+, Balanced Brawl and so many others. Just a fun little thing to try out on the side, but no big deal. No one ever paid it much attention early on. But the original group creating Project M had a vision, and they had the drive, the ambition and the dedication to make it happen. They worked harder, they met the opposition of all the Melee purists head on, who refused to consider a fan mod could ever be taken seriously. This community climbed a mountain, and finally after years of work it came to a Pinnacle at Apex 2014, where it was alongside every official Smash game, standing tall. It still faced clear opposition by many, but we didn't care from the top of the world. Apex, CEO, Big House 4, and a wealth of other incredible events dotted the rich history Project M was now truely beginning to paint.
Then, less than a year later, we made a new enemy in the form of Nintendo and Twitch. After Project M's most incredible year to date with 3.0, we were unceremoniously pushed aside. Tournaments dropped us, Apex perhaps sealed our fate, dropping it from the lineup after a promise of a main stage presence a year before and nearly every other major followed suit. The lights on Project M went out, the community fell to shambles, and the story ends.
Well. Not this time actually. Faced with such a situation, I firmly believe almost any community would be fractured beyond repair. But we were not content. We would not accept it. This community took a hold of the grassroots foundation and beliefs the Smash community was built upon and doubled down. Project M has been a 5 year direct effort by more than a hundred members of the community and an indirect effort by thousands if not tens or hundreds of thousands more around the world as players. It is in my mind, and probably will be, the greatest and most impressive collaborative effort the Smash community has and may ever be responsible for. We took every blow we were dealt and steeled ourselves. We continued to play, and we continued to love this game, with a future fueled on the dreams and passion of the people that play it.
Thus comes Paragon, an event going against the grain. They made sacrifices for our sake, and placed their faith in this community and boy did we ever show up to that performance. It wasn't enough for us to have a big major, no. We didn't just struggle to move upstream, we broke into a full run and made Paragon incredible.
It's been almost a year of fighting adversity from Nintendo, Twitch, major events, tournament organizers and even our community streamers and leaders themselves, in a grassroots scene. Despite every single one of those things, which even one of which should have crippled us beyond repair, we, together, as the Project M community, made Paragon the biggest tournament in Project M history, and crowdfunded more than $10,000 for a pot bonus through t-shirt sales. If you look down upon Project M, you simply just don't realize how tall we're standing. I was fighting back tears while writing this, and I can't say enough how proud I am of this community.
The Apex 2015 trailer gave each game a subtitle. ""The Original"", ""The Competitor"", ""The Intellectual"", ""The Newcomer"". In that same vein, I give one to not only this game we play, but the community at whole.

So yes, people have plenty reason to dislike sonic both in and out of smash.

Sonic has been nerfed with basically every balance patch ever released by Sakurai and his team, and yet you people never shut up. Sonic is not broken. Camping is part of the game -- the timer is a resource given to you by the game and if you do not utilize it you are not using the game to its fullest. Do not shit on other peoples' playstyles just because they bore you. This is a defensive game, and Sonic can perform effectively when played defensively. Let's grow up and accept this game for what it is.

Both characters are at 210%, a pretty normal percent to be at ever since Patch 6.9 was the last nail in the coffin, nerfing the few remaining moves with knockback above the power of a sour knee. As the clock begins to strike 2, Nairo manages to get Zero offstage. ZeRo, distracted by the snoring of the crowd, whiff's Sheik's recovery. Nairo has done it! He has ended ZeRo's 500-tournament winning streak! If only the crowd was awake -- they would erupt with cheer. Instead, they are motionless, like the crowd during the moment of silence for Max Ketchum, who killed himself a year ago after realizing Smash 4 had no future. As the snoring grows in volume, Nairo's euphoria turned to melancholy after he realizes the sad state Smash 4 is in. They clamored for nerfs. But not like this. Never like this. As Nairo mopes off the stage, he takes his trophy from Mr. Wizard's robot hands, Mr. Wizard's head cryogenically frozen atop the mechanical beast. In the background, ZeRo's commits seppuku, his corpse falling into the crowd, covering the sleeping spectators in bile and blood. Somewhere, InfernoOmni is crying. Crying for the commmunity.
