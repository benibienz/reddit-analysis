&gt;""Some Surprised by Obama's Choice for U.K. Ambassador
By David Kesmodel
Updated July 7, 2009 1:05 a.m. ET

&gt;CHICAGO -- President Barack Obama has raised some eyebrows with his decision to send as ambassador to the U.K. a little-known retired investment banker -- and top fund-raiser -- from his hometown who has little diplomatic experience.

&gt;The post at the Court of St. James's in London is one of the most prestigious in U.S. diplomatic circles. Though largely ceremonial and rarely controversial, it is a prominent position given the close relations between the U.S. and the U.K. In recent years, it has usually gone to political boosters of the president.

&gt;Still, the nomination of Louis B. Susman, whose confirmation hearing is scheduled for Tuesday, has rankled some watchdog groups and political commentators who say he was chosen chiefly because he raised money for Mr. Obama's campaign. ""Clearly his appointment has nothing to do with anything but money,"" said Craig Holman, a government-affairs lobbyist at watchdog group Public Citizen.

&gt;Mr. Susman declined to comment before confirmation, a customary practice for nominees. ""The president asked Mr. Susman to serve because he believes his strong background in public policy, diplomacy and business can help advance American interests,"" said White House spokesman Tommy Vietor.

&gt;Associates of the 71-year-old former banker and lawyer say Mr. Susman began educating himself for such a post years ago, when he brokered deals among feuding members of the Anheuser-Busch brewing dynasty and helped restore glory to baseball's St. Louis Cardinals as a team director. ""I can't think of anyone who would be better as ambassador to the U.K.,"" said former Anheuser-Busch Cos. executive Denny Long.

&gt;Like many of his predecessors, Mr. Susman has limited foreign-policy experience. He served on the State Department's Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy from 1988 to 1992, and is involved in the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, a think tank.

&gt;Only once in recent memory has the London Embassy -- with its splendid residence, Winfield House, in Regent's Park -- been awarded to anyone other than a political appointee. The exception was Raymond Seitz, an experienced career diplomat, who was appointed in the first Clinton administration.

&gt;Mr. Susman grew up in St. Louis as the son of a cloth-company owner, and was the first person in his family to attend college. He joined a prestigious St. Louis law firm and earned a reputation for his ability to attract clients and negotiate deals.

&gt;In 1975, August A. Busch III engineered a boardroom coup to replace his father, August A. ""Gussie"" Busch Jr., as chief executive of Anheuser, the biggest U.S. brewer. A furious Mr. Busch Jr., who was 76 and retained a big ownership stake, hired Mr. Susman to represent him in dealings with Anheuser.

&gt;Mr. Susman negotiated an accord that allowed the elder Mr. Busch to continue to preside over the St. Louis Cardinals, then owned by the beer maker. ""That could never have happened without Lou,"" said Adolphus Busch IV, a son of August A. Busch Jr., who died in 1989. Mr. Susman, he added, became his father's ""complete and total confidante"" during what were ""tough times in his life.""

&gt;Mr. Susman frequently defused tensions between the elder Mr. Busch and August A. Busch III, according to people close to the beer maker.

&gt;Mr. Susman himself ""never blew his cool, and there were times when that was easy to do,"" said Mr. Long, who was president of Anheuser's beer division during the period. ""He was very, very smooth.""

&gt;The lawyer also served as the executor of Mr. Busch's estate, which earned him significant fees. And he took an active role with the Cardinals, forming with Mr. Busch and Fred Kuhlmann a three-man executive committee that ran the team for more than a decade. The Cardinals reached the World Series three times during Mr. Susman's tenure, winning in 1982.

&gt;Mr. Susman had a hand in such key personnel moves as acquiring slugger Jack Clark before the 1985 season. He garnered his share of criticism from fans, too, for various moves, including the club's failure to re-sign relief pitching ace Bruce Sutter, who joined the Atlanta Braves.

&gt;Mr. Susman proved adept at brokering agreements among team officials about many issues, said Dal Maxvill, a former Cardinals general manager. ""People who had been in disagreement would walk out of the room, and all of a sudden they're best friends,"" he said. ""That's not an easy thing to do.""

&gt;While in St. Louis, Mr. Susman raised money for Democratic politicians including Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and former Congressmen Richard Gephardt and Thomas Eagleton of Missouri.

&gt;He moved to Chicago in 1989 to join Salomon Brothers Inc. -- later part of Citigroup Inc. -- as an investment banker overseeing corporate-finance activity in the Midwest. A tall man with a fondness for golf, wine and expensive cigars, Mr. Susman continued to help Democrats raise money. He was Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry's national finance chairman during his unsuccessful presidential bid in 2004, earning the nickname ""the vacuum cleaner"" for his money-raising prowess.

&gt;Mr. Susman helped fellow Chicagoan Mr. Obama by bundling contributions from donors for his presidential run. He bundled at least $100,000 for the race, and $300,000 for his inauguration celebration, according to Public Citizen.

&gt;Associates say Mr. Susman makes friends easily and is a quick study on many subjects. ""He doesn't have to wait until he gets every piece of available information to make a decision,"" said Fred Marcon, chairman of Underwriters Laboratories Inc., where Mr. Susman has been a trustee.

&gt;Mr. Susman retired as vice chairman of Citigroup Corporate and Investment Banking earlier this year. He owns an apartment on Chicago's Lake Shore Drive and keeps a vacation home on Nantucket, Mass., within walking distance of Mr. Kerry's Nantucket residence.""",2016-11-01 09:45:22+00:00,d9glz8d,1.0,t3_5ai54w,1200.0,The_Donald

&gt;The Houston Dynamo are in the process of identifying their next head coach. But according to a report out of Costa Rica, that is not stopping them from making moves during this summer transfer window.

&gt;Costa Rican defender Keyner Brown traveled to Houston on Saturday and is set to sign a deal with the Dynamo, according to a report from Nacion.com. Brown, 24, is currently on the books of Herediano in his native land's first division. The center back started in each of the 44 games he appeared in during the 2015-16 campaign, and scored two goals.

&gt;If the Dynamo were to sign Brown, he would join a defensive unit that includes the likes of DaMarcus Beasley, Raul Rodriguez and David Horst. Brown would also become the latest Costa Rican to sign in MLS, joining compatriots such as Christian Bolanos (Vancouver Whitecaps), Waylon Francis (Columbus Crew SC), Ronald Matarrita (New York City FC) and Johan Venegas (Montreal Impact).

&gt;Houston, who parted ways with coach Owen Coyle in late May, are currently in ninth place in the Western Conference with 18 points from 18 games.

IMPORTANT: BLACKOUT POLICY
MLS LIVE is available in the United States and Canada. The service is not available to fans living or traveling outside of the U.S. and Canada. All nationally televised matches are blacked out, but are available 48 hours after the match in the archives. Local broadcast blackouts are set by the clubs and their broadcast partners. Weekly match blackout details available on our TV Schedule or using the MLS LIVE schedule.  

So I don't think it's fair calling MLS Live a joke.

222,"Thanks for the reply. Sounds great what's going on over there. Really do hope it last and you guys achieve the MLS bid. The thing about soccer is that fans usually say and feel that they're members/supporters of the club rather than fans. So just in case the team doesn't do as well and the new sheen wears off, I'm hoping that there will be a different reaction than what you say, where supporters tend to stick around through thick and thin and continue going to the games.  

Couple of other questions:  
Are the fans going to the game generally university students since it is where the team plays? Or do you feel it is also nice mixture, even families attending the games? Since it is so cheap and near the campus, this could be so beneficial in that you will always get a stream of new fans as new students attend UoC. Old fans will stick around undoubtedly and continue to want to support while new fans get cultivated. Going forward, could be a thing for MLS to look for stadium sites near Universities and perhaps give students a discount on tickets.

If you're joining MLS in the future you start in the lower division.

I have lots of friends in the UK who want to watch the league but are frustrated with just the few games that they have available and the time that is shown. It is hard to support a team if you can't watch and follow them. With Live they could watch on demand and maybe develop a love for a team. They would jump on MLS Live so quick if it was available.

I would then make sure to add the condensed game version of each match on the official MLS youtube channels after 48 hrs. Those 4 minutes video highlights that they have now are not enough. If you have to add commercial and ads then do it. We are fighting an uphill battle with trying to get people to watch soccer, so get MLS to people who want to view it instead of making it more difficult.

385,"Does this take into account strength of opposition? E.g., an away win versus a top ranked team is worth more in the computation than a home win versus a lower ranked team with all else being equal such as margin of victory?  

Also maybe you could break it down to offensive and defensive efficiency ratings too. E.g. A goal(s) scored versus a great defensive team (low goals against average) is worth more than goals scored versus a poor defensive side. Likewise with a defensive rating that is computed based on the offensive rating of the teams' recent opponents. You can then use the team's separate offensive and defensive ratings for calculation of a final cumulative rating that also take into account other factors.

I think LAG social media team is probably one of the most accessible and friendly of all MLS clubs. They always respond back and try to be part of any conversation rather than try to be as quiet and limited as much as possible, I suppose to avoid a PR disaster such as this one. Someone at the keyboard was frustrated after that goal just like all of us and let their emotion quickly get the best of him/her. No need to demand for that person to be fired. Nor do I think it shows that the LAG don't care about their fans. Far from it. It was a mistake by one person in the heat of the moment and we all make them in our workplace sooner or later. Just a really tough and emotional night for everyone including myself. I feel bad for the supporters who went out there and I'm almost certain that the Galaxy will take care of them.

Fine, a team may not have the budget to advertise in that manner, but there is social media and apart from having someone run it, it is pretty cost effective. Likewise, LAG is also very active with their social media and create bits and pieces of video and content throughout the week. Some may not be on-field related like that prank StevieG and Keano pulled on Gio, but for the fan, these bits and pieces (1-2 minute of vid clips) go a long way in bonding with the team.

It will show that as time goes on and Fifa Rankings improve for a nation, their Youth regens also improve and eventually become world class players. Of course without any editing, this assumes that clubs for a particular nation as a whole will upgrade their facilities on their own if they have the finances. This would be feasible if year in and year out the clubs from that nation's top league are also successful in their respective confederation's Champions League to obtain the prize money.

For local games, UNIMAS games on Fridays and Espn, FOX1 on Sundays, just find a free vpn with mexican servers. Canandian servers might work too but I never tested it. Connect to a server and when you click on the game and you see that loading bar, immediately click the disconnect/kill button on your vpn to switch you back to your regular ISP. Never had any issues since I found out about this.  
  
And for those wondering why kill the vpn if it already loads, it's because free vpn and most vpn for that matter, are excruciatingly slow and you won't get the high resolution streams that come with faster speeds, hence the need to drop back to your regular ISP.

1187,"hey mate, unfortunately, the paid subscription service for MLS Live does not work in the UK. You can watch the fixtures on Sky Sports, list of upcoming televised fixtures in the link [SkySports Schedule](http://www.skysports.com/football/competitions/mls)  

Also, I've been doing easily accessible HD live streams on YT for the Reddit community lately to help promote MLS worldwide. Judging from the yt results, a good portion of my viewers are from the UK. Look for listings of my streams around KO time in match threads such as this one. Or if you want, private message me and early in the week I can give you a list of upcoming matches I plan to stream.
