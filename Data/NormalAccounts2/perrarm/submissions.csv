There are reports of peaceful protests in there. However, the only one that wasn't peaceful was the Benghazi attack, hence the extra emphasis on ""peaceful"".  
&amp;nbsp;  

The United States just suffered a horrible and publicized attack in Benghazi just 3 days prior and Huma is handing out praises? In this instance there shouldn't be any praises handed out for anything when looking at this report as a whole, of which Huma was forwarding along with her comment to Hillary.  
&amp;nbsp;  

What is strange is that Wikileaks cropped, ""I'm giving you credit for inspiring the 'peaceful' protests""  from Huma to Hillary and included it as an attachment in one of their email dumps that other people have found. I had to dig elsewhere to find this full pdf.     ",WikiLeaks,Please look at this PDF report relating to the Benghazi Attack.

There is also a [strength of schedule ranking](http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2016/01/07/2016-strength-schedule-rankings) to help determine relative difficulty.  

&amp;nbsp;  

For the Western Conference, my pick will be Houston Dynamo. They have added a lot of depth this year. With one year under his belt in MLS, I think Owen Coyle will really get the best out of his squad and Cubo Torres will make an impact. I am also impress with Minotas's play. They lost a lot of leads last season and I think they will do better to close out matches this season.  

&amp;nbsp;
  
For the Eastern Conference, I initially wanted to go with OCSC, but with their young core of players, its tough to determine how they will start out the season. They could be hot right out of the gate. According to the rankings, they do have an easier schedule compared to the others. Ultimately, I'm gonna go with NYCFC. I think the added defensive improvements will be huge for NYCFC. I'm in the defense wins matches camp. Also there will be huge pressure for the team and with Viera as the coach now and what seems like a rejuvenated Lampard, I think they may just squeak by.
