I said something like ""I'm temping today and don't know where to route this, but if you bear with me a moment I'll see what I can do.""   

Person on the other end of the phone said ""Oh you're a temp! I'm actually calling from the LaSalle Network! We're a staffing agency, you may have heard of us. Give me your information, I can get you a better job than this!""  

I said thanks and explained that I had a great relationship and history with the agency I was working with now (""where? who are you with??""), had a few interviews for permanent placements lined up for the end of the week (""where? what roles??""), and wasn't interested right now in shopping around (""you can work for two different staffing agencies, you know. just give me your contact info!""). She got really pushy. I took her email address and said I'd get in touch.  

The next day I was working the same receptionist temp job and *this person called again*, this time no pretense that she wanted to talk to anyone else at the firm.

Your skin is YOURS, what you choose to do with your body is YOURS, and has nothing to do with him!  

2) Any time a guy balks when you bring up your valid concerns about birth control should be taken as code for ""don't have sex with that guy."" You have to take care of yourself--protect yourself, follow your doctor's instructions, and don't proceed until you are 100% comfortable with the situation.

51,"I live in Little Village and have been here 4 years (in Chicago for 11). It's an odd place for me to live (single white 30 year old lady, no kids) but I like it ok. Rent prices are certainly right. 

It's a lot of families, a lot of kids, a lot of noise, and dirty but exuberant. All summer long you can hear people outside laughing and talking far into the night. A handful of weekends a year there are spontaneous ranchera dance parties in the streets until the wee hours of the morning. People with yards grow corn and keep chickens. Lots of great, cheap food but several of my favorite places have closed just in the past year. 26th Street on a warm Saturday afternoon feels like you're stepping into a completely different place and time.

There's more crime than I'd prefer but none of it affects me. Seems to keep well within the gangs. The guys across the street from me are drug dealers and will get customers  who sit outside and honk at 4am. There's never been any gun violence on my block, but there are frequently shouty fights that break out. On my block it's just that one building and those particular dudes there--everyone else is friendly, helpful, and well-adjusted. 

My only real complaint is the lack of green space. I'm around the corner from a boulevard which is better than nothing, but I don't have a lot of places to walk my dog and kids have nowhere to play that is safely away from car traffic. When Riot Fest came and shut down Douglas Park for 2 weeks (the only park) and ruined the nice grassy areas, it really harshed our groove.

Soak your feet for a while until they're soft, preferably while you're bathing yourself (just because it's nice), but a bucket with warm water and bath salts will do. 

Go to town on them with the pumice stone (do one foot while the other is still soaking, to maximize softening time). Buff off as much of the dead stuff as possible. If it hurts, STOP--you only want to buff off the dead skin, not your actual feet.

Dry them gently. Rub them all over with the salicylic acid product and let it sink in (wipe them off again if you used a scrub).

Rub them liberally with lotion, so that they're wet and gooshy. Put on the socks. (Do this before you go to bed at night so they can soak up the moisturizer.) 

Pumice regularly (once a week in the shower is what I do, your feet need to be wet and pliable) and put lotion on them every night. Regular maintenance is key.

Also, it's so gentle you don't even need to use water with it. You can just rub it into your skin and wipe it off with a slightly damp towel. This is super handy if you have an injury with a cast or stitches that you're not supposed to get wet. 

So rather than muck around with wipes (which look fine and I'm sure they're fine, I've just never used them myself), just get the container of the cleanser. You'll find a way to use it even if you don't like it for your face.",2015-07-18 03:50:11+00:00,ct7d8nr,1,t3_3dp1iq,5938,SkincareAddiction

There's such a huge gap of life experience between 17 and 26. Living with parents vs. being on your own, having a job or not, learning how to be self sufficient, etc, etc. Personally it would drive me bonkers trying to date someone who wasn't at a similar level as me personal-development-wise. 

So ask yourself why pursuing anything with somebody (a child) nearly a decade your junior is at all appealing to you. She's not even a fully formed person yet! She hasn't lived long enough to have a life that's compatible with your own! You probably don't really even have enough in common with her for a solid basis for friendship, let alone a romantic relationship.

What you need to do is forget about her and move on *by finding women your own age* to date. Go set yourself up a profile on okcupid/tinder and search for women no younger than 24. That should put you on a more even footing as far as life stages.

Once you actually start dating women close to your own age you'll wonder why you ever even wanted to date a kid so young at all.",2015-07-13 16:56:14+00:00,ct1vbu0,1,t3_3d56mc,656,AskReddit

I guarantee you you have met hordes of feminists in person and just not realized it. Not everyone goes around announcing what their beliefs are 24/7.

It's part of my core set of beliefs, but the only time anyone actually hears about it is when it's a relevant topic of discussion. Same with feminism. Same with **any** ideology.

The key in making gummies that actually taste like gummies (as opposed to jello jigglers) is to use a combo of sugars (including sorbitol) and special high-bloom gelatin. 

Here's a video on youtube that explains how to make (one very large) at home gummy candy. All you need is a mold in the shapes that you want, the proper ingredients, and boom you are good to get your gummy on.

And now I'm kind of pissed tbh that I didn't get to grow up with one. I regret every moment of my pre-kindle life. Books were ALWAYS the limiting factor for me with luggage. How am I supposed to go on vacation for a week, how could I possibly know how many books to bring?

Read through the texts again and think about anything that sounds fishy. Ignore all the hugs/napkins stuff, that's just noise. Read what the scammer is saying. 

-doesn't seem to care at all about the actual job that would be performed (most people would care about the number of photos, or time/date, etc)  

-wants to pay with a credit card, wants to pay NOW, doesn't bother negotiating price or hours or options    

-tells you they're getting surgery (why is this relevant? it's not relevant, they're trying to make you think that you need to HURRY HURRY HURRY so you won't think too hard about the stupid things they're asking you to do)   

-the crux of the scam comes where they ask to overpay you because their organizer can't accept payment blah blah blah. That's 100% bullshit. What these people do is ""overpay"" you, ask you to send them a cashier's check or money order or wire (i.e. CASH with no takebacks or protection) for the overage, and then they immediately withdraw their payment. So then you're left holding the bag, out all that extra cash.

Terrible grammar is usually a great clue, but more telling is getting straight into wanting to pay you for a job without even asking you questions about it or see any of your prior work or haggle on the price.

A lot of times it'll be something hilariously obvious like ""my name is Johnson Melissa"" where they don't realize the name they picked is following a Lastname, Firstname convention, so it sounds really wrong.

All that, coupled with a phone number that will likely be coming from an area code that's out of state or out of country, is a pretty good indication that somethings not on the up and up.
