Is it possible for me to make an account here on my windows desktop, purchase the game, and then open Steam on her mac when I'm home and run the game from there? Does it work like that? Again, I don't have a Steam account yet so can do whatever I need to do from scratch.

One of those situations where my whole chin felt lumpy and enflamed and sensitive to touch. Just totally miserable.

Usually my AM routine is just cleanser (Cetaphil) and a bit of CeraVe lotion, but today I added an AM Stridex wipe as well, focusing especially on the chin area. That night before bed I wiped it down again with Stridex and put a thick coating of Aztec clay mask over my whole chin to seep with.

Friday morning everything looked so much better already. Angry chin had resolved itself down to specific zit regions. I cleansed, lanced (made sure everything was sterile, of course), stridexed the chin, and put hydrocolloid spots over each individual zit for the day. That night, stridexed again and did just a bit of spot treatment with Aztec clay.

Saturday (yesterday) when I woke up, my chin seemed pretty cleared up but was also dry and flaky. It had been through a lot--that's to be expected. Did a simple cleanse and just a bit of CeraVe. Last night, I was back to my regular routine: Cetaphil, stridex, CeraVe. But I really heaped that moisturizer on my chin, time to let it repair.

And now, this morning, my chin is *completely* back to normal. It's like the zitsplosion on Thursday never happened. So that's three days I spent dealing with the fallout; before I discovered SCA and got good products, those zits and I would have been together for weeks. *Weeks.* But now just a couple days later and I have my chin back. Yaaaaay!

I *did* do an Aztec clay mask yesterday after all, but this is above and beyond any results I've had previously.

Feeling pretty good about myself I started to brush my teeth and suddenly got a flashback from the previous night. I had been brushing my teeth and the toothbrush slipped and I splattered toothpastey spit all over my mirror. Being lazy and tired at the time, I just swiped it all off with my hand and figured I'd give the mirror a proper cleaning in the morning.

And it hit me. That's why my skin looked so good. Because I was looking at myself in a mirror covered with a subtle hazy sheen of toothpaste spit. Like an IRL photoshop gaussian blur.
