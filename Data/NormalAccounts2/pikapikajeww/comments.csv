1,"Oh my god. I have a kind of similar story.

I was really drunk one night when i was in my early teens and stumbled upon this cute little frog. I walked around with it for an hour or so, it was my little buddy. My boyfriend told me I needed to let it go and drunk me saw a pond about 15-20 feet away so, without a second thought, I just hurled it into it. We both looked at each other in horror and I just repeated drunkenly ""I don't know why I did that..."" I still think about that poor little frog.  :(",2016-11-03 19:51:02+00:00,d9kfwcb,2.0,t1_d9jvg6j,25155.0,AskReddit

4,"Oh god. So, I'm a waitress and my name is Phoebe. Customers often make jokes about the show Friends when I introduce myself to them. 
This night was like any other. I introduced myself to a older couple and the woman said, ""Your name is Phoebe? Can we be FRIENDS? Haha, get it?"". For some god awful reason, i tried to make a joke about the smelly cat song but what came out was ""Only if you let me see your smelly cat."" Once I realized what I had said, we all stared at each other with wide eyes. They weren't amused, and needless to say they didn't tip me.

One night we hung out as usual, but after i went home he then ignored me in every way possible.  He didnt even give me any sort of closure whatsoever until a year later when he contacted me for the first time and apologized. It was rough for awhile, but it gets better. If they want to go the most heartless route of ending things, they weren't even worth your time in the first place.
