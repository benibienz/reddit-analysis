13,"Look, I agree with you that Trump used rhetoric of that nature. Personally, I believe that his election is a disaster. It's important to understand why 47% of voters voted for Trump though. Some of them were certainly racists, xenophobes, etc. I'd be careful of extending that to the majority.

My aunt and uncle both voted for Trump, and I wouldn't call them racist, xenophobic, or homophobic. In fact, they're both immigrated from India just a decade ago. When I asked my uncle why he was voting for Trump he acknowledged that Trump's rhetoric deeply disturbed him, he couldn't afford his insurance premiums increasing anymore nor, as a small business owner, did he want the democrats, a party he perceives as anti-business, to be elected.

Take a look at [this Slate article on exit polls](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/debunking_myths_about_trump_voters_with_exit_polls.html). For 40% of voters, the deciding factor in their vote was bringing change to Washington. Now, we can argue whether Trump was the right way to bring about that change, but we can agree on the fact that our government has been paralyzed for years now, and that's intensely frustrating.

45% of Trump's voters were troubled by his comments towards women. Would you label all of these voters sexists? 8% of blacks voted for Trump. Would you call them racists? More than half of those who voted for Trump are opposed to deporting those illegals who already reside here. Would you call them xenophobes?

The point is that on Tuesday a lot of normal people who aren't especially sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, etc. voted for Trump because they wanted to change the system. I dont think Trump is the solution to the system, but I can see his appeal. I can see why people think the system needs to change, and I can certainly see why they didn't think Clinton could provide that change. 

There are many reasonable people in this country who, if they didn't support Trump, held their noses and voted for him. You probably know some. I have some in my own family, and I'm basically a socialist. Am I saddened and dismayed by their decision? Yeah, no kidding. That being said, I wouldn't label them racist, sexist, homophobic, or xenophobic, and I certainly don't think they deserve anyone's contempt. I still look up to them. You might too, if you knew them.

Obama said yesterday that all Americans are on the same team. That's a sentiment we all seem to have forgotten, but it's true (aside from the legitimate extremists on both sides). America is very divided right now. If each half holds the other in contempt, then we're doomed. Both sides need to try and understand each other at this point, and that starts with us.

You dont need to do it now. Like I said, we all need to cool off and a lot of us (myself included) are very emotional right now. Give a week or two. Maybe even a months. But please, try to understand those who voted against you and their reasons for doing so.

130,"Hi! I'm back with more questions!

Basically, I'm having an ungodly amount of trouble trying to initialize static variables. Here's the class that's causing all the troubles, `Triangle`(`.h`)

    #include ""Drawable.h""
    
    class Triangle : Drawable {
    public:
        Triangle();
        ~Triangle();
    
        static shaderUtils::shader v = shaderUtils::shader(GL_VERTEX_SHADER, ""../../res/basic.vx"");
    
        shaderUtils::shaderProgram getShaderProgram();
        GLint getVAO();
        void getData();
        void getVBO();
        void getEBO();
    
    };

And basically what I want to accomplish is initializing v to be a valid shader. So, trying to compile that class gives me the following error

    error: in-class initialization of static data member ‘const shaderUtils::shader Triangle::v’ of non-literal type
     static const shaderUtils::shader v = shaderUtils::shader(GL_VERTEX_SHADER, ""../../res/basic.vx"");

So naturally, my instinct was to change stuff around till it compiled. I then tried to initialize it as 

    static shaderUtils::shader v(GL_VERTEX_SHADER, ""../../res/basic.vx"");

And got a totally different error (which really threw me off since I thought those two initialization expressions were equivalent)

    expected identifier before numeric constant
     static shaderUtils::shader v(GL_VERTEX_SHADER, ""../../res/basic.vx"");

So then I tried to just declare v with the line

    static shaderUtils::shader v;

And initializing it in Triangle.cpp like

    shaderUtils::shader Triangle::v = shaderUtils::shader(GL_VERTEX_SHADER, ""../../res/basic.vx"");

And that causes my program to insta-segfault! I also get a segfault by doing the `Triangle::v = shader(args)` method

So when I try initializing v like 

    Triangle::v = shaderUtils::shader(GL_VERTEX_SHADER, ""../../res/basic.vx"");

C++ complains that `‘v’ in ‘class Triangle’ does not name a type`

And if I try 

    Triangle::v (GL_VERTEX_SHADER, ""../../res/basic.vx"");

Then C++ instead complains `error: expected constructor, destructor, or type conversion before ‘(’ token
 Triangle::v(GL_VERTEX_SHADER, ""../../res/basic.vx"");`

I've tried googling around, looking at StackOverflow answers, and I just can't seem to find a way to initialize `v` correctly. Could you explain to me why this is happening and how to properly initialize the object?

139,"Hey! I've since implemented the factory method of instantiation- however I'm having some issues

The problem is that when instantiate a `Fruit` object like `Fruit f = make_fruit(""apple"");`

Where `make_fruit` is a factory function defined like so

    Fruit make_fruit(std::string type) {
        if (!type.compare(""apple"")) return apple();
        else ... // Handle other cases
    }

 and then try to call `Fruit.do(3);`, it actually calls the `do` function defined in `Fruit` rather than the `do` fuction defined in `apple`. Since `f` is of type `apple`, a subclass of `Fruit`, shouldn't C++ call the most-specific version of `do`, the one defined in `Apple`?

In my opinion, the korra spirits (Like the flying bunnies) were just drawn in a style that doesn't fit with the art of the show at all. 

Really, Korra is drawn in a pretty realistic style, and most of the spirits don't have shading and look like they belong on a tv show for four year olds. The difference is especially jarring whenever the spirits appear in the ""real"" world. It's hard to imagine any of the new spirits (again, with a few exceptions) in the original series.

And I would contest your point about creativity, I don't think that quantity=creativity. Most of the korra spirits were generic objects with eyes and/or legs slapped onto them. That, and evil spirits were literally just purplish blobs.

That book was fucking terrible. It completely ruined Revan as a character. In the games, Revan's (and Malak's) transition from Republic crusader to Sith Lord was mysterious and compelling. We knew they couldn't abide by the Jedi's inaction and seeming nonchalance concerning the Mandolorian atrocities, were forced to action because they couldn't stand by and watch beings die. When they return as Sith, one has to wonder why they changed so much, and whether a Republic abandoned by its heroes is worth defending at all. 

After all, Revan and Malak must have had some compelling reason to wage a war against the Republic they once protected, against the Jedi who were once their friends. They must have had an ideal, some vision of a better galaxy to turn against everything they once knew.

Revan's motivations were an enigma, and the character had moral complexity.

""Revan"" was like ""lol fuck that Revan turned evil because he got mind controlled by an immortal sith emperor""

Judging from his tweets over the past month, he basically watches streamers, puts together a changelog, and then sends it to Nicalis who then patch it in immediately (like with Azazel). 

I get that he has a newborn but come on, this is his fucking job. I don't think this sub would have faulted Ed for simply taking a month or two off after Afterbirth, leaving Nicalis to patch crashes, instead of giving us these half-assed patches all the time.

Ed is a cool guy, but he has this holier-than-thou attitude, which is frustrating since he tends to see complaints about legitimate issues (like Angel Rooms) as whining. For a game he created, his knowledge of it isn't great either (he didn't know Book of Belial gave garunteed Devil Deals- at this point I wouldn't be surprised to learn the fucking chests on the dark room are a bug).

There's a technique called the ""Storm Bomb"" or something similar, where storms zips out of fountain and TP's back at the same time- the idea is to ball as far as you can, hopefully assassinating someone on the back line, before TPing back to high ground immediately. If you're farmed enough this can devastate your enemy, as you do a shit ton of dmg on arrival. However it does require skill, as you need to judge where the enemy will be, and you can deal several hundred dmg if you do it right, enough to kill heroes like Skywrath Mage

It's certainly a useful technique, but it is situational. The waste of mana you describe is a problem, but mostly because if you're only getting a couple hundred damage out of your hero pool then you're doing it wrong.

I've started a game of KOTOR, and I'm noticing some pretty gamebreaking bugs when I have the expanded content mod install. So far I've noticed that with EC,

1. Some interaction points (such as terminals) will just refuse to work, even after rebooting the game (ex: the medical bay interaction terminal, the first one you access on Peragus)

2. When attempting to save or load, the bar will freeze at 10% indefinitely. For me this happened after completing/skipping the prologue, when the game was attempting to load Peragus.

984,"Thank you!

However this is a pretty beautiful feature that I didn't know about before, and I'll definitely try to use it in other C++ projects!

One question- why did you get rid of my declaring `optimized_verts` as `new std::vector&lt;GLfloat&gt;()`? I actually didn't think there was a difference in the two declarations.

EDIT: I just tried adding `-Wall -Wextra` to my compiler options and it looks like my IDE (CLion) just prints out the warnings for a split second and then moves to another view with no option to reset to the warning output. Is there a way I can make the `-Wall -Wextra` generate legitimate errors so that I can read the messages? ",2015-06-26 21:41:08+00:00,csjvsip,2.0,t1_csj8zhg,42399.0,cpp

* What's the big deal with const references over (const) pointers? I've seen the ""use const references for inputs"" before, but I don't really understand why you would do this as opposed to just using a const pointer
* Why would I pass a vector / list of things around by value? I thought that involved a lot of unnecessary overhead.

Your iterator code looks a bit scary, so I didn't implement it in [my updated version](https://gist.github.com/pipsqueaker/aba18e4e8a42226b4bab). I'll definitely take a look and try to understand it though.

I appreciate the advice and, as you probably shouldn't be surprised to hear.

* Why shouldn't I pass ""arrays"" to my functions? From what I've read a c-style array is just a pointer to its first element, which is what I want here- isn't it better to make it clear that I expect some sort of contiguous list of values by declaring my argument as an array rather than a pointer, with the same effect?
* You say that I'm passing length as a const pointer. However, doesn't using `const int length` just pass in a plain old integer? Why would I need to use a reference there? My confusion on this is exacerbated by the fact that I don't really know why you would ever use a reference over a pointer or vice versa, they seem like two ways to achieve the same thing.
* What's the difference between an ""owning raw pointer"" and a plain old pointer? Why can I use (raw?) pointers elsewhere in my program, yet as soon as I try to delete it it becomes a ""bad"" kind of pointer?
* You say I'm leaking optimized_verts, but all I can see that I did was initialize it as a vector and append elements to it. What do you mean?

Also, do you know of any good *modern* c++ tutorials? I used the [cplusplus tutorials](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/) just to teach myself the syntax, but from what I see here I get the impression that those teach me stuff I shouldn't be doing (concerning pointers and arrays, anyways) ",2015-06-26 21:21:34+00:00,csjv3p8,2.0,t1_csj47q8,58311.0,cpp
