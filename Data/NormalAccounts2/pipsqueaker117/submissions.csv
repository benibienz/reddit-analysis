I have a Raphael canvas in which I've drawn a timeline. The timeline is long, so it extends past the edge of the canvas. I would like the canvas to have a horizontal scrollbar on it so that the user can move sideways. 

I know that the way to do this is to set `overflow-x: scroll`

within the css. However, using jQuery to set the `overflow-x` of the svg div which Raphael creates does nothing. Attempting to style the svg's parent, `canvas` also does nothing. I have confirmed using my browser that these properties are, in fact, being set, they just dont seem to affect anything. Could help me diagnose my problem.

The code is available at [my github](https://github.com/pipsqueaker/CryptoVis), and you should be able to run the website just by opening index.html. I style the `svg` div on line 38 of index.html, and all other styling is in the CSS

I was just wondering if anyone could give me some advice on this team. I tried to build it around Talonflame + Serperior offensively, and Skarmory + Quagsire defensively. I'd say it works well, but I haven't been doing too well with it (then again, I'm no battling pro either).

The idea of the team is to try and force out anything that could give serperior trouble, kill it, then let le balanced grass snek spam leaf storm to victory. 

There are some pokemon I'm having trouble with though. Latios especially, as it can just come in on Serperior and kill it before it has time to build up boosts. Weavile is also a big issue, as it can easily outspeed Serperior to KO with icicle smash.

I could swap out Azumarill with a Shuckle (I haven't tested out Azumarill with this team at all, but I've been swapping that slot a lot to try and find a good defensive pokemon), but then I'd have a shuckle on my team... I suppose it would give me a slot to set up rocks though.

Unfortunately, when you compile the example above, only the first vertex has the correct color- the rest seem to be black, and the fade effect is probably interpolation kicking in.

Obviously the most efficient way to draw these objects is to make collections of `Apples` and `Oranges` and, before drawing each collection, do something like

     glBindBuffer(GL_VERTEX_BUFFER, apple_vbo);
     glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, apple_texture);

In general, I prefer being explicit with my code, even at the cost of performance. What I'd rather just do instead is, in the `draw` method of `Apple` and `Orange` just write

I'm moving further into the abstraction phase now, and I've basically shoved all the vao, vbo, etc. stuff into the `Triangle::initStaticVars` method, which looks like this right now

    GLuint Triangle::vao;

    GLint Triangle::posAttrib;

    shaderUtils::shader Triangle::v, Triangle::f;

        GLint posAttrib = glGetAttribLocation(Triangle::p.programRef, ""position"");
        glEnableVertexAttribArray(Triangle::posAttrib);
        glVertexAttribPointer(Triangle::posAttrib, 2, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 0, 0);
    }
    void Triangle::draw() {
        glDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLES, 0, 3);
    }

Which should contain all the information and variables required to draw a triangle. I basically copied all of this out of the setup to draw a triangle I was doing in `main.cpp` and just moved it into the `Triangle` abstraction.

So when I removed all that setup stuff from `main.cpp` and tried to run the program by initializing a `Triangle` and using its `draw` method, I just got a black screen. So I put all those lines of code back above my `Triangle` initialization, and it worked! `main.cpp` wasn't even just drawing a separate triangle either- it was actually drawing the triangle object I initialized! I could change around the data in `Triangle::vertices`, and see that reflected on the screen.

I found that I could delete all the redundant code in `main.cpp` except for the following five lines

    shaderUtils::shader vertexShader(GL_VERTEX_SHADER, ""../../res/basic.vx"");
    shaderUtils::shader fragmentShader(GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER, ""../../res/basic.fx"");

    shaderUtils::shaderProgram prog({vertexShader, fragmentShader});

    prog.activate();
    prog.uniform_list[""a""]-&gt;set1f(1.0f);

Which initialize shaders and set the opacity attribute of the resultant shaderProgram to 1. This especially confused me, because `Triangle` actually has its own `shader`s and `shaderProgram` which it activates and tries to use to draw its data.

What I found that was that, no matter how I tried to force the triangle class to use its own `shaderProgram`, the triangle was always drawn using the shaderProgram in `main.cpp`. No matter where and how many times I tell `Triangle` to activate it's own shaderProgram, if I change the opacity of the `shaderProgram` in `main.cpp` then that's what's reflected on the screen. In the `Triangle::draw`, which is what I call from the draw loop, I can even put in the following lines before the call to `glDrawArrays`

    Triangle::p.activate();
    Triangle::p.uniform_list[""a""]-&gt;set1f(.5f);
    glDrawArrays(args);

and the program stubbornly refuses to care. Apparently it has determined that the `shaderProgram` in main.cpp is what it will use to draw the `Triangle`, no matter how I try to stop it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The second issue is a lot simpler. The code to initialize the vertex array object in `Triangle.cpp` looks like, and works

    GLint posAttrib = glGetAttribLocation(Triangle::p.programRef, ""position"");
    glEnableVertexAttribArray(Triangle::posAttrib);
    glVertexAttribPointer(Triangle::posAttrib, 2, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 0, 0);

However, I have a static variable `posAttrib` in the `Triangle` class- the way the above code is doing it, creating and assigning to a local variable, is a remnant of being pasted in from `main.cpp`.

If I change the first line to `Triangle::posAttrib = glGetAttribLocation(Triangle::p.programRef, ""position"");` to try and assign to the static variable instead, I just get a black screen when I run.

Come to think of it, I imagine the first block only works because of lucky default values, since I'm clearly assigning to a local variable in my first line and accessing `Triangle::posAttrib` with my next two.

Basically, I'm having an ungodly amount of trouble trying to initialize static variables. Here's the class that's causing all the troubles, `Triangle`(`.h`)

    #include ""Drawable.h""
    
    class Triangle : Drawable {
    public:
        Triangle();
        ~Triangle();
    
        static shaderUtils::shader v = shaderUtils::shader(GL_VERTEX_SHADER, ""../../res/basic.vx"");
    
        shaderUtils::shaderProgram getShaderProgram();
        GLint getVAO();
        void getData();
        void getVBO();
        void getEBO();
    
    };

And basically what I want to accomplish is initializing v to be a valid shader. So, trying to compile that class gives me the following error

    error: in-class initialization of static data member ‘const shaderUtils::shader Triangle::v’ of non-literal type
     static const shaderUtils::shader v = shaderUtils::shader(GL_VERTEX_SHADER, ""../../res/basic.vx"");

So naturally, my instinct was to change stuff around till it compiled. I then tried to initialize it as 

    static shaderUtils::shader v(GL_VERTEX_SHADER, ""../../res/basic.vx"");

And got a totally different error (which really threw me off since I thought those two initialization expressions were equivalent)

    expected identifier before numeric constant
     static shaderUtils::shader v(GL_VERTEX_SHADER, ""../../res/basic.vx"");

So then I tried to just declare v with the line

    static shaderUtils::shader v;

And initializing it in Triangle.cpp like

    shaderUtils::shader Triangle::v = shaderUtils::shader(GL_VERTEX_SHADER, ""../../res/basic.vx"");

And that causes my program to insta-segfault! I also get a segfault by doing the `Triangle::v = shader(args)` method

So when I try initializing v like 

    Triangle::v = shaderUtils::shader(GL_VERTEX_SHADER, ""../../res/basic.vx"");

C++ complains that `‘v’ in ‘class Triangle’ does not name a type`

And if I try 

    Triangle::v (GL_VERTEX_SHADER, ""../../res/basic.vx"");

Then C++ instead complains `error: expected constructor, destructor, or type conversion before ‘(’ token
 Triangle::v(GL_VERTEX_SHADER, ""../../res/basic.vx"");`

I've tried googling around, looking at StackOverflow answers, and I just can't seem to find a way to initialize `v` correctly. Could you explain to me why this is happening and how to properly initialize the object?

I'm trying to construct an unordered list which maps `std::string`s to `uniform` classes, where I define the uniform class. I'm doing this by saying

    #include ""uniform.h""
    #include &lt;unordered_map&gt;
    namespace shaderUtils {
        class shaderProgram {
            std::unordered_map &lt;std::string, uniform&gt; uniform_list;

And uniform is defined in shader.h as

    namespace shaderUtils {
        class uniform {
            // stuff
        };
    }

However, when I try to compile the code, I get the following error

    error: ‘uniform’ was not declared in this scope
         std::unordered_map &lt;std::string, uniform&gt; uniform_list;

But if I try declaring the unordered list as `std::unordered_map &lt;std::string, shaderUtils::uniform&gt; uniform_list;`

I instead get the error

here's the contents of the file with the reader

    #include ""SDL2/SDL.h""
    #include ""SDL2/SDL_opengl.h""

    #include &lt;string&gt;
    #include &lt;fstream&gt;

    namespace shaders {

        const GLchar* read_shader_source(const std::string shaderpath) {

            std::string contents((std::istreambuf_iterator&lt;char&gt;(in)),
                                 std::istreambuf_iterator&lt;char&gt;());

            return contents.c_str();
        }
    }

And here's the source file that it's reading

    #version 150 core
    in vec2 position;
    void main() {
       gl_Position = vec4(position, 0.0, 1.0);
    }

So, in my Hello Triangle program, I load the source file as follows

    const GLchar* vertexSource = shaders::read_shader_source(""../../res/basic.vx"");

I could also manually enter the shader source for the code as follows

    const GLchar* vertex_o =
            ""#version 150 core\n""
            ""in vec2 position;\n""
            ""void main() {\n""
            ""   gl_Position = vec4(position, 0.0, 1.0);\n""
            ""}"";

However, trying to pass `&amp;vertexSource` as an argument to `glShaderSource` by doing `glShaderSource(vertexShader, 1, &amp;vertexSource, NULL);` results in a black screen, whereas passing `&amp;vertex_o` gives me a functional vertex shader and a triangle drawn to the screen.

Now I'm REALLY confused about this. I've tried comparing just about every attribute I can think of- I've printed the results of `typeid(vertexSource) == typeid(vertex_o)`, `typeid(*vertexSource) == typeid(*vertex_o)`, `*vertexSource == *vertex_o`, `sizeof(vertexSource) == sizeof(vertex_o)`, and they all evaluate to true! (`vertexSource == vertex_o` evaluates to false as expected, as they are different pointers).

For the life of me, I cannot figure out why trying to one variable would break my code, while passing another (functionally identical, as far as I can figure out) would break it. Does anyone have any ideas?

I recently managed to fuck up my dual boot of OSX and Ubuntu, so an hour or two ago I wiped my hard drive and installed Linux. I'm actually typing this from my ubuntu install right now and it's stable enough (well, besides google chrome crashing my system every 10 minutes), so I can't complain.

My one issue is that my boot times have increased significantly. Whenever I start my computer it just kinda hangs around on a white screen for 30 seconds before finally turning purple and showing me GRUB. My hunch (read: layman's guess) is that my boot system is throwing a temper tantrum and is trying to find some OSX partition to boot before finally relenting and booting me into GRUB.

It seems like this is a known issue, as it is [mentioned at the end of this askubuntu question here](http://askubuntu.com/questions/42711/how-to-install-ubuntu-as-the-single-os-on-a-macbook)- however I don't have a macbook partition on my HDD and I dont have an install disk. Are there any ways to fix this problem ubuntu-side?

There is *one* feature I would like to keep, and that is the internet recovery feature of the MacBook- where, upon pressing the alt button at startup, I can enter Internet recovery and do things like wipe the hard drive, reinstall Mac OS X, etc. I've been told this is a function of the BIOS, and that I cannot actually fuck this up my partitioning my hard drive. However when it comes to my computer I have a remarkable capability to fuck things up, and would appreciate some reassurances on this subject if you could give any

EDIT: It turned out the solution was very simple- wipe the hard drive and install from my usb stick. GRUB wasn't showing up so I downloaded and ran boot-repair, and now it's working fine.

I'm going for Mega Satan as the Lost, and my problem is almost never surviving, but actually getting the damn rooms to spawn. 

I've seen complaints about Angel Rooms before- here's a list of what needs to happen to even have a chance at getting the Key Pieces

* You have to pass up on your first Devil Deal
* You have to hope that you don't get another Devil Deal immediately after passing up your first, otherwise you're basically screwed
* You have to hope the game doesn't decide to screw you over for getting a Devil/Angel room two floors ago
* You need to hope that your Angel Rooms dont turn back into Devil Rooms for no reason (taking an Angel item doesn't even set precedent).
* You will most likely have to forgo shop items in order to donate coins to get an extra chance at getting an Angel room, if it decides to spawn at all (and the bonus resets each floor)

There are too many requirements, and you can't reliably set precedent like you can with Devil Deals. It's almost completely RNG based whether you can get the key pieces. It's gotten to the point where, instead of resetting for a good item on the Lost, I'm just resetting for Dad's Key

I make it to the Shop (the floor) without getting hit, and proceed to pick up Gnawed Lead and the Shears. At this point, I know I'm golden. I can almost see the tick on my post-it.

When I activate the Boss button on the Chest, a Diglett pops up on the Stain Wave (seriously Edmund, is this the only Boss fight ever on that floor?) and instagibs me, burning my 1up. Frustrating, but no biggie. I check the shop. There's a battery so I decide to use Gnawed Lead + Shears and then buy the battery just to be safe.

I beat the Boss waves and come back into the shop, and start rerolling with the machine, looking for good items. When the machine blows up I happen to glance at the charge on my spacebar item, my heart stops- it's empty. I race through the room- no batteries.

Anyways, to the point, Source 2 seems to both run slower and look worse on my computer. My computer's no gaming behemoth (Ubuntu 15.04, i7, nvidia 650m), and one of the things I was most looking forward to was increased FPS. To test this I loaded up Reborn with the [exact settings I have in regular dota](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/pipsqueaker/e843e967d11483ca8cd7/raw/7310800ff4341fc9275bc84aff9600c945c237da/Nothign), and I was a bit annoyed to discover that [in Reborn](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/6183788782844672152/31C92B487FE2CFEEC85739B17D90EC61BEF80CB5/) the game both looked and performed worse than in [Source 1](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/6183788782844648457/AAE42AE1307D887660E1BD92195B98601634C059/).

Also, the UI itself is laggy when I'm on higher settings, which I'm pretty sure should never happen

I've seen other Linux users reporting better FPS on their machines, so I was wondering if anything could be done to fix my situation. Is there any magic option like -dx11 (for windows, ofc) that I have to launch the game with?

I'll leave it unsolved as an exercise to whoever wants to try and figure it out. However I still don't know what the third attribute of gl_Position does, so I'd still appreciate an explanation for that


Alright, so basically in my program I'm feeding the vertex shader a vec3 given x, y, and w like so-

    const GLfloat vertices[] = {
            -0.5f, 0.5f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f,
            0.5f, 0.5f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f,
            0.5f, -0.5f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f,
            -0.5f, -0.5f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f
    };

    posAttrib = glGetAttribLocation(shaderProgram, ""position"");
    glEnableVertexAttribArray(posAttrib);
    glVertexAttribPointer(posAttrib, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE,
                          6*sizeof(float), 0);

My problem is that in my vertex shader, when I do this 

    vSource = ""#version 150 core\n""
            ""in vec2 position;""
            ""in vec3 color;""
            ""out vec3 Color;""
            ""void main() {""
            ""   Color = color;""
            ""   gl_Position = vec4(position.x, position.y, 
                                            0.0, 1.0);""
            ""}"";

Everything works fine. However, when I try to change w by changing the `1.0` in the assignment to `gl_Position` to `position.z`, I just get a black screen, no matter what my w's are set to.

I'll include a basic explanation of what I'm trying to do- I noticed when playing with OpenGL today that modifying the last attribute of gl_Position changes the ""depth"" on the screen (not sure what the third attribute does, could anyone explain that?). What I'm trying to do here is render a rectangle which is skew to the screen, which should result in a sideways-trapezoid.
