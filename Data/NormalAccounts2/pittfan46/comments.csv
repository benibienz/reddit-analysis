11,"As the peoples of kosmos of Hellas became more connected, it had seemed the entire peoples of Hellas had done the same. It was in this way, that the Confederation of Hellas' world, became the Hellenic World. 

They were the undisputed power of Hellas, and it was them that dominated the landscape. With Athens leading the way, **Attic Hellenic**, became the language of upper courts and aristocrats. **Doric Hellenic**, became the language of the common people. The language rougher and easier to understand than the Attic counterparts. 

Doric Hellenic became *the* dialect for the *demos* of the Aegean and of even the lands of Byzantion itself. 

On top of this, the Confederation of Hellas and their Archons began enforcing tribute upon the Poleis in Ionia, and their naval hegemony made it so any ship coming from Byzantion and beyond had to stop at a Confederate port. 

Their reach spread across the Black Sea, where Hellenes resided in Crimea.

The Byzantines, defined as all Hellenes under the influence of the Despot of Byzantion, benefited from the mainlanders ships, most notably Triremes, to defend their shores. The naval ram allowed for efficient boarding and sinking of ships. Both these features became common on Byzantine ships. The square rigging on larger Galleys still dominated, but on smaller more personal ships, lateen sails became common in Byzantine ships. 


The Confederation of Hellas sends the Archon Solon to meet with the Despot of Byzantion, in regards to a possible military alliance between the Despot on the Confederation. The proposal calls for reduced fees and taxes on each other’s ports as well as a mutual defense pact, in which each nation would defend each other from outside invaders and aid each other in wars to protect their interests. To show how serious this offer is, Solon pointed out the considerable manpower that the Confederation has already pledged to fight the Assyrians, an enemy far from their poleis.

567,"I would start with the Iliad and Odyssey by Homer, then the Theogony and Works and Days by Hesiod.

I would read Herodotus' Histories, and Thucydides Peloponnesian War.

If you can get through those, you will have a pretty comprehensive view of the political climate of Classical Greece IMO. 

I would read Livy, and Plutarch for Roman history--- I recommend Mellor's ""The Historians of Ancient Rome, an Anthology of the Major Writings""

As for other books I recommend:

Ancient Greece, From Prehistoric to Hellenistic Times by Thomas R. Martin

SPQR by Mary Beard

The Romans from Village to Empire by Boatwright, Gargola, Lenski, and Talbert

Ancient Greece a Political, Social, and Cultural History by Pomery, Burstein, Donlan, Roberts and Tandy.

The fundamental reason is that players who claim in those areas, usually claim alone, and go inactive. We are trying to build a world where players are clustered, and will RP with each other, building a rich culture of RP and history.

663,"&gt;There was no reason to stop Roman rule, the nation was rather peaceful and only acted on self defence

Debateable, I acted in my interests most of the time, which prompted people to declare war on me. I actively fucked with the Middle East, Russia, and Saxony. 

&gt;having the most advanced navy and Francia as an ally it would have been really hard for anyone to try it and it would have required more than one campaing after all of Italy and Illyria joined the Empire

absolutely key to my success, and I would say my ""peak"" was from the 1200s-1470s since I did have control of those areas. After the Mongols second go, a lot of this power subsided for quite a while. 

&gt;I still feel that Cyrene and Francia were the major factors and those were the point of no return

Yup, Cyrene especially provided stability in North Africa. 

&gt;Rome became the Euro-Med power when it became too much of a problem to be invaded

Only because people were hesitant. No one wanted to get in a long fight, which is understandable, but many players complained about my hegemony, none were willing to pry it away from me even though I worked hard to get it. 

I did get lucky, but I also worked hard to get where I was.

664,"I would say this is a bit late, the alliance with Cyrene was far before Lebanese, or even the Berber collapse, and Roman Francia was nearly 200 years after the fall of Lebanon. 

Many nations tried to stand up and solidify the region, but they continued to challenge Rome, which is why they inevitably failed. 

Eastern Iberia came under Roman control gradually as well. 

**************

But to summarize i guess:

I would say after the fall of the Iberian Empire, is when Rome became the dominant power in the Western Mediterranean, and when Lebanon and the Berbers fell, is when Rome filled in the Eastern Mediterraenan. 

After this, Rome shaped all of Europe, pursuing such things like empowering Egypt to combat Iran in the Indian Ocean, putting a Greek on the Russian throne, sponsoring a war between Francia and Saxony, etc.

Even after all this though, there were plenty of opportunities to break Roman grip over the region, people just never stepped up. ",2016-08-26 00:58:08+00:00,d6ww3wr,6.0,t1_d6wtu6w,3470.0,HistoricalWorldPowers

Herius Mucius spoke,

**The Senate will now vote on the approval of Dalmatian Statehood.**

And the Senators stood up and began to move. To the left, all the Senators that were opposed, to the right, the senators that were for. 

For a while, it seemed as though the room was stacked to the left, but Lucius Flavius had not moved, and with him the rest of the Imperial Party. After 10 agonizing minutes, he stood up, and walked over to the right, with most of the Imperials. 

A count was taken, and 265 of the 500 Senators voted for the admission of Dalmatia into the Empire. 

*******

Nikolić stayed in the Golden Palace as an honored guest. He dined with the Emperor as one of the embassies, but sitting next to him. He was in awe of the man. The two of them could not have spoken more than a handful of times, mostly small talk. Nikolić knew that the real battle was ahead. The Tribunal Council, the opinion of the People of Rome. 

********

He was escorted into another chamber, on the other side of the palace by Herius Mucius. This time, the Emperor was not in attendance. This was another sight. The chamber was barely half filled when Mucius began to read the transcripts from the Senate Session. 

**The Tribunes of the People of the Roman Empire will hear the proposal approved by the Senate regarding Dalmatian admittance into the Roman Empire.**

As he finished, the Tribunes were talking to each other, it didnt seem like they were even listening. More Tribunes filed in as Herius was speaking. Nikolić was very uncomfortable. 

He was not even allowed to speak. Herius Mucius himself seemed uncomfortable when he called for the vote. 

A little less than half of the Tribunes from each of the States of Italia, Hellas, and Anatolia approved of Dalmatian admittance, by Macedonian and Thrace's Tribunes voted, 66 out of 72 for the admittance of Dalmatia into the Empire. 

And the motion was passed. 

Herius Mucius spoke directly to Nikolić after the vote, 

""You will now stay, and meet with a committee of Senators, Tribunes and the Emperor to discuss the provisions of the Republic's admission. You will be able to send word back to your Rector with the news. Congratulations and welcome to Rome.""",2016-07-10 03:12:52+00:00,d5697x8,5.0,t1_d568hfm,1388.0,HistoricalWorldPowers
1128,"After Nikolić was finished with his statement, Herius Mucius rapped his lictor upon the ground yet again. 

**The floor is open to concerns and comments from the Senate**

A Senator from the right, the head of the Imperial Party stood up,

""The admission of the Dalmatia as a state is far too hasty, the states and nations around the eternal Empire of Rome have been falling and rising. Just in the past decade, the Kingdom of Bosnia, Montenegro, and Zagreb all existed. Just a few years ago, Austria existed as well. What makes him so sure Slavicia lasts long enough to be a threat to us? In a world where Austria can smash Saxony, but be bested by a barbarian, how can we count on Dalmatia being stable enough to be a state of the Empire? I move for a provision, that Dalmatia be an Autonomous territory of Rome for a period of 10 years before being admitted as a state.""

He sat down.

Another Senator, from the Republican Party rose.

""My concerns are not with the stability with Dalmatia, but with the balance and trouble of admitting a new state into the Empire. The Imperial Government requires Senators, and Tribunes to be sent to Rome. This will throw off the balance of power in these chambers. We enjoy a healthy amount of discourse and compromise here, my noble Romans, and admitting another State into the Empire will only throw this balance into disarray.""

He sat down.

Another Senator, from the Republican Party rose.

""My concern is with this supposed 'Republic.' They elect their Rector for life. Their 'Republic is a sham, like Macedonian and Thrace's Republic!!""

Boos came from another side of the chamber. The lictor was rapped on the ground again, and silence was on the floor once again.

An Imperial rose,

""Rome is in dire straits already, we have enough issues to deal with in the economic crisis. We need not more expenses. We need to cut back.""

And so it went on, for a period of 2 hours. 

Nikolić sat patiently, looking at the Emperor. 

After the Senate had finished, Herius Mucius rapped his lictor upon the floor.

The man seemed in awe of the spectacle of the Palace, and of the city. The guard escorted the man to the Praetor's chambers, where the Emperor's personal adviser met him. 

After some small talk, the Praetor told him that Nikephoros Botaneiates Doukas, Emperor of Rome would be in attendance. He was an admirer of the Republican principles that Dalmatia had built them on. Nikolić could feel the pressure mounting. The most powerful man in the world would be in attendance.

The French employed their strategy, but the experienced commanders of the Roman fleet was able to sink or cripple many of the French ships before they could get close. When the melee began, the Baghlahs moved to engage the French, to protect the Galleons and Carracks. The Baghlahs held many marines and fought bravely. The Galleons and Carracks circled the battle, firing on any French ship they could train their cannons on....


********

At the Balearic Islands, the Romans had put up their defenses, battlements were commandeered and Cannons were put in the fortresses of the Islands. The Roman detachment at the Balearics were surprised at the ferocity and the strategy of the French Navy. 

The French were able to capture many Roman ships before being driven back by the fortifications on the Balearic Islands. 

The Imperial Government was hesitant to officially declare war, as it would incite the rest of the Catholic world, but the conflict must end, and so a message was sent to the French Emperor, for a ceasefire and to meet to discuss terms.

Reumors of peace negotiations permeate the South. While the Romans are safe, the appearance of large armies being risen is deeply troubling. They look to consolidate their forces and best fighters, and confront one of these armies. An exclamation point on the war, but the commanders are reluctant due to the ramifications this would have on negotiations. 

The policy was that Roman armies would march from fort to fort, ready for battle, but would not engage unless Confederate armies engaged them first...

[M] I feel like I would do this in the South, large armies by the Confederates would be deeply troubling, and i would try to intimidate them away as peace negotiations are ongoing.

*********

After the fall of Lebanon, the Catholic Church suffered a huge blow when the successive Muslim nations committed genocide against Catholics, eliminating them from the region essentially. 

As of now, by PMs and RP, the most powerful Catholic State is Francia, with over 12 million Catholics in its borders. Aragon and Lower Britannia have a combined 12 million more Catholics. 

In the Roman Empire, the population is far more diverse. While most of the Roman Empire is Catholic, about 16 million Catholics, they also have sizable populations of Orthodox Christians, Faryabans, and Muslims. Nearly 1 million people in northern Italy are Faryabans. While in the provinces of Pontus, Ionia, and Asia, there are nearly 1.5 million Muslims intermixed with Catholic communities. 2.5 million Orthodox Christians live in Macedonia and Thrace. Other small minorities follow Judaism, Grattic faith, and even some the old pantheon of the Greco-Roman-Punic Gods.

2149,"So now I can properly respond to this. 

&gt;You seem to have 3 internal claims outside your own Roman Republic, those being the Hellenic Republic, the Serbian Principate,and the Republic of Macedonia and Thrace yet I haven't seen much RP between them if at all. You only really seem to care about/RP the TTC or as the Roman Republic. You seem to have made everyone give up land that wasn't really extremely close or connected to them, but you didn't really even let go of anything beyond the Italian Penninsula aside from Illyria. I think the cut on your territory should have been way more substantial than it currently is, perhaps giving up everything beyond the Italian Penninsula

I have lost soooo much land and power in RP over the past month/2 months voluntarily it is not even funny. [This](http://imgur.com/BTZlnk2) was about how big I was before the Mongol Wars, AND this was not even how large I was. The Empire kept growing. 

After the Mongol Wars, I lost all of Francia, Aragon, and Lower Britannia. There was nothing I could do to keep them as my nation the Roman Republic-Hellenic Republic and other nations erupted into civil war, with an Imperial Roman side and the Republic Hellenic side. The Imperials won, and the Republics were abolished, Illyria was kept as a client Kingdom. 

&gt;I think you should have probably been hit just as hard if not harder than Saxony due to your going through like 3-4 wars (Against Capadocia, Golden Horde, the RP thing against Russia, and also the war against Egypt)

Let us really observe the sequence of events here, because it is important. Of these four wars, I only had two of them going on at one time. My campaign against the Golden Horde happened *decades* before the war where Russia re-took them. In that time, my holdings in Uburzia, Crimea, and Southern Ukraine were governed as provinces. 

Cappadocia then attacked me, and in a short war, I won so utterly they were pushed back. 

*Then* Egypt declared war on me. As I was fighting Egypt, that is when the Russians kicked me out of his territories. 

This all happened over periods of weeks. 

&gt;olitical map is incorrect for your nation seeing as you showed the internal claims for Saxony yet you don't show your own internal claims which I have already given above.

Those claims (Hellenic Republic, Serbian Principate, and Republic of Macedonia and Thrace) dont exist anymore. 

I have given up Illyria-Serbia, and Aragon in Iberia. ",2016-05-08 15:33:29+00:00,d2xhji2,2.0,t1_d2x00a6,48415.0,HistoricalWorldPowers

One of the Romans, after Michael I finished speaking, said *It is customary to offer your guests food and drink before getting to business, it...eases the tension. I do not know how they do things in Russia, but proper negotiating etiquette is important.*

Michael I, although upset by these words, heard them loud and clear. If there was a nation that would not be disrespected, it would be Rome. He quickly looked to his guards to get some bread and beer.

The next negotiator, an old and wise man named Marcus spoke next,

*Onto your terms, you have defeated us in battle, in a most honorable way if the reports are accurate, and so all of Crimea, Uburzia, and Southern Ukraine will of course be handed over, once the Roman citizens are returned of course. That word unconditionally irks me, you see, the Roman Empire has forged some close relationships with the communities in these regions, and we would hate for them to severed, I am proposing a freedom to travel within these areas, protections for the ethnic Greeks that have lived there for centuries. I also request that all of these territories be given autonomy, but I understand if that is not feasible. Romans know what it takes to rule an Empire. As for the Palaiologos, in the eyes of Rome, there hasnt been a Russia since they were ousted by the mighty Mongols. You have defeated them, and have now united all the lands of Russia, it is only natural that you will be recognized, once this deal is approved of course. I request that the Palaiologos be given a seat on your advisory council, to appease the Senators in Rome. Your final point, the TTC, I am afraid that you will have to negotiate with them directly.*

Marcus stopped, gauging Michael I's reaction to his words. 

EDIT:

[M] I understand that this is a lot, but in essence i only rejected your TTC proposition because these men are not of the TTC. The rest of his words are requests.

I will try to address all of these things. 

**Rome**

The vast power of the Roman Navy was unable to enforce their rule upon the Francians, when the envoys came unto Rome, nothing about the Francian Navy was mentioned, giving the Empire of Francia *implied* recognition of the sovereignty of their seas and control of their coasts. 

While an embassy was already set up in the Golden Palace, recognition of Francia's dominion over Aragon, and Lower Britannia was officially recognized. 

**Illyria**

The envoys were welcomed into the legendary capital of Split, where they were escorted to sit before the King. While the Kingdom was its own autonomous state, most of the coast was still defended by Roman Imperial ships. The King would agree to a trade agreement with the Francians, as well as a sesperate embassy. It is clear the King of Illyria admires Francia for splitting from Rome.

Massive shipbuilding is a sure sign that war is soon to come in the Mediterranean, you know this.

* The demands to vassalize Egypt are false, we offered to rent him ships bearing the Roman standard, and told him that his ships should bear it too, pirates do not attack Roman ships, they fear retribution.

The Romans, with the aid of the inhabitants of the area, construct Palisades, walls, battlements, and other fortifications. 

A second shipment of repeating crossbows came as a great relief, as a quarter of the Romans were armed on the walls with these weapons. 

Other fortifications were mounted ballista, on the battlements, and Onagers, who would fling Naphtha grenades at possible combatants. 

1,000 Yashouan arrived just before the the first siege, bringing the armed force to 3350 men. 

The TTC has now invested heavily in the area, with 5 Carracks of war, and 10 Caravels, rented from the Ducal fleet of Yashou patrolling the waters, and bringing food.

2599,"okay the TTC is the Thuran Trading Company. To preface, I will say that they precede the Indian Ocean Company by a few weeks. They are a private company that operates out of major cities in the Mediterranean, formerly only the cities of the former Thuran Federation. 

A few weeks ago, they began to expand to other cities as the Federation fell and the Company rose. They have their own navy and conduct their own business. 

The biggest deal they have is a deal with the Indian Ocean Company, where the IOC will sell the luxuries to the TTC in Alexanadria, and the TTC will distribute the luxuries across the Mediterranean. 

It has only been recently that TTC operations have expanded into other areas, but they have been able to strike deals with Northern France, the straits of Gibraltar, and have even expanded into the Far Atlantic, to Madiera, Yashou, and Cape Verde. 

The TTC has made small expeditions about a week and a half ago to /u/laskaka .

The business in the Persian Gulf is inherently different and very experimental. Trade in the Indian Ocean is handled exclusively by the IOC, the TTC sees this and is very uneasy about it. So they went for insurance in case the IOC turns on them. 

 The TTC has knowledge of ships bigger and better than the Durrani Emirate's Navy, since they model their own ships from the Roman Empire's Navy. So as of now, the TTC is a ship renter. Building ships bigger, stronger, and overall better than the Durrani and renting those ships out to merchants/the government.

2910,"I'm gonna be honest with you and say that your army at this point would be weak, sick, and exhausted while Cyrene's forces would be fresh and ready to fight.

You want to play logic, then communication between both of Cyrene's armies would be open as well, and the moment your army at Alexandria would move to break the siege, the other army would support. Logically, your nation has been all over the place, you just suffered through the most catastrophic battle in the Near East, bringing the most catastrophic plague to your nation. Then, Eurasianlynx declared war on you, in which you rose 300 ships. In that time, your vassal revolted.

So a portion of this army fought the Durrani, then it sprinted back to Egypt, where it then put down the rebellion in Judea, then rushed to Alexandria. 

Your troops are tired, discouraged, and their morale is probably at an all time low. 

They would run into a determined Cyrenean army who would then call for reinforcements from Cairo.

Does that sound like success to you?

On the matter of the Seas, you're not unopposed, and I did check Cyrene's post history to make sure she had those ships. While you would do some raiding, your Naval Marines are just not enough to actually storm fortified positions.

This is also without considering that the conflict with the Durrani is looking to be a lot more complex and drawn out too.

These Tribunes, although having little power in foreign affairs, essentially set the policy domestically.

The Zhixulian Order, to become a major player in Roman politics, must infiltrate the Imperial Senate. To do that, they must infiltrate the Hellenic or Roman Senates, which are dominated by old and prestigious families of the Republics. 

While this was a monumental task, there was a way to get named an Imperial Senator by the Emperor himself, usually by winning a great victory for the Romans. This has happened multiple times, with the generals of the wars with the then-Frankish Empire and then the Jewish Republic sprung a few families into prominence. 

The few Tribunes could not make the journey to Samarkland, but sent a message of this truth. It would take a monumental event to happen, infiltration of a major family (think Julian, Claudian, Brutii, Pompeian), or generations to control the Roman Empire for their purposes. 

Another way to control the Roman Empire would be to infiltrate their individual states, but this is not recommended, as it would take more time, money and effort.

The Illyrians were not as depressed by the plague, being the immediate neighbor of the Bohemains, they fought with the fury of their ancestors.

notice the army marching to the Danube bends around the Northern side of the River, so I would be cutting you off from the rest of your Empire and trapping you besieging fortresses without supply lines. They would also look for a fording point to go and relieve the fortresses. 

The Second army marching North to Prag will probably happen much later than the one relieving the Danube, due to the make-up of the troops (Francian and Aragonese). I am willing to be flexible with that, since the amount of troops risen is quite a bit more than originally planned. The idea would be to break the siege of Prag.

Food was a plenty, and there were heated baths. They lived in luxury. 

It was two days before they were lead to the Imperator throne room. He sat in a simple toga with purple edges, with a simple laurel wreath crown.

Above him was an enormous Eagle made of Gold, stretching 10 feet across. Under it was a banner that had the letters SPQR on it. 

Before the diplomats sat Antonius Flavius Pius, 3rd Imperator of the Flavian Dynasty, Imperator Omnis Romani Imperii. He was a young man, aged 35. He looked at the men from the East with a smile and spoke in Latin.

""I am graced with your presence, friends from the East. I hope you have found your stay in Rome pleasurable. Now what business do you have here. I am not familiar with the nations of the East past Persia.""

They walked down the [road of victories](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWorldPowers/comments/3zcduo/via_victoriarum/) and stopped to observe the obelisks of all the conquests of the Roman people.

Julius was very aware of the situation with the Jewish faction in Thurii, which was half the reason for his visit. 

As he walked into the Tribunal Senate Chamber, saw the split factions, and the tension. 

He spoke,

*Glorious Senators of Thurii,*

*Long have I admired your government system, with far territories, and fair governance, but something has happened. The Frankish Empire goaded your Federation to war, and seized control of your Francian territories. Rome stood with Thurii, and Rome fought with Thurii. My predecessor orchestrated the first landings in Southern Francia, where Roman superiority was shown, but the Frankish Emperor Clovis was clever, launching a counter offensive.*

*This is the situation I was thrown in. To fight war against a determined Empire. And so we fought with you, sending our fleets far and wide. Untimely falls of the Kingdom of Augelogne and an untimely response by the Frankish Navy trapped two of our armies, over 40,000 Roman-Thuran soldiers. But the coalition against the capital was strong, and moved to besiege the capital.*

*This is where the disagreement lies, for the Franks now control all of Francia and are vassals of Rome. But look and see, the Frankish Empire is no more, the war was won, the Franks acknowledge the superiority of Hellas-Roma, and are brought into the fold.*

*For compensation, I offer you Thurans the cities of Genoa, and Khaldola, trade hubs of the old Gulgean Empire, and the Republic of Genoa. The Franks are paying the Federation large sums of reparations for the war, as they were the loser in it, the the cause of the war.*

We speak Latin, the language of the Glorious Ligurian Empire. The Romans worship the Christian God, as well as the pantheon of the Romans.*

He took out a Bible, and the stories of the gods preserved from ancient writers. He also took out a map, and pointed to where the Roman Empire was, and shaded all the lands the Empire possessed and controlled. 

*Rome offers a variety of goods, and precious metals. Here, have some Wine, and Mead, it is some of the finest in the whole world. Have some of the Olive oil, it is a hot commodity in the Mediterranean. As for why we are so pale, we are pale for the same reason you are dark. The men and women of the lands of the Romans are pale, just as the people of the lands of India are dark.*

Clodius gave a laugh saying this before offering the Keralans a drink of the wine from the West. presented a small clothe from the Imperator of Rome, saying the exotic East has made contact with them, and presented them with this silk.

He was also a Roman citizen. 

Lucius called him to his private quarters and asked him a very serious question. The Throne of Muscovy was ripe for the taking, Konstantinos Palaiologos birthright, but he would have to renounce his Roman citizenship.

The Seljuk Turks stabbed the Roman Empire in the back and invaded a close ally of the Roman Empire, and then Osman, the first Ottoman Governor used his position to try and extort the Roman Empire, who had given the Turks so much, to ransom 30,000 loyal citizens of Rome.* 

*Osman later [declared himself Sultan](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWorldPowers/comments/3r5dod/the_foundation_of_the_devleti_aliyyei_osm%C3%A2niyye/), and king of Anatolia, which seems to me implies that he has no superior.*

*After Osman died, his son, Orhan, has made numerous threats across the Bosporus straits and Hellespont and has looked to mobilize against the allies of Rome once again. The aggression of the Turkish people has caused unnecessary tension and it seems that another war is inevitable. In a time where war has been all too common, I plead you to take control of this situation.*

*The fact that it took this long for the Roman Empire to learn who the true leader of Baghdad and Anatolia was is a testament at the conniving nature of the Ottoman 'Empire' as they call it.

5976,"The Consul and Agrippa read the letter with great suspicion. They could not believe it. After centuries, the first Greek, then Bulgarian, and now Jewish knights of Jupiter were begging for help.

Agrippa discussed the terms with his advisory council, the consuls and praetors, and decided to call a meeting of the Union of Hellas-Roma. The proceeding meeting would take place in Rome as soon as possible. Representatives from the Thuran Federation, Serbian Principate, the Hellenic Republic, and the Kingdom of Illyria would all be present.

/u/admortis

Agrippa sent a letter back saying the Knights offer was being considered. He apologizes for not being able to give an immediate answer. The war would have to be fought without the aid of the Romans *this* time. 

He also expresses that given approval of the Union, the Knights would be admitted into the Union of Hellas-Roma with the following conditions

* the Knights of Jupiter will limit their empires ambitions to anatolia 

* common currency

* the Grandmaster will be of Greek origin

* all provisions of the Union will apply to the Knights of Jupiter


A letter is sent to the empire of Saxony, requesting that they veto the muscovites war against the Knights of Jupiter.

It is great to hear from the Knights of Jupiter once again. Forgive me if I was rude, for it was in my youth when Bogdan invaded the Empire of the Romans and set fire to our fields. When we needed help, he kicked us down.

I suppose it is a reaction to be wary of the Domain that I cannot control as I saw the suffering first hand wrought by the Knights. 

I am glad to be hear you will be merciful to the denizens of the Near East, for they are young and foolish, as Rome was when we entered into a Union with Gulgea.

I hope to see more open dialogue between the Knights of Jupiter and the Roman Republic. 

Best,

6389,"Concerning ""in the name of"" and not ""in the names of,"" The Pope addresses that the Trinity is three persons in one God, a mystery in its own right. 

The Pope looks to other passages:

"" For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.

 And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.""

John 5:7-8

""I and Father are one.""

John 10:30

In the first Epistle to the Corinthians

""But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him""

1 Corithinians 8:6

These clearly state that the trinity, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are three parts of the singular God the almighty.

6677,"I have many internal claims available because of how my Empire is governed.

I have [Map](http://i.imgur.com/yzWGxBs.jpg):

* Serbian Principate(Light Green)

* Kingdom of Illyria(Pink)

* Hellenic Republic(Yellow)

I suppose the most attractive option for an internal claim for me would be the Kingdom of Illyria--a client state of Rome. The Kingdom is descended from the Illyrian Empire.

The Kingdom enjoys a large amount of autonomy and can even receive foreign dignitaries. 

The Kingdom is bordered by the Serbian Principate, which is another client state of Rome and the Illyrian Principate to its immediate south. 

Things to note:

* When doing diplomacy, you would need to tag me as Rome is still in control of the Kingdom.

* Your military makes up most of Rome Eastern forces. 

* The Kingdom of Illyria is very well protected from other nations.

**Relations with Rome:** Good

**Autonomy:** High


The Hellenic Republic would also be a good internal claim for people who love Hellenistic culture. They run a Republic in the exact same style as the Roman Republic does. Although at this point the terms would be in Greek instead of Latin. The Hellenic Republic is very much an autonomous state, able to receive diplomats and negotiate with neighboring nations. The only reason I think this wouldnt be as fun is because big bad Lebanon is invading Hellas at the moment.

Things to note:

* When doing diplomacy, you would need to tag me and /u/admortis as we are all voting members in the Union of Hellas-Roma.

* The Hellenic Republic is mostly a Naval power probably has the most ships of the Empire.

* You are surrounded by three very powerful nations.

**Relations with Rome:** Excellent

**Autonomy:** Nearly complete

The Serbian Principate is an especially interesting nation. While they are a monarchy, the institutions of a Republic are still in place. This could make for some very good RP . The Serbs are ruled by a *princeps*.

The Serbs are an interesting nation. They used to be a player nation who went inactive, so there is a small history of independence. They are fierce fighters, but lack in the equipment and training because of their distance from Rome. The reason I do put them last is because they are quite backward and vulnerable. The Serbs also have an interesting relationship with Rome. Although the leadership likes the Romans, the Republic routinely settles veterans and *Romanizes* the area.

This has caused a feeling that Roman culture and customs are stamping out the Serbs. The Romans monitor the Serbs interactions as they are a pivotal neighbor to the Knights of Jupiter. 

Things to note:

* When doing diplomacy you need to tag me as Rome is still in control of the Principate.

* Serb military isnt too strong/

* Serbia is landlocked.

* You are vulnerable because of your distance.

**Relations with Rome:** Meh

**Autonomy:** Low


Questions:

* How would expansions work for internal claims?

The snickers stopped, and there was a tension in the air not seen since the Berber Empire sent the Sicilian note to a Thuran family. 

A quick discussion was had, and the Senate assigned two commanders to go to Muscovy, and sent them to the far reaches of the Illyrian Kingdom, where they would recruit troops.

Grumbling from the Senate as Rome seemed to get involved in yet another war stymied any prospect of sending any Roman citizen abroad, nevertheless, an army was thrown together and sent.

All the best of the Romans were out fighting the mighty Republic of Lebanon, but the group sent north were a tough and veteran group.

The Princeps of Serbia and the King of Illyria were able to raise 1 legions, 5120 Legionnaires and 880 Hoplites, along with 4,000 Equites, for a total of 10,000 men.

Along with the convoy, there a large amount of Roman equipment, weapons, and armor was brought along, as well as the drill commanders from Rome. The men of the 30,000 peasants would be trained and armed by Rome. ",2015-09-15 02:25:02+00:00,cv1wfxv,1.0,t3_3kuwk8,87216.0,HistoricalWorldPowers

So it says that your troops landed. I find it highly improbably that they all landed without any resistance. Less than half of my standing army is in Pinko's nation. So i will RP this i suppose. [M]



Because of the recent tensions between Lebanon and Rome, the Hellenic Republic was diligent in patrolling the coasts of their lands. The main reason this was happening was because of the bulk of the Roman army was in Africa, fighting the Berbers. 


The attack was swift and fierce. By the time the Hellenic militias at the isthmus could respond, the Lebanese forces had already seized the Canal. With the Roman forts stormed and captured, the Lebanese had an easily defensible position near Corinth. The alarms sounded and emergency levies were called. 

The Hellenic Navy, which was stationed at the administrative capital of Athens, was able to see the fleet of Lebanon coming. The Greeks mustered 50 Normal Dromon, 1 Octere, 10 Heavy Dromon and and 15 Light escort Dromon. This fleet engaged the Lebanese Navy right off the coast of Athens, in plain view of the city.

It was truly a sight to behold, the Lebanese Navy used their Greek Fire to great effect, but the experience and flexibility of the Hellenic Navy, as well as knowledge of the waters, allowed the Greeks to gain the upper hand. The Greeks were able to repel the fleet, but the islands around Attica and Hellas as a whole were overrun. 

The Greeks were able to force a stalemate at Corinth. 

The initial waves of Lebanese troops and the valiant defense of Athens were both troublesome and morale boosting. More Legions would have to be raised, as well as many units of Equitati. This was a fight for the survival of the Hellenic Republic...

When the Roman Republic heard of this sudden action, the Senators sneered at the cowardice of the Lord Komutan. The Romans, instead of being despondent and depressed, quickly looked for help from Rome's allies.

A message was sent to the Knights of Jupiter:

*Rome is at war. Your longtime friends and allies have been attacked unexpectedley by the Republic of Lebanon. The Lord Komutan didn't even have the courtesy to meet with the Roman Consul, and now he attacks without even sending a formal declaration of war. How cowardly of the Lebanese to do this without notice. The Romans require your help. Your Greek brothers the Thurans require your help.*

Another weapon that the Romans provided for their allies was the *Spatha*. Although the legionnaires used the more effective migration period sword, these Spatha are deadly predecessors.

* i would say about 10 normal Dromon at Balearics, Thuran strait, Corsican-Sardinian straight, and Corinthian Canal, which is 300 marines each. 

* Cyrene has 8,000 Legionnaires, and 15,000 Cavalry now. I also deployed a large fleet to help out Cyrene, but thats done with now so theyd be relieved of duty.

As the Francian ship docked, the official escorted them to the Foreigner's palace. The next day they sat in the office of the consul. It was a strange meeting, with the Francians asking about the *Census*, how it was administered, what was required and how often it was done.

The domestic consul answered him truthfully, every five years, they log every citizen and their family members. It is a great way to have an accurate record of exactly who is eligible for service and who owes what in taxes. 

The Consul says that establishing the Census in such a large nation would require a vast expansion of government workers. He says the Romans employ 10 Censor's per region and the client states of Rome do the same. He droned on as to how each Cesnor needed at least two men working under him to fulfill these responsibilities. 

As he saw the Francian envoy's eyes start to glaze over, he asked if they wanted to continue the meeting tomorrow. He offered them some Roman drinks and some food. The Francians accepted, but drank their own drink. The Consul was intrigued and asked to try what they were having. 

As the consul sipped on the **whiskey** he got quite drunk fast. The strong drink was unlike anything the Romans had at their taverns. 

He asked the next morning if he could learn how to make this strong drink, for his family owned a network of taverns in the city of Rome.

* Each region, by votes of their citizens, elect three Tribunes, who serve for five years. Two of the Tribunes must be of the Plebeian class while the Third Tribune must be of the Patrician Class. The Tribunes essentially talked of issues regarding the people. That is where their power comes from. They meet in the [Tribunal Council](https://dj008.k12.sd.us/Old%20Website%20Materials/reading/The%20Mausoleum%20at%20Halicarnassus/halicarnassus6.gif) to discuss policy and settle issues domestically. The most important role of the Tribunes is that they elect the two consuls, which brings me to those guys.

* Their are two consuls, just like in the OTL, and they are the people who set policy. Because the tribunes select the consuls, the two men who are selected often have the backing of the Tribunes. One consul dictates Foreign policy, and the other dictates domestic policy. Consuls cannot serve more than one term in a row.

* The Senate, made up of 100 patrician members, is by far the most aristocratic part of the Republic. They meet in the [Senate Chamber](http://images.everytrail.com/pics/fullsize/1836715-Vittoriano.jpg). Their power is great, as they have the power to veto any motion with a 66/100 majority. They also control the Republic's finances. So essentially, to get anything done, you need to go through the Senate. 

Other important positions are the Censors, the Praetors, and the Proconsuls (a relatively new position).

* Praetors are the Consuls personal assistants. They are appointed by the consuls are presumably the position many Romans serve in before becoming Consul. There are 8 of them.

* Censors are the main bureaucrats of the Republic, with 10 appointed per region, these men collect taxes every year, and conduct censuses once per term. They do most of their bureaucratic work in the [censor's office](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/76/Hamilton_high_school.jpg) when they are in Rome. 

* With the rise of client states, the consul appoints a proconsul to oversee these states activities. Client states are mostly autonomous, but the proconsul has the power to override any of their actions.

Roman Client States are:

* Hellenic Republic (operates as Rome's does)

* Kingdom of Illyria (continuation of the Illyrian Emperors family)

* Republic of Budimpesta (operates as Rome's does)

because research is done once a week, think of it as a skill that is learned and mastered over 25 years of time. so it is hardly immediate.

Tensions. hmm, there is some tension between Rome and Gulgea because they were in a union for about years. Lebanon and the Knights of Jupiter have some serious tension. Francia is a pretty isolationist nation that is vehemently against salvery.

the Religions that dominate Europe are a mix of paganism, Christianity, Faryaba, and Judaism. The Greco-Roman nations follow their pantheon, although there is a growing Christian following. Iberia has the biggest concentration of Christians and Jews. the Eastern half of Iberia is more Christian and the Western half is Jewish. Northern France is mostly Christian.

8061,"Places to claim: Central and eastern Europe are desperate for players. And Central Africa, we are trying to get a silk road going. There are places in the Arabian peninsula that are small. I think it'd be cool to have a bunch of small nations there.

Politics: The political climate in the Mediterranean is interesting. With 10 separate users, a lot of differing opinions. Fairly recently,  I would have divided it into 3 separate blocs. The greco-roman nations,  the Caliphate, and Lebanon. Iberia is pretty powerful and Cyrene is a newer nation. 

Smallpox seems to be shaking things up as it has ravaged the two Faryaban nations, Gulgea and Imazighen. Sicily is hit pretty hard too.

Francia is fairly isolationist, as is the illyrian  empire. Iberia is expansionist. I am finishing up in Greece. 

Lebanon is the nation with the best hegemony over the region.

In africa, you have another Amirate if the Caliphate, tinko, itechoyoppa, kongo,and yashou. All these players are active but need another nation to help revitalize the region.

The Empire of Afghanistan was just conquered by the mongols.

India has some good RPers  too.

Cultures: a mix of hellenisn, frayaba faith (west African Islam kinda), Christianity and Judaism dominate the Mediterranean. You basically have control over your culture but it's no fun if you're not receptive to other nation's cultures.

The leadership was in Aragon, yes, but it was around that region where our faith was born and developed, where else would we have been?

The suffering of Greece and Aragon are purely political phenomenon, the fall of a state in Greece and the fall of the state of Aragon..

 The Church, the institution that binds all Christians in faith, has had missions ot Gulgea,  and were permitted to practice within their borders, just as Roman amd germanic pagans are. Yet these other faiths are not banned. 

Surely as the head of the Faryaba faith you know the difficulties in managing a wide variety of cultures without losing the core message. 

You speak of Christianity being the cause of the fall of Aragon when it was the Faryaban nations that destabilized the kingdom. We Christians did not ask for that.

But I am not here to talk politics, my concern lies with the oppression of tens of thousands of Christians innocent of any wrongdoing,  Christians that were allowed to worship in Gulgea up until now. What changed?  Why should they suffer because Aragon fell? States rise and fall all the time. What of the Bohemian kingdom? Wasn't the king Faryaban?

He looked at the billing and saw the Roman team was playing the team from Lebanon, and after that the team from Titun B'iwe was set to play the team from the Illyrian Empire.

8573,"Each time the Aegean Empire's ships came to engage the Roman fleet, the Roman Dromon were able to use their harpax to pull more of the ships close and capture them whenever possible. Although the Empire's raids were effective against the Roman fleet, superior weaponry, better trained sailors, and more experienced marines were able to keep the blockade effective. Soon, over 10,000 Peloponnesian troops were landed and made an attempted to capture the island.

With the island blockaded, the Aegean Empire's forces on Cythera would either fight and die or surrender.

****

The scout Dromon reach the Admare, who then dispatched a two fleets, one went down the southern coast of the Peloponnese looking for the Aegean Empire's raiders and to relieve Cicero's forces, the other sailed for Melos. The Admare reasoned that this would be where the main operations of the Aegean empire would be. The Dromon fleet headed to Melos consisted of a full landing party of heavily guard Phortegoi stocked full of Roman soldiers.


*****

The envoys from Rome quickly told the Praetor that the Aegean Empire had seized control of Roman islands near the Peloponnese, and the Roman fleet was engaging the Empire's fleet as they spoke. The Praetors urgently rose the matter to Councilman Al-Tusi, informing them of the situation. They urged Al-Tusi to send orders to Emperor Nestor to stand down.

8593,"Where to start.

****

Rome arose in a very tense atmosphere. Many nations, some hostile and some friendly were around the new nation. Speaking mainly latin, the new Kingdom of Rome forged a fast friendship with the Kingdom of Gulgea, a formal alliance that would last over 250 years. The relationship was often a tense one as Rome tried to expand its influence in a way the Kingdom of Gulgea did not exactly approve of.

The constituent status of Rome in the Union played a large part, and still plays a large part in the Roman psyche. The Romans are still trying to prove their power to the Mediterranean world. This is displayed in friendships with Hellas, Thurii, the Imazighen and the Knights of Jupiter.

****

Now, the Republic plays a huge part.

The Republic:

The Republic is run by two consuls, two patricians. One of them sets domestic policy, the other sets foreign policy. The Consuls hold office for five years. This is relatively simple. How the Consuls are chose leads me to the next branch.

The Tribunal Council votes and chooses the two consuls. Tribunes, three from each region, vote on which man they wish to be consul. Tribunes are elected by citizens of each region every five years. One of the Tribunes must be from a patrician class, which has a property requirement. This requirement obviously makes it so mostly men from the province of Roma are tribunes. The other two, are from the plebs. The tribunes then vote on two consuls they wish to serve. The consuls must be selected from the Senate.

The third part of the Republic is the Senate. Comprised entirely of Patricians, the Senate has little legislative power. The key role of the Senate is that they hold the strings for the treasury.

Other government positions include Censors, who perform the Roman Census and collect taxes, 10 per region. And the Praetors, two per consul. They are selected by the consuls two aid them in their work and to even step in if he is unable.

*****

Sports play a big part of Roman life. The Cassian Amphitheatre can hold up to 75,000 spectators and the Circus Maximus can hold up to 150,000 spectators. It is at these venues that Romans watch the various sporting competitions which include the sports of the Ligurian Games. the most popular sport is Gladiator Matches. These are competitors, mostly freemen, who combat each other with blunted weapons and strict rules. 

Sporting events are held in smaller amphitheatres around the Republic. The largest stadium outside of the Cassian Amphitheatre holds just under 20,000 spectators.

*****

Religion in Rome plays a part, but the state is a bit hesitant to get too involved. The Roman Pantheon, which is very similar to the Hellenistic Pantheon, is very prominent. Elaborate temples are in Rome and around the Republic. 

There is a following of the Faryaba faith, as well as adherents to Catholicism, and Judaism. The vast majority of people still follow the pagan religions.

*****

Language in Rome is pretty straightforward. Since one of the requirements to become a citizen is to know latin fluently, Latin is the main language. Greek and Gulgean is another major language. Punic and Illyrian are smaller groups of speakers.

*****

Slavery, well Rome has slaves obviously. While slaves are a large part of Roman life, the economy is not based completely on slaves. The general attitude is, ""well youre a slave."" Most are treated well and protected by the law from any punishments too brutal.

8595,"With hoplites defending the flanks of the legions, the cavalry from the Aragonese were repelled rather quickly, buying time for the legions to form up and engage the main force. While the Aragonese were enthusiastic, their formations were quickly broken with hundreds upon hundreds of Pila being thrown from the legions, as well as being barraged by crossbowmen. 

A cohort is left in reserved to manage the siege weapons.

When the legionnaires engaged the main force, they were able to drive them back into the nearest city with the 3,000 equitati horsemen picking them off. 

*****

In the south, the army down there set up their siege weapons to begin barraging the walls of Ajaccio. The equitati in that army patrolled the countryside looking for reinforcements who may flank the Roman force.

*****

The Roman navy was constantly sending out small dromon scouts to look for reinforcements. So it was not a surprise when the remnants of the Aragonese fleet came up. The Romans were prepared. This time, instead of trying to sink them, they aimed to drive them north of the island to combat any ships that may come from the north.

8596,"The Roman Dromon are surprised when the first ship hit by the jars burst into flames. The commanders of the ship ordered them to spread out and keep moving. Most jars fell into the sea, harmless, but the ones that hit, the marines tried desperately to put them out.

The commander of the fleet, Cicero, came up with an idea. He had the Dromon charge the ships and get close to them, if the Empire was going to use their Greek Fire against the Roman ships, then their ships would be affected as well. They armed their batllistae with Harpax and pulled the Empire's ships close to the Dromon. The swifter Dromon ships were able to use their spurs to run over the oars of the clunkier -Reme ships, destroying the oars and making the ship a sitting duck. 

When the Roman marines, armed with legionnaire gear got close enough, they boarded many of the ships. Many of these veterans fought on Corsica against the Kingdom of Aragon. The Roman soldiers, with their experience against the greener Aegean marines, were able to capture many ships. 

The Roman Dromon were slowly able to drive the Aegean Fleet away from Cythera. The Romans in total, lost 7 Normal Dromon to Greek Fire and 2 Heavy Dromon to Greek Fire.

The Roman ships were able to sink 15 of the Empire's ships, and capture 7 more. 

Cicero sent Small Dromon ships up the coast of the Peloponnese to tell the Admare of what transpired here and to sent reinforcements. He sent another squadron of Small Dromon ships to Rome, and another to Aleppo. He told them to describe the events that had happened to the Council, that the Aegean Empire had attacked and seized control of Roman land. 

Cicero would then blockade the island and wait for Greek and Roman soldiers to arrive from the Peloponnese. 


**** 

In Rome, the Senate and Tribunal Council debate whether it would be appropriate to declare war on the Aegean Empire.

The Northern force pillaged and plundered the north.

The central force was to march straight to the Grand City of Sofia and lay siege to it.

8636,"The Roman envoys are revealed to actually be praetors of the Roman Republic. Chosen by elected Tribunes to aid the Consuls in their duties. The Praetor was an extremely respected and powerful man.

The Praetor Julius, presented the Council with fine Roman wine, mead, figs, garum with bread, and gave them all the respect that tradition dictated. He then spoke softly, *As you may know, many nations arose after the Kingdom of Hellas descended into chaos. Rome was able to keep control over the core territories and the Peloponnese for the most part, but the Theban League, Macedonia and this self proclaimed Aegean Empire are not legitimate in the eyes of Rome.*

*After King Xanthias was killed in a victory against the Aegean Empire, Rome took direct control of the Peloponnese. Very unsurprisingly, the Aegean Empire continued to raid and pillage the Peloponnese.*

*Roman vessels defending the Peloponnese engaged with the Aegean Empire's ships, and they saw something very curious.*

He took out from his robe a copy of an agreement signed by both Roman and Lebanese officials to do joint naval exercises by Sicily.

*Many of the tactics and strategies outlined here, and of course, the equipment, were similar to what the Lebanese taught and showed us all those years ago. We are here to hear your side of this curiosity before jumping to rash conclusions. My questions are, why are the Aegean Empire's equipment, tactics, and weapons Lebanese? And do you know that the Aegean Empire has attacked Roman land?*

He continues,

*We wish to continue to have good diplomatic relations with the Republic of Lebanon, successor to the Covenant. So let's get to the truth of this messy situation.*

8638,"When the Roman Republic gained control of the Peloponnese, they soon found themselves under attack from the Aegean Empire again. This time it seemed they were raiding and pillaging instead of actually invading. 

This lead to a swift response. Rome had over 40 Ships station at Athens and the next time Aegean Empire ships were spotted, the Roman Dromon fleet engaged the Hellenic fleet. While the Romans were able to drive back the raiders and even capture and sink some of the ships, they were surprised at the Aegean Empire's tactics and skill in battle. Some of the Aegean's Quinqueremes were able to go toe-to-toe with the Roman Heavy Dromon.

After the battle, the Admare asked one of the captured officers who had been training them. After much interrogation the Admare learned that the Lebanese were training and arming the Aegean Empire. A feeling of dread fell on the Admare's heart. He thought that the Lebanese would be tied up with the former Pisidian territories well before they would turn their attention to the Aegean.

He sent word to Rome.

*****

In Rome, the consul Cincinnatus was shocked at the news. Many of the Senators were calling for war, and in reality, Cincinnatus supported that notion. But when put to a vote in the Senate and Tribunal council, over 65% of the officials agreed that Rome should not tangle itself with the Republic of Lebanon.

Cincinnatus moved to send an envoy to Aleppo, the Lebanese capital to discuss the issue. He figured sending the envoy straight to the capital and not Crete would show the Lebanese how serious the situation was. In the meantime, the Consul sent over two Legions, 10,000 Crossbowmen, 50 Normal Dromon and 30 Heavy Dromon. Small Dromon scouts would patrol the coast of the Peloponnese for Aegean raiders. The Consul also commissioned the construction of one Octere and two Hexaremes to serve as capital ships to the navy in the Aegean.

With the arrival of more Roman forces, The Aegean Empire needed to withdraw raiding the Peloponnese. They stood no chance of defeating the Romans in battle, land or sea.

The large above water spurs destroyed the oars of many of the ships. This allowed for easy boarding and capture. 

The remaining five Quadiremes and 10 Triremes limped north.

The Roman transport ships made it ashore from Rome. The army landed with two Legions, 12,000 troops( 10240 Legionnaires and 1760 Hoplites), 7,500 Crossbowmen, five equitati (3,000 Horsemen), 5 Onagers and 5 ballistae on the Eastern coast of Corsica. 

***

To the South, The smaller Aragonese fleet and their boldness surprised the Roman fleet. The Hexareme, with the 4 Quadiremes, are able to sink an astounding 7 Light Dromon, 4 Normal Dromon, before being driven back by the heavier ships. The 10 Triremes are driven back by the remaining light and normal Dromon.
