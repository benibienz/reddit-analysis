They had come to discuss the previous events, and the future of Hellas. Together, these men joined to form the **Assembly of Hellas**, which would meet every five years to discuss matters of importance to all Hellenes.

Statement put forward by the Basileus Archon, Pelopidas of Thebes:

What is to be done about the unincorporated Hellenes of Asia? Asian Hellenes were always in disarray, the Auric, and Kilikian peoples succumbing to invaders quite easily. These places still have Hellenes living in them, yet are cut off from the order, the kosmos that Polis life was granted to them. 

What a great crime this is! Woe to Zeus and to Hades. When the Assyrians came from the East, they were powerless, only Hellenes of Poleis, in their heavy armor and organized lines could defeat them. Now the Videti encroach again on these borders!

And of the West, there is still nothing done of the Carthaginians blatant meddling in Hellenic affairs, after Aristocrat and Archon Draco made a very fair deal with him. We must act to show the world once again we will not be trifled with. 

We must regain trade and diplomatic relations with our southern neighbor, Egypt, the great Pharaoh owes Hellenes a debt, we must re-establish contact with the Djerai, and deal with the Videti in time.

There is a reason why Hellenes can refer to people from Pylos to Pontus on the borders of Asia Minor. 

##Lions

[Lions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_lions_in_Europe) are extremely well revered and respected among Hellenic culture, and the native Lions are often respected. Many rituals, pitting men against Lions in the Amphitheatre, happen as a religious ceremony. The Lions represent the fury and might of Hellas, a rugged people who compete with the very best of nature, and the very best of civilization. 

##Symposiums

The drinking and making of wine was a staple of Hellenic life, as even the poorest landowners grew grapes and sold wine. The very best wine is drunk in the highest courts of Carthage and Lazica. While the Hellenes made a good wine, they also learned to flavor and sweeten it. 

[Symposiums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symposium), which were held by families of all backgrounds, were often nights where Hellenes drank and laughed. It was a bonding moment for families and communities. While drunkenness was common, Hellenes who could not effectively hold their drink were often derided for lack of self-control when it came to drinking. 

##Sacrifices

Religious festivals, which happened often, were polis-wide events. The Hellenic diet was most bread and vegetables with small amounts of fish. Often, religious festivals consisted of the sacrificing of bulls, and other animals, and the feasting on the meat. After the sacrificial ceremony, the festival took a jovial and lighthearted tone, and it brought poleis together. 

##Epic Poetry

Performed in the great Amphtheatres of Hellas, Epics of the Iliad, the Odyssey, the Dorica, and the Fratricidal war were performed by poets of great talent. Often companies would go from city to city, performing excerpts of these Epics, reminding the Hellenes of their heritage and rich history. 

##Citizenship

Perhaps one of the most important aspects of Hellenic civilization is citizenship to a polis and participation in the defense and health of that particular polis. While most poleis are ruled by kings, or by an oligarchy, some do have more participation by the general landowning population. Property ownership was a big deal, as the polis was responsible for defending that property. Citizens of a polis generally had to the children of at least two citizens. Citizens were expected to own military equipment and join the polis when in a state of war. 

Wealthier citizens often rode horses, or had a full set of armor that included greaves, breastplates, and a large shield. Poorer citizens often only were equipped with bows and light armor. Serving your polis was considered a great honor and privilege, as was defending all of Hellas. More than 2,000 Hellenes from the mainland defended Hellas against the Assyrian threat. 

##The Navy

While the Confederation had by far the largest navy, nearly every polis had a handful of warships to defend itself. The galleys were powered by rowers, which were, most of the time citizens of the polis who volunteered to row to power the defense of the polis. To be a rower on a galley, just like the military, was considered a great honor among men. 


*****************

Hellenes were divided by a lot of things, but the values that they held of honor and duty to serve the polis, to defend the polis is something that permeated all throughout all of Hellas. They were united in these things, and of course the language. ",HistoricalWorldPowers,Pan-Hellenistic Culture,https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWorldPowers/comments/5e4ize/panhellenistic_culture/

Now you will notice that the terrain maps in the sidebar that you must use to calculate modifiers for each region do not exactly line up, that is okay. Do your best. 


A few other notes on population:

* Since this sheet does have its flaws, moderators have the ability to set population to fit the time period. This will only be used to prevent Iberia from have 30 million people in 400 BCE (this happened last season). 

* Moderators who ""fix"" populations will be unbiased and from another region on the map.

The name was to show the two city-states that founded the League. 

Olympia and Delphi are two supremely sacred sites in Hellas. Delphi houses the oracle, and the entire purpose of its citizens is to protect and obey the oracle at Delphi. Olympia is the site of the titanic battle between Hellenes and Dorians. Olympia’s citizens did not build their city on the sacred ground where Hellenes spilt their blood for their homeland. It is here where the **Olympic Games** are held, a series of athletic competitions in which all of Hellas is invited to attend. The athlete seek to honor their ancestors. 


Olympia also houses the most powerful family in Hellas, the House of Atreus. The names of their ancestors, Agamemnon, Menelaus, still permeate Hellenic Culture today. While on the political side of things, the Olympian-Delphian League takes a back seat to the Peloponnesians, the Confederation, and Epirus, they are considered the most sacred and important of the Hellenic alliances. Retribution comes to whoever makes war upon this league from the rest of Hellas up into Amphipolis and as far as Rhodes. Olympians and Delphians’ official diplomatic ties are officially neutral, as they pledge to take no side in Hellenic conflicts. This allows for these cities to be a neutral negotiating ground for all Hellenic internal issues, should they arise. 


While officially neutral, there are quite a few Poleis that do have foreign relations with other Leagues and Confederations, as well as ties overseas. Elis is a major polis, as is Calydon and Patrae.

To the north, two large competing political entities arose, both kingdoms, the Kingdom of Thrace was governed from Amphipolis, an important trading post on the coast. The other kingdom is governed from Pella, which is the seat of power of the Kingdom of Macedonia. 

Moving south, the Thessalonian League dominated the coast. The city-states there defended their lands with a strong navy and a natural choke point at the hot gates. They are subjected to frequent campaigns from the Confederation of Hellas, ruled by Archons.

They include the powerful cities of Argos, Megara, Athens, Thebes, and Corinth. Ruled by a council of Archons from each polis, the Confederation of Hellas competed with two major Leagues for power. 

The next League was directly west of the Confederation of Hellas. The rugged central Hellenes was the heart of Hellas. This League, called the Olympian-Delphian Alliance, dominated the coasts of the Gulf of Corinth and also was home to the most sacred religious sites of the Hellenes.

While sweeping changes occurred, including the installation of Assyrian aristocrats, conscription, and heavy taxes, the King put them to good use. With this influx of wealth, the King, instead of making lavish monuments to himself, started to fund a road program and set the standard for communication. Travel within the Empire’s borders became swift and safe. 

This resulted in a boom of trade and an overall increase in the standard of living. This was not the intended effect. The King of Assyria used the network of roads and routes to increase the efficiency the military could move throughout the Empire. He used it for communication. Assyrian officials would come unannounced very quickly to inspect and collect tribute. This system, where the Assyrians would use the extensive road system to keep a close watch on their subject, led to a serious crackdown on disloyalty. *Any* person suspected of plotting a rebellion was publicly executed. The Empire made an example out of Babylon, where the King ordered the entire population aged 18-21 be slaughtered due to a conspiracy uncovered.

The Assyrians are watching you.
 
While cruel to dissidents, loyal subjects were rewarded with greater autonomy and lower tributes. The Assyrians would protect is subjects in return for their absolute loyalty in war. 
With the Hellenes to the North finally sending a formal declaration of war, the Assyrians called upon their vassals once again to supplement their considerable army.

The Pharaoh overlooked the defenses, and sat in one of his many palaces near the fortifications with his close advisers and concubines. He had utmost confidence in the might of Egypt and his favor with the gods.

Ashur-etil-ilani loaded his 8,000 additional troops and sailed south. His target? Egypt. His troops would land in Egyptian territory west of the wall, and the Pharaoh would be forced to capitulate. 

****************************

As the day came, Sargon gave the signal, the menacing siege towers came into view, and the fight begun. Thousands of arrows rained upon the Assyrian forces, but behind the protection of the towers, and under the protection of their shields, the Assyrians marched on. The tens of towers got to the walls, and the most savage fighting, the largest scale the world had ever seen took place. Thousands were butchered on the walls. The Djerai reserves, with covered battering rams smashed through the gates on the thick walls and poured through the gates.

Athens, Corinth, and Argos rose to prominence, powerful coastal cities that utilized their large navies to control trade. These cities serves as Metropoleis for many colonies all over the Aegean. Megara, Samos, Naxos, Lesbos, and Melos were all prominent and powerful hubs for trade in the Aegean.

Knossos, while never returning to its formal glory, was built back up to dominate the island.

For the Assyrians moved quickly, their Iron weapons, military organization and brutal tactics spread one thing across the region, Fear. It was not long before all of Mesopotamia outside of Sumeria was under Assyrian control. 

##Djerai

And it was the armies of the Assyrians that came in contact with the Djerai and encounters with the city-states there. Offers of surrender from Erek were met with brutal hostility, and Ashurbanipal target Erek as the first of his targets. Its tall walls and access to the sea made it the most well defended city in the region. 

Sieges before the Assyrians were protracted affairs, with an attacking army waiting out the defending. It happened quickly, over the course of a few days, enormous **siege towers**, and**battering rams**, were constructed. Ashurbanipal saw the weakness in his position, and attacked and stormed the city quickly. His forces were met with stiff resistance, but the towers allowed for Assyrian forces to pour onto the walls, and into the city. The gates were smashed in and the city put to the sword. 

Messages were sent to the other cities, to send their leaders to Ashurbanipal, or meet the same fate as Erek.

##Anatolia

The defense of the Byzantines were met with curiousness from the Assyrians, they pushed their domain into central Asia Minor, but the rocky terrain proved difficult for them to transverse. They chose to focus their efforts in the Levant and Near East.

Tiglath Pileser was mortally wounded in the fighting, and the Assyrians withdrew from Sumeria to lick its wounds, but left the small polity in shambles, unable to recover.

Their first warrior priest declared king was Tudiya, who proclaimed himself king of Ashur. Erishum I, a descendent built the temple of Ashur in the late 1900s BCE. Irrelevant to the world, the peoples of this small settlement plugged along.

The people of Ashur, through the centuries came under the domain of multiple peoples, the Amorites, the Babylonians, the Hittites, Hurrians, all did not last. Then came the Sea peoples, and the raiders, burning and pillaging every people on the coast, driving people inland to safety. They brought with them weapons of Iron, and the bountiful banks of the Tigris was now teeming with people who remembered the plight of the Sea Peoples from their ancestors. Shalmaneser, a man who ascended to the throne in 812 BCE set up the framework of the army that would terrorize the world. The lands around Ashur quickly fell, soon, Shalmaneser expanded his domain to encompass the rest of northern Mesopotamia.

It was Tukulti-Ninurta I, the king who succeeded Shalmaneser that propelled the Assyrians onto the world stage. His generals, Tiglath Pileser and Ashurbanipal worked with ruthless efficiency, one pushing southwards to Sumeria, the other towards the Levant.

##**Crete**

As Aegisthes learns of Aetolos' death and the failure of his invasioin, he howled in treachery. He looked to blame every except himself. Screaming to the heavens, to his gods. He marched to the temples, to get an explanation on how they could have failed. As he was lecturing the priestesses, Charax walked in a hurry. His golden armor glinting in the light, he said the salt seas were stormy once again, but his scouts have identified a large fleet coming from the mainland. 

Shocked, Aegisthes shouted to ready the defenses of Knossos, to sound the bells and get ready for battle. Little did he know, landings had been ongoing. Most of Crete was consumed by the wave. But the fleet of ships was led by perhaps the most feared man in all of the Mediterranean. 

Nestor led this fleet. He saw his friend Ajax be betrayed and slaughtered by Minoan scum, and he came, in his sturdy ships to exact revenge. This now was a coordinated invasion. He met up with Odysseus, and they ordered their companions to crush Knossos and burn it to the ground. 

The city, still damaged from the last battle, was still an imposing sight, its high walls and splendor were nothing to be scoffed at, yet Nestor came with a vengeance. Charax led the defense force, now greatly outnumbered. He planned to hold the Hellenes in the docks and let the storm do its work. 

While a sound strategy, the storm became so violent that fighting was impossible. It was as if earth shaking Poseidon was on the side of the Hellenes. Their ships, though damaged, sailed through the carnage, as Zeus' bolts ripped through Minoan ships, and the silver bows of Apollo hailed on the city of Knossos. On the docks, Nestor met Charax in battle, where Charax wounded Nestor with a thrust of his spear to his arm. Aegisthes perished fleeing the island in the storm.

Knossos and the rest of Crete was overrun. Its shrines destroyed and city put ablaze. But what now? The island was in ruins, the center of a great Empire now in the graveyard of history. 

*********************

##**Minoan Anatolia**

In Anatolia, Odysseus led his companions bravely to strike carve out his own kingdom. He could not go back to Ithaca as it was overrun. He brought his troops, and met up with Astyanax. Good friends and companions on the battlefield, they were overjoyed. The two great military minds, along with the instability brought from the Sea Peoples and Trojans, overwhelmed and scattered the Minoan authority. 

But Byzantion, and Sisyphos intervened yet again. Shortly after Odysseus' and Astyanax's victory, they turned around to an attacking Byzantine force. Fighting was fierce, they had just fought with these troops. They knew their strategies and strengths. After weeks of intense fighting, Sisyphos and his forces retreated, unable to break the Hellenes' resolve. 

**************

Charax survived the battle of Knossos. He and his family sailed to Rhodes, to rebuild their lives and to live in peace. 

Nestor was warlord of Knossos before being assassinated by his right hand man. Crete remains in chaos. 

Odysseus and Astyanax carve out a significant domain with relative stability in Anatolia.

The Minoans had fought valiantly, putting a stop the the wave of invaders, the one Odysseus himself led. The mighty Diomedes was slain in the fighting. The elite guard of Knossos, led by the brilliant general Charax, was barely able to throw the Hellenic invaders back to the sea. Odysseus took his contingent and sailed and took refuge on Melos.

Aegisthes, under the supervision of Aetolos, ordered an immediate counter offensive on the mainland. Charax, who had fought on the front lines of the defense of Knossos, pleaded with the king to take more time to regroup. Knossos burned, but wasnt defeated.

But it was not to be. The Minoan might was organized and the fleets sailed to Hellas, to the Peloponnese. Aetolos led the way. 

*******************

##The Peloponnese


Hellas was in chaos. Ajax, who was in command of a large Hellenic contingent in the Peloponnese was organizing the defense of his positions against the Doric invaders, accepting fleeing Hellenes, and doing all he could to stave off the end of the world. Apollo came to him in a dream, with his silver bow, and pointed toward the sea. Apollo then took an arrow from his golden quiver, and strung up his bow and released an arrow towards the Dorians with a loud twang. Great his anger was, the arrow rained down upon the Dorians, and upon Ajax himself. 

He awoke with a start before dawn, and as dawn's rosy red fingers arrived, one of his generals came running to him, Minoan ships were spotted off the shore. Ajax was overjoyed at the prospect of help from his southern neighbors. His joy turned to dismay as they disembarked and started attacking his troops. 

Ajax formed a defensive line around the landing spot when he was flanked by another contingent of Minoans. He and his troops fled inland, only to be ambushed by a large group of Dorians. The arrows flew, the men fought. 

The Minoans, led by Aetolos, were hot in pursuit, and Ajax and Aetolos met on the battlefield. They both drew their swords and charged at each other. Ajax's considerable strength overpower Aetolos, and he was slain. As Ajax turned to return to his men, an arrow flew from the Minoan camp and struck him in the neck, and he crumpled. The Hellenes charged at the Minoans in a fury. The Minoan force, who had seen their leader fall to Hellenic strength, were terrified. As they fled back to their ships to regroup, a Doric force cut them off and cut most of them down. 

Hundreds of Minoans had made the trip from Crete to the Peloponnese, but barely 100 returned, to tell Aegisthes the failure of his attack.

***********************

##Mycenae

The Despot of Byzantion moved to attack Mycenae, hearing rumors of an assault on Crete. He moved to the most powerful entity in Hellas. His intentions were good, but misguided. as he marched through Tionfon, through the Doric lands, he continued to pillage and plunder for supplies. 

He drove more Dorians into Hellas, putting more stain upon the situation in the mainland. As he arrived in the lands of the Myrmidons, he expected to meet the mighty Achilles in battle. He met no one, as the site of his city was abandoned and looted. 

As he moved further south, his army met mild resistance. He stopped and went to Delphi with an armed guard. Through his travels, he saw the destruction he wrought by driving the Dorians into Hellas. He visited the Oracle, who inhaled the fumes of the gods and spoke to him. 

""Go now, for only your destruction lies ahead.""

As he rushed back, he saw his army had been attacked by a large Dorian force. While they survived, the despot of Byzantion decided it was best to go back home, and defend his own lands from the Doric peoples. 

********************

His actions, although seeming small, led to the utter collapse of Mycenae and Ithaca on the Gulf of Corinth. As the Doric wave overcame the defenseless Hellenes, whose men were off at Troy for so long, more pressure was put on the Hellenes to leave the mainland and seek refuge in the Aegean, for which they did.

Two events threw Hellas into the Dark Age, where the Minoan Script was all but abandoned, and the Hellenes forged their great futures. 

Seeing the situation at home, the House of Atreus leaped into action. The heroes they came home with numbered in the hundreds, each worth 10 Dorians. Agamemnon came with his men to Mycenae, and triumphed through the streets of the city. 

The Mycenaeans were ready to battle, Agamemnon walked into his chambers, where his sons and his wife assassinated him, strangling him with cloth. The soldiers all soon scattered, seeing their great leader fall. Menelaus, the Basileus of the Pylian Kingdom rushed to shore up defenses at the Isthmus, when his soldiers slaughtered him and descended into factions. The Dorians swept in, great cities burned and society collapsed. 

The third great king of Hellas, Odysseus, heard of the chaos from his travels to the underworld, and feared for his life. He took his loyal companions and sailed to Knossos, meeting up with great heroes of the Trojan War and other men of Hellas on the way. 

But the Sea peoples spread, they pushed the Hellenes from the mainland, and every major island in the Aegean was flooded with mainlanders. Their society was thrown into chaos. The effect snowballed, and a massive invasion force, fleeing the unstoppable Dorian wave, and the political instability of Mycenae and Pylos, wrought destruction on the Minoans. 

****************

What remained? Dorians and Hellenes spread out, cities fell out of existence, only their ruins remained, relics of a more glorious time.

Writing fell to the wayside as people just scraped by to survive. It was truly a time of darkness. Nothing was there to stop the cycle of violence and warfare.

I also want to note some of the perceived contradictions that happened earlier on when it came to expansions. I made an announcement that expansions were going to be more harshly scrutinized and the criteria I was looking for was the beginnings of a unified state. In this, it is harder for me to approved expansions further away from your mainland because your no longer playing as a people group but hopefully as something with a government. If you are still a people group, I try to take that into account, but the focus is going to be more towards governments for most players.

TL;DR Expansions will be more harshly scrutinized and will probably be denied if you dont have the proper tech, RP, etc.

The House of Atreus asserted itself as the premier power, with Agamemnon being the supreme commander, Nestor, Menelaus, and Ajax did the fighting on the frontlines, leading the Hellenes to many great victories and boundless spoils. The House of Laertes, lead by Odysseus and his son Telemachus, won at the famous battle of Amphipolis, the Hellenic name for the settlement. Diomedes made himself known as a fierce fighter in his own right. The dead he was responsible for piled 10 feet high.

But none could compare to Achilles, who led the Myrmidons. Famously swift, Achilles slaughtered more men than any other Hellene by far. No one dared challenged him in single combat. In the war, it is said he killed enough Tion folk to stop up the mythical Nile River to the South. 

The rise and strength of Achilles worried the other Kings, especially Agamemnon who was worried he might try to usurp his role as Anax Andron, the Lord of all men.

As you may have noticed, this will be the first official slowdown of HWP. We are slowing down from 500 years a week, to 250 per week. With this, I am going to roll out some more standards. 

This is the period in history that the modteam will start reinforcing political unity among your claims. No longer will you be an amorphous ""people group."" We will begin to judge you on how centralized your society is. Seeing as time is going to slow, I expect to see some characters and historical figures *begin* to rise up now. 

Also, all claim types will be able to expand at a rate of two expansions per week, per mod approval. If you have been hit by a crisis, those restrictions still apply.

The King of Mycenae expanded his power by creating a close alliance with the Argives and Corinthians, creating a familial bond. The frequent raids and counter raids upon the Tion had Euboea fall into his real. In the late 1700 BCE, the King of Mycenae, Nestor, was able to negotiate an alliance and familial bond with Laconia. It wasnt long before the power of Mycenae extended to Aetolia, Boeotia, Attica, and Achaea. Soon the towns and palace cities of Pylos, Delphi, Thebes, Aegium, Athens, Megarta, Ithaca, Cephallenia, Zacythnos, Leucas, Patrae, Elis, Aegium, Sparta, Messene, Tegea, and Olympia were connected through trade, culture, or diplomacy. Small leagues and loose alliances sprouted, mostly regional. 

The interconnection of these Hellenes was hardly a tight one, but more of a shifting power balance. Mycenae, with its loyal allies Argos and Corinth, was able to maintain their power through trade, diplomacy, and cultural cohesion with the rest of Hellas. Mycenae and her allies were the only polity that could afford to make envoys across the Aegean, while Ithaca served as the center of power in the Adriatic. 

Raids still occurred, local conflicts were still prevalent, but the scale and size of the raids that Mycenae conducted over the Aegean became expanded. Booty was at a need. Soon the Anax Andron, Ajax now, came to send a ships to Byzantion, to entreat with the King there, to make contact with their Hellenic cousins on the Hellespont.

I hope you liked my cheesey title. But I am here to talk about Claims.

In doing this, I have noticed that a lot of players wish to claim in the same regions, some having major conflict in actual regions. 

I am here to stress that **claims are not definitively first come, first serve.** If two people claim with conflicting territories, it is up to those two players to work out the conflict, if that means trading territory, then fine. I want no bitterness or incivility in this process. 

So here are some good ideas:

* Simply move your claim if it conflicts with another players.

* Come to an agreement to trade land.

or my favorite,

* RP the conflict, make it an event or a conflict to start off the game. Conflicts to start the game will be very much not calculated, but RPed with moderation.

or the Horse's Spring or the sacred Olmeius,

they perform their beautiful, alluring dances

on Helicon's peak. Nimbly they move their feet.

From there they set out, concealed in thick mist,

and travel by night, sending forth their beautiful voices,

praising in hymns aegis-bearing Zeus and Hera

*****************

For the mythic origins of the Hellenes moving across the stars, the order, or kosmos being set in motion, the Hellenes moved across the world as the gods fought above. The mythos of the kosmos and heavens have been set in motion. As the gods fight, the men fight, and as the men fight, they suffer. The gods squabbles are but trivial, and petty, for they have found order in their lives. The men must cooperate. The men must find order to their lives, as the gods have done. 

In Hellas, the Hellenes find their homes, and settle in villages to carve life out for themselves. As the storms rage, the raging thunder, and lighting, they tell their children the story of the world.

*****************

In the very beginning, Chaos, the nothingness out of which the first objects of existence appeared, arose spontaneously. The parthenogenic children of Chaos were Gaia, Eros, Tartarus, Erebus and Nyx.

***********

As the gods come into being, the kosmos is shaped, and as men come to carve their land, the world is shaped. It is in Hellas where I begin this story. As the men come across Hellas, the Hellenic people begin their journey, but it is not with unity that this journey starts, it is with violence. How will the story of the Hellenes be shaped by the tides of history? How far will they stretch? How far will they tumble? Welcome to that story.

The moment you have all been waiting for is approaching, the start of season 2 of HWP. We have been hard at work, and still have to make some changes to the map, and come up with a population system. 

But to start off the season, when the new week begins at 12:00AM GMT, or when /u/AutoModerator posts to signal the start of the new week, is when players will be able to claim. 

**[Only regions on this map, marked in green](http://i.imgur.com/zC6BVLK.png) are open to claim.**

Any claim post from now until the end of Sunday made by players will be considered void. 

Best and I hope you all enjoy the new season!

Back about 2 weeks ago, in the first update of the reset, we announced the claim restrictions, in which we will be restricting areas that people can claim. The regions in the post were very general and ambiguous, and for good reason. At that point the mods had not even decided on the specifics.

There was a lot of debate particularly whether we should just be confined to the River Valleys or not. We settled on a mix of the two. After being on Discord for the better part of 2 weeks, and engaging with the HWP2.0 Community, we decided that we needed to open up more of the world to accommodate you all. 

These restrictions are not based on where civilization started, it is where interest lied in the player base. A balance had to be struck, since the purpose of restricting claims to these regions was to cluster players together in order to build an immersive RP experience, and to prevent isolated claimants that plagued Season 1 of HWP. 

While unfinished (obviously) all the lands that are shaded green will be available to claim in 4000 BCE. More land will come open in 3000 BCE, and in 2500 BCE, etc. 

Here is your [map](http://i.imgur.com/zC6BVLK.png).

**Any claim posts from now on will not be valid. There will be no claiming until mod's sayso.**

It is time to talk about civility on HWP. This community is not only the most successful *powers game, with the longest running season by far, but far and away the most positive and friendly community of the *powers network. 

Saying this, I feel that civility rules and expectations need to be reinforced and gone over. In Season 2 of HWP, the penal system will remain generally the same. The overall rule: ""Don't be a jerk"" will be enforced. If any moderator has to verbally warn a user three times for incivility, he/she will be permabanned from the subreddit. You will be PMed that you have been warned, as well as publicly on the post. 

Incivility includes:

* Any slur of any kind

* Curses at a player in an aggressive manner

* Bullying of any kind

* Meta-gaming

Meta-gaming is something that is treated extremely seriously in HWP, and it will not be tolerated in this season. If any moderator gets a sense that something is done due to meta reasons, then they have the authority to retcon those posts. 

**Each player controls 1 claim at a time, if you are caught using an alt account, it is an immediate perma-ban.**


************

Discord is an amazing tool that allows the community to discuss on a clean instant messaging platform. It will make RPing easier, as well as allowing players to just talk to each other. During this intermediate period between seasons, the moderators of HWP have noticed a lot of incivility and overall inappropriateness on discord. When the new season officially begins, civility rules will be more enforced than before. While this is a great tool to have, it is a privilege, and we need rules there too. 

While the Discord chatroom rules will be ultimately more relaxed than the HWP rules, civility rules still apply there as well, and will be enforced. 

**Be very wary that we have a wide age-range on Discord, ranging from ages 14-mid20s, certain topics for discussion are not appropriate.**",HistoricalWorldPowers,Civility,https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWorldPowers/comments/515ags/civility/

*************

Now for some **announcements!!**

##**Claim Types**

##Sedentary 

General Rules

 * The Agricultural Revolution: Proper RP justification required to Claim; how have your people gone sedentary? Who or what has united them? Etc. Initial posts must be about establishing a sedentary state. This sort of this is covered by most players in their initial Claim anyway, but it will be a nice way to enforce the idea that Sedentary states are a big deal. 

 *  Land to Live Off: One (1) additional territory in your Claim, and one (1) additional Expansion per week. 

Per Relevance

* Knowledge is Power: One (1) additional Agricultural Research is available at all times once Research is allowed. General well-being of sedentary people leads to greater developments. 

* Cities: For each city in the Sedentary nation (Cities must be run be established and documented on a map) an additional 10'000 people may be added to the population sheet. 

* At Moderators discretion, all Sedentary states will be allowed to transform into Nomadic or Thalassocratic states with proper justification and RP. All related rules will apply, and they will no longer benefit from Sedentary rules. 

* In all calculated conflicts, Sedentary claims will get a 1% bonus on infantry.

##Thalassocratic

General Rules

* To Rule the Sea: Thalassocratic States will be limited mostly to coastal/notable river territorys. All expansions that go more than one (1) territory inland will be heavily scrutinized. If a landmass is surrounded on all sides by your state or others you may begin to expand inland without trouble.

* Trade Routes: Trade routes (i.e., relevant locales and nations) must be defined in a weekly trade post. There must be a post on trade routes made once per week, keeping players and mods up to date with your nations trade.

Per Relevance:  

* Colonies: Colonial Expansions will be viewed with less discretion than Sedentary states. Proper ships and justification will be required, but Colonies may be established with much less moderator criticism. 

* Naval Supremacy: One (1) additional Naval Research is available at all times once Research is allowed. A focus on the sea and sea-faring has made the people more eager to develop travel methods. 

* At Moderators discretion, all Thalassocratic states will be allowed to transform into Nomadic or Sedentary states with proper justification and RP. All related rules will apply, and they will no longer benefit from Thalassocratic rules. 

*  In all calculated conflicts, Thalassocratic claims will get a 1% bonus on naval warfare.

##Nomadic

General Rules

* The Great Migration: Migrations may take place one (1) time a week for your nation. At your own discretion, all territories may be moved within range of your own border. 

* The Land Isn't Ours: Nomadic states may only expand up to twenty (20) territories each before Migration. Expansions can then be made into old Migrated lands at the Expansion Moderators approval. 

Per Relevance: 

* Non-Development: Nomadic states take a negative one (1) Research once Research is allowed. For example, if you may Research five things, Nomads may only Research four. 

* At Moderators discretion, all Nomadic states will be allowed to transform into Sedentary or Thalassocratic states with proper justification and RP. All related rules will apply, and they will no longer benefit from Nomadic rules. 

*  In all calculated conflicts, Nomadic claims will get a 1% bonus on cavalry.

******************

##**Wiki Revamp** 

Wiki 4.0 for Season 2 of HWP.

This is your wiki mod, /u/Jmanrocks, and with the reset of HWP, new changes have come around, and the wiki is being involved in these changes. Last season's wiki was a bit of mess, and that was partly my fault, so here, I will be outlining new changes, and doing my best on keeping the wiki organized and clean, while taking in constructive criticism and recommendations.

 1. Wiki Update Enforcement: As /u/pittfan46 outlined in a previous post, your personal wikis will require an update of every 2 weeks or less, to fall in line with inactivity limits. Along with keeping the wiki updated, troops count, population, and tech sheets will be required updated within this time frame as well.

 2. Important Historical Events: To keep track of important history, I've added an ""Important Historical Events"" section to the wiki, to save important things such as important researches, wars, founding of important civilizations, people, etc). In order to get on the section of the wiki, mod discussion will determine whether an event is worthy of being placed there.

 3. Look of Claimed Nations List: The relative look of claimed nations will be the same, except with a minor split of the New World into North America and South America. Also, when adding claims, the format will be flag|nation|border|user. When wanting border map, only maps with your borders only will be added. Overseas territories included. New titles have been put up for continental titles, such as strongest, largest, richest, etc. This was done in order to try and keep the wiki more relevant, active, and make some competition for top spots.

 4. Subreddit Code of Conduct: The Subreddit Code of Conduct will be changed to include the different types of claims, and make few other changes, or possibly make a new section of the wiki for what to do a potential claimant.

 5. Any other changes to the wiki will be minor or if important, shared as things come together.



*************

##**From the Tech Team**

##Starting Techs 

As you all know, Starting Techs were a bit lagging by the end of last season, and players often missed techs within the sprawling list we had by 1700. This season, with the exception of the very first week, we're employing a new formula:  

(Claim Date [negative for BC, positive for AD])-(Years/week)*(Advancement Modifier)= Starting Tech Date  

So if your Starting Tech Date is 3500 BC, you'll have access to everything that was made prior to 3500 BC. This way, as we progress, the Starting Techs progress automatically


Some quick notes below...  

* This formula will be added to the new spreadsheet (population and all) under the Technology section, so no need to worry about typing this in.  

* The Advancement Modifier will function as a counterbalance to the Years/week, but we will also be taking into account how ahead or behind technologically the timeline seems to be compared to IRL. In the early game, this value most likely not exceed 2.0.  

* Non-native crops, materials and methods will not be subject to this formula. Should you acquire an overseas colony containing coffee, or acquire large stores of copper and are unable to work it, you *will* need to research those.  

* This formula is designed to provide older nations with a clear advantage over newer claimants, as they can never even approach the tech from the year they claimed.

*****  

##Legacy Techs  

Another thing that fell through last season (again, my bad guys) were the legacy techs. While late additions were much more expansive in their benefits, we as the mod team wish to make legacy techs much more prevalent.  

Instead of just *five* legacy techs, we're looking to, at minimum, double that number for a total of *ten* legacies. These legacies will be available on the wiki page, and the past civs will be organized by region/continent for ease of access. We'll prioritize those based on the following criteria:  

1. Adaptive/regional technologies. Arid and desert-bound civs will  have qanats and yakhchals on their legacy list because those are necessary for survival. Should they fall well behind the ever-moving Starting Tech line, those techs will become accessible to all.  

2. Core cultural technologies. With the new emphasis on culture and building a more solid history, these will take up the majority of the legacy slots.  

3. Important inventions. If a civilization makes a significant advancement, their successors almost certainly have access to it.  
 
*****

##Tech Trades

Tech trades will see much more scrutiny this time around; RP is everything, and while it does not have to be contained in the post, backround and direct interaction with your neighbors will play into this season's trades.

******

##Prosperity System  

Finally, we're implementing a system for ""prosperity,"" which will be judged after deliberation among us, your beloved tech mods as well as one culture and economy mod. Effectively a golden age, those civs with relatively peaceful and prosperous nations will be entered into a lottery, where they will have the opportunity to earn an extra tech slot after receiving a 10 on a RNG.  

Don't worry if you're RPing a civil war or have RP states that could use some trampling; Prosperity opportunities will be plentiful enough that missing out on week won't be a painful blow.  

*****  

We as the mod team are really going to be emphasizing RP this time around. Last year I trialed having RP prereqs, and due to the positive results I saw, expect some more of that in the future. We're taking *everything* into account when we look into techs.

##**A Preview From the Culture Team**

#Language &amp; Cultural Bases

Language is an important part of culture and thus should be taken into account when one is roleplaying. One of the plethora of reasons that this important is because it gives a feel for how a group of people think, it gives an idea of what their world view is. In Robert Heinlein’s *Stranger in a Strange Land* there is the Martian word *grok* which literally means “to share water,” however, its meaning in speech is more complex. In the Martian culture in the book the word *grok* means “to love,” “to comprehend/understand,” and “to be one with.” These meanings developed from the Martian condition of having water as a valuable commodity. The importance of water in their language helped develop their worldview. When Valentine Michael Smith (the Man from Mars) comes to Earth he interjects his cultural notions into the Earthling culture and starts a shift in thought. Although this is an example from a work of fiction it serves as an apt example of the importance of language. Another such example would be the nadsats in *A Clockwork Orange* Anthony Burgess, which served to demonstrate the dystopian culture shift for the younger generation in the novel. The manner of speech of a culture may further explain why they do something, such as the aforementioned example in *A Stranger in a Strange Land* where drinking water after someone is seen as establishing a strong bond between the two.

Now, how does language factor into a cultural base? That’s a good question. Language serves as a medium of communication and group identity which, in turn, serves as part of the foundation of a culture group. For that reason and the historical spread of the language groupings at this time, a cultural base will exist in areas at the start of the game such as the Lower Danube and Anatolia which shall serve to encourage players to more fully envelop their claims in the game’s world.

Cultural bases form a continuum of the world’s history and should be taken into account. To help with this an evolving cultural map shall be maintained so to assist players in their role plays. When one claims in a cultural area, they should take note of the in game history of the area and see what cultures have existed in the area before the claim as such cultural techs may be diffused to the present population which would affect the way which they live. Religion is an important part of this.

Cultural bases are important but are not the most important aspect of the claim, it cannot be stressed how much of a tool they are for players to use to enrich their stories.

***************

##**From the Economy Team**

One of the new features for this season of /r/HistoricalWorldPowers is the introduction of an economics mechanic. This mechanism is aimed at the promotion of a sense of cosmopolitanism and interconnectedness that is the world. It is also aimed at making sure much of the things you do as a nation are viable.

Among the first aspects that players should know is that bordering claims will have automatic trade between their claims, however, players will need to specify the commodities that they are trading with each other. 

That being said, each nation and their trade will be analyzed on a case by case basis until about either 500 BCE or when a common and regular economic system emerges in the world.

When this happens, claims will have an extra sheet to track the health of their economy. This sheet will contain the following information -  

* A list of all commodities available for trade *from* your nation,

* A list of commodities being traded *into* your nation

* The volume of trade in each commodity with the corresponding trading partner.

These details must be furnished by each claimant in a separate [Trade] post with both or multiple parties engaged in the trade approving the trade deal. These shall be the major variables that shall be used to calculate the health of your economy with a rating ranging from A+, being very healthy, to a C-, being almost bankrupt. Other variables that affect the health of your economy include, but are not limited to, crises, wars, famines and other disasters - natural or manmade. 

Once there is a formal economic system, claimants must also specify the economic system being used, specifically the currencies and how your society views this i.e., whether metals hold a place of importance in your economy, if there are coins and if so, denominations, etc. These too shall play a part in determining the state of your economy. Balance of trade is another important aspect of the economy that you need to be mindful of. An imbalance is the sign of a weaker economy, with more resources entering your borders but less and less leaving them. 

Finally, an important point to note is that the health of your economy is imperative to the functioning of your nation. Any and all actions taken by your nation is dependent on it. Wars, building structures and, especially, exploration is pegged to your economy. In later eras, it may also affect expansions. 

This is still a work in progress. We shall be providing the calculation sheets mostly after 500 BCE. Until then, these are some guidelines for fixing trade with other nations - 

* Tech is separate from trade. One may be able to buy things from another nation without ever knowing how to, say, grow that specific crop.

* The cost of a commodity depends on the distance the buying/selling nation is away from you. The farther they are, the more valuable their goods. 

* Wars can now be fought for purely economical reasons. The loser will be at an economic disadvantage. 

* Any trade partner can decide to cut off trade at any point, leading to corresponding repercussions. 

* All commodities you have need to be justified - through tech research or tech trade or just plain old trade. Anything that doesn’t have a solid basis is just inviting the Wrath of the Elder Gods or the Econ Mods, but hey, at this point, what’s the difference? For more info, check out an upcoming post on the Modes of Production.

##**The New HWP2.0 Map!**

The mods, /u/FallenIslam, /u/Ccnitro, and /u/Laskaka have been hard at work adjusting the map's territories in North America, Europe, and Africa to make the game more balanced. Numerous issues arose due to the many more territories Europe had, America and Africa nonsensical and blocky territories. 

Here are the new territories for North America, Africa, and Europe. Note that this is still very WIP, as the mods will continue to work on the maps into the game as more regions come open.

This is the second update for HWP2.0, if you have not been paying attention, [I revealed details on claiming rules, and areas that would be open to start off](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWorldPowers/comments/4zacdw/hello_hwp_community_this_is_the_first_reveal_for/). While this is official, it is still subject to change. 

One thing I have been considering is shortening the time between 4000 BCE to 3000 BCE to one week, allowing for more of the world to come open more quickly. I know a lot of you like the regions in the 3000 BCE section. 

But onto the topic of the post! New mods!

Introducing the new mods:

##Tech Mods

/u/ccnitro has put together a stellar team of moderators here, and they will be ready for the reset. /u/Eurasianlynx, who has modded before, is rejoining us after a hiatus due to summer work. 

The new face you will see is /u/Ludie_Engmann. 

**/u/Ludie_Engman**: Hi! I'm /u/Ludie_Engmann (Or Ludie for short). I'll be your new tech mod here! I'll try to answer any questions you have for me in the comments or via PM. I'll be helping the mods come up with new mechanics, as well as the obvious: approving tech! I'd consider myself pretty well versed in history, especially in European history, and almost all world history post 1880. I'm hoping to bring new features to make this sub even better, so stay tuned!

##Culture Mods

A brand new mechanic, the mod team had to take a long hard look at a number of people for this role, and what it would entail. 

Your culture team is going to be: /u/blaizi , /u/XeyBlazey, and /u/ComradeMoose

**/u/blaizi**: Hey I'm /u/Blaizi, working alongside /u/XeyBlazey, we're going to implement a culture system. This'll include ways to spread your own nations culture to others, ie cultural ""spheres"" and techs.

My time zone's GMT but feel free to hit me up anytime, I'll respond in and around a few hours.

**/u/XeyBlazey**: Hello, I'm /u/XeyBlazey. Some of you may have known that I was banned over a year ago for misconduct, yet I have changed. I recognized my errors and apologized to the modteam for my conduct. I have a lot of experience with other powers subs, and I am one of the two cultural mods, the other being /u/Blaizi. We have many ideas and mechanics that we wish to implement in this new realm of modding, such as Cultural Spheres, Cultural Technology, etc.

My timezone is CET- Central European Timezone. I'm the resident Euro of the modteam, feel free to ping me for cultural issues if you are also in the timezone, or if no other mod is active. I will attempt to respond in a timely and satisfactory fashion.

I hope that you accept me as a cultural moderator. Here's to a good season two.


**/u/ComradeMoose**: Hey y'all! I'm /u/ComradeMoose and some of you may remember my Gulgean play through. I'll be working with /u/Blaizi and /u/XeyBlazey as we work on a new culture system. I look forward to both playing the game and moderating it.

I'm in the EST zone so there should probably be one of us at any given time. And fun fact about me, I love eating spicy foods that may melt your face off.

##Economy Mods

We are trying to fill this role, and as of now, we have /u/roboutopia and /u/ComradeMoose working on the Economy System.

**/u/Roboutopia:** Hey there! I'm /u/roboutopia. You may all remember me as India before the game's reset. I'm going to be your new economic mod. 

The economic status of your nation decides everything you can and can't do. The economic system is still a work in progress and I'd be happy to get ideas and inputs from you. 

I'm in CET. Feel free to ping me any time you want for any clarifications and I'll try to answer your questions. Looking forward to playing the game with you!

##Conflict Mods

/u/Laskaka will be continuing on as a conflict mod, but he will be joined by /u/comrademoose, who will aid him in running calculations and brainstorming updates. /u/ComradeMoose is quite the jack of all trade amiright? 

***********

/u/FallenIslam will be the official realism moderator, as well as organizing and executing most moderator run crises in the second season. 


***************

**More Announcements**

Other rules that will come into play in HWP2.0, our wiki mod, /u/jmanrocks will be enforcing regular updates to player wikis. The purpose of this is to ensure people have essential information on their wiki, such as tech and population, but also preserving the history and culture of the different nations of HWP. 

**You will be expected to update your wiki every 2 weeks, in accordance to activity standards.**

Over the next week, I will be finalizing claim restrictions, as well as revealing the different mechanics associated with different claim types. 

/u/ccnitro, /u/FallenIslam, and /u/laskaka are hard at work updating the map to fixing the territories in Africa and North America. Europe has been finished. 

**After** this is done, the map will be revealed, and *hopefully* we will be able to be open for claim reservations. Invites for old users will be going out, as we will be reaching out to older players who are still active on reddit. We are also going to ask for your help in gaining new claims for the second season of HWP.

The rise of a tiny Italian Kingdom to worldwide Empire. There are many theories and hypotheses that were thrown around, but the one that this post is about it the discussion on the military expansion of the Empire. 

The story of Rome is often told in three parts, the Regal Period(380 CE-551 CE), the Republic (551 CE-1081 CE), and then the Imperial Period (1085 CE-1759 CE with 4 dynasties). 

While this is a good way to distinguish in forms of government, it does little to tell you when the Romans became the true hegemon of the west. 

From 396 CE - 668 CE, the Kingdom of Gulgea ruled over the Roman Kingdom in the Ligurian Union, with the Emperor able to override the Roman King. While many Roman Nationalists point to this beginning in shame, it was arguably during this period that the Roman people were the most aggressive, and where they made a name for themselves as a military power. 

*******************

With security assured, Rome's King Marcus Saevus (410 CE-435 CE) reached out to the small colony of Thurii, reaching an agreement that gave the Kingdom interests in the area.  King Cassius Dux (440-480 CE) embarked on a campaign to wrest control over the island of Sicily. This was the first major campaign, and it gave the Roman Kingdom power over the region, as they administered most of Central Italy, and the island of Sicily. 

But the Kingdom was not done yet, King Crassus Celer (492 CE-530 CE) also launched a campaign into Southern Italy, destroying the Kingdom of Aldermus, and defeating King Zog of the Albanians. 

These conflicts, while small, provided Rome with dominance over the Italian peninsula. It wasnt until later, under the Republic of Rome, that the true wars happened, on scales never before seen. 

In 601 CE, the Roman Republic declared war upon the Empire of Western Maghreb, an old and very respected naval power in the Mediterranean, over their holdings in Sardinia. The Republic was able to drum up support among the populace, saying that ""no competent nation would allow another Empire to hold land so close to Rome."" In a bitter war, the Romans were able to surprisingly defeat the Empire of West Maghreb, annexing Sardinia into the Republic. It would be less than a century later, in 689 CE that the Republic would declare war on the Kingdom of Aragon, over the island of Corsica. Another old and respected power, the Kingdom of Aragon was the successor to the ancient Empire of Catalunia. Rome was victorious, and annexed the the island of Corsica. 

With the fall of the Kingdom of Hellas into many competing factions, the Roman Republic sponsored a few of those, and went to be embroiled in the Greek's wars. The Republic was embroiled in the war against the Theban League, and the Lebanon-backed Aegean Empire. Over the course of the 700 CE, the Roman Republic slowly, but surely gained control over Hellas in a series of proxy wars, sponsoring their vassal, the Hellenic Republic. The Republic of Lebanon, the ancient super power, backed the Aegean Empire, this would prove to be a spark later in history. 

During these conflicts, the Iberian Empire invaded the Empire of West Maghreb, the Maghrebi people reached out to Rome for aid, and the Romans moved in and crushed the Iberian Empire. 

It is believed that it was at this moment that the Romans truly began to be seen as a credible threat militarily. The Iberian Empire was a powerful state, controlling *all* of Iberia. 

But still, at the moment, there were numerous Empires that were considered far more powerful than the Roman Republic and her allies. The Imazighen was a powerful North African State, the Republic of Lebanon, still a super power, and the Illyrian Empire, who shattered the Kharaangar hordes and whose dominion stretched all across the Danube. 

But by the early 1000s CE, all three of these Empires would cease to exist. The Illyrian Empire collapsed quickly, and Rome gained cleintship of the Illyrian Kingdom, on the coast, nearly immeditately. The Barbary Sultanate of the Imazighen would lose to a war with the Romans, resulting in the Roman annexation of Africa, and the total collapse of the Imazighen. The Republic of Lebanon declared war on the Roman Republic over diplomatic talks broke down. After disastrous defeats in Hellas, the Republic of Lebanon was smashed to pieces from the inside out. 

It was argued, that after these wars, and the beginning of the Imperial Period, that the Roman people were actually a lot less imperialistic. The wars that the Regal Period of Rome conducted, as well as the Old Republic could be classified as aggressive wars for expansion and power. Imperial wars were for influence and maintaining hegemony.

It is your map and expansion mod, /u/pittfan46. And I am here to roll out how the world and how claims will work in the new season of /r/HistoricalWorldPowers in terms of claiming and expanding. 

The rules are fairly familiar, so this post will be mostly explaining the specific changes that will be made from the last season. 

My first announcement is to introduce and unveil the [Discord chatroom](https://discord.gg/tS28pBb), we have a server there named /r/HistoricalWorldPowers. This will be the main chat room HWP uses, and we will not be using KIWIIRC anymore. 



**General things**

HWP time will start in 4000 BCE, and will move 500 years per week until 1500 BCE. 

**Claims**

Claims will be five territories on the map, and you will claim with a ""peoples"" type, which include Sedentary, Nomadic, or Thalassocratic. Each type will have its advantages in time, and you will be asked to shape your initial claims around this type. Details around these claim types will be revealed later.

**Expanding**

You will not be able to expand until 3000 BCE. This is intended to have you focus on your peoples initial culture and background in the days before 3000 BCE. We choose 3000 BCE because that is roughly the time the first river valley civilizations began to spring up. 

After 3000 BCE, you will be able to expand into 1 territory per week.

After 1500 BCE, you will be able to expand into 2 territories per week. 

**Claim Restrictions**

The biggest change to HWP that will happen early on is claiming restrictions to start off. We will be restricting areas of the map that you can claim in to start off so as to combat isolated players claiming, and losing interest. 

In 4000 BCE, the regions open to claim will be:

* Mesopotamia

* The Levant

* The Nile

* Nubia

* The Mediterranean Sea

* The Indian Subcontinent

* East Asia

* Indo-china

* Mesoamerica

In 3,000 BCE, these regions will open up:

* West Africa

* East Africa

* North Africa

* South East Asia

* Southeast Europe

* Western Europe

In 2500 BCE, these regions will open up:

* The Black Sea

* Caucasus Mountains

* Persia

* Yucatan Peninsula/Cental America

In 2000 BCE, the following regions will open up:

* Northern European Plains

* Mississippi River Basin

* California 

**WIP**

* Map adjustments

* Culture system

* Economy System

* Claim types

* New Mod appointments

* Wiki revamp

While most of these systems will remain similar enough for older players to follow, newer ones will require additional moderators to run. 

*********

##**Culture and Economy**

A huge criticism this game had, and rightly so, was the lack of an economic and cultural spread system. Everything was State Sponsored trades, and economies were given a ""meh he's pretty wealthy"" with nothing to back this claim up besides RP. 

To combat this, the existing moderators have been dicsussing systems to use, but to actually put this into practice, we are going to need dedicated moderators to be entrusted with managing these systems, tweaking it, and keeping it updated. 

**We are looking for two moderators for the cultural spread system, and two moderators for the economic system.**

If you are interested, please modmail us (with the topic of ""Economy Moderator"" or ""Culture Moderator"") explaining why you would be a good member of the modteam and why you would be good for this particular task. 

******************

##**Technology**

As many of you know, Tech is difficult to keep on top of, it is a very intensive activity that has to be done weekly for the game to function smoothely. 

Roles would be going over tech each week, supporting other tech mods, providing second opinions on tech. While this part of the game is intensive on the moderator side, the more moderators we have, the less work on average it is per week.

**We are looking for two more tech moderators to aid with going over tech.**

Please Modmail (with the topic of the modmail being ""Tech Mod"", explaining why you would fit for this role. 

For additional information contact /u/Ccnitro  

***************

##**Conflict**

Our Conflict system has been overhauled recently, and /u/laskaka has done an amazing job. But it is only now that I realize that the job is far too much for one person. We need someone who can go over conflicts, the numbers, make judgements, and can be trusted to make calculations, which /u/laskaka uses and will provide for you. You will also be asked to assist him in implementing changes to the conflict system

**We are looking for an additional Conflict Moderator**

If you are interested, please modmail us (with the topic ""Conflict Moderator"") with why you would be a good Conflict moderator. 

For additional information contact /u/laskaka 

********************

##**General Expectations**

General Roles for **all moderators**:

* You are expected to be professional, unbiased, and polite to players when speaking as a moderator. 

* You are expected to enforce the rules of the game, even to other moderators. 

* You are expected to give your opinion on any topic when pinged, as well as **actively participate** in modmail discussions.

***********

**Year 2014**

Mark woke up for school, he lived in the project houses in Rome, next to the great stadium of King Cassius. His family was poor, but at least they lived in the greatest city in the world, steeped in history and tradition. 

He went to the Aventine High School, where he sat in history class, talking of the glory of the old Roman Empire. His eyes glazed over, but he had a paper to do, and this was his topic. 

As he went to the library to work on his paper, he said bye to his girlfriend, Portia as she went to see the football game at the Colloseum. Mark opened his textbook and looked at the map. 

**Roman Empire 1460 AD** it said. Its dominion over all of France and Britain, most of Iberia, and large sections of the Balkans. He wondered how an Empire so powerful could fall so far.

*****************

The Roman Empire by the mid 1750s, was unable to stop the flow of Republicanism. A long and difficult civil war between the Republican Factions and the Imperial Factions removed the Doukids from power, and founded the **United Graeco-Roman Republic**. A Federal Consular Republic made up of four consituent Republics, Italy, Hellas, Macedonia/Thrace, and Western Anatolia. 

The United Republic retained control over the Gibraltar, at least legally, but the small territory gained its own cultural identity closer to Catalonia. Roman control of the straits was wittled down to a large naval base there. 

The colonies of the New world, Antilla Roma, and the New Roman Republic boomed, and declared their independence in 1765, just 10 years after the founding of the United Republic. The United Republic did not lie down, and a 20 year struggle for indpendence ensued, but the colonies won their independence. 

For the New Roman Republic, their system was built on stability and the integration of classes over time. But in Antilla Roma, a strict hierarchical situation led to the country to be poor, divided, and violent. The long fight for the equality of the natives persisted throughout the 1800s. 

**************

The United Republic in Rome still remained the center of power in the Mediterranean, but it was clear that its best days were behind it. 

And what of the Island Territories? Bermuda, stayed part of the United Republic, but the rest of the islands joined together to make the Republic of the Atlantic Ocean, governed from Yashou, these small nations plugged on ever since, coming under and out of the influence of other nations. 


*******

Mark leaned back in his chair, and began to write, on how certain institutions led to the rise to prominence. A small town on the Tiber in central Italy, came to defeat super powers like the Republic of Lebanon, the Imazighen, and the Mongol Hordes. Roman Imperialism in West Africa was shameful to say the least, but Roman influence there had impacted the lives of countless Africans to this day. 

The Roman People, who had risen from a small village to a worldwide empire, the shield of Europe. The Might of Rome should never be tested, lest the wrath of the Legions come down upon the you. 

**********

Mark walked back to his project houses, it was late. He took the long way, through the nice neighborhood, past the road of victories and the Golden Palace, now a museum. As he got to the block of his project, he heard the screaming of domestic issues, the Aventine was not a good neighborhood.

As you can see, the vast majority of people are up for resetting, with a small percentage ""undecided."" So we will begin working on a reset immediately. 


To give you guys an accurate timeline, I will give you a rough timeline for how things are going to work. 

**Week 1**

For the next week, I think that a lot of people will want to write out their epilogue, or the ""fate of their nation."" If you will, to wrap up their stories in HWP. The next week, you all can have a bit of fun to muck around, have your overseas Empire, and wars, alien invasion, apocalypse scenarios, shitpost a bit. 

Over this time, the mods will be working and fine tuning the systems that will be implemented, stickied posts will go up about mod applications, the roles that will be open for applying, and we will be advertising HWP 2.0 on reddit to gain interest.

**Week 3**

The next week, after we have a new mods, we will begin sending out invites for older players. It is during this week we will roll out the new systems that have been in discussion, as well as new rules to old systems---essentially telling you guys how the new game will work.

And so, /r/HistoricalWorldPowers, which lasted from 4000 BC-the 1700s AD, is finally at an end. I have had a lot of fun in this first season, and plan to stay for the second one.

His 17 year reign ended with a massive invasion of Tinko, but it was Romanos who ended the war. 

Romanos Diogenes Doukas was hailed as a hero alongside Agrippa. They had restored order to the Mediterranean. 

While Romanos took most of the credit for the restoration of the Roman vassal in Tinko, his impact was far more important and impactful. He ratified the treaties with Imperial and Royalty Tinko, as well as approved expeditions further down into Africa. 

He approved and reached massive trade deals with Nova Roma, Antilla Roma, the Santee Empire, and the Federation of Manahatta to secure goods from the new world. The luxuries and riches from these nation flowed into the Mediterranean markets. 

**********

But he was tired. Running the Empire was taxing, Republican politicians were always suspicious of the Emperor's dealings. Two times in his reign he had to dissolve the Senate and Tribunal Council and hold new elections, which proved to be a logistical nightmare. Even with his successes, politicians were wary. It did not remain that way, his decision to step galvanized the Roman Citizenry to vote for other political factions. 

The fact that Romanos cited the suspicions of the Republicans as his reason for stepping down angered, and the Roman Nation had the largest election turnout ever. 

The Republican Tribunes and Senators lost many of the elections, as Imperials flowed into the Golden Palace. The Cult of Mars made a comeback, as well as the Catholic Party. 

**************

Romanos selected a successor, Andronikos Komnenos Doukas. He was an accomplished administrator, serving Hellas as Consul for two terms. Approved quickly, Andronikos solidified his position in Rome by appointing Agrippans, Julians, and Claudians as his personal advisors. He sent word for one of the Antillan sons to come to Rome to advise him, a Polonian, and a Pomepeian from New Echota and Nova Roma, respectively. 

Andronikos diversified it further by appointing a Theodisian, a Jewish Thuran family whose influence spread to the Isles in the Far Atlantic. 

These appointments solidified his rule over the expansive colonies and the Empire in the Mediterranean. ",HistoricalWorldPowers,"Romanos Steps Down in 1700, after 26 Years of rule",https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWorldPowers/comments/4xxhyq/romanos_steps_down_in_1700_after_26_years_of_rule/

The Antillans had been gathering their strength. Marcus and his crews had explored the collapsing civilization of the Arawak Confederation. His short visit to Port Royal was eye opening. He read back at his estate of the visit to Rome from the East. From the Chin peoples. He read of the Roman visit to Nippon. 

He saw an immediate threat to his colonies. Before he passed, he charged his two sons with expanding Antilla Roma to new heights. 

The invasions of Roman soldiers on the coasts, that had been mapped out just a few decades, commenced in 1705 CE. Cannonfire from Roman galleons and Carracks, as well as 1,000 Roman Legionaries stormed the shores. The natives who chose to fight were slaughtered and enslaved. Antillans, as well as other wealthy Romans moved in and set up large sugar, and cotton plantations to fill the demand in trans-Atlantic markets. 

His sons, Titus and Lucius Antillus, would move across the coast, settling and seizing control of the land.

It was apparent that the end was near. The Mahicans also got word of how the Wawenock were treated, with Senatorial representation and citizenship, they soon followed suit. The Mahicans obviously were not in a position to negotiate, the Roman-Wawenock coalition marched into their camps with their muskets, and their organization. 

The king of the Mahicans surrendered to Nova Roma, and bequeathed all his territory to the New Republic. 

****************

While the Wawenock joined the Romans, and the Pennacook tribes were but under the boot of the Neo-Roman Republic, the chief of those nations also bequeathed their ancestral lands to the governance of the Republic. 

Wawenock participation in Nova Roman government allowed for a strong preservation of those lands. And so the divide was set. The Natives, taking up the sparsely population, forested inland, and the Romans, populating the coasts of the New Republic. Antonius Pompeius formed a committee on the exact surveying of the land, as well as put through construction project for roads, and settlements to be built and chartered. 

A representative was sent to Manahatta to outline the borders that the Federation would recognize, as the New Roman Republic. The Republic pledged not to challenge or expand any way West if the Federation did not challenge the New Roman Republic's borders.

Reports from the Tinko war said that there were Ottoman commanders, as well as many more tribes further south and East on the same continent. For too long, the Roman's view of Africa constisted of the Maghreb, Tinko, Egypt, and Essinia. 

It was clear now, that Rome had neglected the world of Tinko, and that is what caused this destructive war, the economic collapse that plagued the world. The Emperor knew that he had to become more invested in the world of Tinko to solidify Roman positioning there. 

He was able to get funding for three expeditions in the next decade. The first would go past Imperial Tinko, for obvious reasons, the Romans did not wish to tangle with the Tinkonian Empire, with translators from the Royalty of Tinko, who could guide them in their journey.

The news arrived before the armies. Victory in Tinko, Roman influence and power was restored to the region after a few months of fighting. The Tinkonian Empire was shattered before the might of Rome, and forced to capitulate. 

*Roman Might Reigns Supreme* read the headlines of the *Roman Times*, and the *Athenian Sun*. After many weeks of stiff negotiations, Agrippa arrived in Rome. His ships and armies would march through the city, through the famous Forum, and up through the Road of Victories. An obelisk would be constructed, depicting the victory of the Roman military in the far flung reaches of the world. 

The crowds were fervent, games were held, and a triumph was performed. 

************

##**Imperial Dealings**

With this victory in West Africa, the Romans now found themselves influencing the Viceroyalties and Protectorates of Tinkoni as well. The Imperial Administration began recieving diverse envoys from these territories. It became overwhelming to handle, and the Golden Palace was expanded, as well as the Emperor's personal advisors. 

It also became aware of the seemingly rapid expansion of the Roman colonies in Serica, where Vinland had been annexed by Nova Roma, the Lilacs Isles had been conquered by the Antillans, and a Nipponese colony was discovered.

Before Emperor Romanos Doukas and the Senate, Agrippa presented the [terms for peace, as well as a trade agreement](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWorldPowers/comments/4wi8bj/in_the_great_halls_of_tinko_where_it_all_begun/). The agreement was built on cooperation from the Romans, Royalty Tinko, and Imperial Tinko, with each side being pivotal. The Senate was eager to ratify the trade deal due to the dwindling gold reserves and financial stability of the Empire. It passed with an overwhelming vote. 


*********

##**The New World**

Now, to put it into practice required cooperation from the colonies of Nova Roma, Antilla Roma, and even the Roman controlled Santee Empire. Romanos sent many envoys to each.

At first, the delegations were accepted with glee, the colonies had been cut off for far too long, and had craved a connection with the Empire, but they had enjoyed autonomy. As the envoys presented the decrees by the Roman Empire, new taxes, and trade agreements, they became less hospitable. 

****************

**Antilla Roma**

The first envoy arrived in Antilla Roma, on the island of Antilla. He met with the aristocracy, which consisted of the Antillan family and all its cadet branches. 

Marcus Antillus, now an old man, was overjoyed to see the messenger, but his face dropped when he read over the notes of the quotas the Empire was asking for. 

*This...this is a prepostrous amount of sugar! And rice too? You think we are so prosperous we can fulfill this? And for what? So the Empire can line its pockets with gold I will never see?*

The envoy responded, 

*While the Imperial Administration is fully aware of the scale of these demands, they also have full confidence that you can meet these quotas, do what you can Antillus.*

***********

**Res Publica Nova Romana**

In Nova Roma, the demand for maize and tobacco was met with similar reactions. But the New Republic hastily accepted, a strong Roman Empire was beneficial to their cause. 

********

**Santee Empire**

In New Echota, the Polonians were in a position to pressure to the Grand Quorum to accept a trade deal to export their vast amounts of resources at a reduced price. 

One delegate of the Grand Quorum was quoted as saying on the floor:

*It is a sad day in Santee's proud history, brought to our knees by foreigners, humiliated with this deal.*

***********

**Gorgades, Madierum, Azorus, Yashou, Bermuda**

Perhaps the most pushback the Roman Empire got was from the island territories of the Far Atlantic, who disapproved mightily of the Imperial Roman Navy using their docks, and controlling trade once again. Bermuda, which was considered a haven for corrupted deals, was now regulated. 

The Empire was back, but not without resistance. The new taxes and quotas, as well as the military presence set by the Imperial Administration was seen as a breach on the *Autonomous* status that all Roman colonies now held. The legal argument was difficult to explain, but the Imperial Administration stated that decrees from the Emperor still overrode local governance. Lawsuits from Nova Roma, and Antilla Roma were put through the ringer, and the situation overseas became very tense. 



The Empire ended up accepting 1 representative to be in Rome from each of the colonies, to defend their interests. Although this appeased the colonies somewhat, territories like the Lilac Islands, and the Republic of Vinland demanded a representative of their own. 

Proconsuls were sent to monitor the colonies, and they brought their own personal guard and ships. 

**********************

**To Manahatta**

It was early spring in 1700, after the snows had melted, when a Roman Frigate and 2 Galleons, flanked by 10 Carracks arrived in Manahatta. Aetius, now an old man, was to reach a trade agreement with the Federation of Manahatta, one way or another.

Part of the treaty allows some of the gold mines to land in Royalty-held lands. 

**************

It is through this that Romanos looked at the map of the world, as the Romans know it, and began to ponder the extent of Roman power. 

In Serica, the Romans colonists of the New Republic had struck a deal with the Federation of Manahatta and Vinland. The Republic of Nova Roma had grown exponentially in the last decade. Antilla Roma solidified their hold over the Lilac islands, their production of Rice, Sugars, and Pineapples has made them a key player in the now diverse market that was available to the Roman Empire. The Polonians, in New Echota, played a more hands-off role in their position. The Roman settlers and troops, numbering in the hundreds, settled in the city of New Echota, and through this, Polonius was able to exert his influence over the Santee Empire, or what remained of it. The Grand Quorum passed legislation for numerous Roman-friendly trade deals, for food, the Santee Empire traded the Romans their unique luxuries and goods. 

**************

The Island Republics, Azorus, Gorgades, Yashou, and Madierium, have seen a recent uptick in traffic through there ports as the situation in Tinko stabilized. Bermuda became a hub once again. 

In Tinko, the Royalty of Tinko was friendly to the Roman Empire, they would start exporting their gold, at a reduced rate, to Europe, and the economy would begin to grow as Rome would be able to pay their debts, and really begin functioning yet again. But the Royalty of Tinko also had their own sphere. Vice-Royalties and Protectorates, in the form of the Republic of Yashou, and the Mizrahim were firmly under the Royalty's influence, and thus Rome's influence. 

With this victory, Romanos Doukas moved to reform the government again, the colonies had been essentially independent for decades, and the Empire would assert its control over them yet again.

The Pennacook was put fully under the boot of Roman power.

The Mahicans moved into the dense forests. They had lost the war, but would reorganize. They saw the destructive power that the Romans employed, and how the Wawenock employed them.

The Empire of the Sun has plugged through crisis before, their Imperial Council and Emperor going steady. Ancient policies to preserve and respect the cultural integrity of their people is legendary. 

This changed as nations from the Old World began to settle upon their borders. 

First the Arawak Confederation, one the the three States of the Empire fell into disarray, its cities and islands in chaos. The plague brought by the Antillans and their people devastated Native populations. The political center, despite its best efforts, could not stave off the disease. One way or the other, the disease spread. 

Then the Mayan League to the South ripped itself apart in, with half of the land rebelling against the Empire.

[The introduction of horses and their techniques lead](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWorldPowers/comments/4s8xm3/the_agricultural_revolution/) to an increase in size of population and the population density of the Empire. The traditions of how the Empire was made up was now turned on its head. 

Cities grew, population densities got higher, communication got faster, and with that, another wave of disease and pestilence broke out. This time hitting the core of the Empire. 

Meanwhile, in the South, the inaction of the Empire of the Sun resulted most of the rest of the Mayan League leaving the Empire of the Sun.

The Federation has actually seen a recent boom in population, although the disease makes their nation sparsely population, the Federation has stabilized somewhat.

* Maroon are lands devastated by plague. Population drops in these areas are as high as 30%

* The Arawak Confederation is no more.

Without gold from Tinko, the Mediterranean-Black Currency collapsed. 

While the Romans took measures to slow the collapse, cutting funds for military, cutting taxes, and cutting funding for colonies and letting the colonies be autonomous. A lot of the bloated Adminstration of the Roman Empire was cut back. This, and the influx of silver into the economy, helped marginally, but not enough to halt the collapse. 

Pirates and brigands ran wild throughout the entire Mediterranean. Large scale trading slammed to a halt, and other nations economies crashed. Pirates infested the waters, launching raids on every vulnerable port. 

Nations could not pay for the necessary ships to defend themselves. 

The effect of this politically has already been felt, with the Roman Empire fast on its way to a larger Republic, the Senate and Tribunes curbing the Emperor's powers. 

**********

While this downward spiral of the economy of the Mediterranean seemed to be endless, things did level off. The injection of silver did help, and the plundering of Austrian Gold mines alleviated the Roman economy further. 

The Empire of the Maghreb secured a loan from the Iranians, and within a decade, their vast swath of land stabilized. Trade began to flow again. 

Still though, pirates plagued the seas, and business was very small-scale. 

France, who shared a common currency with the Romans, were hit hard, their military successes in Saxony eased the pain of civil unrest, but their economy still plummeted. 

Catalonia, Bretagne, and Ireland, all being tied politically and economically to France, all suffered as well. The maintainence of their navies and armies was unreasonable, and major cutbacks are necessary. 

Tonuvan expeditions afar are limited, as are their ability to maintain their kingdom. Cutbacks, and major support has happened.

And that interested me in particular, to actually get the prominent families down in a post. So, if anyone cares, here goes. 

I am going to start with the Royal families of Roman politics. All of these families held the title of Emperor and established long lasting Dynasties. The strange thing is that they all ended rather peacefully. There has only been one major civil war in Roman History. A peaceful transition of power is one of the crowning achievements of the Roman Empire, no matter how unlikely it might seem. 

The Royal Families:

* The Julians

* The Flavians

* The Claudians

* The Doukids

* The Romulans

While the first four are Imperial Dynasties, the Romulans were the great Kings of Rome of centuries past. 

All of these families still have seats in the Senate and influence in politics.

The next few families are prominent in the Roman political scene.

* The Cornelians

* The Catonians

* The Agrippans

* The Horatians

* The Fabians

* The Cassians

* The Servillians

* The Tarquinians

* The Lucretians

* The Tullians

Minor Families, that still hold power, and wealth, but are less influential are:

* The Antillans (Well, they own Antilla Roma so I suppose they could be moved to the above category)

* The Pompeians (Same)

* The Polonians (Same---The Polonians moved to New Echota, and have control of the Santee Empire)

* The Sulpicians

* The Verginians

* The Vitellians

* The Minucians

* The Foslians

* The Curtians

* The Menenians

All of these families have sub branches, and have relationships with wealthy Plebeian families. So the waters get muddled when talking about who is who. 

The one of note, is the Pompeians, who transitioned Rome from a Kingdom to a Republic, and who were a prominent player in Republican politics. They now make a return to power in the New World. 

The Polonians, who were always ones of domestic and diplomatic duties, control the Santee Empire, or what is left of it, by having several hundred Roman troops in New Echota, and the loyalty of thousands of Federation troops, and Imperial troops. 

The Antillans are new to the political scene, but their wild investment into the New World is paying off. Their power in the Isles of the Caribbean have set the stage for the future.

Since its initial founding, the New Roman Republic has grown to govern over 1.5 million people. Unlike its southern counterpart, the Republic settled in an area destroyed by disease, there was very little resistance to their settlement, and when the colonist met resistance, they opted for diplomacy rather than conflict. 

It is for this purpose, that the use of slaves is much less pronounced is less on Native/Roman ethnic lines than in Antilla Roma. Most of the produce from this area is lumber, and fish, with the rocky ground not being suitable for farming.

The New Roman Republic's capital is Nova Roma, New Rome (Boston), was the trade and administrative center of the New Republic. The family that was prominent was an older family that fell out of favor centuries earlier but survived. The Pompeian family found their way in the New World, and set up a Republic like their famous Dictator Perpetuo did all those centuries ago. 

I suspect you all know how the government works for now, two elected consuls, selected by elected Tribunes. The Senate is the main governing body that checks the power of the Consul. 

The caveat about the New Republic is that the Senate is exclusive only to Romans. The only political position Natives are eligible for are Tribune of the People. 

With four regions, there are 3 Tribunes per region, and they preside over the People's Assembly of each region, which consists of eligible voters.

The Antillans ruled Antilla Roma, governing from the island of Antilla (Borinquen) from the city called ""Antilla Urbs"" (Modern day San Juan).  

With the fall of the Santee Empire, the Antillan family expanded their influence, and soon their modest venture turned into them governing nearly 2.5 million people. The Patriarch of the Antillan family, Marcus Antillus, ruled him realm with an iron fist. The colony was ruled with a strict hierarchical structure, with Roman colonists on the top, then Native nobles, and then the large slave populations. 

Marcus Antillus and his family, which was large and ancient, all traveled to Serica. Antillus divided the colony into four districts, with the island of Antilla being its own special district. The coastal lands made up one, the Lilac Islands made up another, and the islands East of Antilla made up the 3rd district. 

The island of Taino, which Marcus had just begun his campaigns in, was set to become another district of Antilla Roma. ",HistoricalWorldPowers,The Governance of Antilla Roma,https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWorldPowers/comments/4v76p5/the_governance_of_antilla_roma/

Aetius took the intelligence given to him at its core, and began preparations with his centurions and officers. They studied the [map](http://i.imgur.com/uQtyyPd.jpg) that was provided, using Eagles to signify Roman armies and allies, and Spears to signify the Imperial side. 

There were arguments, heated discussions, and one person nearly assaulted another officer, but the commanders finally came up with a plan, at least an initial plan. 

The situation was considered so dire, so serious that the Romans had to act quickly and decisively to the South.

************

The Romans would muster their forces, keeping the Tonuvan contingent as a garrison at Aksum, and move to the West.

The army would split, two Legions would march to Songhai, to intercept the Imperial Army marching North there. 

They would move with haste, and organize themselves to pepper the Imperial forces with cannonfire from Basilisks, Bombards, and Culverins. 

The 3rd Legion would continue to march West, guided by Royalty scouts inland, As soon as Taghaza was in sight, they would turn and march toward Fashoda. 

As much of the march through these lands were through areas plagued by mutiny, the armies would that they bring peace. Each Legion would bring extra food, and drink to gift to communities to aid them in the war. The Romans promised an end to the fighting swiftly, and a return to peace and prosperity. 

**********

The final phase of Aetius' plan was to wrest control of the seas and crush the Imperial Navy. All Roman-Expeditionary ships, plus 17 Colonial ships would sail south to combat the Imperial Navy. Aetius was so confident in victory, that he outlined what the fleet would do after. The ships would attack coastal Imperial Tinko positions on the shores. 

Ten ships, and the Maghrebi fleet, with Ezekiel's permission, would pursue the Imperial Tinko fleet to the North, trapping and destroying it. 

Southern fleet would consist of:

2 Colonial Galleons, 15 Carracks sailed with the fleet of the Roman Empire, which consisted of 15 Carracks and 5 Galleons. 

The Northern Fleet was a colonial fleet, consisting of 8 Carracks and 2 Galleons. They would be joined by the Maghrebi Fleet if Ezekiel allowed it.

A humble man, the ceremony was not a big event, with only Senators, Tribunes, and a few selected politicians from other States. 

The Newspapers, *The Roman Times*, dubbed it the least illustrious coronation ever. With Romanos crowned, he moved to implement his policy, which is to continue and even expand the expensive war in Tinko, protect Roman coasts from pirate reavers, something that has been done to great effect, and to right the economy. 

The adoption as Silver as the standard seemed to alleviate some of the concerns, but businessmen and merchants soon were able to exploit this in many ways. Other nations were able to exploit this. Romanos proposed a high tariff on all goods that don't originate from Roman controlled lands. He lowered taxes on states to allow them to act more efficiently than the still bloated Imperial Administration does. 

He approved of the mining of the territories in former-Austria, to use slaves to extract what gold that could be extracted. He renewed the Autonomy Act for the colonies from Gibraltar to *Serica*, but grouped them into three separate colonies. The Island Federation of Rome, Antilla Roma, and Res Publica Nova Romana. 

He decreed to get a copy of each colony's system of governance, and major settlements. 

The most important thing he did though, was he loaded up many thousands of Romans, who wished to make a more prosperous life in the new world, onto Galleons, Carracks, and Fluyts, and sent them to the colonies. These ships were gifted to the colonies, since the Roman Empire could not pay to maintain them. They were full of weapons and other technologies from the Empire. By draining excess arms from the Imperial Army and Navy, brigands and pirates were forced to capture Roman Naval ships, or plunder military installations to get quality weapons. 

*******

The Republic of New Rome, receiving these people, and arms, immediately launched an invasion of the northern and Eastern lands to expand their settlements to accommodate the sudden population boom, the former Confederate territory would be incorporated into their Republic. 

Antilla Roma, the ships came as a great relief, and Antillans moved to settle on other islands of the Caribbean. With the end of Santee, and the breakdown of the Arawak Confederation, the outer Lilan islands could not withstand the guns of the Roman ships. The Islands submitted quickly without a fight, and thus were treated with more respect. 

Some of these ships made their way to New Echota, as the Grand Quorum was busy organizing and consolidating the Santee Empire, the Federation's 4,000 troops had routed the rebels in the North West of the Santee Empire.

They had cut back their spending, but the economy was still spiraling. 

With the rise in price of Gold, the currency and value of the other coins of the Roman Empire skyrocketed as well. The Iron Bank of India had offered outrageous deals on a loan to stabilize the Roman economy, and was outright rejected by Roman representatives. Nikephoros put out an Imperial decree to freeze the price of all the coins, and he went into a 2 week joint session with Tribunes and Senate. 

What passed next was thought to be a possible band-aid to the issue, at least for now. The hope is that this change would lead to the stabilization of the currency and the economy in Rome. 

********

Rome would abandon the Gold Standard, in favor of Silver. Silver, found in large quantities in Anatolia and the Aegean islands, would be tapped to stabilize the currency. Price levels would be regulated closely, and the Aurius would take a back seat to the Denarius. The Silver coins were used more commonly anyway, and the scales were set as it was. 

Vast reserves in the Imperial Treasury of Silver, as well as the mines not tapped in Anatolia and the Hellenic Islands would hope to sustain the currency.

The Austrian General Von Staffen had to move further East to avoid Roman suspicions. And that gave the Slavic defense time to maneuver and fortify their position. Roman scouts curiously observed the nation's movements. Generals and Commanders of Rome made comments about the configuration. Among the scouts and soldiers at Fort Venica, they took bets on who would win this conflict. The battle hungry slavs, or the battle hardened, yet tired Austrians. 

The Austrians had just smashed might Saxony in a war, crushing their confidence and forced the Saxons to re-evaluate their position in the world. If such a small, young state could do it, then the Empire must be at risk. 
 
Stark is carving a path of destruction and conquest through the north Balkans. He is a hungry man. 

The commanders all bet on Stark, the commander was renowned for his prowess on the battle field due to its proximity to the Roman frontier. The soldiers mostly bet on the Grand Duchy, who had essentially defeated the Saxon Empire. 

No one was prepared for what happened. Perhaps it was a stroke of luck, or perhaps Stark's plan was sound, but the Slavicians fell upon the Austrians early in the morning, before the army could muster. Stark himself led the assault on the capital, and it was clear, just like that, Austria was defeated. 

The Roman imperial administration was shocked, Austria was a proven nation, Slavicia was not. But now the Emperor and his court would have to pay a little more attention to the new nation of Slavicia.

&gt;It a sad sad state of affairs we’re in. Our relations with the goldmining south has collapsed after that Roman merchant not too long ago passed our prohibited line, and so has all trade stopped. But worry not for our envoys are currently carrying out my words through diplomacy and I expect the gold re-enter the markets within a month.

No gold had been sent, and the central Imperial Bank in Rome was running out of options, without gold to be circulated, the entire system soon collapsed, and not just for Rome. A lot of nations in the Mediterranean relied on the Mediterranean-Black Currency and its stability. The Roman Empire had been hit with crises before, but never a full stop on the supply of precious metals that made business and trade flow in the Mediterranean. Without the steady supply of gold, the TTC had no way of funding vast journeys East and West, the Roman Imperial government had no way of funding journeys to the New World.

The Emperor, Nikephoros Botaneiates Doukas, began massive cuts on Imperial spending, mostly on the bloated Administration of the four states and the Overseas territories. The Roman Navy would be cut in half, with ships spread out manning the Bosporus, Cyprus, Carthage, Crete, Praesidium, Thurii, and Gibraltar. These naval bases were given the priority, with all other major military naval bases being shut down. The ships were sold to the highest bidder or scrapped. This did away with many of the obsolete, high maintenance Galleys of the old navy. 

The Army was next, while fortresses on frontiers were seen as a necessity, the Roman Imperial Government  cut back on spending to preserve internal stability, Nikephoros himself sent statements to the heads of the four states that they would be more autonomous in governing, and Imperial forces would be short. 

The bloated Administration was one that maintained the colonies overseas, and it was soon abolished, every colony was given autonomous status, with the ability to govern themselves as they see fit. 

The colonies reacted differently, the colony of Nova Roma began to aggressively trade with the Vinland Island Chain and the Federation, with the Roman style weapons and ships, their help in their effort was greatly appreciated. 

The Islands of Gorgades, Azorus, Madierum, and Yashou, all united in Yashou under one government, the Republic of the Far Atlantic. Their navy, still significant facilitated small scale trade with the Americas and Europe. 

The Island of Bermuda became its own Republic, governing itself, and still plugging along, being the hub of trade to the Americas. 

Roma Antilla had received seeds of Rice and Sugar just a few months before. Not much changed for this colony, but the governor of the colony did institute Government owned plantations for rice and sugar, and began trading excess crops to the Santee Empire. 

The Imperial Administration looked to take out loans from neighboring nations, but seeing as how tied all the nations of the Mediterranean were to the Roman Empire's economy, this was not an option. 

**********

The TTC's merchant fleet, without the steady supply of gold, collapsed. The Company was unable to finance the facilitation of trade without gold, and many of the ports of the TTC fell out of disuse. All TTC trading posts in the Indian Ocean, Iberia, the Isles, and Northern France were no longer subsidized or maintained and were forced to close down. 

While the TTC kept operations running in the Mediterranean, their merchant fleet was reduced by over 40% and their control over trade lanes were shattered. Independent merchants started to take over. 

*******

Where this left the Roman Empire was in a dire situation, the Gold Standard the Empire ran on was shaken, with Gold skyrocketing in price, the rest of the Currency became as valuable to keep pace, but soon it became apparent that this was not viable. 

The hardest hit nations after Rome were the Empire of the Maghreb, Egypt, France, and Catalonia, all staunch users of the Mediterranean-Black Currency for centuries. Even a quick change to their currency and its standards could not halt the collapse of the merchant class, and economies were in ruin.

With careful planning, Nikephoros Botaneiates Doukas was able to get an addition Minor Legion sent to fortify the northern frontier. The additional 6,000 troops would solidify Italia's integrity on the northern border. Much more importantly, Nikephoros was able to get the funding for the construction of a great fortress, roads, and military bases, and transportation of Arquebuses, Basilisk Cannons, Culverins, and Bombards to the Northern Legion.

While the Duchy of Austria and the Empire of Saxony clashed over the lands of Bavaria, the Romans observed. As they observed the Imperial Administration made some very key decisions that would shape politics in the region. 

*******

**Former Lands of Illyria**

The first decision was to finally get involved in the stability of the Illyrian coast. The end of the Illyrian Kingdom, with the brief rise of the Croat Confederation, and now with the rise of the Kingdom of Zagreb, the Duchy of Bosnia, the Kingdom of Serbia, and the Principality of Montenegro, had happened. Illyria was dead. A reality that a lot of Senators had to get through their minds. Split was no longer the political center of the nation. 

The nations, nearly at constant odds, solved their issues through warfare, not diplomacy. This was not the Roman way, and not the way that they expected these nations to treat themselves. 

Themistocles himself arrived in Split, sending Knights of Jupiter with messages, to arrive in Split to travel to Venice. In Venice, there would be a conference between nations, and stability would be achieved. 

They all came for the might of Rome called upon them. Tomislav III Vojslavič of Serbia, Grigory I Aksentijevič of Montenegro, Nikodim I Rastranevič of Bosnia, and Kasimir V Selmirovič of Zagreb. The men all sat around a table, with Themistocles at the head.

*Your Kingdoms, Duchies, and Principalities used to be united, and united, they were one of the most powerful Empires in the world. Now you squabble over scraps of land, religious difference, petty slights of decades past. Now you are small. I have read the histories of the Illyrian Empire, and their brave stand against the mighty Kharaangar, their sinking of the mighty Polish Empire. You must come to a peace agreement, make arrangements for political marriages, I will not have such a prestigious neighbor be reduced to irrelevance.*

And so it was done. And negotiations began, and they were fierce. Themistocles stepped in, offering solution, resolving conflicts.

And so the alliances and agreements were made. 

The Roman Empire would officially de-recognize the legitimacy of the Habsburgs over Illyria. The Romans would recognize the **United Balkan States**, with Zagreb as its capital, the States would operate under their Royal families.

The King of Zagreb abandoned Protestantism as their state religion, instead promoting it and accepting Catholicism. The King of Zagreb entered into a political marriage with Bosnia, with Bosnia becoming a constituent State under the crown of Zagreb. 

Themistocles had two sons, and they would marry into the Montenegrin Royal family and the Bosnian one as well, solidifying and deterring any hostile relations between the Illyrian nations. 

The Kingdom of Serbia was a bit tricky, but Themistocles' heir married the Serb Princess, and the heir of Serbia married a Montenegrin heiress. 

Overall, the presence of Themistocles, Roman aristocratic marriages, and marriages to each other, as well as concessions, kept the area cohesive.

Each State governed itself, but under a loose alliance, they marched toward goals that would benefit all of their peoples, not just one of them. 

The Monarchs of each Nation would go to Zagreb once every two months, to discuss common goals and assure that peace would remain between the nations. 

***********

**Beyond into the Empire of Bohemia**


Next, Themistocles rode to Balaton, the capital of the Pannonian Kingdom. Pannonia had a proud history, one of the only Kingdoms of the area to have actually defeated the Romans in battle, Yenos V Gastartes was not intimidated by the entourage the Greek brought with him, as he should not have been. 

Yenos V Gastartes and Themistocles of Rome sat and talked, the Slovaks and Serbs had broken away. Themistocles outlined the **United Balkan States** agreement, and told him that subjugating the Serbs was not an option. What was an option though, would be fighting the Slovaks, and subjugating the Principality under his control. If Pannonia made peace with the United Balkan States, they could garner their support to crush their northern neighbors. 

Yenos V Gastartes was hesitant, but agreed to make the effort to ease tensions. He renounced all his claims over Serb lands, and sent an envoy to Zagreb to negotiate a treaty. 

As he drew up this order, Themistocles negotiated selling Culverins, Arqubuses, and Bombards to the Pannonians, enough to transform their powerful army. 

And so, the shape of the region changed once again, by 1655, Pannonia had invaded Slovakia, and the Kingdom of Bohemia-Silesia had come to defense of Slovakia, which prompted a response from the United Balkan States. 

The wars for the Balkans had begun. 

[M] This situation just got real, Rome just dipped their hands into the Balkans. Their alliance building created a bloc of nations friendly to Rome, and on the outer fringes of this bloc, the nations are at war.

Every five years, the Roman Empire holds a competition among nations, one that brings the athletes, and rich of all the nations to Rome to enjoy sport. 

Many connections have been made, and it is what makes the Mediterranean close and aids in stability. Athletes come to do their nation proud, for personal glory, and hope for recognition and maybe a contract afterwards. The Roman Sports League is lucrative for the few athletes that make it. 

The event, held in the Cassian Amphitheater and the Circus Maximus in Rome, far outstrips any international competition in the world. 

The Games, typically held every year, has fallen out of use, due to political instability, and economic downturns of the Empire. But Themistocles, the current Emperor, pushed for the approval of funding for the games to renovate the stadiums in 1640 CE to prepare them for the games in 1650 CE. Construction of great villas, and accommodations in Rome are rebuilt to deal with the influx of people sure to come. 

The political stage is scary, with the Bavarian Conflict in the North, and the Catholic-Norse war in the Far North, but now is the optimal time to hold the games. 

And so invites for the Roman Games were sent out to the following nations:

* The Empire of France

* The Empire of Cyrene and the Maghreb

While the policy of the Roman Empire is that its official languages are Latin and Greek, the reality is, as always, far more complex.

Yes, all major documents, literature, and newspapers are written in Latin and Greek, the classical kind, the reality is that the actual everyday speaking language of the Empire is neither Latin or Greek. In Italy, it isnt Italian, but a blended form of Greek and Latin. While France and Iberia have adopted Spanish, French, and even Catalan as their languages, the Romans have kept their classic roots. 

The influence and unity that the Empire provides has made a new language, that sounds very similar to Latin, but is clearly not Latin. 

The Greek influences are noticeable, and so, people have begun to call this new blended language Greco-Roman. Scholars have begun to recognize it as a distinct language, and writings have sprouted up in it. 

The strangeness of this is that even though it is the same language, when written in Hellas, it is written in the Greek alphabet, and in Italia, it is written in the Latin alphabet. 

*******

While Greco-Roman, the language of the everyday person, has developed over centuries of integration between Hellas and Italy, classical Latin, and Greek is still used to record histories and Annals of the Mediterranean.

The education system in the Empire serves from a very early age and is compulsory through age 13. After this age, boys are expected to either further their education, or work for their families. By age 16, boys can continue to further their education, join the military, or continue working. 

The early schools are simple, underfunded, under-resourced programs all across the Empire. The goal of these early schools is ambitious, make everyone literate in Greek and Latin. In reality, the schools succeed in having everyone learn to speak both languages, and read simple signs in both languages. 

The schools also teach simple arithmetic and history. 

Although these schools are compulsory for every citizen, it is not strictly enforced, still though, the funding and policy of the Roman Empire assures that more people than you would expect are bi-lingual and can read. 

Schools of this kind are in any type of building. Most are in simple churches, but in reality, these schools are run in any space they can find. 


***********

After the compulsory education, most of the population does not go to school, opting to work and make their family money. But of the wealthy merchant class, and the wealthy, they send their kids away to Academies across the Empire. Most stay within their city or province, but some send them to prestigious locations, like the Academy of Athens, or the Academy of Thurii. 

Here, they continue their studies in literature, mathematics, but also shadow government, company mentors who show them what it takes to run a bustling port, and how the government functions. By age 16, the boys are educated in government functions, math, and literacy. When they come of age, they will be eligible to work in government of TTC positions. 

Academies are a bit more official, [run in a villa of a wealthy aristocrat](https://collectingplacesblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/italy-elba-island-villa-romana-delle-grotte-reconstruction.jpg).

The University here is integrated into the city as well, but there are no official buildings for classes, all students are to be assisting or shadowing government officials, farmers, merchants, or TTC officials. Lectures, when they do happen, are in Amphitheaters.

**********

In the Roman Empire, while the government systems varied between states from a kingdom to an oligarchy to Republics, the Imperial level had a complex representation system and a system for elected officials. 

In the Imperial Senate, each state elects 100 senators to go to Rome, along with 25 lifelong members, making a total of 500 members. Each State got the same represenatation. 

In the Imperial Tribunal Council, representation was based on population, with Italia having the most Tribunes, and Anatolia having the least Tribunes. Tribunes are elected to represent the people of the Empire and protect their interests on the Imperial level. 

With this system, the emergence of political factions was inevitable, and their power and influence often fluctuated. Since the representation was equal in the Senate, the factions there often went across state lines. In the Tribunal Council, weirdly enough, factions went across state lines as well.

The main political factions were:

* Cult of Mars- A small faction, but influential. The Cult of Mars has existed in some form for over 1,000 years. They believe that exerting Roman influence militarily is the best way to preserve the Empire. Members of the Cult of Mars are aristocrats who are set to make the most out of conflict.

* The Catholics- A small faction, this faction's goal is to convert the Empire into a Catholic State. Their greatest ambition is to join entry into the Catholic League. They have support in much of Southern Italy and in Hellas. 

* The Imperials- The Imperials are across state lines, in every state, they have a strong grip over the populace. Their slogan is that the Empire provides stability and safety for its inhabitants, and its goals are to preserve the Imperial System as it is, and to maintain and expand the Emperor's powers. It is hard to get anything passed without their support, but it is also hard for them to get anything passed.

* The Republicans- The Imperials main opponent on the political stage, the Republicans are essentially the opposite. They wish to curb and shrink the Emperor's power, and shift governance to elected officials. They too cross state lines. The main issue they have is the representatives from Anatolia, which is a kingdom, are almost all Imperials. 

These four are the main factions who dominate the Imperial stage. There are others, such as the:

* *Seres*- focused on business and trade with Asia in the East and Serica in the West

* The Islamic Fraternity- focused on protecting Muslims in Anatolia from persecution and discrimination from the Empire

* The Jewish Republicans- focused on protecting the rights of Jews, in overseas territories (who receive no represenation), and  in the Empire

* The Gulgean Preservation Movement

An ancient nation, the Romans have dominated the political game of the Mediterranean Sea and beyond for centuries. With this, some of the great monuments of Europe are contained in the Empire, many are still in use. 

Historical landmarks, government buildings, theaters, stadiums, all stand as a testament to the long lasting and still continuing legacy of the Roman Empire.

Although shockingly modern, stepping into the heart of the Empire, you can feel the ancientness of the city. The halls of the buildings still *feel* ancient, yet you know you are standing in the center of the European and Mediterranean world. 

* [The Cassian Amphitheatre](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/forgeofempires/images/b/bb/Colosseum.png/revision/latest?cb=20121229023237), the stadium that was first constructed by King Cassius Dux of Rome. This stadium has been renovated and used throughout history. Its capacity is 75,000 people. 

* [Circus Maximus](http://www.circusmaximus.us/circus3.jpg), constructed by the same King, the Circus maximus can hold over 100,000 people, and has been used for various events throughout history and is still used today. 

* [Roman Forum](https://maitaly.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/forum-uitgelicht_a.jpg), still used as the base of commerce and politics, the Forum is used by the wealthy and working class to meet. It is the most heavily trafficked area in Rome. 

* [Roman Pantheon](http://traveldigg.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Pantheon-Rome-Photo.jpg), converted into a church, the Pantheon holds a special place in Rome's hear. Located on the Forum, this old temple is reminiscent of the old pantheon of Rome. 

* [The Golden Palace](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/09/29/article-1216986-06A1B601000005DC-197_634x336.jpg), the building complex is the residence of the Emperor and his family, as well as the center of government in Rome. All foreign dignitaries are housed here, as well as embassies. The Senate meets here, the Tribunes meet here. 

* [Via Victoriarum](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Vierstroemebrunnen_Piazza_Navona_Rom.jpg), on the road leading up to the Golden Palace, there is a line of Obelisks going through the center of the street.

The closed off Empire of the Sun was a dampener and a huge disappointment, but small scale trading with the people on the mainland, brought its own benefits.

Bermuda was the largest and by far the most heavily traveled hub for Roman trade. The island could accommodate well over 150 ships docked in this port. Being the last big stopping point to Antilla Roma or the Roman holdings in the Federation, Bermuda became famous for its brothels and taverns, having monstrous amounts of alcohol and hookah shipped to the island. 

The Roman lands in the former Federation, in the Bay of Wampanoag, other crops were being grown and shipped to the Empire. Squash, beans, and maize were the main staples for food, and it was shipped back to the Empire, to diversify their diets. But another staple crop made its way back to the Empire and all of Europe.

The first was the abandonment of Javelins. The long used spiculum and Pilum javelins had resulted in many many victories for the Roman Empire's military, but bombards, and hand cannons had been devastating to Roman offensives. Sometimes, the Roman army would win by sheer force of will and numbers, losing up to half of their army to these horrid weapons. 

The development of Arquebuses and Culverins in the Roman army, along with bombards, ushered in a new age for the Roman Legion. 

A Legion would still be made up of 9,000 men, but their equipment would be vastly different from years past. 

* 5,000 Legionaries- Legionaries are now to be armed with Arqeubuses, Gladius Shortswords.

* 3,000 Spearmen- armed with the Menauliun Spears, and Shortswords

* 1,000 Equites- armed with Heavy Lances, and Maces

A Minor Legion would still be made up of 6,000 men, 

* 4,000 Pikemen

* 2,000 Crossbowmen

Each Legion and Minor Legion would have 20 Bombards and 10 Culverins. 

************

The next major thing that was made official is the abandonment of the Galley Fleet of the Roman Navy, for a long time, Dromon dominated the seas, but with the commonality of open sea travel, and the use of bombards, and culverins now aboard ships, the Admares and Imperial Administration began a deliberate and controlled scaling down of the Dromon ships, opting for expanding the Dhow fleet, adding Carracks and Galleons, armed with gunpowder weapons.

Although Rome is a very wealthy Empire, and politically influential, there is a huge divide between the rich and the poor (just like any other nation in this game). The urban poor often live in tenement housing. There arent many options for work for the very poor, they either work on the docks, construction, as servants for the rich, or in the army. It is the poor that often takes on the work of maintaining the vast infrastructure of the Empire. The Empire provides a ration of grain for all logged citizens, with most of the grain being purchased from Crimea, Egypt, and imported from rural States and provinces like Africa, and Macedonia/Thrace.

Schools for all children of citizens are required until age 13. The schools teach basic mathematics, and language. While life can get quite difficult for the poor, they still do find time for leisure. A lot of the poor are veterans, and they spend their time preaching about the mighty battles of the Empire to the masses. The poor of the Empire also take part in small scale Gladiator matches, as well as ukwobol in the narrow alleys of the cities. Gladiator matches are a huge event in Rome, still part of the international Roman Games, as well as their being a Roman Imperial Gladiator League. People from all walks of life go to cheer for their favorite athletes in large Amphitheatres. The landmark Cassian Amphitheatre is by far the most famous and recognizable one, but far larger ones are in Bospor, and Thurii. 

Every citizen is expected to know Latin and Greek, but realistically, Romans often only know one of the two languages, and a very rough and vulgar dialect of the language to boot. 

While most of the Urban population is considered poor, there is a sizeable merchant class. These people own some of the land and tenements, while also own most of the storefronts, taverns, and caravansaries that dot the countryside. These people often man the ships, and handle a lot of small scale trading. 

The Rich of the Empire often own vast tracts of land in the cities, in the countryside, where they own ranches and plantations. While the rich aren’t officially in the business of trading, they’re families are in the government, which does indeed do large scale trading with different states. Togas, everyone's favorite clothing, is ceremonial, the rich of the Empire wear it to formal government sessions and ceremonies (think tuxedos of today in Western Culture).  Most people wear simple pants, and tunics of different materials, mostly wool and cotton. 

The thing that binds Roman culture is their love of poetry, the old epics of the Covenant, the wars and times of past are performed in Amphitheatres, accompanied by foreign musicians of all walks of life. Their love of ceremonies, even though 99% of the population has abandoned the old pantheons, is strong. They revere the ceremonies to Mars, and Jupiter at the games and before battles. The old traditions are strong. The love of athletic competition, there are stories and epics of famous gladiators and athletes, and hundreds of thousands of people go to athletic matches every year. Accompanying this love of sports, is the fabulous drinking culture that the Empire has. The Roman Empire has a wide array of alcoholic beverages that are served at taverns and caravansaries. While grape wine is the most commonly consumed beverage, taverns also serve whiskey, vodka, beer, straw wine, palm wine, cider, perry cider, and mead. 

In the cities, bathing in bathhouses is something everyone did everyday, while the rich had their own private bath houses that they used, their are hundreds of public baths that the poor are able to utilize. 

One of the biggest pride that Romans have is the large amount of its citizens that are indeed landowners. Most of the farming in the Empire is done by families, with vast tracts of land interspersed in between. The backbone of the Empire are these farmers, rough people, and one's dedicated to the preservation of their position in society. 

While most farmers are not very wealthy, the Imperial Administration takes care of them, helping them out with manning their farms by selling them slaves at a discounted rate, and buying their surplus of crops for above the market price. 

Farmers are more religious than any other part of the Empire, with each farming community having its own church and priest. 

***********

**Religion**

The diverse religious makeup of the Roman Empire would make you think that the Empire would be tearing itself to shreds, but the nature of the governance that the Empire employs, with four states and autonomous provinces, allows for different faiths to thrive with little conflict. While religious disputes happen, they often dont result in full scale war. 

This is because the State lines are drawn to respect the areas faiths. The most diverse state religiously is actually Macedonian/Thrace, where nearly half the population is Orthodox Christian and the other half is Catholic.

His appointment of Themistocles of Athens, who adopted the Julian name, was the first man from outside of Italia to be Emperor since Constantine of Russia.

As of 1600, there are five Overseas Territories of the Roman Empire. These territories are not part of the four states gone over in previous posts and they are governed directly by the Imperial Administration. 

But there are people living in these areas, and they are vastly different culturally from the rest of the Empire and even each other. 

* The Strait of Gibraltar: The largest and most populous overseas territory by far, Gibraltar is made up of 
two strips of land, one in Iberia, and one in Africa. nearly half a million people live on the straits, about half of them Romans, the other half are Jews of the Maghreb and Jews of Iberia. 

* Azorus: A small island chain in the Far Atlantic Ocean, Azorus only has about 35,000 people living on all the islands combined. The Jewish Republic of Yashou originally colonized the islands, but as of now, the island is 48% Roman and 52% Jewish. 

* Madierum: The largest Island, with about 45,000 people living on it, Madierum is also an island colonized by the Jewish Republic of Yashou. Romans make up about 13,000 of the population, with the rest being Yashouan. 

* Gorgades Isles: The furthest and most out of way of the overseas territories to date, the Gorgades Isles were also colonized by the Jewish Republic of Yashou. The population is about 32,000 inhabitants, with about 12,000 of them being Romans. 

* Bermuda Island Chain: The furthest and most different of the overseas territories, Bermuda has about 15,000 inhabitants. It used to be part of the Santee Empire, but because of the plagues, the island was not governed by the Celestial Empire, it was self governing, and its population dwindled to under 4,000. But with TTC investment, and Roman colonization, the natives and Roman population expanded the population by nearly 4 times. Natives still make up the majority, totaling 12,000 inhabitants. The rest are Roman colonists. While the permanent population is low, the infrastructure and harbors can accommodate up to 35,000 people for periods at a time

**Economy**

The Economy is really the same for all of the overseas territories, a lot of the land is not useful for mass production, so the islands make their money being natural stopping points for the TTC. In fact, the TTC is the driver of economic gain for these islands. The Gorgades Isles is home to a large TTC stronghold. Voyages to the continent of *Serica* always stop in Gibraltar, Madierum, and Azorus. 

Voyages down the coast to West Africa stopped in the Gorgades Isles. 

By far the strongest economy is probably Bermuda's. The markets are legendary and it is the headquarters of the TTC, being ample distance from the Caribbean and Federation of Nations. Goods from the Santee, Federation, and Caribbean are sold and traded here.

**Government**

The islands were governed by the Imperial Administration. Although they each had a representative in Rome, the territories were subject to the Imperial Administration's decisions, in that the Emperor could intervene directly in their lands. The Emperor, appointed Roman proconsuls to govern these territories.

The Romans had made the island their own. Roman colonists had flooded the island. Wealthy TTC merchants, aristocrats, and even ordinary people went to settle on the island. The increased traffic had the Romans build ports, shipyards, warehouses, markets, amphitheaters, roads, and all the luxuries of Roman life. 

The population of Romans and natives blended together. The natives eager to be relevant to a mighty Empire once again, abandoned by the Santee in their times of plague and disorder. 

The Bermuda-natives soon started to lobby to gain full protection from the Roman Empire, as ships from the Santee, and reports of the Empire of the Sun seizing control of the Lilan islands only solidified the need for the Romans to incorporate Bermuda as a base of operations for Naval interference in the New World. 

And so, Bermuda was incorporated into the Roman Empire as an Overseas Territory. 

The Reports of the Empire of the Sun's ships approaching the Lilan islands alarmed the TTC. Their fleet in the area was mostly Caravels and Carracks, but they mustered a small fleet themselves and moved to protect the Lilac islands against possible attacks from the Empire of the Sun. 

With this, the Senate and Tribunal Council approved a commission of 10 Galleons and 35 Carracks to be sent to the Overseas Territories to cement Roman control over Bermuda, and begin to explore the other islands, near the Southern tip of Santee and the Empire of the Sun.

Anatolia has been a landmass that has been ruled by many nations over the centuries, including the Ottomans Turks, Seljuks, the Dharjans, the Propontic peoples, the Lebanese, Pisidians, and the Cappadocians. The northern and Western portions of Anatolia are unmistakably Greek and Roman in culture. The State of Anatolia held jurisdiction over the Central, Southern, and Eastern portions of Anatolia. The population, just about 4 million strong, was nearly completely Muslim, with only a few hundred thousand following other religions. 

The people were tough, and craved security, which is something the Roman Empire provided them. 

**Economy**

Because of the rugged terrain and violent past, the State of Anatolia is rather poor economically. Most of its inhabitants make their living off of farming, while a few are businessmen. It's greatest asset, is that it is the frontier of the Roman Empire, which often approves a lot of funding for infrastructure projects. Its close proximity with Neo-Lebanon, the Colchis, and Iran make it an ideal trading partner further East. 

If only the Near East stabilized...

**Government**

Anatolia is ruled by a King, the King of Cappadocia is a vassal of Rome. His domain extended a bit past the borders of the Roman Empire. 

The King uses the provinces for administration the Empire provided for him, with bureaucrats aiding in administering the State. He holds a council of 15 members, who come from the wealthy of each province, and advise him on matters that pertain to him.

The last two States, Italia and Hellas, were pretty diverse in their populations and territories. It is a bit different with Macedonia and Thrace (M/T). The State of Macedonia and Thrace is situated just north of Hellas, stretching from the Adriatic Sea to the Bosporus. They have coasts on the Aegean Sea, Black Sea, and the Adriatic Sea. 

The population of M/T is just under 6.5 million inhabitants. The population is mostly comprised of Greeks, Macedonians, and Thracians. The region was ruled by the Knights of Jupiter, which allowed many different kinds of peoples to migrate and settle, which makes M/T, in stereotypes, a bit more *rough* than the rest of the Empire. Culturally, M/T is barely distinguishable from the rest of the Empire, adopting the Greco-Roman way of life in language and culture. The only notable difference is that nearly 2.5 million Macedonians and Thracians are Orthodox Christians.

**Economy**

Even with its great population, and its relatively good location, the economy M/T is rather weak. Most of its inhabitants are farmers, who tend the fields and have to toil to survive. It held only two usable ports, and that is where most of its commerce comes from. 

The exports that M/T does have is timber, a lot of the wood for ships comes from this region, so a lot of the work is due to hard labor. 

The University at Sofia though, was perhaps the best in the Empire, with the presence of the Knights of Jupiter. It is where the brightest scholars and politicians go to study. 

**Government**

M/T government is radically different from the Republican system Hellas and Italia run. While they still consider themselves a Republic, it is a very thinly veiled oligarchy. M/T is split into two provinces, Macedonia in the West, and Thracia in the East. Each of these provinces have 50 Senators that go to Sofia, the capital. 

The Senators select a *Dux*, who sets State policy, and his term is for life. 

Every act by the Dux must be approved by the M/T Senate with 66% of the vote, and at least 50% of each Macedonian Senators and Thracian Senators. So if the Dux enacts a policy, and all 50 Macedonian Senators vote yes, but only 24 Thracian Senators vote yes, then his policy is vetoed. This makes it so the Dux must satisfy both parties sufficiently.

The State of Hellas is the second most populous, and is far more spread out, incorporating Cyprus, Crete, and all of Pontus in its borders. To its north, the State of Hellas is bordered by the State of Macedonia and Thrace, and to its East, the State of Anatolia. It has coastline in both the Mediterranean and Black Seas, controlling half of the Bosporus Strait. 

The State of Hellas has over 5.5 Million inhabitants. Most of these people are Catholic, but in the provinces of Pontus, and Ionia, 1.5 million Muslims live. About 500,000 people follow the Grattic and Old pagan faiths, mostly concentrated in Cyprus and Crete. 


**Economy**

The State of Hellas, to put it simply, is integral for the economy of the Roman Empire. It is ideally situated next to the Aegean Sea, with holdings very close to the Levant. From the State of Hellas, you can get to every nation on the coast of the Near East extremely quickly. The Economy is booming due to international trade with Judea, Egypt(not so much anymore), the Maghreb, Neo Lebanon, and Romania. Being far more rocky, the State of Hellas relies on the more fertile lands of coastal Maghreb, the Crimean Republic, Pontus and Ionia to maintain its large cities. The mountainous regions of Hellas make it ideal for growing olives, and its climate makes ideal for growing wine. Other goods included figs, honey, and cheese. 

Like Italia, there are a large amount of fisherman in Hellas.

**Government**

Also an elected Republic, the main difference is that the provinces in Hellas consisted of three autonomous provinces instead of two. How Hellas treats its autonomous provinces is vastly different. In return for their autonomous nature, the provinces are given far less representation on the Tribunal Council of Hellas. This is mostly because the populations of the autonomous provinces are far smaller than the normal provinces, where most of the people live.

The three autonomous provinces of Hellas are Cyprus, Crete, and Rhodes.

The State of Italia is the largest and most diverse State of the Roman Empire. Its population soars over 9 million inhabitants, and it spans from the Alps to the lands of Carthage in Africa. 

Ethnically, Italia is made up of three major ethnic groups, Gulgeans of Northern Italy, Romans of Italy/Islands, and Ponii of Africa. 

A little more than 8 Million of the inhabitants of Italia are Catholic. 1 Million of the inhabitants are Faryabans, concentrated in the mountainous north. The other half a million are various other faiths, Old Hellenistic Pagans, Grattics, Jews, and Muslims interspersed throughout the State. 


**Economy**

The State of Italia's economy is the strongest of the Empire, housing the seat of the Imperial Administration and the TTC. Italia, in conjunction with the TTC, controls all major trade lanes in the Mediterranean Sea.

Most Romans in Italia make their living in farming, the fertile lands in Africa and Italy are ideal for grain, grapes, legumes, and other crops. Africa is the ""breadbasket"" of Italia, maintaining the city of Rome, the capital of the State and of the Empire. The mountainous north and spine of Italia made it easy to grow olives, which was a huge export of Italia. Fishing was a common pratice, with the lush and mostly safe shores, the Garum fish sauce was coveted far and wide.

As the center of the Catholic Church, Italia also receives a lot of tourism, with hundreds of thousands of visitors visiting Rome to see the Pope's small town outside of Rome. Every five years, the Roman Games, which is an international competition is held in Rome. Participants from Cyrene, Saxony, Russia, France, Aragon and all other nations and States have taken part. It is a huge deal with the Cassian Amphitheater holding 75,000 spectators and the Circus Maximus holding over 150,000 spectators.

**Government**

The State of Italia is run with an Elected Republic, with a Senate and an Assembly of Tribunes. 10 Senators from each province are sent to Rome every 5 years, and the Tribunes are elected every 5 years, the number proportional to the population of the province.

The State is made up of 9 provinces, with two of them being autonomous regions. The two autonomous regions are Gaeglia and Thurii, where the TTC rules. The two autonomous regions run themselves, due to the TTC and the large Faryaban population, which utilizes the Bacada Script as well as Latin. 

The Tribunes elect the 2 Consuls, and 4 Praetors who in turn appoint their personal staff. The Senate must approve of these appointments. 

The Consuls and Praetors set domestic policy, while the Tribunes and Senators vote on these matters. 

The Autonomous Regions are allowed to govern themselves, with checks on the State Government's power that bars them from interfering in public works and regulations on the TTC.

With the integration of Anatolia, the Emperor of Rome pushed through many reforms for the government. While many of these reforms were meant to Romanize and make Anatolia Roman, they had a different effect. 

Not wanting to alienate the conquered peoples of Cappadocia, the Emperor Julius passed instituted a number of reforms, expanding the Senate to 500 members, 100 aristocrats, and 400 elected officials. The Tribunal Council was expanded as well, to accommodate the growing amount of people under the jurisdiction of the Empire. 

While Julius' overarching goals failed, his policy was instrumental on making Anatolia feel integral to the Roman Empire, and linking up the rest of the Empire through roads, aqueducts, institutions, and language. Greek and Latin became the official language of administration and commerce. 

With Julius' death, his brother, Antonius, took the reigns as Emperor and instituted more reforms to compensate for the failed Romanization projects of Julius. 

************

The first one is he broke the Empire up into four constituent States. Each State had its own provinces, which aligned with the previous provincial system. For example, the State of Hellas had the provinces of Hellas, Crete, Cyrpus, Ionia, Pontus, and Rhodes. More on this later.

* The ability to declare war.

* The maintenance and expanding of infrastructure

* Supreme Commander of the Navy and the Army

* Representing the Empire to foreign powers

* Approval of Senators of the Aristocratic Class

* The ability to dissolve the Senate or Tribunal Council, in which elections will be held

##**Senate**

Each State provided 25 lifelong members to the Senate, and 100 elected Senators to the Senate, who serve terms of 10 years.

 
The point of this was that each State got equal representation in the Senate. 

The Powers of the Senate were expanded greatly to:

* Approval of Tax Levels

* Approval to send troops/how many troops

* Approval of the successor to the Emperor

##**Tribunal Council**

Three Tribunes are elected per region (every region on the map) for a total of 444 Tribunes:

The State of Macedonia and Thrace has 72 Tribunes

The State of Italia has 201 Tribunes

The State of Hellas has 111 Tribunes

The State of Anatolia has 60 Tribunes 

The Tribunes are elected every five years, and are meant to represent the will of the diverse people and population of the Empire. By being from every region, every possible community is represented in some capacity. The larger the State, the larger the amount of Tribunes representing that State are. Italia has the largest population, and probably the most diverse population, with Faryaban Gulgeans, Punic Africans, Corsicans, Sicilians, etc living in their State, so they receive the most Tribunes. 

Tribunes must:

* Approve the Senate's troop numbers per war

* Allocate levying responsibilities for each State (ie Italia must raise two legions, Hellas one legion, etc)

* Approve of the Emperor's appointment of Consuls, Praetors, Imperators, and Admares

* In charge of tax collection

********

Approval is a simple majority of votes in sessions, the Emperor is the deciding vote if there is a deadlock in voting. 

********

##**Provinces**

While the States are mostly self governing each State is broken up into provinces that are recognized on the Imperial Level. While it is optional for States to use, the easiness of having a universal provincial system is beneficial for all. 

As it stands right now, there are no border conflicts between States and Provinces, in that, no province is split into two separate States. The closest case is in Anatolia, where Ionia and Pontus are part of the State of Hellas, while the rest of Anatolia is part of the State of Anatolia. This is because of the ethnic, cultural, and religious differences. 

**State of Italia**

* Roma

* Aldermus

* Africa

* Sicily

* Thurii

* Venica

* Liguria

* Sardinia et Corsicana

* Gaeglia

**State of Hellas**

* Hellas

* Crete

* Rhodes

* Cyprus

* Pontus

* Ionia

**State of Macedonia and Thrace**

* Thracia

* Macedonia

**State of Anatolia**

* Asia

* Cappadocia

* Cilicia

* Galatia

Provinces are used for State governments, which operate as Republics, with varying degrees of difference. [M] Will do posts on these later [M]

##**Overseas Territories**

The last category are overseas territories. These territories are part of the Roman Empire, but are not organized into States, and are instead governed by the Emperor, who appoints Proconsuls to manage them (Approved by the Tribunal Council). 

The overseas territories are:

* The Strait of Gibraltar

* The Azorus Islands

* Madierum

* Gorgades Islands

They were subject to laws of the Imperial Administration, but had certain protections from the Empire. As States, they had their own laws that fell in line with their local culture and customs. Certain things, like tax levels, infrastructure, language, currency, and military structure were standardized, the rest was left up to the states. 

********

The other category is called **overseas territories**, which are ruled directly by the Imperial Administration. The only land in this category was the strait of Gibraltar, two small patches of land in Iberia and the Maghreb, until now. 

The [Emperor Julius](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWorldPowers/comments/4llaw9/roman_colonists/) started Roman colonization, while also going into heated negotiations with the Doge of the Jewish Republic of Yashou, along with the TTC. Roman Colonists could travel to the Azores, Madiera and Cape Verde in return for Jewish Yashouan citizen given full travel and trade rights with the Roman Empire. 

Thousands of Roman colonists, a mix of poor and rich, moved out to these islands. The Jews of these islands, seeking better land, had three options, move into the Roman Empire's lands, the Maghreb Empire's lands, or even Judea's lands. While some did, quite a few of them remained, and Roman colonists blended with the population, bringing their ships, weapons, infrastructure, and most importantly, wealth to the islands. 

Before long, the Imperial Administration approved of three more **overseas territories**, Azorus, Madierum, and Gorgades isles.

To be fair, I have been running a Crisis, and RPing a war in the Near East, but still, no excuse. [M]


Perhaps Julius Aurelius Constantinus Augustus' most impactful policy was his worst one. His [effort to Romanize](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWorldPowers/comments/4kleyd/projects_of_romanization/) the diverse regions of the Empire had failed miserably, and caused a lot of unrest, especially in Anatolia. The projects were expensive too, it became a money pit for the Empire, and the projects were stopped essentially at his death in 1599. 

The effects were not all bad. By attempting to standardize what it meant to be Roman across the ""core territories"" of the Empire, Julius had brought Romans to Anatolia, infrastructure, city structure, and Roman culture to where it hadnt existed before. At first, while the project was underway, it clashed horribly with the native populations, but as the effort from the Imperial Administration relaxed, the cities and communities of the Empire retained their identity, while reaping the benefits of infrastructure, and governing structure. The most important project that was standardized was language, with Greek and Latin being made the official language, it made Roman administrators, and Anatolian nobles able to communicate anywhere in the Empire.

********

Antonius Pius, Julius' brother, took the reigns in 1600. he took a far more relaxed approach to this standardization, which appeased the native peoples that had felt displaced. Their language and culture wasnt pushed out, but was encouraged to co-exist with the Romans and Greeks that migrated to these areas. 

He saw the need to give the core territories a bit of autonomy, but bound them to the Imperial Administration. He spoke for hours to the Senate and Tribunal Council, hammering out systems of governance, and borders of the divisions of governance. 

The Roman Empire would be made up of four States, ruled by the Imperial Administration, but governing internally as they like. The States would be governed as Republics:

* The State of Italia

* The State of Hellas

* The State of Anatolia

* The State of Macedonia and Thrace

Overseas Colonies: Gibraltar

For most of Roman history, this was fine, as long as their world was stable.

With the dominance of the TTC in far reaching waters, employment for them became a possibility, even the very poor could sign up to become ship hands, and marines for the TTC. 

But in 1599 CE, there was a major policy shift of the TTC, in which they were offering up opportunities for a new life abroad. This had been done before, the Republic of Vinland had a large amount of Romans, and even a Catholic Church, living on the island chain. But the TTC and more importantly, the Roman Emperor, began to sponsor and approve funding for colonizing efforts to the islands of the Far Atlantic. 

It was in Gibraltar that the Emperor of Rome, Julius Aurelius Constantinus Augustus, now an old man, met the Doge of the Jewish Republic. This meeting discussed the very nature and state of the Republic, and the two men signed a treaty. 

The Jewish Republic became a vassal of Rome, the Roman Empire would be able to colonize and administrate the Azores, Cape Verde, and Madiera, but would leave Yashou and the West African lands of the Republic free from Roman colonization. 

In return, the Jewish Republic would have full travel and working rights throughout the Roman Empire. 

*************


Apart from the islands in the Far Atlantic, the unincorporated lands of the Federation of Manahatta were ripe for colonists. More so sponsored by the TTC and the Republic of Vinland, colonists of Roman descent would settle in the northern reaches to the Bay of Wampanoag in the Federation. Bands of Romans, up to 200 would settle and start making communities in these unincorporated lands. The lands were mostly deserted, but a skirmish with the natives here and there, as well as some fruitful alliances  aided the Romans in setting up sustainable colonies in these areas.

The Republic of Vinland made the Chief Minister, as well as the Assembly and Delegation of Nations aware of this practice.

But with the popularity of sea-faring vessels, which had always been an integral part of the Roman Navy, growing, the Dromon made less sense. 

The introduction of Galleons, Carracks, and Caravels, as well as the bombard cannon mounted on these ships saw Admirals and Imperial administrators go through a massive change in Naval philosophy. The Dromon were seen as a liability, with enormous manpower needed to power the ships, as well as limited flexibility on the open water.

The lands of Nubia and Kush, integrated into Egypt and the Ottoman Caliphate, a proud land, and a rough people. The Kushites and Nubians, as well as their allies in Vishanti had seen so much war. They received none of the wealth from the Caliphate or IOC dealings. The people fought for the Caliph, but received poor land and compensation.

No more, they would be free, free from their oppressors. 

The Ottomans had amassed a huge armie, 25,000 men marched south, with their bombards and their guns. They went to besiege Napata, the proclaimed capital of the Kushite Kingdom. 

The rebels, under Senkamanisken and Aramatle-qo, rose a considerable 15,000 man army, aided by 4,000 South Cyreneans, and 10,000 Maghebi Mercenaries. 

4,000 South Cyreneans guarded the south, with an additional 2,000 Vishanti, dwelling in the harsh Ethiopian Highlands. 

**********

It was dawn, and the Ottomans had marched far enough South to see the city of Napata. Very quickly, the trumpet sounded, the rebels had come out to attack them. They lines quickly moved up. 

Aramatle-qo stacked the center of his lines with Magrebi Hoplites, and used captured Egyptian Bombards to pepper the Ottoman lines. The surprising offensive caught the Ottoman army off guard, they depserately moved to meet the lines of the rebels. The weary and tired men met the Kushite force. Being better trained, it seemed the Ottomans would succeed, but the South Cyrenean and Maghrebi Camel warriors assaulted the flanks in well-synchronized strikes, tossing the men aside and crushing their hope. 

The battle lasted a few hours, and over 1,000 Ottomans lay dead by the end of the battle. 

The Ottoman generals had to reassess their strategy as they retreated north, knowing now that the Maghreb Empire was a aiding in the revolution. But there was not time for that, as they were in enemy territory, and guerrilla fighters and more Camel archers harassed the slow moving army. The general made the prudent decision to make for Punt, making camp outside the city, constructing fortifications to keep raiders out of his camp. 

To his dismay, Senkamaniken and Aratmatle-qo was hot on his trail, and soon surrounded the city of Punt with most Maghrebi and South Cyrenean mercenaries.



************

The Ottoman commander looked at the siege weaponry of the rebels, Aramatle-qo and Senkamaniken had him surrounded. His army seemed to be growing by the hour...

“We’ll have no rest for tonight, for we attack at dawn” said the commander, “For we are all ready to die for our Caliph, in the battlefield of Punt we’ll either stand or die. Tomorrow gentlemen is the day we prevent the history from taking a wrong turn!” 

The Ottoman soldiers, wary of the crisis were encouraged and rejoiced as their spirits was lifted by the optimistic veteran commander. 

At dawn the rebels heard the echoes of the bombards and an army marching in pace. The Ottomans were as sure of victory.

“Allah be with us, for the Caliph has spoken of victory!” was the battle cry as the front line of the Ottoman army who lifted their hand cannons and gave fire. The drowsy rebel force was struck hard from this and many fell either harmed or dead. The Ottomans then dropped their clumsy weapons and charged with drawn swords into the rebel force. Here awaited no glory nor honor, only blood and men giving their lives for their motherland. Both sides fighting for families, freedom and a better future, but who would remember them? The husband, son or friend? War… it can only destroy, like the raging Nile clearing all which stood in its way. Some soldiers thought in the hectic battle when laying in the bloody sand, clutching their wounds,

“When my time has run out… will I get a get a truly worthy end for the battle which I fought so bravely in?"" 

""Would anyone remember me?"" 

""Do soldiers ever get a worthy end, pass hence, disappear to never wake again….”

*********

The Ottomans were defeated soundly at Punt. The Ottomans routed and headed north, humiliated once again in battle. With the populaces rising up against the Ottoman occupiers, the IOC was forced to abandon Punt, and the Ottomans completely abandoned the Southern portion of their Empire.

Egypt's time in the sun was over. Their time as a global power is over, the nation desperately fought to hold onto their position had it ripped from them. Nubia and Kush seceded from the Ottoman Caliphate, to form their own nation.

Soldiers marched to Aswan and Punt, with reports of rioters threatening the city. Punt especially, was an extremely wealthy city of Kushites, who were looking to break away from the Ottoman Caliphate, and forge their own nation. 

A wealthy aristocrat named Senkamanisken was able to garner popular support. He dipped into his deep pockets, and was able to raise a substantial army.

The Essinian Troops, 12,000 of them, moved to help put down the South Cyrenese troops in the southern reaches of Egypt. Unfortunately for them, South Cyrene had scouts, and held power over most of the trade routes from Darfur, Vishanti, and Chikbola. An army of 12,000 men moving across the mountains would definitely reach the ears of the chief. 

His scouts from the North saw glimpses of the Egyptian forces moving south, but they retreated. The strategy was clear, they would trap the rebels in between the two armies. When in the war council meeting, he came up with his plan. 

He would move his army East, into the unincorporated territory, where he would rally 2,000 more desert nomad warriors. He split his army, 4,000 moving south, and 6,000 staying mobile in the southern portion of the country. 

The 4,000 go into the Ethiopian Highlands, and harass the inexperienced and poorly equipped Essinian army. The nomadic and nature of the South Cyrenese troops were adept at leading the Essinian army on a merry chase throughout the Highlands. The 4,000 bade their time, gathering more warriors from Darfur and the Vishanti peoples, and an ambush, in which the South Cyrenese army attacked the Essinians from three sides drove the troops back toward Essinia. 

With rebel control over the Southernmost portions of Egypt, and the Essinians driven back, a great fog fell over the Southern Egypt. Communication was cut off overland, greatly inhibiting the efficiency of messages from Cairo to the Horn of Africa.

As bombards, and gunpowder spread, it would become far easier for rebellions to become destructive. 

The best way to do this would be to create a standard Roman identity. Instead of a mishmash of conquered provinces, he would give all the peoples of his Empire citizenship. 

This was the most expensive and most difficult for his administration to take out. But Julius decreed, exercising his powers as Emperor, that all inhabitants of his Empire's core territories would be granted Roman citizenship, provided they were not slaves, or from foreign lands. 

The Core territories of the Roman Empire would consist of:

* Italia

* Sicily

* Corsica

* Sardinia

* Africa

* Malta

* Hellas

* Crete

* Cyprus

* Thrace

* Macedonia

* Anatolia

All citizens of these regions, would be granted Roman citizenship. 

All privileges and rights applied to them. 

The next thing he did was expand the Senate. The Senate was comprised of 100 members chosen from the aristocratic families of each of the provinces. 

Julius expanded the Senate to over 500 members, with 400 additional seats being elected by the people of the provinces. This gave the citizens of the Roman Empire more representation in government. 

To give the poor even more representation, the Tribunal Council was expanded, giving each major district (territories on a map) three Tribunes to be elected and sent to Rome. 

Julius also instituted official languages, all citizens are expected to know Latin and Greek. Schools for languages, and Universities are set up. Roads are built, cities are planned in the Roman style, baths, amphitheaters and the charms and comforts of Roman life are introduced into nearly every major city. 

The Imperial Administration expected major pushback on these projects, and they did, riots in Anatolia had to be tempered and stopped, but overall, people adjusted. There was no major persecution of the native customs and culture, just an introduction of Greco-Roman culture, infrastructure and governance.

He would Romanize Anatolia, and make it an integral part of the Roman Empire.

But since the great Mongol Battle of Palmyra, the Ottoman Caliphate of Egypt has been in a constant struggle interally and with the nations around it. The great plague of the Mongols ripped through Egypt and the region of Judea. 

Judea and their uprising, the Jews desired independence, and Cyrene would come and enforce it upon them. The first Maghreb-Ottoman War began. The Maghreb Empire smashed the Ottomans, humiliating and forcing the independence of Judea. It wasnt long after the first Maghreb-Ottoman War when the Durrani Emirate, angry over Ottoman ambitions in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean, declared war upon the Ottomans as well. The Emirate was able to remove most Ottoman influence from the area. 

The mighty Ottomans, with their navy and armies, roared back, retaking most of the land around Muscat, crushing the Durrani Emirate, and marching over 100,000 troops through the UTE over threat of death. 

As the Ottomans sought power, they came to blows with the mighty Roman Empire, foolishly attacking and killing their admiral, resulting in the Maghreb, and Rome to declare war. Easily the most destructive of the conflicts, the Roman Empire achieved near total victory, occupying from Alexandria to Cairo, with the Maghreb controlling the Southern portions of the Ottoman Caliphate. 

To add onto this, the Durrani Emirate came for blood and vengeance, again declaring war upon the Ottoman Caliphate, removing them from the Arabian peninsula. 

The Vijayanagara Empire and the far flung colonies of the Ottomans were ripped from their hands. A setback you might say, but the Ottomans were paying tribute to the Romans and Maghreb for 20 years. 

The lands of Mecca and Medina, ruled by the Ottomans were also conquered by the upstart Hashimassid Caliphate, the warlike nation whose goal was to destroy the Ottomans. 

And the Caliphate of Egypt, looked upon this, an moved to declare war against the Indian nation, Vijayanagara, in which the Bengal Empire and Rajavansa joined in. The Hashimassids continued their campaigning, destroying Ottoman control over Sinai.

But the Ottomans miraculously won in India, and they solidified their power in the region, but at what cost. The Sinai was lost. The Holy Lands of Mecca and Medina are lost. Over 31,000 of the 60,000 men the Egyptians had deployed were killed, an entire army never returned on their campaign in the Pala Empire in Bengali. 

**************

The cost of war in terms of money and of lives have upset the people of the Caliphate. The Aristocrats rebelled aided by the peasants in the south, the poorest region of the Caliphate, as the Caliph quickly lost legitimacy. 

Even the spoils of war could not put a dent in the debts of the Caliph, and the economy crashed. There were not enough men to plow the fields, and a famine struck the nation.

The Galleon would be outfitted with mounted Bombards, while retaining Ballistae and Mangonels. 

The Fluyts would replace most of the Carracks, as the Carracks would be outfitted with bombards as well. The TTC would become a major power in the region. 

The Fluyts and Caravels would be the merchant fleet, numbering over 100 of them, while the Carracks and Galleons would be the escort fleet, with about 55 Carracks and 10 Galleons being built in the Persian Gulf and UTE.

He had a very successful reign, widening Imperial influence, and striking down major competitors. 

The Empire was powerful once again, and wealth from their campaigns, and stability in Imperial lands catapulted a period of intellectualism, and Roman art and culture. 

The successor rose to the throne, a relatively young man, at age 37 was crowned. A crown of laurels was placed on his head in the Circus Maximus, and Julius Aurelius Constantinus Augustus rose to the throne. 

He was a distinguished intellectual, having studied in Rome at the University there. He served as an officer in the siege of Alexandria and Cairo. After the Egypto-Roman war, he served as an Aedile for the Mediterranean-Black Currency, and worked closely with the TTC in their Far Atlantic dealings. He has sailed to Serica, and seen the Confederacy and Santee Empire with his own eyes.

After hearing of the different tribes and polities of the Confederacy of Manahatta, the Roman and TTC officials began speaking of the peoples of the Roman Empire. The Lenape scholars had gone to Rome to study Latin and Greek, and learned of the culture, history and civilization of the Romans. 

But as they learned, and observed the Grand Council and their delegates, they saw some ways to exploit the system, and use it to benefit. The TTC and Roman Empire collaborated in a plan. The Romans would sell their vast stores of weapons of solid steel to the Lenape, Susquehanna, and Iroquois to bolster their contingents of the Confederate army. 

Romans would also sell them horses, and beasts of burden. The price, would be influence. Corn, Squash, Beans, and tobacco would be traded back to the TTC, and it would be in Roman interests to keep the Confederacy stable.  The Romans had a large demonstration of the type of weapons they brought to Serica, showing very clearly the advantages of steel and Roman weaponry. 

They next sailed to Vinland, where they spoke with the people on the island chain, the Norse peoples under the umbrella of the Confederacy. The Romans promised the lone councilman that they would work to get them extra delegates in Manahatta, and work on electing a Vinlander as King of the Confederacy. 

If this deal is accepted, the Romans would start to exert their influence on over half of the delegates of the Confederacy...

The last proposal is the ideal of permanent settlements of Romans in the Confederacy. This would aid in the cultural and language exchange, as well as bettering relations between the two nations. 

The details of this arrangement are pending. 

An embassy would be in Manahatta where the Roman Empire would operate out of. 

********

In the Santee Empire, the Romans had gained an audience with the delegates from the Cotton party. This system, where the Empire was ruled by delegates from two main political parties was strange. Even in the days of the Roman and Hellenic Republics, there were multiple ""parties"" that had different agendas.

The Romans were interest in the vast amount of Cotton that could be traded for, and offered the Cottons a deal, all surpluses would be sold to the TTC, in return they would be able to name their price on what they wanted. The [markets and catalogs of Roman goods](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PI0bifT2LzEv8dXfUXGQWNM6evWX43zt4r_WhMWhsjk/edit#gid=0) were opened. 

**********

The Roman Empire and TTC worked extremely closely on this matter, with high Imperial officials and prominent merchants of the Far Atlantic Branch of the TTC. 

The island of Bermuda became a hub for Roman ships to dock and resupply, and significant investments were made to build the infrastructure on the island. Many Romans seeking business opportunities moved out to Bermuda to operate.

From what I know, since I did not start Christianity, Jesus the Christ was a man living in Morocco under the Catalunian Empire. 

So the base of Catholicism was Aragon for a looong time, before moving to Rome. 

As far as Roman Catholicism goes, it has blended quite well with the ancient traditions. Easter is celebrated during the old fertility festivals, All Hallows Eve is celebrated, and Christmas is celebrated near the winter solstice. The rituals and practices, as well as the values of the Old Roman gods were prevalent in their influence on Catholicism. Animal sacrifices, traditions and such are very important to Catholicism. 

One of the most important things to note is that all the books of the Catholic Bible are, to my knowledge, just as the books are in OTL. So Judaism and Christianity are tied. 

The main difference is because of a powerful Roman State, the Catholic Church did not have the political pull it does in OTL. The tweaks in doctrine are minimal, and the texts are written in Latin and Greek. 

Masses in Roman Catholicism are only said in Greek and Latin. Catholicism is not as evangelistic, or as powerful as they are in real life. A series of Crusades did occur in Iberia, which collapsed the powerful Iberian Empire. 

For the most part, the Pope has played second fiddle to the Emperor, only confirming or giving his opinion on matters. Because of his situation, in which he was contained to the city of Rome, and before that, the island of Elbe, the Pope was easily controlled. This allows Roman and Catholic nation's interest to be aligned quite nicely (I can point to examples of this, in Francia, Aragon, Hellas, Russia).

After the fall of Lebanon, the Catholic Church suffered a huge blow when the successive Muslim nations committed genocide against Catholics, eliminating them from the region essentially. 

As of now, by PMs and RP, the most powerful Catholic State is Francia, with over 12 million Catholics in its borders. Aragon and Lower Britannia have a combined 12 million more Catholics. 

In the Roman Empire, the population is far more diverse. While most of the Roman Empire is Catholic, about 16 million Catholics, they also have sizable populations of Orthodox Christians, Faryabans, and Muslims. Nearly 1 million people in northern Italy are Faryabans. While in the provinces of Pontus, Ionia, and Asia, there are nearly 1.5 million Muslims intermixed with Catholic communities. 2.5 million Orthodox Christians live in Macedonia and Thrace. Other small minorities follow Judaism, Grattic faith, and even some the old pantheon of the Greco-Roman-Punic Gods. 

For now, the tensions between these groups is low, a small outbreak, mob, or skirmish happens occasionally, but nothing of true note. 

Most Catholics are in these areas, but a sizable population of Catholics reside in the Empire of the Maghreb, in the State of Cyrene. They number around a little less than 1 million. Small populations of Catholics reside in Frisia, and in pockets of Bohemia and Saxony proper. 

With this, missionaries and priests are sent abroad, in order to convert people to Catholicism, spreading the message of peace and redemption for all men and women. They go to Russia (mostly Crimea, Southern Ukraine, and Uburzia where they would most likely be successful), Egypt, Neo-Lebanon, Cappadocia, and Saxony.

They begin to preach the word of God. They are official Roman Catholic priests and missionaries, and are Roman citizens. ",HistoricalWorldPowers,State of Catholicism,https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWorldPowers/comments/4i2qjd/state_of_catholicism/

The Romans were pushed back to the Crimean peninsula, but they still held much of the land in Urburzia and the actual Crimean peninsula, as well as ruling the waves on the Black sea. The Russians could absolutely not starve the Roman forces out. 

The Russian King was on a mission though, to unite all of Russia back into his Empire. For decades he had fought the Golden Horde, smashed them at the Volga, now he looked to push Roman Might back into the Sea. The Romans had only been in Russia for a few decades, yet still inspired quite a bit of loyalty among the subjects there. The infrastructure and culture that had been imported had changed the region, probably forever. 

Southern Ukraine, Crimea, and Urburzia looked and were administrated more like provinces than occupied territories. This allowed for armies to be raised from the communities there.

While they werent as effective as Roman Legions, they still did their job well. 

While Michael I saw it was hopeless to storm Crimea, he decided to loop around the peninsula, and attack Urburzia, where a substantial Greek population lived. The governor and commander of the Roman forces saw this movement and brought their makeshift Legions to Urburzia to make a stand. In Urburzia, a force of 15,000 extra volunteers were waiting for them, swelling up the Roman forces to 33,000 men. They met the Russian Host at the northern frontier of Urburzia. 

The Russian forces were able to utilize their terrifying new weapons to gain a quick upper hand, but the determination and discipline of the Roman forces allowed for them to push the battle to a stalemate. 

Michael I called for reinforcements, and returned a few weeks later. This time the Romans looked to ambush the Russian force, they drew them into Urburzia, where they surrounded the Russians and attacked them from all sides. 

Where the Knights of Jupiter failed before they succeeded here. 3,000 Knights of Jupiter smashed into the vulnerable flank of the Russian force, forcing the army to route. But just as the Romans were ferocious and brave, the Russians were too. Michael I did not panic, and reorganized his surprised army and lead a courageous counter offensive.

A Russian victory in Urburzia seemed impossible, given the circumstances, but the hardiness of the Russians, as well as their numbers won the day, the Romans retreated to Crimea. 

Michael I reintegrated Urburzia into the Russian Empire.

The European continent is an interesting one, or should be an interesting one. We are at a crossroads, where every Empire is gigantic and covers vast amounts of land. 

This is great for player nations, but restricts the opportunity for new players. This, and with vast Empires like Russia, Saxony, Francia, and Bohemia going through long periods of inactivity, is not conducive to an environment for good RP and development for the continent as a whole. It may seem like I am calling out these players specifically, but this is a situation where I must be blunt in my words as a major Empire of Europe and a mod that is looking for what is best for the subreddit. 

I had initially though that forcing players to give up tracts of land for internal claims would work, but clearly that is not working, and something more drastic needs to be done. 

So, in this post, I will be asking certain players if they are willing to part with certain regions. You may still RP with those regions, but they must be made available for new claimants. 

As a good player, and a good role model, I will make vacate the lands of **Illyria** and **Iberia** completely. 

The areas I am looking to clear out are:

* The British Isles, that means you /u/Achierius and /u/duqdukes123 

* All parts of Saxony not on the mainland, including Finland, Denmark and Scandinavia

* Bohemia needs to be reigned in, with Illyria abandoned, I suggest /u/dabor1 vacate all lands on the Danube River. 

* Russia, while I will not request you to give up land, I implore you to start RPing like the hegemon you should be. You need to be more active in RP, in starting RP, and driving RP for Europe as a whole. I am asking that you make the regions of Ukraine, Belarus, the Baltics, and the Don available for internal claims. 

While this is an ask from me, not doing this may result in me and the rest of the modteam instituting a Crisis that will force these lands from you.

* West Africa, yea.../u/laskaka has really built himself a world there. If you know anyone that would be interested in an RP rich world, then direct them there. 

*  /u/Engishark2 has created many Kingdoms and Empires in the Indian Subcontinent. If you know anyone that would be interested in RP there, then direct them here. 

* Russia is at war with the Golden Horde, and the Romans have declared war on the Golden Horde and occupied a large portion of their territory. So /u/vladzov do not fear. That land still belongs to you.

There has been Empires throughout the centuries in the Balkans. At the dawn of the independence of the Roman People, the Kingdom of Dalmatia, a powerful Kingdom in the Balkans ruled, lording over the Danube.

Their power was great, and they smashed the Polish Empire. The [Illyrian Empire](http://imgur.com/y8YtOOx) reached its peak on the end of the wars against the Kharaangar raiders, a threat that nearly broke Europe. 

But all things come to an end, and the Illyrian Empire proved to be not as stable as one would like, and the dissolution happened, wars were fought. 

The lords of the former Illyrian Empire stood tall, Illyria, Pannonia, Moesia, and Dacia all warred against the nations around them, falling to the mighty Romans and Knights of Jupiter. The small Principate of Serbia and Illyria both became their own nations. 

******

The [Domain of the Knights of Jupiter](http://i.imgur.com/k9expYT.jpg) was the next great power of the Balkans. They smashed the Russians at the Danube, and were powerful allies of the Romans. Their size and warring nature destabilized, and they were felled by the Golden Horde. Most of the fighting against the Golden Horde happened in the Balkans. 


*****

The Knights were forced to reorganize, reforming into the [Balkan Dominion](http://i.imgur.com/aj26DL7.jpg), ruled from Sofia, but soon fell into disrepair.

Soon the warring tribes fell into disrepair, as [the Republic of Propontis, Thrace and Macedonia, and the Balkan Confederation](http://i.imgur.com/8ueL1E5.jpg) formed in the area.

With Macedonia and Thrace, and Propontis joining the Roman Empire, the Balkan Confederation was the last vestige of independent power in the Balkans. Frequent Campaigns from the Romans, through the Macedonians and Thracians, as well as the Proponti, smashed their influence, and the rise of a new nation spelled the end of their rule.

[Transylvania](http://i.imgur.com/uDMOY7I.jpg), a nation bordering the Roman Empire, now lies in the Balkans, and on the mouth of the Danube. It existed for a time, before its flame was extinguished during the Mongol Invasion of the Balkans. The Bohemians moved into the region, and bore the brunt of the Invasion of the Balkans

He knew from TTC missions up there that there was still a large Greek population in Crimean and Southern Ukraine. This knowledge, and the apparent weakening of the Golden Horde showed him that the time was right to seize land in the area. 

Under his orders, conspirators from the lands of Hellas sailed up the Black Sea to rouse the masses to rebellion. Russians, Ukrainians, Greeks, and others soon were ready to revolt. While the seeds of rebellion were sown, the Horde still controlled the area with an iron fist. 

Julius Augustus Marius left Rome, leaving the city to be administered by his brother, Constantine. Julius moved to Bospor, where he would receive news much quicker. When he received a message from a prominent Greek in Crimea, Alexei, Julius mustered three Legions and 10,000 Knights of Jupiter. The mighty fleet of Rome mustered, and Dromon escorted the army to the shores of Crimea. 

As the standard of Rome was seen from the shores of Crimea, the defense forces of the Horde mustered, unfortunately, the small and fragile Triremes were not a match for the sturdy Dromon. Julius watched from his Baghlah as thousands of Roman troops landed on the shores of Crimea. The Hordes forces were slaughtered not only by the Romans but the rebelling forces who welcomed the Romans as liberators. 

Small skirmishes took place over the next few weeks, but by a months end, the Crimean peninsula was under control of the Roman Army.

As the Romans re-vitalized trade of the Mediterranean, the TTC soon looked for other places to expand their influence. Rapid expansion was possible due to the profits the TTC was making through their lucrative agreement with the IOC, and their vast and far flung branches in Francia, Britannia, Iberia, and the Jewish Republic of Yashou. 

The Mediterranean, the core of the trading network, was firmly in control of Rome's navy and her allies. With the straits of Gibraltar under Roman control, the threat that Rome could exert her influence in the far Atlantic and North Seas was enough to keep most nations from bothering the TTC. 

For the TTC to go to the next step, to truly make themselves a force to be reckoned with, they looked East, to the Durrani. Knowing the Ottomans had strict control of the Red Sea and Indian Ocean, the TTC would move to invest in the naval capability of the nations of the Persian Gulf.

As the Order of the Golden Hand was gripped in near constant warfare, the TTC knew that it was a matter of time before they raise the tolls and tariffs on the straits. And so they put together the first battle fleet. Consisting of 5 Carracks, 10 Caravels, 20 Sambuks, 6 Ghanjah and 20 Sambuks. These ships were mostly converted merchant vessels, but they had the latest artillery of the Romans mounted on their decks, and the most sophisticated technology that the Roman Navy had to offer.

The TTC's fleet defeated the Golden Hand at the straits, with their highly maneuverable and sturdy ships, and the Aragonese mercenaries occupied the land. 

Soon word was sent to the Roman Emperor requesting the regions be administered by the Roman Empire. The Emperor dispatched two Legions to hold the territories, and the straits were annexed to the Roman Empire, with authority given to the TTC to manage all trade through those straits.

Over the next year, Athens and Corinth were put under siege. The Roman Navy, with the remaining Egyptian ships, managed to defeat a large Hellenic fleet near the island of Euboea. 

The Romans were very aware that the Greeks could drag this war out for decades, with their fortresses in Pontus, the countless islands of the Aegean, and the great fortress of Bospor, but it would be senseless violence, and they were tired of war. With this, the leadership of the Hellenic Republic surrendered. 

*******

As terms of peace were laid out, the Hellenic Republic knew it was in dire straits. The Emperor of Rome took a hard line against this rebellion. The Roman Empire had lost so much in the past decade, and he looked to unite the remaining territories he had even more. 

And so, the Republics were abolished, or combined into one Imperial Administration. Senates and Tribunal Councils were combined, and moved to Rome. 

The Senate would represent the interests of the wealthy in the lands of the Empire. The Tribunes would represent the interests of the people in the lands of the Empire.

The Emperor would be the final say, but the Senate and Tribunal could overrule his commands with a 75% majority. 

The Hellenic Republic, and the Republic of Macedonia and Thrace were broken up into provinces, which would be governed by a proconsul, or governor.

One was Roman, consisting of two battle groups, one consisting 15 Heavy Dromon, 20 Normal Dromon, 1 Hexareme, and 5 Light Dromon, the other consisting of 3 Octeres, 4 Hexaremes, 10 Heavy Dromon, 10 Light Dromon, and 20 Normal Dromon. 

The other fleet, was the Egyptian Fleet, with two groups of 25 ships, consisting of 8 carracks, 2 Octeres, 5 septiremes, 5 hexaremes, and 5 caravels each. Scouts from the Hellenic Republic soon moved to gather their vast fleets to engage these enemy ships. 

The Roman fleet was given the priority, the leadership and capability of their marines and ships was unparalleled. The Egyptians had swifter, less concerning ships. 

********

**The Romans vs the Hellenic Fleet**

The Roman leadership knew in order to cut off the power that the rebelling nation had, it was necessary to gain the support of their constituent Republics. This included Rhodes, Crete, and Cyprus. To do this, the Romans needed an open line of communication, in order to negotiate with them, and for this to happen, they needed to break hegemony of Hellas. 

The Roman fleet, consisting of only Galleys, engage a large Hellenic detachment that was deployed from Corinth. Corinth was the ultimate goal for the Romans in the early stages of the Naval theatre. The Roman Galleys would make for Melos, a small island north of Crete.

The Greeks sent a fleet of 35 Normal Dromon, 25 Heavy Dromon, 3 Hexaremes, 1 Octere, and 25 Escort Dromon.  

As the fleets go in formation, the commanders gave the command, and the Mongonels and Ballista fired. Flaming projectiles were flung at each other until the Galleys rowed hard and fast toward each other. Soon, in the middle of the Sea, the battle was fought. A bloody battle, in which many ships were sunk and captured. Soon the Greeks pulled back up the Peloponnesian coast, and the Romans were in hot pursuit. 

A small heavy ship detatchment, 1 Octere, 5 Heavy Dromon, and 6 Light Dromon made their way to Melos, where they besieged and stormed the island. 

The rest of the Roman fleet was heavily damaged on the Peloponnesian coast, as the Hellenic fleet lead them into sandbars, rocky shores, and fought them up the coast. The Roman fleet made its way to Melos for repairs, solidifying their hold on the small island. 

As this battle went on, the Egyptians engaged a Hellenic fleet. 

**The Egyptian Fleet vs the Hellenic Fleet**

As the Egyptians sailed past Crete toward Melos, the fleet make up was noted. The Cretans and Rhodesians soon deployed their dhows to tail them. 20 Sambuks, 10 Ghanjahs, and 1 Baghlah.

The Hellenese got word of the fleet, and deployed the heaviest battle group against them. 10 Hexaremes, 4 Octeres, 30 Heavy Dromon and  intercepted the Egyptian fleet. The Hellenic Octeres dwarfed any ship the Egyptians could muster, even their Octeres, and they lead the charge, heavily armed and armored. 

The Galleys attempted to move away, but where the Carracks and Caravels excelled, their Galley did not. And a bitter fight begun, the heavier ships of the Greeks seemed to overwhelm the Galleys, who withdrew quickly. The Quicklime grenades thrown by the Egytians set fire to a few ships, but the fleet was in full retreat, until they ran into the Dhows tailing them. The Galleys smashed through them, but the Carracks and Caravels looked to avoid them, and two Carracks and a Caravel was snagged by Harpaxes from the Greek fleet, and captured. 

With the Greeks looking to regroup at Crete, the Egyptians went and besieged the small island of Karpathos, next to Rhodes. They requested more ships to reinforce the position, and the Romans sent transport Cogs with men to hold the island.

**Battle of the Gulf of Corinth**

While the campaign on the Eastern side of Hellas was a moderate success, the Greeks were ready for an assault on the Gulf of Corinth, and the Romans could not break through, they suffered heavy casualties. The battle did, however, allow the Romans to land two legions and a minor Legion in Epirus. 

********

On the ground, the Romans and Illyrians with aid from the Bohemians trapped and routed another Macedonian army. As the Illyrians and Bohemians besieged Thessalonika, an army from Thrace flanked and pushed them back West, where they joined up with the Roman army marching south into Thessaly. 

The Greeks harassed this army and the Thracians moved to cut them off from the north...in a long winter, the Roman-Illyrian-Bohemian coalition was trapped. They soon turned from their march towards Athens West, to the coast along the Gulf of Corinth, where they captured Delphi. They observed the catastrophic battle of the Gulf, and knew that they needed to march toward Athens. The war must be ended soon. 


*******

Fortunately, with the Roman victory and occupation of Melos, the Republic of Crete soon joined the Roman cause, and the South Eastern Mediterranean was brought under Roman control. Troops were sailed to Melos with escorts, and the invasion of Hellas began. 

Three Legions were deployed on the shores of the Peloponnese, while the Roman Navy suffered heavy casualties, the armies were able to defeat a Hellenic Legion near Laconia. As the army marched toward Corinth, the writing was on the wall. Roman troops were in Hellas, One contingent marching toward Corinth, the other toward Athens.

Mechanics for normal claims will still be the same. 

The Official map will have the actual borders in game, in which players are allowed to use for population.

Thankfully, the Imperators and Admare's of Rome were up to the task. Building their own grand fleet, the Romans prepared to assault the Hellenic coast. Their goal was to seize control of the Gulf of Corinth, which would give them easy access to the major cities of Hellas and a quick end to the war. 

With the Corinthian Canal, the challenge was there, the Romans would have to account for the ease of access and the quick reinforcement of ships in the Gulf.

Thankfully, the Egyptians were willing to aid the Romans, their considerable fleet of 50 ships, with two divisions of 8 carracks, 2 Octeres, 5 septiremes, 5 hexaremes, and 5 caravels. These mighty ships would be instructed to sail the East Mediterranean, where they would engage a portion of the Hellenic Fleet, while the Romans would aid them there.

The next week would see the Romans win three consecutive battles in Southern Illyria, bringing the Principate back into the fold, and routing a strong Macedonian army. 

The Battle of Split, in which a 20,000 man Illyrian and Macedonian force besieged the city, was swift. When the trumpets sounded, and the Romans began to march toward the besieging force, they broke off their siege immediately, and regrouped further south. Their numbers there bolstered to 26,000.  The Romans continued South, and a large battle took place on the border between the Kingdom and the Principate. The fresh and superior fighting force won the day, and the Illyrians retreated deeper into their own territory, with the Romans quick on their tale. 

The Romans would move and bolster their armies from Illyria, and now their force would swell in size to 21,000 men. With 3,000 additional cavalry from Illyria. 

The decisive battle against the Illyrian Principate was a few days later, and the Romans were victorious once again. Unfortunately, the 21,000 man force suffered 4,000 casualties. The princeps of Illyria was killed in the battle, and the rest of the Principate joined the fold. 

Unfortunately the fight was not over. Macedonia marched from the south with 15,000 more men, to reinforce the 15,000 remaining troops of the Illyrian Principate. 

This battle was daunting, and it did not seem like the Romans had a chance, but messages were sent in the night, promising the Macedonian commanders clemency for switching sides, stating that Roman victories on the Sea, and the fall of Serbia spells doom for their cause.

As the ships spotted each other, the Admares of each fleet surveyed the situation. The Island of Malta was an important strategical fortress in the Mediterranean, heavily fortified and a pillar of strength. It was also a key naval base for the Roman Empire, holding the majority of the Dromon attack force. 

Unfortunately, the Romans do not have the manpower on Malta to man these ships to participate in the battle. 

The Roman Admare knew he was outnumbered, but he knew the resilience, and so, he took an fierce offensive against the Hellenic Fleet and launched an immediate offensive as the Hellenic Fleet came into view. 

With Ballista, Onagers, and Naphtha Grenades, the Greeks suffered heavy casualties at the beginning of the battled, but the maneuverability allowed the Greeks to regroup, and come in with a more concerted effort to crush the Romans against the rocky shores of Malta.

The Hellenic Navy charged through, firing their artillery, attempting to board the Sambuk ships, but cam under fire from the much more powerful and static defenses of the island.

And the ships smashed against each other, wood splintered, and men ran to board each others ships. Ballista bolts flew, rocks flew, ships burned.

**On the Sea**

Egypt wins any major engagements, but with the fortifications, and the tactics that Cyrene uses to defend only major points, as well as having strong fortifications.

Egypt wins the sea, and has control of the Mediterranean.


**On Land**

At Alexandria, the larger army of the two armies of the Maghreb surrounds the city, waiting for the Caliphate's troops to attack. They know taking the city is hopeless, but still hold the troops at the city. Any attempted to break the siege from within Alexandria would be met with a major engagement. The army of Cyrene holds the countryside, and the supply lines are clear. They cannot starve the city out though. 


Meanwhile, the entire Camel Corps, with 15,000 extra men run free over the Egyptian countryside. The army is able to live off the land, but also has a strong baggage train and is well supplied.

20,000 Bohemians marched with the Romans, battle tested. 10,000 from the Near East, veterans of the battles of the Danube and the 1st and 2nd Battles of Prag. 

Determined these men were, the Bohemians, fighting for their country lead the way, the Roman Generals Marcus Felix Claudius, Lucius Felix and the Grandmaster of the Knights of Jupiter, Xanthias Aristarches had a plan. They knew from reports that the artillery of the Mongol Empire would be trained on them again, so they spread their troops out, so as to mitigate the artillery's destructive power against the previously tightly packed ranks of the Roman battle lines. 

When they approached Prag, they made camp, and began to construct artillery of their own. Mangonels, ballistae, and trebuchets were built. They awaited a messenger bird from the Emperor, who was himself marching with another army, 24,000 men of elite troops would arrive from the West. 

When it was time, the great army broke camp, and the 20,000 Bohemians, due to their commander and their bloodlust, volunteered to lead the way against the Mongols. 

And so it happened, in 1501 CE, on a cool morning in March, 20,000 Bohemians poured over a hill, the Mongols looked ready, they fired their cannons, the Romans followed the Bohemians. 

The Roman Artillery was rolled into place, and it was a sight for the ages, volleys of artillery were flung into the Mongol ranks as their cannons fired back. The fierce warriors of the Roman-Bohemian coalition smashed into the front lines, grenades and hand-cannons exploded, smoke filled the air. 


Soon the Emperor and his forces arrived from the West, and they fought through the city in one of the most destructive battles in the history of Europe. 

Every block, every bridge, and crossing was fought for. By the end of the day, the Roman-Bohemian coalition was victorious, the Mongols fleeing once again to their Empire. 

The Romans sustained heavy casualties once again. The Emperor himself lay dead in the city of Prag, hit by a cannon. The surviving Romans, just 30,000 left occupied the corpse ridden city. 

[Map](http://i.imgur.com/kmAJr6L.jpg)

And thus ends, the battles of Prag. Now known to be a graveyard of dead Romans, the city lays in ruins, it may never reach its former glory, but the amount of life, and resources put into fighting for this city was astonishing. 

The Mongol Wars conclude, but how long will their effects be felt. The plague grips Hellas, Macedonia and Illyria as Francia and Aragon increase their wealth and influence. The waning power of the Roman Empire was clear as day, soon the nations would split off, and there would be more war and death. The hegemony, stability and wealth the Empire provided would be remembered, and the sacrifice that the Roman Empire made, to keep the Mongol yoke away from the proud peoples of the Mediterranean would live on the Annals of Rome. A great Obelisk would be constructed in Rome, to commemorate the victory and selfless sacrifice the good Roman people made for the good of Europe.

[The Battle of Tripoli](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWorldPowers/comments/4c4gx3/the_khamag_invasion_of_dharja_the_siege_of_tripoli/)

Fighting on the Danube River was fierce, the Mongol forces rode across the rivers many bridges, raided the towns and returned. The elaborate system of fortresses upon the River, that stood and were manned by Bohemians stood strong. 


But the appearance of a large Mongol army that marched and besieged three major fortresses at once, 20,000 Mongols each, was enough to set the Romans upon defending their Northern frontier. Like the army that marched to Prag, the Romans marched from Novi Sad.

They marched with 3 Legions, 3 Minor Legions and 15,000 Knights of Jupiter, 60,000 men, to relieve the Bohemian fortresses on the Danube.

The logical plan for most people would be to come reinforce the fortresses from the South, and bolster their defenses, but Marcus Felix Claudius went with the daring plan. With the Grandmaster of the Knights of Jupiter at his side, Xanthias Aristarches, the generals moved their armies north of the Danube River, into enemy territory, and marched south upon the River.

It wasn't long before they could smell the smoke from the siege of the first fortress. The Romans were able to take the first army on its unawares, 15,000 Knights of Jupiter, with the Equites from the Legions crushing the army there. They were scattered and broken. 


As the Romans marched with haste down the River, the Mongols were ready, their cannons and guns trained on the army moving forward, the mines and grenades thrown toward the ranks. Explosions crippling dozens of Romans. Fortunately volleys of crossbow bolts, and volleys of javelins were thrown back to break the ranks of the Mongols. The second Mongol army, now with 32,000 troops, fought back with the ferocity of the troops on the Prag. 

As the battle of Prag was being fought, the 2nd fortress of the Danube was being liberated from the Mongol siege. 13,000 Roman Legionaries died in the struggle, but the Mongols were pushed back yet again, with the Romans, now bolstered by Bohemian troops, hot on their trail. 


They moved to the third fortress, whose numbers were bolstered yet again. The Roman-Bohemian coalition numbered 55,000 troops to the Mongols 40,000 troops. The fortress was situated near the Mouth of the Danube. And the Mongols were fully ready this time. Their cavalry harassing the flanks and extending the battle line before the cannons did their work, breaking apart the thinned Roman lines. The Roman general kept on with his tactics, and as his troops approached the Mongol battle lines, the tide was clearly turning to the Mongols. But the Romans could not lose, they fought with all of their might, but the guns, the booms of the cannons, the grenades, they were too much. Portions of the Roman army began to break, and the battle looked over. But the Bohemian forces, garrisoned at the fortress, sallied forth and attacked the Mongol forces from the rear. Even though they were ready, the Bohemians were able to overwhelm the rear of the Mongol army. 

Seeing this development, many of the Roman troops pushed onward, crossbow volleys were consistent, the Legionaries, the spearmen, the pikemen, the Knights of Jupiter, their attack was relentless and crushing.

The Mongol army was crushed between the two forces with only a meager 10,000 being able to flee back to the Khans lands. But at what cost were the Romans and Bohemians victorious. Of the 60,000 man army that marched on the Danube, only 35,000 remained. They remained at the third fortress, to lick their wounds, and regroup. They had fought three exhausting and brutal battles in 3 weeks.

That was until they received a message from Novi Sad.

Soon, violence gripped the Maghreb as well. But all was not lost.

The Roman Army marched with haste from the great city of Split, where they met at Novi Sad. The generals were given their orders, and the armies of Rome marched within the week. 

The Roman army sent to the Danube, lead by Pericles Andromache, was able to push back the forces, but no decisive engagement was made. The Mongols lead the Romans on a merry chase up and down the Danube. 

The next army, lead by the Roman General Lucius Felix, marched North. His contingent was made up of mostly Francian and Aragonese, fresh troops from far away. As his army march north, toward the city of Prag, messengers came, urging the army to move faster, as the city was besieged by the Mongols. 


65,000 men of the Roman Empire, 5,000 Elite Francian Cavalry, 4 Legions and 4 Minor Legions marched with haste to the city of Prag. Many of the officers wondered what the scene would be like when they got there. They had heard of the battles in Russia, about the weapons the Mongols wielded. 

Still, the Romans had faith in their commanders. 

Then they saw the smoke, and smelt the death. The city of Prag, or the smoke billowing from the battle, could be seen from miles away. Scouts came back with reports that most of the city seemed burnt to the ground. Enormous contraptions were stationed outside the city, a flash and a boom and explosions would happend. 

Lucius Felix gave the order, hearing the Mongols and their renowned Cavalry, he put the Pikemen to the front, with the Legionaries behind them. The Spearmen protected the flanks, and the crossbowmen, with their repeating crossbows in the rear. The trumpet sounded, and four standards of Rome, with the Golden Eagle gleaming in the sun were raised. The men of Rome beat their shields, creating a loud din. 


And they marched forward. The Mongols saw the approaching forces and formed up their army, 55,000 strong to face them. The great cannons were moved slowly to point at the mass of Romans. The General, determined and confident at the Romans discipline and his tactics, pushed his officers on. Once the troops were in range, the cannons fired. 

Hundreds of lives were extinguished in an instant. Bodies flew everywhere, ranks were broken, and the attack was rushed. Soon the Roman lines, broken and fragmented, came within range of the guns of the army, in which hundreds more were slaughtered. 

The ranks slammed into each other. And this is where the Romans presumably had the upper hand, the well trained legionaries would engage in close combat, but the Mongols were fierce fighters, and smart fighters. They had taken troops from everywhere they had conquered, and they fought with the ferocity that had been unknown to the Romans. 

But the Romans were butchers too, their culture was forged on brutality, their Empire, stretching from Hispania to Pontus, built on warfare and the butchery of their enemies. One could say the Khan was surprised that the he encountered an enemy that fought with the savagery and ruthlessness his forces did.

As the Equites and Francian Cavalry looped around the battles lines, and engaged the Mongol Horsemen, while less skilled the Equites and Francian horses also rode on Mongol horses while also outnumbering them. They were able to drive the Cavalry away before turning their lances on the exposed flanks of the Mongol battle lines. They smashed through the flank and the Khan knew it was finished. There was little he could do except retreat and regroup. 

Lucius overlooked the destruction of the battle, by the end of the day, the army of 65,000 he had brought with him dwindled to 43,000. 22,000 men had perished, while the Romans had influcted 10,000 deaths upon the Mongols. But they had saved Prag, or what was left of it. And that was surely enough, right?

While this was a huge advantage for them, it also made it so they paid Imperial taxes, which impacted their profits. But because of the wealth, the Company is able to essentially bribe and buy Senators to vote on resolutions that benefit them. This allows the Company to act essentially independently. 

The expansion and sophisitication of the Thuran Company was noticed by the military leaders, who looked at the Navy of the Roman Empire and saw that the it had to be revamped. In recent years, the Navy had become outdated, and unwieldy. 

So, with approval of the Imperial Senate and the Emperor, 60% of the Roman Cargo Fleet, which contains the most ships of the Roman Empire, were turned over to the Thuran Trading Company.

After a short while, with the Bohemian army garrisoned on the fortresses on the banks of the River, the Roman Imperial forces, which were ordered to be gathered, began to regroup and organize a counteroffensive. 

The meeting place would be Novi-Sad, the provincial capital of Serbia, a vassal of the Kingdom of Illyria.

The first Legions of the Empire to arrive were ones of Illyria, who bordered mighty Bohemia. They contributed two Legions and two Minor Legions, as well as 15,000 Knights of Jupiter to the cause. 

The Republic of Macedonia and Thrace, and the Republic of Hellas both had troops in the Near East, and so they sent 1 Legion and 1 Minor Legion between the two of them. 

The Roman Republic's forces arrived next. The prudent Consuls and First Citizens of the Senate sent 1 Legion and 1 Minor Legion, due to their involvement in the Near East, and the logistical support that they would provide. 


The Roman Republic sent messages to Francia and Aragon, members of the Most Holy Union, but also vassals of the Roman Empire, urging them to raise troops for the Imperial army. 

Aragon gathered and sent 1 Legion and 1 Minor Legion, while [Francia sent 20,000 troops](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWorldPowers/comments/48jces/obligations_to_the_empire/d0k6uj5) to the cause. 



The forces would be split once again, with a considerable army headed to relieve the siege of Prag, and the other to mount an counter offensive across the Danube. 

The army that is marching to Prag, will be the 5,000 Elite Francian Cavalry, 4 Legions and 4 Minor Legions (65,000 total men).

The army that will be marching toward the Danube River, will be 3 Legions, 3 Minor Legions, and the 15,000 Knights of Jupiter (60,000 total men).

King Hiero rose to power, being a young man, he decided he needed reach out and establish his new reign as legitimate in the eyes of the mighty powers of the Mediterranean.

Syracuse, a city and settlement that has just as much a decorated history as Rome and Carthage, was on a trade key lane in the Mediterranean.

King Hiero sent his councillors close friends with a guard of 30 Hoplites each.

To Rome he sent the wise Thales, who was granted citizenship late in his life, in order to cement a trade relationship with the Republic, who has been declared the hegemon of all Italia by mighty Ptolemy. Syracuse offered to sell its Greek wine and extra grain for equipment and protection. They also wish to learn their ways of combat, which has shown to be far superior than the traditional phalanx. In return for this, Hiero will offer up part of their fleet to provide training on naval matters as well as ship designs not available to the Romans yet.

********

To Carthage goes Hector, a young warrior with Trojan ancestry. He looks to establish a trade relationship with the far flung trading Empire of the Ponii. Hiero will offer their services in communication with the Greek and Roman world to boost profits for the Carthaginians. Syracuse's small size, but important position will allow it to negotiate easily and act as an intermediary between the two budding powers.

It was a confederation of nations under the banner of a single Empire. When you actually looked at it, it was a complex network of nations who have unique relationships with the Empire and each other. 

While the nations are part of the Empire, each of the nations have carved out their own spheres of influence. 


Take Hellas-Roma, which is an alliance between Rome, Hellas, and the Thuran Trading Company to secure their trade and military security in the Mediterranean. 

In Hellas-Roma, there is the Hellenic Republic, who have essentially made the Republic of Macedonia and Thrace their vassal, and expanded far into Anatolia. Many politicians likened to calling the Hellenic Republic the [""Empire of the Greeks""](http://i.imgur.com/rK1B6jn.jpg)


Next was the Roman Republic, which you could consider an [Empire](http://i.imgur.com/8qVo1gy.jpg) by itself, considering the difference between Italian Romans, Faryaban Gulgeans, Ligurians, Sicilians, and Africans.

The [Illyrian Kingdom](http://i.imgur.com/iETo0IY.jpg) is also sizable, consisting of a large chunk of the Balkans.

These three blocs of power all are considered part of the Roman Empire. 

*****

Then there is the curious case of the Most Holy Union. 

The Kingdoms of the Most Holy Union now stand at four, with the Kingdom of Francia, the Kingdom of Aragon, the Kingdom of Lower Britannia, and the Kingdom of the Celts and of Eire. 

But only two of these nations have a direct relationship with Rome. Only the Kingdom of Francia and the Kingdom of Aragon are under direct vassalship of the Roman Empire. 

The kingdom of Lower Britannia is a vassal of the Kingdom of Francia. Does this make it part of the Roman Empire or not?

And what of the Kingdom of the Celts and Eire? As part of the Most Holy Union, they are linked to two, maybe three vassals of Rome. Are they part of the Empire?

[The Most Holy Union](http://i.imgur.com/u2OjeRl.jpg) owns a considerable amount of land, but is a collection of states that have their own relationships with each other and to Rome. The Union itself could be its own Empire, but the Francians and the Aragonese choose to retain their relationship with Rome. And they are absolutely key to Rome's power in the region.

This complex bloc of power in Western Europe puzzled even the officials of the Imperial Senate, and the Emperor. What nations deserved recognition in the Senate, even Bohemia has representation due to their close relationship with the Empire. But the Celts have no representation? The Britons don't as well? This is a question and topic that is hot on the Senate floor, after tax levels are set, and updates from the East are proclamed.

**1187 BC-734 BC The Dark Age**

The Mighty Achaeans, Danaans, Argives sack the mighty city of Troy, scattering its inhabitants all about the Mediterranean. The crushing of this great city brought on a period of chaos and darkness throughout the world. The Sea Peoples, seeing their chance, launched invasion after invasion, destroying the great cities of Hellas, Anatolia, the Levant, and Egypt. 

None were safe as their wrath spread far and wide. 

The survivors from the sacking of Troy fled, one particular party made its way to Latium, in Italia, which would go on to form the city of Rome, a now budding Republic. 

Other survivors settled in Sicilia and Southern Italia. It is here where our story starts.

For the next 400 years, the survivors from Troy made their living, small settlements on the South Eastern portion of the island sprung up, small farming communities and such. Over time these communities became culturally distinct, but all remember their beginnings all those centuries ago.

**734 BC The Founding of the Colony of Syracuse**

As Hellas climbs back out of the Dark Age, and is well into the Archaic age, the Greeks, like the Phoenicians set out to colonize the Mediterranean. Corinthians and Teneans set up the colony of Syracuse, where Archias led the foundation of the colony.

Three important cities were founded around this time, Carthage, about 80 years before Syracuse, a Phoenician colony, Rome, just 20 years earlier than Syracuse, populated by survivors of the Sack of Troy, and Syracuse, a Greek colony. 

These three cities, they stood in harmony with each other as the Western Mediterranean world was more connected and peaceful than the East. 

***********

**734 BC-500 BC The Founding Period**

The City of Syracuse rose to prominence in a period called the **Founding Period**, which lasted from 734 BC, the date the colony was founded, to 500 BC, in which all the settlements in the area recognized the city as the hegemon in the region. 

The unique nature of the colony, which is a Greek city surrounded by descendants from Troy, allowed for a blend in cultures and an acceptance of each other. The more rural Trojans cooperated with the educated and urban Greeks. 

In 500 BC, just nine years after the founding of the Republic of Rome, the King of Syracuse was crowned. Until 500 BC, the communities were led by a mix of tyrants, oligarchies, elected leaders, and hereditary Kings. In the Founding Period, small scale conflict was common, and it was soon understood that for the settlements to thrive, they would have to unite. The leaders of the settlements met in an open plain just outside the Greek Colony. It was here that they would decide their government system.  The King of Syracuse would need to appease all of these different ways of governing if he was to succeed. 


And so, after many weeks of deliberation, the settlements decided on a Monarchy, with an Advisory Council with the leaders of all the communities sitting. All seats, and the King, would be for life. The successor of the King would be hereditary, but the King and Council had to agree on an heir. 

This worked for as the King Agamemnon took the throne, changing his name from Agathocles. The name was meant to evoke power and strong heritage. The Kingdom of Syracuse shared a common heritage, their ancestors fought one another in the great Trojan War, and now they work together for a better tomorrow. 


**500 BC-400 BC Tumultuous First Century**

The government was agreed on, and soon things were put into motion, but whispers from the violent East came through the merchants, the Mighty Persian Empire was encroaching on Greek Land in Ionia, and even launched an invasion of Hellas itself. The great powers of the gods called the Syracuseans to act, as a young commander sent a fleet and hoplite army to participate in the Persian Wars. 

There were 40 Syracusean ships at the Battle of Salamis. The Kingdom's commanders and troops became disillusioned under the command of Spartan Kings, and soon turned their back on the Persian Wars. 

With this, the rise of the Delian League and Peloponnesian League began. The Athenians saw themselves as the masters of Hellas, and tried three times to force Syracuse into their Empire. The Peloponnesian League saw it fit to stymie Athenian influence, and soon war broke out.

The King now, Nestor, who was sympathetic to the Spartan cause, saw it fit to stay out of this war, until the Athenians brought the war to him. Alcibiades, in his conniving and convincing manner, convinced the Athenian Empire to launch a full scale invasion upon the Kingdom of Syracuse, fearing that Syracuse would support the Spartans. 

The [disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Expedition) this invasion brought on to the Athenians essentially ended the war. Nearly every Athenian was killed or captured as the commanders in Athens underestimated the might of the Navy of Syracuse. 


As the century wrapped up, Syracuse saw the defeat of Athens as a sign of things to come, they soon began a military build up, and started expeditions of their own. The Kingdom dominated the Eastern half of the Island, while Carthage dominated the Western Half.


**400 BC-270 BC The Rise of Hiero**

The Kingdom was growing, along with the city of Syracuse, it was a large city, rivaling even Rome, Athens, and Carthage in size. Its ideal location allowed it to facilitate trade between the Eastern and Western Mediterranean. It was the ideal stopping point. 

Rome's conquest of Italy worried the Kingdom of Syracuse, but they soon found themselves allies as General Pyhrrus laid siege to the city in 278 BC. As he was defeated, King Hiero took the throne. 

And this is where the Kingdom of Syracuse lies right now. 


********

The King has a vision for the future, he sees a united Magna Graecia, Southern Italy into his domain, as well as the entire Island of Sicily. The Kingdom of Syracuse would be the bridge between the Ponii, the Greeks, and the Romans.

##**Hellas-Roma**

The Hellenic Republic held power of the Republic of Macedonia and Thrace. Their close ties allowed Hellas to control their politics.

The nations of Hellas-Roma are:

* Republic of Macedonia and Thrace

* Republic of Hellas

* Republic of Rome

* The Thuran Trading Company

##**Most Holy Union**

The Most Holy Union was a relatively new alliance, which the Francian King proposed. The Kingdoms of Aragon, Lower Britannia, and Francia were fiercely Catholic, and banded together to fight Norse Imperialism. Although the newest alliance, the **Most Holy Union** is arguably the most powerful entity in Europe, having defeated the once mighty Saxon Empire in war. 

The nations of the Most Holy Union are: 

* Kingdom of Francia

* Kingdom of Aragon

* Kingdom of Lower Britannia

##**The Kingdom of Illyria**

The Kingdom of Illyria is one of the most loyal vassals of Rome. 

It is not aligned with any of the major power blocs, but has powerful vassals of its own. The Principate of Serbia and the Illyrian Principate in Southern Illyria. These two smaller nations were powerful states in their own right. 

Along with these vassals, the Kingdom of Illyria is in an alliance with the Kingdom of Bohemia, which is recognized by the Roman Empire as the **Empire of Central Europe.**

These close ties make for interesting Senate meetings in the Imperial Senate, and uncomfortable power balances.

When the Empire of the Goths was annexed, a sense of dread fell over the Senate in Rome. More slaves, workers, and money was pumped into the Danube region, the first line defense of Rome lay there.

If the Mongols were to break through, it would be a slow, and drawn out engagement. Immediately the generals of the Roman Empire began to plan contingency plans for combat south of the Danube, if the fortresses fell quickly.

The Imperial Navy, mostly made up of the Thuran Federation's, Roman Republic's, and Hellenic Republic's Navies, absolutely dominated the Mediterranean and Black Seas. 

There are six major naval bases in locations that can strike at any point in the Mediterranean and Black Seas. 

Essentially in order of importance, although they're all important:

* The first one, is the Thuran Straits, a major strait, this is probably the most important money maker of the Empire. The tolls, taxes, and businesses here make enough money alone to fund the entire Imperial Navy. 

* The second one is the Port of Carthage. Seat of power in the province of Africa, it is an important trading port as well as a major military base. Its influence and projection of power is contingent of the city of Carthage's administration of the Maltese islands, where a large portion of military forces reside. It is from Carthage/Malta and Thurii that the South and Central Mediterranean is controlled from. 

* The city of Praesidium, on the northern tip of Sardinia, is the third major hub of military naval ships. This city, whose full name is Praseidium Romae (the defense of Rome), administers all the fleets of the Western Mediterranean and organizes the defense of the capital. 

* The fourth major naval base is the [shipyards of Proconnesus](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWorldPowers/comments/417ncs/the_shipyards_of_proconnesus/). Constructed first by the Republic of Propontis, the Shipyards are situated between the Hellespont and the Bosporus. These shipyards sole purpose is to house fleets of the Aegean Sea and of the Black Sea. From these shipyards, immediate action can be taken in both of these areas. 

* The fifth is the Corinthian Canal. Although the richest port in Hellas is Athens, the Corinthian Canal, constructed by the Lebanese and maintained by the Romans, was a vital military base. Its spot on the Isthmus allows ships to respond to threats in the Aegean Sea and in the Adriatic seas, as well as keep the peace in the Peloponnese and the rest of Hellas. 

* The last, and often forgotten naval base is in the Republic of Cyprus. The port here is situated like a dagger against the Middle East, with capabilities in being able to respond to threats throughout the entire Eastern Mediterranean South of the Aegean Sea.

*The straits were not at all regulated, and so it was a mess of things. I know the Straits at Thurii, an equally important area was well regulated. This area needs some Greeks managing it.*

*The sailors, whose names I could not pronounce, said that a great Empire used to rule here. The Kaiming, but I saw none of that, only violence.

The Roman Empire was divided into three main political factions.

*****

**Hellas-Roma** 

The first, the most powerful and significant of the three, was the Union of Hellas-Roma and its puppets. The Roman Republic, Thuran Federation, and Hellenic Republic were the full member states of the Union of Hellas-Roma, they have fought many wars against threats. History of the alliance went back to the days of King Marcus Saevus, the city-state of Thurii, and the Kingdom of Hellas. The Union of Hellas-Roma has very clear procedures and rules.

Population: ~20.5 million

******

**Illyria-Serbia-Bohemia**

The next one was a loose Union. The Kingdom of Illyria had absorbed the Principate of Serbia, who was in a military alliance with the Kingdom of Bohemia. And thus, a Union was patched together. Commonly known as the [Union of Illyria-Serbia-Bohemia](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWorldPowers/comments/41mhhc/the_union_of_illyriaserbiabohemia/), the alliance was a military pact, with no real heirarchy set in stone. The King of Illyria in Split was clearly the most powerful man in the Union, but his grip on Serbia and Bohemia was very tenuous at best. 

Population: ~ 13 million

*****

**The Most Holy Union**

The last of the Unions of the Empire was the [*Most Holy Union*](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWorldPowers/comments/41xt0v/the_frankish_king_offers_alliance_with_aragon/cz6e2hh). An alliance between the Catholic Kingdoms of Aragon and Francia, this Union was new. It was a cooperation between two religiously similar members of the Roman Empire. 

The two Kingdoms looked to cooperate with each other, seeing as the North Seas of the Norsemen were unavailable for the two Kingdoms to freely travel and trade. 

Population: ~16.6 million

There is road in Rome, going from the Roman Forum, where the buildings of the Republic, markets and baths reside to the Golden Palace. The symbol of the Empire. 

The road is called *Via Victoriarum*, and is lined with enormous Obelisks when the nations of Rome attain victory over another nation.

17 Obelisks stood, with carvings of the great feats of Rome on the sides of the Obelisk, and now this one would stand, making it 18.

The first few were small, with obelisk to the Roman conquest of Aldermis, Albania, and Sicily. These Obelisks stood at a mere 8 feet tall. These wars were for Roman hegemony in Sicily and Italy. 

The next few were the first ""Grand"" Obelisks. The Roman victory against the Empire of the West Maghreb Empire, and the Kingdom of Aragon. These were two wars that put Rome on the map as a major regional power. These obelisks were impressive, standing at 15 feet.

The next two were the wars for Hellas, Roman wars to unite Hellas and reorganize it into a Republic brought them into conflict with the Theban League, and the Aegean Empire. Smaller Obelisks, but standing at 12 feet tall, as they were the symbol of unity between Hellas and Rome. 

The Obelisk that stood for the war against the Iberian Empire stood tall, at 17 feet. It was a monumental occasion for Rome, and cemented the Romans as a major power in the Mediterranean. 

The next three Obelisks stood at 12 feet, representing the wars in the Balkans after the collapse of the Illyrian Empire. Three great Kingdoms fell, Pannonia, Moesia, and Dacia. 

The next Obelisk was the one constructed after the war with the Barbary Sultanate of the Imazighen. It stood at a towering 25 feet. The Obelisk signified the cementing of Rome as the hegemon of the Western Mediterranean. The subsequent collapse of the Sultanate and the Imazighen only cemented this fact.

By far the most glorious Obelisk to date, was the one dedicated to Rome's victory over the Republic of Lebanon. The Republic of Lebanon stood tall, and collasped when they declared war on the Romans. The Lebanese Republic stretched from Egypt, to the Zagros, to Anatolia. This Obelisk stood 30 feet. This signified Rome's dominance over the Mediterranean.

The Obelisk to the war with the Knights of Jupiter stood by the one for the Republic of Lebanon, it stood at 18 feet, as it was a culmination of the resilience of Rome. In a little more than 30 years, Rome fought wars with three of the mightiest nations in the Mediterranean, and came away victorious in each of them.

The next major conflict that Rome had was against the Golden Horde, which tested the might of Rome. The Roman Empire put hundreds of thousands of men in the field as part of the Union of Hellas-Roma. The Romans were victorious in pushing the Horde back, and crushing the Fury of the Horde with the Frankish Empire. This Obelisk stood at 45 feet. 

Few regional wars, mostly ones against the small Ligurian Empire sparked up. Rome was victorious, and constructed an 8 foot obelisk in honor of the victory, and finally integration of the Italian Peninsula was complete. 

The next Obelisk was a major one, commemorating the war agains the Franks, in which Rome made them a vassal, and the Empire was made lord of all of Francia. This Obelisk stood at 22 feet.

The last one was the Obelisk for the Jewish Republic of Yashou. It stood at 20 feet, and commemorates the might of the Roman Navy and the securing of the Mediterranean as the Roman Lake.

He was in shock. He ran to the Golden Palace, where the new Imperator was notified of his arrival. He got an appointment immediately.

As they dined over wine, Clodius told him of the wonders of the East, and presented him the translated works of the Far East. The Imperator ran his fingers over the silk brought over from the East, and was presented with a toga of silk. 

Exotic tea was presented from the East, and records of the booms of the wars in Kaiming were told.

Octavian observed sketches of Nipponese cities and buildings and was taken aback at how similar the architecture was. It didn't seem possible to him.

With the occupation complete, and Roman troops on the Balearics, the Admare moved to meet the Republic of Yashou's ships off the coast of Aragon, near Valencia. 

 8 Octeres, 7 Baghlah, 15 Hexaremes, 54 Sambuks, 35 Ghanjah, 35 Heavy Dromon, 102 Normal Dromon, 15 Escort Dromon stationed at Balears set sail for the Kingdom of Aragon. They would meet 9 Heavy Dromon and 22 Normal Dromon. 

Sailing toward Valencia was Admiral Hamir, with an overwhelming navy of 61 Cogs, 10 Knarrs, 7 Karves, 34 Longships, 7 Byrdings, 5 Septareme, 8 Hexareme, 2 Sambuks, 4 Ghanjah and 16 Baghlahs armed with Harpaxes, Mangonels, Scorpios and Yashouan Flame siphons.

The Romans saw their overwhelming numbers and dispatched their fleet to engage. The Dromon would stick close to the coast, while the Dhows would attack from the ocean, a typical Naval strategy.


Yashou's ships were flexible, and most of their fleet could fight both on the open water and the coast, and so, Admiral Hamir had a plan.

He would sail on the open water, away from the Dromon, and would engage Roman Dhows. Cogs, Knarrs, Karves, Longships were all overwhelming for the Baghlahs, Ghanjahs and Sambuks.

The Admare of the Roman navy watched in horror as his dhows burned, he pulled them back but the Cogs were able to use their Harpax to prevent them from escaping. 

Of the open water fleet, only 4 Baghlahs, 32 Sambuks and 12 Ghanjah escaped without harm. They fled behind the Dromon, where a different type of battle would commence. 

The Romans were very good at close quarters fighting, and so Admiral Hamir knew he had to use every advantage, so he would use his ships superior speed and flexibility to keep out of range of the Roman Dromon. 

He would draw out a squadron of Dromon, and surround and capture or sink the ships. 

This worked for a long time, but the Admiral knew he would not win the battle this way. The Roman commander was clever and caught onto the plan, he pulled back his ships, and this started a long standoff. The Roman commander reorganized his ships, and sent 50 Normal Dromon back to the Balearics. They would come back from the Balearics and assault the Yashouan Navy from the rear. 


******

Soon, the Romans attacked, as the Admare received word of his ships coming from the Balearics, he surged his fleet foward, putting his Heavy Dromon and Hexaremes in the front. Admiral Hamir was unprepared for such an assault, and reformed his navy to withstand the attack. The siphons were filled and Yashouan Flame engulfed the Roman Fleet. Many ships burned, but the determination of the Roman ships and marines made this a moot point. Flaming ships slammed into the Yashouan Navy and their ships burned as well.

When 50 more Normal Dromon arrived, the Admiral knew he was finished and retreated. He would head back to Yashou to report what had happened. 

The Roman Navy sustained heavy losses, losing nearly 150 total ships, half of their fleet. Most burnt by the Flame of the Yashouans. 

Only 4 Octeres, 3 Baghlah, 7 Hexaremes,  26 Sambuks and 12 Ghanjah, 22 heavy Dromon, 9 Escort Dromon, 68 Normal Dromon remained.

Instead of modeling the Republic after the Hellenic or Roman Republics, the Kingdom of Illyria and Hellenic Republic decided to only have a Senate system.

There would be 200 members of the Senate of Macedonia and Thrace. 100 of them would be of the noble families of the Aristocrats, the other 100 would be voted on by region every five years to represent Thracian and Macedonian interests in the Senate. 

The Kingdom of Illyria, more favored toward a more stable head of government, would propose a *Dux*. A man selected by the Senate to lead the nation until death. 

The *Dux* would make movements for laws, and set policy for the Republic. The Senate would then vote on these laws. A simple majority vote would allow for the Senate to veto a motion, while a 66% vote would allow a motion to pass completely.

Two from the West, and two from the East.

The Ducal Fleet was a powerful one, having more heavy ships than the Romans had ever dealt with. They had been able to surprise and overwhelm the Roman Fleet just a few months before, sinking most of the Dhow Fleet of the Imperial Navy.

33 cogs, 21 septaremes, 14 baghlahs 8 sambuks, 4 ganjahs held the islands. The Jewish Forces of Thurii were made up of 10 baghlahs, 4 heavy dromon, 10 normal Dromon, 5 light Dromon.

The alarms were sounded as the Francian Blockade, with the remains of the dhow fleet approached. 15 Ghanjah, 26 Sambuks, 6 Baghlahs sailed to the Balearics. To their North-East, 40 Normal Dromon and 10 Heavy Dromon made their way toward the Balearics. The 21 Septaremes lead the way to combat the ships, the massive and cumbersome ships scattered the Dhow fleet, where the dhows of the Thuran Navy and the Ducal Fleet combated them. Fighting was fierce, but the Cogs of the Ducal fleet were able to trap a lot of the ships and capture them. The Dromon and Septaremes crashed into each other. The heavier ships and the experienced Dromon of the Thuran fleet gave them the upperhand, but it was short lived. Fighting continued for half the day until reinforcements arrived. 

Intelligence reached the Admiral of the Ducal fleet saying that there was a large Roman Fleet coming from the South. 61 more ships arrived to support the battle. 1 Baghlah, 40 Sambuks, and 20 Ghanjahs moved to aid the dhows. These reinforcements allowed the Romans to gain the upperhand, sinking some of the Dromon and damaging some of the Cogs. The sun was setting, and the Ducal forces regrouped near the islands as the Romans regrouped as well.

The first day of fighting was over.

The Ducal fleet suffered 4 Cogs sunk, and a Baghlah was damaged beyond repair. They did not lose a single Septareme. 

The Jewish Thuran Fleet lost half of their Normal Dromon. 

As daybreak happened, the Roman Galley fleet was seen in the distance. 10 Octeres, 15 Hexaremes, 40 Heavy Dromon, 75 Normal Dromon, and 25 Escort Dromon. The Admiral moved to shift his focus, most of his cogs would still be dedicated to the West, but his Septaremes, and the Dromon of the Balearics would be forced to engage this fleet. 

While Septaremes were nearly indestructible to lighter ships, this was not the case with this fleet. The Romans lead with their heavy ships, so 10 Octeres, 15 Hexaremes, and 40 Heavy Dromon smashed into Septaremes. The thousands of marines boared the ships and fighting was fierce. The Yashouans unleashed their Greek Fire, felling 2 Octeres, but suffering themselves. The Escort and Normal Dromon looped around and rammed the northern Flank as well as started to land on the shores of the Balearic Islands. 

5 Octeres disengaged and supported this endeavor. 

Essentially surrounded, the Jewish Balearic Fleet and the Ducal Fleet saw that they were at a disadvantage in numbers, and position. The Admiral put out the order to punch a whole through the line of the Roman fleet so as many ships could escape as possible.

10 Septaremes lead the way, with the remaining Dromon, and smashed through the Dhows to the south. 

The Jewish forces sustained heavy casualties, as Roman Dromon and Octeres were able to use Harpax to trap ships and capture them. 

Only 32 Ships of the Ducal Fleet escaped, 20 Cogs with 12 of them heavily damaged, 10 Baghlahs, 6 Yashouan and 4 Thuran, 2 Sambuks and 4 Ghanjah limped away. They were scattered across the southern portion of the Mediterranean.

We are getting to that time in history where some nations---not nameing and nations in particular---may start going over the large oceans, the Pacific and Atlantic, to start colonies for themselves. 

It's not like colonies are a new thing in this game. Saxony in particular has colonies all over the North and Baltic Seas. in OTL, the Greek city-states, and Phoenicians colonized much of the Mediterranean. One Phoenician colony was the rival to the Roman Republic.

But colonies, that are oceans away are disconnected from their mainland counterparts except for some infrastructure and culture. 

For example if colonies in America are attacked, they'd need to rely on only the population of those colonies. Expansions from colonies would also be heavily scrutinized, due to the difficulty of doing it.


On the flipside, colonies that declare war could have large amounts of soldiers from their mother nation to rely on.
Mother nations can garrison troops, but it would take away from the total amount of troops they can rise in times of war in their homeland.


There will also be a significant mobilization delay for transporting troops across large bodies of water.

The Imperator of the Roman Empire looked at the map that was presented to him in the court. He just looked, thinking of what the chances were of getting to Serica by going West. 

He thought of the nations to his south, Essinia, Egypt and Persia, and how much trouble it was to go through those nations. How difficult could it really be to just go West until them meet Serica. 

The prospect was tempting, but there were other things to worry about, like the Frankish war, and the Muscovite war for succession. 

He knew if Rome wanted to remain on top, he could not worry himself with the slim chance that this was indeed true. Still, it must be noted, and it was put in his quarters. 

He called his assistants to take the map away, and hung it on the wall, with the title, **Mappa Mundi**.

**1214 CE**


The war had stagnated, and the Romans had been pushed back. The Imperial generals came together at the Balearic Islands as to suggest exactly what to do. 

They much win a decisive victory and force the Emperor to capitulate, but they also need it to happen as soon as possible. 

[Thuran military](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWorldPowers/comments/3wbgds/frankish_counteroffensive/cxwiwgv?context=3) commanders proposed a daring plan, an assault on Western Francia by sailing through the Pillars of Heracles. 

The Roman Navy would divert over 15,000 troops, a Legion and Minor Legion to be shipped over to the other side of Francia, and as that happens, the Roman Empire would consolidate the armies in Southern Francia and push toward the capital of the Empire. Support forces would be a plenty with additional Knights of Jupiter pouring through Augelogne. 

This three pronged attack would hopefully force the Franks to surrender.

The fleet would consist of Balinger Ships, Muriophorio barges escorted by 25 Heavy Dromon, 30 Normal Dromon, 40 Escort Dromon, 25 Sambuks, 30 Ghanjahs and a Baghlah command ship. The Dromons would turn back at the Pillars. 

The nations who controls Gibraltar is welcome to try and stop the fleet, but the Romans would be willing to pay the toll to get through. 

This expedition was expensive, and costly, but the victory from this daring attack would make the ones involved legends. 

Consolidation was done, and 45,000 troops, 3 Legions, 2 Minor Legions, and 6,000 Equites would march from the south. 

From Augelogne, the full might of the Knights of Jupiter, 15,000 Horses, a Legion and a Minor Legion would march into Francia, totaling 30,000 troops.

Despite its name, the Roman Republic, the core of the Empire, does not run the Empire, and the Republic must bend to the will of the Empire.

Although the nations are self-governing, the Empire asserts its will over all foreign policy whenever possible. 

Each nation has its own traditions in military, but the Empire takes command over all. All nations are told clearly that to become part of the Empire, they must give up certain freedoms, or they will not benefit from the privileges of the Empire.

One thing that is abundantly true is that all citizens of constituent nations are citizens of the Roman Empire. Because of this, nearly every citizen is eligible to be drafted into the Imperial Military. 

The Imperial Military is broken down into the Army, Cavalry, and Navy. 

Each of these divisions are broken down further.

******

**The Roman Navy**

The Navy is perhaps the oldest and most respected branch of the Roman Military. It has three branches:

* The Galley Fleet

* The Cargo Fleet

* The Dhow Fleet

All three of these fleets are lead by an *Imperator ad Mare*, or *Admare*. 

**The Galley Fleet**

Comprised of mostly Dromon, the Galley fleet is by far the most powerful and respected branch of the Imperial Fleet. 

* The smallest class of Dromon are small galleys, called the *Parva Navis*, have 15 marines. These are used for scouting missions and support roles. They do not come armed with a spur or a ram, but with mounted Oxybeles. These ships have one lateen sail.

* The next class of Dromon is the *Levis Navis*. It has 28 marines.  This is a light combat ship. They are used as escorts. They are armed with spurs, ram and mounted Scorpio that uses a harpax to pull ships close to them. 

* The next class of Dromon, by far the most common one, is the *Normalis Navis* class Dromon. They have 30 marines. These Dromon are the main combat ships of the Roman Navy. They are armed with spurs, a ram and a mounted mangonel on the stern and a mounted Ballista on the front. The ballista can use a harpax to pull ships close to them. These ships have multiple masts and lateen sails.

* The largest class of Dromon are called the *Gravis Navis*. They are large ships, having 70 marines. These are common ships, but not as common as the *Normalis Navis*. They are considered heavy combat ships and able to hold their own against larger ships. They are armed with a ram, spurs, and 2 mounted Ballistae in the back of the ship. which can be armed with the harpax which is used to pull ships close to board and a mangonel toward the stern of the ship.

* The *Hexareme* is a capital ship, it holds 120 marines. Every fleet has a few Hexaremes. They are one of the heaviest combat ships in the Mediterranean. They are armed with rams coated in steel, and spurs, and with two mangonels on the stern of the ship and two Ballistae on the bow of the ship, which can use harpax.

* The *Octere* is the heaviest ship of the Roman Navy by far. It dwarfs any ship that any other nation can put on the water. Although it is huge, it can move at great speeds and is a battle changer on the water. The Octere carries an enormous 1,100 marines. The ship has rams on the front, with spurs. The Octere also has two ballistae in the front of the ship and two Mangonels at the rear of the ship. The ship also holds many mounted oxybeles on the sides of the ship and four scorpio on each side of the ship.

The Mangonel is used to fire projectiles at other ships. They are mostly stones, but recently, marines have been putting jars of naphtha on the mangonels and launching them. 

The marines of the ships are split, with 75% of the marines being Legionnaries, and 25% of the marines being Crossbowmen.  

**The Cargo Fleet**

This fleet is probably the most important, as it covers all the logistical areas for conflicts overseas. Only a few escort Dromon and lighter dhows in its command. The cargo fleet is comprised mostly of Phortegoi barges, Muriophorio ships, and Balinger ships. 

* The Phortegoi barge is probably the most common cargo ship in the cargo fleet. This ship is used to transport food and supplies to combat fleets. 

* The Muriophorio is an enormous ship, ideal for bringing enormous amounts of supplies and food to support sustained campaigns in foreign lands. You always know a campaign is serious when these ships are with the fleet.

* The Balinger ship is the transport ship of the Roman Navy. These ships, instead of carrying supplies, carry soldiers of the Empire. They are swift, maneuverable and carry Roman troops for extended campaigns. 

**The Dhow Fleet**

The Dhow fleet of the Empire is the smallest of the branches, it is based on intelligence and flexibility moreso than combat. Even so, the Dhow fleets have had some crushing victories against other nation's navies. 


* [Class *Navigium Normalis*](http://www.lacornamusa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sambuk.jpg) -- Sambuk Dhow design. This ship has mounted Scorpio on it with a crew of about 20 fighting men. These men for battle would be adorned in Legionnaire gear, although they were armed with only a Crossbow and Migration Period Sword. 

* [Class *Navigium Gravis*](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Kotia-1909.jpg) -- Ghanjah Dhows design. This ship is about 100 feet long with a crew of about 45 people. It has mounted on it a Heavy Ballista as well as a mangonel. adorned in Legionnaire gear, although they were armed with only a Crossbow and Migration Period Sword.

The largest of the ships, with 100 men manning these ships, these ships were the heaviest combat ships the Romans had to offer second only to the *Octere*. They are armed with two ballistae, and a mangonel and the men, during battle, are adorned in Legionnaire gear, although they were armed with only a Crossbow and Migration Period Sword.

For all of these ships, each one has a captain, the Admare of the fleet is the captain of the flagship.

**The Roman Army**

The Roman army is what is used to control the occupied provinces of the Empire, and the one to conduct campaigns in other nations. 

The Roman army is completely levied, with all citizens eligible to join. 

The weapons and armor were steel, the shields were wood braced with steel. All men were clad in armor of greaves, manicae, Lamellar armor, ringmail gauntlets, helms, chainmail, with Ushankas, and fur pants and clothes for Northern Campaigns. 

The Roman Army has three branches:

* The Roman Legion

* The Minor Legion

* The Imperium Legion

The *Imperator Terrae* is the commanders of the Roman army. 

Their are two major divisions and one new division of the Roman army. 

**The Legion**

The Roman Legion, still the backbone of the Roman army, consisted of 9,000 men, 5,000 Legionnaires, 3,000 Spearman, and 1,000 Equites. Each division is commanded by a Centurion.

Legionaries would be armed migration period swords, kite shields, 2 spiculum javelins, and a gladius shortsword.

The Spearmen held menaulion spears, with kite shields and a gladius shortsword.

The Equites marched on Kharaangar steeds, barded in leather, carrying lances, kite shields, maces, a gladius shortsword, 2 spiculum javelins on an arched saddle with stirrups.

**The Minor Legion**

The Minor Legion is the support wing of the Roman army. They are made up of 6,000 men, 4,000 Pikemen and 2,000 Crossbowmen.

The Pikemen were armed with steel Pikes and a gladius shortsword, and a small steel braced round shield.

The Crossbowmen had crossbows, and a gladius shortsword.

**The Imperium Legion**

A group of 5,000 professional soldiers that are station in Rome. They are Legionnaries that have training in using horses and crossbows. They are stationed in Rome.

*******

**The Roman Cavalry**

Probably the division that has the newest branch to it. For a long time, the Cavalry of the Roman army has been an afterthought, with the Equitati divisions being mostly in support roles. But now times are different, and an entire division of the Roman military is required. 

The Cavalry is lead by an *Imperator Equitati*

The Roman Cavalry has three branches:

* Equites Maximi

* Equitati

* The Knights of Jupiter

All Cavalry rode on Kharaangar steeds, barded in leather, carrying lances, kite shields, maces, a gladius shortsword, 2 spiculum javelins on an arched saddle with stirrups.

**Equites Maximi**

An Elite unite of 2,000 men on horses. These men were the elite guard of the commander. 

**Equitati Division**

The main part of the Cavalry, 1 Equitati Division is 6,000 Horses, but is broken down into 10 divisions of 600 Horses.

These are lighter Cavalry, with Lighter lances, small circular wood shields, and a spiculum Javelin. The Equitati are still the main cavalry force of the Roman Empire, and they are built on swiftness and scouting. 

**The Knights of Jupiter**

The Knights of Jupiter is a martial order, with some 25,000 Knights at their disposal, these Knights are not standing, and do their civic and religious duties during peacetime.

* The Knights is lead by the Grandmaster, who held absolute authority on the actions of the Knights of Jupiter. As of now, the Grandmaster is subservient to the Roman Imperator Omnis. 

* Under the Grandmaster are 8 Senior Knights Superior. These men are the only ones that are eligible to become the future Grandmaster. One of these men is selected to be the strategos of the Knights of Jupiter.

* Below the Senior Knights Superior are the Knights Superior. These are the officers of the cavalry division of the Knights of Jupiter.

* Junior Knights are fully fledged Knights, and make up most of the order. Of 25,000 Knights, 99% of the Knights are Junior Knights. 

The Knights of Jupiter, a Greek entity, are often called Cataphracts as they are the heaviest and best trained of the Roman Cavalry. ",HistoricalWorldPowers,Roman Army Makeup,https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWorldPowers/comments/3vd7h3/roman_army_makeup/

At the top, is the Imperator Omnis. The Emperor of All, his word is the final say on all matters of the Empire. He is advised, and can be overridden by the Imperial Senate, consisting of 50 Senators from each nation of the Empire. The Imperial Senate must come to a 66% vote to override the Imperator Omnis' word.

The Imperator Omnis is responsible for selecting his successor, and if he cannot, the Imperial Senate will select one for him. The position is not hereditary, but you will see a few families dominate the position. 

The Roman Empire's capital is Rome, and its bureaucracy, Senate Chambers, and Imperator reside in the Golden Palace Complex, which is situated on a northern hill of Rome, overlooking the city. 

The official language of the Roman Empire is Latin, but many languages are spoken, and most noblemen are bilingual in their native language and Latin. 

The Nations that are bound to the Empire are the following:

* The Roman Republic - Royal Purple

* The Kingdom of Illyria - Orange

* The Kingdom of Aragon - Blue in Iberia

* The County of Valencia - Purple in Iberia

* The Kingdom of Augelogne - Purple in France

* The Serbian Principate - Light Green

* The Hellenic Republic - Yellow

[Map](http://i.imgur.com/dolCMXN.jpg)

The Imperator Omnis appoints **proconsuls** to each nation. These proconsuls serve for five years and hold the power to override the clients actions. Because the nations are rather autonomous, this is a way to watch these nations. The proconsuls hold and represent the authority of Rome.

******

**Roman Republic**

The Roman Republic, based out of Rome, consists of all the land in Italy, Sicily, Carthage, Corsica, and Sardinia except for the lands held by the Federation of Thurii. The Roman Republic is run by on terms of five years. Three Tribunes are elected from male citizens over the age of 21 in each region, totaling 150 Tribunes. One tribune must be a noble family, and the other two are Tribunes of the Plebs. The Tribunes then select from their ranks the **Dux Tribunorum**, who leads sessions in the hall of Tribunes.  The Tribunes role in the Republic's government day to day operations is to manage domestic policy, but perhaps their most important role is the selection of Consuls.

The two Consuls of Rome are selected by the Tribunes, and they set the policy foreign and domestic. The Consuls are assisted by four Praetors. These six men are able to convene Tribunal and Senate sessions.

The Senate is the Council of 100 of the richest men in Rome. They hold the keys to the finances of the Republic, it is almost impossible to get anything done without the Senate's approval even though they hold no official power in governing. The only official power the Senate has is the ability to veto any Consul's motion with a 66% vote against him.

The Senate, once every 10 years, selects the Primus Civis among them. This man is the first speaker of the Senate after the Consuls. 

Other positions are the Censors, who conduct censuses every five years and collect taxes. 

Citizens of the Roman Republic are expected to know how to speak Latin and Greek.

******

**Hellenic Republic**

The Hellenic Republic is the second member of the Empire, based out of Athens. 

The Hellenic Republic functions exactly as the Roman one does. They model themselves after the Roman form of government. The only difference is the Hellenic Republic has no Dux Tribunorum or Primus Civis and their Tribunal Council is only 57 strong. 

The Hellenic Republic has two client Republics on the Island of Rhodes, and the Island of Cyprus.

**Serbian Principate**

The Serbian Principate has all the procedures and institutions of the Hellenic Republic. The positions are given Slavic names.The Serbs are not governed by their Republic, but by a **Princeps**, a man with absolute authority. The Senate and Tribunal Council in Serbia are advisory councils. Due to the small nature of Serbia, the nation runs smoothly under these rules.

Citizens of the Serbian Principate are expected to know how to speak Serbian and Latin.

*****

**Kingdom of Illyria**

The Kingdom of Illyria, with their capital at Split, is now the last vestige of the great Illyrian Empire. Ruled by the King of Illyria, the family has been in power, now propped up by the Romans, since the days of the Empire. The family is beloved, and their administration of their kingdom operates as it has for some time. The Kingdom has adopted some bureaucratic titles from the Romans but the King and his family still retain most of the control of the nation. 

The Illyrian Kingdom has a small autonomous region just south of it with the same government system as the Serbian Principate.

As the Kingdom is very new, the Romans take most of the administrative duties.

**The County of Valencia**


The County of Valencia is a small nation ruled by a Count from the city of Valencia. The small nation is majority Christian, and developed a sense of separation from the rest of the Crusader state of Aragon.

Gaining independence than pledging fealty directly to Rome, the County of Valencia takes orders directly from the Imperator. This strange relationship makes it a less-self governing, but more unique from its neighbor, the Kingdom of Aragon.

**The Kingdom of Augelogne**

Augelogne is governed from Locarno.

Augelogne is the result of a union with the many small counties and baronies which reside in the area. After Phillippe I united the nations, the people have slowly adapted and expanded to the harsh mountain territory. Fearing Francia, the nation seeked closer ties to the Roman Empire, however due to it's hard to scale terrain, Latin doesn't spread or stick too quickly. However, thanks to church services, most people can understand the basics.

Their citizens are expected to speak French and Latin

**The Relationship between the Roman Empire and the Thuran Federation.**

The Thuran Federation and Rome have always had a very close relationship. The Thuran Federation is a collection of Federated states that have complete and total independence from Rome. They elect their own leaders, and conduct their own diplomacy. Rome and Thurii are bound under the laws of the Union of Hellas Roma, which gives them the means to work together as one against external threats.

The Knights, a martial order, was dethroned from power as the true power behind the nation was in the Balkans. The newly crowned Elijos of the Balkan Dominion launched an invasion of the Ottoman Sultanate. 

As the Roman contingent defeated the Turks in Syria, and Balkan forces invading the Pontic match, the Ottoman Empire collapsed. And for a brief moment, it seemed the newly formed Balkan Dominion would be a force to be reckoned with. 

It was not so. The Balkan Dominion had more trouble controlling its territory than expected. Turkish uprisings and raids on the Pontic March allowed forced the new nation to devote most of its strained resources to retaining control of the nation. 

The Tyrant Elijos, Lord of the Balkan Dominion, soon found himself with trouble at home, as the various Balkan tribes and the Greeks of Macedonia, and Thrace fought with each other. They were subservient to the Lord, but their hatred and resentment toward each other was something that could not be rectified. 

In a stunning move, with Hellenic support, the Knights of Jupiter mustered a rebellious army and invaded the core lands of Elijos. And the Balkan Dominion was no more. 

As the Pontic March's control was lost, the Thracians and Macedonians looked for independence. They attacked the Knights of Jupiter, remembering their follies.

The Grandmaster of the Order fled with 20,000 Knights into the Hellenic Republic. The Hellenic Republic declared a state of emergency to deal with the Knights and settled them in camps in Thessaly.

The Balkan Dominion was split into small states.

The Kingdom of Macedonia- Once an independent Kingdom after the fall of the old Hellenic Kingdom, the Knights of Jupiter crushed Macedonia and incorporated them into their Domain.

Most men of Macedonia hold onto their pagan roots, but Catholic communities survived. 

The Kingdom of Thrace- The core areas of the Knights of Jupiter, the area is fiercely conservative in pagan religions. The ancestral capital of the Knights of Jupiter, Thessalonika, is the capital. 

The Republic of Propontus and Bospor- The newest of the nations, the Kingdom of Propontus and Bospor held onto the Bosporus and Hellespont territories. The area is a mix of Muslims, Catholics, Pagans and Sofists. 

The Confederation of the Balkans- The confederation of the Balkans is the rump state of the Balkan Dominion. The Tyrant Elijos and his line controlled it, but the squabbling lords of the Balkans made it a weak and disjointed Confederacy.

[M] Going for 5 expansions this week.


With the blessing of the Church, and the submission of the Triumvirs of the Catholic State of Aragon, the Roman Empire emptied their crowded cities, and flooded the Aragonese coasts and lands with settlers. The armies of Rome marched through the countryside, building roads, bases, fortifications, incorporating many areas into the Roman Empire. 

The war torn land was gracious for the fresh labor and infrastructure, and praised the Lord for their interference. 

The Imperator Omnis Lucius ordered the Triumvirs be turned into regional governors of Aragon, and the Empire governed Aragon itself. 

Soon, the Imperator selected a royal family, one of the most powerful families in Rome, with ties to the ancient Kingdom of Aragon, and declared him King of Aragon.

The people watched as he was crowned King by the Pope Alexander himself, and the Kingdom of Aragon was reborn once again.

[M] First map will be the expansion, next map will be the claims of the Kingdom of Aragon whether they are controlled by them or not.

The Gulgean King knew his realm was crumbling, the marge of Augelogne had pushed them to further cramped places. The Faryaban people were disgruntled, but they still lived in peace with each other. 

They smoked, they ate and they drank. The Imperator asked for visions and advice from the old king, as his predecessor had.

The king laughed, commenting how funny it was that the mighty Emperor of the Romans had come to the weak king of Gulgea for advice. 

He took out many codices, and written on them in Bacada script was the history of the Kingdom of Gulgea, he gave them to the Imperator as a gift. He then told him that he must continue West, for East has only given him war. The Roman Empire would triumph there as the people were loyal to Rome.

This was puzzling, the people of the West, the Franks, the Aquitaini, and the people of Augelogne were very independent peoples. The Iberians though had been a mess of warring states for the last two centuries. 

The Imperator and the King spoke well into the night, speaking of Iberia.

The next week he returned to Rome, and the Pope Alexander was waiting for him in his office. An unexpected visit from the ""king"" of the island of Ilva, officially in Roman records as ""New Aragon,"" Lucius Aurelius sat down and asked him what his business was.

The Pope rarely came to Rome, preferring to stay on Ilva and in the Frankish Empire, where he crowned Emperors and Kings.

Alexander stated that there was an issue that needed to be addressed Many letters had been sent to the Frankish Empire, urging them to act. With the Iberian Penisula in shambles, split into small Kingdoms, the Pope had been lobbying for a nation to absorb the Crusader State in Iberia. The State calls itself Aragon, and wishes to take up the mantle of the Catalunian Empire. The Pope had seen small Roman settlements on the coast, and just wished for the Romans to throw their full weight behind the Crusader State, to assert their claims over Iberia, and bring peace.

Alexander offered Lucius his full blessings in doing whatever needed to be done to achieve this.

The Roman Empire was asked to absorb the Seljuk Sultanate in Anatolia and the Knights of Jupiter were approved to join the Union of Hellas-Roma.

While this may all seem straightforward, it actually is quite complicated and is not very clear, so I hope this clears things up.

I will start with the Roman Empire, which is fairly straight forward.

The Empire is actually a collection of states under the authority of the Empire. The Roman Republic is the governing state of the Empire and delegates proconsuls to manage the different states of the Empire.

The Roman Empire is comprised of: 

* The Roman Republic

* The Hellenic Republic

* The Seljuk Sultanate

* The Kingdom of Illyria

* Serbian Principate 

These states are all autonomous and essentially independent, but all answer to the authority of the Empire.

The other web of alliances is the Union of Hellas-Roma, the two original members were the Roman Republic and Thurii. The Union of Hellas-Roma is an economic and military agreement to defend each other. While there are more terms, I will not get into them.

Any resolution of the Union of Hellas-Roma must have a unanimous consensus for a full Union response. To join the Union, the voting members must vote them in by simple 50% majority vote. The Union may add observer states as well, who attend meetings but don't have a vote in the matters at hand. 

The Union of Hellas-Roma is comprised of:

* The Roman Republic
* The Hellenic Republic
* The Thuran Federation
* The Knights of Jupiter
* The Kingdom of Illyria (observer only)

* The four nations would meet in the central location of Dumas to discuss and come to resolutions concerning the four nations. Two observer nations would be present, delegates of the Kingdom of Illyria and the Serbian Principate would observe but have no votes.

* The language of Latin would be adopted.

* Catholics will be given the free movement they have been denied.

* The long sought after territories at the mouth of the Danube River will be ceded to the Thuran Federation.

* Sweeping government reforms of the Knights of Jupiter are expected.

I've been noticing some trends over the past 2 weeks concerning wars. There are two ways to do wars, you can role play it or you can calculate it.

This next few things are general guidelines for conducting yourself:

* When you RP a war, all parties must be willing to put in the time to complete the war. 

* When you RP a war, all parties should be involved in discussing acceptable and realistic outcomes for all parties. There is a great tool in IRC for doing this. Utilize it.

* Keep things plausible and realistic.

* RP wars are supposed to be fun for both parties, so if you have to sacrifice certain nation-goals for the sake of fun then that should be fine.

* If no agreement can be made, just calculate the conflict. It's that simple. Once the calculated war is finished, the results are final and not up for discussion.

* Don't take this so seriously, it's a game, and don't take things people do in game personally.

It did not help that the Government was slow to relieve troops of their duty and resettle them. So when they finally were discharged, the legionnaires felt they had earned a lot more cash then they were paid.

The difference was enormous, but Caesar and Agrippa covered it, hoping that the Senate and Tribunal Council would repay them with titles. Both of the men were wrong.

The Roman Navy was able to win a crushing victory at Melos, sinking 50 Lebanese Dromon and breaking their hegemony over the South Aegean Sea. The Thuran fleet was able to surround and smash the Lebanese Navy at Lemnos, sinking 75 more Lebanese Dromon. 

Lebanese hegemony over the seas was broken, and the Union of Hellas-Roma was dominant. While restricting movement, the Lebanese troops trapped in Hellas were starved out. When the Hellenic and Roman armies moved to engage the troops, they faced a starving and despondent army.

**Illyria**

Alas, the drums of war beat harder then ever before. Agrippa arrived from Ingria to Illyria to a massive army the command of the Roman forces in Illyria.

20,000 Bulgarian tribesmen, newly equiped with the pikes, steel armor and Kharaangar bows of the Knights, marched with 5,000 knights marched on Illyria, a nation that has never been conquered since its inception. A nation that destroyed the Polish Empire and the Kharaangar hordes. An Illyrian-Roman force marched south to battle the Knights. 31,200 men--18,000 Legionnaires, 6,000 Crossbowmen, and 7,200 Equites went out to meet them. The Roman and Illyrian troops clashed with the knights.

Crossbow bolts and arrows flew, men died, as the Roman Legions advanced toward the Bulgarians. As they got close enough, the Pikes were lined up, and the Romans let their Spicula fly. Hundreds of javelins flew, piercing the armor of the Bulgarians. As the Legionnaires marched forward, the pikes did nothing as the steadily approaching Romans clashed.

Legionnaire combat was well suited for a close encounter, and the Bulgarians were forced to withdraw to use their bows once again. The Equites charged at this moment, while the Bulgarians could not switch from their Bows to their pikes, and the route was on.

The men retreated back into Knights territory, and the first engagement between the Knights and Rome/Illyria went as expected. 

*****

**Epirus**

Word of the Roman victory in Illyria reached the coalition in Epirus by pigeon messenger. This energized the massive army.

This army was made up of 20,000 Iberian Mercenaries, 17,000 Roman Legionnaires, 10,000 Cyrenese Hoplites and the 7,000 Equites.

They faced off against an enormous Jupiter force of 50,000 men. 

The heavy forces clashed together. Fighting was fierce and if it was only battle weary Romans fighting, the Knights would have decisively won the day. The mercenaries, fresh and well trained, were able to provide the support they needed. The Knights were driven back, albeit with minimal losses. The army of the Romans did not pursue, as the mercenaries decided to make camp.

Alas, the Knights were persistent and charged back, wreaking havoc among the camp. The mercenaries were crushed and fled away from the camp. The Romans were able to retreat and regroup as the Equites held off the Knights.

Rome had been soundly beaten, but the war was not over.

**Hellas**

12,000 Legionnaires with 10,000 Iberian Mercenaries made camp outside of Thermopylae. The Lebanese forces there would stay put. The other 10,000 mercenaries would be loaded up onto the Roman Muriophorio, escorted by the Roman Dromon fleet, and sent to lay siege to Thessalonika.

17,000 legionnaires and 7,000 Equites, with 13,000 Crossbowmen monitored the Lebanese forces at the Isthmus. 6,000 Thuran soldiers arrived to reinforce Athens.

* Each region, by votes of their citizens, elect three Tribunes, who serve for five years. Two of the Tribunes must be of the Plebeian class while the Third Tribune must be of the Patrician Class. The Tribunes essentially talked of issues regarding the people. That is where their power comes from. They meet in the [Tribunal Council](https://dj008.k12.sd.us/Old%20Website%20Materials/reading/The%20Mausoleum%20at%20Halicarnassus/halicarnassus6.gif) to discuss policy and settle issues domestically. The most important role of the Tribunes is that they elect the two consuls, which brings me to those guys.

* Their are two consuls and they are the people who set policy. Because the tribunes select the consuls, the two men who are selected often have the backing of the Tribunes. One consul dictates Foreign policy, and the other dictates domestic policy. Consuls cannot serve more than one term in a row.

* The Senate, made up of 100 patrician members, is by far the most aristocratic part of the Republic. They meet in the [Senate Chamber](http://images.everytrail.com/pics/fullsize/1836715-Vittoriano.jpg). Their power is great, as they have the power to veto any motion with a 66/100 majority. They also control the Republic's finances. So essentially, to get anything done, you need to go through the Senate. 

Other important positions are the Censors, the Praetors, the Proconsuls and the Aediles. 

* Praetors are the Consuls personal assistants. They are appointed by the consuls are presumably the position many Romans serve in before becoming Consul. There are 8 of them.

* Censors are the main bureaucrats of the Republic, with 10 appointed per region, these men collect taxes every year, and conduct censuses once per term. They do most of their bureaucratic work in the [censor's office](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/76/Hamilton_high_school.jpg) when they are in Rome. 

* With the rise of client states, the consul appoints a proconsul to oversee these states activities. Client states are mostly autonomous, but the proconsul has the power to override any of their actions.

* The Aediles are the ones who manage the Mediterranean-Black Sea Currency. Their power is less relevant to the everyday Roman citizen, but it is an important one. The Aediles are made up of all nations who adopted the Mediterranean-Black Sea currency. There are 500, distributed between Rome, Hellenic Republic, Serbia, Illyrian Kingdom, Cyrene, Andalusia, Thurii, Illyrian Principate, and the Teutonic Kingdom. These men work in the [Western Wing of the Foreigner's Palace](http://www.albion-prints.com/ekmps/shops/albionprint/images/italy-c1750-hand-col-print.-nero-s-golden-palace-%5B2%5D-92035-p.jpg).

His orders to send missionaries from Rome directly in Carthage is what lead to the Sicilian note which sparked the war. The Republic had to tread carefully, for its states were majority Christian, and the Roman Republic itself was 35% Christian as well. 

The Consul met with the Pope, the discussions were tense, but in the end, the Consul expressed that the Pope could not operate out of the palace anymore. The Pope had no where to go, technically everyone who worked for him were ""Aragonese"" exiles. The Consul understood that he could not send them back to Iberia. Instead, the Consul offered him to be based out of the island of Ilva. The island was close enough to Rome that the Pope would not seem evicted, but also was a military hub. The Naval defenses of Rome are stationed there and a large amount of troops.

The beginnings of the Roman-Berber war started with an offer. The faltering Berber economy was something of an enigma. The Romans, who had grown rich from their extraction of silver and gold from the former Illyrians, as well as a generous loan from the Kingdom of Cyrene, were willing to offer the Sultanate a generous loan as well as an invitation to adopt the Mediterranean-Black Sea currency. 

[An Offer to the Berbers](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWorldPowers/comments/3jcetq/an_offer_for_the_berbers/)

The Sultanate ended up insulting the Romans, infuriating and damaging centuries of good will among the two nations. 

The Pope, seeing friction among the two nations, acted independently to send Christian priests and missionaries to try and convert more people on the North African coast. 

[The Persistence of the Pope](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWorldPowers/comments/3jltiw/persistence_of_the_pope/)

The Sultanate responded by doubling down on the civil unrest in the region, deploying peacekeeping troops and trying to stymie the spread of the Christian faith. The Pope responded by redoubling his efforts in the region. The Sultan, being paranoid, seemed to think this was a plot by the Roman Republic to cause unrest among the populace and break the Berber's nation apart.

[Carthaginians and Christians](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWorldPowers/comments/3jpwc5/carthaginians_and_christians/)

The Sultan, in his paranoia, sent a letter to the Lacedaemai family of Thurii. He offered to gift the island of Sicily, land governed y the Romans for nearly half a millennium, to the Thurans in return for help against Roman presence in the area. The Thurans, whose territories are interspersed throughout out Imperium Romanum, saw that this would be a horrid move. He sent the letter to the Roman Senate, who was horrified at the Sultanate.

[The Sicilian Note](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWorldPowers/comments/3js355/the_sicilian_note/)

The Roman Republic and Thuran Federation responded by raising ships and raising naval activity. The ships stationed in Sicily were on high alert. The Sultan, hearing reports of this, sent a formal declaration of war upon the Romans while sending two large fleets to attack the ports of Agrigentus and Syracuse.

[The Tipping Point](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWorldPowers/comments/3ju41p/the_tipping_point/)

Fortunately for the Romans, the communication and logistics of the Roman Republic allowed them to respond rather quickly, and a fleet was sent to defend the island soon after the Berber's declared war. 

Blood was first drawn in the battles of Syracuse and Agrigentus. These battle pitched the Roman Dromon fleet, as well as the debut of the Roman dhow fleet, against the Berber dhow fleet. While the Dromon fleet of the Romans were more adept at defending and combat near the coast, the Roman dhow fleet was easily pushed back by the Berbers. Some clever communication and tactics by the Roman Admare resulted in decisive victories in Sicily.

[The Battles of Syracuse and Agrigentus](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWorldPowers/comments/3jxczn/battles_of_syracuse_and_agrigentus/)

Rome moved to muster its legions to go and invade the region of Carthage. This would break the naval power of the Imazighen. While the legions were mustering, the Admare tested his dhow fleet in the battle of the Maltese islands. The battle was short, and the Berbers were able to destroy half of the Roman Dhow fleet. 

[The Battle of Malta](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWorldPowers/comments/3k1vgt/the_battle_of_malta/)

Not long after the battle of Malta, the Sultan abdicated his thrown. The pressure of the court and unpopular opinion turned at the man's continued bad policies. He had gotten himself into an unwinnable offensive war.

[A Lesson in Discretion](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWorldPowers/comments/3jy7sz/a_lesson_in_discretion/)

While the battle of Malta was a Roman loss, the Romans had finally been able to muster a considerable army. They sailed and invaded the province of Carthago. The Romans were quickly able to gain the support of the Ponii in the city. The Imperator Terrae split his army and marched it all over the province, capturing town and city alike. The sacking of Agadir Ighrem, the capture of Sfax, and the victory of Gasfa put the Romans in striking distance of the capital of the Sultanate.

**Sicily**

As the Muriophorio and Phortegoi arrived, the Admare Titus Heraclia Pompeius was amazed. He had put a goal of six legions, 15,000 Equites and 10,000 crossbowmen, and what was raised among the cleint states of Rome were 8 Legions, 20,000 Equites, and 15,000 Crossbowmen. 

The states had not only sent this large army, but enough supplies, weapons, and food to sustain an army for over a year. The use of pigeons, methods of preservation and the variety of the Roman diet allowed the Republic to communicate and operate this expedition with amazing efficiency. 

With the the army arriving, the Imperator of the forces met with Titus, and discussed the land invastion. The Imperator, who lead the expedition north to Saxony, was used to fighting on different terrains,

**Carthago**

It seemed the Sultanate did not have enough time to prepare an effective defense of Carthage, as they only had two Abaghal and ten Sambuks to face the seemingly countless Roman Dromon, Dhows, and transport Muriophorio and Phortegio ships. 

The fleet fled without a fight. They knew that they would not even delay the enormous force. In Carthage, the Berber army awaited the Romans. The Dromon and Galley fleet started lobbing rocks and ballistae bolts to weaken the city's considerable defenses, but it wasnt until a few of the larger ships used their Harpax to pull the chains away and tear the walls of the harbor down. And the marines poured into the city. The Berber armies were well equipped to deal with the shock troops of the Romans, but the marines persisted. 

The Berbers seemed to be gaining the upper hand when 5 Muriophorio landed to deploy one of the eight Roman Legions. And this is when disaster struck. The Carthaginians rose up seeing the inevitable defeat of their oppressors. Nearly every Berber in Carthage was slaughtered or captured. Word reached the Sultan in Wa-Iharan of the fall of Carthage. 

Meanwhile, with the defeat of the Berber forces, the Romans were able to deploy the rest of their forces. The marines did their job as shock troops and went back to manning the Roman Navy. The Admare's role was finished, the Romans gained a beachhead and now his mission was to keep the supply lines into Africa clear.

**The Imperator's Campaign in Africa**

One Legion occupied Carthage. The rest of the Legions deployed in a field just East and West of Carthage. Four of the Legions, 10,000 Equites, and 7,500 Crossbowmen marched South making way to the city of Sfax. The army was a harassed, but the friendly Carthaginians lent them aid and supplies. The major battle happened outside of Sfax which resulted in the capture of the city.

The other three legions, 10,000 Equites, and 7,500 Crossbowmen made straight for Gafsa. They met a large Berber army. 

**The Battle of Sfax**

The Roman army marching to Sfax consisted of 41,500 Legionnaires, Hoplites, Crossbowmen and Heavy Cavalry. They met a paltry army of 15,000 defending the city. The army, hopelessly outnumbered, tried to use their cavalry to harass the hulking Roman army but was unsuccessful. The Legions pushed against them and they routed. The leader of the city of Sfax, not willing to put his men through a siege, surrendered and the city was taken with little issue. Leaving one Legion in Sfax, the rest of the army marched West to Gafsa.

**The Great Battle of Gafsa and the Breaking of the Sultanate**

The march was long and hot. But the Romans made camp outside the city of Gafsa where they faced an army of over 30,000 men to the Roman army's 36,500 combined force. 

The Romans faced a more mobile Berber force which challenged the tactical flexibility of the Roman army. When the armies clashed, it was a series of short clashes, intermixed with the Berber Tuaregs using their famous shots to cut down the Roman lines. Unfortunately, the Kharaangar horses that the Romans deployed were well equipped to deal with the camel threat. Although the heavily armored riders were at a disadvantage, most of the Equites were able to run down the Tuaregs and slaughter them. 

The battle was held at a standstill until the Imperator got a message via pigeon. The Roman army had been victorious at Sfax, and was heading to their position. Announcing this, the Romans were energized. The trumpets sounded, the drums beat, and the Romans cut down the Berber force with their lust for blood. 24,000 Berbers retreated into Gafsa, and wished to force the Romans into a protracted siege. 

With the Romans able to block any communication from Sfax and the Western cities of the Sultanate, the second Roman army was able to divert its course when they were informed that the Romans had besieged the city. The Roman army from Sfax went and sacked the city of Agadir Ighrem, which barely had anytime to raise a defense before the Roman Cavalry stormed and looted the city. The Romans carried off supplies and loot and aided in besieging Gafsa. The siege lasted for a month, with the Romans barraging the city with Onagers and Ballistae. And intercepting any messengers from the city. 

After 33 days of siege, the city of Gafsa fell to the Romans. The Governor of the city was instructed to bow before the Roman Imperator before he was cut down in front of the Sultanate's starving forces. The prisoners of war were forced to march back up to Carthage, where they would be sold as slaves. 

**Aftermath**

The morale of the Romans was high, they had not lost on Imazighen ground and had unprecedented success in besieging cities. 

The Imperator soon moved to raise additional levies in Carthage and the surrounding towns to reinforce and amplify his armies strength. The invincibility of the Sultanate was no broken. The once respected army was shamed and crushed in the battlefield, and never again would the Imazighen threaten Rome. 


But the mission was not finished. The Imperator knew the Sultan would retaliate. He knew the Sultan would launch a counteroffensive, so he made a daring attempt to besiege and capture the capital. 

It would be a month, but the Romans would soon march on Wa-Iharan. ",HistoricalWorldPowers,The Crushing of the Imazighen,https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWorldPowers/comments/3k67ey/the_crushing_of_the_imazighen/

The Romans sent pigeon messengers to both the Kingdom of Illyria, the Hellenic Republic, and the Serbian Principate. Those nations quickly worked on raising legions. Rome itself called back its veterans to man the Roman Navy.

Two Abaghal-class dhows, two dozen Sambuk-class dhows, and thirty liburnian ships transporting additional marines sailed toward Agrigentus, intent on beating back the opposition and storming the western island quickly, and a fleet half this size departed for Syracuse.

The Romans countered by sending a fleet from Rome down to Thurii to defend the straights consisting of 1 octere, 2 Hexaremes, 15 Heavy Dromon, 25 escort Dromon, and 30 normal Dromon. 25 Scout Dromon were deployed across Sicily where they quickly came across the large Berber fleet bearing down on Syracuse. 

**The Battle of Syracuse**

The Berber fleet, consisting of 15 light Liburna ships, 12 Sambuck Dhows, and 1 Baghlah approached the harbor. With the Sambucks and Liburna leading the way, they engaged the 4 Normal Dromon and Heavy Dromon defending the harbor. The fleet was able to delay them enough to get the harbor chain up. The large chain blocked the ships, and forced them up the island.

Back in Thurii, the Admare, Titus Heraclia Pompeius and his Galley fleet made for Syracuse. The Admare met the Berber Admiral just off the coast of Eastern Sicily. He configured it to have his swifter Light Dromon further out to sea lead by the Octere. These ships were meant to keep the Baghlah and Sambuks close to the coast, where the Roman ships had the advantage. 

The tactic worked, as the Baghlah fought with the Octere, it was clear the ballistae bolts from the Berber ships did little more than scratch the large Octere. The Octere was able to grab two Sambuks with harpax and pull them close, overwhelming and capturing them.

Hopelessly outnumbered, the Berber commander ordered his fleet to retreat, but not until they suffered catastrophic casualties. The lighter, but less durable Liburna were torn apart and crushed by the more advanced Dromon. The rest of the Berber fleet, the Baghlah, 10 Sambuks, and 7 Liburna flet to Malta, where they could reinforce themselves and send word to the Sultan of their defeat.

Titus soon got word that Agrigentus was under attack, he rearmed his fleet, which only suffered minimal damage, and set off for Agrigentus. 



**The Battle of Agrigentus**

The port of Agrigentus was not of huge importance, so it was not armed with a chain. The Large Berber fleet was able gain a landing and invade the city itself. Roman conscript militia, lightly armed fought the marines, and when word of Rome's dhow fleet arriving reached them, they rejoiced.

The Roman fleet, very new and inexperienced, consisted of 30 Sambuks, 20 ghanja dhows, and 10 Baghlah dhows(much smaller than the Berber ones). They faced off against 2 Baghlah dhows, 24 Sambuks, and 30 Liburna. The more experienced Berber fleet was able to outmaneuver and sink many of the Roman ships, including two Baghlahs and 4 Sambuks. The Roman fleet was forced to regroup.

Titus' fleet made its way across Sicily. he saw the fires burning in the distance and was forced to make for land for the night.

The fighting on the sea was much to the Berber's advantage, the more experienced and veteran sailors of the Sultanate overwhelmed the Romans. Still, the Romans did not give up. They managed to sink 4 Liburna, and 4 Sambuks of the Sultanate's and the Berbers sunk 5 Baghlah ships, 10 Sambuks, and 3 ghanja dhows. 

Titus sent a pigeon in the night, instructing the Roman commander to fall back, and send a portion of the dhow go out into the sea in the night, and block the way back to the Sultanate. 

Titus landed 500 Legionnaire marines to relieve Agrigentus and provide aid. 

When rosy red fingered dawn came, Titus sounded the trumpets. And the Roman fleet moved to engage the Sultanate's. The commander was not expecting the Roman fleet and one of the Baghlahs and 5 Sambuks were grabbed by the harpax heavy Roman ships. The Normal Dromon of the Romans sunk many Liburna, and the commander of the Sultanate ordered a retreat because of the sheer numbers and power of the Romans.

As they fled West, they ran into the remains of the dhow fleet, who were able to do more damage, going South, they encountered a large detachment of the Roman fleet on the open water. 

Trapped, and nowhere to go, the Berbers panicked. The command ship and 14 Sambuks were able to escape to Africa. 

And the battles of Syracuse were finished. But the Admare was not finished. He sent word to Rome, the Romans needed to act and assault Malta as soon as possible. For too long the Berbers had a significant stronghold so close to Roman lands. 

The Romans prepared quickly, rebuilding their Dhow fleet. the new dhow fleet had 25 Sambuk dhows, 7 Baghlah dhows, and 18 Ghanja dhows. They loaded up three Muriophorio with Roman Legionnaires to storm the islands.

Overall, the Romans had won a decisively and pushed the Berbers from Sicily.

These ships allowed for greater flexibility and tactics in battle. Galleys were long restricted to coastal regions. The amount of rowers and marines required to man these ships played a huge toll on manpower. 

While Galleys are great for exhibiting shock combat as well as support for ground armies, the manpower required to operate these ships was a huge disadvantage. When engaging an enemy on the open sea, whether it is defending or clearing sea lanes for cargo, it is better to be able to have as much flexibility as possible. 

The Roman Dhows had a limited role in combat situations, mostly for reconnaissance and supplies. But over the past century or so, the Romans have been collaborating with the former King of West Maghreb, now called Adalusia to completely revamp the Roman Navy.

Dromon and large Galleys will still play a huge part of projecting Roman power, but the pressing need to keep up with the Sultanate and the Republic of Lebanon on the waters was real. 

Using their knowledge of ship mounted artillery batteries, the Romans were able to convert many of the open water ships originally meant to be merchant ships into effective warships. While boarding was not a part of the strategy of these new ships, ballistae and ongagers could be used to great effect at a distance.

Grain Ships, which had been sent to deliver food to the large metropolises Athens and Rome, had been absent. Strict rations and drastic actions had to be put into place. The Romans had a very stern deal with the the Uburzians.

So they sent up a diplomatic party, with a Praetor accompanying them. Five Phortegoi and Three dhows sailed through the Hellespont and the Bosporus. Seeing the standard of the Republic, the guards of the Knights of Jupiter simply waved them through. 

In the dialogue with the Hegemon of Uburzia, Dorotheus, stated that the Knights of Jupiter had been blocking the Hellespont and Bosporus. The Praetor knew that this was false, for when the Knights saw the flag of the Republic, they simply waved them through, and any ship carrying grain would bear the flag of the Republic. 

In the talks with the Hegemon, Rome was able to receive a generous amount of grain and fish, enough for Athens and Rome for three times over, and slaves. 

The Praetor's suspicions were confirmed when the Knights waved the Phortegoi fleet passed the Bosporus on the way back. 

The Praetor then gained an audience with Grandmaster Diogenes of the Knights of Jupiter. It was here where he talked the issue over with him. Diogenes admitted to arresting Uburzian diplomats and stopping Uburzian ships, but he was adamant in saying ships bearing Rome's standard were not stopped. 

When the Praetor returned to Rome, he reported his findings. The Consul at the time decided to craft two letters. One to the Grandmaster of the Knights, and another to the Hegemon of Uburzia. 

To Grandmaster Diogenes:

*Greetings Grandmaster Diogenes,*

*The first thing I would like to say is that the Roman Republic respects the Black Sea as your sphere of influence. The Romans in no way are disputing or challenging that.*

*It has come to my attention that tensions between the Knights of Jupiter and the Hegemony of Uburzia have come to start to effect the citizenry in Athens, in the Hellenic Republic, and more importantly Rome. Whether you are to blame or not, the grain must flow from Uburzia.*

*So I say this to you, if military action, or blockades must happen, the grain ships must still come to Rome or we will hold you responsible. 1 Uburzian diplomat per convoy must be permitted to pass on the way to Rome. We cannot be left in the dark about these matters. Citizens, Greeks, and Romans lives depend on these shipments*

*All the Best,*

*Gnaeus Catullus, Consul of Rome*


To Dorotheus the Hegemon of Uburzia:

*Greetings Dorotheus the Hegemon of Uburzia*

*I wish I could write to you under better circumstances, and write more positive things, but recent events have forced Rome's hand. The tales that the Praetor of Rome presented to us has not lined up and has not been consistent. It makes many Senators and Tribunes think that you purposely withheld grain from us to provoke a reaction. Perhaps there is truth to both sides of your story, perhaps tough harvest have hindered you from sending grain. The fact is, you are responsible for letting the Roman Republic know of the situation before we pay for the grain. We pay in 3 month installments up front and expect to get the grain in full. Alas, here is the statement crafted for me from the Senate. They compelled me to send it.*

*The next time you withhold grain from us, we will sail there with the might of the Roman Navy, and take the grain we have paid for by force.*

*From,*

The Imperator had brought with him 9,000 men, consisting of 1 Legion and 5 Equitati divisions.

The Legion consists of 5,120 Legionnaires and 880 Hoplites, the 5 Equitati adds up to 3,000 heavy cavalry.

This brings the force in the Kingdom von der Tiefallemannisch to 26,500 men with a diverse mix of heavy and light infantry, as well as cavalry. 

Imperator Titus set the lines like this. The 100 Teutonic Light cavalry would go out as scouts in teams of five to survey the land. The target was the city of Irminsul. The army would be configured in this way. The Jaerl and his 7,000 men would march with 4,400 men in the front, commanded by King Gero of the Tuetons. Next would come the Roman forces. The Hoplites would protect the outside of the convoy from cavalry charges. Next came King Liutpold's forces. King Lief's army would guard the rear of the army. 

When the city of Irminsul was within sight, the army made camp. Titus assigned one cohort to construct 5 Ballistae and 5 Onagers.

As the Romans slowly, but peacefully annex the territories in the Balkans, the wealth of the Romans start to skyrocket. 

Trade has picked up as the Sultanate of the Imazighen has taken power. The Roman bloc prospered like never before as the Republic's treasury swelled from taxes in the Balkans, and tariffs and tolls on the various canals and straits in the Mediterranean. 

The common currency was adopted by Cyrene, the Hellenic Republic, the Thuran Federation, Serbia, Uburzia and Las Grand Balears, making commerce and trade between these nations easier then ever before.

The worries of Lebanese troops at the Corinthian Canal subsided, as the soldiers often used local markets, mingled with Roman and Greek soldiers and often became friends. What was thought would be a strained relationship only resulted in bringing the Roman Republic and the Republic of Lebanon closer. The Knights of Jupiter continue to be a respected martial order that defends and Hellenizes peoples of the Balkans. 

Unprecedented influence in the nations of the Kingdom of West Mahgreb, Las Grand Balears and Serbia had many of the common people talking about *Imperium Romanum*, or Roman Power.

Rome had friends north too, the Teutonic Kingdom and the Kingdom of Saxony were close friends of Rome. 

Foreign relations with the Imazighen, Gulgea, Francia and Iberia remained wary but cordial.

There was a catch. The Pompeian family dominated the military and the politics. Ever since *Dictator Perpetuo* Pompeius Saevus had reorganized Rome into a Republic, his descendants have consistently dominated the Republic, being appointed proconsuls, consuls, praetors, Imperators, and Admares. 

The Pompeian family has also vast land holdings. They own land in Rome, Aldermus, Sicily, Hellas, and now they are carving out estates in Illyria. This domination of one family has made other senators and officials uneasy. The worst part is the line of Pompeius Saevus is endorsed by a powerful family in Thurii, the Heraclias. This makes them powerful not only in Roman controlled lands, but Thuran lands as well. 

While other powerful families existed in Rome, like the Claudians, Julians, Catonians, Cincinnatans, they all paled in comparison to the Pompeians.

Soon the two nations stabilized, but the picture was very different now. 

The Knights of Jupiter have been able to march into their lands and annex them without much resistance. The two nations knew that this had to change. The two nations came together to push back the Knights of Jupiter.

Forming an army of Kharaangar Cavalry, spearmen, swordsmen, and bowmen, the Moesians and Dacians marched south. 

Without the military prowess of Pannonia behind them, the two Kingdoms had to work together to push the Knights back to Thrace. Their objectives were to sack the great city of Thessalonika and crush the Knights of Jupiter's hegemony in the region.

The Pannonians did the same. The march was steady, many men died, or were knocked out of rank, but the determination of the Romans was absolute. 

The Romans fought bravely, the Equites fought bravely, but the former glory of the Illyrian Empire was clearly the superior force. Julius could see his soldiers being pushed back. He knew that he had moments to react. He, with his Equitati unit, rallied the other Equites not engaging the Pannonian cavalry. He removed and reorganized Cohorts from the center to the flanks, he further reinforced the flanks with hoplites armed with sarissa to keep the Pannonian horses at bay. He then struck, going around the battle line south, he lead his 2,000 Equites into the southern flank of the enemy. The Equites started by throwing pila into the mass of Pannonian infantry. Simultaneously, he had the center of the Roman battle line withdraw slightly. When Julius' horses expended their javelins, they charged and smashed into the Pannonian battle lines. Once at close quarters, they took out their maces and crushed Pannonian men. 

With the center of the battle line falling back, the now strengthened flanks pushed forward. With the long Sarissa pikes, the Romans were able to keep the Pannonian cavalry away while keeping the infantry in front of them at bay. 

The Romans were slowly able to encircle the Pannonians and the rout was on. Thousands of Pannonians were killed and captured in battle. 

The Romans sustained casualties, over 8,000 Legionnaires,3,00 Equites, and 2,000 Crossbowmen perished in the fighting. The Pannonians fared worse, over 20,000 of their army was killed, with another 8,000 taken prisoner. The Romans licked their wounds, and marched forward, hoping to break the Pannonians once and for all. 

The Pannonians, although beaten, did not lose their spirit and rose and army in the Budapesti area to confront the Roman army.

He approached the Lebanese commander and was talking about the Kharaangar horses and their effectiveness. The Lebanese man seemed to have little interest until he saw the Harpax that most Roman ships are equipped with.

Julius marched South through Serbia.

Julius marched South with 14,000 Legionnaires, and 2,100 Hoplites, 2,700 Crossbowmen, and 3,400 Equites. In Serbia, the Arms of Preun joined with 4,725 spearmen.

Just south of Serbia, Publius had an army of 15,000 Legionniares, 1,500 Hoplites, 1,500 Crossbowmen, and 4,000 Equites.

Julius would assault the large Pannonian army from the rear and join forces with Publius. 

And it happened that way. The Romans surprised the Pannonians, and they retreated East where Publius was able to attack the fleeing army and crush them. The South of Pannonia was put under Roman control.  The armies made camps and fortified the camps.

With the relative success of Julius Heraclia Pompeius, the Roman Republic was pleased. Julius figured he would move to consolidate his armies further into Pannonia.

He called up an addition 4,000 Illyrian Spearman to reinforce his own army and used the far northern army to defend his rear. He would march and finish off the Pannonians he had fought before, then march South to support the other Romans, who were having a significantly harder time.

His cousin and assistant, who was managing the southern campaign, Publius Pompeius, called up 6,000 more Illyrians, 2,500 more bowment and 3,500 Spearmen. He too would march his northern army forward and try to force a pitched battle. With the extra manpower and Legion, he figured he could defeat the Pannonians decisively. 

[Map of supposed plans](http://i.imgur.com/azGCyJK.jpg)

In the North, Julius fought the Pannonians again and routed them, then turned his attention south. His scouts reported a large Pannonian army just East of Serbia. So he made for them. 

The Pannonians surprised him, by marching out to attack his force, and Julius was able to order a well timed cavalry charge to push the Pannonians back. He was victorious, but one of his legions was decimated, so he was forced to make camp and fortify his position. 

Simultaneously, in the South, the northern army of Publius was attacked by two large Pannonian armies by surprise. The army was outnumbered by over 20,000 Pannonians and destroyed. 


[Map](http://i.imgur.com/LtiSd16.jpg)

The larger army that Publius was leading, marched further into Pannonian territory, but with the news of the defeat of his support force, he found himself surrounded by four Pannonian armies.

When Julius heard of the defeat down south, and the situation, he was shocked and despondent. He found himself surrounded by three armies.

Julius sent envoys to Serbia, asking for passage and soldiers through their lands so he could support his cousin. At this point, the campaigns are not going as he thought they would go.

Using the six Legion stationed in Illyria, Julius Heraclia Pompeius reinforced them with 12,000 cavalry, or 20 Equitati. 

The Illyrians provided the bowmen, using the deadly Kharaangar bows. For each Legion, the Illyrians supplied 3,000 bowmen to support the campaigns.

Julius would invade and conduct long brutal campaigns and conduct warfare against the powerful kingdom of Pannonia.

He knew it would be a tough war, so he set up supply lines and had the Illyrians raise more levies of spearmen to protect the baggage trains. 

The army would be split into six parts. Each with a Legion, 2,000 Horsemen, and 3,000 Illyrian bowmen. 

In the North, 1 Legion, 2,000 Horsemen, and 3,000 bowmen will march north toward Poland and march north of the Lake.

The other two Legions, 4,000 Horsemen and 6,000 Bowmen will march into the teeth of the Kingdom of Pannonia, just North of Serbia. 

In the south, two legions, 4,000 horsemen, and 6,000 bowmen will push into Pannonia while another army (1 legion, 2,000 horsemen, and 3,000 bowmen) will march just south of Serbia. This two armies will attract a large Pannonia force, and the 3rd army will try to flank and crush the Pannonians.

Julius Pompeius will oversee the Northern Campaign so as to defend Republican lands.

[Map of Campaigns](http://i.imgur.com/TC6Cr2s.jpg)

The Pannonians reacted swiftly in the North, with a hardened army that had just crushed a rebellion, they set up the battle lines just north of the lake south of Poland. 

The Romans saw this and started to form up. The Hoplites defended the flanks and the Cavalry were in reserve. 

The infantry of the Pannonians marched toward the Romans and they met in battle. Pila flew, bows flew. The Kharaangar Cavalry were kept at bay by the steady Hoplites and the Legionnaires fought to a stale mate. The fighting was brutal.


The Roman Cavalry looped around the Northern flank of the battle lines where they drove back the Horse archers of the Pannonians. The chase was on. The battle seemed to be going the Romans way until the 15,000 Horsemen that the Polish refused to fight arrived and flanked and crushed the Roman Army. 

The Romans retreated, sustaining heavy losses.

The Legion suffered the worst of it, losing over 1500 of their men including 800 Hoplites. They regrouped just west of the Lake and made fortifications to defend the rear of the other army marching south of the Lake.

The larger Roman army, commanded by Julius, met an exhausted Pannonian army which had fought in both the Rebellion of the Budapesti and the Serbian Rebellion. The Pannonians were routed, and the Roman army was able to march forward deeper into Pannonian territory. 

In the South, the larger Roman army engaged a huge Pannonian army quite quickly. Quicker than expected. The heavy cavalry of the Pannonians were able to strike the Legions before they could get formed up. The battle was fierce and many died on each side. The Romans were able to hold them off, but made no additional progress into Pannonian land.

The northern army went unnoticed. When they heard that the Romans were *somewhat* victorious, they opted not to support the army and instead conduct their own campaigns. They figured that the bulk of the Pannonian army was south of them. 

The Romans had won a single decisive victory, a crushing defeat, a stalemate, an army that didn't engage in battle. 

The difficulty of these campaigns highlighted the difference in cavalry and experience that these fresh Legions lacked. Most of the Pannonian armies were less numerous than the Romans. Although they both fought with ferocity, the Pannonians held their own and shocked the Roman army. 

Julius knew that this progress would be short-lived if he did not revise his tactics. The Pannonians would surely rally and mount a counter offensive. The Serbians were just recovering from their rebellion and the Polish were sent back to Poland with their tail between their legs. 

The Imperator was stuck. He prayed to the gods to give his armies strength as they made fortifications and prepared for the worst.

The former Empire, reverted to a small kingdom on the coast of the Adriatic. The rest of the Empire dissolved into three other independent kingdoms. Dacia to the East, Moesia just West of Dacia, and Pannonia. 

The Kingdom of Pannonia was by far the most powerful of the kingdoms, inheriting most of the army, including the cavalry. They pushed West to Illyria, putting the Kingdom on the brink of destruction. 

The former great emperor Dacous, now a small king, appealed to the Republic for help. In return for being a cleint, the Romans agreed to reinforce and aid the Kingdom of Illyria. The Legions got into position, when the Prince of Poland, Lech II crossed paths with the Imperator of the Roman army, Julius Pompeius. 

The two met and agreed to a rough plan to make the situation as profitable for both of them. This is when the Teutonic Kingdom raided the Moesians and Dacians. The Teutons deliberately avoided Poland to raid these kingdoms. This drew the wrath of the Pannonians. The Pannonians, who were preparing for another invasion of Illyria, were asked to aid the Moesians and Dacians to go north.

The three kingdoms put together a coalition of cavalry 15,000 strong and rode north, raiding and pillaging through the kingdom of Poland. In the Tuetonic Kingdom, they raided their towns. The brave Tuetons mounted a defense, but the inexperienced armies were no match for the heavy cavalry of the former Illyrian Empire. The coalition routed multiple armies and were in sight of Berlin and Danzig before they felt the message was sent. 

Meanwhile, the enraged King of Poland rose 40,000 men to await the 15,000 raiders return to cut them off. The Cavalry now approach Poland with an offer. Fight them just East of Poland or not at all.

The actions of these two young Kingdoms brought the attention of Pannonia, Dacia and Moesia North and spared the Kingdom of Illyria some time. 


Meanwhile, just north of Hellas, the Kingdom of Macedonia had reformed into a coherent military force. After facing defeats at the hands of the Knights of Jupiter and the Romans, they went through a period of isolation. Now they are looking to get back into the political game. They send envoys North, to Pannonia and Moesia, to see if they could gain the aid of these two kingdoms in their aspirations for revenge.

When a new Emperor was crowned, Emperor Dacous of The Illyrian Empire, the other governors and government official simply refused to acknowledge him as a legitimate ruler.

These rogue nations were powerful kingdoms that gained the loyalty of their soldiers. All of them were hostile to each other and waged almost constant warfare on each other.

The Republic acted pragmatically, closing their northern frontiers, closing all ports in Sardinia, Corsica, and Sicily, and closing off Rome itself from Berber and Gulgean traders. 

While Roman officials and clerics took a prudent stance, Pope Urban jumped right into the fire. He smuggled priests in Sicily to take care of the sick and afflicted, sent priests north to care for the sick Romans. Where Roman pagans turned away Gulgean Faryaban refugees, the Christian households accepted them.

The Pope organized a forging of Lebanese banners and sent them to Cyrene to care for the sick there. 

All faiths were taken care of. He even went himself, with his entourage, to the Roman-Gulgean border to ask to go into the Amirate to care for the sick. He sent more priests to the Imazighen to request that they be permitted to care for the sick. Where the Christians could have shunned the Faryaba, they instead offered a kind and helping hand. 

Christians went without fear to face the plague, to hostile territory. For this is what Jesus would have done. He walked among the sick, the disabled, the curse, and the possessed. The Christians were doing their duty.

This embarrassed the Roman Republic and in a shocking precedent, Pope Urban spoke in front of the Consuls, the Senate and Tribunal Council, the entire Roman government. He preached the philosophy of Jesus the Savior and begged for help with supplying and shipping donations.

At 19, he was selected to manage the Roman fleet in Thurii, being the youngest Roman to be given this position. After his uncle won the consulship in 705 CE, he was made a Censor of Rome at age 21. 

He would return to Thurii once more in 710-715 where he met and married the first daughter of the Heraclia family in Thurii. In his two terms in Thurii, Marcus showed talent as a military commander on the land and the sea. He always hated it though. He preferred to resolve things diplomatically. 

After getting back from Thurii he won the Praetorship for the 715-720 term where he was sent on diplomatic missions around the Mediterranean. He had a talent for convincing locals to bend to Roman will diplomatically. Marcus also welcomed and negotiated with Pope Gregory when he fled the Kingdom of Aragon. During the 720-725 elections, Marcus Pompeius lost the consulship and was appointed Censor. This was a blow to his self esteem at the age of 37.

Soon though, the Roman Republic called upon his services as a military commander. In 723 CE, the Theban League invaded Roman territory in Hellas. The Republic appointed Marcus Heraclia Pompieus Imperator of the Roman forces in Hellas. The long bloody war, which saw the tide go back and forth ended with the destruction of the Theban League. For the next 20 years, Marcus spent time in Hellas conducting campaigns and negotiating with the weak and disunited Kingdom of Thessaly. 

In 750 CE, Marcus ordered a full scale invasion and Rome annexed what remained of the southern Greeks. Coming back to Rome, he was hailed as a war hero, he won the consulship easily in 750 CE and went to work with consolidating Roman power in Hellas and Italia. He drafted and organized the Hellenic Republic, an autonomous client state of Rome. He then drafted and negotiated with Thurii the Union of Hellas-Roma, further consolidating power.

Marcus Heraclia Pompeius, who had orchestrated the destruction of the powerful Theban League,  pushed back the Aegean Empire,  won the consulship in 750 CE, without even being in Rome. His popularity among the upper and lower classes across the Roman Republic only grew with his administration and the image of him being truly ""Roman.""

*****

Marcus' first act of being consul was to come to a solid resolution concerning Hellas. The first issue was whether procedure dictated that Hellas was a domestic or foreign issue. Marcus was the consul of foreign affairs.

After cooperating with the domestic consul, Marcus presented some solutions to the issue. 

One suggestion was to grant all land owning Hellenes citizenship, but the issue of expanding the senate, tribunal council and logistics with voting made that prohibitive. Another suggestion was to turn Hellas into a client Republic. The Greeks would rule themselves internally but answer to Rome. Other Romans suggested simply reverting it back to a kingdom, but the majority of Romans were finished with kings. 

Marcus set up a committee,  with the Thuran representative on the tribunal council to come to a resolution. Discussions got heated.

Marcus invited the Pope to sit in on the meeting and give counsel, many Hellenes  had become Catholics, so the pope's opinion on the matter was important to Marcus.

After four weeks of intense discussion, it was decided that Rome would organize Hellas into a Republic with its own tribunal council and senate. The Senate of Rome would appoint a proconsul to manage the territory, and he would be given power to override anything the Hellenic Republic passed. Rome made Athens the capital of the new Hellenic Republic, seeing it's central location and access to the Eastern Mediterranean. 

Another resolution Marcus came to was to resettled 50,000 legionnaire veterans, 10,000 crossbowmen veterans and their families in Hellas. 

Marcus would appoint his two sons, Julius Heraclia Pompeius and Gnaeus Heraclia Pompeius to take over Roman campaigning in Hellas. 

A wealthy Venetian was appointed as proconsul of Hellas, Claudius Maximus, and he set to organizing the cities of Hellas into a functioning Republic.

The last thing Marcus passed in 750 CE was a formal treaty to be presented to the nation of Thurii. The treaty, if accepted would unite the Roman Republic, Thurii, and the new Hellenic Republic into a union named Hellas-Roma.

Churches were set up, and Bishops were appointed. The Pope, now being a very old man, soon died. And the process to elect a new Pope began. The newly elected Pope took the name John.

Pope John looks to hear back from Lebanon about setting up missions in Egypt, Anatolia and the Levant, the Knights of Jupiter in Thrace, and Cyrene about setting up missions in North Africa.

King Alexander of Macedon conquered much of the territory he lost. The vassal state of Epirus gained some territory. The small state of Acarnania rose. The king of the Peloponnese, Lysander, died of old age, and the last vestige of the Kingdom of Hellas was absorbed into Thurii.

The Republic, using Marcus Heraclia Pompeius as Imperator, ordered the armies under Roman control to raid and campaign in Thessaly. The campaigns were resisted, but they brought Thessaly to its knees.

At 41 years old, Marcus Heraclia Pompieus had just been given permission to strike at the Theban League with the might of Rome. It was a uncomfortable fact. He came to Hellas two years prior expecting to just govern the region. 

Once the plans were set he marched north to break the siege at Athens with nearly 30,000 men. He was nervous. Although he had commanded men into battle before...it was never quite to this scale. The Admare, one of his cousins, who was far more experienced, seemed almost eager to get into it. Marcus, was more cautious.

****

**Megara**

Marcus' army met the Theban one earlier than expected. The formations had to be drawn up hastily and the battle commenced. Amidst the chaos, Marcus lead a Hoplite squadron to the right flank of the Thebans.

After the battle, with the Roman victorious, Marcus looked around. He saw thousands of broken and bloody bodies. He hastily moved past them. When one of the centurions asked him what to do with the 500 prisoners, Marcus responded that they should be sent to Corinth...not contemplating what usual procedure was. 

He walked with his bodyguards through the sacked city of Megara, the fires burning and the civilians hurt, dirty and scared. The hungry were crying out for food. His army marched on to Athens, where the populace was starving. Marcus urgently sent word to Corinth to set up a supply route to relieve these cities. 

**The Siege of Thebes**

As Marcus set up camp outside of Thebes, he found himself exhausted everyday. He was miserable, but he still pressed on. When the walls of Thebes came tumbling down, he saw the suffering his forces had inflicted on the populace there and was despondent. He pursued the fleeing Thebans in great haste, putting as much distance between him and the city of Thebes as quickly as possible. It was only until his officers forced him to stop that he did. And he stationed a Legion at the hot gates.

The next two months were a blur. He found himself by Delphi, where he met up with Lycurgus and his men. The battered soldiers had seen defeat. Marcus made it a point to meet with all the officers before they marched off to Stratus to engage the last Theban army.

**The Battle of Stratus**

Marcus was discouraged, he knew what he would see after the battle. Whether he won or lost, he knew thousands would die and tens of thousands would suffer. He begrudgingly lead his troops into battle. He could sense the desperation from the Thebans, and he could see them fighting hard. 

He was incredulous when the Thebans started pushing the Romans back. He thought he could see the Legions breaking when the Admare's troops arrived to flank. The army routed and the Gulf of Corinth was Rome's. 

**In Rome**

Marcus was given a triumph in Rome. The destruction of the Theban League was a pretty big deal politically. He was wildly popular. Bards and poets and historians sung and wrote about him. The cheering plebs in the streets could not get enough as he was touring the city.

He came home and rested for a few days. He was receiving gifts from this family and that family, but all Marcus could think about was the broken bodies in Hellas. ",HistoricalWorldPowers,Devastation of War,http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWorldPowers/comments/3d33vp/devastation_of_war/

The Theban League put together a massive army. Over 20,000 Hoplites and 10,000 Bowmen. And marched them South to Athens. 

Marcus Heraclia Pompeius, who had been stationed in Hellas two years prior, was in Argos at a meeting. He was quickly summoned to Corinth where he would raise an army when the crisis got even worse. 7,000 Hoplites, escorted by a Theban fleet of Triremes and Quadiremes, landed in Achaea and began raiding the coast. The Hoplites laid siege to the city of Elis.

Marcus found himself with Elis and Athens under siege. In Corinth, Marcus called on the three legions stationed there, 18,000 men, and sent word to Rome. He also had 8,000 Crossbowmen at his disposal. He knew he was outnumbered and on foreign soil. He would need the Peloponnesians and Corinthians help to defeat the threat. 

In Rome, war was quickly declared. Marcus met with the Admare in Corinth to discuss plans. The plan would be for the Navy to seize control of the Gulf of Corinth to cut off the invading forces in Achaea, and push the invaders from Attica out and make for Thebes and Delphi. 

The plan was set. Marcus took his three Legions and 8,000 Crossbowmen and marched to Athens to break the siege and do battle. The Admare, his cousin, sailed around with a fleet of 20 Normal, 10 Heavy, and 15 Light Dromon, one Octere, and 3 Hexaremes with a full complement of scouts. A Greek general, Lycurgus, under Marcus' instructions rose 6,000 Hoplites and 500 bowmen of the Peloponnese to break the siege of Elis. 

The first of these engagements was at the mouth of the Gulf of Corinth, near the islands of Cephallenia, Ithaca, and Leucas. Many Hellenic ships engaged the Dromon coming from the Gulf and from the islands, attacking them from both directions. The seasoned fleet of the Romans were easily able to outmaneuver and defeat the Triremes and Quadiremes. Losses were minimal, only 2 light Dromon were lost while 10 Triremes and 12 Quadiremes were sunk. The heavier ships, with more men, set to seizing control of the islands. The remaining Dromon, lead by one Hexareme, would go into the Gulf of Corinth to combat the Theban fleet there. 

*****

The Peloponnesians faced difficulty in Achaea, they were outnumbered and the Thebans were seasoned warriors on the ground. They were pushed back multiple times. The Thebans and Delphians fought with utmost confidence, knowing they had reinforcements and control of the Gulf at their back. Lycurgus, who was a very competent general was able to retreat back to Sicyon with most of his force intact. 


*** 

Marcus marched to break the siege at Athens. His 18,000 Legionnaires and hoplites, with 8,000 Crossbowmen marched across the Isthmus to Megara. There they saw that the Thebans had received word of the Roman force and marched out to meet them.

The Theban force, with 30,000 men, and the Roman force, with 28,000 men, faced off outside of Megara. The Hoplites of the Greeks marched forward toward the Legionnaires, their tough shields effectively defending them from the Crossbowmen. The Legionnaires then let their Pila fly. Thousands of the javelins flew through the air and struck the hoplites shield. The heavy javelin bent, rendering a lot of the shields useless. The Legionnaires then went to work, pushing the Thebans back. The right flank of the Thebans were strong and stacked, they pushed the Romans back and were about to flank the Legionnaire block when the Roman Hoplites came and pushed them back. The army of Thebes broke and ran. The army retreated to Thebes. Casualties were heavy, with over 7,000 Thebans dying and 4,000 Romans dying, the two forces rested for a week. Then Rome went to march on Thebes. Marcus commissioned the building of 10 onagers and 10 Ballista, and assigned a cohort to manage them. 

The discouraged Thebans saw the Romans approaching and holed up behind the tall walls of Thebes.

****

In the Gulf of Corinth, the Roman Dromon were locked in battle. Although the Roman ships and sailors were superior, the sheer numbers of the Theban ships were holding them back. Reinforcements arrived, the Octere, two Hexaremes, and 10 Heavy Dromon arrived. The ships dropped off 70% of their marines in Achaea and now, being lighter were able to sink ship after ship, defeating the Theban Navy and pushing it to the Isthmus. The fleeing Theban Navy was pursued by the Romans.

The Thebans had blockaded Corinth, which had a small naval force protecting it, but now the retreating Theban navy crashed into the blockading force. Thousands of Thebans were killed and captured.

****

With control of the Gulf of Corinth, the Thebans in Achaea were cut off from supplies and reinforcements. Lycurgus was able to muster his forces and attack their army again. It seemed like he would lose, but the marines from the Roman navy came down and saved the day. Thousands more were killed and captured.

The day was not done yet, the Admare organized a massive invasion of Aetolia to deal a finished blow to the Theban League.

He would ferry Lycurgus' forces and they, with his marines, would lay siege to Delphi.

****

Marcus had broken through the walls at Thebes, and that is when the leaders of the Theban Legue fled. The Romans were in hot pursuit, capturing towns on the way until the exhausted Romans stopped at Thermopylae.

****

Lycurgus' army with Roman marines were able to remove the siege weapons from the Roman ships and re-purposed them to lay siege to the city. Delphi too fell quickly.  

***

Leaving one of his three Legions at Thermopylae, Marcus marched West to join up with Lycurgus. A growing Theban forces at Stratus was mobilizing to mount a counteroffensive. This army was rumored to have more than 40,000 Hellenes. Marcus simply laughed at this number. There was no way the Thebans had access to this many men. Marcus marched West, and met with Lycurgus at Delphi. There he instructed the Admare to go around to Ithaca and land his marines there. His marines would flank the last enemy army in Aetolia while his force engaged them.

The soldiers were nervous, the number 40,000 hung around there heads, but Marcus encouraged them, saying that they could defeat them anyway. The army reached Stratus later that month, where they faced an army of 23,000 Hoplites and 4,000 Bowmen.

The two sides set up to do battle and clashed outside of Stratus. The Thebans again had numbers, and desperation on their side and were able to push Marcus' army back until the Roman Marines came and flanked the Theban army. They broke and Rome was victorious.

**723 CE**

Marcus sat in his house, he was now 39 years old and a Censor. During the last twenty years, Marcus was sent on diplomatic missions, another term in Thurii, and served as Praetor. He was just barely not selected as Consul, and now had an abundance of free time. 

He decided to turn down a spot on the Senate, saying that politics was not for him. He expanded the Pompeian family's influence and wealth. His children held citizenship in Thurii and in Rome. Whatever his ancestors had built, which was considerable, Marcus doubled it. 

Marcus looked up as his wife came over, holding a message from the Senate and Consul. Later that day, he walked into the Senate Chamber. Consul Claudius stood up and read a message from the Theban League. The Thebans made it clear that they intend to exert their influence and annex the rest of Hellas. Roman control in the region was again threatened. 

Marcus then asked why he was called over to the Senate house. Claudius then said that Marcus Heraclia Pompieus would be offered the authority and responsibilities of Imperator of the Roman forces in Hellas. And if Thebes were to attack Rome, Marcus would wage war against the Thebans. And so just like that Marcus was put in control of over 20,000 Romans and as many Hellenes.

In his term serving in Thurii, Marcus grew quite a bit. He became the head of the household once again from Thurii as his father was called to Hellas again. This time on a more permanent basis. With his uncle running affairs in Rome, Marcus dedicated his life to keeping the straits clear. He crushed the pirates in northern Sicilia. The culprits were unintegrated people. The Romans had left yet the Thurans had not integrated them into their tributary system. 

A slave uprising, supported by Punic peoples was put down violently by Marcus. This was part of the job he hated. Marcus was not a violent man, nor did he presume to have a mind for strategy or tactics, and yet, here he was.

Marcus sat in on Boule and Demos meetings, and Tribunal meetings. He was surprised when Thurii took direct control of the Peloponnese. 

Marcus even spoke on behalf of the Romans many times. He also began courting the daughter of the Heraclia family. The two got along swimmingly and Marcus' father approved of the match. The most powerful family in Rome would be linked with a prominent family in Thurii.

Gifts from the Thurans were plenty, Marcus was able to amass a small fortune, on top of his family's considerable wealth. Marcus became a good speaker and orator. In Rome, people heard of the great victories he had. 

Marcus' time in Thurii ended mid 705 CE, he wished to go up to Khaldola to watch the Ligurian Games, but he was needed home. Elections were starting. This was a crucial election, as the Cincinnatan party was working to keep power against the Cult of Mars. Cincinnatus had kept Rome out of a major conflict, but he was unpopular and viewed as cowardly. 

When the results came back, the Cult of Mars took control of the Tribunal council. Marcus was despondent when they selected his uncle, Publius to be the Consul. He knew what that meant. More aggressive moves in Hellas, more Romans sent to kill and to die. He was despondent as Publius station 10 more Heavy Dromon, and another Legion in Hellas. Marcus knew the nations in Hellas would see this as a buildup for war.  

Marcus came back, and was very popular, he was selected to be a Censor of Roma. He would organize taxes and perform Censuses for the next five years. He knew this experience, as well as running his family in Rome would be invaluable to the future.

**Early 703 CE**

Marcus is 18 years old. He had managed his household to such a degree that they were profiting more than ever before. He impressed others with his business saavy mind and quick decision making. He was able to obtain more land in Sicily, Almdermus, and his father had been awarded a generous plot of land in the Peloponnese.

His father returned after being victorious. The Aegean fleet was crippled and Roman interests in the region were fulfilled. Marcus knew that the uneasy peace would not last. The current administration would be done in two years and many wealthy families had relatives killed in the fighting. They would not forget.

One day, the Consul Cincinnatus called Marcus to the Tribunal chamber to discuss something. On the next day, he arrived at the Tribunal chamber a very nervous man. Had he overlooked something? Accidentally done something illegal? Cincinnatus looked at him, with the 84 Tribunes looking on. He then offered him to manage Roman affairs in Thurii until 705 CE.

Marcus was blown away, and despondent. He knew what the job entailed. Endless accounts and calculations and dividing of tariffs. On the other hand, he would get his own estate to live in for the term, and he would have 20 ships under his command. He was given a few days to think if over.

His father, a pragmatic and proud man, encouraged him to take this route. He would know. Marcus was told that this would open the doors to political life and military life. 

Marcus was still unsure, he had a life in Rome. His friends, the tavern he frequented, the girl he saw, and the gladiator matches he loved. 

Marcus ended up taking the offer. As he sailed down the coast of Italy, he thought of the beautiful countryside he would miss. He had not been to Thurii since he was a kid, when he was being schooled. It had been five years. He had seen the port had grown quite a bit. He saw ships from Lebanon, Cyrene, and the Caliphate there. Hundreds of them being processed and escorted through the straits by Roman Dromon.

The Thurans who greeted him were kind, but serious. They spoke in the Thuran dialect of Greek, which had a Punic accent, telling him that many of the officials running the port were waiting on him for a meeting.

He walked into a large building and into a room. Six people in their late 30s were waiting for him. They murmured among themselves, nervously. Marcus knew they were commenting on how young he was. He rolled his eyes. He sat down, and spoke in Latin, asking them what the issue was. The men were silenced. It was considered very disrespectful to speak business to these men in anything but Punic Greek. But Marcus felt he needed to make a statement. The men were silent for about 10 seconds. Marcus held his ground and they outlined the issues, in Latin. They voiced their displeasure in the inhabitants of Nova Carthago since there has been a surge of pirates from that way. Pirate activity on Sicily was pretty common too. It wasn't much, but enough for the merchants in Lebanon and the Caliphate to notice. One of them outlined a plan to go and get them and bring them to justice. Another one thought that was foolish, as it is Nova Carthago's issue. Marcus soon broke in, saying that the removal of ships from the Thuran strait would leave it susceptible to raids and ships ignoring the tariff. They discussed the matter late into the afternoon before breaking off the meeting until tomorrow. 

Marcus was then escorted to the Roman estate where he would be staying. Although it was not as big as his house in Rome, it had it's own vineyard, and more importantly, lots of wine, and mead.

Marcus was invited to a welcome party at one of the major families estates. The family Heraclia had invited the young man over. When he got there, he was greeted by one of the most beautiful women he had ever seen. Marcus was astounded. 

He was lead into the main dining room where they feasted on figs, drank wine, mead, and later beer. The patriarch of the Heraclia drunkenly teased Marcus about the incident in the meeting. Word had spread of a new, confident, maybe a bit arrogant Roman in town. 

Marcus went back to his house late that night, drunk, thinking about what he would say at the meeting tomorrow, and what there was to do around Thurii.",HistoricalWorldPowers,A Day in the Life of a Roman Citizen,http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWorldPowers/comments/3cu9wg/a_day_in_the_life_of_a_roman_citizen/

With Peloponnesian reinforcements in Cythera, the Aegean Empire's soliders holding the island were forced to surrender. The harassment of the Roman Navy by the Aegean Empire's ships were soon halted as Roman ships responded by using their harpax to pull more of the ships close and capture them whenever possible. While the raids stopped at Cythera, the Admare in Athens knew he had to find and strike at the location where the rest of the main Imperial fleet was stationed. He figured the Empire's ships were either hiding near the Peloponnese, or at Melos. 

He sent a small fleet, 5 Heavy Dromon, 10 Normal Dromon, and 10 Light Dromon, with Small Dromon scouts to go and relieve the Roman fleet and Cythera. He sent another fleet, 10 Heavy Dromon, 20 Normal Dromon, 7 Light Dromon, an Octere and Hexareme, with 8,000 Hellenistic hoplites in Phortegoi to sail to Melos. There they would search for the Aegean Empire's fleet and capture the island.

The Thuran fleet had readied for war, and embarked as the island of Cythera had been recaptured by the Romans. Thurii sent a large part of their fleet to meet the Roman one at Cythera, from there, they would go to Athens to meet with the Admare.

The Praetors are still waiting in Aleppo, news of the battle of Cythera had reached the Council's ears. The officers and Praetors urge the council to take action against Nestor.

A fleet, with the men on board bearing the Med-Black Company's seal, arrive in Cythera. They are stopped by Roman ships and ask what business they have there.

The Macedonians made a brave stand, but the Knights pressed down hard. They were defeated. Philip sent an envoy hoping to seek for peace.

**700 CE**

It had been 6 months since the end of the Ligurian Games. And Rome was embroiled in yet another conflict. Marcus had turned 17. He was managing the household, dealing with clients in a way that would make his father proud.

Privately, the young man had what seemed like the weight of the world on his shoulders. He scarcely had time to rest. He would travel to Sicilia to do business with Thuran traders, then up to Venice to deal with the dreaded Med-Black Company. The Company had been dominating the Venetian markets since their opening in the area. 

He would go back to Rome, where politicians and foreigners would pester him about petty business deals. Marcus saw that Roman Dromon left Rome and Venice nearly everyday. He had heard of the great Roman victory at Cythera. The ""Aegean Empire"" had been pushed back. He also heard of Thurii's declaration of war on the rogue nation. He believed it was the first time Thurii formally declared war on another entity. He still thought of the girl he had met half a year ago. 

On his free time, elderly veterans of the Roman army and navy would come to his house to teach him military tactics, they said it was ""in his blood"" to do this. 

One morning he go a letter from his father, telling him of the situation presently where he was. The letter had instructions that Marcus would read this letter before the Senate. This would be a huge deal for his family if accepted. He would stand before the Julii, Octaviani, Lucii, Romulan, and Scipii families, all very wealthy and powerful men.

As he walked into the Senate, he tried not to have his voice crack. 100 Senators, and two consuls looked down at him. He began:

*Senators of Rome,* 

*My victory at Cythera was a great one, the might of Rome was able to take control of the island and drive the Hellenes from the area back to Melos. I am told the Admare at Athens intends to seize control of Melos next.*

*My victory is not without losses though, over 25 of my Roman ships were damaged severely or sunk. The Aegean Empire employed vast amounts of Greek Fire which was devastatingly effective. If there was any doubt before, it is clear that the Republic of Lebanon is involved. We have not heard word from the Praetors sent to Lebanon. I implore you to send more ships, more men. Let us bring the might of Rome down on these fools*

After Marcus finished the Senate exploded with angry voices. The members aligned with the Cult of Mars were clambering for war. Cooler minds said that they still did not know for sure. And that they should wait for a response from the Praetors sent to Lebanon first.

One of the Senators pointed at Marcus, ""What would the descendant of Pompey the Great do? I'll tell you what he would do, he would conquer and crush the enemies of Rome as if they were insects! The Aegeans cannot withstand the full brunt of a Roman invasion. We should attack and set fire to Euboea!""

Another Senator broke in, ""And risk facing the might of Lebanon, who defeated the Kharaangar, and a rebellion in Egypt *at the same time*. That would be fool's work!""

Marcus snuck out amid the arguing, thinking that politics was not for him. He walked down the Forum where the Tribunal Council was in session as well. He could hear the yelling from that building. He went and got some bread, figs and garum, and headed home.

Rome has continued to blossom along the Mediterranean. The city has turned from a few cottages in the fields, to a sprawling citadel of trade and wonder. Expanding its reach beyond the walls into a full-fledged republic, they have become a dominant power in the Mediterranean Sea. This is in large part to its plentiful trade with many other Mediterranean kingdoms, but especially the two to the country's south: Thurii and Imazighen.

Marcus awoke well past sunrise to his father and family waking him up. He wanted to sleep more, but his family was obligated to watch the Ligurian Games. Marcus knew the events today, and he was not a fan of the sports, Rome wasn't even competing. His eyes looked for the Thuran athletes, maybe he could run into that Thuran girl again.


He ate a quick breakfast,  bread topped with Garum and some figs before heading to the city. Something seemed off...the forum was buzzing about  the new nations that had arisen in Hellas.


 *politics* Marcus thought, rolling his eyes.

He made his way to the Cassian Amphitheater to watch the Gladiator matches. The Lebanese Gladiator was facing off against the gladiator representing the Imazighen. It was a highly anticipated match as both these nations were considered super powers by Rome.

The Berber was a patient and cautious fighter, not exactly exciting to watch, and the Lebanese fighter was a strong, fast, and skilled fighter. As Marcus watched the two gladiators try to get into a favorable position,  he noticed his father was called to the Senate and Tribunal council. It was odd that these institutions were meeting, they should be on leave, Marcus knew that his father being called meant he was going to leave.

Marcus stayed at the amphitheater as the Berber gladiator was able to wear down and defeat the Lebanese gladiator. It was a grueling and not a very entertaining match. Marcus decided he would go to the tavern to meet some of his friends to eat and drink. Then he saw the Thuran girl he had talked to the day before, and decided he would watch the Thuran gladiator fight the Iberian gladiator with her.

They laughed and watched the fight. The Thuran gladiator won easily. Marcus invited her to the tavern with him, and she said sure.

As they walked out of the Cassian Amphitheater, Marcus saw armored men marching down the streets toward the harbor. Seeing this, he asked one of the centurions  what was going on, the man mumbled something about Greeks attacking Roman lands and kept walking. 

Marcus, despondent, rushed home only to see his father packing his military equipment. His father assured him he would be alright and thst Marcus would be head of the household while he was gone, and hold all of the responsibilities.

Marcus was just over 19 years old. He came from a very old and well known family in Rome. His family, owned land in Sicilia, Rome, and Aldermus. He could trace his family back to the days of the early Kingdom of Rome. Now, many of his uncles and cousins held censor or bureaucratic positions in the new Republic. Marcus was not a fan. All of his family worked 10-12 hours per day in government offices. He, along with his younger brothers, and slaves, made sure the fields were plowed and harvested. 

His father was away with his mother, leaving him the de-facto head of the household. He had help, but managing the accounts, and the field was very tiring work.

Being of a wealthy family, Marcus often had to deal with clients of his father. Men asking for loans, for investments, and favors. Marcus had to know how to speak Latin, Gulgean, Greek, and Punic almost every. Single. Day. Marcus would grow up to be like his father, who was a great man.

Marcus would remember his days in Thurii being trained in language, oratory, science and mathematics. He would also remember pining after the girls down there, trying to impress them. Now, he knew that he would be matched with what his father deemed an appropriate match.

Marcus was very popular in Rome, although not because of himself, but because of his family. Every time he made the trip to Rome he saw the monument to his ancestor in the Forum. There he would have a crowd either following him, or he would go in secret. He would get private seats to watch the races at the Circus Maximus, and private seats to watch the fights at the Cassian Amphitheatre. 

These are his stories.

*****

One time Marcus was in Rome, he was there to attend the Ligurian Games that were being held in 700 CE. These games were somber, as they were in remembrance of the fallen Kingdom of Hellas, a great friend of Rome.


He as watching the Gladiator Fights. He had caught the attention of a girl who looked of Greek origin. He was able to strike up a conversation just as the Thuran Gladiator was able to upset and defeat the Roman League Champion. She cheered, he groaned and they laughed at the difference in reaction. He got her name, she was from a wealthy family in Thurii that was here to attend the games. They spoke in Greek, as that was the language the educated spoke in Rome. 

They parted ways as he was to due to go over to watch a relatively new sport imported from the Amirate of Titun B'iwe. Previous concerns over the sport of ukwụbọl were remedied. 

*Another Amirate* he thought to himself. He got to the Circus Maximus a bit after midday as they were clearing the barrier in the center of the track and setting up the field. He looked at the billing and saw the Roman team was playing the team from Lebanon, and after that the team from Titun B'iwe was set to play the team from the Illyrian Empire. 

He cheered, drank and yelled at the umpire. The Romans had won very narrowly, and the Lebanese spectators were less than pleased. All the same, the citizens from the two Republics drank and laughed together a the Taverns. They laughed as the team from Titun B'iwe absolutely destroyed the team from the Illyrian Empire.

*This is gonna become common* Marcus thought.

The taverns sold the ever popular Lebanese Palm Wine and Marcus' posse was able to pay for a round of drinks for the whole tavern. He and a few Lebanese visitors had a great time. He invited them back to eat and drink more at his estate just outside of Rome, but the Lebanese said they had to get back to the visitor's palace.  Just as the sun was setting, Marcus headed home, with the same friends, really clients of his father where they would drink late into the night, and head to Rome again the next day to watch the games again.

Marcus was dissatisfied with how things were. He thought of the Thuran girl at the Cassian Amphitheatre. If only he could have invited her along...

When he got home, his father informed him that they were having an extremely important guest over. The heir of Saxony, Mijamaer Edrikson Theioderiking von Bremen, was courting his father's daughter. 

Marcus groaned, he found the Saxon heir to be a bit impressive and was jealous at the man's charisma. Mijamaer walked in the door boasting and bragging the Saxon's dominance in rowing. When the symposium started, the men passed a krater of wine around, whoever finished the krater, saw an image of the Gorgon on the bottom of the bowl and lost. 

While the men drank well into the night, the women had their own party where they would gossip and tell stories...and of course drink.

Unfortunately, the Aegean Empire and the Lebanese governor of Crete seemed to have other plans...

Under orders from the governor at Crete, the Aegean Empire has seized control of the Roman controlled island of Cythera just south of the Peloponnese. The plans of the Empire are to use this island as a base of operations for raiding the Peloponnese. The Aegean Empire, now armed to the teeth with a full navy, are a formidable foe in the Mediterranean. There presence on Cythera did not go unnoticed though. A Small Roman Dromon scout ship spotted the Aegean fleet landing at Cythera.

The Roman Republic, hearing of raids of the Peloponnese decided to garrison 22,000 men in Hellas, two full legions with 10,000 Crossbowmen. They also intend to send a fleet of 50 Normal Dromon and 30 Heavy Dromon to reingorce the ships already in the area.

The fleet, after escorting and dropping off the Roman army in Achaea, sail south down the Peloponnese. They are approached by their scout letting them know of the Aegean Navy at Cythera.

He split his host in two, having 7,000 of the Hoplites and 1,500 of the bowmen march forward, and he would set up a base camp with 1,000 Hoplites and 500 bowmen to survey the battlefield. 

His General Lysander was able to rally the cities of Sparta and Messene to contribute troops. And Lysander marched on Agamemnon's forces with 4,000 Spartan Hoplites and 1,500 Messenian Bowmen. 

The idea was Lysander's men would meet Xanthias' men and they would wall off Agamemnon's men and drive them into the sea.

The Aegean Empire was able to deploy 12,000 Greeks, mostly Hoplites, to the battlefield. 

Unfortunately, Lysander's men did not hug the southern coast, so the Aegeans were able to get around his men and flank the Peloponnesian forces, this caused great panic for a time. Xanthias responded by using his 1,500 reserve forces to try and push them back.

The main part of the battle, Agamemnon's forces were desperate, and so they fought with more ferocity and were able to gain the upper hand. Their lack of bowmen though kept the fighting at a standstill.

In the attempt to push the flanking enemy back, King Xanthias was killed in the chaos. He bravely lead his men into battle but a thrown spear felled the man. Enraged by the death of their king, the reserves were able to push the flanking force back and force them to route. 

They were then able to rush and flank the remaining Aegean forces and force them to route. A long day of fighting, a killed king, but the invading forces were defeated. 

Xanthias had no sons. Therefore again the Peloponnese looked to the Romans for help. Most of the north and Eastern Peloponnesians would welcome Roman rule, but Lysander, who became fabulously popular among the Southwestern Peloponnesians, wanted to keep their Hellenic independence.

He knew the former Pisidians who lived there had no love, so he decided to put together a fleet to take these islands back. 

But Agamemnon was no fool, he knew that he stodd litte chance against the might of Lebanon. So he held his fleet back, and sent an envoy to treat with the Lebanese governor.

The armies of the two new nations clashed in Arcania. The fighting was fierce as the two armies clashed and fought with much ferocity.

The Macedonians were brave and soon gained the upper hand. That is when the Theban League, who had previously administrated Arcania launched an attack from the rear. King Philip had hoped the war against Thebes in Thessaly would distract them enough.

It was chaos as the Macedonians were slaughtered, and in the mayhem, King Attalus of Epirus was killed. He was loved by the Epirotes and had a reputation of leading his new nation on the battle field. In the ensuing rout, almost every single Macedonian that had invaded Epirus was killed or captured. The Theban army took advantage of their situation and marched on Epirus as well as invading Thessaly. 

Thuran intervetion and support of King Alcibiades in Epirus saved the young kingdom, but not without cost. Many Epirotes recognized Thuran authority just as King Alcibiades did. This gave Thurii unprecedented access to manpower and influence in the region. Thurii is essentially in control of the King and the Kingdom of Epirus.

King Xanthias of the Peloponnese was able to raise over 10,000 Greeks from the peninsula and began is march south against the Aegean Empire's forces. 

King Philip, who was shocked by the quick Theban counter offensive, was brought to the table to discuss peace. The Theban League and the Kingdom of Macedonia were able to come to terms for a temporary peace. This did no apply to the Epirotes and the Macedonians, although it appeared there was lull in the fighting after the invasion of Epirus was destroyed. 

King Philip went back to his capital to lick his wounds and regroup his army. He thought that perhaps an invasion elsewhere would be more successful. He looked East, to the Knights of Jupiter, who were militarily crippled, and prepared for war.

The Northern provinces of former kingdom of Hellas, the Kingdom of Macedonia, has had military success against its neighbors. 

Their superior cavalry and the rough terrain of Macedonia has made their army almost unbeatable in the field. Almost immediately after King Atlas' death, the new Macedonian kingdom invaded Thessaly and pushed the Theban League to the brink. Only an astounding victory by the Central Hellenes stopped the Macedonians at Thermopylae from conqueing all of Aetolia, and Boeotia. The inspired Greeks, then marched on Pharsalus and pushed the Macedonians back into Thessaly.

The two sides were exhausted after nearly ten years of fighting.

The newly independent Kingdom of Epirus to the West of Macedon was the next target for King Philip. Just five years after the end of Philip's war with the Theban League, Philip made like he was going to attack the League once again. The Hellenes rushed to Pharsulus to defend their territory only to hear that the main part of Philip's army crossed over the Albanian Alps to attack Epirus. The undefended territory of the Theban League came under Macedonian control. 

The Thebans did battle with the Macedonians at Pharsalus but neither side were able to gain the upper hand.

King Attalus of Epirus desperately put an army together to march south on the invading Macedonians.

Meanwhile, the Aegean Empire launched an offensive against the Peloponnese and King Xanthias. Emperor Agamemnon put together an invasion force and was able to gain a foothold in the Peloponnese.

When the Roman Admare of the Hellenes heard, he offered Xanthias that he would help destroy the Aegean Empire. King Xanthias, who had ambitions of being king of Hellas, knew that he had to defeat these rival factions on his own to be recognized as a legitimate king.

He soon put together an army of Laconians, Messenians, Achaeans, and Argives and marched to meet Agamemnon's army.

While King Atlas, one of the kings of the Diarchy, was away with the fleet in the Aegean, they were hit by a storm. Unfortunately, he did not make it. This left the *Strategos Thallason* in charge of the Hellenic fleet. 

Back in Hellas, Lekos was now the only king in charge. But when he tried to take command, most of his subjects did not recognize him. While Atlas was away, Lekos was proven to be an unpleasant and ineffective ruler. The Northern provinces of Hellas soon declared their independence. Lekos went to put an army together and annex those territories. He didn't make it very far north as his officers assassinated him.

Officials of the Roman Republic saw the volatile situation and installed a well-liked relative of Atlas, Xanthias, as King of Hellas. Unfortunately, he was not recognized in Athens or Corinth and Rome was forced to seize control of the Isthmus and Attica. Their presence was welcomed as the Romans were able to provide stability for those areas. Unfortunately, they did not have much manpower available, so the Romans instead raised a Hellenic army and installed Xanthias as ruler of the Peloponnese where he was well liked. This was well received and southern Hellas was stable. 

To the north of Attica, the prominent city of Thebes took control. Ruled by an oligarchy, the Thebans looked to assert their hegemony over the rest of Hellas


The northern Macedonian provinces had declared independence first, and their king, Philip, invaded south. They pushed into Thessaly before being soundly defeated by the Thebans. The fighting is at a standstill now.

To the West, the Kingdom of Epirus rose. The King of Epirus, Attalus brought stability to the region but was very vehement about keeping independence. 

On the Aegean, the Hellenic Navy, using the new Liburna, Quadiremes, and Quinqueremes, invaded and conquered the former Pisidian islands. The commander of the navy, Agamemnon, crowned himself Emperor of the Aegean Sea and established his capital in Euboea.

So every year, Roman aristocrats sent their sons down to Thurii to be schooled in these arts. These Romans usually stayed for about six months out of the year.

When the alliance was sealed in 380 CE, Rome and Gulgea were monarchies. Now Rome is a Republic and Gulgea is an Amirate of the Caliphate of Imazighen. The cultural differences between the two nations was something that was becoming apparent. A Roman Temple was burned to the ground just a few decades ago and nothing was done about it. 

Tensions became pretty high in the last century and a half, and Roman aristocrats always thought that Gulgea had ignored Rome and was uncompromising. Rome had a role in the Gulgean war for succession but was forgotten in the chaos. 

Most of the discussion centered around why the Amir did not go through procedure to dissolve the Union. The very thing the Amir cited that the Romans did, is what the Amir did. The most concerning feeling was fear among the Tribunes of the border regions. They wished to get assurance that their provinces were not under danger of attack.

Black dots are Roman ports in other nation's cities. I'll go from West to East.

The second oldest alliance that Rome has is with Thurii. We have provided the fledgling city-state with protection in return for military access. It is Rome that controls the Straits at Sicily and enforces the tariffs and tolls there. With them expanding to Nova Carthago and Corcyra, Rome has extended this alliance to these new cities, which they have graciously accepted. Thurii is Rome's closest ally on the seas and the two nations enjoy freedom of movement, and even have minimal representation in each other's governments. Currently there are 10 *Normalis Navis* class Dromon ships at each of these ports. These ships carry 30 marines. 

Moving East, we go to Venice, where the BlackMed Company has opened up a branch in Venice. They have a few buildings in which they operate out of. I thought that this was noteworthy.

Next we go to the Kingdom of Hellas, where, because of instability in the Aegean, the Hellas has consented to military presence at Corinth and in Athens. The deal was that Roman ships be allowed to dock at these ports in return for Rome's older ships that are being phased out in favor of the Dromon. Rome and Hellas currently enjoy a pretty good diplomatic relations. Rome sent over 30 *Gravis Navis* class Dromon ships to aid in their succession crisis. These ships carry 70 marines. Currently there are 10 *Gravis Navis* ships at both Athens and Corinth.

The Knights of Jupiter is an official protectorate of Rome. The two nations enjoy good diplomatic relations, and have done some heavy trading in the past. Their invasion into Dalmatia has soured things recently, but Rome is loyal to her friends. The Republic saved the Knights from certain destruction from the Empire of Dalmatia. There are three sites that Rome has ships. At each of these ports, five *Levis Navis* class Dromon ships, which have 28 marines, and two *Normalis Navis* class Dromon ships are stationed. 

The last port I want to talk about is the one at Lesbos. Lesbos is an island under the control of the Black-Mediterranean Company, which, to my knowledge, is a shipping company. They are able to exert influence over small areas with coin and their seal grants them access up into the Black Sea, and protection from harassment from the Lebanese Navy. Relations with the Company are okay. It is really too early to tell. They gifted Rome access to Kallonis on Lesbos, this is where we are able to set up Naval operations in the area. 10 *Gravis Navis* Dromon ships are stationed there, in return, the Company set up a branch in Venice. The Company has proved itself resourceful, being able to give information regarding the Kharaanga hordes before Dalmatia smashed them.

The government in Rome wanted an accurate count of the languages that were spoken in the Republic. 

[The results surprised them.](http://i.imgur.com/WDmLJUe.jpg)

The Dominant Language in all the Purple territories is Latin. Most people's first language is Latin and not much else is spoken. You'll notice Venice held out because it is an important administrative center for the region. Another oddity is West Sicily. The reason people speak Latin in West Sicily is because there was intense Romanization after they were annexed. This was not the case in East Sicily, which will be addressed later in this post. 

The Latin that is spoken is Vulgar Latin at this point. Classical Latin is still used for official writing, and for official speeches in the Senate or Tribunal council.

The Brown territory bordering Dalmatia is the lone province where the most spoken language is Dalmatian(or whatever language the Dalmatians speak). 

Blue territories is where the majority of people speak a dialect of Gulgean. The specific dialect can be pointed out [here](http://i.imgur.com/uIdFMZ0.png). As you can see, most Romans speaking Gulgean speak ""Highland"" while only one territory speaks ""Wildland""

Yellow territories speak mainly Greek. Their proximity to Thurii and Hellas has played a part in this. This is misleading because most of these territories were annexed to Rome just recently. There are huge sections of the population that speak Latin, Aldermii, Punic, and even Albanian. 

Sardinia, while part of the Ligurian Empire, was ruled by West Mahgreb for several hundred years (at least as long as I have been in the game). They mostly speak Mahgrebi(?) but intense Romanization is going on. The shift to Latin is already happening.


All citizens of the Republic must be able to at least speak Latin, and all official documents and signs are written in the Latin script and the Bacada script.

**After the battle**

With the Mahgreb army scattered and broken after the loss of their leader, the Roman Imperator breathed a sigh of relief. His blunder before had not gotten back to him. He then saw the devastation. Thousands of Legionnaires, Hoplites and Crossbowmen had been slaughtered. 

Over the next two weeks, the Romans re-organized, the Imperator found himself with a little over 3 legions, and 8,000 hoplites and 4,000 crossbowmen. He sent word to Rome to send for reinforcements, but it was not necessary. When the Romans marched to the cities in Sardinia, the gates were open. The Mahgrebi had been defeated. The commander accepted surrenders from the cities.

The remaining Mahgrebi soldiers that fought were slaughtered, but many of them who surrendered were nursed back to health and sent back to Africa. The Imperator retrieved the body of the King's son, and sent his body back to Africa as well, as a gesture of good faith. 

If anything, the Mahgrebi had gained the respect of the Romans.

**In Rome**

The Senate was overjoyed at the victory. The consul Tiberius addressed the senators and the tribunes.

*Rome has arrived as a major power in the world. We have defeated a mighty kingdom, an old kingdom. Glory to Rome!!*

The Admare and the Imperator Terrae arrived as war heroes, but they saw the horrors of war and the thousands of Romans slaughtered. 

And Sardinia was incorporated into the Republic of Rome.

**In West Mahgreb**

King Hesham quickly heard of the death of his only son. He ordered a grave to be built outside the Royal Palace, nothing to fancy, that's not what Ikram would've wanted. It was simple and humble, gentle yet prominent, just as Ikram had been. The loss was too much for Hesham; he spent most of his time sulking, barely tending to his duties. His already gray hair turned completely white, his beard looked like the snow upon the Grand Mountains. On the last day of his life, he walked slowly, painfully, towards his son's grave, tears in his eyes. He touched the headstone, hands wet from his tears, and simply whispered *""Goodbye, my son. I have failed you.""*

**On the open water**

The enormous Roman fleet sailed off for Sardinia, the young men were eager for action, they were not ready for the horrors of war. The Admare wanted a swift victory, they would escort the dhows carrying the army to Sardinia then split into two fleets. The two fleets would go around the island north and south and block the western portion of the island from West Mahgreb. The Admare pushed ahead, hoping to clear out any scouts or engage the Mahgreb's fleet while still at his strongest.

**Land in sight**

The Admare on the Octere, *Mater Roma* spotted land, it seemed as though there were no ships defending the coast. He urged his ships ahead, leaving the dhows with the troops behind. The rowers were going at full tilt.

*This can't be right.* The Admare thought, *Could we have gotten to Sardinia before the Mahgrebi?*

When he was a mile from the shore, that is when the West Mahgreb navy attacked. Two muriophorio, 10 octeres, 10 heptaremes and 15 hexaremes slipped by the large fleet from the North and were wreaking havoc on the dhows. The Admare panicked and instructed his fleet to turn around and protect the transports.

When he has finally turned around, the marines on the Roman ships looked in horror as dhows were ripped apart by Ballistae and harpoons. The Admare ordered his ships to attack. The marines were obviously baffled at what to do against so many large ships, luckily, the Romans had the numbers advantage. 

The Liburna, Triremes, and Quadiremes were ineffective, being sunk before or damaged before they could get close and their naval rams simply bouncing off the large ships but the Quinqueremes were able to hold their own. Roman Hexaremes were able to pull Mahgrebi ships toward them with their harpax and board them. Slowly, but surely the tide of battle started to turn. 

The Mahgrebi Navy was forced to regroup. Six Octeres, nine Heptaremes, and ten Hexaremes mad a charge. The mere speed at which these vessels moved crushed lighter ships. They beelined straight toward a Roman Octere, hoping to kill the Admare and scatter the Roman navy.

They were able to smash and board the Roman Octere, but the wrong one. Now vulnerable, the Roman navy went to work heavily damaging the remaining ships. Twenty Mahgrebi ships survived, but heavily damaged. 

The Romans had taken serious casualties, all 36 of the Liburna had been destroyed, an Octere, 37 Triremes, 35 Quadiremes, 23 Quinqueremes, and two Hexaremes had been sunk.

They had been able to drive the Mahgrebi fleet away and now the landing was clear...

**On the shore**

The Imperator Terrae was despondent. He calculated his losses at half of two legions were destroyed. He knew he would have to consolidate his forces and plan his strategy. When the dhows reached land he looked to the shore. There he saw the camps. Endless numbers of soldiers were in sight and seemed to be preparing for battle. The Roman army was silent, dumbstruck when a lone voice called out.

A lowly standard bearer, a man who doesnt even fight jumped from the bow of one the dhows with the [golden eagle](http://mindsbehindthemyths.org/wp-content/uploads/4157865929_6597306217.jpg) of Rome and shouted *Are we Romans or not!? To battle!* shaking the standard at the dhows.

There was a roar from the Roman side as the fire of Mars filled them with his bloodlust.

[m] cheesey i know


Ikram Aghbal, esteemed general of the Maghreb Army and son of the Grand King Hesham Aghbal had been tasked with commanding the ragtag bunch of troops. Though large in number, they lacked distinctly in morale, energy and spirit. Straight from the loss in Iberia they had been shipped towards Srdynya, with war seeming to be a constant part of their lives. Ikram was saddened to know how many of the young would die.


**First Contact**


The troops had heard a faint echo of a chant from the coast, a reminder of their true purpose on the pristine island of Srdynya. The shouting gradually grew louder as a line of white skinned warriors approached from the horizon, dressed in armor unfamiliar to the Maghrebis. Ikram rode in front of his troops and thrust his fist towards the air, signalling the archers and cavalry archers to ready their shower shots. But before telling them to release, he yelled one thing to his troops, over the chant of the Romans;
*""We have lived through struggles past, and now with Alum on our side, we overcome desparity! We overcome loss! We overcome being tired! And we shall overcome this final enemy!""*

The troops shouted and screamed, ready to loose their arrows towards the rushing line of Romans, and soon enough, that they did. The sky turned black with the sheer number of bodkin arrows and bolts thrown into the air, and Romans began to fall left and right with the descent of the cloud.

**Feint Attacks and Disarray**

The light cavalry, armed with chain armor and shotels shot forth and engaged the frontlines of the Romans. Their shotels poked through the weaknesses in their armor, jabbed around their shields and caused havoc among the soldiers. To add on to the confusion, as soon as the Romans would regroup, the cavalry would rush back at full speed, drawing the lines forwards into arrow fire from archers, and from the retreating cavalry archers. However, the Romans were not stupid, and soon sent their hoplites to deal with the cavalry attacks. They were dreadfully effective, ripping through the light cavalry quickly and efficiently. Ikram sent in his units wielding maces to deal with this problem. They were some of the bravest soldiers Ikram had ever seen, their arms swinging in devastating arcs, crushing the shields, armor and bones of those that dared to stand in their path. With this mass confusion, Ikram used the opportunity to send in all he had, with infantry and heavy cavalry coming in to aid.


**Mass Charges**

The heavy cavalry went first, armed with the Maghreb Lance, or Allagh, charging head first into the ranks of Romans, further disorienting them. Their full steel armor helped them to repel much of the assault of the Romans. On top of this, the main bulk of infantry, carrying curved longswords, pushed in behind the cavalry, taking down row after row of Roman soldiers. However, their Hoplites would soon be able to regather and repel the cavalry, destroying almost all of the heavy cavalry in sight. Now it came down to the battle of the infantry, and that battle was leaning towards the Maghreb. Their weapons were superior, their shotels ripped through armor and shield, their curved longswords gave them a reach advantage over the roman legionnaries, and the spears formed a defensive backbone for all of the infantry units. To add to the confusion, Maghreb arrows continued to rain down on top of the Romans, with some fire arrows being thrown into the mix, setting the ground behind the Romans aflame. All of their success was due to the leadership of Ikram. However, the army from the North, originally heading towards Samal Srdynya headed south to join their brothers.

**A Flank and Death's Hand**

Ikram knew they were coming. The Romans surely would've had more troops than the ones being desecrated now, it only made sense. Ikram slapped himself for being so stupid as to ignore this fact. Soon, they crossed over the Northern Hills and were flanking the Maghreb troops, causing panic and despair throughout the lines. A retreat was ordered by Ikram, he had a plan.

Even with the addition of new troops, the Romans were still outnumbered and technologically inferior. With this in mind, Ikram had devised a grand strategy. He would surround the Roman army in semicircle, with infantry and remaining cavalry collapsing the formation while bowmen shot from behind. Unfortunately, the Romans had different plans.

Ikram left his planning tent and began the intricate movements necessary for his plan to work. He rode his horse to the top of a hill and started gesturing at his troops, telling them where to go and how to attack. Halfway through, a Roman arrow, which had constantly been flying towards their army, struck Ikram straight through the back of his head, and out of his eye. Perhaps due to his lack of sleep, and his lack of spirit, he had forgotten to put on his helmet. This would be a devastating blow for the Maghreb Army.


The troops did not know what to do. Their main general had been killed in front of their eyes, and they could not complete the formation themselves. They quickly were spread to thin, too erratically, too sparsely and too unorganized to be an effective force. The Romans took the advantage and charged among the confusion. It was slaughter. Maghrebis fell left and right, as the Romans relentlessly charged. Though many casualties were suffered by the Romans, they were easily victorious; they marched on both Janub and Samal Srdynya, taking the cities under their control. The Maghreb army, or what was left of it, was allowed to live, a generous offer by the Romans. For the Maghrebis, it was over, the dust of Ukartum had settled over them. They were defeated.

The Senate was just convening when a runner came. Word had spread, the great Iberian Empire and the Kingdom of West Mahgreb were at war. Rome had always been friendly with both of the kingdoms. They had set trade lanes in the Western Mediterranean with both of them. Now, goods from the west were at risk of being disrupted. 

Members of the Cult of Mars clamored for war...but with who? Iberia was a relatively new nation, West Mahgreb was one of the oldest nations Rome has come in contact with and one of the principal powers in the Mediterranean. Their navy was famed. It was from the Mahgrebi the Romans got designs for the Octere. These Octeres served as the capital ships of the Roman fleet. 

The consul Tiberius, now a young man, thought to himself. *West Mahgreb has dominion over Sardinia, but the Iberians would be an easier target.*

Some of the senators had been grumbling over why Rome allowed such a powerful neighbor have an island so close to the Republic. Others wanted glory. By the end of the session, the Cult of Mars had consumed the Senate and the Tribunal council. 

A lone dhow was set for Sardinia with a declaration of war on the Mahgrebi. 

The Consul called up on the Imperator Terrae Marcus Pompeius Secundius, the son of Pompeius the Great, to command the ground forces and Imperator Ad Mare Gaius Celer to command the Navy. Together, they drew up a plan for war. 

 An invasion force on the scale that had never been seen by the Romans was put together. Five legions were raised, 25,600 legionnaires, with a support force of 12,000 Hoplites and 10,000 Crossbowmen.  260 ships with 19,180 marines were raised. Two enormous Octeres and Twelve Hexaremes, escorted by 36 Liburna were commissioned. With these ships, eighty Quadiremes, eighty Triremes, and fifty Quinqueremes were commissioned.

2 months after the declaration of war, the enormous force set out to invade Sardinia.


**In West Mahgreb**

The news of war from the Romans quickly reached the ears of the aged King Hesham Aghbal. There was little response from him, besides a defeated sigh. His armies were tired, bloodied and broken from the battle with Iberia and the Jews. He knew little of what he could do, besides send these poor men to their deaths. Unfortunately, that is the only thing he was able to do.

A grand army of 84,000 troops was assembled and sent into the outposts of Sardinia. They were equipped with the standard repertoire of the Western Maghreb, curved longswords, shotels, recurve crossbows, maces and composite recurve bows. However, he knew he would also need a navy, however there was little left from the battles with the Jewish enemies. He sent what he had.

The navy was pitiful at best, consisting of 2 muriophorio, 10 octeres, 10 heptaremes and 15 hexaremes. The king knew this was not enough, but there was nothing to be done, war was upon him. He prayed to Alum that the young men of his country would be safe.

The troops were rapidly transported to Sardinia, setting up guard towers and walls where they could. The two main ports of Janub Srdynya and Samal Srdynya fielded the navy, or at least what was left of it. Every young man in the army knew that their cause was futile. If they had not beaten the Jews, they knew they stood no chance against a far more dangerous enemy. Broken and battered, they set up defensive lines along the coast, ready fire volleys of arrows and assault the lines of their enemies. There was little chance of success, but Alum knew they would try.

King Hesham sat alone in his throne room. He had nobody to comfort him. His son was a general, off on Srdynya, and his wife was long dead. He rested his head on the back of his magnificent throne, and quietly wept to himself in the dead of night, when nobody could question his tears.",HistoricalWorldPowers,The Roman conquest of Sardinia,http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWorldPowers/comments/3a3w2o/the_roman_conquest_of_sardinia/
