1. The way multireddits are handled. It is amazingly easy to create a new one, and the recent addition of the ability to add a subreddit to a multi from that sub's sidebar has been quite lovely. 
2. Color coding of subs. This is highly useful on the Frontpage and even more so in multireddits, and I have not seen another client that does this. 
3. The ability to preview the first paragraph of a selftext post when in the list view. This has saved me a lot of time because it makes it super easy to skip past content I don't care for. The only annoyance is when OP is a faggot and doesn't use paragraph breaks, so I end up having to deal with a monster block of text while scrolling through the list view.

97,"&gt;Running is a very primal movement. I have recently become inspired by the purity of it. Many people have found running a good relief from a stressful day and a good way to get some exercise and the trend is growing. According to the USA Track &amp;amp; Field website, American Sports Data, Inc. reports greater than 35 million people run per year, greater than 10 million being “frequent runners,” running greater than 100 times per year. There is not another sport more popular or convenient to do.

&gt;I say convenient because, while it is quite easy to grab your shoes and head out the door for a jog, it is definitely not simple. This is evidenced by the injury rate. I don’t want to get too into the statistics of injury rates, but I think everyone would agree they are high in runners. I’m not as concerned about exact numbers, but what can be done about it?

&gt;I have an athletic background, but have always been more the sprinter/explosive type of athlete. It just came easier to me, so that is where I gravitated. Not only that, but I haven’t known many long distance runners who don’t have some sort of ache or pain, so I just assumed long distance running was bad. As I became more educated about the body and have experimented with running personally (even running with minimalist shoes), testing logic and common sense, I have come to believe that running injury-free is possible.

&gt;Pain is a ‘stop’ sign from the body. I recently saw a post on facebook from a friend asking for input. He had recently started running and had developed shin pain. Should he keep running or stop? Cue the cascade of advice and traditional fix-its to cure his shin splints. The simple answer is, when your body hurts, it is telling you to stop. The more complicated question is WHY is he in pain?. The pain began for a reason and the solution is not to simply alleviate pain, but to identify underlying cause or, commonly, causes. I am going to address several common causes of running injury including: too much too soon, weakness, inefficiency in joints and poor control of the lower extremities

&gt;##Too Much Too Soon

&gt;This one is simple. Our body adapts, positively or negatively, to stresses applied. When beginning a running program or increasing mileage, one has to adhere to the principles of training: specificity, overload, recovery, adaptation, and reversibility. This simply says, if you want to run you have to: run, progressively run farther, don’t run too far, and if you stop running you will lose what you have gained. We sit A LOT as a culture, and with any prolonged posture, we are applying the principles of training to become good sitters, not runners. Think about the person who sits too much. He looks like a chair.

&gt;##Weakness

&gt;Weakness plays a primary role in running injury. We Americans are crunched for time and when time becomes limited, exercise is one of the first things to go, leading to weakness. This problem is compounded by sedentary office jobs. Muscles control joint mechanics, absorb ground reaction forces on impact and propel our bodies forward as we run. When muscles are weak, they are unable to adequately perform, exposing joints to higher forces and allowing joints to rotate off-axis. This leads to inefficient movement, abnormal stress on joints and, frequently, injury. A proper strengthening program can be an excellent way to proactively evade injury or return from injury. Running is a complicated high level movement so many times what people assume is an adequate strengthening program is ineffective and falls short of preparing them to run. I am in total agreement with Mike Boyle, an excellent strength coach out of Boston, who argues one must be fit to run, not run to be fit.

&gt;##Inefficient Joints

&gt;Inefficiency of joints due to limited or increased mobility is multifactoral, related to long-term adaptations of soft tissues to prolonged postures, abnormal stresses on joints due to poor posture, prior injury, or aberrant habitual movement patterns. The list could go on, but the take-away is that abnormal stresses on joints lead to inefficiency and stress and can lead to injury or poor performance. Corrective exercise is essential to maintaining a healthy musculoskeletal system, but sometimes falls short in ability to correct joint restrictions. If a joint cannot achieve a position because of a stiffness, strengthening alone is not adequate. However, joints and soft tissue restrictions can be externally mobilized to improve joint mechanics and length-tension relationships of muscles, leading to a reduction in pain and injury and improvement in performance.
 
&gt;##Poor Control

&gt;Joints provide the structure for movement, muscles control joints, and nerves (nervous system) control muscles. If the nervous system becomes disorganized in it’s ability to recruit muscles for running, then movement becomes uneconomical and energy is wasted. This causes performance to suffer and stresses tissues in ways they are not meant to handle stress, eventually leading to injury. This process of injury can be interrupted with proper training of trunk and leg muscles through various techniques so that muscles will fire with the necessary force, in the proper sequence and at the right time to facilitate injury-free running.

I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess that you are the kind of patent attorney whose work involves looking out for some company's patent interests, rather than the other kind of patent attorney who litigates against bad patents. 

Not that there's anything wrong with that, but I sense a bias in favor of corporate interests. Whereas for my own part I'm biased against ""patent trolls"" because I've spent so much of my free time reading about all the bullshit that goes on nowadays. 

I also follow copyright stuff and am very much incensed about the Oracle vs Google situation that's currently playing out, so please forgive my slight hostility at this juncture. ",2016-05-11 14:26:49+00:00,d31bd9w,17.0,t1_d31b1gk,471.0,Android

230,"&gt; That's what patents are for. Doing something new.

This isn't technically wrong, but it's very incomplete. Patents are intended to encourage progress by granting people who come up with novel inventions a *temporary* monopoly in exchange for them disseminating information about how their invention works so that, once the patent expires, anyone skilled in the art can read the patent and recreate the invention using the instructions in the document.

Patents aren't just handed out to anyone who comes up with something ""new""; there are criteria against which patent submissions are to be checked, which *in theory* should keep out the bad patents. In particular, the invention has to be **non-obvious** to someone ""**skilled in the art**"", and in determining this the patent examiners are supposed to look at ""**prior art**"", i.e. what others have done before, and certify that the invention does in fact constitute a significant contribution that is not an obvious next step to something that already exists. I would argue that in this case there is more than enough prior art for music playback / sorting on non-portable devices to render this patent too obvious to qualify for protection. 

Going back to keeping bad patents out, nowadays the incentives are very much perverted in favor of granting as many patents as possible. The USPTO (United States Patent and Trademark Office) makes money on every patent submission, and rubber stamping bad patents for some extra cash has pretty much become standard operating procedure in recent years. The burden of proof has heavily shifted to rest upon the people/companies on the receiving end of patent threats, which is unfortunate because the legal costs associated with defending against bogus patent claims can be enough to cause a truly innovative small business to become insolvent and go out of business. 

That's why many people arguing for patent reform compare patents to a tollbooth that really just slows down innovation. Patent lawsuits become a tax that new entrants have to pay in order to ""play"" in the marketplace, or in other words they constitute a significant barrier to entry. This is not what progress looks like, and likely not what was intended for the patent system when it was first envisioned.",2016-05-11 13:42:40+00:00,d319my2,13.0,t1_d30kfyf,54098.0,Android

I accidentally discovered this when my keyboard started glitching out and disconnecting / lagging on input, and now I can consistently reproduce it. Every time I separate the two by severing the magnetic connection, Slide refreshes. Because this keyboard has been annoyingly glitchy lately, randomly losing connection and then reconnecting, Slide has been refreshing everything and losing my place a lot more frequently. When this happens, I also lose whatever comment I may have been writing / editing at the time, which really sucks.

328,"Rejection hurts, and trust me and the others who have posted that we too have suffered through it. I have definitely had some very dark moments in my life, especially in the latter half of college, after a relationship that came out of nowhere ended equally abruptly and without a satisfying explanation. There were times when thoughts of suicide kept coming back despite my attempts to push them away using logic and reason, and although I never made any attempts to even acquire the means to carry out the act, I would engage in frequent mental fantasies about dying in various ways. I had dreams of drowning myself or jumping in front of a moving vehicle or taking pills to off myself, et cetera.

I retreated into myself and very nearly failed out of the (prestigious) college I was attending, but somehow (with the help of friends and family) I managed to get through it and get my degree, albeit a year late. The year between graduation and the start of my first legit full time job was challenging too, although much less so than the final year of college. Now I am happily employed, although obviously I'm not the biggest fan of having much less free time than I used to, and yet I am still single (and have been for the last 3+ years since that failed 4-month relationship). However I have dedicated myself to fitness, specifically running, and even when I don't feel like getting my workouts in for whatever reason I push myself to do so anyway and end up feeling a lot better afterwards.

I am no closer to having a girlfriend (or boyfriend, an option I am increasingly considering now that I have more fully embraced my fluid sexual preferences, thanks to the numerous LSD trips I have had in the last year), but nevertheless I am a happier and more confident person. You don't need someone else to make you feel like you are worth something. What you need is to find something that you can be good at (which will involve putting in the time and effort necessary to make that happen) and derive pride and satisfaction from it. Find a career that inspires passion in you (for me this is the realm of IT, and I am currently a web developer) and pursue the heck out of it. And of course find something you enjoy doing in your free time (for me this is running, biking, and reading stuff, whether in books or on the Internet, in order to increase my knowledge and understanding of both myself and the outside world).

It's cliche to say this, but it gets better. Give yourself the chance to get out there and be your awesome self. You have lots of opportunities to explore new things, as others have said, in college and also beyond. Adulthood can be challenging and at times just downright miserable, but if you play your cards right you can also achieve a satisfying sense of freedom and self-sufficiency if you keep at it and look towards the future. I still get melancholy about being single from time to time, but a good acid trip will remind me that I am an attractive and intelligent person who is deserving of love, and the first place this love has to come from is within myself.

I have lots more to say on the subject but I have already rambled enough for now. Feel free to PM me if you want to chat more in-depth. :)",2016-03-29 00:56:04+00:00,d1h394o,1.0,t3_4ccaod,12095.0,INTP

389,"OK, I've tried typing this comment several times but it disappeared twice, for different reasons: 

1. One: when I scrolled up away from the create comment text box in order to refer back to my original comment, the comment disappeared but I still got the ""Discard comment?"" dialog whenever I tapped on another comment to expand the comment action bar.
2. Two: after navigating to the thread by tapping on the message in my inbox (which BTW doesn't always happen on the first tap), I was initially in partial thread view so I tapped ""view full comments"" and started writing my reply to your comment. However, at some point Slide randomly decided to revert back to the partial comments view, which made my comment disappear entirely (no ""Discard comment?"" dialog this time).

OK, so getting that out of the way, here are my additions/clarifications:

1. One: my initial comment with the 3 issues actually contains an ordered list, where ""When tapping..."" is list item 1, ""When the previous/next..."" is list item 2, and ""Although the changelog..."" is list item 3. Also, this very comment contains two instances of ordered lists, although this time I got smart and prefaced them with ""One"", ""Two"", etc. so that it's more obvious that it's supposed to be a list.
2. Two: it seems that the padding below the last comment gets added correctly when in partial comments view (i.e. when the ""view full comments"" button is present, which BTW is hard to read because of the white text on light gray background), but not after expanding to full comments view.

Hope this helps!

1. When tapping on a comment to reveal the buttons for interacting with it, the comment gets left justified and no longer has any padding to the left of the colored vertical line to show the depth level of the comment in the comment tree. 
2. When the previous/next comment arrows are enabled, they cover up the bottom comment and make it super hard to interact with the comment buttons (e.g. upvote, downvote, etc.), although with some very precise touching it is still possible since the comment options bar is slightly taller than the comment navigation arrows (oddly this doesn't happen all the time).

423,"Another thing that might contribute to some people's obsession / fascination with feet is the social taboo around them that few people seem to talk about. I started wearing [Vibram Five Fingers](https://us.vibram.com) just over 3 years ago and boy have I gotten a lot of weird looks / sarcastic comments as a result. Going barefoot entirely is even worse, because apparently everyone is super terrified of the pretty unlikely scenario of stepping on something sharp enough to puncture the skin (an irrelevant concern for the most part unless you are oblivious to where you're walking and/or live in a really rough area with tons of broken glass and used needles or some shit like that). 

But yeah, people getting offended by seeing shoes shaped like feet because ""feet are gross""? Definitely a taboo in my book. IMHO feet might be the most underrated and neglected body part. Although they are crucial to our ambulatory mobility as bipeds and are a pretty amazing feat of evolutionary engineering, we stuff them into stiff and restrictive foot coffins and then wonder why we start seeing all sorts of foot-related ailments. Feet were meant to have unrestricted range of motion, in order for us to be able to navigate challenging and rugged terrain, but now most people's feet suffer from stunted development. Our toes get bunched up together due to growing up wearing restrictive shoes, and as a result we lose the balance and flexibility that we would naturally have if our toes were allowed to splay (spread out) naturally.

535,"For me, LSD decreases the perception of effort expended while running and helps me pay better attention to my form (I run in Vibrams). It also makes me enjoy running more, due to the rather common ""child-like wonder"" effect of the substance, which makes ordinary things seem new and interesting again. While running, this effect takes a mostly visual form, making my boring route seem alive and interesting due to the LSD visuals that make textures of stuff animated (e.g. if you look at asphalt or concrete, which happens a lot while running in a suburban area, the ""grains"" in those textures move around in a visually appealing way). However, it also enhances my ""mind-chatter"" while I run, making me feel more connected to the world in a spiritual way and thankful for being able to run.

I'm sure I'm missing some things, but if you want I can pay close attention the next time I run-trip and write something more in-depth (and fresher in my memory).",2016-01-06 17:49:24+00:00,cyo91nl,,t1_cyk70to,,running

&gt;Doing the extend-trip thing isn't actually that great.

I can confirm this; it's pretty much just a waste of good acid, so I too would advise against it. ",2015-07-08 06:00:26+00:00,csvx3q0,4.0,t1_cske9ji,932505.0,Drugs
676,"I very much agree with what /u/AellaGirl said, and I'd like to add that tripping with a really close friend can be even more fulfilling. I helped my friend through his very first trip as I was tripping balls myself, and although at one point I got a bit too much into my own trip, once my trip stabilized post-peak, I was able to really connect with him on a whole new level. 

A word of caution, though: tripping with someone can be a very intimate experience, and indeed you are likely to develop an attachment to the person whom you trip with (or even who just trip sits you). For me and my friend, it turned into taking our oft-discussed shared bisexual preference and actually putting it into practice (by doing the sexy things together, lol). 

Oh, and one more thing: tripping is very likely to help you engage with your Fe (at the bottom of the INTP cognitive function stack) and make you a more caring / emotional person. If this happens, take full advantage of it to improve yourself and become a more balanced person (Aella hinted at this when she said that she deviated from the strictly rational path of the INTP).

I've had this happen quite recently with a local INTP I met off of reddit (/u/psychothumbs). I got all excited because, after stalking his reddit briefly, I discovered that we see a lot of things very similarly. My internal reaction can probably best be described as getting an intellectual boner (lol), so I probably came off too strong at first. Luckily, he possesses the stereotypical INTP ""chillness"", so after a couple of ""sorry""s from me and ""no worries"" from him we pretty much sorted it all out.
