Hence I thought it might make more sense to post to a non drug-specific sub (and for some reason I don't feel comfortable posting in /r/drugs) such as this one. 

**Question**: has anyone here gone down the path of questioning their gender and then subsequently deciding that they are trans within a fairly short time span of starting psychedelic use (less than 2 years in my case)? Although I have spent *a lot* of time thinking about this issue while sober, and in fact my psychedelic use has decreased contemporaneously (but not necessarily causatively) with my transgender journey (which has ramped up within the last 4 months), I have this nagging feeling of ""what if?"" with regard to my psychedelic use. As in, what if I had never done LSD? Would I still have concluded that I very much want my body to become that of a woman (with obvious medical caveats), either 1) at all, or 2) significantly later in life? 

I tried searching on reddit before starting to even consider writing this post, but I didn't find satisfying results and so I'm here somewhat nervously posing this question. I'm not sure why I'm nervous, because I am feeling pretty confident about my decision to transition (which has not entailed any physical changes just yet but stay tuned because I hope to start HRT before the year is out), despite the epic shitstorm that has erupted as a result of me failing to keep my mouth shut and prematurely coming out to my mom, who is to put it lightly, flipping the fuck out about it and tells me I'm destroying my life and it's destroying her to watch (talk about an epic level guilt trip, sheesh). I guess maybe I'm nervous about the answers I'll get, even though I know that this sub is more open-minded and understanding than most. Ah well, here goes anyway.

Granted, the band is Swiss and they don't seem to have the most amazing grasp on the English language, but looking past their odd lexical formulations I found that there is actually a lot of psychonautic substance in their work. I had paid some attention to the lyrics of their other stuff and definitely enjoyed listening, but this particular album, titled ""Era One"", is especially trippy since it does away with the heavy metal sound of their main albums and goes off in a more electronic sound direction. 

Anyway, enough background - [here](https://youtu.be/cOUPXzn4xRE) is the song I wanted to focus on in this post, with [lyrics](http://www.metrolyrics.com/universal-soul-lyrics-samael.html).

I interpret the song as touching upon the ""occult"", or hidden, world that we are not always aware of in our daily waking lives. However when we trip, or engage in sober deep spiritual activities, we start down the path of ""remodeling our own life's conception [and] opening views of another dimension"". What we discover is ""a home of outstanding proportions radiating from [our] own reflection"", the collective consciousness or ""Universal Soul"" that we forget we are a part of. In the process we peel away some layers (of our onion-layered selves), ""digging [our] views a little deeper"" and potentially shaking up our belief systems as we learn more about ourselves.

I may be reading too much into these lyrics, but if you listen to some of the band's other material, you'll notice similar themes touching upon freeing your mind and questioning things you were taught by society / religion / etc. that previously seemed sancrosact but upon closer examination turn out to be means of controlling and instilling fear. Another favorite of mine: [Slavocracy](https://youtu.be/aMzWysnhr5c)

Thanks for reading - there was more I wanted to say but I don't have the time right now to fully expand upon those ideas. Hope you find some value in my post-trip ramblings!
