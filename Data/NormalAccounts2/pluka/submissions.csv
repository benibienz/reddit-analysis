We want to play a lot and practice before ranked comes out so that when it does we can already be decent as a team.

I was plat earlier this season but after taking some time off decayed to gold 1.  I don't really care about ranking all that much, just as long as everyone wants to improve.

Im a college student so if anyone was looking to play everyday this wont work for you, sorry. The eventual goal for this would be to play in some online tournaments but i realise that would take awhile of playing together.  I want this to be a serious thing so im looking for people that can adapt to the meta, want to play as a team and not just see how many kills you can get, and can take losses well and learn from them.  Also I use skype but that could be decided on as a team after this part is done.  If anyone is interested comment or PM your ign and we can talk.  Thanks guys.",TeamRedditTeams,[NA]-[S]-[Any Rank]-[LF All Roles]-[Ranked 5v5],http://www.reddit.com/r/TeamRedditTeams/comments/3bfyz2/nasany_ranklf_all_rolesranked_5v5/
