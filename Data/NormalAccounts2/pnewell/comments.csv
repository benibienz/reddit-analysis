So...the problem isn't with models, it's with what you wrongly thought the models said. 

Models suggest that as warm water provides more fuel for hurricanes, there would be an increase in the most intense hurricanes (ones that can survive the increased windshear) and a decrease in the less intense ones (which succumb to windshear.)

So far, the sample size is too small to detect a change in hurricanes as a result of GHG emissions. But that doesn't mean there hasn't been one, or that there won't be one. [See GFDL for a detailed discussion](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/global-warming-and-hurricanes/). 

Scientists can say individual events are worse because of a simple relationship between temperature and moisture. Warm air holds more moisture. More moisture in the air means more rain when a storm breaks. 

Warmer air also means more energy in the system (because heat is energy) which is part of what drives the ""engine"" of storms, the temperature gradient between warm and cold air. ",2016-10-21 18:04:59+00:00,d92229b,2.0,t1_d921ifb,679,science

Cautious optimism is most definitely warranted. Is it too little too late? Only if we never do more than this, which is unlikely given how technological progress works. Renewable energy gets better and cheaper as it scales up, and this is a huge commitment to do so. 

I think of it as a snowball at the top of the hill. The world's gotten together and rolled this admittedly mediocre ball to the top of the hill.

Present tense is justified: 

&gt;South of Mar-a-Lago, where the elevation is lower, water already pools in the road in front of the Trump Hollywood condos after the briefest of cloud bursts. 

And future concern is much sooner than 127 years: 

&gt;Bolter’s modelling suggests Trump’s Hollywood condos could be turned into islands for up to 140 days a year by 2045, cut off from the low-lying A1A coastal road because of tidal flooding and storm surges. Under a category two storm, a storm surge could wash right up to the front gate.

&gt;Further south, the Trump Grande in Sunny Isles also faces a soggy future, according to the projections.

Yeah, of course. 

&gt;I think the main reason most alarmist don't say anything on natural or accidental coal fires is...

Well that's a nice list and all, and that's possible... or like your Quora link mentioned, it's because it's at MOST a tiny fraction of the total, AND it will be reduced with reduced coal dependence. ",2016-04-27 21:11:42+00:00,d2jukiv,11.0,t1_d2jszjo,2079,climateskeptics
877,"Yay, a real source! And what a surprise, it's a tiny portion of emissions: 

&gt;The USGS was silent on the percentage of the worlds CO2 emissions were related to coal seam fires, but sources suggest a range of from 0.3% to 3.0%. 

...

&gt;Whether the factors are 0.3% or 3% contributions to global warming, and whether mercury emissions from coal seam fires climbs is relatively immaterial. Stopping coal generation and mining will eliminate numerous coal seam fires annually, and allow the fires' contributions to be mitigated by significant reduced emissions from controlled thermal generation and other uses.

So there's the answer as to why no one's focused on it. Because it's only a tiny portion of the problem, and once we're not burning coal on purpose it becomes even less of a problem. 

&gt;And they do use dumb (vapor) stacks pics all them time. 

Yes, that's my point. Why would they be using sterile pictures of white vapor if they could be using pictures that are literally described as hell on Earth? If it's about making money, why wouldn't they use this as a prop to do so? If the goal is to alarm people into submission, why use water vapor if you can use actual flames? With the whole ""global warming"" thing, wouldn't the ground literally on fire make a perfect image?

The warmed water and glycol loop is passed alongside a loop of liquid carbon dioxide, causing the liquid CO2 to boil into a vapor.

A compressor squeezes the vapor, increasing its pressure up to 2,000 psi, which raises the vapor temperature dramatically from 100 to 194 degrees.

The heated CO2 vapor is exposed to yet another loop: the water that circulates through the SeaLife Center's building. It can heat 100-degree water to 194 degrees.

&gt;Evidence from long term coral records did not show the signatures of coral bleaching, even though those corals would have been through many El Niño events. Hughes explains:

&gt;""It’s only since 1998 that the extra spikes [from El Niño] cause problems. We had El Niños for centuries but they don’t show bleaching.
&gt;Because it’s pristine [in the reef’s north], it’s not got the issues with run-off [from agriculture and coastal development] and it should better be able to bounce back.

The petition included a cover letter by Dr. Fred Seitz. Dr. Seitz notes in the letter that he was the president of the National Academy of Science. While this is true, it failed to note his much more recent occupation-consultant for R.J. Reynolds, director and shareholder in a coal-based power company, and chairman of the George C. Marshall Institute.

The petition was first released in 1998, with a cover letter from Dr. Fred Seitz, then again in 2007. The petition asks signers to refute the scientific basis for the Kyoto treaty and recommend its rejection.

The letter was accompanied by a research review article stating that the earth was cooling, not warming. The article used the same font and formatting as the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), going so far as to include a date and volume number, even though it was not a publication of the National Academy. 

[It was so misleading the National Academy took the unprecedented step of issuing a press release stating](http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=s04201998), “the manuscript was not published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences or in any other peer-reviewed journal.” In the 2007 release, the article had finally found a publisher-the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons, which is not only c[ompletely irrelevant to climate science, but also a blatantly conservative journal](http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/91/strange-bedfellows), opposing mandatory vaccines and against telling kids about the dangers of guns, for example.

So while 30k may sound like a lot, most are not specialist, half just have a BS, and only 39 are actually climate scientists.

Even still, if all the names are real, they are far outnumbered by every major National Academy of Science and every major scientific group, [which have all made statements supporting the consensus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change).

Continuing, Fred Seitz who penned the letter, was a spokesman for tobacco. Until, in 1988, [they considered him](http://tobaccodocuments.org/pm/2023266534.html?pattern=fred%5ba-z%5d*W+seitz%5ba-z%5d*&amp;#p1) ""quite elderly and not sufficiently rational to offer advice."" So ten years AFTER R.J. Reynolds finds him too irrational to shill for tobacco, he's going on about climate change.

[NASA GISS Director Gavin Schmidt](http://mashable.com/2016/01/20/2015-hottest-year-record/#5x25HKFzOkq7): 

&gt;“What we have here is something else. The El Niño that we’re seeing is starting at the end of 2015, and so there hasn’t been enough time for that to really have an impact on the annual mean temperatures,” Schmidt said.

&gt;“So 2015 was warm even though there was an El Niño, and it would’ve been a record year even if you abstract out the El Niño affect, 2015 would’ve been a record warm year by a long chalk,” Schmidt said, using a British term meaning “by far.”

Century-long observed trends in precipitation, temperature, and sea-level pressure, supported by climate model results, strongly suggest that anthropogenic forcing has increased the probability of severe and persistent droughts in this region, and made the occurrence of a 3-year drought as severe as that of 2007−2010 2 to 3 times more likely than by natural variability alone.

Again, don't just strawman. It's not that climate change causes all terrorism always and forever. It's that it exacerbates existing tensions by heightening resource scarcity. 

Let's have a little example. There's a car wreck on the highway. It's raining, the car was speeding, and the motorist couldn't stop in time when there was traffic, slamming into the car in front. 

What caused the accident? Speeding? Traffic? Or rain? We know more people wreck in the rain, right? 

Does that mean rain causes accidents? By your logic no, rain has nothing to do with accidents because there isn't a crash every single time it rains, and not all crashes occur in the rain. But we know that when it rains, there are more accidents than on dry days, because wet roads make it harder to stop in time. 

Climate change is like the wet road. It doesn't cause terrorism, but it sets up conditions that allow terrorism to thrive.

Others made earnest pleas for action against global warming, and **the atmosphere was mostly calm until a group of masked anarchists clad in black arrived on the scene.**

FTA: 

&gt;The big knock against renewables such as wind and solar is that they are intermittent; the wind doesn't always blow and the sun doesn't always shine. That means large amounts of energy storage are needed to save up excess power generated when these technologies are going full bore, which can then be tapped when they are low. Storage adds substantial cost and complexity to a renewable energy system.  But Jacobson has an answer. By using a smart mix of technologies that complement one another during different parts of the day and different weather conditions, storage can be kept to a minimum.

No, because the warming we have now is only fully accounting for the CO2 released at the start of the industrial revolution. It takes centuries for the full potential of CO2 to warm the atmosphere. 

If the warming were instant, you'd have a point. But it's not, because of the lag in the system that is a product of feedback loops.

A) I agree that it's hard to trust China's numbers on anything, including emissions. That's why it's such a win that the Paris agreement has inspection measures, so that WE can measure China's emissions, instead of trusting them to do it, like we do now. 

B) The Chinese government released this info back in Feb. and it's made some blog-level and [online news](http://fortune.com/2015/09/17/china-coal) since then. Meaning that UN reports on emission plans and negotiations and such have been using this number basically all year.

COP 21: [258 million](https://www.google.com/search?q=COP+21&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8) results, and it hasn't even happened yet, so the month leading up to, coverage during, and post-COP discussion has all yet to happen. 

COP 20: [272 million results](https://www.google.com/search?q=COP+20&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8). So maybe you're right! But we all know one point does not a trend make. Moving on...

COP 19: [233 million](https://www.google.com/search?q=COP+19&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8). Uh-oh, significantly less than we've already gotten for COP 21.

&gt;“The cigarette companies actively denied the harm of cigarette smoking, and concealed the results of what their own research developed,” she said. “The motivation was money, and to avoid regulation.”

&gt;“It appears to me, based on what we know so far, that there was a concerted effort by Exxon and others to confuse the public on climate change,” Eubanks said. “They were actively denying the impact of human-caused carbon emissions, even when their own research showed otherwise.”


As for the crux of your actual argument: ""The U.S. government has not created for itself environmental liability. It has never said 'Oh shit, the environment is fucked? We have to pay these costs.' And frankly the government never will.""

Also not the case. In fact, there's a term for the damages the public incurs as the result of fossil fuel consumption, called the [Social Cost of Carbon](http://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/EPAactivities/economics/scc.html). So we already have identified and are already paying the costs. 

What you don't seem to have addressed is that the problem isn't that their product produces externalities. It's that they actively engaged in efforts to mislead the public. They knew it was problematic, and told the public the opposite. THAT is the real issue here, which you have completely missed.

California wants renewable energy for half its power by 2030

LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gov. Jerry Brown dramatically increased California's climate-change goals, committing the state to use renewable energy for half its electricity and make existing buildings twice as energy-efficient in just 15 years.

Brown tried for an even stronger measure that also would have enforced a 50 percent drop in petroleum use by 2030, but was defeated by oil interests. He called that a short-term setback, and insisted that the world needs to wean itself off fossil fuels as quickly as possible.

""What has been the source of our prosperity now becomes the source of our ultimate destruction, if we don't get off it. And that is so difficult,"" Brown said at a signing ceremony Wednesday at the hilltop Griffith Observatory, overlooking the haze of downtown Los Angeles.

California already has some of the world's toughest air quality standards, and set a mandate in 2006 to derive a third of its electricity from renewable sources such as solar, wind and geothermal by 2020. State regulators say they already hit 25 percent last year, as huge solar farms sprouted in the desert and towering windmills went up along mountain passes.

""It's monumental,"" said Alex Jackson, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""For an economy the size of California to commit to getting half of its power needs from renewable energy resources, I think, is a game-changer.""

Few question whether the new goal of 50 percent is achievable by 2030, but critics worry that the complex regulations needed to speed the transition from fossil fuels will add unknown costs for consumers and businesses.

Republican state Sen. Jim Nielsen of Gerber predicts more expensive ""energy, food and all things that require abundant affordable energy to produce and transport, particularly hurting those California families least able to afford it.""

Just how California will meet the new goal isn't clear. Brown left the details to the state's Air Resources Board, Energy Commission and Public Utilities Commission. These boards are led mostly by gubernatorial appointees and have broad influence over economic life.

California's utilities favored the measure. They mostly use natural gas, nuclear energy and some coal, but solar, wind, geothermal and biomass are growing sources of electricity, and regulators are expected to allow them to pass some costs of the transition on to consumers.

The new law also encourages utilities to expand by building many more charging stations for electric vehicles, and provides for fines or penalties if utilities don't meet the goals.

Supporters say Californians can keep saving money through rebates and subsidies as they purchase electric vehicles, replace inefficient light bulbs and appliances, and install solar panels or double-paned windows.

Brown, a Democrat, began this year with a vow to push the most aggressive greenhouse-gas emissions benchmark in North America through the Legislature. He took his campaign around the world, even meeting with the pope in July.

But he lost a key political battle among moderate Democrats in Sacramento amid intense lobbying by the oil industry, which financed a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign that raised fears of job losses if cuts in petroleum use were imposed.

Catherine Reheis-Boyd, president of the Western States Petroleum Association, thanked lawmakers who voted against the proposed cap for keeping California competitive.

Some lawmakers were willing to accept forced cuts in petroleum use if the Legislature could have more power over the Air Resources Board, which has been implementing the greenhouse gas emissions law.

But Brown refused to give up what he sees as his executive authority.

Both houses are controlled by Democrats, but on Wednesday, Brown squarely accused Republicans of failing to do enough to reverse global warming. He recalled that Ronald Reagan was California's governor when the state created the Air Resources Board in response to the Los Angeles smog, and that President Richard Nixon signed the Clean Air Act.

""That was a time when Republicans really got it. We hope they are going to come back to the good old days of Reagan and Nixon, when people cared about clean air and clean water,"" he said.

California's new goal builds on landmark legislation signed by Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2006, which laid the groundwork for the first U.S. program to cap and trade emissions, aiming to reduce pollutants to 1990 levels by 2020.

That program, second only to the European Union's in size, enables polluters to buy and sell credits on a market, generating billions in revenues since the state held its first carbon auction in 2012.

Businesses will pay an estimated $2.2 billion in the current budget year to help fund mass transportation including a planned high-speed rail system and pay for appliance rebate programs, building upgrades and forestry and wetland conservation.

Opponents say all this raises costs for consumers, but supporters say initial fears of economic harm have not come true. California's economy is relatively healthy, with an unemployment rate of 6.1 percent in August. That's above the 5.1 percent national average, but the lowest it's been since January 2008.

Pro-guns (mention gun control, watch the NRA talking points emerge), anti-women (mention the wage gap and watch the MRAs react), pro-white (mention affirmative action and watch the ""I'm white and unemployed!"" comments roll in), there are a whole host of issues that reddit tends to be right-of-center on.

And if it's something that's big enough to get a flood of submissions, then at least one of those is sure to rise above the 100 (or realistically, 1,000) vote threshold. 

Because by then either there's a thread with discussion and a few hundred points (because you don't get discussion with only dozens of votes) or there was one that got, say, 30 votes, but no more, and is stuck at number 60 or so on /hot, making it all but invisible. 

And it wouldn't split the conversation, it'd allow for /new lunch-browsers to engage in a new thread instead of having to dig around for the morning's (failed) threads. 

My concern is just that sometimes posts get to 20 or 30 without leaving the new queue or top 50 places on /hot. So a handful of people see it, but not the general /r/politics public.

Emphasis mine: 



Dear Mr. Taylor -

Thank you for the attention you are giving to our research and continuing the discussion about how professional engineers and geoscientists view climate change. We would like to emphasize a few points in order to avoid any confusion about the results.

**First and foremost, our study is not a representative survey.** Although our data set is large and diverse enough for our research questions, it cannot be used for generalizations such as “respondents believe …” or “scientists don’t believe …” Our research reconstructs the frames the members of a professional association hold about the issue and the argumentative patterns and legitimation strategies these professionals use when articulating their assumptions. Our research does not investigate the distribution of these frames and, thus, does not allow for any conclusions in this direction. We do point this out several times in the paper, and it is important to highlight it again.

In addition, even within the confines of our non-representative data set, **the interpretation that a majority of the respondents believe that nature is the primary cause of global warming is simply not correct. To the contrary: the majority believes that humans do have their hands in climate change**, even if many of them believe that humans are not the only cause. What is striking is how little support that the Kyoto Protocol had among our respondents. However, it is also not the case that all frames except “Support Kyoto” are against regulation – the “Regulation Activists” mobilize for a more encompassing and more strongly enforced regulation. Correct interpretations would be, for instance, that – among our respondents – more geoscientists are critical towards regulation (and especially the Kyoto Protocol) than non-geoscientists, or that more people in higher hierarchical positions in the industry oppose regulation than people in lower hierarchical positions.

All frequencies in our paper should only be used to get an idea of the potential influence of these frames – e.g. on policy responses. Surely the insight that those who oppose regulation tend to have more influence on policy-making than the supporters of the Kyoto Protocol should not come as a surprise after Canada dropped out of the protocol a year ago.

But once again: This is not a representative survey and should not be used as such!

We trust that this clarifies our findings. Thank you again for your attention.

Best regards, Lianne Lefsrud and Renate Meyer

And with cash crops, if your harvest gets destroyed (fire/drought/flood/pests) you have nothing. With food crops, you've likely stored what you've been harvesting but haven't eaten yet, and can just plant again and eat the shoots where necessary. 

And it's not the embrace of industrialism so much as it is an honest and reliable system of governance. So countries that are still corrupt but industrialized (i.e. blood diamonds/gold mines) aren't really lifting everyone out of poverty, just enriching the corrupt. 

But yes, by definition development is seen as industrialization. But being a poor family in the city isn't the same quality of life as being a poor family farming your own food in a rural area. ",2015-09-02 20:13:25+00:00,cuoin8t,4.0,t1_cuoifss,312,worldnews

The non-charity related industries bit you mention is probably the fact that trusts/foundations have these huge sums of money, a portion of which they donate out to fund projects. The rest of it is invested in order to grow the holdings, so they can fund more projects.

&gt;When I was Governor, I learned that it doesn't matter that we are right about climate change - what matters is communicating to people who are worried about putting food on the table and surviving to inspire them to join us in calling for a clean energy future. We did that during the campaign to beat Prop 23 (the initiative that would have stopped AB32), and we got the people on our side and won in a landslide at the polls. Of all the ads we ran, the one that had the most impact was the one with the lung association that showed a child struggling to breathe in our central valley because of pollution.

With a revenue-neutral price on carbon we can quickly stimulate exactly the sort of switch that's necessary to slow the ocean's rise, instead of allowing it to take over our coastal cities.

&gt;If this threat were from a foreign nation our response would be unequivocal, immediate and forceful. But because the enemy is us, we have dragged our feet for decades and resisted the necessary changes. Paralyzed by fears propagated by industrial interests, we remain unwilling to change the energy infrastructure that's fueling this problem. By putting a price on carbon and returning that revenue to the people, we can begin to turn back the rising tide that threatens to engulf our coastal communities.

2303,"In 2002, a Koch group registered www.usteaparty.com. Got something that predates that?

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_Party_movement#Background): 

&gt;References to the Boston Tea Party were part of Tax Day protests held in the 1990s and before.[17][18][19][20] In 1984, David H. Koch and Charles G. Koch of Koch Industries founded Citizens for a Sound Economy (CSE), a conservative political group whose self-described mission was ""to fight for less government, lower taxes, and less regulation."" Congressman Ron Paul was appointed as the first chairman of the organization. The CSE lobbied for policies favorable to corporations, particularly tobacco companies.[citation needed]

&gt;In 2002, the first[citation needed] Tea Party movement website was designed and published by the CSE at web address www.usteaparty.com, and stated ""our US Tea Party is a national event, hosted continuously online and open to all Americans who feel our taxes are too high and the tax code is too complicated.""[74][75] The site did not take off at the time.[76] In 2003, Dick Armey became the chairman of CSE after retiring from Congress.[77] In 2004, Citizens for a Sound Economy split into FreedomWorks, for 501c4 advocacy activity, and Americans for Prosperity Foundation. Dick Armey stayed as chairman of FreedomWorks, while David Koch stayed as Chairman of Americans for Prosperity Foundation. The two organizations would become key players in the Tea Party movement from 2009 onward.[78][79] Americans for Prosperity and FreedomWorks were ""probably the leading partners"" in the September, 2009 Taxpayer March on Washington, also known as the ""9/12 Tea Party,"" according to The Guardian.[80]",2015-07-27 20:00:48+00:00,cti50rq,6.0,t1_cti4rff,377,politics

One of the results of psychological research into conservatives and liberals is that conservatives score higher in measurements of group loyalty and authority, meaning that they're more apt to defer to their leaders and community than personal independence.

If you did mean MATS, then it's still not accurate since this ruling just kicked the suit back down to the DC court to make the EPA consider costs now instead of later when designing the enforcement. Doesn't throw out the MATS rule, just says the EPA has to take costs into account. DC court may throw out the rule, but since it upheld the rule last time it's not likely to toss it now, but instead will probably just tell the EPA to go count costs, thereby just delaying enforcement.

There are a number of fairly straightforward explainers from what should be credible sources- The A[merican Association for the Advancement of Science](http://whatweknow.aaas.org/), the group that puts out the #1 peer-reviewed journal, Science and is one of the oldest and most prestigious academic institutions ever is a good place to start. Then there's the [National Climate Assessment](http://nca2014.globalchange.gov/), which uses information and scientists from the various government scientific agencies, and was started by Bush to explain the state of climate science.  Then [there's the IPCC](http://ipcc.ch/), which is the international look at the state of the science, and has been approved by delegates from every country (including petrostates like Saudi Arabia. So even Saudis agree that what's there is the truth.) ",2015-06-18 20:51:14+00:00,csb52hi,2.0,t1_csb4mkt,661,politics
