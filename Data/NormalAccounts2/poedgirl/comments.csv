On a related note, I really wish developers would stop claiming their apps are DPI Aware when they're clearly not (cough: Adobe). They are completely unusable on a 4K screen when the UI is so small.

There is a way for you to overcome the issue yourself though, but it requires some tinkering. First, you need to set a registry value to tell Windows to prefer external manifest files. 

To do this, open up regedit and go to:

&gt;  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE &gt; SOFTWARE &gt; Microsoft &gt; Windows &gt; CurrentVersion &gt; SideBySide. 

Create a DWORD (32 bit) value called ""PreferExternalManifest"" and set the value to 1.

You'll then need to create a manifest file for the application you want to mark as DPI Aware. To do this, paste the following into a text file and call it app.exe.manifest (replacing app.exe with the app name) and place it along side the app exe file (for example, Steam.exe.manifest in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam).

    &lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;
    &lt;asmv1:assembly manifestVersion=""1.0"" xmlns=""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1"" xmlns:asmv1=""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1"" xmlns:asmv2=""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v2"" xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance""&gt;
      &lt;assemblyIdentity version=""1.0.0.0"" name=""MyApplication.app""/&gt;
      &lt;trustInfo xmlns=""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v2""&gt;
        &lt;security&gt;
          &lt;requestedPrivileges xmlns=""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v3""&gt;
            &lt;requestedExecutionLevel level=""asInvoker"" uiAccess=""false"" /&gt;
          &lt;/requestedPrivileges&gt;
        &lt;/security&gt;
      &lt;/trustInfo&gt;
    
      &lt;application  xmlns=""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v3""&gt;
        &lt;windowsSettings&gt;
          &lt;dpiAware  xmlns=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/SMI/2005/WindowsSettings""&gt;true&lt;/dpiAware&gt;
        &lt;/windowsSettings&gt;
      &lt;/application&gt;
      
      &lt;!-- Enable themes for Windows common controls and dialogs (Windows XP and later) --&gt;
      &lt;dependency&gt;
        &lt;dependentAssembly&gt;
          &lt;assemblyIdentity
              type=""win32""
              name=""Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls""
              version=""6.0.0.0""
              processorArchitecture=""*""
              publicKeyToken=""6595b64144ccf1df""
              language=""*""
            /&gt;
        &lt;/dependentAssembly&gt;
      &lt;/dependency&gt;
    
    &lt;/asmv1:assembly&gt;
The key thing here is the dpiAware key.

Then re-launch the app and it should no longer be blurry, it may, however not scale things correctly.

&gt;Thus privileging or assisting particular
people in relevant ways is not arbitrary but
an entirely fair response. And if the union of
a man and a woman is different from other
unions – not the same as other unions – then
justice demands that we treat that union
accordingly. If marriage is an institution
designed to support people of the opposite
sex to be faithful to each other and to the
children of their union it is not discrimination
to reserve it to them.
