I decided to make a very simple webpage that will tell them exactly when in their local timezone. Thought it could help some people here on Reddit.

I found quite a few gems in there including really funny dialog from civilians along with some indications that civilians change what they say to you after doing certain story missions.   

The one thing I'm sure everyone will enjoy, however, is this one: https://soundcloud.com/poedgirl/they-got-alex  

I found 3 names that they call out when you kill an AI: Mitchell, Leeroy and Alex (Leeroy is also on that SoundCloud).

Edit:  
I've put them on my CDN for all to enjoy:
