69,"My (now) wife used to work as an EMG/EEG technician in a hospital in Riyadh. Here are some stories:

During her time there, apparently a pretty hospital worker (a nurse, I think) was left by the hospital service at a market.  Took a cab to get to housing. Taxi driver brought her to a desert-y place to rape her.  A security guard also raped her.  Was paid a hefty sum to keep mouth shut.  News didn't reach PH.

The guards at the hospital were also huge pervs.

Males in their (di ko alam kung anong tawag) clothes (robes?) like to parade their boners in front of female hospital workers daw. They don't wear underwear kaya sobrang evident.

Isa pa, and I don't know if it's relevant. Most married workers daw, when they go abroad have this belief of ""iniiwan ang wedding ring sa pinas.""  Ginagawa nilang excuse yung sobrang lungkot para makagawa ng kalokohan.  My (then) GF had a lot of suitors, all married. Yun ang reason nila. Sa Pilipinas lang naman daw sila kasal.
