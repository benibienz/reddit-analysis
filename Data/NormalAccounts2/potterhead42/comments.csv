30,"&gt;Stick: I am beyond pleased that I'm not the only one who thought that the scene where Shallan tries to soulcast a stick was absolutely hilarious.

Absolutely agreed on that stick thing. It was even better in the audiobook because of how well the narrator nailed the stick's self satisfied smug tone. 

&gt;So I've already read quite a bit of people complaining that Shallan's supposed 'wit' is cringy and annoying. I didn't find it that bad, most of the time.

One explanation someone gave, that I really liked, is that Shallan thinks she's super witty and funny because everyone just tells her that. I mean, in a super gloomy house if you're the only person making the slightest attempts at humor, then of course people think you're great. Thankfully apart from her lame humor, she's a pretty good character overall.

&gt;Kaladin/Shallan character dynamic at the beginning

Yeah, Kaladin doesn't strike me as the type to trade petty insults. He'd either just ignore her, or do something more substantial. That said, their first scene was totally hilarious. BOOTS!

&gt;Last Chapter/Epilogue revelations

The only one that felt abrupt to me was that Renarin is a Radiant. Jasnah being alive was something I was actually assuming from the very start. 

&gt;Syl's return / Kaladin's oaths

Agreed. Although it was a bit spoiled by the Stormfather telling Dalinar beforehand that one of his daughters was misbehaving or something.

So I am improving, but really slowly. (800 to 1800 in a year). Maybe if I reallly try harded I might be 2.5k, or even 3k. So what?

Brackets is also right, but it's the general purpose term for multiple things : 

* () - parentheses, or round brackets

* {} - curly brackets, or **braces**

* [] - square brackets.

Further,

&gt;In C, C++, Java and other C-derived languages—as well as in Scheme-influenced languages that have adopted C/Java syntax, such as JavaScript—the ""{}"" symbols are referred to as ""braces"" or ""curly braces"" and never as brackets.

I concluded a re-listen of the LoTR trilogy, and I was rather surprised at how small the books are, compared to what we're used to nowaday. But also I was able to appreciate the depth of the lore and worldbuilding and the writing way better than when I first read it in high school. Now I'm thinking I might read the Silmarillion after all. 

Also I've been playing a lot of Witcher 3, and damn that's a great game. Apart from the regular good stuff like huge open world, great visuals etc., what really sets it apart for me are the side quests. They're all interesting and worthwhile in themselves, with a little bit of intriguing plot attached to all of them. Which means the entire game is fun, there's no feeling of ""grinding"". If anyone has still not played it, do it!

Life wise, working out is still going strong. I finally coughed up for a personal trainer, which is quite expensive, but the extra motivation he gives means I put in about twice as much effort as I would have on my own. Still a long way to go before I'm anywhere near being in shape though.

378,"Spoilers for book 1 and Deadhouse Gates to Chapter 1| More info and previous posts  |Please no spoilers for future books/events

In my plan to read The Malazan Book of The Fallen, I’m now on book 2, Deadhouse Gates. This post covers chapter 1.

Prologue

I expected to be in like 2000 BS (Before Sleep), so it’s pretty nice to see we’re still in the “present”. Not nice to see is this guy:

Honoring his god on this day, the servant of Hood, Lord of Death, had joined his companions in stripping naked and smearing himself in the blood of executed murderers, blood that was stored in giant amphorae lining the walls of the temple’s nave. The brothers had then moved in procession out onto the streets of Unta to greet the god’s sprites, enjoining the mortal dance that marked the Season of Rot’s last day.

Ew. Ew. Ewww. Is Hood the god of death or of Ew?

Watching this monstrosity come her way is Felisin, who I remember is Paran’s sis. I’m a bit surprised by this since she didn’t have much of a role in the last book, I guess it’s just a memorable name. She’s in a bad way, no doubt part of the Malazan anti-nobles thing.

The priest ends up coming to the priest of Fener beside her, and the flies proceed to talk and suddenly, the flies fly off, and it turns out there’s no man underneath. Cue my first WTF of the book.

Felisin chats a bit with another noble lady, and we find out that her sis Tavore is the new Adjunct (RIP Lorn). Sucks for Felisin, but it does make a brutal sort of sense to renounce your noble house when it’s clear that it’s only going to get one into trouble. She also makes sort-of friends with a thug Baudin and a priest/historian called Heboric. Then it’s time for them to go get bloodied an angry mob of peasants. And it is pretty brutal even though we’ve been warned it’s coming. Baudin though is not cowed, he fights right back, killing people left and right. I’m surprised the guards don’t interfere, don’t try to stop him. Finally he kills the noble woman, sawing her head off and throwing it to the crowd to scare/appease them. And then they’re put on a slave ship.

Well. That was quite the gory prologue.

Chapter One

Icarium and Mappo, last heard of giving weird clocks to Darujhistan, are hanging out in the Pan’potsun Odhan desert. You know how Erikson comes up with some totally rad made up names? Yeah, “Pan’potsun Odhan” is not one of those.

They chat about some inscrutable stuff regarding an upcoming Convergence, as people do in the series. How do they know about a convergence months in advance? Do all gods etc. set up a schedule in advance? Then something Mappo says catches my eye.

Shy as a hare is Mappo Trell.

I’m probably way off the mark, but this reminds me of the way Kruppe speaks and now I have this weird theory that Kruppe is part Trell. Probably wrong, but better put this here in case I turn out to be right.

Apparently others are also seeking what they seek, and Mappo is worried. Icarium is not, he just wants his memories back. Amnesia? Really? Is this a ’90s soap opera?

A pack of wolves approach them, it seems they are all controlled by the same consciousness, which they call a D’ivers. Parallel computing FTW! I’m mentally prepping for a fight, but the two parties just chat a bit, and part amicably enough.

Next up is a brand new POV character, Duiker, the imperial historian, with an evil priest, waiting to meet up with the new Fist of the Seventh, Coltaine. Being a historian, Duiker obligingly gives us a backstory of the guy. Basically he’s a local who once led the Wickans against the Empire before Kellanved stopped him, and now they’ve recruited him to quell the brewing rebellion. I can’t quite decide whether this is a genius move or a stupid one. Time will tell.

Fiddler and Friends are in a boat, bound for Ehrlitan, which is also on the Seven Cities continent. Fiddler is pretty grumpy, since he’s seasick. Can anyone who’s actually been seasick tell me, is it really so bad? Every book with a seasick character makes it sound like the worst thing ever, 24×7 puking and aches and stuff. They mention flying fish, who jump on whales and eat them up. I fail to see why they have to be flying fish to do this though. But before I can get creeped out by murderous flying fish, Fiddler drops this:

“Think of a centipede eighty paces long,” Fiddler answered. “Wraps up whales and ships alike, blows out all the air under its armored skin and sinks like a stone, taking its prey with it.”

What is with this book and horror movie-esque imagery? Did Erikson spend the time between GoTM and DG thinking up scary/creepy wildlife for the Malazan world? BTW, What do you even call this world, since Malazan is just a part of it?

They’re just saying how these Dhenrabi don’t occur around here, when one breaks the surface. And not just a normal one, a Soletaken/Shapeshifter. Why do they call Shapeshifters Soletaken? Does one have to sacrifice their soul or something to gain this ability? Anyway, the monster is kind enough to telepathically inform them that the only reason he must kill them is they saw him. Um, what? Dude if you’d just stayed underwater they wouldn’t have seen you.

Without missing a beat, Fiddler loads up his crossbow and fires at the thing, and blows its head to bits. That was… easy. I expected a desperate escape or unexpected help or something, but Fiddler just took it out like it was a regular centipede.  I guess this was supposed to make us feel that Fiddler is badass, but all I can think is, too easy.

Then they get right back to chatting. Crokus has realised that Fiddler and Kalam are not just there to escort Apsalar home, but have their own agenda, and demands to know what. The answer? Kalam is out to take out Laseen. Holy shit I am immediately hyped for 1v1 Kalam vs. Laseen, because she was the Claw commander in her time too, wasn’t she? And Quick Ben is their ace in the hole, he’s not here now but can come help Kalam anytime anywhere. Cool.  Although I don’t see why Fiddler is with them for that. Same goes for Apsalar and Crokus.

Well, that’s probably the tiniest post I’ve ever posted, and simultaneously the one that took the most days to write. I normally wouldn’t publish it, but a few people have been making noises about how damnably late I am already, and this is a peace offering of sorts.

You see, real life has, rather rudely, interrupted my leisure days with a new job. And so I find out, like numberless college kids before me, that a full time doesn’t really leave much time for reading, much less posting about said reading. I way looking forward to finishing this post off last weekend, but a touch of fever and cold put those plans to bed, along with me.

But I’ve got my schedule figured out a bit better now, and so the next post will hopefully be earlier than (OMG it’s been three weeks since the last one WTF) three weeks.

Now to talk about the actual reading. Not much to talk about since it’s just the prologue and chapter one, but I’ll say that I’m finding DG way more to my liking, so far. (And I’ve read upto the end of part one, Raraku). The Icarium business, as it involves weird supernatural stuff, is still damn mysterious, but the rest of the plot I almost have a handle on. Looking forward to see how Laseen deals with these multiple rebellions – though we did get a hint, with the cull. Still no sight of Whiskeyjack and co., which sucks since I was pretty eager to find out more about the Pannion Seer.

Ah, so the empire's name is already in the right form. The empire of Malaz, and the people of Malaz, both Malazan. Makes sense. 

&gt;I usually call them Part 1, Part 2, etc.

From now on I will too.

&gt;The finnest was powering the enchantments on the barrow?

Sound reasonable to me. I don't know enough about stuff to judge for myself, but it's better than no explanation. 

&gt;The good news is, ""What the heck is an Azath?"" is one of the major plots of the entire series, it's not going to get swept under the rug. I think Erikson wanted to introduce it in a way that made the reader invested in learning about them. Having it be the solution to the main conflict with no explanation just leaves a bad taste though.

Well that's good enough for me I guess. And yeah, I do see how this dramatic introduction would me make me pay more attention the next time Azaths are mentioned. 

&gt;This was set up earlier on in the book. Rake and Brood basically split on the Oponn issue. Rake really doesn't like them and sent people to kill Crokus to try and force Oponn into the open so he can deal with them. Brood thinks such a confrontation on top of everything else happening is going to end with Darujhistan in ruins and sends some Crimson Guard out to keep Crokus protected. I know there's a bit at the end where Rake confronts Crokus and mentions that Brood convinced him to change his mind.

Yeah, I went back and read that part after someone else mentioned it, and it is all there. I just 100% missed it the first time around. 

&gt;Erikson switches to 4 parts for the future books (except the final book).

Yeah, I was thinking that 7 is just too many for such a small book. And I'm totally okay with splitting parts across posts, it just so happened that this books' parts were just the right size for a post. ",2016-07-07 00:43:37+00:00,d526p8v,2.0,t1_d51st7e,18719.0,Fantasy

It's still good, but just doesn't have the same gripping, page-turner quality like his earlier books. **3/5**

* **The Crown Tower**, by Michael J. Sullivan. Another bingo book, this one for the AMA author square. I've read the Riyria Revelations, so it was nice to meet Royce and Hadrian again, and I really liked the feel of the book. The meeting of Royce and Hadrian was pretty fun, and the Gwen storyline was remarkably absorbing, given that it's just a bunch of women setting up a brothel. That said, it felt just a bit too short and.. insubstantial. I guess it's because it's just one book rather than part of a bigger plot, and we already know chunks of the story from Riyria Revelations. **4/5**

* **Superman: Red Son** by Mark Millar, for the Graphic Novel square. Pretty interesting, though rather low on any actual superhero action, and the ending wasn't really believable for me, but overall worth the time. I especially liked the cameo from Russian batman. **4/5**

* **Great North Road**, by Peter F. Hamilton, for the SciFi square. Hamilton's one of my favorite SF writers, and the sheer size of his books is one of the reasons. But even considering that, the book felt way too long. It had some pretty good plot mysteries and worlbuilding, but takes waaay too long - about 500 pages to get to the good stuff, which meant I spent the equivalent of a huge novel reading boring police procedures.  So even though I ended up enjoying it by the end, I had to dock points for the boring bits. If only he'd cut off 25% or so, it would have been so much better. **3/5**

* **Calamity**, by Brandon Sanderson, for the YA square. It had all the things that made me like Steelheart, but the overall wrap up of the plot was not that satisfying, which was quite an unpleasant surprise for me, seeing as it was a Sanderson book. [spoilers](#s ""Calamity being this random epic from ""elsewhere"" really ruined it for me. Like, it would have been fine if it were just an inexplicable natural event. IMO he should've focused more on making epics push back the darkness and face their fears and stuff, instead of lamely convincing Calamity to go away and everything is conveniently fine."") **3/5**

* **The Builders**, by Daniel Polansky, another bingo book. Apart from having the characters be animals, it was pretty much a by the numbers revenge story. Plus having like two page chapters felt rather annoying. Good writing though. **3/5**

* **Spell or High Water**, by Scott Meyer, for the Flying Protagonist square. I enjoyed book one of the series, and book two was even funnier. There was a lot of time-travel related fun, which I really liked. Only issue I had is that a lot of the book focuses instead on a side plot that I really did not like, because the character in those parts was (by design) annoying as hell. But still great light-hearted fun book. **4/5**

This month, I've finally started on **The Fifth Season**, by N.K. Jemisin. The writing style is weird, but in a good way. The worldbuilding feels a bit sparse, but the stuff that is revealed so far is pretty great and intriguing. Can't wait to find out more about stone eaters and the obelisks. One thing I don't get is what's up with her talking in the second person for one of the POV characters. ""You realise you are crying"", ""You fill a bottle of water"". It feels pointlessly weird.

* A [chart](http://i.imgur.com/k66uZ9Q.png) of vote vs. rank. Comparing this to last year's [chart](http://i.imgur.com/KDzFn0T.png), it does seem that the extra votes have made it less steep. And a [pie chart](http://i.imgur.com/SGpi5Wh.png) of the top ten, with [last year's](http://i.imgur.com/GGCJ6jL.png) for comparison.

* Harry Potter has climbed a lot, for which I'm *very* happy, and also for Mistborn making the top ten as well. Thanks to all her most popular works being combined, Robin Hobb makes her debut in the top ten as well. On the downside, no Wheel of Time in there :(

* Despite no new books coming out, both Kingkiller Chronicles and ASOIAF remain strongly in the lead. 

* **3223** votes were cast across **496** series, compared to 1741/249 for last year, thanks to everyone getting ten votes this year - though that didn't stop people complaining that it's too hard to choose. This is also why it took so much time for the results this year, sorry for the delay folks.

* Unlike last year, I decided not to include a column for change in rank, because the new way we combine series means that a lot of the older entries have disappeared and new ones appeared, so it really wouldn't have much significance. Here's the list for [2015](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/30h21n/the_2015_top_rfantasy_novels_of_all_time_poll/) and [2014](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ynqcm/the_top_rfantasy_novels_of_all_time_results_thread/) if you want to compare.

* /u/ThunderfuckTheViking had the best username among the voters by a large margin.

He's got jack shit against someone like NP - all three of his normal spells are useless, and if he ults just to catch a single Nature's Prophet, then that's also a win, because the next three minutes you can be aggressive without fear. 

Just don't let him have big 5v5 fights, that's what warlock strives on. 

Also, antoher strategy is try to take the game late. The golems are food for any decently farmed carry into the very lategame (lvl 22+), so he's not that problematic, though the ult is still pretty dangerous, esp with refresher. 

Another option is to focus him down before a fight breaks. Gank him, or even silence him and he's useless, because Warlock rarely has a way to remove silence, and has no escapes at all. ",2016-04-04 05:51:30+00:00,d1p1l12,1.0,t3_4d4u6w,92615.0,learndota2

2. Omniknight. Wanted to help in duels against the LC even if I'm not around, turned out we didn't need it because it was a total stomp. 

3. Shadow Shaman. Aghs is actually pretty damn good on him, and  if I hadn't bought Aghs, we'd have lost for sure, because I had to take basically all the objectives (had 8.7k tower damage at the end), because my team just refused to push properly. 

4. Dazzle. BTW yeah, there is a fourth support game. You really should pay more attention before commenting. Anyway, if you look at the yasp page https://yasp.co/matches/2226407974/purchases, you'll find I also bought plenty of wards and smokes, so it's not like  I picked dazzle and just afk farmed like a carry. And I didn't get medallion because I'm just not good at using actives in fights (partly why I'm in Normal Skill), and I could afford the aghs easily as we were winning. 


And anyways, yeah, I am not the type of sacrificial support player who picks support into a 4 carry lineup and then spend the game playing with just wand and boots. I get the normal support stuff like courier and warding, but if I can farm up the bigger items, I don't see what the problem is.

865,"Well I went from 800 to 1600, and I think at our level the two most important things are to not stand around and to focus on objectives.

By the first I mean that often I see people just walking around the map not really doing anything, or the mid faceoff where both teams just stare at each other across the river. You should always either be fighting, pushing, or farming. Always. Every moment you're just standing there is decreasing your GPM and XPM and delaying your items.

And focusing on taking objectives is equally important. The game is not about getting kills and winning fights, it's about destroying the ancient. So if you don't translate a won fight into roshan/tower/rax, then that's a huge wasted opportunity. If you don't push while ahead, you're only giving the opponents time to farm and catch up. 

Plus, just blaming your team is never helpful. If they're doing something wrong, you should try telling them. And not like ""RETARDS BUY FUCKING DUST FOR RIKI!"", that's just counterproductive. Be nice and polite.

912,"This was the final month for the bingo challenge, so there was a lot of frantic reading. I got through plenty of books:

* **The Traitor Baru Cormorant**, Seth Dickinson. Enjoyed the new approach and ideas, but saw the big twist ending coming a mile away, and the writing definitely needed some polishing. But I'll certainly pick up a sequel, partly because the ending gave no closure at all. **3/5**

* **Off To Be The Wizard**, Scott Meyer. This was okay. I liked the humor, which gave me plenty of chuckles, and the lighthearted tone of the book, but the plot wasn't really much to talk about. It was like eating candyfloss, fun in the moment, but nothing memorable. **3/5**

* **Rogues**, GRRM. I picked five random shorts from the anthology for the short stories bingo square, and honestly I wasn't too impressed. Nothing *wrong* with the tales, it's just that a short story doesn't allow for the sort of worldbuilding and plotting that makes fantasy tick for me. **3/5**

* **My Life As A White Trash Zombie**, Diana Rowland. This one was a surprise. I picked almost at random for the urban fantasy square, but the plucky narrator got me pretty invested in the book. Also, the narration for the audiobook was really well done, though the accent took a bit of getting used to. Maybe I'll check out more from the series eventually. **4/5**

* **In The Court of King Arthur**, Samuel E. Lowe. Meh. Did not enjoy this at all, only good thing was that it was mercifully short. **2/5**

* **Prince of Fools**, Mark Lawrence. I had really high hopes for this one, as I loved the Broken Empire Trilogy. On the good side, the writing and dialogues are delightful as always. On the other hand, Jalan is nowhere near as strong a protagonist as Jorg. I get that Lawrence wanted to do something different, but the end result is that the new protagonist just didn't grab me like Jorg did. And Snorri, though likable, was pretty boring as a character. All in all, I was kinda disappointed. But I liked it enough that I will eventually read the Liar's Key before giving up. **3/5**


* **Orconomics: A Satire**, J. Zachary Pike. Surprisingly good book, I enjoyed the eponymous satire on the whole ""quest"" trope, and the plot had some nice twists. Looking forwards to the sequel. [Full review on my blog](https://theadventuresofabookworm.wordpress.com/2016/03/30/38-orconomics-a-satire-by-j-zachary-pike/). **3.5/5**

*****

I also started **Forging Divinity**, but the book didn't really get me hooked, so it's kinda on hold for now. 

Also, finally started **The Crown Tower**, which I'd been meaning to get to for ages. Liking it plenty so far. 

Also, I had to read A LOT of standalones to make the bingo challenge, and now I've got a real itch for a big fat epic bazillion page series. Hopefully Malazan will take care of that once I begin my new Big Read. ",2016-03-31 07:59:01+00:00,d1k6zfq,1.0,t3_4coyo9,3093.0,Fantasy

Also, as an Indian from India, I find it kinda funny that American natives are called Indians. 

In more mundane matters, I'm kinda enjoying White Trash Zombie. It's a zombie book, so there's the typical brain eating stuff, but what's fun for me is the narrator, Angel. She's white trash, but she knows is, and yet there's good stuff about her too, and an undertone of self-deprecating humor that I like.

1025,"Actually it's not that bad, basically the issue is that the language wasn't really ""designed"" - there was no comitte that decided what makes sense and is consistent with the language's paradigms, instead it just sort of grew during the dot com boom. It was easy to use at  the time for regular joes getting into the web, and so became incredible popular. But it wasn't as well designed as your other regular languages, and the functions and operators often do unexpected things, which is annoying and makes debugging messy. For example, `NULL &lt; -1`, and `NULL == 0`, which just seems crazy. For more examples, you can check out https://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/

There's also an element of bandwagoning and snobbery, to be honest. The language is not the polished one out there, but there's a reason it became so popular. It was the easiest way to work on the web at the time, because most regular languages didn't have the tools to make things easy, and it has grown over time to include modern concepts.

So, I get all the raving about the book, because it does take a fresh approach, but the ending just left me feeling a bit meh.

The fact that the rebellion was fake was obvious to me from early on, with that guy she met, and talk of them having a favorite method, letting prisoners think they've escaped etc. So I expected the rebellion arc to wrap up fast, and we get to her taking down the Empire from within. What happened instead was that the rebellion took up the whole book. Which left me feeling a bit cheated, to be honest."")

Also, the writing. It just felt confusing to me, both in the way it the book was written, and the sheer number of people and things and places the narration touches on.

* **The Last Unicorn**, by Peter S. Beagle. This one is obviously pretty famous and well liked. Unfortunately, I just didn't enjoy it. The book had its moments, but on the whole the feeling and atmosphere the author was going for didn't click with me. I can't point to specific flaws even. I guess it wasn't for me. **2/5**

* **Halloween Jack and the Devil's Gate**, by u/mgallogwlas. This was strictly average for me. On the one hand, I liked the writing and the characters, but on the other hand just couldn't accept someone terrorising the immortal demons of hell with a stupid stick and lantern of all things!

Right now I'm reading The Traitor Baru Cormorant, which took some getting used to with all the name dropping, but once I accepted I was never going to remember all the dukes and places and empires and whatnots, I enjoyed the very different way this book approaches both conquest and betrayal. Currently halfway through, and a bit perplexed at Baru's actions. 

I'm also listening to Off To Be The Wizard, by Scott Meyer. This one I enjoyed from the start. It's well though out in terms of plot, and the humor is pretty good too.

I'm all for well defined, rule-based ones, but the book makes a deliberate choice to move away from that, and it works. They try to teach Agnieszka the rigid, rule based magic, but it just doesn't work for her. Which is also why it always seems she has special magic powers. 

As for the plot, I thought it was pretty straightforwards. 

Yeah, Agnieszka is a bit of a Mary Sue, but that's part of the fairy tale feel, and anyway, it's not a bad thing IMO. Not every character has to be a Tyrion or a Ninefingers.

The book is pretty different from a lot of popular fantasy today, but while you think it's bad different, I think it's good different. ",2016-02-28 19:00:43+00:00,d0h4hwr,2.0,t1_d0h45s2,531.0,Fantasy

I went in expecting to not enjoy it - I mean, it's Snow White. You already know the plot. Imagine my surprise when it totally blew me away!

I'm the sort of reader who doesn't really believe in ""beautiful"" prose, and see the text as a medium to tell the story. But this novella's writing was undeniably beautiful. Snow White's first person POV had some really striking thoughts and phrases too, and combined with the wild-west feel, it really hooked me. 

Unfortunately halfway through the book switched to third person narration, which kinda bummed me. The second half sort of spiraled out of control, weirdness-wise, and by the ending nothing was making much sense. But I still ended up enjoying it, weirdly enough. 

This is just the sort of thing for which I signed up for the bingo challenge - reading things that I wouldn't normally, but surprisingly end up enjoying. So thanks /u/lrich1024!

The scene started funny/embarassing, but then Steris really let her worries and concerns through and the two of them had a pretty nice and long chat. 

I thought it was really great.

&gt; “And all I am to this arrangement is a title,” Wax said. “It goes both ways.”

&gt; 
&gt; “What every proper lady needs in a man.” 
&gt; 
&gt; “Murdering is very traditional. Goes all the way back.” 
&gt; 
&gt; Wax smiled. “Actually, if you want to be strictly traditional—going back to the Imperial Pair—it was the lady in the relationship who did the murdering.”

They started out as this awkward couple who are nice to each other but aren't really in love, evidenced by the panic Wax felt at the marriage.

1223,"This is a great idea! Here we go. 

I was born 10 years after /u/MikeOfThePalace and got into fantasy with the Harry Potter wave. It was my first ""series"" and I didn't even know it was fantasy at that time, just that it was (and still is) the best stuff I ever read.

It would take a couple more years to realise that there's such a thing as genres and Fantasy is one of them, and that in fact it's my favorite. 

For a great series, I'm basically looking for cool stuff. Cool battles, fights, people, magic, world, monsters, whatever. I don't have anything for or against grimdark. I like my prose simple - I want to sort of ignore it and get into the world and the story itself. 

If I had to choose between characters and plot, I'd choose the latter in general. I'm okay with books with forgettable characters and memorable stories, but not the other way around. Mistborn is a good example. Of course I appreciate it when a series has both, like The Wheel of Time. 

Sub genre wise, I've generally struck to epic fantasy. I don't have anything against urban per se, but it just doesn't feel as fantastic to me as epic fantasy set in entire new worlds. Plus most popular urban fantasy seems to be a bunch of distinct novels that happen to have the same protagonists/setting. I prefer series that have one big story that spans books, instead of ones whose books are mostly standalone. That feeling you get at the culmination of events that started thousands of pages ago is just amazing. 

I like things to be neat and clear. Mysteries and hints are fine so long as they are resolved properly. I love explanations and rules, and rule based magic systems. 

Still, all of this is just what I think I like in an abstract way. When I think of series that I loved though, there's plenty of exceptions. 

Enough blabbering. Let's have some examples:

Stuff I loved :

* Harry Potter.

* Anything by Brandon Sanderson, notably the original Mistborn trilogy. 

* The Wheel of Time. 

* The Lord of The Rings. 

* The Dark Tower. 

* The Stand. 

* The First Law Trilogy. 

* The Broken Empire Trilogy.

* The Bartimaeus series. 

* Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. 

* Eragon.

Popular stuff that I tried but didn't enjoy much:

* American Gods. 

* The Hunger Games. 

* The Night Anger Trilogy. 

* Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell. 

* Discworld. Note: I read only the first book, and I intend to give it another shot one of these days. 

tl;dr : Like simple prose and cool rule based magics and nicely planned plots with foreshadowing, not a big fan or urban/romance, Harry Potter is the best. ",2016-01-24 18:38:43+00:00,cza82by,1.0,t3_4204jm,275050.0,Fantasy

 This also covered my historical fantasy bingo square. 


* **Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell** by Susanna Clarke : I liked the writing and the tone of the book - the dry humour, the Englishness and so on, but that was just about it. The plot itself felt rather bland to me, the pace too slow, and even the parts that I could see were supposed to be ""exciting"" weren't much. I think it was just way longer than it should have been. At 300 or so pages, it'd have been fun, but as it is, I was almost bored to tears by the end. **3/5**

 This took care of the ""Novel by an Author on r/Fantasy's women in fantasy list"" square. 

* **The Way of Shadows** by Brent Weeks : This was a total bust. I went in expecting badass assassins and stuff, but that was mostly tell not show. Instead we spend the novel with the protagonist worrying about what his friends and his crush think of him and so on. It was a deubt novel too, and it shows. The writing and the pacing felt rough and uneven, and most of the characters were rather flat. Will not be continuing the series. **2/5**

 Did this for the debut novel bingo square.

* **Shadows of Self** by Brandon Sanderson : Sanderson. Mistborn. What more is there to say? Great book, full of the things that I love Sanderson for - plot twists, action scenes, fights, cool magic stuff. **4/5** [Longer review \(spoilers\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/3ynu65/just_finished_shadows_of_self_spoilers/)

As AM, you're particularly susceptible because if she initiates and duels you, there's not much you can do. So warding and playing a bit defensive is very important, not to mention map awareness.

So basically Harry and Hermione are their favorites, and they want them to end up together. Personally, I'm kind of in that camp as well. I'm not against Ron ending Hermione, but I'd have loved if she ended up with Harry instead. 

On an unrelated note, I sometimes feel that Ron and Harry's friendship might not have survived that. I mean, Ron always sorta resented Harry his popularity and fame, and if he even ""got the girl"" it might be too much for him.

1344,"Some Observations:

* ""Nice bird, asshole!""

* In terms of sheer number of entries, this was my biggest list yet, with 1474 votes across 486(!) characters. I've spent the best part of two days counting and trying to ensure there are no errors, but if you still find any, please tell me. 

* Despite the grimdark crowd doing their best to write the grimmest and darkest characters, they're clearly not doing enough because Logen, Jorg and Glokta are in the top ten.

* There's exactly one gal in the top ten - Arya Stark. So maybe we nerds don't appreciate good female characters.

* George R.R. Martin had the most entries, with ASOIAF bagging a total of 130 votes across 24 characters. However, Brandon Sanderson had the most votes across characters among authors - 141.

* Hermione Granger was the most popular Harry Potter Character, and the most popular WoT character was, of course, Mat. Though even Umbridge and Cadsuane got some votes. Hermione was also the most popular character written by a female author.

* Discworld's DEATH was the most popular non-human character. (I think)

* Epic fantasy apparently makes for more memorable characters - the only Urban fantasy entry in the top 20 is Jim Butcher's Harry Dresden. 

* There was a lot more grumbling about the five limit than in the top novels poll, so apparently people find it harder to name their top five favorite characters than series/novels. 

* A big thanks to the /r/Fantasy mod team for sticking (stickying?) the voting thread.

I mean, Idris Elba looks a bit too buff - my mental image of Roland is someone a bit more gaunt and thin. But he can always work on that.

1467,"&gt; Apparently, once broken, the connection wasn't reestablished when Rand rewrote the timeline by balefiring the last twenty minutes of Rahvin's life into stardust.

Which feels weird to me, because Balefire is supposed to erase all that from the pattern altogether. How does the damn Horn even know Mat died then?

Which leads me to wonder exactly where the Horn came from? Is it just a *ter'angreal*?

&gt;I almost like to read about Moghedien just because she's got such a high opinion of her self despite being so completely ineffectual.

Yeah, both of her POVs were like ""Oh yeah, excellent, this is totally for my own good, I'm going to come out on top at last"" and then she fails totally. 

&gt;It could look so unimaginably cool.

That's the problem! There's so much amazing stuff that trying to do justice to it all would probably bankrupt the makers. I mean, ASOIAF doesn't even have much in the way of supernatural stuff - it's more politics, and still GoT is damn expensive to make. 

&gt; That mounting dread

There wasn't much of that for me - I mean, immediately after that Perrin snaps her neck, so you don't really get time to be horrified. It is pretty scary in hindsight. Lanfear came so close to screwing up everything. 

&gt;Seeing Tam on the verge of a breakdown here, on the other hand, was hard.

Someone should tell him that his son is alive and well, and lighting pipes by thinking about it. 

&gt;No concrete explanation exists.

1473,"&gt;Neither RJ nor Brandon has ever confirmed it, but it's hard to imagine that voice is anyone other than the Creator.

Indeed. But what does it tell us about Rand going ALL CAPS? Is he like, more than a normal human now? Which would also sort of explain the body switching and pipe lighting shenanigans.

&gt;I am not a fan of that. 

I can understand your point, but I thought there'd been plenty of death already - Egwene, Siuan, Bryne, Gawyn... And I love to imagine Lan reclaiming Malkier at long last from the Blight. 

&gt;The fact that it's implied that Rand resurrected him somehow is a complication I still don't know how to feel about.

I just assumed that they left him for dead and he wasn't actually dead. I mean, same thing happened with Gawyn and Galad. And if Rand could resurrect people, I don't think he'd stop at just Lan. 

&gt; Word of Jordan is that he was almost dead at Rhuidean, but not quite. What broke the link was when Rahvin killed him D-E-D dead in Caemlyn, and Rand was able to save him and Avi

In one way, that makes more sense than Rhuidean.

But in another way, that goes counter everything about Balefire. When Rand Balefired Rahvin, it changed the Pattern so that Mat had *never died.* The Horn should still be bound to him. And so does that mean the Horn of Valere is something beyond even the Pattern? 

&gt;My single biggest disappointment about the ending. Fain went out with way too little impact.

I don't think there was too little impact - he was basically killing everything out there and would've probably gotten to Rand too without Mat arriving.

That said, he did die a bit too easily. Mat just killed him pretty nonchalantly. And he got too little screen time to really get to you. 

I too think it could've been done better. 

&gt;HELL. YES. That was really upsetting. The big part she played was actually keeping the peace between Rand and Egwene, but I wanted MORE.

Absolutely! If nothing else, she should've been the one to see Rand go in the end instead of Cadsuane, like Leigh Butler said in her last post. That would've been so fitting for her. 

&gt;Why not?

Well because firstly, Mat's been a ta'veren all his life but the luck starts happening sometime later in the series. More than that, Rand and Perrin were ta'veren too, Rand even more than Mat. Other comments have said that their ta'veren manifested differently, but I still can't accept ta'veren as the answer to Mat's luck. To the end, I was expecting something more concrete, or even a small hint. Seems I'm the only one.

1487,"&gt;Perrin is especially familiar with Compulsion

1. Lanfear tells him that Graendal was touching Bashere's dream.

2. He overheard Graendal talking about cutting off the head of the worm.

I rest my case. 

&gt;Why do you think they picked him to defend what is simultaneously the most crucial and most contested point on the entire war map?

I thinks it's more that he was the only one left. I mean, Bryne's obviously gonna go with Egwene, and Ituralde with the Borderlanders.

Rather, I thought so. Now, it might well have been that they believed him to be the best. I made a point of noting it because people always seem to treat the Great Captains as equal, there's never talk of who's better. Which might be just politeness, I think now.

&gt;Did anyone going into this book think for one second that Mat wasn't eventually going to get stuck with the job?

Hell no! I was surprised he didn't get the job at the start. Now it's clear that all that fighting was just the prologue to the REAL Last Battle. 

&gt;I seriously think Graendal is the most dangerous Forsaken

I concur. She's the perfect mix of coward and daring. She doesn't jump headfirst into fights, but neither is she super scared and non-confrontational like Moghedien. 

&gt;A big thing is morale.

And, like I said, wouldn't the fact that their lives and the world depend on this battle be enough to motivate them?

I mean, you lose a normal battle, it's rough, but nothing like the annihilation of everything.

1550,"&gt; but my suspicion is that Androl managed to work out the access key.

A lot of people think that - like /u/fudgyvmp with his talk of keys. The flaw there, in my opinion, is that a key is an all or nothing affair - you either know it and can do anything, or you don't and you're screwed. But in Androl's case, it's clear that it was more like pushing *super* hard allowed him to make a tiny little gateway *despite* the Dreamspike.

I think that the dreamspike makes it hard to make gateways, so that the threshold - and we know there is one, since not everyone is strong enough to make them even normally - becomes way higher. So higher that it's impossible in practice. But Androl's Talent allows him to make his gateway despite all that. He can clear the threshold, but only by a small amount - hence the small gateways, the size of a coin. 

tl;dr - He is just that damn good at making gateways.

I don't think that's fair to the Greens. It's more like they're both good at different sort of battles. The Reds sure are better at 1v1 magic duel sort of scenarios, but the Greens would be more experienced at dealing with hordes of raging Shadowspawn. 

&gt;who wants a perfect messianic protagonist?

I'm guessing everyone in Randland. 

&gt;Some clever arrangements here

Thinking over it, I think part of the reason why Moiraine did all so easily is because Rand will be more willing to listen to her than any other Aes Sedai, even Elayne or Egwene. And same goes for Egwene - sort of. So she can basically get them to bend in a way that they wouldn't for each other. And once Rand and Egwene are on board, the rest is just formalities.

I was like, ""Dude, just accept that you're a good leader and move on!"" a lot of the time. 

&gt;Bornhald is all ""that makes no goddamn sense."" 

That *was* nice. I was afraid Bornhald had become crazy beyond redemption with Byar. 

&gt;Perrin/Elayne negotiations

Yeah, Elayne's stubborn streak coming into play. If it hadn't been for Morgase taking Perrin's side, it might have turned ugly. ",2015-10-19 08:16:26+00:00,cw4yqw2,2.0,t1_cw4cl36,42443.0,Fantasy

1624,"&gt;Galad chapters let us see newfound confidence

With Perrin and Rand both having become these next level super heroic sort of people, I'm hoping Mat doesn't end up becoming something like this too. He's fine as he is.

&gt;Danelle Sedai was on a short list of three or four names before this book came out

Wow. The things a dedicated fandom can dig up.

&gt;It's suggested here that Tuon died not long after the Last Battle

Here's the passage:

&gt;“If only the Seanchan Empress…” Ronam shook his head, and she knew what he was thinking. The old empress, the one who had ruled during the days of the Last Battle, had been considered a woman of honor by Ronam’s father. An understanding had nearly been reached with her, so it was said. But many years had passed since her rule.

I don't see how this says that Tuon died early or was assassinated. The way I interpreted is that there were negotiations, but it just never worked out, and with the next Empress there's even less chance of a compromise. 

&gt;I'm curious if you write as you read, or if you read then go back and write about it.

Writing as I read would be just too impractical - it would wreck the flow of reading, I think. What happens is that I mostly remember my reactions the first time I read stuff, maybe have some short notes, and then reconstruct that feeling when I'm writing the post. It's not perfect - I sometimes have to go back and comment on things, sometimes stuff slips my mind, but I do have a pretty good memory so it works out okay. It helps that I have to do this for a few chapters at most, and I generally begin the post immediately after putting down the book.

&gt; dawning horror as it becomes more and more apparent

Actually, I did not realise this at all, until Aviendha pointed it our herself. I think I just assumed that words like Stone Dogs have *always* been part of Aiel culture, abandoned when they became non-violent and then re-established when they took up the spears, that sort of thing. So it was less of a dawning horror and more a punch to the face when Aviendha said it's the future and I was like ""Oh no, nonononono""

&gt;It's really up to you whether he succeeded or not.

I really don't think he did. For a start, the entire channeling segment of the population is doomed to a life of being treated like animals. Plus the Seanchan's slavery system in general. The common people have okay lives yes, but it's not the same as they would have under someone like Elayne. 

Yeah, it's better than the Dark One winning, but otherwise, it really sucks. 

&gt;Bah, I won't complain.

Wise man.

1630,"For the first couple of books, what kept me going was assurances that the series is more than a cliched LoTR rip off. From the third book onwards, it was the fact that those assurances had been fulfilled. 

As for what exactly it is about, I'd like to quote this from /u/PrinceofDaRavens:

&gt; It's about a shepherd who's trying to come to terms with his own destiny, while tying nations together. He faces betrayal on a daily basis, his ""followers"" constantly plot against him, and he's slowly losing his sanity. He desperately tries to find the courage to push away the people that love him the most, because he knows his fate will only serve to bring them anguish.
&gt; 
&gt; It's about a farmer who gets yanked from his home and family to the great unknown. He makes mistakes. He pays for them. He struggles to do what is right, while trying to run from his own responsibilities. He picks up an army he doesn't want, but they follow him because they believe in him. He's the greatest hero of the time, even though he'll swear up and down that he's anything but.
&gt; 
&gt; It's about a blacksmith whose home gets ravaged by the face of evil. He rescues his people at the cost of his family and his entire life. His friends, neighbors, elders, and peers follow him because they have nothing left, and he leads them because he has nothing left. He struggles with his identity, with the nature of love, and with his own place in the world.
&gt; 
&gt; It's about a woman who chases after three boys from her village because she's sworn to protect them. When she discovers that she can't, she instead swears revenge on the person that took them from her. As the story develops, and her path falters, she slowly becomes the person that she hated, but finds a drive in it to keep the people around her safe; to heal what cannot be healed.


Basically, it's about the characters. WoT has some of the most well written characters I've ever seen. These people have their own unique traits without being cliched, and as the story progresses, they go through all this crazy shit that really changes them, but you can still see  that they're the same people. You love some, you hate some of them, but you can't be apathetic towards them.

Plus the world itself has some very cool stuff going for it in terms of cool stuff and cultures to see. There's the big plot which starts off with a cliched feeling ""take down the big bad"" but soon develops into its own thing which feels pretty damn interesting, and I can't wait to find out how it works out.

You misspelled glorious.

&gt;I really want to think that Sanderson wrote this sequence

Yeah, I'm pretty sure that that is the case. 

&gt;No comment on the part where Perrin literally hand-blocks a balefire stream

Well, it *is* just a weave. The way I see it, balefire is no big deal until it actually touches you. And the text clearly says ""as if blocked by his hand"". I guess it looked way more spectacular to Egwene. 

&gt;She may not be the nicest person around, but our little Eggy has turned into a hardcore lady.

Pretty sure the latter caused the former. Which is why I feel bad when people hate on her. Yes, she's not that nice to Rand, yes, she's gotten a bit rough but so what? Look at what she accomplishes! Saving everyone's asses in the Seanchan attack.  Reuniting the Tower. Taking down a Forsaken. Just because she's no longer nice doesn't justify disliking her.

&gt;I've been waiting for a long time for my wife to get started reading the last two books, just because I'm a horrible person

Yes, yes you are.

&gt; This could have been avoided if Egwene had even the slightest aptitude or training in Healing

I don't think a *slight* aptitude would help here. Gawyn was already in bad shape when he went down, and who knows how long he's been unconscious, losing blood all the time. Only the best healers could've handled this.

The context here is that I'm about 1k, been playing six months, and a few of my friend have recently started played - about a week. We play on Lan together, and for now we play against bots - hard bots. 

What are some good heroes in this situation? I tried picking supports, but they just can't carry no matter how much I help them, so it's gotta be carries. But the trouble starts when the bots start to 5 man. It's basically a huge ball of death rolling down mid, smashing everything in it's way. Any attempt to fight them is met with stunlock into death. 

""Just get BKB"" - well of course I get BKB. But once it's down to 5/6 seconds, it's the same thing - you can't kill them all in that time, and once BKB is off I have to run for my life or die. Splitpushing is the only thing that works so far - trouble there is that by the time I have some items + BoTs, they've knocked down mid rax, and maybe more depending on how the game is going. And god help us if they have CK or Riki. I carry dust and wards, but there's only so much I can do to stop them feeding Riki.

1700,"&gt;Mat is legitimately a country bumpkin

Yeah, I totally agree with the country bumpkin thing. IIRC he never really got any proper education. Plus, I felt he was trying to be fancy since it was a letter to the Queen, but bungling it hilariously. 

&gt;watching Jedi Jesus Rand repair a huge chunk of the damage Darth Rand did in just a few pages is pretty impressive

I think it's partly because he seems to have this feel-good aura around him, which must make it easier to get people to forgive him and be good guys in general.

1703,"Yay! As a somewhat avid gamer, I'm looking forward to seeing what the sub comes up with for this list. 


**Warcraft III** : The game that made me fall in love with Blizzard. The plot is a pretty straightforward huge demon army invasion, but a young me couldn't have enough of it. Plus the amazing CGI cutscenes were a treat to watch. It is one of the few games that I've played multiple times, and each times the gameplay holds up, even though the graphics are beginning to feel aged.

**Diablo II** : While WC3 was plot and gameplay and strategy, this was all about the progression - the thrill of taking down a huge boss, the joy of finding a new item that makes your character even stronger, leveling up and then spending hours figuring out the most effective skill build. Damn but I spent so many hours on this. 

**Fable** : This game was just great lighthearted fun - made for a nice change from the serious tone most games go for. 10/10 would get called a chicken chaser again. 

**Shadow of Mordor** : It's an LoTR game, but only in name. The setting is basically spot on, but the actual gameplay is heavily inspired from the excellent Arkham games from Rocksteady. Which is a good thing, because they have the best combat system. The joy of flying through hordes of enemies, building up combos and executing awesome finishing moves, the badass feeling you get when hunting trolls from the shadows. The story itself was a bit of a bore though. 

**Dishonored** : This might be toeing the fantasy line, but I'm gonna include it anyway because the game was so damn good. The revenge story is good enough - by the end you really do feel like taking down those sonofabitches, but the star for me was the level design. You get dropped into a huge map with one objective, and almost total freedom on how to achieve it. So many ways and methods, so many tools at your disposal. That click when you spot a way around an obstacle. One of the best stealth games I've played. And the DLC is just as great.


**Battle Realms** : This is a game that really deserved more success IMO. I haven't really seen it mentioned online much, but I loved it to bits. The story was about a returning prince trying to reclaim his kingdom, and there was a lot of branching paths to achieve this, not to mention two whole different paths depending on which side you choose at the beginning, making you either a just ruler or a ruhtless tyrant. The gameplay was RTS, with four very distinct clans all with their own large variety of units and buildings. Shame it never got a sequel. 

**Kingdoms of Amalur** : I've seen it compared to Skyrim a lot, but I think it's quite different, and also way more fun. Skyrim always felt a bit too grindy to me. Kingdoms of Amalur is fun from the get-go, and stays so throughout. The world is absolutely huge - but unlike snowy Skyrim, we get all sorts of varied environments. And the best part way the flexibility in gameplay it offered. Unlike most RPGs, you're not stuck with whichever of the mage/rogue/warrior paths you choose. You can switch all the time or mix and match as you please. Loads of fun. 

**Dota 2** : This is the new kid on the block - for me at least. It's a MOBA, which means there's no plot or anything, just a 5v5 capture the flag sort of battle. The fun comes from the large variety of characters available - 110 and counting, which means each match is it's own little story. There are depressing stomps, exciting turnaround, unexpected tactics - and so much more. It's a really complex game with a pretty steep learning curve, but also very rewarding when you start to get it. The only downside is that like with most online games, the community can be dicks at times. The plus side is the pro scene, watching high level games is just as fun as playing!


**Witcher 2** : For the amazing graphics, the unusual, difficult gameplay system, the intricate plot. Witcher 3 would be here too, but my aging laptop is no longer strong enough :'(

**Dragon Age : Inquisition** : This is Bioware's superb Mass Effect style brought to the Dragon Age universe. Which is great, because Mass Effect is my favorite series ever. The characters in this one don't have that much impact - since you don't spend three games with them, but making up for it is the gameplay which is a nice mix of strategy and action, and the huge sprawling world chock full of sidequests that are often just as fun as the main plotline.

1708,"Zeus is my most played hero with &gt;60% winrate, but I'm also in 1k tier so there's that. 

I really don't like you build.

1. No bottle. If you're going mid, you need the bottle. Clarities and Arcanes are fine, but you need a bottle. Arcanes gives 135 mana every 55 second, bottle can give 210 mana every two minutes (more if you get two runes or bottle crow) plus the healing. And you can keep runes for when you really need them. You gotta get a bottle.

2. I see that you keep Arcanes AND bloodstone. IMO you'd be better off disassembling the mana booster and putting it into your bloodstone. With bloodstone, the regen from arcanes is not really worth it. Better to make your bloodstone a couple minutes earlier. Just keep the Brown boots, upgrade to BoTs if you have the gold or the need. 

3. The Aghs. Yeah, I used to love Aghs too, but it's not that good. Really. At level 16, it gives your ult 165 more damage. At that point, it's just not worth it for a 4200 gold item. Yeah it also gives a bigger mana pool, but you don't need that with your bloodstone. If you skip it, you can get your refresher way earlier, and even build up an octarine core, which is amazing on Zeus.   

4. No mobility. Zeus has no inbuilt escapes. If you get caught, you are very likely dead. You need some way to avoid that. I prefer blink, but Force staff or even eul's scepter might do. At least one of these is a must. 


Also, apart from these, you might want to consider Veil - as others have pointed out, or Shiva's Guard. It gives armor for survivability, more mana, and a pretty good aura and a very handy active. Here's how I generally play Zeus:

Go into lane with 2 gg brances. That's it. Yeah, I have no regen, but with 4 last hits, I can get a bottle. Generally it's fast enough that I bring the bottle, use the charges before the first rune appears. Keep bottling and harassing. If you get a good rune, go gank some fools. 

Get magic wand - for stats and for the burst heal to get out of sticky situations, then boots, arcan boots, soul ring, bloodstone (disassembling the arcanes). At this point, I'm set as far as mana goes. Next is generally blink dagger, and then refresher. The refresher is a bit delayed, but if I rush it I find I don't have enough mana for the full combo anyways. Next, I get a mystic staff, which I'll upgrade into either Shiva's or Octarine, whichever I feel like. Shiva's is good against a lot of physical DPS - there's move and AS slow, plus you get more armor. Octarine is good to amp up your DPS even more. People often recommend veil, but I haven't yet tried it, mostly because I'm 1k and there's only so many active items I can handle. Next I get Boots of Travel for more speed and mobility. At this point most games are over, else get Octarine/Shiva's. (whichever one I didn't buy earlier). 

As for playstyle, it's basically same as you. Chill in mid harassing the shit out of your enemy, looking around the map to help out with my ult once I have it. I also recommend getting more last hits. You have 95 CS in a 52 minute game, which is pretty bad. Try going to the jungle occasionally - your arc lightning will naturally push the lane, so I basically push the wave a bit, then go clear a camp/take a rune before coming back. And even without that, just keep spamming your spells once laning phase is over and you can get more CS that this. 

Hope this helps.

1727,"&gt;She plays the vampy, hedonistic Uberslut role

Which coincidentally allows her to live the luxury life most of the time, so that's a plus. And this is why I feel like we lost even though we exchanged one Forsaken for another - Aran'gar is dangerous, but Graendal far more so.

&gt;how badly it would have gone if it had happened with Darth Rand.

I think it would just never happen with him. Darth Rand would never, ever, ever just walk alone into the White Tower. He'd be too scared. But yeah, I get what you mean. He'd probably rage the fuck out the moment Egwene refused to go along with his plan. It's funny - he tried always to suppress emotion, but just ended up suppressing the positive things, while still having raving rages. 

&gt;Same place. Perrin does not know the name Tel'aran'rhiod

Oh yeah. It gets tricky sometimes, keeping track of who knows what. 

&gt;Sanderson's tendency to actually name things

This I really like about him. Not the Everything Has a Capital Name part, but still. I mean, we have names for everything, right? We don't call bulbs the lighting devices or whatever. Similarly, it makes sense there'd be names for all these *ter'angreal*. What I like even more is that we hear them only from the people who actually would know these names. The Aes Sedai still just do it the RJ way. Plus names make talking about things way easier. Every time the door ter'angreal used to enter the Eelfin/Aelfinn came up, I found myself wishing the thing had a proper name. 


&gt;Mat is consistently pretty much the least reliable narrator when it comes to himself

I don't think the battles example you mention as unreliable. Mat genuinely hates fights, but the plot just keeps dragging him into them. This though - of course Mat knows he's still leering after women because he likes it. Why would he pretend otherwise with himself?

Yeah, I noticed that. My guess is that Sanderson decided to give him more POVs.

&gt;one of the most foreshadowed Black sisters of all

More than, say, Liandrin? I've generally been pretty bad at picking up clues of Blacks - most of their reveals are a surprise to me.

&gt;So, from the instant you saw this, how strongly did your oshit meter start pinging?

Not at all. It was more like, nice try Cadsuane, but it doesn't seem to be working that well. But Tam and Rand were still having a pretty oaky chat. But then Tam mentioned Cadsuana bringing him and I was like uh oh. 

&gt;WoT is not, across-the-board, a really great place to be a commoner.

Well this *is* the end times, so it's not a great place to be, period. In more normal times though, I think plenty of the commoners have a good time. Andorans in particular don't take any shit from nobles. Plus the Borderlands nobles are just decent people and seem to treat their subject well. Actually, Tear felt to me more like the exception rather than the rule. 

&gt;pretty darned decent for your average mudfoot commoner.

Unless you happen to look funny at the bloody Blood, in which case you get killed in some inventive way.

1758,"Indeed. I've read it - though I did read the prologue of ToM first. The first glimpse we get of new and improved Rand is so uplifting. It really would make for a nice follow through to Veins of Gold. 

The trouble with more posts is that they take time. So far I've found a nice balance where I have a couple posts a week while keeping a natural pace of reading, but if I do more, then that'll slow down my progress through the series which is hard to do because this is the end and I already want to rush through it. Stopping every couple chapters to do a post would be hard. Get what I mean? 

I've actually felt this myself recently - when reading, I have these little thoughts that I think I'd like to include in the post, but I can't talk about everything I'd like to, because that would mean I could cover like one chapter in the whole post. Maybe when I get to the reread, I could do bigger posts at a slower pace - like what Leigh Butler did - taking a couple years almost to do the whole series. 

As for the next series suggestion, I'm always in a Sanderson mood - he's my favorite fantasy writer. But the trouble with The Stormlight Archive is that it's not finished. It's not even close. Which is why I've been waiting on it, despite being totally eager to read them.

And yes, I do remember the veins of gold being mentioned earlier, and I think it was a nice connection.

Yeah, I'm really looking forward to finding out what the deal with him is. Like, if he and Rand are the same person then what is the a seperate voice in Rand's head? Although the end of TGS indicated they've fused together or something. We'll see.

Besides that, one thing I've started doing - if the lane is getting pushed and I'm having trouble last hitting - is just go pull myself, even if I'm playing a carry, if the supports don't do it. Also try to stack a camp when you go for the rune. 

Finally, if you can, be a bit aggressive. If you can trade harass better, then you can keep your opponent scared and have an easier time farming the creeps.

1802,"&gt;Ouch. I really liked this section of Perrin's story, coming off the depression that was the Shaido story.

OK, so I might've gone a bit overboard. Yes, it makes sense that Perrin has some concerns. But he just seems to be making too much of a big deal of it. Like his worries about leadership. He's doing fine. He led them through this totally nuts adventure and everything turned out more or less well. And as for the wolf, so he gets a bit ferocious in battle, well who doesn't? I remember him talking to Elyas about the same thing, and Elyas also told him to chill.

&gt;SO LONG YOU HAVE NO IDEA

Pffft. A few months at the most. I think what made the whole thing so much worse is that we are really put into Rand's head. Like even the line before this one: ""He could feel her pulse throbbing beneath his fingers."" Too damn concrete. 

&gt;people might cheer over Cads being put in her place

For a change I don't think she deserved what she got. Sure, she has faults, but this was not her fault. I mean, the Dark One wanted this to happen. No way she could've kept the *a'dam* safe. And even if she'd destroyed it somehow (how do you destroy ter'angreal?), he'd have found another one for sure. Although Rand doesn't know that he was directly involved, so maybe it makes a bit more sense for him to place all the blame on Cads. Still way too harsh. 

&gt;Wait, hold on. I'd really like to discuss this. What do you mean here?

I had a bit of trouble wording it myself. The thing is, all through her apprenticeship, it's been expected of Aviendha that she will obey the Wise Ones completely, and that is what she was doing, and turns out what she needed to do was the opposite. Which just feels overly convoluted to me. What's wrong with just nicely telling her that her apprenticeship is over? 

For once the Aes Sedai way makes way more sense. You get a test, and yes it's tough as hell and takes a lot of guts to pass, but you know what you're supposed to be doing. 

I guess the anger comes from imagining myself in Aviendha's shoes. Maybe it makes more sense if your'e an Aiel.

&gt;It was a brilliant plan, Mat! Until it wasn't a brilliant plan at all!

It wasn't that brilliant even without the spooky stuff going on. You now have a tavern full of people who just lost a lot of their food and stuff in a time when it's already pretty scarce, and who knows how they'll react. 

&gt; to help establish exactly how ""frayed"" the world was getting as the Dark One gained strength.

I don't think we needed any more help establishing that. 

&gt; I surmise that Semirhage might have intended to go back for it

Actually she probably didn't know that it was there. It was Elza who gave her the *a'dam*. My guess is she was controlled somehow into doing this by the DO, or handed the collar directly. Either way, it was his decision to leave it behind. I think maybe because he knew Rand might do some crazy shit with it.

It's quite the dilemma. You want the characters to change - because it would be weird if they stay the same while going through all this crazy stuff, yet you don't want the change to be so radical that readers think this is not how RJ would've done it. A very fine line to walk.

1860,"&gt;She's just really freaking bad at dealing with crisis situations

Which is exactly what leadership is about. *Anyone* can be a good leader when things are going well. It's only when things start to go hairy that we really need a good leader. It's like saying that a goalkeeper is could've succeeded but he's just really bad at stopping the ball. 

I wonder if it's something inherent about the Red. I mean, right off the bat, they hate half the world, so that can't make things go anything smoother. And they all seem to a bit of a pain in the ass. Kind of like the Slytherins of Tar Valon. Not bad in theory - catching crazy men is good - but just kind of bad in practice.

&gt;The Band has a collection of some of the most fun people in the series

I feel I'm the only one who doesn't feel that way. I mean, yes, they're good people, but I just don't feel that strongly about any of them. It's like, they're just there to be Mat's army. Even Vanin. I mean, he's sneaky and he's fat, and that's basically all we know. I just haven't developed the sort of - well, liking - for him as for say, Mat, or even Nynaeve.

&gt;There's a lot here that I'll call back to later, it's extremely relevant to the sections of Perrin's character development and plot

Whaat? It was just a big battle. Perrin's been in plenty of those. I'll look forward to seeing how it becomes relevant later.

&gt;Rand, who... still has issues with women.

Probably *the* biggest issue I have with him. Like, I understand not wanting to kill women or see them die. Or give preference to their lives over men. Not something I like, but I understand. But he just takes it so damn far. Like, the Dark One could hide behind a random woman and Rand would just be like okay, I have either to kill him and risk killing this lady, or the world is done for, so goodbye world.

Indeed.

&gt;Because if they're too obedient, you have nobody around to tell you you're wrong.

I guess you have a point here. But I have to say, Cadsuane said this in reference to two random guards. I mean, yeah, you want someone to point out your mistakes, but you definitely don't want every single person in your army questioning you and you having to explain yourself every time you give them an order. Rand in particular is not at risk of a Barbarossa, IMO, because, like you said, he's got all these women around him who are not at all impressed by his Dragon Reborn-iness. 

&gt;Fun story: RJ alluded to this particular passage in prerelease talks about something that'll make people look up and say ""Oh, how horrible!"" while reading, which was an aftereffect of the Cleansing.

Oh. Well yeah, it just didn't work. First, like you said, because this is like the first time we know about the Amayar. But also, I think, because it was second hand news. Maybe if we'd actually witnessed it, it would've been more impactful.

Well I though it was more appropriate you know, because this is his turf, so to speak. Plus I didn't know you hanged out here.

&gt; a bit slow and unlikely to be useful as a weapon against modern rifles.

Ineteresting you should say that, because I recently read the scene in KoD where [spoiler](#s ""Rand/LTT and the Ashaman take out a huge army of trollocs before they can even get in fighting range"") The range on the Power is I think enough that they can stand against rifles. Plus the Two Rivers^TM longbows have a range that sounds similar-ish to guns.

&gt;we spend a lot of time around the very most powerful channelers around

Exactly. And in a huge battle, they would be at the forefront. It's not like people will send Morgase to go channel at the enemy. Adn they are few in number, but I think with their *sa'angreal* they can wreck any army we could throw at them.

&gt;enough channeler strength to compare to what we could bring to bear

A pair of statues come to mind. Rand could single handedly destroy us with that.

&gt;Randland soldiers are basically a nonentity

1881,"I think that pretty much no fantasy world has the kind of population that we have - most of them are pretty sparsely populated by today's standards. Secondly, if things get desperate, there are nukes. They'd all be dead before they go a chance to retaliate. But let's assume we are unwilling to do a nuclear wipeout.

Let's do some of the prominent ones. 

Mistborn. Scadrial. Let's take the modern-ish age Scadrial from Alloy of Law. They have Allomancy, but if we can just figure out non-metallic weapons they are done for. I think with polymers and stuff we could work something out. Or else there's always biochemcial warfare. None of the allomantic powers give healing. So we could probably wipe them out with zero shots fired. Sure, soem special ones like the gold twinborns would survive, but I'd say victory is assured. 

Eragon. Their dragon riders are pretty damn strong, but at the time the series ended, there were not enough of them to be significant on a global scale, IMO. But both the elves and the dwarves have pretty secure strongholds, so that would be a lot of trouble. Plus most elves have magic abilities so that would be pretty hard to deal with. This one would be a pretty drawn out battle, but I think we could defeat them in the end with sheer numbers.

Wheel of Time. Randland is pretty tough to crack. I haven't finished the series, so I don't know what state it is in by the end. At the point I am however, the channelers are definitely pretty strong. [spoilers](#s ""Rand even has a weapon that can match our nukes in the form of the Choedan Kal""). The Seanchan and the Aiel are pretty strong military forces, especially if you factor in *damane* and Wise Ones. I honestly think that either side could be the winner. It's pretty even, IMO. Paging /u/MikeOfThePalace for an expert opinion.

Harry Potter. For this one there's a shared world, so nuking it is anyway not an option. That said, the wizards, though powerful, are very low in numbers. But if they can Imperius some important people, they can be a big menace. Plus there's polyjuice potion. OTOH, they lose for sure in an open army vs army style of fighting.

But, in sheer terms of numbers, the Whitecloaks aren't *that* strong? I don't have the exact numbers, but they probably aren't even worth one Aiel clan.

&gt;Ishamael was the most obvious choice for a while as long as you didn't assume Moridin was a newly-minted Forsaken.

&gt;That hasn't really worked out all that well for Rand

IIRC the reason he went to the Waste in *The Shadow Rising* was because he read about it in the Prophecies. And without that he wouldn't have this huge badass Aiel army that got him a bunch of kingdoms.

Could be. There are definitely signs that the strain is getting to them. 

&gt;a lot of people dislike this particular storyline

And no wonder. If only Faile was rescued in the book it would've been better. As it is, there were so many Perrin chapters, but all I recall from a big plot perspective is him getting some grain and at the very end considering an alliance with the Seanchan.

&gt;know what I mean?

Um, no. I'm not good with subtle relationship points. I get that they seem to developing some sort of relationship, but that's all I got.

&gt;It's not insignificant that Tuon goes about even with Mat in the game.

Well I just assumed as a princess and with the signs that succession is not clear cut and there's a lot of rivalry, she's good at strategic thinking. Is there more to it than that?

She could just do it a couple miles away from the city proper. I guess it's just one of the cases where the characters don't really think about the stuff they can do with the power, and we have to accept that and move on.

&gt;Frankly, I genuinely wonder whether a maximum circle (72 participants) could match Rand with that stupid little statuette.

Ok, let's do a rough numbers analysis. First we need to quantify strengths. Let's assign 2 to women and 4 to men in general - we know that men are stronger, and assume that circle linking works multiplicatively. Assuming (I'm just pulling so much stuff out of thin air) equal numbers of men and women. That gives us 2^36 * 4^36 = 2^108, which is approximately 250000000000000000000000000000000. That's 31 zeros. No way is Rand that strong, even with Sa'angreal. If he was, he wouldn't just be able to destroy nations or continents, he'd be able to destroy planets or even solar systems.

2012,"One thing the top answer hasn't addressed is the sheer logistical hassle of it. How do you give the customer the code? How do you combine it with a typical bookstore where people are free to browse through books first?

Put it in the book? People are gonna steal the code and download the book without buying the physical copy.

Seal the book so they can't do the above? People are going to hate you for it. Unlike movies or games, we book buyers love to flip through a book, read a few lines here and there, before buying it.

Have the staff include it in the receipt? But you gotta convince them to do something that's of zero benefit to them.

I'm not saying that it's just logistically impossible - there's workarounds, and most of this doesn't even apply to online retailers. We are seeing some sort of discount though - for some books you get a big discount on the ebook if you have the physical copy. 

And also, if you think about it, ebooks take effort too. Making sure that it woks well well with all the various devices and screen sizes and formats out there etc. Yeah, copying them once you have the first one is free, but it does take money to get to the first one.

Um, Gareth Bryne for sure. And that Shienaran lord we met in EoTW in Fal Dara, missing his name. Probably Bashere too. That's all I got.

&gt;He's a bit controversial

Why? He's basically a standard noble warrior, loving bro to Elayne, Egwene's love interest. Nothing controversial. Maybe the fact that he fought for Elaida, but he just didn't have the information he needed to make the right decision at the time.

&gt;Remind me what makes you think this? 

It was the description given by the servant who broke the news. 

*“They all say his rooms are covered with blood. He was found lying in a great pool of it. With his head cut off, they say.”*

Turned out she was full of crap.

&gt;She's one of the few people who can put cracks in Mat's poker face by this point.

Though it's less what she is and does, and more the prophecy. Anyone would be nervous if the woman you'd kidnapped was the one destined to be your wife.

I have to disagree on that. Yes, Sanderson and LoTR are not full of gratuitous in-your face violence, but that's not mean things are all happy-go-lucky. Like LoTR. They're on this miserable voyage that is all but hopeless. They go through so much terrible stuff, interspersed with some nice times. And even at the end, even when they succeed, it's not like ""they lived happily ever after"". There's this whole feel of sadness and loss. 

Or Mistborn. Book one starts with a world with falling ash, no greenery or flowers, most of the people miserable slaves to an immortal tyrant. And things get worse from there.

So it's less that only grimdark has bad stuff, it's just that grimdark has *only* that. EVERYONE is an immoral backstabbing bastard, EVERYTHING is crappy. 

And that basically forms my answer. I mind neither light nor dark stuff. I just like a balance. So there's the occasional grimdark, but usually I stick to stuff that will occasionally make me smile and hope.",2015-07-31 13:13:28+00:00,ctmqcmf,1.0,t3_3fa58o,3572.0,Fantasy

* **Ready Player One** by Ernest Cline. It was just fun for me.

* **The Day of The Jackal** by Frederick Forsyth. I generally don't read suspense/thrillers (it often feels like the author is trying too hard to create tension), but this one is *so* good. And the realism and attention to detail is superb, it almost feels like something that could've actually happened, not some made up story.

* **The Night's Dawn Trilogy** by Peter F. Hamillton. My favorite space opera bar none. Telepathic spaceships, nanotechnology, FTL travel, weapons of star destruction, space zombies, exotic aliens, huge battles... This one has it all. The books are some of the longest I've read, but I still raced through them.


* **A World Undone** by G.J. Meyer. This book about the First World War singlehandedly made me more interested in history.

Ever heard of Stockholm Syndrome? But yeah, I agree. There is a certain fondness in his thoughts by this time.

That said, I'm not nearly as confident as you about the success of the Warcraft movie. The plot seems to be the WC1/2 time plot of a conflict between orcs and humans. Which at this point I have to say is a really stale concept. It was fine as a backdrop to good RTS gameplay, but I don't know how well it will hold out on it's own as a feature length movie.

As for your point that CGI will be the selling point - it may have been true when it was new, but at this point, CGI is commonplace. It's not going to be enough to draw crowds.

And even if it does succeed, it's going to be boosting video game movies more than high fantasy epics. ",2015-07-24 09:03:47+00:00,ctee0zx,1.0,t3_3ec8nr,59311.0,Fantasy

It's a great time to be a reader. The cost is basically zero to begin with. You have free ebooks of all the classics, then there's libraries. 

Books can get expensive - but that's only for stuff like First Editions or rare books. If you want just to read, ebooks give a great value for money. The most expensive thing you might have to invest in a dedicated e-reader if a smartphone/pc doesn't cut it.

The best way to start out would be to ask your bookworm friends - tell them what sort of movies/tv shows etc you like, what you'd like to read about, and they'll be able to suggest something suitable.

2266,"A pretty fun game as Lich : http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1642767223

I usually like to go solo offlane as Lich, I can easily handle lane equilibrium with Sacrifice and Frost Armor. I don't get too much farm, but Lich doesn't care about that anyway. I get an early Chain Frost (extra early because of the sacrifice XP), get a few kills on unsuspecting foes, then roll out to other lanes.

So, this match. We were up against a pretty cancerous draft - troll, bara, pa, riki, LC. So I'm chilling out top, when Witch Doctor joins me. I'm like, dude, what is even the point of two supports laning together? Go help ursa and wind bot. This being low skill (&lt;1k), he did not respond in any way. Thinking that my standard strategy was not going to work because WD sharing XP, I went bot to help the cores get farm, and harass PA who was bot too.

Except they're all, WTF you're doing Lich, go top. I told them what I was doing, but it seems trilane is a foreign concept to them. I didn't want to listen to their crap, so I went top. Wind was especially bitchy. 

So, back to top lane, we and WD actually get a few picks and start to get levels. Meanwhile, Wind and Ursa are having a bad time bot, and I'm actually happy to see this. Yeah, I know, shitty attitude, but I was like, ""See, wind, this is why I was trying to help you"". Anyway, luckily me and WD keep getting stuff done, sniper is snipering mid and we get ahead after a bit of struggle and win the game. I ended with 9/4/11, pretty good for a hard support. Wind is 4/10/15. Ha!

Why not both?

&gt;If it was Elenia's husband who orchestrated it, Naean will be forced to declare his House Arawn's support for Elenia under threat of torture or death. If it was Naean's people who did it, he'll try to do the same to Elenia, but Elenia's husband is still loose and if he hears that Elenia is in Naean's hands he'll send troops to rescue her.

Or, you know, they were taken by some third party. But I got it now. After some mental gymnastics.

This is actually applied to a lot of stuff, and I just want to say that it's quite a stretch. I'm just not talking about the effect of the Oath Road. Traveling, making *ter'angreal*, etc. Like, the male channelers died after the Breaking, but the women were still around. They would have known and remembered. And the White Tower has IIRC never fallen, so their library should have all that info. There is the matter of translation issues with the Old Tongue, but even still. I mean, unless they made an actual effort to erase this knowledge, it's very unlikely they'd just forget that taking these Oaths cuts your short by half! /rant

2301,"So I usually try to be positive and courteous to my team, and always try to do my best. But yesterday I just broke down in a BH game. During the rune fight bot, me and Timbersaw ended up against Mirana. A few hits were traded, and I decided to try and get the kill on her. So I'm chasing her, and she's running circles around the grove which has the left neutral camp on the radiant bot jungle. 

Our movespeeds are almost even (I have 5 more) so basically I run up to her, get a hit and continue the chase, slowly whittling down her health. Meanwhile I'm pinging my team for some help, but no reesponse. This goes on for THREE MINUTES. The Mirana by this time was down to like 15% health, but then their AA arrives and they chase me out (he's way higher in levels by this time - me and her are 1, he's like 3/4). 

I was *pissed*. I proceeded to die to towers, but that didn't work of course - after a certain point, you don't really give that much gold because you're so behind. So I bought a bunch of couriers, and fed them instead. But now I was out of gold, so I farmed a bit, got a kill, bought more couriers, rinse and repeat. The team is asking me to stop, interspersed with ""noob bh"" comments, but I'm determined to throw.

But then my potato internet went down and by the time I got connected again, dota2 couldn't find the game session or something. I tried to look at dotabuff for the result, but the match wasn't there. I guess it ended up not scored or something. I don't know.

I feel like the hero can be really great, esp. lategame when he gets his key items, but I feel like I don't have that much impact. Like this game, we tried to push but just couldn't break high ground without heavy casualties even when I was fully farmed. Like, we could push the lanes super easy with my manta illusions and cleave damage, but I felt useless when fights broke out.

So I kind of feel that I'm playing the hero wrong somehow. ",2015-07-10 11:47:04+00:00,csyh395,1.0,t3_3cs1qw,10777.0,learndota2

2405,"This is not one of the common recs, but I'd really like to recommend Adrian Tchaikovsky's Shadows of The Apt Series. There's 10 books, and it is completed.

The first big draw for me is the world - instead of elf/dwarf/dragons, there are races based on insects (there's no such thing as a ""normal"" human). So there's the tiny agile Fly-kinden who can fly, the Mantis-kinden who are unmatched melee fighters, the slow but sturdy Beetle-kinden, and many more. It makes for a refreshing change.

The second is the plot itself. At it's core, it's the imperialistic Wasp empire who wants to conquer everyone versus the various small city states who must overcome their mutual distrust and hate to stand against a common enemy. There's intrigue, spying, politics, epic battles and whatnot. Totally awesome stuff.

The third thing I liked is the conflict between magic and technology. The world is undergoing rapid technological progress - kind of like post steam engine, but there are some races that can't use tech, but magic. In fact, magic was the predominant power in the early days, until the rise of tech, and now it is on the decline.

Yeah, all said and done, epic series with a huge scale and ambition. And the author manages to pull it off very well indeed. ",2015-07-03 14:07:36+00:00,csqzy6q,1.0,t3_3bz9id,13202.0,Fantasy

Okay, for ideas, I'd say try Hyperion. The first book is simply amazing, though I find the second one did not match up. Still, it's more than worth it if you only read the first. 

Edit : Also, you should try Bioware's other RPG series - Dragon Age. The first one is kind of like D&amp;D, but the next two are quite a lot like Mass Effect in a lot of ways.

A lot of people would actually find that underwhelming, because they want to get to [spoiler](#s ""All the magic stuff - the Deepness, the well, etc.""). And so they feel that book 2 is not as good. Plus Elend. Sanderson really liked him as a character, and so gives him a lot of screen time, but even ardent Mistborn fan as I am, I find him boring. Plus the [spoiler](#s ""lack of Kelsier"").

It's actually the longest series I've read (until I read the last seven books of WoT).
