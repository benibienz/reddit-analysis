One was The Wheel of Time, which I read last year. It was a great read, no doubt, but blogging about my journey as I went made it way more engaging and fun. So naturally, now that it’s time for the second big read, I’ll be blogging about it as well. Check out my [WoT read](https://theadventuresofabookworm.wordpress.com/2015/02/27/big-read-the-wheel-of-time/) for how I expect this to go down.

I expect Malazan to be a whole different beast though. It’s shorter than WoT, but from what I’ve heard, it’s much more challenging, but fans claim it is totally worth the effort. Let’s hope I’m up to the task, with a little help from the Malazan veterans when I get overwhelmed.

Right now, I’m only planning to read the ten books by Steven Erikson, and leave the other stuff – Kharkanas, Malazan Empire etc. – for later.

I plan to be fairly regular, with 1-2 blog posts every week, and I’ll be posting them to reddit as well, on /r/Malazan as well as here. I might even do book reviews at the end of each book.

My blog is [The Adventures of A Bookworm](https://theadventuresofabookworm.wordpress.com/), and I'll link all the Malazan posts on the [Big Read : Malazan](https://theadventuresofabookworm.wordpress.com/big-read-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen/) page.

There’s two big series that I always wanted to tackle. One was The Wheel of Time, which I read last year. It was a great read, no doubt, but blogging about my journey as I went made it way more engaging and fun. So naturally, now that it’s time for the second big read, I’ll be blogging about it as well. Check out my [WoT read](https://theadventuresofabookworm.wordpress.com/2015/02/27/big-read-the-wheel-of-time/) for how I expect this to go down.

I expect Malazan to be a whole different beast though. It’s shorter than WoT, but from what I’ve heard, it’s much more challenging, but fans claim it is totally worth the effort. Let’s hope I’m up to the task, with a little help from the Malazan veterans when I get overwhelmed.

In order to promote diversity and shake things up a bit, this year everyone gets ten votes. Credit to /u/p0x0rz whose format I'm still copying. 

Rules are simple:

**1. Make a list of your top TEN *favorite* books/series in a new post in this thread**

Just post your top ten series or individual books. If the book is *part* of a series, then we'll count is *as* the series. For example, if Midnight Tides is your favorite Malazan book, it'll be a vote for Malazan. If the book is standalone, (for example *Lions of Al-Rassan by Guy Kay), it'll be listed by itself. By favorite I don't mean the books you think are *best*, just your favorite series. The series you loved the most. This thread isn't meant to be a commentary on what series/books are objectively  best...Just what you Redditors love the most.

**2. Only one book from any single series, please, with a few exceptions**

~~Those exceptions being series or worlds that are so vast that they encompass many, many series. A great example of this is the Cosmere.~~
~~But the *Mistborn* books, either the original trilogy or the Wax &amp; Wayne books, count as one. Same goes for First Law and all its standalones, or Discworld, or the Realms of the Elderlings by Robin Hobb.~~

~~I know there's a lot of gray areas here, but I don't want to forcibly bunch up everything from the same universe together, but every single book having it's own entry is also not right, so I'll just have to decide on a case to case basis.~~ 

Scratch that, apparently /u/p0x0rz conducted a poll a while back, and so everything on the same world will get one entry. Disworld, Riyria, First Law, Realm of the Elderlings, Broken Empire...

**3. Please leave all commentary and discussion for the discussion posts under each original post**

In your voting posts, please just list your top ten. This thread has the potential to be huge, and it'll make it far easier to compile data if the original posts are only votes. In the followup posts, discussion as to choices is encouraged! 

**4. Upvotes/downvotes will have no effect on the tally**

Feel free to upvote and downvote as you like, especially if someone has a great list. That being said, I decided to go with the ""top ten"" instead of the upvote/downvote voting for several reasons: You only have to vote once, you don't have to revisit the thread over and over to vote on new arrivals, you can vote once in just a few minutes as opposed to scrolling through a mammoth thread, etc.

**5. Voting info**

Each item you list will count as one vote toward that book or series. 

**6. No pure sci fi!**


Steampunk is ok as long as it's primarily fantasy. A good example of this is Brian Mclellan's *Powder Mage* trilogy. If you think it fits a broad definition of fantasy, then it is fantasy. This rule only really cuts out things like *Star Wars* or *The Expanse.* Stuff that's only interpretable as sci fi. Books like *The Stand* are fine.



**The voting will run for exactly one week** 

Seven days should be enough time for people to edit votes if they forgot a series they loved, and also allow the lurkers that only visit once every few days time to vote.

**Please keep your votes on a separate line, and mention the author, for easier counting.**

To do the former, you have to keep a blank line between every vote.

So vote! Discuss!

It's not the WHAM sort of twists like Sanderson, but it kept the book fresh for me till the end. 

I really can't say much more without spoiling, so just go read it. And I would strongly recommend trying the audiobook. It's a bit russian accented, which mildly annoyed me at first, but then I fell in love with it.

I already linked to my [review](https://theadventuresofabookworm.wordpress.com/2016/01/27/37-the-bands-of-mourning-by-brandon-sanderson/), but that was spoiler free, and I must talk about this stuff to someone!

First let's get the bad stuff out of the way. Telsin being a bad guy? Saw that coming for ages. I was suspicious from the moment Wax rescued her. Also, the fake bracers with the real Band(s?) of Mourning hidden in plain sight felt cliched to me, though I can't recall a specific case of something similar right now.

But apart from that, wow! Steris! She was OK in Shadows of Self, but I totally fell in love with her this time around. Especially after the talk about the birds and the bees she and Wax had in the train. Apparently to balane that out, I also started to kinda hate Wayne. I mean, it's one thing not to like Steris, another thing to sabotage her wedding!

And I love that we finally have people outside the Final Empire, so to speak. It always bothered me a little that even after Harmony fixing things, only the Elendel basin and nearby areas seemed to be inhabited. Can't wait to find out more about them. 

Which leads very nicely to Kelsier! The epilogue was full of tantalising hints, but this was the big one. Was the person in the memory really Kelsier? How did he survive? Is he STILL AROUND?  Hopefully the Secret History novella will have some answers, as soon as Amazon is kind enough to deliver it to my Kindle!

Then there's Trell. I was pretty skeptical about him, and half though that it was just a red herring, until the red eyed whatever blew up Suit at the end. Clearly it's related to some other goings on in the Cosmere - Harmony protecting Scadrial from the red haze and whatnot, but since I haven't read Stormlight and the other Cosmere novellas, I probably missed a lot of hints. Plenty of time to catch up before the Lost Metal. But I can't wait to see what sort of crazy stuff happens when the full extent of Feruchemy/Hemalurgy/Allomancy is revealed, not to mention when it mixes with other forms of Investiture.

I mean, yes, I get that it isn't easy to have all the 50ish chapters with a good title, but compared to writing a whole book and getting it published, that's nothing.

I love it when authors include chapter titles, it just seems to make the book more memorable, of sorts. And the rereads are so much more fun, when you actually understand the chapter titles. 

I especially loved the Harry Potter ones. All of them were pretty un-spoilery on a first read, but then make so much sense. And they're pretty memorable too. Talons and Tealeaves. Mudbloods and Murmurs. The Deathday Party. Quidditch. The Seven Potters. King's Cross. 

But it seems to be unfortunately rare. Among my recent reads, only WoT had chapter titles. And I think that's a shame. In a way, it's like maps to me - not necessary, but it sure feels nice when I see it.

But more than that, the difference from Alloy of Law is huge. I like AoL, but I thought it was nowhere near as great as the original trilogy. But then that book was something of an accident, so to speak, while Shadows of Self marks the beginning of a new trilogy. And it shows. 

I loved the references to the people and events of the original trilogy, and it was very interesting to see how people interpret them now. Like, this inscription on the Elendel University, in Spook's street slang of all things

&gt;WASING THE ALWAYS OF WANTING OF KNOWING

I mean, sure the books are supposed to stand on their own, but these little reference were just delicious. 

And the Kandra! I like that they're back, as Harmony's agents, and that Hemalurgy is being used again. Part of the reason I wasn't so hot about Alloy of Law was that the magic side seemed to be rather toned down and missing a lot of cool stuff, but that's been remedied nice and proper, especially with the introduction of an unknown element at the end. I wonder if it going to lead to a connection to one of the other Cosmere worlds. 

Loved the non-magic elements too, especially the questions the book raises about God. And Wayne and Marasi really grew on me as characters. Sanderson's writing also continues to improve by leaps and bounds. Most notable was the humour - his older attempts mostly made me cringe, but there were moments in Shadows of Self that were genuinely funny to me. 

And OMG, that plot twist at the end. It's a shock enough to see Bleeder wearing Lessie's bones, but then you realise that she *is* Lessie all along. I was feeling a bit frustrated by Bleeder not just offing Wax - classic villain mistake - but this time it totally made sense! One of the better surprises, and for Sanderson, that's saying something. 

The one complaint I have is that Marasi finding the evidence of Innate's corruption in his hidden safe felt waaay too fake and contrived. Really messed up my suspension of disbelief. 

Still, excellent book, and I'm totally pumped for Bands of Mourning. Good thing it's going to be here in a month!

I love playing Legion Commander, the thrill of the duel you win by a whisker is matched only by the frustration when your quarry survives with like 1 HP. She's versatile, can go any place on the map and has good tools for harass and regen. She offers AOE dmg, purge, in built lifestel and excellent lockdown and snowball potential. Even if you're not that strong, you can buy blademail and turn your opponents' farm against them. 

But the sad reality is I have 33% winrate on LC, so I kinda suck balls at her. http://www.dotabuff.com/players/210476807/matches?hero=legion-commander

Clearly I'm doing something wrong, but despite much thinking, I can't figure out what. It seems each match my team is shit and I lose whenever I pick LC. Obviously that's not true, I am failing somehow. No one is going to read this whole thing so I'm gay. Life has lost meaning for me.

**1. Make a list of your top five *favorite* characters in a new post in this thread**

Characters aren't limited to humans - you can have whatever you want, gods, animals, elves, aliens, whatever. For clarity and help in tabulating the votes, please also include the book/series and the author. 

**2. Multiple characters belonging to the same series are fine. Characters from other media - games, movies etc. are also okay as long as it's fantasy.**

**3. Please leave all commentary and discussion for the discussion posts under each original post**

In your voting posts, please just list your top five. This thread has the potential to be huge, and it'll make it far easier to compile data if the original posts are only votes. In the followup posts, discussion as to choices is encouraged! 

**4. Upvotes/downvotes will have no effect on the tally**

Feel free to upvote and downvote as you like, especially if someone has a great list. That being said, I decided to go with the ""top five"" instead of the upvote/downvote voting for several reasons: You only have to vote once, you don't have to revisit the thread over and over to vote on new arrivals, you can vote once in just a few minutes as opposed to scrolling through a mammoth thread, etc.

**5. Voting info**

Each item you list will count as one vote toward that character.

**6. No pure sci fi!**


Steampunk is ok as long as it's primarily fantasy. A good example of this is Brian Mclellan's *Powder Mage* trilogy. If you think it fits a broad definition of fantasy, then it is fantasy. This rule only really cuts out things like *Star Wars* or *The Expanse.* Stuff that's only interpretable as sci fi. Books like *The Stand* are fine.



**The voting will run for exactly one week** 

Seven days should be enough time for people to edit votes if they forgot a series they loved, and also allow the lurkers that only visit once every few days time to vote.

Credits to /u/p0x0rz whose format I'm copying.

So vote! Discuss! 

PS : This being characters, there's extra chances of errors in cases where I'm not familiar with the series, so once voting is done and tabulation is complete, there will be one day for people to point out errors before the final results are posted.

I mean, calling it Fantasy is a stretch, seeing as the only thing remotely fantastic was Diego's ability to sense his parents and danger. But I didn't mind the lack of magic. 

I liked the themes of the book and the way it handles them - a land torn by war and hatred - religious and otherwise, and a group of people from different faiths coming together, rising above the hatred for a while. 

And IMO, no one character represents that better than Alvar, whose transition from a young and eager soldier, seeking glory, to questioning the point of all this bloodshed to becoming a doctor instead was really well done. 

I also liked how the book didn't spend much time on the actual war, but still managed to convey the brutality and pointlessness of it.

But what marred it was Jehane. She was just so annoying and whiny from the get go. I get that there are justifications for it, but still it felt too much to me. Like, she tells them to not protect her in Ragosa, and then she gets in danger when the two assassins come and she's like why isn't helping me out, and when they do she's mad that they got Ziri to tail her. At every step she's like determined to be annoyed and angry. And yet Ammar and Rodrigo, total badass men and everything, both grow so fond of her, not to mention Alvar. 

Another thing that annoyed me was the final duel, between Rodrigo and Ammar. The book had been building towards it for a while, and it was done really well, but then GGK refuses to reveal who died for so long, even deliberately making us think it was Ammar, and finally revealing that it was Rodrigo who lost. And in that same chapter, making us think Alvar ended up with Jehane, while in fact it was someone else. I hate when books try to pull that sort of stuff.

So yeah, it was a great and sometimes emotional experience, but Jehane kind of ruined it for me. 

PS : Jehane's blind dad managing to successfully perform brain surgery in the field was overkill too. ",Fantasy,Just finished Lions of Al-Rassan (spoilers),https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/3vwhjc/just_finished_lions_of_alrassan_spoilers/

We got early momentum and soon had one, then two then three set of rax down. Megacreeps were on our side. But Medusa had farmed a Divine Rapier by then.

Then another. And another. Now she has ~1200 Damage, and fucktons of survivability with Skadi, Linkens and ult. We just could not push. They just sat near their ancient and rekt any creeps or heroes that came up. Trying to kill her never worked out. 

Eventually they just pushed out three lanes a bit when 2-3 of us were down, and ended the game in one gg push, which was the end I saw coming the moment she had those items. What could we have done to stop this? 

I was the Nature's Prophet. Trying to rat doesn't work when they stay in base anyway, plus my trees were just food for dusa. ",learndota2,How to push against Divine Medusa?,https://www.reddit.com/r/learndota2/comments/3mt6cu/how_to_push_against_divine_medusa/

Shadowblade if I need more escapes, Necro 3 if I have money or they have invis heroes like Riki or Techies. If I see a good opportunity to help - a gank, or spotting the walking cour or a hero running away with low health, then I'll teleport in otherwise it's basically PvE.

Now, I've seen people say that jungling with NP is not good. But how else would you do it? Jungling is great for NP since he can do it pretty fast from level1 with trees, and if you go in lane it gets kinda hard since you dont' have much in the way of damage.

Yeah, I know this is called shit tier and whatever, but I'm finally in 4 digits and that makes me happy. For fellow scrublords, I have only one piece of advice : get rich. 

I though DotA was about fighting and making big plays and stuff, but really, it's more about getting that one last hit, one creep, one deny more that gives you an edge in fights. So just be richer than your opponent and you'll probably win fights.

And the way to do that is of course, last hit. All. The. Time. OF course we all focus on it when the laning begins, but you have to keep it up throughout the game. And don't waste time. That was my biggest mistake - I often stood in front of towers doing fuck all. Now in that time between fights I go jungle or push somewhere else. Just be earning gold all the time.

On the whole, I really enjoyed it. The story starts out as a standard fighting monsters thing - which is fun but hardly new, but then when Eren transformed into a Titan, things got interesting *fast*. I really love stories where we find out more about how the world itself works. 

And of course, since it's an anime, there were some sick fight scenes that were just plain awesome to watch, especially given the superb background music. It *really* adds a lot to the action, IMO. Especially the parts with the female titan were just so nail bitingly intense. Loved it. 

On the downside though, I felt the writing was a bit meh. Maybe it's because I was watching with english subtitles, but every conversation felt like the same - there's this huge danger and we gotta fight! And it got kinda hard to distinguish the characters - they all looked incredibly same-y to me, especially when they all wore the same uniform.

I was the Gyrocopter on the radiant. Things start of pretty damn well - we're getting kills left and right, nice farm. We take down tower after tower with barely any trouble. 

Until we try going highground. We get five man wiped. It was so unexpected. One moment we're all happily pushing, moments later we're all dead. So we say, ok, we'll play better next time. But then we get all wiped again. And again. By this time we're one set of rax down, and suddenly we find it's too late. We just can't seem to win any fights, and from there it's the inevitable mega creeps gg. 

So, what went wrong? I think I was playing well, I had farm and items, I was getting kills. I even stacked ancients with my HoD.

**tl;dr** No posts for New Spring since it's short and a prequel, I'll continue posting once I get to Knife of Dreams.

I've always had trouble getting farm and CS, I often have one of the lowest number of last hits in matches, even where I am ahead and dominating. 

Until I started playing Juggernaut. Getting farm with him is so easy. He has a naturally fast base attack time and attack animation, plus the healing ward makes him harass proof. These two things plus a quelling blade should give you a good enough start so that you can get a Mask of Madness. 

At this point you attack so fast that you naturally get a lot of last hits just by right clicking. Farming is pretty easy too, given the crits and the lifesteal from MoM. Jugg is pretty powerful with just his starter items, since with his ult he can easily take out solo heroes.

I know AM is supposed to be good for farm too, but he needs a fast battlefury, which is way more expensive than a MoM.

tl;dr : Am shit at farming, playing as Jugg alleviates that so I can focus on fighting.

I was Zeus on Dire. I think I played decently well, and the real problem I think was a lack of coordination in our team.

I was the Zeus. Pretty intense match with great comeback by our team. I was playing support-ish, and decides to build Refresher-&gt; Octarine instead of my usual Aghs-&gt; Refresher. I think I got much more use out of the refresher this way, especially with the reduced CD from Octarine. 

But my team kept flaming me for not getting Aghs. ""noob zeus no aghs"", ""lol zeus items"" etc. etc. Should I have built aghs first?",learndota2,Was I wrong to build Refresher this match?,http://www.reddit.com/r/learndota2/comments/3brq36/was_i_wrong_to_build_refresher_this_match/

* Where did the prophecies come from? I mean, Scadrial's entire magic seems to be centered around the trio of feruchemy, hemalurgy and allomancy, and neither of these can make a person capable of making proohecies. Then where did this Terris prophecy about the Hero of Ages come from? Ruin manipulated it, sure, but it was there before that.

* It's mentioned that the Lord Ruler can survive decapitations. How is that possible?

All random match, I was the Sand King on Radiant.

We start off decently enough, but we just could not push the high ground. We tried several times and failed, mostly because we couldn't do anything about the sheer number of illusions the CK was  summoning. I got off some pretty good epicenters, but our team couldn't follow up.
