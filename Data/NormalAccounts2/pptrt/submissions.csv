I can't stop thinking about PMO... It's gotten so bad that I've been tempted to try to hook up with friends, even though I'm in an LDR... I've obviously not done anything but just the mere thought of that makes me feel shitty...  

To make it worse, I'm still unemployed and my hopes of getting a job are being really tested. I don't hear back from ANYONE, and it's stressful... It's just been real shitty these last couple of days.",NoFap,This is REALLY hard...,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/3qh2ih/this_is_really_hard/

It's a song that sounds like it's from a western movie, maybe written by Ennio Morricone? I originally thought it was from the Fistful of Dollars trilogy, but couldn't find it. I can't think of anything better to do so I'll just type out the rhythm, and hope it works!!

I keep coming onto this subreddit just to take a look, but I hadn't tried to commit until now. I know I have a problem, and the first thing is admitting it right? So hello everyone, my name is pptrt and I'm addicted to PMO...  

I'm a 23 year old guy that hadn't really been sexually active up until 2 and a half years ago. It's weird because most guys my age will have had a bunch of sex, but not me... And honestly, it makes me feel kind of shitty. Since I've been single for about 2 years now, I've been relying more on PMO to make myself feel better. But I know it's an unhealthy cycle. I've recently been trying to convince myself that there are more things to life than sex, and I think a reset will be the healthiest for me.  

Any advice for someone just starting out?",NoFap,Yet another new Fapstronaut!,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/3pge1d/yet_another_new_fapstronaut/
