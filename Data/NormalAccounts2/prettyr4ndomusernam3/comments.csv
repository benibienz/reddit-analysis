It's actually quite hard to hack something just based on the IP address. Virtually impossible for private computers (like yours), because they're not directly publicly accessible. The IP you gave is your public IP. Meaning it's the IP that points to your router, not your computer. Meaning, your computer can start a connection with Reddit (after which you'll tell Reddit which port on the router you've opened up a connection on), but Reddit can't start a connection with your computer.

Random hackers can't just watch the traffic from your IP. Only your ISP or the NSA can do that. If either of them want to hack you, then you're screwed.

The one thing random hackers can do without your interaction is finding out all the information there is online about you and using that to attack your passwords (searching password dumps to see if your password has ever been hacked before, trying to reset your password on websites, trying out passwords you're likely to have (like the names of your pets, husband/wife, hobbies, etc)

But if you're just some random hacker, you might just use social engineering. Meaning, the hacker would find some way of deceiving you. Just to give an example:

An infosec journalist - a person whose job it is to know how to keep their stuff safe - was hacked by social engineers. They sent him a seemingly legitimate email which instructed him to update his server's software. When he clicked on the link and downloaded the update, the malicious code ran and he was hacked.

Also, even if you're somehow invulnerable to social engineering - which you're not, even hackers aren't - it is possible to target services you use. For example, social engineers could call up your ISP, make up a believable story and get all your information. ",2016-06-17 07:59:18+00:00,d4csdbd,5.0,t1_d4cp0ni,9160.0,hacking

37,"What *do* you do when all you have is an IP? Here's what I would do (beginner), criticism is very welcome:

1) Reconnaisance. Is it an individual or a company? What kind of infrastructure do they have? Find their web servers, mail servers, routers.

2) Enumeration. Run nmap, identify all their services and IPs. Run directory- and file busters on the web server. Check on CVEdetails that all their stuff is up to date. If not, exploit.

3) Exploitation. If web site, test all the user input fields for vulnerabilities, like SQLi, XSS, file includes and uploads, etc. If all that fails, try social engineering the target using either spearphishing or by exploiting CSRF.
If not web site, then either hope the target is stupid and social engineer him, or cry.

4) Post-exploitation. Download a shell and encrypt it to hopefully avoid detection. Make a reverse TCP connection to yourself. If you got the shell by exploiting the web server, then you pretty much have the lowest amount of privileges. In that case, try to run a script which checks for privilege escalation. If that doesn't work, then I'm out of ideas and will either cry or attempt to social engineer the admin. You could also try to horizontally infect other computers on the network, if there are any. I'm not completely sure how though.

If all else fails, be like the guy who hacked Hacking Team and find an 0-day in a router or web software or something. That's going to take me a few years though.

1) Dig through his comments. You'll find out a lot about him, maybe even enough to pinpoint him based on the info he's given alone. This is how a hacker from LulzSec was caught. He blurted out that he'd got arrested at a particular place at a particular time, among other people. The cops then associated other information he'd disclosed about himself (e.g he likes dumpster-diving) and established his real identity.

2) People usually reuse usernames. If you can link an username to Google, Twitter, Steam, etc, you'll usually have an email and their real name.

3) Use doxing sites. There are websites that give you criminal records, phone numbers, emails, real name, etc. All you need is just one of those and you can get the rest. If you only have an username, you could also look through password dumps. Some of them contain the email you signed up with, which could be used to further dox you.

Yup. Go to 2015. Me making my first game hack. Following a tutorial on how it's done. 

""Well this is the general area where the game looks at how many bullets you have. If you want to have infinite bullets, then you just start going through the opcodes one by one, NOPing everything, seeing what breaks, until you accidentally NOP the right value""

It worked, but it was awful. And I still don't know how to correctly identify what something is.

Infosec professionals (or ""hackers"", if you will) are hired by corporations to secure their infrastructure so that malicious hackers can't gain access to things they shouldn't. You don't trust someone to help you prevent theft if that person himself has been involved in illegal activites. That would be like trusting a cop that has been part of the mafia to handle all evidence related to the mafia.

Government jobs are off the shelf immediately for felons and private companies don't really trust them either.

However, the reason many hackers rise to glory after imprisonment (like Samy Kamkar and Kevin Mitnick) is that they have a lot of knowledge that the world needs.

163,"I think most of us here are self-taught.

In high school I decided to learn programming. Luckily there was a college course designed for high school students available, so I enrolled and learned basic programming in about 6 months.

Then I started subscribing to /r/howtohack and /r/netsec, but found it really difficult to break into the field for a while. I didn't know what to study and I didn't know where to begin. My efforts at installing Apache on Windows failed. I had no knowledge of networking or web development so it was hard.

I eventually decided to go with what I knew and took up reverse engineering. Sadly, I didn't pick the absolute best resources for learning. I used lena's cracking tutorials, which are meant for software cracking. I did learn a bunch, but I wish I had discovered better resources for learning. I plan to continue where I left off and actually thoroughly learn it, though.

Then I decided I really should learn a bit about networking. I did Cybrary's Network+ course in a few weeks. It was good. Wish I hadn't wasted my time on the Sec+ or Pentesting modules though.

The most noticeable progress started when I decided to learn web app exploitation. I started doing pentesterlab's bootcamp. I also installed the LAMP stack on my Linux computer (way easier than doing it on Windows). Whenever I learned something new, I made sure to first implement the bug myself. It's easier to break things you've built yourself.

Now I'm just kinda refining my web app exploitation skills and expanding my horizons. The entire process has taken more than 3 years, but it's been really enjoyable and thoroughly worth it.",2016-05-15 16:36:22+00:00,d36g6cu,1.0,t3_4jg6yo,9464.0,hacking

1) Pick a concrete topic: SQLi, XSS, Session fixation, etc. 

2) Go to hacksplaining.com if I don't fully understand the topic. It's made really simple there. Also I'll read the OWASP and any other sites Google recommends for the topic.

3) Download something that helps me learn it, for example DVWA for CSRF vulns. 

4) (optional) If I haven't done anything similar before, I will implement the vulnerability on my own website. For example, before doing SQLi, I will implement a MySQL database and a vulnerable query to my locally hosted website. This is also useful because if I get stuck in the challenge, I can mess around with my own code and see what I'm doing wrong

5) Read through the recommended reading and finish the module in DVWA.

192,"Thanks for the stackoverflow link, it really cleared things up for me. To summarize:

The problem with using only Tor is that it doesn't provide encryption between the exit node and the website you want to visit (if uses HTTP and not HTTPS). Thusly, anyone monitoring the traffic of the exit node will be able see your potentially sensitive data in plaintext. The idea with connecting to the VPN through Tor is that then your traffic coming out of the Tor exit node will be encrypted (though between the VPN and website it will still be unencrypted)

One possible example of not connecting to a VPN after going through Tor is the following:

You use Tor to connect to an (enencrypted) IRC to chat with people and exchange sensitive information. However, because the data between the Tor exit node and the IRC is in plaintext, then anyone monitoring the exit node will be able to see where you're connecting to and all the information that goes to and from the IRC. Thusly, anyone monitoring the node can see the chat in the IRC even if they themselves wouldn't be able to connect to the IRC (because of authentication or whatever).",2016-05-02 08:33:57+00:00,d2pfj51,2.0,t1_d2p5e1x,22911.0,HowToHack

Also I would think that VPN -&gt; TOR might be bad because if the feds can correllate traffic going from you to your VPN with the traffic going from the Tor exit node to the website, they don't even need to break Tor in any way.

However, what really bothers me still is that in both of those cases, the ISP still seems like the weakest link. ISPs have your PII and also they're known to cooperate with the feds (at least more than some VPNs). So for example:

You fuck up on IRC and say you're from Cleveland. Then the feds can just subpoena Cleveland's ISP and correlate the time of you being in IRC with the time the ISP has logged you using TOR. This would not be a problem if you were connecting to a VPN first.

On the other hand, it's hard to see the benefit of doing Tor -&gt; VPN. In that case, the website you're visiting doesn't know  you're using Tor, which is good since Cloudflare and other sites automatically block Tor. Also the feds will have to go through the VPN first to get to your Tor exit node. However, at that point it's all just the same, if not worse. They can use your ISP to correlate the traffic to you and there's no VPN in the middle to stop that.

194,"&gt;Now there are other ways to de-anonymize yourself (correlating usage patterns, being the only Tor user on your VPN, logging into Facebook, etc), but at least you're not giving yourself away just by connecting.

I like your explanation and the tube metaphor really makes sense to me. I don't see how either of those methods give you away just by connecting, though. It seems to me that:

Tor -&gt; VPN hides the fact that you're connecting through Tor from the remote server.

VPN -&gt; Tor hides the fact that you're connecting through Tor from your ISP.

In both of those cases, the traffic is anonymized through Tor and in both of the cases, the traffic could be correlated back to my IP. Though in the latter example, it would have to be first correlated to the VPN and then to my ISP and IP.

I fail to see how VPN -&gt; Tor equals getting busted while Tor -&gt; VPN is fine.",2016-05-01 21:52:23+00:00,d2ovomy,4.0,t1_d2ov9ke,677.0,HowToHack

The reason I would theoretically prefer VPN -&gt; Tor is because then it's harder to correlate the time of your Tor usage with the time of your online activity (one of the things which got Jeremy Hammond busted), assuming the VPN doesn't keep logs.

One thing he might try is going after your router, so just to be sure, I'd try to look up the name of your router at Google, exploit-db and cvedetails. Also, since you mentioned the game is full of security holes, it probably wouldn't be out of reach for an experienced hacker to get you after pwning the server and your client.

Python is a good start because it teaches you the basics of programming. When you finish that course, I promise, the world will open up to you. So, here's what I would do:

1. Finish the Python tutorial. Pretty much everything you learn here will be transferable to other languages.

2. (Optional) If you know Linux, you can try setting up an Apache server to host your website locally. It's a nice addition, but not completely necessary (yet).

2. Go to the [W3Schools tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/website/) and start doing it. Before every module, complete the W3Schools tutorial on that topic. E.g before the ""Web HTML"", google ""W3Schools HTML tutorial""

a) Law enforcement is investigating a hack and the evidence trails to Costa Rica (either through social media, IP or other clues). Therefore, they will investigate all the known hackers in that area.

This seems like it would be a clear violation of OpSec and rules 1, 2 or 3.

b) Law enforcement is investigating a hack, but there is no evidence to go on. Luckily, an anti cybercrime unit from Costa Rica tells them that one of the hackers there (to whom they do routine checks on) has been acting suspiciously (increased VPN usage during the hack, TOR, etc) and might be connected to the case.

Edit: I'm listening to it right now, it's incredibly fascinating. I've got some questions: 

1. When he mentions that freedom fighters should keep all your illicit activities in ""a junkbox one hop away"". What does that mean? Does that mean blackhats should have a pwned box to connect to? Or their own encrypted box on some network? Or a paid online server? I've heard that in court, if they refuse to provide the password to unlock the encryption to prove their innocence, it's just as good as incriminating evidence having been found.

2. He says to make a fake persona so that if the cover gets blown, it's the fake persona that takes the blame. I don't get how that's supposed to work. I can call myself John Doe all I want, but in the end, it's just another alias, like prettyr4ndomusernam3. I'm guessing he meant something along the lines of that guy who rents a hotel room every time he hacks, so he has to use an alias?

3. The guy who sent defacement code over Facebook - it was a bad idea, but why? It's not like Facebook/police checks if hacking code is sent over Facebook (right?). So it's bad because it linked his personal life with his freedom fighting life, right? And in particular it was bad, because if either one of them gets busted, then both of them are immediately incriminated, right?.

4. Before his arrests Hammond (from lulzsec) had been put on ""known hacker"" lists because of his previous activity. What kind of activities would warrant being put on a list? Having previously been busted? Joining a university's hacking club? Taking part in a CTF? Going to Defcon?

Edit: Since I've listened to it a bit more, I can answer some of my own questions.

2.He said that online persona are good because that way, you don't give out profiling information. He gave an example where Hammond from lulzsec had said in IRC that he was into dumpster diving and the feds saw him dumpsterdive. That served as circumstancial evidence. Also, it prevents geolocation. For example, if I said ""damn, it's so hot today in the middle of winter"", then you'd immediately know I live somewhere in the southern hemisphere.

3.What I said was correct, but I also assume the feds can easily ask facebook for your chat logs if they suspect you.

267,"&gt;But where do you write this, or is it literally just the command prompt and running it as an administrator?

Yes. Usually, it's done in the command prompt. For example, open up command prompt, type 

    ping reddit.com  

Now you know that the website is up. Next, you would maybe use a script, like an automatic vulnerability scanner.

    automatic_vulnerability_scanner reddit.com

Say you get lucky and the scanner finds a misconfiguration in the website for you (if not, you'll have to think of more complex misconfigurations than the scanner can find). It could be

1) Outdated software. In that case, you would open up Metasploit, a program which has precompiled scripts for hacking and run the script that exploits that particular software.

2) Bad programming on the website, like not checking if the user is inputting his own code in the commenting box (this one). So you can type any code you want in the comment text box and when another user sees your comment, that code runs on their computer. This is called XSS. Let's say, reddit is vulnerable to XSS and you've stumbled upon a malicious comment. To demonstrate what will happen:

1. Open up the developer console using CTRL+SHIFT+J.

2. type alert(""Gratz, you're hacked. Now I can get access to your browser and your account."") in the box and press enter.

&gt;Linux/Windows command prompt would know that the person writing the commands/scripts could be a potential hacker.

What. This makes no sense. The command prompt (Windows) doesn't know anything, it just does what you tell it to do. That's like saying ""people who use notepad are potential hackers, because they might write code there"". The command prompt is used not just by hackers, but also by programmers and network administrators. 

&gt;I hope you wouldn't mind telling me or other people where you usually write your commands/scripts in

The reason people use command prompts for this is because from the command prompt, it's really easy to make use of all the programs on your computer (installed programs, scripts you've made yourself, etc). With one command, you can use a program to find the public information about the website and use another program to filter out everything you don't need. Additionally, browsers are used, because while it's possible to use websites from the command prompt, it's inconvenient.

Also, Linux is used very often because its command prompt is much more useful than Windows', because it has much more useful programs than Windows and because it's free. Mac OS is also popular (the command prompts, called Bash, are the same thing).

People use Python and C++ if they need to write their own scripts. For example, if you want to make your own vulnerability scanner, you'd use Python to write it and Bash to activate it. Sometimes you want to automate a sequence of command. For example, in the example at the top of my comment, you could make a bash script that first pings reddit.com to see if it's up, and if it is, then start the vulnerability scanner.

277,"Before doing anything hacking-related, it's really important to know what's going on under the hood of computers. Otherwise you might have a really hard time grasping hacking concepts. 

The two most important things to know before getting started are programming and networking.

For programming, Codeacademy's Python tutorial is fun and easy to follow.

For networking, I enjoyed Cybrary's Network+ modules. Only the basics + NAT/PAT are needed, didn't bother with the modules that taught troubleshooting theory, setting up routers, etc.

So yeah, you're absolutely right that there are many different facets to hacking. I'd categorise them as:

Web app pentesting - everything concerning exploiting websites. This is the most common form of hacking. Includes SQLi, XSS, CSRF, directory traversal, etc. The best place to practice this is by downloading vulnerable VMs (like Damn Vulnerable Web App). For those who don't know the basics yet (myself included), I really like http://pentesterlab.com/bootcamp. It gives you a really good knowledgebase but it doesn't hold your hand as much as some would like. You have to be willing to Google a bit.

Network pentesting - Everything related to infiltrating networks. This is where port scans, exploiting outdated services, dns zone transfers, etc come into play. I'd guess the best place to learn this is once again from VMs and following tutorials related to them. 

Social engineering - The most common way to hack someone. This entails tricking the user to do what you want. Phishing, shouldersurfing, sending malicious links all fall under this category. It's often one of the quickest ways to hack something. Learning SET should help social engineers.

Crypto - related to breaking various algorithms. For example, you can crack hashes using rainbow tables, crack weak algorithms like MD5 (hash), GSM (phone connection), WEP (wi-fi) and various PSRNGs (random number generation). This can lead to getting the password from the hash, unencrypying data transfers, finding out the wifi password, session hijacking and hacking of online gambling games.
Jazzy's tutorials are good for breaking RNG.

Low-level - related to breaking things on the machine code level. Includes reverse engineering, buffer overflows, patching. Leads to remote code execution, game hacking, software cracking (for pirating), IoT hacking (cars, embedded devices). Lena's tutorials are good for software cracking.",2016-04-06 05:29:42+00:00,d1rso2o,3.0,t1_d1r4u52,34364.0,hacking

Both the protocol and media player are, in essence, just computer programs. A computer program is a set of instructions for your processor. For example, an instruction might change a value, like adding +1 to the time counter, which shows how long the video has lasted. These instructions are essentially just logic gates. For example, the logic gate AND produces the output 1 only when both bits are ones, so (1 AND 1 = 1) and also (1 AND 0 = 0). If you want to change a value to 0, then you can simply AND the value with zeroes. For example, 1010 AND 0000 = 0000.

399,"Thanks a lot, I understand it now!

One kind of unrelated question - could you please explain the function 
RUNTIME_FUNCTION(Runtime_GenerateRandomNumbers) to me? It's called from [MathRandom()](https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/264fa75e529562a6f5df97c5daf1867cd81c58d2/src/js/math.js) and if I've understood correctly, it's supposed to generate 64 pseudorandom numbers with a linear congruential algorithm.

I don't understand the function at all. What does it do, and where is the actual algorithm?

Finding the actual algorithm would be enough for me, but to clarify the things I don't understand about the function:
1) Have I even got the right function? In MathRandom(), there is a call to %GenerateRandomNumbers(randomNumbers), but the runtime function is called RUNTIME_FUNCTION(Runtime_GenerateRandomNumbers). It's likely to me that GenerateRandomNumbers and Runtime_GenerateRandomNumbers is the same thing, but in programming, semantics are so important, so I'm just making sure.

2) The algorithm isn't executed in this function. Where is it executed?

3) randomnumbers (which is probably an array of the next 64 pseudorandom numbers) was given as a parameter, but the only reference to it seems to be  
    DCHECK(args.length() == 1);  
which I guess checks if the parameter was provided? I don't see any external calls to which the parameter was given (where the algoritm could reside)

4) some other weird stuff, like  
    CONVERT_ARG_HANDLE_CHECKED(Object, maybe_typed_array, 0);  
maybe_typed_array is only present in this particular function and nowhere else. I don't see any initialization. I don't get how this isn't producing an error.

5) I'm not a very good programmer yet. I don't get what this does.  
    Handle&lt;JSArrayBuffer&gt; buffer =
        isolate-&gt;factory()-&gt;NewJSArrayBuffer(SharedFlag::kNotShared, TENURED);  
What exactly does the -&gt; do? I've been told it's used to retrieve variables from other objects, but I don't think that's correct in this case.

I'm sorry for going a bit off topic, but I couldn't find these things by googling, and it would mean a lot to me if I could understand what's going on.",2016-02-21 19:27:35+00:00,d08drbe,2.0,t1_d08a4oq,5941.0,learnprogramming

If you get a rounded output of 15, then can we guess roughly what the actual multiplied output is? Yes we can, it's in the range 14,5 to 15,5.
