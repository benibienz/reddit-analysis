Usually, you wouldn't be able to. When the server's PHP application includes PHP files they just get executed on the server without the client seeing the code (as opposed to including normal text, which will get pasted to the HTML code for the client to see).

The trick he used was that when having the vulnerable application include the file, he would tell it to encode it in base64. Since PHP doesn't see the base64 encoded code as valid code, it gets pasted to the browser, just like normal text would. After that you can decrypt the base64 and you're able to read the PHP code. I tested it and it works.

The reason I'm asking help from you guys is I can't remember how it's done. I also can't for the life of me find how it's done on Google. If I remember correctly, the URL for it went something like this:

    www.site.com/directorytraversal.php?file=filetype::base64:/path/to/file/somefile.php

I'm somewhat sure it had the words ""filetype"" (or ""filestream"" or something) and ""base64"" in it, but Google turned up nothing. I'm pretty sure I got the syntax of the base64 encoding command wrong, but I hope this info is enough. 

I can't believe I didn't write this trick down, it's so useful. If anyone knows how to do it, I would be so grateful.

Tl;dr: Need help remembering how to tell PHP to include a file in base64 encoding. This is done from the URL bar.

Edit: Not sure, but maybe this is relevant? https://secure.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.php

The new algorithm is quite an interesting one. I won't try to explain it in words (lengthy and a bit complicated), you can check it out for yourself.

How many outputs are needed to crack the state of the generator (64?)? How much bruteforcing is necessary for it? (state1 is xor'd with state0, so that's probably not good, right?)

Searching Google, it seems no one has cracked this yet. I'm not the most skilled guy around, but I'm trying my best trying to crack it by myself. If anyone is interested by this, then I would be very interested in working together with you to be the first on the internet to crack V8's Math.Random!

After downloading all the drivers and necessary updates it worked fine. However, about a day after that (after having installed something I needed) it slowed down enormously. TF2 went from okay to completely laggy. Chrome slowed down so much that it's basically unusable.

Then I reinstalled the same OS. Sure enough, a day later the same thing happened - this time after I installed OSBuddy from the official website.

On both occasions, I copied the backup of important files I have (stored on an external hard drive) to my desktop and installed TF2 using Steam backup. The second time, I disabled all incoming connections in the firewall before I installed every single security update. On both occasions, Google Chrome and Avast were the first programs I installed.

I can't really pinpoint what is going wrong. Right now I'm suspecting either the OS or Steam backup contains malware, but I'm not sure (problems start to arise a day after they're installed). Maybe it could also just be some problem that's not related to malware?

I should also note that Google Chrome seems to be
 unusable mostly because connecting to websites takes ages. Maybe I'm part of a botnet?

What should I do?

On both occasions I installed a  32 bit Windows 7 Home Basic [The reason I installed the 32 bit version is because the ISO was burned onto a usb on a 32 bit computer, and the WinUsb installer said ""formatting iso for 32bit system"" for some reason.

Edit: Math.random outputs a value from 0 to 1, but I don't get it - when you look in math_random,  then it outputs a uint64 (long), which is bitshifted to 32 bits. How is this possible?

My first thought was to brute-force the state. I would go through each potential seed and see if it would produce the following x (maybe, 10?) correct outputs. I'd end up with a handful of potential candidates, which could be investigated further. However, I don't know how to estimate it, but I suspect brute forcing a 64 bit state would take a long time.
