&gt; On the presidential (and maybe applies to the U.S. Senate, too), some math still holds:

&gt;
&gt;Note: Trump is not going to get 90 percent of the GOP base, and with all of those votes banked even before the Comey letter, it's almost impossible for him to win indies by 20. (Romney won indies by 7.) You see his challenge.

&gt; 
&gt; ----Both candidates get 90 percent of base and split indies: **Clinton by 4**, 29,000 votes
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;Note: Trump is not going to get 90 percent of the GOP base, and with all of those votes banked even before the Comey letter, it's almost impossible for him to win indies by 20. (Romney won indies by 7.) You see his challenge.

&gt;###Florida Data Dump: 

&gt;1) With over 4 million ballots cast, GOP registrants outnumber Dems by 16k votes cast. That's a 0.4% advantage. However…

&gt;2) Almost 700k votes have been cast by Unaffiliated voters. And those voters skew heavily Dem, with a 13% modeled partisan advantage

&gt;3) Unaffiliated EV/AV are more likely to be Hispanic (22%), or Millennial (16%), and only 65% are white

&gt;4) Tomorrow AM we will release our latest @_TargetSmart and W&amp;M tracking survey of Florida, including full breakouts of EV/AV.

&gt;###Nevada

&gt; I'll show you what happens under the current numbers if Hillary wins Dems 90-5, Trump wins Republicans 90-5 and Trump wins indies 55-35 -- this is a very optimistic scenario for Trump, especially because half the vote was banked before the Comey revelations:
&gt; 
&gt; Clinton -- 242,000 votes
&gt; 
&gt; Trump -- 233,000 votes
&gt; 
&gt; None/rest -- 30,000 votes
&gt; 
&gt; Half a million Nevadans have now voted -- that's above 34 percent.

&gt;FL Data Dump: 

&gt;1) With over 4 million ballots cast, GOP registrants outnumber Dems by 16k votes cast. That's a 0.4% advantage. However…

&gt;2) Almost 700k votes have been cast by Unaffiliated voters. And those voters skew heavily Dem, with a 13% modeled partisan advantage

&gt;3) Unaffiliated EV/AV are more likely to be Hispanic (22%), or Millennial (16%), and only 65% are white

&gt;4) Tomorrow AM we will release our latest @_TargetSmart and W&amp;M tracking survey of Florida, including full breakouts of EV/AV.

&gt;5) I've seen the initial results, and I can say they will challenge the conventional wisdom of where the race stands. Tune in tomorrow!

&gt;The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program was named for a courageous young man named Ryan White who was diagnosed with AIDS following a blood transfusion in December 1984. Ryan White was diagnosed at age 13 while living in Komono, Indiana and was given six months to live. When Ryan White tried to return to school, he fought AIDS-related discrimination in his Indiana community. 

&gt;Along with his mother Jeanne White Ginder, Ryan White rallied for his right to attend school - gaining national attention - and became the face of public education about his disease. 

&gt;Surprising his doctors, Ryan White lived five years longer than predicted. He died in April 1990, one month before his high school graduation and only months before Congress passed the legislation bearing his name in August 1990 - the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act.",2016-10-26 17:11:06+00:00,d98qhlr,1.0,t3_59ipvw,170.0,hillaryclinton

561,"&gt;PPP's newest Florida poll finds Hillary Clinton's lead in the state continuing to tick up. She's at 46% to 42% for Donald Trump, with Gary Johnson at 5%, and Jill Stein at 1%. When PPP last polled the state two weeks ago, Clinton's advantage was 45/43.  In a head to head, Clinton's lead over Trump grows to 5 points at 49/44.

&gt;Trump was already unpopular in Florida but after the revelations of the last week his favorability numbers have **cratered** in the state. On our last poll he had a net -11 rating (42/53) and that's declined by another 11 points to where it's now -22 (37/59).

Bonus!

&gt;Donald Trump used donations from his personal foundation to establish relationships with right-wing groups ahead of his candidacy for president, says a new report. Individuals with ties to Trump say that he began making “strategic donations” as far back as 2011 in order to ingratiate himself to organizations that might be skeptical of his conservative bona fides should he make a presidential run.

&gt;It is quite shocking that the Miami herald would perpetuate this lie in the face of the evidence presented in my Newsweek article. 

&gt;As the article makes clear, trump dispatched consultants to Cuba in 1998. The invoice, which has been published in Newsweek and is available in the online story, shows that Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts paid for a trip to Cuba for the consultant from a firm called Seven Arrows. The money was paid in February 1999. 

&gt;It was a few months subsequent to that payment that trump formed an exploratory committee to plan a presidential run for the reform party. This op Ed was the first attempt at deceiving the Cuban American community in Miami about his business practices and involvement in Cuba. He continued that effort, lying directly to the Cuban America community in November 1999 about the same topic. 

&gt;The proof is in the Newsweek article. That the Miami Herald reprints the very lies I describe in the piece, allowing trump to lie to its readers again with no further explanation, is deplorable journalism.

And from the start of the plan, every student from a family making $85,000 a year or less will be able to go to an in-state four-year public college or university without paying tuition. Students at community college will also pay no tuition.

&gt;...

&gt;Students will do their part by contributing their earnings from working 10 hours a week.

&gt;A: Thanks, Colin! I learned how important it is to work hard and never forget the purpose of the campaign. In good times and bad, we are here to create more opportunities for more people and make our country better. I also learned the power that each one of us has to organize. I worked with incredible volunteers who had never been in politics before but were leading dozens of others on Caucus Day. Each one of us can make a huge difference in this election if we never forget who we are and who we are fighting for. -RM",2016-06-24 16:28:19+00:00,d4mepgj,1.0,t3_4pngeo,3521.0,hillaryclinton
1548,"&gt;Q: Hello Robby! What can I do to get involved and help Secretary Clinton get elected, besides making phone calls?

&gt;A: That’s music to my ears. We have three important goals right now that we call the “three M’s”: message, mobilization, and money. We need to do everything we can to make sure voters across America are hearing Hillary’s message and plans for our country—building an economy that works for everyone, improving health care access, making college affordable, taking on climate change, keeping us safe, expanding equal opportunity and equal rights, and bringing us together instead of driving us apart.

&gt;We also need to make the stakes in this election clear. Trump is a threat to everything we stand for as a country, and we can’t afford someone as dangerous and divisive as him at the helm. Then, we need to mobilize voters: we need to register hundreds of thousands of people to vote, and then work to make sure they turn out for Hillary. You can help with both of those things by signing up to volunteer: [hillaryclinton.com/volunteer](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/volunteer) to talk to your neighbors and friends and make sure they’re ready to vote! And last but definitely, definitely not least: we need to raise money! We need to make sure we have the resources to open field offices across the country, buy the supplies our organizers need, get ads on TV and online, pay the staff that is working hard 24/7, and more. Chip in here if you can: [hillaryclinton.com/donate](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/finance/reddit/?raiser=2014127).

3056,"1. Until Jan. 20, 2017, it's @POTUS' job to nominate Supreme Court justices—it's right there in the Constitution.

2. The need to fill the Supreme Court vacancy is not an occasion for politics as usual. This has real and urgent stakes for Americans now.

3. Right now, millions of families are waiting for SCOTUS to decide on @POTUS' executive actions on immigration. 

4. Right now, the fundamental principle of ""one person, one vote” is at stake in a case before the Supreme Court.

5. And right now, a case from Texas could determine whether the right to abortion will be a reality for all or some.

6. These decisions could determine whether we as a nation uphold our principles of liberty and equality, or turn back the clock.

7. With these critical cases in the balance, Republicans wasted no time in vowing to block any SCOTUS nomination from @POTUS. A new low.

8. I have news for Republicans who would put politics over the Constitution: Refusing to do your duty isn’t righteous, it's disgraceful.

9. There are 339 days until the next president takes office. The Senate has never taken more than 125 days to vote on a SCOTUS nominee.

10. As for complaints that this is an election year: 1988 was an election year, too—and Justice Kennedy was confirmed 97-0.

11. So, a message for Senate Republicans: Fill this vacancy. @POTUS will do his job. Do yours.

3157,"&gt;PRINCETON, N.J. -- Americans again name Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama the woman and man living anywhere in the world they admire most. Both win by wide margins over the next-closest finishers, Malala Yousafzai for women and Pope Francis and Donald Trump for men.

&gt;...

&gt;Clinton has been the most admired woman each of the last 14 years, and 20 times overall, occupying the top spot far longer than any other woman or man in Gallup's history of asking the most admired question. Since 1993, the year she was first named most admired woman, Clinton has stayed in the news as first lady, U.S. senator, secretary of state and a two-time presidential candidate.

&gt;""She will highlight that Republican arguments against increased engagement are part of failed policies of the past and contend that we must look to the future in order to advance a core set of values and interests to engage with Cubans and address human rights abuses,"" her campaign said in announcing the speech.

* *Hillary's youngest woman president line got a standing ovation with thunderous applause with chants of Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!*

* The GOP needs to stop blaming and shaming women for making their own decisions about their health.

* The Republicans say... I'm not a scientist. Then why don't you start listening to scientists?

* Across the board, they (the GOP) are the party of the past, not the future.

* *Hillary took a jab at Trump for his divisive rhetoric* 

* ...instead of trying to turn back the clock, they (the Republicans) should be joining us in saying no, no to discrimination once and for all...

* America is a gift but it's a gift that must be earned by every generation...

* Today confirms that the equality we've been fighting for has been in our Constitution all along.

* *[Quotes from Justice Anthony Kennedy's majority opinion](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/supreme-court-gay-marriage-ruling-highlights-n382431)* ""No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization’s oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right."" And to that I say AMEN! Thank You!

* It was an emotional roller coaster of a day. This morning, love triumphed in the highest court in our land. Equality triumphed, America triumphed.

* Today is a very historic day...Every one of us is equal...

* Today we say to the families of Mother Emanuel and to all the people of Charleston, You do not walk alone...

* We have to be honest. We have to face hard truths about race, violence, guns and division...
