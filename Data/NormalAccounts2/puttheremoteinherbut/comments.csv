0,"I think this advice is completely irresponsible. Healthcare, tuition debt, marketable skills to push your hourly rate up are hard to come by unless you oversell yourself, you have to sell sell sell sell. We are enamored by the concept of being an entrepreneur and don't talk about the financial ruin that occurs along the way. This may work for some people but a very small subset can thrive like this. I sure as shit would not hire someone aged 30 that was doing ""gigs"" because they are a flight risk and will experience total culture shock coming into a firm. Do not take career advice from a career professor, WTF.  If you have no other job than sure, get a gig while you search.
