More simply put...can I run RAID 1 with two different sized drives with the only draw back being the usable space will be the smallest of the two drives? 

If I'm NOT able to do this....is my only option to have another enclosure in which I can put drive A or B into....upgrade ReadyNAS with new drives...then copy things back? That seems like really crappy upgrade path.
