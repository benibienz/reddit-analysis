$280/4 is $70 not $100.

Staterooms are small. I've never had an issue with not enough storage in the staterooms.  If you like a specific soap/shampoo you should bring your own. Because you never know if the cruise lines provide it (some don't), or if you will have an adverse reaction to it.  

Pools on cruise ships are relatively small.  In part because larger pools could affect the stability of the ship, especially if that water has momentum and is moving back and forth or side to side. 

You are getting nickel and dimed, because the cruise lines have to make money. Your cruise fare is barely enough to cover fuel costs, crew wages, and food costs. Cruise lines make their money with things not related to the cruise fare. (Bar and casino are the big ones).

The first cruise is often a learning experience in figuring out how things work on a ship.  Some of your questions probably could have been answered if you had done a little pre-cruise homework prior to going. But, now you know for the future.

If you have someone who gets to the office before anyone else, and stays after everyone else leaves, but that person is not as productive and doesn't accomplish as much as someone who doesn't arrive early, and doesn't stay late.

In order to make it there and back in 9 hours on a boat, and for you to have time on the beach, that boat would have to go somewhere around 300 miles per hour. The speed of the current fastest passenger ship (ferry) is a paltry 67 mph. And why would you go 2000 miles out of your way to see colored sand?

66,"The dominant rail road track type in the US is a Class 4.  Max speed 60mph for freight and 80mph for passenger.  I think Amtrak runs at a max speed of 79 mph.  The Siemens Charger locomotive has a max speed of 125.  So it wouldn't be able to run on the current track at it's maximum speed.  Which means you would have to lay new track anywhere you plan on running over 60/80 mph. If you had to lay new track would you just lay it next to the existing track?  Are you going to be allowed to do this? I don't know what government agency controls that, but are they going to say, ""Sure, put tracks wherever you'd like""?

67,"If Amtrak loses money on most of it's US routes, why would you go into the passenger rail business?  Unless it's high speed rail, which you would have to lay new tracks for, I don't know if I would go through the trouble.

Also, are the existing freight rail companies in the US going to allow you to use their tracks?  For the most part the rail freight companies own the tracks.  They allow Amtrak to use them, but the freight companies usually get priority.

Would you build new rail stations?  With Amtrak, the trains generally are no more than 10-11 cars, so the pretty much the entire train fits on the platform.  But, if you are doing freight, you could have a train that is a mile + in length.  Are your platforms going to be a mile long?  Or do you just stop the train a mile down the tracks?  (I assume the passenger cars are going to be added to the end of the train) Then if you do that, would you potentially be looking at block rail crossing for an extended period of time? Because getting people on and off a train isn't always a quick process.  Plus you have things like refueling, taking on water, and other things that take time. I guess you can try and design your stations in areas where there is a mile or more of clear track ahead with no railroad crossings, but that isn't always going to be possible.",2016-10-04 21:34:07+00:00,d8e4ddq,1.0,t3_55u4x9,20629,CasualConversation

It could be that Carnival tried for other ports (Bermuda comes to mind), but had to wait to see if there would be docking space available.  If Carnival did not find this out from the port authority until the day before the cruise, they might not have been able to make an itinerary decision until then.

Getting mad isn't going to change the situation though.  All you can do right now is try and make the best of it.  You can try sending Carnival a letter once you get home asking for compensation.  But, the cruise contract is pretty clear on that saying Carnival can change the itineraries as it deems necessary.    Cruise lines are usually pretty firm on that and do not usually offer compensation because of altered itineraries. 

The other problem is leaving from Baltimore doesn't give you a lot of options, especially if you can't go the Bahamas.  Your options then are Bermuda, or up the eastern coast into Canada. 

They might have looked at New York and Bermuda as ports.  But if there were no docking space available, then they have to look at other options.

132,"1.) Don't know, but probably better than a lot of positions. You'd be staff or maybe considered an officer. In most cases staff can be in guest areas when they are not working (except restaurants and casino), and can use guest facilities (pool, fitness center, spa) under certain situations (i.e less than a certain number of guests present) As an officer you would probably get additional privileges such as being able to eat in guest restaurant.  But it might also come with additional responsibilities such as things like breakfast/lunch with an officer, which a lot of cruise lines offer their higher status guests.

Work hours for an accountant would probably be pretty normal, 8-5, 12-9, that kind of thing.  I don't think they would do split shifts, but I am not certain. 

2.) Depends on the cruise line and seniority level. 

3.) Usually you need enough experience to be able to do the job. If you have no experience in accounting, you probably aren't going to land a job as an accountant.

4.) Hard to say, but less than you would make on land for a comparable position. But more than a lot of other positions onboard.

5.) I would say 4-6 months on, 6 weeks - 2 months off.  If it was a staff positions it would be closer to 6 months on, 6 weeks off.  As an officer position it would probably be closer to 4 months on, 2 months off.  Depending on the cruise line, you would continue to get paid for the 2 months you were at home on vacation,  Staff positions do not get paid when they are at home on vacation.

We certainly don't expect to be told this is a possibility when we are booking a cruise.

It would be like me booking an airline ticket and the airline going, hey just so you know an overweight person might be sitting next to you.  We're not sure.

195,"So not sell that room for the entire cruise?  This is what I don't think people understand.  It's not like a typical hotel.  A typical hotel people check in and out every day.  If you need to do extensive maintenance in a room, you can take that room off market for a day to do the work, and then sell it the next day.  A cruise you can't do that.  A cruise everyone gets on the ship and off the ship at the same time.  You can't take a room off market one day and then sell it the next. If you take a room off market, it's off market the entire cruise.

Plus, with cruises people book specific staterooms.  It's not like a hotel where you book a room, but the actual room is assigned at check-in. People book their cruise up to two years in advance.  If I were to book a cruise today for 2018, should the cruise line know now if they are doing maintenance that week?

Even booking 90 days out, should a cruise line know 90 days from now what their maintenance schedule looks like?  90 days prior to a cruise, the ship is usually pretty already fully booked.  Sure there are some people who book last minute.  But by and large the ship is full by that time. OP's upgrade was probably done weeks in advance.  Even then it would most likely have not been known that they were going to be doing work on the exterior of the ship outside that stateroom that week.   

I think people are thinking in terms of hotel here.  Person books a room, and room isn't assigned until the person checks in.  Or that day or the night before.  With a hotel you can take a room offline for a day, and sell it the next.  Because with a hotel people check in and out every day.  On a ship you can't do that.  Everyone gets on the ship the same day and off the ship the same day.  You can't just take a room offline for one day and sell it the next.  If you take it offline for one day it remains unsold the entire cruise. So do you lose the revenue from the room because people will be working on the exterior of the ship in the vicinity of that room for a few days?  And the ship might be in port anyways, and people might not even be in the room during that time. Do you still black out that room and not sell it for the entire cruise? It's not a very practical thing to do.

196,"For that day though what good would flagging those rooms do?  Those cabins are already occupied. You can't just move people around at will.  In most cases you are sailing at 105-110% occupancy.  And they already do that.  If you have a balcony cabin, and they are doing balcony cleaning the next day, you'll usually get a letter in your room, saying they will be cleaning the balconies tomorrow.  Please have your belongings off of the balcony by 9:00 am.

Longer terms projects would be tough to forecast as well.  Let's say you take a room off market for a week, because you are planning on doing some type of maintenance.  The maintenance might only take a day, but you'd have to take the room off market the entire cruise.  Let's say it was exterior work and due to weather or sea conditions they couldn't get the work done that week.  To account for things like that do you not sell that room for two weeks just to be on the safe side? Then that is two weeks worth of revenue your losing.  No cruise line would ever do that.

My experience with cruise lines is generally they don't plan more than a day or two out for things like this.  It may have been one of those we will get to it when we have the time things.  

Again, in this case nothing was wrong with the room itself.  The work was being done on the exterior of the ship.  So there was really no reason in this case to not sell that room.  Plus I find it hard to believe that they were standing outside the room everyday from 9-5. 

What you are talking about works more for a land based hotel, where people are checking in and out every day, and don't book specific rooms up to two years in advance. There you can take a room off market for one day, and put it back on market the next and sell it.  For a cruise everyone gets on the ship the same day, and gets off the ship the same day.  You can't take a room off market for one day and sell it the next.  If you take it off market, it remains unsold the entire cruise.",2016-07-17 21:24:20+00:00,d5g1w3w,8.0,t1_d5fqo2v,17800,videos

That only works if the maintenance schedule is done prior to the room being sold. The room upgrade could have been done two weeks prior to sailing, but the decision to do maintenance might have only been decided the day before they started it.  

I have three cruises planned, one is about 20 months from now.  Is it reasonable for me to expect that when I booked that room back in March that I would be notified of any possible maintenance which might occur involving that room for a cruise in 2018?

The next cruise is planned for November.  Do you think they would call me if they were planning on doing maintenance in or around our room that week?

We've been on a lot of cruises.  I would say about 75% of them there is some type of maintenance work that takes place in or around the room during the week.  How many of those have we known about before the cruise?  0.  You can say, oh it's a simple program.  But, the fact is that it isn't going to happen.  The Philippinos working in the Deck dept aren't going to enter information into a program or a calendar about what they are doing and when they will start and when they will finish.  They are just told what to do and they do it.  They don't care about making sure some person working in a call center knows what is going on.

We don't know that the maintenance was even planned when the room upgrade was done.  Maybe it was something that was added to the list of things that needed to be done after the upgrade was done.

The Deck department might have routine maintenance that they need to do, but that information isn't necessarily shared with the Hotel dept.

Though I would say to get more of the Royal Caribbean experience you need to cruise on one of the larger ships. 

I think of the issues with Empress might be that they ended up rushing through the revitalization, because they already cancelled like two months worth of sailings. So they put it out there before it really should have been. They probably had most of the larger projects done but not all the smaller things. Plus I guess the ship was in pretty bad shape when they got it back from Pullmantur.

I would also guess that none of the crew had ever worked on Empress before. Empress is the only ship in the fleet of it's kind. So you can't take crew from an Empress sister, crew that knows the ship to help the crew that is new to Empress. A lot of the Empress crew may have never worked on a ship before. You have crew brand new to working on ships, and crew that came from other ships in the fleet, but very few if any have worked on Empress before. Same goes for the officers too.

307,"These questions aren't necessarily specific to Harmony.

&gt; what time are the shows usually?

Depends on the show.  Generally the shows are in the afternoon and evening.

&gt;did you get a dining or beverage package? was it worth it?

This is completely subjective.  It might be worth it to you, but not another person.  If you plan to drink a lot the beverage package might be worth it.  If you are not going to drink that much, then probably not a good idea to get a beverage package. Same with the dining package.  If you want to eat at different restaurants where there is a fee, might be worth it to get a dining package.  For me, I would not get the dining package, because I think the food in the main dining room, Windjammer, and other complimentary places is just fine.

&gt;what is the best time to dine?

You didn't specify what meal, so I will assume dinner.  The busiest time is generally around main seating.  The later into the evening you get, the less crowded the dining room is.  But here again this is subjective, and there is no best time.  The best time for me might be 7:00 pm.

I am of the opinion though that I would prefer to prepay whatever I can before getting on the ship.  Gratuities, shore excursions, etc... I think its just more of a psychological thing.  Just to have everything already paid, and not have to worry about it at the end of the cruise.

I know an argument against that is, 'well you could have that money in an account earning interest.' Let's say there are two of you cruising.  Prepaid gratuities are paid as part of final payment.  For 2 it's $189.  And we'll say $250 in shore excursions. For the sake of argument we will say those are paid at final payment as well.  Final payment is due 90 days (3 months) prior to sailing. Taking that $439 and putting it in an account earning 2% (which is very generous) for those 90 days, would net you $2.19.  A more realistic interest rate is probably .5 percent.  Which would net you a whopping $0.55 in earned interest.

That's the argument I've heard most often for waiting until the end of the cruise to pay gratuities and whatnot.  But for me it's not worth the $2.19 in interest I would get on that money by waiting until the end of the cruise to pay it.  ",2016-05-24 19:53:53+00:00,d3i4mby,4.0,t1_d3i3jw3,1404,Cruise

That is what we do.  Let's say we have $100 credit remaining on the last full day.  We will go to the casino cashier and ask for $95 from our SeaPass card.  $95+5% service charge  = $99.75.

Supposedly 58 days is the magic number. On average booking 58 days before departure gives you the best fare.  

And someone will inevitably tell you to use incognito mode.  It's a bunch of crap.  The thinking is that when you keep looking at airfares the airlines are keeping track and are raising the price. It might be $300 one time, and the next time it's $325.  Then if you go into incognito mode, and do the same search it will be back to $300.  

About a year or so ago, someone offered $100 to anyone who could prove this actually worked, and that the fare went down if you searched in incognito mode.  Not one person could actually prove it worked.  

There is really no right answer for this.  If it looks like a decent fare, buy it.  

I booked flights at the beginning of February for a cruise at the end of November for $274.  Those same flights are now $594. Will the fare come down again?  Probably.

367,"I don't think cruise/flight bundles are really much of a thing anymore.  Most people just purchase the flights separately.

You can just google New cruise ships and it will give you a list.  But comparing Princess' newest ship and Royal Caribbean's newest ship isn't an apples to apples comparison. 

Prices are pretty much the same no matter where you book.  Cruise lines have told agencies that they have to sell at a certain price.  They can no longer offer discounts off of the published fare.  Some would do this by taking their commission and applying part of that to the booking.  So if a cruise had a published fare of $2000, and the agency got a $300 commission for selling that cruise, they would take $150 from their commission and advertise the cruise for $1850. The cruise line would still get their $2000, but the agency was selling it to the customer for $1850.

Now incentives and extras can vary depending on where you book.  Some places will offer free onboard credit, or a free shore excursion to entice you to book with them.

It sounds like you would benefit from using a travel agent though.  ",2016-04-29 19:54:09+00:00,d2mhpms,1.0,t3_4h0vae,4227,Cruise

Assuming I wanted to do the same thing with the money.  If I claimed more than 0 to get more money per pay check, but a smaller return, in order to know exactly how much I had to work with I would need to:

1.  Calculate the difference in pay between claiming 0 and claiming the higher amount
2. Take that difference each pay day and move it into a separate account.  So if before I got $1500 each pay day, and now I get $1600, take that $100 difference in move it into a different account.  (It's just easier to keep track of how much I have to work with if I move it into a separate account). If it stayed in checking I would be too tempted to spend it as I got it.

3.  Then at tax time, I take my refund amount and add it to what I have in that account.

4.  Or if I owed deduct the amount I owed from that account.  

5.  Whatever is in that account after that is what I would have to spend on vacation or whatever it may be.

It's really whether you want that money in small increments, a little bit every pay day.  Or one lump sum.  For me, it makes more sense to get it all in one lump sum as a tax refund, rather than a little bit each pay day.  ",2016-02-19 22:10:59+00:00,d06e7mx,5.0,t1_d06bupv,3472,LifeProTips

I claim 0, I get the max refund I can, they send me a check, and I have that to spend on whatever. To me my tax refund is 'do/buy something nice for yourself' money.

535,"I don't buy this explanation and here's why.  

If you buy a ticket from Expedia, what appears on your credit card statement is from the airline and not Expedia.  So if the website is raising the price where is that price being charged?  It's not being added onto the amount you pay for the ticket.  If Expedia is saying a flight is $300, that is the amount the airline is charging for the ticket.  Going into incognito mode won't magically change the cost of that ticket to $290.  Something else has to occur for the price of the ticket to go down. On that same token, Expedia cannot charge $310 for a $300 ticket. And then say to the airline, hey you owe us $10. Because, again the only charge on the credit card statement will be from the airline.  Whatever the cost of the ticket is, that is all Expedia can sell it for.  It can't sell it for more, and it can't sell it for less.   

I believe there might be a service fee on more complex itineraries or where more than one carrier is used.  But, that's a flat fee.  

There was a thread about a year ago, where someone challenged anyone to prove that going into incognito mode affects the price.  And not one person was actually able to prove that it made a difference.  And I've never seen it either where it couldn't somehow be explained.

536,"Sorry, not ARC.  ATPCO or the Airline Tariff Publishing Company

http://www.atpco.net/life-cycle-fare

Usually if a fare changes it's for one of two reasons.  First, the class of service the ticket was originally priced in is no longer available.  The airlines allow a predetermined number of tickets to be sold in a certain class of service (X, V, L, P, F, C, D, etc...). Once that number has been reached then it moves to the next class up.  

Second is that the airlines actually did go on and change and file a new fare.  For example, I booked a ticket yesterday in the morning for $307.  Just for kicks I checked the fare again last night, and saw that Delta had lowered the fare for the same itinerary to $284.  Fare basis code and fare calc line were identical except for one thing, they dropped the fuel surcharge or Q tax.

So if a person had looked at those flights in the morning, and then went back in the afternoon in incognito mode, they might have thought by going into incognito mode they were getting a better deal.

564,"In the past I might have agreed with this sentiment.  If the lane I was in was ending, I was one of those people that would move over into the other lane as soon as possible.  Then I would get irrationally angry as I watched people zoom by me, and merge at the last possible moment.  I would think to myself, what an ass. 

Then I learned about the zipper merge, or waiting until the last possible moment to merge.  Now, I am the one who uses the entire lane that is available and merges at the last moment.  It makes traffic move a lot quicker and reduces congestion. If someone ever did give me a dirty look or honk at me for merging at the last moment, it wouldn't bother me.  Because I would know that I was doing things the right way.

In fact, here in MN, when there is road construction and a lane is ending, the digital displays will advise people to use the zipper merge.  I think it is slowing catching on, and people are starting to recognize that it is the best way to merge.

587,"Cozumel is probably the main port on the Western side. I've had a few itinerary adjustments to Western Caribbean cruises, and they've always adjusted it so you get a full day at Cozumel.  So if they are going to skip a port it's probably not going to be that one. Then you have to look at what day(s) the new itinerary could have the ship in Cozumel and if there is docking space available?  Now, assuming you can find docking space on a day the ship can be there, you then have to look at how that affects the rest of the stops and what port do you skip?  My guess is that you would skip Grand Cayman.  I have no other reason then that Royal Caribbean spent a lot of money on both improving both Falmouth and Labadee.  But both of those ports have very limited space available for docking.  I believe it's two ships at each.  Well if there are already ships scheduled in on those days, they get priority.  That leaves you with the possibility that the only port now available is Cozumel.  Certainly it makes no sense to just stop at one port.  Or maybe they could get in at Cozumel and Labadee, but then how do you create a new itinerary from that and what do you do with the extra day?

Maybe an Eastern run was a better option for the modified itinerary.  Obviously there was docking space to accommodate the ship at all the ports on the dates it would be there. So then it makes more sense to change it to Eastern and doing 4 ports, instead of a modified Western and only being able to get in at one or two ports.

But can you promise us that you will never sail with Royal Caribbean or Celebrity again?

Grand Cayman, Falmouth and Labadee all have very limited capacity.  Falmouth and Labadee are limited to two ships I think.  If on the modified itinerary there were already ships scheduled in those ports on those days, they would get priority. 

Now as far as lobbying hard for everyone you know not to book Royal in the future, that's just stupid and immature.  But, I for one hope you never sail with Royal again.  Because you seem like  an insufferable person.

610,"I think you are confused.  The monitors don't display the arrival times of flights going to a particular airport.  If you are looking at an arrival time of a Minneapolis flight.  That is not the time the flight arrives in Minneapolis, it's the time the flight arrives from Minneapolis.  

For example, if you looked at the departure monitors and saw there was a flight that departed for Minneapolis at 3:00 p.m. and then looked at the arrival display and saw a Minneapolis flight at 5:30 p.m., that is not when the 3:00 p.m. flight arrives in Minneapolis.  It means there is a flight arriving from Minneapolis at 5:30 p.m., but it is in no way connected to the 3:00 p.m. departing flight to Minneapolis.  

Also if a flight is arriving from a certain city, it does not mean that aircraft will go back to that same place.  So the arrivals display is really not all that important.  

There are some variables here such as time of day and size of the airport.  If the airport only has one or two gates, getting there 60 minutes before your flight should be fine.  If you are flying out of Atlanta the day before Thanksgiving, you probably want to arrive 2.5-3 hours before your flight.

Generally though, I would say arrive at the airport 2 hours prior to departure for domestic flights, 3 hours prior for international fights.  ",2016-01-05 15:55:18+00:00,cymunrv,5.0,t1_cymtvw4,1252,LifeProTips

613,"I agree with all of this.  Though some of the things can be explained.  

They stopped doing the midnight buffet, because it became too much work for the chefs, and not enough guests went to make it worthwhile to continue. 

Flaming deserts were stopped (at least on Royal Caribbean), because there was an incident with a guest whose hair got singed when her hair, which was full of hairspray got too close to the flame.  So now, anything involving flaming dessert is done in the back.

They've made cruises a mass market thing. 10+ years ago you would never see jeans in the dining room on formal night, or shorts on other nights.  Today it's common.  As much as I hate to say this, but today they cater to people who shop at Wal Mart. 

Cruising is still great, but for those of us who started cruising 10+ years ago, it's just not the same experience. I blame a lot of it on Voyager of the Seas.  That was the first ship that Royal Caribbean introduced where they really tried to appeal to the masses, rather than the niche market that they previously appealed to.  It was the first ship with the promenade, a rock wall, and ice skating (why the hell does a ship need to have an ice rink).  Today there are bumper cars and a giant crane like thing.

Even for those channels that have actual commercials, the amount of commercials on those channels is still minuscule compared to terrestrial radio.

I could do what you did with Google Play and Fregal, but then you are stuck listening to whatever you have on Google Play.  If I wasn't in the mood for any of that, then I'd be screwed.  Plus for someone who doesn't have an unlimited data plan, it's not really a viable option.

I would rather see SXM stick around, even if it means additional commercials.  Because there really is no substitute for it that can offer what it offers.

They most likely knew that it probably wouldn't show up.  But they aren't going to tell you that.  Because if they told you, that it probably wasn't going to be found, it would inevitably lead to some type of confrontation.

690,"How's it even possible they can't find a toy you left several weeks ago? Are you seriously asking that question?

 Yeah, not to be mean, but this is simply not important to them. This is why you triple check before you leave your room the morning of disembarkation that you have everything. Otherwise unless it is obviously important (I.e. a medical device) you will never see it again. If you leave something the assumption is you didn't want it. On turn around day there are upwards of 2000 rooms to clean in a matter of hours. The room attendants don't have time to try and determine if something was left accidentally or intentionally. This coupled with the logistics involved in getting things back to people. It's just not worth the time and effort.

Depending on the ship as many as 20000 people may have come and gone since earlier in the month. And you are asking them to find a toy you left onboard at the beginning of the month. Just ponder that for a moment. It's quite audacious wouldn't you say?

I'm surprised they even responded to you. Did you have to complain or imply that they were incompetent because they couldn't find a child's toy left several weeks ago? I left a hat onboard once. I knew exactly where it was, emailed them within a few hours and never heard a thing back. That was $25 well spent.

If you were in charge of housekeeping on a cruise ship your policy would be exactly the same. You wouldn't waste time dealing with lost and found.

My thinking was more along the lines of a college female is on a cruise with friends and ends up going overboard, and mom turns around and sues the cruise line for providing her daughter unlimited alcohol.  Or that because of this new policy that there would be in increase in the number of assaults (sexual and otherwise). And that NCL would be named in the case.

Of course I can't really prove that an increase in alcohol consumption aboard ship would correlate to an increase in people falling off the ship.  Or that an increase in alcohol consumption would necessarily cause an increase in reported assaults. Though I think alcohol plays a role in most of these types of incidents.

You just want to sit on your balcony all day and read, you can do that too. I will admit the food used to be better.  But I look at it, like it's a week that I don't have to cook, so I'm okay with it.  

What about the service was just ok?  To me, service has almost always been fantastic.  In spite of staffing cuts, and crew being made to take on additional duties.  In the past a room attendant might have had 8-12 rooms to service during the day.  Now, the number is probably closer to 10-16.  Same with the dining room, waiters and assistant waiters have more tables than they've had in the past.

The other thing to keep in mind too, is that with most land vacations, the employees get to go home at the end of the day to see their families.  On a cruise, that doesn't happen.  They might be on the ship 6 months to a year without seeing their families.

741,"See I don't have to address my boss as ""sir"" and my opinion is respected just the same, and I am not treated as an inferior.  Part of that might be due to the fact that I put myself on their level when addressing them.  And I think there is a certain amount of mutual respect and appreciation that comes from that.  I know when I have been in management positions I appreciated when my team saw me more as an equal and not a manager.  

I don't think I could work at a place where people go around addressing each other as ""Sir"".  It just seems like it would be an uppity and not a very fun place to work.

I guess I follow the adage of treat others as you want to be treated.  And I realize I am in the very small minority here, but I stand by everything I said.

People shouldn't automatically be given respect just because they are older than you.  Getting older is a natural process.  They didn't do anything special to achieve that.

Dear (family/friends/other people who I think may care),

We had a great year here in (Surprise, N.Y./our converted bomb shelter/the first-ever residential submarine neighborhood). After tiring of running around cleaning up after our cat that shed enough fur each week to make (mittens/a sweater/a king-size blanket), we decided to get a (turtle/pot-bellied pig/marmoset).

I researched each animal heavily (on Wikipedia/by asking nursery schoolchildren/by spending a week with each) and, while they can bring a whole host of disorders into the house such as (pica/swine flu/“Alice in Wonderland” syndrome), we’ve decided this new pet ownership is worth the risk!

Speaking of health, aside from (pulling a calf muscle/twisting my shoulder/snapping off all of my fingernails) while (out for girls’ night at a nightclub/trying to ride a goat on my spiritual quest in Nepal/attempting extreme weight loss through break dancing), this has been a stellar year.

Now I know my life sounds exotic, but I really have enjoyed staying home to (rake the yard/vacuum crumbs out of the kitchen drawers/braid my husband’s back hair).

Ahh, my husband. We do love our time together, especially when we are (creating needlepoint for holiday gifts/emptying the mousetraps from the basement/at the urologist for his annual prostate exam). When we are not enjoying a little couple time (wink, wink), it is all about the children: Abby, 2, Marcus, 15, and Jorge, 29. Abby keeps herself busy studying (quadratic equations/the theory of relativity/finding a cure for cancer), while Marcus just learned to (tie his shoe/drink from a non-sippy cup/say his ABCs). We are just tickled, I tell you, tickled, with pride. Then there’s Jorge – the real gem of the family. He’s so proud of his recent GED, he (sleeps with it under his pillow/posted a photo of it on Facebook/had it framed so he could hang it on his wall alongside his She-Ra posters).

When we need time away from the children, my mother (walks downstairs from her apartment over the garage/takes a taxi/flies in from Reno) and stays with the kids for (15 minutes/one week/all of 2010). Now let’s just hope she can handle the new pet, too.

After 18 years of dance lessons (from Richard Simmons’ Sweatin’ to the Oldies/at Arthur Murray Dance Studio in Latham/from Justin Timberlake’s choreographer), Bob and I hope this will be our year to make it into the dance competition (over at the senior centre/on the CBS6 telethon/on Dancing With the Stars).

Hope all have a (lovely/bourbon-filled/death-free) 2016.

Love,

The passenger signed a ticket contract, and by doing so, they agreed to everything in that contact, regardless of whether or not they read it.  If the cruise line would have said, okay, we won't turn you over to the local authorities, but we are kicking you off the vessel, then they set a precedence for all future situations of the same nature.

The passenger claims they didn't know it was illegal.  Well that's a load of crap.  Because what would make them even think for a nanosecond that smoking marijuana on a cruise ship would be legal or permitted? 

Regardless of what you think, the cruise line did not go above and  beyond the screw this passenger over.  The cruise line acted appropriately, and in line with what is stated in the ticket contact, and in line with what the average person would expect. The only person that bears any responsibility in any of this is the passenger.  

Remember too that it was Barbados' decision to jail him.  Royal Caribbean didn't put him in jail, they just turned him over to the authorities.  After that it was the decision of the authorities on what would happen.

Abstract
Objective: To determine whether slow or fast bandaid removal is less painful.

Design, setting and participants: A prospective, randomised, crossover trial was carried out at James Cook University, Townsville. Participants were healthy volunteers from Years 2 and 3 of the James Cook University medical school program.

Interventions: Medium-sized bandaids were applied bilaterally in three standard body locations and removed using slow and fast techniques.

Main outcome measures: Pain scores were assessed using an 11-point verbal numeric pain scale.

Results: 65 participants were included in the study. The overall mean pain score for fast bandaid removal was 0.92 and for slow bandaid removal was 1.58. This represents a highly significant difference of 0.66 (P &lt; 0.001).

Conclusion: In young healthy volunteers, fast bandaid removal caused less pain than slow bandaid removal.

895,"They've actually changed their plans a bit to try and dissuade heavy cell data users.  RW really pushes the use of wifi when available.  

Here is how the new plan works.

You start with the $10 base plan, which includes unlimited talk, text, and WiFi. Then you can choose to add packages for cell data. 

Cell data packages:

* 0.5 GB = $7.50 (total $17.50/mo)
* 1.0 GB = $15.00 (total $25/mo)
* 2.0 GB = $30.00 (total $40/mo)
* 3.0 GB = $45.00 (total $55/mo)

If your phone is 4g capable, cell data is 4g.  That was one change for me, because on the old plan, I was on the $25/mo plan with was 3G cell data.  Now it's 4G.

The other big change is , if you don't use your allotted amount of cell data in a month, then you get a refund of the unused amount that is applied to the following months bill.

Right now I am on the $10 base plan + $15 for 1.0 gb of cell data for $25/mo/  On average over the last three months, I average about 0.3 gb of cell data use per month.  So based on that I should see about a $6.00 refund for the cell data I didn't use, so my next bill would be about $19.

Depends on when there is a need.  It can be a few days or a few months.

&gt;do I have any choice on which ship I will work on?

Generally for a first contract not really.  It just depends on when and where the need is.  You can turn down an assignment.  I had to do that, because the cruise line wanted me in like 3 days, but I wanted to give my current employer two weeks notice.  For that they are pretty understanding. 

But to reject an assignment because you want to work in another part of the world is probably not the best thing. But in about 2 months a lot of the ships will start heading back to the U.S. for the Caribbean season.

If the only reason someone doesn't kill or steal is because the 10 Commandments tells them not to, then I don't know what to say.

Unfortunately, Royal Caribbean has chosen not to pay a lot of these tipped staff, or they get paid a very very small amount.  So the tips are the only income a lot of these crew members get. 

Another reason why they went to auto gratuities is that if you were assigned in the dining room, there was a good chance you'd still get your tips.  But if you were assigned in the Windjammer that week, you probably wouldn't make anything that cruise.  Because people generally only tip in the dining room and not the Windjammer for dinner.   So with auto gratuities tips can be more evenly distributed and those crew who worked the Windjammer don't get stiffed because they were working the Windjammer for dinner and not in the main dining room. 

Even if you don't eat in the dining room on certain days, you should still be paying the tips for those days. Because I am sure that other people still provided service to you on the evenings when you didn't eat in the MDR.",2015-08-14 19:53:47+00:00,cu35dab,3.0,t1_cu34gmt,1360,Cruise

I will say, that the first issue sounds like reservations making promises about the table for 13 in order to make the booking, without actually checking with the dining room manager.  They should have split the party into a table for 6 and one for 7.

Pre-paid gratuities are different then automatic gratuities.  Pre-paid are gratuities that are added on at the time of booking, and paid for  as part of the cruise.  So before you step aboard ship your gratuities have already been paid.  

Automatic gratuities are charged to your SeaPass account during your cruise.

Personally I think they should make all gratuities pre-paid.  That would help eliminate people who don't think they need to tip, or try and get around it, by opting out of the automatic gratuities and then stiff the crew.  Or a couple who sails together, but they only pay the gratuities for one person instead of two.

At this point I am not sure anything can be done.  At least with the first issue.  The only thing I really see here that they can do anything about is the double payment of gratuities (assuming that's what happened)

And for the shore excursion operation, they will probably just make a note of it.  I don't know that they can get your photo or your $30 back.

But they probably won't forward your info on to the ship.  Once you are off the ship, you are no longer the ships problem.  The ship has 3500 new guests to attend to, and does not have the time to answer emails from guests who were on a previous cruise.

Responses are usually pretty slow, just due to the volume of things that they get.  If you're a Crown &amp; Anchor member responses are sometimes a bit faster.

It generally takes between 25-45 minutes to clear the ship.  And then they will start disembarking passengers.  I don't know what order NCL disembarks in, or if they allow passengers to walk off with their own luggage.  On Royal Caribbean and Celebrity, usually that group is among the first to disembark.  

I would give them an estimate of around 9:00 a.m., and tell them that you will call them once you have a better idea. Then just call them when you are in line to go through customs.  You might have to wait a few minutes, but you can do that.  You've just spent a week on a cruise, you'll be used to waiting. 

Disembarkation can go perfectly, and they can have everyone off by 9:00.  Or there can be problems, and at 11:30 they are still trying to get people off the ship.

How do people get toxoplasmosis?

A Toxoplasma infection occurs by:

* Eating undercooked, contaminated meat (especially pork, lamb, and venison).
* Accidental ingestion of undercooked, contaminated meat after handling it and not washing hands thoroughly (Toxoplasma cannot be absorbed through intact skin).
* Eating food that was contaminated by knives, utensils, cutting boards and other foods that have had contact with raw, contaminated meat.
* Drinking water contaminated with Toxoplasma gondii.
* Accidentally swallowing the parasite through contact with cat feces that contain Toxoplasma. This might happen by

1. cleaning a cat's litter box when the cat has shed Toxoplasma in its feces 

2. touching or ingesting anything that has come into contact with cat feces that contain Toxoplasma
3. accidentally ingesting contaminated soil (e.g., not washing hands after gardening or eating unwashed fruits or vegetables from a garden)

* Mother-to-child (congenital) transmission.
* Receiving an infected organ transplant or infected blood via transfusion, though this is rare.

1010,"Don't use anti-bacterial soap.  Anti-bacterial soap is no better at killing germs than regular soap.  In fact continued use of anti-bacterial soap may in fact be detrimental.

About 750 deaths are attributed per year to  toxoplasma in the U.S. (the number would be higher in less developed countries) and half of those are from consuming raw or undercooked meat.  Which leaves 375 deaths per year from toxoplasma.  Which out of 300 million people, puts your chance of dying of toxoplasma at .000125%.  In other words, virtually nil.  You stand a much better chance of being struck by lightning.

1157,"It's not the rental companies responsibility to help you plan your trip. 

Drop it off at the airport, and then do the ship transfers from the airport to the pier.  It's about 40 minutes away.  You could cab it too, depending on how many people you have and split the cost.  

You could also Google rental cars near Julia Street Cruise Terminal, New Orleans.

If it were me, I would show up around 11:30.  But, I would say no later than 2:00 p.m.  Usually if a ship sails at 4, all guests must be onboard by 3.

Honestly, doing this is probably going to cost quite a bit more than just parking at the terminal, and a whole lot less convenient.

United Airlines and Delta Air Lines are not part of the same company. I don't know where you got that idea from. 

United and Delta are competitors. But, an airline will sometimes re-accommodate you on another airline (even a competitor) in certain situations. Which is why the rep had to check with her supervisor to see if they could put you on Delta Air Lines flight.

When you so intelligently told the rep that United and Delta are part of the same company, they probably laughed their asses off, and couldn't handle any more of your wisdom.  So they were more than happy to put you on a Delta flight.",2015-06-19 16:33:06+00:00,csbzur6,1.0,t3_3af0qn,541,LifeProTips

1168,"You can use Kayak to search for flights and indicate you are flexible on days. It will look for the best price with the dates you specify.

As far as volunteering to take a different flight in exchange for a voucher for future travel, don't count on it.  But if you want to try, get to the airport early and let the gate agent know that if they are in an oversold situation that you would be willing to give up your seat.

Anywhere from Sunday afternoon to Monday afternoon will probably have the fullest flights, because this time is pretty popular with business travelers.  But airlines are getting a little better with things like overselling of flights, so it's harder to volunteer and get the vouchers then it used to be.


Edit:  There isn't that much of a price difference between those dates.  Fares generally range from $149-$160 for a connecting flight (Delta, Southwest, US Airways).  About $360 for nonstop (American).   If I were you, I would just buy the ticket before the price goes up and not worry about getting vouchers for future travel.
