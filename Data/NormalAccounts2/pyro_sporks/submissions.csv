It took a few moments for my brain to realize what was happening.  This unknown person went over to the girlfriend's side of the bed, girlfriend woke up and screamed.  I grabbed the person and tried to get control of them. The person said 'this is &lt;name&gt;'.

Like if you've ever had those dreams, where in your dream you try to yell or scream, but can't.

We live in a townhome complex, where the homes all look the same from the outside.  She said guys we went into the wrong house.  She was walking out of the bedroom, and there were like four more girls in the other bedroom.  

As they were leaving, they kept apologizing, saying they thought this was the right house and that the door was open. Which, we do leave the patio door open a little.  As nothing ever happens here. 

After they left, the girlfriend and I were dumbfounded.  Because if you walked into the wrong house, wouldn't you realize pretty quickly that you were in the wrong house?

I have a relative who has employment through a temporary agency.  The agency does not offer health insurance.  This relative cannot afford to buy health insurance privately.  About a year ago this person slipped on some ice and broke their arm.  They were uninsured at the time.  The arm healed the best it could.  In order to properly heal would require surgery.  Without insurance that wasn't an option.  So the arm is only about 30-40% useful.  

He has been working for the same company for about 2 years now, but they've told him that they are not going to hire him on as a full-time employee, so he will never receive health benefits.  And the temp agency doesn't offer them.

In order to get his arm fixed, he is going to need surgery.  In order to get surgery he is going to need health insurance.  Recovery time from surgery is going to be 2-6 weeks. What is the best way to approach that subject in an interview?  As one of the primary reasons for getting a new job would be so he can get health insurance and get the surgery he needs.

Thanks in advance for your suggestions and advice.

They spend all day under the bed, and really only come out at night while we are asleep.  We've had them about 2 weeks so far, and there has been no change in behavior.

Do we just let them hide until they feel comfortable on their own? Do we take block access to their hiding spots?  Do we try and spend time with them each day in an area where they are in close proximity to us and cannot hide?

We also put their food, water, and litter box near where they are hiding, which will not be their permanent spots.  Do we take those things away, and move them so they have to walk through the house to get to them?

Appreciate any advice you might have.

I took out a private education loan from Sallie Mae for $6,995.  After attending a few sessions, I decided the school was not for me, and requested that my enrollment be cancelled.  Along with that they were supposed to cancel the remainder of the loan. (Only about $2500 had been disbursed to this point).

I have confirmation that the cancellation was processed, but the loan never was.  I ended up paying off the entire $6,995 for the loan.  At this point do I have any recourse?  I sent a letter to Sallie Mae (now Navient) to see if they have any record of the loan being cancelled. As well as the school (although the school has been taken over by someone else ) to see if they still have any records from back then.

I guess it just never dawned on me to followup on it.  I just assumed that they would do what they said they would.

Luckily I still have the correspondence from back then saying it was cancelled.  Whether or not that will help, I don't know.

Am I most likely screwed in getting a refund this far after the fact for the balance of the loan that should have been refunded?",StudentLoans,"School said they were cancelling loan, never cancelled it",http://www.reddit.com/r/StudentLoans/comments/3fw8zf/school_said_they_were_cancelling_loan_never/
