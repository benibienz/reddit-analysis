0,"That's rough.  We got bumped off a waitlist in October, and we ended up taking a spot at Little Sunshine.  Everywhere we looked is probably too far south for you, so I doubt I can be much help.  Good luck! ",2016-11-21 20:59:10+00:00,daa116q,3,t1_da9ynnj,2823,springfieldMO
1,"Congrats on the new baby!  My son was born in October and will be starting daycare in January too.  We liked Safe n Sound as well, but they were too far away from us.  Little Sunshine is nice but expensive, and the one on Battlefield didn't have any more openings in January.  My advice would be to start calling places and taking tours asap, because a lot of places are full already.   ",2016-11-21 15:44:23+00:00,da9liu2,1,t3_5e4241,7532,springfieldMO

5,"How big of a loan are you talking about?  The bank is in a terrible position; they shouldn't have lent on a term longer than the lease.

6,"At that rate you are looking for in-home care, and I'm still not sure you'll even find anything near that price.  Infant care is extremely expensive; my son is 3 weeks old and the daycare we have lined up for him is $200/week.  The cheapest we found was about $170/week.  We would have gone with them but they screwed us by skipping over us on their waitlist, ignored our calls, and didn't tell us we didn't have a spot until I went there 2 weeks before my son was born.  My advice would be  start looking ASAP if your child is still on the way, and if you find something that works for you do your best to make sure you keep your spot.  Good luck!",2016-11-04 04:37:03+00:00,d9l3893,1,t3_5azoue,24365,springfieldMO

8,"Yea they look weird, but when you put them in you fill the lens full of saline, and the lens floats on it.  Your eye stays hydrated and they are very comfortable.  You can also get the same kind of corneal shaping from a scleral as from an RGP; I actually get better acuity.  My keratoconus is a rare type though, so it may be different for you.

11,"I understand your argument, and there is no one correct answer.  But  your point about the witness is actually part of what I'm talking about.  You assume the dead witness's testimony is an admissible part of the record, but what if they were never interviewed?  Evidence proving the defendant's innocence may be lost. The defendant can't sit in court and say, ""well that person would have testified for me, but they're dead, so the court should assume they would have exonerated me.""  We can't assume all of the relevant information is preserved.  You could have a case where a prima fascie case for rape can be met years later, without ever resulting in the accused being questioned at the time.  A defendant would not have the appropriate opportunity to gather evidence.

12,The point I'm making is that mental incapacity and due process violations are claims where the burden is on the defendant. It gets harder for them to defend themselves as time passes. ,2016-09-29 15:53:46+00:00,d870wzb,8,t1_d86zxqk,1255,PoliticalDiscussion
13,"I don't feel that your analogy applies well.  Feeding a starving kid does not have a cost.  Prosecuting a rape case is trying to imprison someone, who could be innocent or have circumstances that mean they should not be in jail.  Statutes of limitations are part of a balancing act between prosecuting the accused and affording them rights to defend themselves.  I don't see a statute of limitations as a weakness in a system.  To me it's just showing that the system acknowledges what's at stake, and says at some point the odds of injustice toward the accused are too high.

14,"Your hypothetical doesn't negate the fact that there could be bias against the defendant.  What if the defendant was mentally incapacitated? What if the video was the result of an illegal search?  The justice system tells the victim ""tough luck"" all the time.  A case hangs on evidence that was discovered because of an illegal search?  Tough luck, it's excluded.  A defendant confesses without being read his Miranda warning?  Tough luck, that confession is thrown out, along with all the evidence that was found because of it.  Our system is (theoretically) biased in favor of the defendant because we want fair trials.  A statute of limitations is a part of that.

15,"The prosecution only has the burden to prove the elements of the crime.  Defenses put forth by the defendant also carry a burden of proof that falls on the defendant.  For example, a defense of mental incapacity or insanity would become more difficult, since the defendant may not be evaluated by medical professionals.  Also it creates issues with evidence integrity.  If a confession was coerced or made without an attorney present, the defendant may be entitled to have that evidence excluded.  That gets more difficult to prove as time goes on.  These burdens don't pass to the prosecution as a case gets older.  The defendant still has to prove them, and that could become impossible with the passage of too much time.  We should be careful not to be so sympathetic to the victim that we disregard the rights of the accused.",2016-09-29 13:40:52+00:00,d86v4qz,4,t1_d86tuj1,2142,PoliticalDiscussion
16,"Yes, Mr. Trump's attorneys (or anyone else that he wanted to give access to) could have them.  Trump's accountants prepared the returns, not the IRS.  His accountants have copies of his returns.  The only thing they wouldn't have would be any adjustments the IRS makes.  However, those would not likely be major political or legal issues, unless he was doing something like underreporting income or showing unsubstantiated charitable donations.

18,"I'm a tax attorney, and I've worked quite a bit with trusts.  For trusts with institutional trustees (banks, attorneys, and trust companies), I've seen their fees run anywhere from around $5-600/year into the tens of thousands.  The average is probably $1-3,000.  They vary based on the size of the trust and the amount of work the trustee has to do on the trust.  Also, with the amount of assets you have, you'll probably want the funds invested.  Many trustees will also act as a broker, so if you are looking for someone to manage the money they will handle that for a fee.  

Another cost to keep in mind is that the trust/trusts will have to file a tax return.  They generally run between $250-$750 depending on the complexity of the return. 

Note: These are just general estimates. I am not licensed in PA, and fees may be very different there.  My advice would be to start by finding an estate planning attorney you trust.  They will be able to help you decide what the best course of action is for you.",2016-08-29 22:22:08+00:00,d71tlub,6,t1_d71k0g7,12431,personalfinance
