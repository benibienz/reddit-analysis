I have 2 PCs lined up, and we're looking for a couple more to round out the party.  We'll be using Roll20. We will likely start out with a one-shot or pre-made campaign to make sure everyone meshes before moving into the main campaign.

Several specialists have recommended CXL in both eyes, and one doctor in town is part of a clinical trial that I've been accepted into.  The only issue is that he's never done the procedure on a patient.  I'm struggling to put my trust in someone who has never done this before.  If anyone has any input on whether I should find a more experienced surgeon, your opinion would be greatly appreciated.  The next nearest surgeon is 3 hours away, but I would be willing to go wherever necessary if it would be beneficial.  Thank you for your help.",optometry,Should I be concerned about an inexperienced doctor performing a corneal cross linking?,https://www.reddit.com/r/optometry/comments/3qxjte/should_i_be_concerned_about_an_inexperienced/
