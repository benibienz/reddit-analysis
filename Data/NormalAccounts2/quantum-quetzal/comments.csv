Curfew is another one that comes to mind. In my town, minors aren't supposed to be out after 11:00 or 12:00 depending on age.

453,"If I'm explicitly telling them I am not going to stop, and I'm rolling at 3-4mph by letting off the brakes, common sense should tell them to move.

Telling someone that you're going to do something illegal doesn't make it legal. 

&gt;They're the ones on the wrong side of the law. People have been charged criminally for that kind of ""protest"" in the past, and as I said drivers have not been cited for moving through.

Both sides can be in the wrong. Take for example, someone trespassing. You can't set traps just because they are doing something illegal. People have done that, and ended up in much more serious trouble than the initial offender.

It's not like the legal system has to look at both sides, and choose one to get in trouble, and one to go free. While drivers have been justified in their actions in some cases, they have not been in others, and have been convicted. Being a convicted criminal does not do good things for your future.

&gt;Especially if other people start beating on the car, then I'm pretty sure a fear defense would work.

You didn't start off talking about a situation like that. In an earlier comment you said, and I quote:

&gt;I'm not going to sit there and watch all my work over the last few years get destroyed because I got stuck behind one of these ""protests"" for a few hours. I would rather drive through.

Nothing about people coming and beating on your car there. Just you being inconvenienced and deciding to drive on through. If people were beating on your car, there is a good chance that making your way through wouldn't get you in trouble. That's not what you started with, though.

&gt;How so? I can sit and wait for a few hours, missing potentially an entire day of class, or I can get through in 15 minutes. No brainer.

I outlined elsewhere how it would take up your time. Not making any sort of report would reflect very, very badly on you in court. That could even count as a hit and run, ignoring all other fault or justification. 

&gt;I would call the police and make it very clear that if they don't put an end to it in a reasonable time, I'm going to roll through.

I don't mean this as an insult, but that would be a profoundly stupid decision to make, legally speaking. It would be easy for a lawyer to use that as evidence that you weren't feeling threatened, as you decided to wait to take action. Plus, it's never a good idea to try to give police an ultimatum. They can easily ruin your day, if not more, just if they were in a bad mood. (which they are quite likely to be in, in a situation like this)

&gt;I'll leave my contact info with the dispatcher and give a statement later. Every cop I've known has agreed that if there is a big group of angry people who don't like you, get away from them first and worry about the paperwork later. Unless the cop you get is a major douchebag, ""I am in fear for my safety, here is how to reach me later. I'm not staying here."" is good enough reason to leave the scene.

That is entirely true, but you're still going to have to make a report later. 

&gt;No, sorry. I'm not sitting on the highway listening to professional victims whine and chant mindless slogans for multiple hours when I'm paying thousands of dollars to be able to attend some important classes.

At this point, it seems like you're exaggerating. I go to quite an expensive college, and even here, with an unusually short academic year, our classes only work out to $120 per lecture. While still expensive, you're hardly losing thousands of dollars.

Let me put this quote here:

&gt;I'm not going to sit there and watch all my work over the last few years get destroyed because I got stuck behind one of these ""protests"" for a few hours.

I see no way in which missing a day of classes would ""destroy all of your work over the last few years."" With my experience in the academic world, professors are understanding people. If you were able to show why you weren't there, almost every professor that I know would allow you to make up what was missed. Even if you had to take a 0 on the day, there are only a few times where that would put a class in jeopardy.

That could be different if you have a habit of missing class, or are on academic probation or something similar. But in that case, the majority of the problem would be with you, and not others.",2016-10-27 04:50:12+00:00,d99lke7,9.0,t1_d99kuj5,1366.0,Roadcam

Someone doing something illegal doesn't automatically give you the right to respond in illegal ways.

While this is great for you, and I really commend you on it, it doesn't grant you license to behave in an illegal manner.

And even if you were to do so and hurt someone, you might still end up getting sued in civil court. The burden of proof in civil court is typically much lower than in criminal court, so you could easily lose everything that you worked so hard to get for yourself.

And finally, pushing your way through will likely not save you time. If you felt in fear of your life, just leaving the scene *and* not bothering to take time time to call the police would reflect very poorly on you. And even if you were in the right, you're going to likely have to be interviewed, and may even be arrested while the courts figure everything out.

Things aren't super urgent, but it also takes me quite a while to save. I've shot with this lens for many years, and I've gotten tons of great shots out of it. That said, I've progressed to the point where a few limitations are starting to bother me.

I'm a college student who's only able to work minimal hours.

I do have about $190 right now, but I'm also considering getting a Canon 10-18mm for my landscape work.

548,"Yeah, but there's a big difference between accepting the possibility of an actual accident, and being okay with people deliberately driving in a manner that not only makes crashes more likely, but likely makes any crashes that occur much more severe.

Realistically speaking, many collisions are due to one party's negligence. I'll rag on distracted or impaired drivers just as much as reckless ones.

And as a final point, just because there's always a possibility of a collision, I shouldn't be okay with people flagrantly disobeying laws designed to prevent crashes. That's like saying ""Well, there's always a chance of a fire happening anyways."" while running around playing with matches. It is every driver's responsibility to drive in a safe, predictable, and controlled manner, and others not doing so is no excuse.

I actually really like the second one. There's a ton of cool contrasts here. The blue tones of the sky and water compared to the warm parts of the leaf. The backlighting is an especially nice touch. The only negative that I have is that it seems a tiny bit soft, or out of focus.

I like that you kept the fence line towards the bottom third of the third photo. It emphasizes the height of the trees. I don't know if you edited it any, but the colors seem a bit desaturated, which I think doesn't fit the scene very well.",2016-10-02 19:53:14+00:00,d8b65mq,2.0,t1_d8b5lsl,643.0,teenagers

811,"Here are my impressions:

1. The attention is split between the gator and box, with neither really getting much focus, then. With the way the gator is facing, following the head leads the eye out of the frame. If you find yourself with a similar scene, I would recommend placing the gator's head near the top right of the frame. That way, when following the life of sight, the viewer's eye is drawn into the frame, not pushed out.

2. You've got a decent start, but I would recommend a few composition tweaks. The horizon is fairly close to the middle of the photo, which leaves it a bit flat and lifeless. Try placing the horizon closer to the top or bottom of the frame. Placing it near the top will emphasize the ground and in this case, the walkway. Putting it near the bottom makes the sky feel larger, which I would choose for this scene. It also looks like you're a bit off from the center of the walkway, which takes away from the symmetry.

3. This one is my favorite, and I think that any issues I have are fairly simple to fix in post. The focus is really nice, with the tip of the flower quite sharp. The flower being dead center hurts the composition a bit. I would also shoot vertically, to emphasize the height. The colors also feel a little dull to me.

4. Unfortunately, it looks like this one is a bit out of focus. I would also personally shoot more head on to the building. That said, I like the distinct zones that the bushes, the building, and the trees make.

5. I would definitely have gone vertical for this one, and shown more of the bottom. The empty spaces to the sides don't contribute a ton to the composition, so it wouldn't hurt to lose them.

6. This one has a bit of potential. I would definitely fix the tilted horizon, and then try playing around with the crop, trying to get the subject out of the center.

813,"I like this. There's a nice atmosphere with the different qualities of lighting. The sky gives a soft blueish light, while the streetlight and stands are much warmer. The blurred couple is a nice foreground, the food stalls are good in the midground, and the building and sky form a definite background.

That said, the whole photo just seems a bit soft. My guess is that you shot this handheld, and had just a bit of shake during the exposure. I'd really suggest trying a tripod, or even just bracing the camera against some solid surface. 

I also tend to prefer rectangular crops, since they tend to direct the eye more than square crops. I feel like this scene could work well as either horizontal or vertical, but the square is a bit awkward in between.",2016-10-02 19:06:10+00:00,d8b3tox,2.0,t1_d8b3k7u,329.0,teenagers

There's a lot of variety in what I shoot, from night landscapes and stars, to birds, to portraits, to cars. I currently have an old version of the Canon 18-55mm (I think the II), and a Canon 75-300mm. My understanding is that both lenses are pretty bad, and are definitely holding back my camera (50d).

I'm not sure which lens I should replace first. I'm currently leaning a bit towards the Sigma 17-50mm f/2.8 to replace the 18-55mm, and it looks like it can be had for $400 now.

However, I was doing more reading about the 75-300mm, and I've realized just how low-quality that lens is. I've heard much better things about both the Canon 55-250mm, and the 70-300mm IS. It looks like I can get the 55-250mm for right around $100 used in decent shape, and the 70-300mm for ~$250 used.

862,"I've lived in Northfield for over 13 years, and it at least fits some of your criteria. I'm not well versed in rental prices, but I know that they aren't insanely high.

There are two colleges in town, Carleton and St. Olaf, both of which have beautiful campuses. Plenty of opportunities for outdoor activities, with over 1,100 acres of natural lands between the two. There are also plenty of city parks, even with mountain bike trails. Big Woods state park is only a 15 minute drive away.

Depending on what sort of music you like, Northfield may be a great fit. St. Olaf has tons of Orchestra, Choir, and Band Concerts, and they are excellent. I'm a student here, so I'm a bit biased, but our music program is quite famous. Otherwise, the bars in town often have local bands perform live.

There's not a huge amount in terms of sports, but we aren't far from the Cities, either (~45 minutes), so it's easy enough to go there for all sorts of activities.

The food in town is okay. None of the restaurants are spectacular, but most are tasty. There's a great little Co-op, which is nice if you like to cook.

Now, more about town itself. Northfield definitely feels like a college town, but without much of the party atmosphere. It's quiet at nights, and there's not necessarily a ton to do after dark.

You can walk most places in town with fairly little time. It's definitely not a suburb, but it's not too far from the Cities either. There's a fair bit of local character, too! We have a great town festival every fall, called ""Defeat of Jesse James Days"". It's actually a pretty big deal, with the reenactments being fairly famous. 

There's also a weekly fair on Spring, Summer, and Fall Saturdays, where vendors sell food and art downtown.

Downtown is great. It's quite lively, with pretty much every storefront filled. There are several coffee shops and bakeries, and quite a few restaurants. It's a beautiful area, with many buildings dating back to the late 1800s.

More on the colleges: Olaf and Carleton are high-ranking liberal arts colleges, Olaf with ~3,000 students, and Carleton with ~2,000. Both campuses are fully public, and quite beautiful. Both host a ton of public events, and generally contribute a ton to the community.

Finally, as a nice bonus, there is a cereal factory in town that often leaves the air smelling of chocolate. There's nothing quite like stepping outside on a crisp winter day to that.

Thanks for making it through this wall of text, and please ask if you have any questions or want anything clarified!

868,"I carry a lot day to day, but I typically use all of it at some point.

My backpack is a Mountain Hardwear that I found on sale. It's a year old now, and not showing any signs of wear. 

The computer is a 2015 Thinkpad X1 Carbon, and as you can tell, I like stickers.

My headphones are Audio Technica ATH-M50xs, which are one of the best purchases I've ever made. 

The notebook is nothing special, but I love the pen and pencils on it. The aluminum one is a 0.5mm Mujirushi mechanical pencil that I've had for four or five years now. The middle one is an unidentified pen, but I like how it compliments my 0.9mm Cross mechanical pencil on the right.

The water bottle is a 21oz Hydro Flask. It's got a few dings, but it still keeps my drinks quite cold. 

My tripod is just a cheap Canon, but it's steady and light enough for me.

The camera is a Canon EOS 50d. I work as a photographer for my college's marketing department, so I use it pretty much every day. The lens on it is a Canon 75-300mm.

The thing below it is a third party battery grip. 

Below that is my memory card book. I keep a 16Gb and 8Gb CF card in it, with another 16Gb card in the camera itself. 

The next column over has my cheapo third-party flash that I got for a whopping $2 at a garage sale.

There's a Canon 18-55mm lens below it. It's kind of crappy, and I'm saving to replace it with a Sigma 17-50mm f/2.8. 

Below that is the case for my phone, a Huawei Honor 5x. The thing on the back is a mount to use it on my bikes.

Finally, I have my camera bag, an over the shoulder model from Tamrac.",2016-09-29 21:50:28+00:00,d87hlx6,1.0,t3_554mkp,487.0,EDC

893,"That's impressive!

I am a sophomore in a dorm, but it's a private college. I do have one roommate, I'm on a meal plan, and I'm 19.

Small town MN, so it is quite flat, and there are nice MTB trails around.

I don't actually bike to commute, since everything on campus is within a few minutes on foot. I do really care about biking, though.

I'm average height, but that noodle was a preventative measure after last year.

I do enjoy hiking, but I've never been backpacking.

Good call on the video games. I have a few games that I play quite a bit.

I'm actually fairly happy with my laptop. My day to day use is either quite resource light, or insanely heavy. The light stuff it does fine with, and I use my college's labs for the heavy things (GIS work, mostly). The external drive is for photos and video, since I end up with a ton of them. I use Smugmug for photos, and Drive for everything, since my college gives us unlimited space.

As to the guesses:

* Bingo on both counts

* No animals with me, and my parents have two cats and a dog.

* My parents are actually quite happy in their marriage, thankfully!

* Yep!

* I wasn't, but I worked in the Conservation Corps for a summer, which provided a vaguely similar experience.

* Thin, and half white, half Korean.

* Never really got into either.

* Kind of. I listen to all sorts of music, so there's not really a primary style.

1019,"That makes things pretty easy, since I'm also on Canon (I shot this with a 50d).

First of all,you need to choose a good location and time. You want to be as far away from lights as possible, and finding an angle without including the moon is ideal. In fact, having no moon is even better. You also want the clearest night possible, and it helps if the humidity is low (I had to cut my shoot short due to condensation on my lens). 

Once you find your location, it's time to set up. To do this the same way that I did, you'll need your camera (duh), a tripod, USB cable, and laptop. I installed the free software called Digicam control, which lets me control my camera through my computer. I set my camera to manual exposure, with ISO 1600, f/4.0, a shutter speed of 30 seconds, and a focal length of 18mm. Then, using the software, I set my camera to burst mode, so my computer triggered the shutter right after the previous exposure finished.

If you don't have a laptop, you can get a remote control that plugs into your camera instead. They aren't very expensive; I've seen them for under $20.

Be extra careful not to bump your camera or walk in front of the lens. You'll want to let the camera run for a while. For my photo, I combined about 30 minutes worth of photos. The longer you go, the longer the trails will be.

Once you have all of the photos, import them all to your computer. I shot in RAW, then converted them all using the same preset in Lightroom. If you do opt to process them, make sure to use the same settings on every photo. If you want to shoot in JPG, that ought to work, but it gives you less leeway to correct for any exposure mistakes.

Then, you'll need another free software, called ""Star StaX"". You'll import all of the photos at once, and it combines them to give the trail effect. I won't go into every setting, but it's fairly easy to understand, and I'd really recommend experimenting with them!

Then, I imported the output back into Lightroom for one last round of editing before outputting what I posted now.

It sounds like a lot of work, but it's pretty fun.

A freshman on a Huffy was really struggling on a hill, so I was hanging back to make sure that he was going to be okay. Well, some of the faster students (but who still didn't know the area) went ahead.

I suddenly realized that I needed them to wait, so that they didn't get lost and miss the road back into town, which is quite easily done. So, I told the guy I was escorting that I'd wait up, and sprinted ahead, trying to catch the other riders. 

Well, I guess that I shouldn't have eaten such a large and rich meal before hand, because I catch up, get to the top, and take a breather. Everyone catches up, and I start to feel really shitty, and then vomit all over my bike.

1063,"Here's my first takes on every photo:

1. There's not enough dynamic range. Maybe try dropping the shadows a bit. The crop is also a little boring. What is the subject?

2. The exposure seems fine, but it looks like there's a bit of a green color cast. Also, once again, the composition seems a little lifeless. Try playing around with some different crops.
 
3. This is a nice shot of spinning wool, but beyond the interesting technique, there's not much interesting going on. Also, the highlights look a bit overexposed.

4. The range of tones is great. There's everything from nice highlights, to dark shadows, without things feeling too imbalanced. That said, once again, I feel like the composition is a bit dead. The horizon and headlight are both centered, which leaves little visual tension. 

5. While this is a good practice for light painting, it leaves a bit to be desired. While you're following the rule of thirds better, the light isn't particularly interesting, and the side of the car looks unnaturally lit. If you get another chance, try shielding it from your light source.

6. This shot is much better than the other spinning wool, but there's still not much interesting beyond the wool itself.

7. I like the composition on this one, but something feels off about the tones present in the black and white. The shadows aren't quite dark enough, in my opinion.

8. Way too dark, and the subject is near the dead center of the frame. You also have what looks like something intruding from the left.

9.This looks pretty much the same as number 5, and I leave the same critique.

10. The best of the spinning wool, in my opinion. There's more going on, what with the equipment. Maybe try bringing the midtones up slightly, though.

The first sentence of that abstract:

&gt;Modern climate change is dominated by human influences, which are now large enough to exceed the bounds of natural variability.

http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/abs/ha00110y.html

&gt;Our climate model, **driven mainly by increasing human-made greenhouse gases and aerosols among other forcings**, calculates that Earth is now absorbing 0.85±0.15 W/m2 more energy from the Sun than it is emitting to space.

(emphasis mine)

http://science.sciencemag.org/content/292/5515/270

&gt;the chances of either the anthropogenic or observed signals being produced by the PCM as a result of natural, internal forcing alone are less than 5%

http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v407/n6804/abs/407617a0.html

&gt;We expect global mean temperatures in the decade 2036–46 to be 1–2.5 K warmer than in pre-industrial times under a 'business as usual' emission scenario.

http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2004JD005075/full

&gt;The spatial pattern of height increase is consistent with climate model predictions of the expected response to anthropogenic influences alone, significantly strengthening earlier detection results.

Right as we were coming back onto campus, a few people from the cross-country running team pass us on road bikes, and I get a snarky ""try harder next time"". I guess that they thought that I was some casual rider who just happened to have a road bike. I can't stand for that! After they pass, I put every watt down that I could. I went from the 7 or 8 mph that we were at, to the runner's 15 or 16, to 35mph.

I can't suggest trying out manual modes enough. Maybe start off using it alongside the automatic modes? If worst comes to worst, you just have photos that didn't turn out. The single most important tip that I can offer is to take a ton of photos. There are so many factors that are outside of your control, especially with wildlife photography. Taking a ton of shots maximizes your chances of getting a great photo. I can easily take a few thousand shots in one large shoot, and I usually only end up with one or two dozen really good photos.

I'd also not recommend it if you have a lot of long distance or city driving on a regular basis.

However, if you live somewhere temperate, don't drive very far on a regular basis, and are comfortable working on it yourself, I'd say to look into it more.

2391,"Overall, these look really nice! I do have some suggestions, though.

My first one is just directed to the album in general. When you're putting together a portfolio to show off your work, you should aim to cut down on the number of very similar shots. While the shots of the moon are cool, you should aim to have only one or two, since they are so similar. Having fewer shots of the same thing makes your portfolio more compact, and it shows off a variety of your work better.

Now, with regards to the photos themselves. Whenever you take a shot, ask yourself what the subject is. Then, think about how that works in the photo. For example, when you look at [this photo](http://i.imgur.com/ppJcfWp.jpg), it's obvious that your subject is the airplane. However, it only takes up a tiny bit of the frame, and the rest is just dead space. That makes the shot a bit boring. [This photo](http://i.imgur.com/o9n42DL.jpg) doesn't have a clear subject to me. What is it that you are trying to show?

Finally, you can look at the technical aspects of the photos.I like the subject and the framing in [this photo](http://i.imgur.com/4MgIcxv.jpg), but it seems a bit overexposed (too bright). You can correct this in-camera if you have manual settings. If not, or if you got those settings wrong, there is some amount of corrections that can be made in post. However, it's always better to try to do that in camera, as post has more limitations.

Please let me know if you have any questions! I'm actually a professional photographer, and I'd love to help other people get into the art.

* Some Saturn sedan. Red. We don't really talk about this mistake. It was sold to make room for the next car.

* 6th Gen Honda Accord. Blue. This car replaced the Saturn. It was also totalled in the same storm that did the Civic, but we got rid of it. It had sat full of water under a tarp for a few days before the insurance adjuster got to it.

* 2007 Honda Civic. Light Blue. This car replaced the Accord. It's still going strong today, despite seeming slightly cursed. It's had three new bumpers, courtesy of other drivers, along with a new quarter panel twice. Never our fault, or even avoidable, though.

* 2015 Subaru Forester. Red. This replaced our oldest Civic. We found that we were renting small SUVs very frequently, so we got one to replace the old beater.

My laptop has the same footprint, and is only 0.5mm thicker, yet it manages to have a 14"" screen where the air has a 13"" screen. It's even a tenth of a pound lighter.

Speaking of screens, the massive bezel on the Air is hardly ""up to date"". Just look at the Dell XPS 13 for something that is actually progressing, rather than staying pretty much the same since 2008.

I like the symmetry of the buildings on either side. I feel like the effect could be a little more powerful if you had stepped more towards the middle of the road.

Also, it looks like the photo is ever so slightly tilted. That's a super easy fix, though, and can easily be taken care of.

Then there are the technical parts. Since I assume that you don't have a very fancy camera or software, you're a bit limited in what you can do. Still, hopefully this can give you an idea of what to think about.

The sky is obviously blown out, and the buildings are in shadow.This actually serves to highlight the car down the road, which is a pretty cool effect. However, if your goal was to capture the buildings themselves, it's not perfect. If you have any way of brightening the shadows, it could do a lot for this photo.

2870,"Sure!

Camera should be plenty obvious. My camera is an upper-consumer range model from Canon.

My camera has interchangeable lenses. When you refer to ""focal length"", it's just a way to easily compare zoom. This lens has a fairly large zoom, but I was using it at the wiser end.

The exposure refers to how long light is measured for a photo. The shorter that the time is, the better it freezes motion. It takes more light to take a shorter photo, though.

Every camera lens has an opening called an aperture. It can change diameter to let more or less light through. the f just refers to a standard measurement. Somewhat counter-intuitively, the lower the number, the larger the opening, and the more light is let through. Also, the background gets blurred more at lower numbers.

ISO is a standard measurement of how sensitive your camera's sensor is. The higher the number, the less light you need, but the image quality is lower.

Writing this all up lets other photographers know what settings I was using, so that they can try to get a similar shot if they want.

My parents told me that I would have to save up my own money to buy one myself. I saved all summer, and my parents helped me pick out a great camera in my budget.

I decided that I wanted to know how to use it well, so I checked out a ton of books from the library, and spent a ton of time reading over them. You know, composition, and other fairly basic stuff.

Since then, I've upgraded from that little $100 compact to a Canon Digital Rebel XT, to my current camera, a Canon EOS 50d.

My biggest tip to anyone starting out is to take a shit ton of photos. If you're shooting digital, it doesn't cost any more to take 100 photos than it does 1. Try all sorts of angles and funky compositions. Don't get frustrated when some don't turn out. That photo on my desktop is one out of *1500* from that evening alone.

If the infringer has removed your copyright management information, such as your name, contact information, or copyright notice, from your work in an attempt to facilitate or conceal its infringement, the infringer may have violated the DMCA. Section 1202(b) of the DMCA prohibits the removal of “copyright management information” in certain circumstances. It states in pertinent part:

&gt;No person shall, without the authority of the copyright owner or the law—(1) intentionally remove or alter any copyright management information . . . . knowing, or, with respect to civil remedies . . . having reasonable grounds to know, that it will induce, enable, facilitate, or conceal an infringement of any right under this title.

There are tons of potential uses for insurance. Accidents happen.

I don't think that it's fair to compare firearm deaths to vehicle deaths.

Now, of course there are instances where using a gun in self defense is more than justified, but there are also times where people should not have used guns in the way that they did.

Besides, vehicles are used much more frequently by  a much larger portion of the population, so of course there will be more deaths than guns.

I'm actually racing, so I'm required to wear a helmet. We move much faster than any Dutch commuter on their omafiets, and we take turns much more aggressively. As a result, even a very experienced rider will find them self falling occasionally.

Dear god, is racing gear expensive. My bike was ~$2,500 new (adjusted for inflation), but I bought it used for $500. My clothes were all on sale, but still ended up costing well over $200. Even just nice road shoes can be a few hundred on their own.

We usually go very far on our rides, and can't really walk home. Not only can I end up 20 or 30 miles from home, but the shoes that are compatible with my pedals can actually be ruined by walking in them for too long. It's just a good idea to have tools with so that you don't have to cut your ride short. 

Warming up is critical for workouts. Otherwise, you can end up hurting yourself. I wouldn't bother for a commute, but it's pretty essential for my training rides.

3621,"I've only really been using the internet seriously for the past decade or so. However, I don't think that that is actually very relevant, given the pace at which the internet changes. Sure, the internet hasn't always had many ads. However, websites are generally much more complex now, and therefore more expensive to create and maintain. There are also many more visitors, which bring about much more expensive server costs. 

Plus, many websites (such as news sites) have much less of a connection to other forms of media. Because of that, they have to stand on their own. They have to make money somehow, and ads are currently the most popular way to do that. I can't think of ways to make money aside from ads without instituting a paywall, which is much more obnoxious in my mind.

Sure, some parts of the internet work just fine as a community effort. However, without money as a driving factor, it wouldn't be anywhere near as large as it is today. So many people just wouldn't bother. So, I think that in most cases, it's less ""greedy shitheads"", and more business minded people.

If the fuck up with the ads, like with malware or other obnoxious tactics, I'll block them. Otherwise, I think that they deserve the fractions of a penny that they get from my views. Why should they work for free?

3739,"So, to start off, I'm assuming that you don't have a ton of knowledge about bikes, so please excuse me if I seem condescending. Also, I hope that you don't mind a wall of text.

I was actually in a very similar boat to you starting out! A few months before my 17th birthday, I decided that I wanted to buy a road bike. I contacted someone in my local cycling club, and asked if there was anyone who would be willing to let me try out a road bike, so that I could know if I actually wanted to buy one. Someone loaned me a 1999 Litespeed Classic (a really nice bike) for a month and a half.

Do you have any clubs that you could contact? I wouldn't go in expecting an outcome like mine, but it's always worth a try. At the very least, go to your local bike shop and see if they would be willing to let you test ride. They might be able to help you find a club as well. 

Now, with your age, I'm assuming that you are on a somewhat limited budget, much like I was. If that is the case, going used might be a good idea for you. IMO, it's better to have an older, higher-end bike than a new, lower-end one. Craigslist is a good place to look, so long as you are comfortable with taking on some amount of risk. 

If you do go this route, *take your time*, and *do your research*. Craigslist is somewhat notorious for having a ton of overpriced crap. However, if you're willing to sift through all of it, you can come out really well. Here's the strategy that I used to find my Kleins, both of which I found on Craigslist:

* Start by searching for ""road"". This doesn't need much explaining. 

* Set a minimum price. Set it to be a bit less than  what the minimum that you would actually want to pay. Who knows, maybe you'll find a great deal. Let's say that you have around $500 to spend. I'd recommend a minimum around $300.
* Set a maximum price. Keep in mind that negotiation is a big part of the buying process, so this can be quite a bit higher than what you want to pay. If you have $500, I'd recommend a max of $750, or even $800. If you ask someone to lower their price, the worst that could happen would be them saying ""no"".
* Only include posts with photos. It's next to impossible to judge anything by a description alone. Any motivated and responsible seller will post photos. Also try to avoid posts which only have stock photos of the bike.
*If a bike catches your eye, do some research on it. I really recommend [Bicycle Blue Book](http://www.bicyclebluebook.com/) (BBB). It's not infallible, but it is a good way to ballpark the value of a bike. Keep in mind that bikes depreciate, even if they aren't being ridden. Pay attention to any parts that aren't stock. Check to see whether they're nicer or cheaper than what was originally on the bike.
* If anything seems sketchy at any point, move on. It's better to trust your gut here.

So, lets say that a bike catches your eye. Send an email or text to the seller. Try not to come across as too interested, even if the bike seems like a dream come true. You don't want to give away any bargaining leverage. If the bike is a bit above your range, see if they would be willing to consider a number a bit below your max. They may not be willing to bargain, in which case you should move on. It might be hard, but it's better than letting emotion take over. If the bike falls into your range, try to set up a time to meet. There's a whole new procedure to go through when setting up a test.

* Determine if you are comfortable inspecting the bike yourself, or if you want someone else to do it. If you aren't comfortable, call around to bike shops around the seller, asking if they do general inspections. You might have to pay a bit of money, but it's worth the peace of mind that it can bring. I did this when I bought my mountain bike, and it was only $20. 
* I'd suggest trying to get someone else to come with you. There's always a small risk with meeting someone from Craigslist, but it's much safer if you bring a friend or parent. 
*Figure out what payment method you would use if you decide on the bike. I've made three big purchases on Craigslist, and I've paid with a different method each time. I've used a credit card with the Square app (don't expect a seller to have this), a Paypal transfer, and straight cash. If you do decide on cash, see if there's a bank nearby where you could get cash after coming to an agreement. It's generally a good idea to avoid carrying large amounts of cash, especially for a Craigslist meeting.

Let's assume that the bike checks out mechanically. If you want some tips on how to inspect it yourself, let me know. Now, it's time for the test ride. In general, make sure that everything feels ""right"". Here's a brief list of what to look for:

* Does the bike shift cleanly and precisely?
* Are there any weird creaks, squeaks, or rattles?
* Does it handle right? Are there any weird wobbles?
*Does it just feel ""right""? Sorry for the ambiguous phrasing, but there's a certain sum of a bunch of tiny qualities that you'll know when you see it.

So, if you decide that you want the bike, go ahead and make an offer! If you can come to a good price, great! If you can't get it to the range that you want, don't be afraid to walk away. It's hard to do, but it's better than getting ripped off, or even just spending more than you can afford.

Now, of course you can buy a bike from a shop. There won't be much of a difference between new or used, at least in terms of the buying process. Still follow the test ride procedure. You can even still try to negotiate, but there's usually less wiggle room than on Craigslist.

So, you've finally bought a bike! Now, get out and get used to it! It'll be weird getting used to at first, but it'll become normal before you know it. At least for the first little bit, you can manage without specialized clothes. You will definitely want them eventually, but it's alright to wait a little bit.

Do all that you can to find a club to ride with. Your bike shop will be a great place to start. If you are able to find one, go on as many rides as you can! Pay close attention to what others say to you; they should know what they're talking about!

So, best of luck! Hopefully you made it all of the way through this post! If you have any questions, or need any clarification, please feel free to message me at any time. Keep us updated!

I'll apologize for the low-quality photo in advance; I only had my GoPro with me.

I'm so happy, because it's warm enough here in MN to take my baby back out. So far this week I've put about 70 miles on it. My first race is in just over two weeks, and I'm psyched for it!

I have had this bike since August 2014, when I bought it third-hand on Craigslist. Everything is stock except for the saddle. Its groupset is full 105 5500. 

It's really hard to tell in any photo, let alone this one, but its paint is absolutely gorgeous. Its mainly purple and green, but the right light can bring out any color, from lime green to sky blue, to a deep scarlet. I have never been on a group ride without multiple people commenting on it, and I absolutely love that. Here's a photo that shows of the paint better: http://i.imgur.com/VsDbBvu.jpg

I would like to modernize the groupset and wheels at some point, most likely bringing it up to modern 105. I'm not in too much of a hurry, though, as it's pretty good for the type of riding that I do now.

This is the first really nice bike that I ever bought, and it means the world to me. My apologies for waxing poetic, but I feel a remarkably strong connection to this bike. It may not be the latest or greatest, but it is more than I ever expected from a 16 year old bike.

I'm boycotting Trek bikes. They bought out Klein bikes back in the late 90s, and eventually killed them off in the mid 2000s.

Even now, my relative low-end models of theirs get a ton of attention from other cyclists, due to the history of the company.

This is a bit different from electricity, because this is just the observation of a wave, and not the creation of one. It could still be a fairly long time before scientists are even capable to creating one in the lab, let alone working it into a useful product. The energy required for such a tech would be mind-boggling. I get that the event detected was very far away, but it took three times the mass of the sun being converted into energy to produce this wave, and even then, the strain was around 1x10^-21. To put that in perspective, that strain translates to only 0.00015mm over an entire AU (the distance from the Earth to the sun). The energy required was ~5x10^47 J, or 2.5x10^30 *times* the energy released by the Tsar Bomb, the largest nuke ever detonated, or the same as the amount of energy contained in ~4x10^39 gallons of gasoline. That's around 4x10^27 cubic miles of gasoline, or a sphere 1.3 million miles in diameter.
