I don't think that any of those people are photographers, designers, or marketers, but they got me thinking. Is that the sort of thing that's ever done? If it is, is that photo worth it? And if it is, how would I go about doing that?

Over the years, I've added many things to my kit, sometimes replacing earlier things. The first to change was the body, after the shooting info LCD died. It came back to life several months later, but by then I had already bought my current 50d. 

Last week, I finally replaced the lens, after I got a barely-touched 18-55 f/3.5-5.6 IS II for $40 from a friend. It's not a huge upgrade, but it's not too bad for a college sophomore. 

I just realized that the only piece of my original kit left in my camera bag is the lens hood for that lens, and it's a bit weird to think about.

There wasn't a ton of point in sharing this, but I thought that this sentiment might be appreciated more in a community of photographers, than if I just shared it with my friends.",photography,"I just replaced the last major piece of my first DSLR kit, and I'm oddly emotional.",https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/59zbo9/i_just_replaced_the_last_major_piece_of_my_first/

Our moms worked together, and our families were great friends. We did all sorts of stuff together, and were pretty much inseparable. When I was about to turn six, my family moved across the country. We saw each other twice afterwards, the last time being right before I turned ten. Since then, we fell out of touch, and I heard nothing from her.

That is, until this last Monday, when I got a friend request from her on Facebook. I'm now almost 19, but I never really forgot about her. It turns out that she had recently joined FB, which explains why I had trouble finding her before.

I message her pretty much immediately, just asking about how she's been. Time starts to just fly by, as we begin catching up. I almost forgot to go get dinner, I was so excited to talk to her. We messaged each other for well over five hours, until it was after 1am her time. We went to bed with the promise to Skype the next day.

The next day, we Skyped for over two hours. Even though so much had changed, we still had a ton in common. We spent quite a while talking through our memories of each other, which were vivid enough that we could complete each other's sentences. I have a photo of the two of us together up in my bedroom at home, and it turns out that she does as well.

I might even get the chance to see her next year! Her parents are alumni of a college in my town, and a big reunion is coming up for them. I can hardly contain my excitement at the chance of seeing her again! No matter how everything goes, I don't intend on falling out of touch again.",happy,I found one of my best childhood friends almost nine years after we last saw each other!,https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/4khkcg/i_found_one_of_my_best_childhood_friends_almost/

Birds chirp in the distance. A squirrel skitters its way up a nearby maple, disappearing among the golden leaves. My bike crunches its way through the fallen leaves, with only the sound of the well oiled chain and my steady breathing to accompany it. I speed up, clicking through my gears. The derailleur clacks for a fraction of a second, dropping into gear as it has done thousands of times before. My bike crests the hill as I come to a stop. The suspension bobs as I unfold myself from my mechanical steed.

These woods do a remarkable job of concealing any sort of human influence. Despite having been raked clean a few days ago, the meandering singletrack is almost completely out of sight, buried through the relentless advance of Autumn. Winter is on its way, and wishes to make itself known. There’s a chilly edge to the air, hiding from the golden rays of sun breaking through the canopy. Given a few more weeks, the leaves will be but a memory, and snow will be much more of an imminent reality.

Still, I like to live in the moment. I break out of my trance, and kick my right leg over the saddle and onto my pedal. One quick push and I’m rolling forward, watching the lip of the drop approaching. I stand on the pedals, pushing down with every fiber of my being, willing one last watt out of my shaking legs. The edge beckons. Over I go. For a glorious moment I’m falling, gravity taking over for my calves and thighs, their work done for now.

The ground pushes back. The feeling of weightlessness is gone, now replaced with a relentless push upwards. A brief wobble of the front wheel, and I crest the opposite edge. Gravity rushes to catch up, but has been temporarily left behind. Both wheels leave the ground, and I’m airborne. Time slows and I savor the feeling of power that I hold. I have turned gravity against itself using only my own two legs. In its rush to pull me in, it has forgotten about the opposite rim. I fly free, lofting my Klein over the tangled mess of branches and weeds. The model, Attitude, fits my mood perfectly. I’m working against the most basic physical forces, sticking it to some abstract version of “The Man”. Attitude indeed. I am no downhill master - soaring over massive cliffs and canyons, seemingly defying the very laws of nature, but it feels just as good to me.

Alas, I am but a mere mortal, and any dreams of cosmic defiance are just that - dreams. My rear wheel crunches back down, dragging through the leaves. The front kisses the ground before the rebound sends it skyward once more. It touches down again, this time for good. My hand clenches around the right lever, swinging the rear brake pads towards the rim. Friction between the pads and the rim increases until it overcomes momentum. The wheel slams to a halt, ignoring the protests of the gravel underneath. I throw my weight to the left, swinging the back wheel around. Gravel sprays the plants ahead of me before pattering to a new resting spot. I plant my foot and halt the slide while posing what I hope to be quite the dashing figure. For who, I’m not certain. The woods remain empty but for the squirrels, and they have other matters on their minds.

My moment of self-indulgence complete, I return my feet to the pedals and continue down the trail. I sink back into my rhythm, leaning left and right as the trail demands. Too soon I emerge upon the paved path. While I could easily spend the rest of this warm October evening in this park, I can not. At least not tonight. With homework and dinner beckoning, I ride off, returning the woods to its tranquility under the golden sun.

* What modifications (if any) they've done
* How many miles it has

I'm also going to ask if I can get a shot of them with their car.

Thankfully, it's all covered under warranty. We got a brand new loaner (45 miles!), and everything is being covered. The employee was even joking that it was good, because we don't even have to pay for the oil change!

I have never raced before, and I've not even followed racing before.

Unfortunately, I live in Minnesota, so the weather has been less than ideal. I can get in rides for about an hour, but any longer and my fingers go completely numb.

I have read a few basic guides on race strategy, but I have no knowledge beyond that.

So, given all of that info, what should I do to prepare? I'm planning on riding pretty much every day until we leave, but I'm not sure if the weather will cooperate. Are there certain exercises or drills that I should be doing? how about guides to read or videos to watch?

Also, my LBS owner recommended that I move from my current Continental UltraSports to Gatorskins, as he said that punctures are common in beginner classes. Is this a necessary step? I'm trying to keep costs down, but I'd be willing to spring for them if it will make a significant difference.

In the past I've tried these mounts, but each has given me some sort of problem:

* Stem mount. I used a handlebar mount to attach the camera to my road bike's stem. I ended up with tons of vibration and jelly, even on brand new roads. The footage was practically unwatchable, even after editing.
* Helmet mount. I strapped the camera to the top of my bike helmet (there's not a large enough surface to use a sticky mount). It was better than the stem mount, but I still had a lot of vibration and jelly, plus I disliked the motion with my head.
* Chest mount. I've only used this while mountain biking, and it has given the best results. The footage is fairly smooth and jelly free, but not quite as good as I'd like. The big downside is the chest mount itself. To be stable, it had to be tightened down pretty far, to the point where it was a bit more difficult to breathe after periods of harder exertion.

So, does anyone have any suggestions for mounts that will give good looking footage, and won't hamper my range of motion or ability to breathe?
