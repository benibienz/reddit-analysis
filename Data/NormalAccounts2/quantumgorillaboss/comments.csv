91,"This is mostly a list of everything that was broken about year 1.

1 - crotas end, the raid that everyone cheesed and complained about. 
2 - Fatebringer, VOC, Hunger of Crota, Word of Crota, Black Hammer - all first order optimal stratagies that became REQUIRED to play the game - abolishing the element of choice for players
3 - Gjallarhorn the only exotic that anyone ever used for endgame content by HOW - no one did Solas without it if they could help it. 
4 - leveling up through armor and the overlevelled content that was a substitute for challenging dynamics. 
5 - contrary to this point everyone complained that getting to the level cap in Y1 was annoying because it meant that you could only ever wear the hive Armour and could only get there by repeatedly running CE - after HOW everyone said that it was too easy. I genuinely don't remember any time when people said that the leveling was ""just right"".
6 - Nightfalls - the thing that you always HAD to do first in Y1 - wanna do the raid tonight, sorry guys, i'd love to but I haven't done my nightfall yet :(
7 - the point about XP is kind of right, but funnily enough motes are just like bounties, you can save them up and use them whenever you want. 
8. Heroic, nightfalls younger brother and then thing that you HAD to do next to make sure that you had the SG to shop at Xur's magical emporium. 
9. Less available exotics, probably the thing that people complained about most, RNG being a bastard and the fact that if you didn't have a gally, tough- the game was just twice as hard for you than the special ones who did. 
10 - Xur was the only way to get exotics for most people people compained about that too, why couldn't they EARN their exotics through special quest chains, they said.
- you are right though, would be nice to have more definite communication about what to look forward to.

But most of this year one magic is stuff that made me dislike the game more and seemed to keep people coming back to this forum to complain.

114,"Not the only thing that makes a diffeerence, and not the thing that makes the most difference. First time I cleared oryx I was 298 and our team did it in 3 tries. This was after doing Daughters in 20 mins or half and hour. 

Just before joining that group I had been stuck on daughters for hours - with a high light guardian (with loads of clears), who was raid leading, getting really exasperated and sarky with people and complaining when others got things wrong, although I have to say he wasn't quite as verbose on the topic of how to do it right. This was in a raid team that he had joined, which was supposed to be a chill way to learn. 

The difference between the two teams wasn't light level, or experience, both teams had people who had never cleared before and both teams had people who were under 300. What the first group lacked was communication and positive attitude, which made much more of a positive difference.

I feel like this is one of the best improvements to Destiny in year two, that gear and light levels matter less than skill, communication and attitude.

This then makes it damn near impossible to do for anyone who doen't have those items from running every raid three times a week.

142,"&gt; , it's really not as frustrating as Crota or Skolas. Deaths are still usually caused by player mistakes (forgetting knights, etc) rather than light level.

yeah, the level delta isn't nearly as bad this time round, doing the NM raid at 290-95 wasn't nearly as punishing as trying to do the crota raid at 31! Again, this is because they HAD to level scale for all the people who had guns like black hammer and ghorn, weapons that made then encounter easy enough for pros to solo, while others were struggling with completing it to get the only armor available that would allow them to reach the level cap.",2015-11-27 15:32:40+00:00,cxerh28,8,t1_cxelg4v,21198,DestinyTheGame
143,"The problem with that is that, before they properly understood the balance of the difficulty curve of the game, they released a whole lot of ""First order optimal"" guns as raid rewards, and that meant that content was a whole lot easier for those who didn't have them. Running Skolas with a team of three who were each equipped with maxed out fatebringer/black hammer/gally load outs and raid heavy boots was a fundamentally different experience than running it with ANY other combo of any of the other weapons in the game. This meant that they had to rate the difficulty gradient much higher. This is why everyone also bitched and moaned about all the HOW weapons, their existing weapons were so much better. 

This is why you will never be able to level up your old VOG weapons to the new power max, and if they re-release them by updating the poser level of the RAID they will be massively redesigned. 

Although I would love to use those weapons again myself, I agree that they should be left behind, because they made the game a worse experience by creating situations where endgame content was inaccessible and massively overlevelled to compensate for these strategies, for anyone that didn't receive them.

I personally dont really want to go back to always HAVING to use the raid primaries for every single nightfall and bit of endgame content I run, because that is the only way to kill any shielded enemies; there are w wealth of amazing exotic primaries (jade rabbit, BG, darth suros) that I could be using instead, that are way more fun and not completely game breaking.

146,"I have to agree, I have loads of stuff to do and loads of new, versatile weapons that are ALL good choices to level up. 

I think that reaching the highest point of the level cap is less of an issue this year to because they haven't had to over-level endgame PVE content as much in order to balance for FOOS like the Fatebringer/Black hammer/Gally loadout. 

I waited till I was over 290 before attempting the normal mode raid, and it was much more accessible than NM VOG was as a lvl 27 (which was the level cap WITHOUT raid gear in vanilla), and way more accessible than the HM Crota was at level 31.

As a working adult this makes the game alot more relaxing and fun for me, I no longer have to worry about definitely doing HM VOG and NM crota every week in order to be in with a chance of maybe getting the only weapons that will be high enough on the power curve to allow a mid-level player to complete over-leveled end game content that was the skolas encounter. 

If I do the raid and get better LL stuff - great! but if I don't I am no longer left feeling that I have wasted my time, because I didn't get roll the only massively overpowered guns that made endgame content accessible.

209,"&gt; n't stay moving and not die you need to work on that, because that part is easy.
&gt; 
&gt; With 3 people on each mine it takes 1-2 seconds to dismantle.

Yeah, this i what I was doing. the only problem is that there are so many things happening that one little thing can cause a wipe. I was working on it for around 7 hours on Friday, that was an hour and a half to get to skolas and the rest of the time attempting to beat him. We got to the second mines several times and past them once (then a fourth mine spawned, so wipe) and got to or beyond the first set of mines nearly every time, so we weren't terrible. It just takes so long to get to the second mines, then if something goes wrong you have to start all over again, compared to atheon or crota where each attempt takes a maximum of 10 minutes. 

The whole way through all those hours I realised that the thing that our fire team spent all our time doing was running in circles. We would go to upper platform, engage some mobs, rotate to lower platform than engage some more. Warlock would die so we would rotate some more to pick him up when the adds were clear of the area and then if there were few enough adds, engage skolas. Then rotate some more and rinse/repeat.

So that seven hours, the majority of what I did wasn't shooting, knifing or loosing savage powers against the minions of darkness, but simply running away, then turning and picking on the littlest mobs till we had thinned the herd.

Anyway, despite this the thing that I find most annoying is that I haven't completed it was exhausting and and long but wish I could complete it because it is the only thing I need for my triumphs...",2015-08-24 12:04:31+00:00,cudsre6,3,t1_cudf48l,38528,DestinyTheGame

228,"As another poster said above, Destiny isn't really like most other MMO's, other games have players developing characters with unique stat combinations and this becomes the thing that the user invests their time and care into. Look at all of the fuss over the weapon balancing, people are invested in these weapons because they ARE the things that define their characters abilities. 

If I am forced to choose between getting all new legendary gear and/or maybe re-upgrading our exotics (like we had to with TDB) in order to 'keep me interested' in the new content on the one hand and having a clear and achievable upgrade pathway for exotics and legendaries that allows me to keep the small amount of time I have been able to invest per week and still allow me to move forward, I would absolutely pick the latter. 

Funnily enough it sounds as if you would too, you say you want to be able to get rid of all of your legendaires, appart from you fatebringer (obvs) because that IS your favorite gun, and you really want to keep that one over the years, but mine is my VOC, I really want to keep that one over the years, so can we have a nice quest line for that as well?

Other people might want to upgrade their trials messanger that they got from the only 9-0 run they ever managed, should there be a special quest for that. 

That is precisely why bungee created the etheric light system, it is simple and it works, provided we 'nerf' some of the existing classes to make them more defined and stop the outright dominance of a few specific weapons.

On a personal note, as someone who hasn't been lucky enough to have FB BH or Gally yet, I find it almost embarrassing trying to find teams for Skolas, an encounter that I have invested hours into without result, partly because it is balanced to take into account overpowered guns that I don't have despite playing since TDB times.

I am a filthy casual, and don't really have alot of time to dedicate to destiny each week, I can just about manage enough time for NF, heroic and the middle 2 POE's on the one character, and that isn't enough to get those drops guaranteed. This is one reason why I for one wouldn't be as likely to continue with destiny if it went on to obsolete all of my existing gear (not saying I will definitely drop it, I'm first class addict as much as the next person here, but I would be less likely.

232,"Funnily enough it seems like the nerfs you are complaining about all address the problems that you are describing. 

For the first point, what you are describing as the ""proper"" way to make players move on to new weapons and armor is described in game design circles as power creep (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxszx60ZwGw): making new weapons better powered/with better perks so that the boss fights need to take more damage and abilities to complete, making the kit we have invested time into useless as soon as a new release comes out, which will probably be happening 3 times a year for the next decade.

On the other hand the end game encounters SHOULDN'T always require the same three weapons to complete, but Bungie has the choice between letting our hard won weapons slide into uselessness by withholding upgrade pathways from us for the rest of the releases, (which would really make your Gally, FB and BH totally useless by next summer) or balancing out the perks on these weapons so that they can release things that are COMPARABLE. This means that peeps like us can sit on boards like this and talk all day about which sniper is best for which encounter, because in the end they all come down to play style and preference. This second pathway is much harder, but I think that they are doing the right thing by taking it. 

Also we already have shields on bosses that mean we should change weapon types, but guess what, the power of gally means that people still use it even if they are on an arc burn NF, and people still use a BH/FB combo on arc shielded bosses because the damage/accuracy falloff is so negligible on what is supposed to be a close to mid range weapon (FB) that they can use it to knock down the shield and then use black hammer the rest of the way. 

If Bungie did what you want them to do your fatebringer, black hammer and gally would be useless shardsworths at the bum end of your vault next summer, if you were still even playing he game. On the other hand, if they keep balancing their weapons carefully, and allow upgrade pathways similar to the one we saw with HOW, they will still be relevant but not necessarily dominant and the endgame activities will be accessible to people who may have not yet lucked out on the big three PVE guns. 

TL/DR Bungee are balancing, not nerfing guns and this practice enables them to keep our weapons relevant.",2015-07-23 12:40:00+00:00,ctd9v7j,2,t1_ctcj0g3,58878,DestinyTheGame

but by changing the weapons they then CAN change the encounter, because the encounter doesn't have to be overweighted to stop all peopl e who have the few elite guns burning through the encounter in record time. With more balanced weapons we can have more balanced encounters that require skill and tactics rather than only massive damage over a short space of time.

These guns are really great, but one of the most prevalent complaint from HoW was how underwhelming the weapons were and how people didn't feel motivated to acquire them. This is partly because they already have a whole host of OP weapons that they can use to super burn any boss. 

I am going to be pissed that my weapons have been nerfed, but I think it will make for a smoother game overall. ",2015-07-17 13:43:21+00:00,ct6j2zc,5,t1_ct6fuql,7886,DestinyTheGame

Maybe if they made the treasure room drop at the end of the 5th round of 35 POE and then had a lighthouse equivalent drop for after the Skolas round, that could be a bit like the lighthouse. Then you could use that to drop elemental primaries...

My proof is the:

Pretorian Foil

Also my proof is that if you do HM first your advisor shows that you have claimed the rewards for HM too.

Anyway we have already solved this in a separate minithread in another part of this thread.

If you do NM first you will only be able to get NM weapons, then when you do HM you will only get HM weapons because you already got your NM rewards for the week. If you do HM first you will get all the rewards for both modes and will be unable to get any more rewards from NM.
