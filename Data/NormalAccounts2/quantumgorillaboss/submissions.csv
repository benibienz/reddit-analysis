I know that bungie have declared that all Y1 gear will perform the same in Y1 content, but when we changed over, I had a lower light light value than I do now that I bought a ghost shell. 

So was my initial average light level the same as my Y1 34 light level, or will I be the same level when I get to average 170 light?

Anyway, I still haven't been able to get my triumphs, despite the unholy hours I have poured into POE 35, so can anyone who has tried it on the old and new tell me if it is now easier (worth giving it a bash this weekend) or harder(not worth bothering with so kiss those triumphs goodbye)?
