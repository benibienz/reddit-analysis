11,Thank you for all your reactions. As i said I didn't mean to disrespect the act of the buddhist monk but to remember it. I didn't mean to make a realistic image either. I wanted it to be clear that this was taken by a well known picture and this is why I left the still flames behind the moving ones that I added. It seemed dishonest to me to completely remove the original flames in order to make this look more realistic. It might not have been the best choice but I am comfortable with it and I'll keep your comments in mind for my future creations. ,2016-06-12 07:35:33+00:00,d45s2pr,1,t3_4nkkb7,85877,Cinemagraphs
