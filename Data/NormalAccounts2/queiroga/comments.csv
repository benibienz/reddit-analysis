28,"sure thing! i usually start with princess or ice wizard in the back and if they're waiting i put a mini pekka in the same lane to reach the river at the same time as the princess/IW. at that time i have enough elixir to make a piggy push on the other side. most people seing the mini pekka put their primary defense on that side and are left with a less optimal one on the hog rider side.

if they have the initiative i just use cannon as a cheap distraction, put princess and IW on the back slowing the push and MP/gobs taking care of it. when they're done, if i have the elixir i put the hog rider in front of what's left for a counterpush.

my main problem are miners. cannon are useless against miner decks and i cant seem to guess where they put it, lol.

balloon decks are also a bit tricky, it depends a lot on cannon positioning (to separate tank from balloon) and their ability to take care of the cannon fast enough (to give time for the balloon to reach our tower)",2016-09-20 08:38:27+00:00,d7ucpka,2.0,t1_d7txt0b,28469.0,ClashDecks

102,"&gt; b) It's very specifically there to film the people, so that you can go back and see the behavior of individuals who were in view of the camera.

No, it's there to film an area. If it were to film a specific person (like the example i gave) it would lock to a specific someone's face and follow him.
It's the same difference between me taking a pic of a crowd (concert audience) or someone specific, disregarding the rest around him.

&gt; Journalists have no special standing in the US, if you need to be licensed by the government to perform journalistic functions it completely defeats the purpose of having freedom of speech. Anything a ""journalist"" can do any citizen can do.
You don't have to show a ""press card"" to assist unauthorized areas like backstages or press conferences?

&gt;Same with in the US. Like I said, it all comes down to whether or not you have a reasonable expectation of privacy where you are. If you're in public you don't have a reasonable expectation that your activity is private. Whether it's someone taking a picture of you or writing down what you're doing it's treated the same. In a private place, or ""private sphere"" as you put it, you would have a reasonable expectation of privacy.

The problem with that ""expectation"" is that varies from people. Mine is certainly different from yours, as i grew up with a law opposite from yours. My personal expectation when i take a walk is that someone can watch me, talk to me but not taking pictures of me, touch me, etc. Everything that i consider to invade my personal space.
But as i was saying, i think it's very subjective, i don't think a law should rely on such subjective concepts.

PS: despite the fact that we have such opposite views on this matter, i'm enjoying this exchange of points of view. thx for that

103,"the examples you gave drift from the original situation, or those i am referring.
for instance, surveilance cameras dont apply in what i'm talking because a) most of them aren't in public places (like stores in your example) and b) they're filming an area, the subject of the filming isn't a specific person.

of course journalists also don't apply. if you're a public figure representing someone (sport club, company, state, etc) you know you're exposed. that's why you can have exceptions in laws.

it's not hard, it just has to be stated what you can or can't do. there are clear examples of situations where you can (as you stated, surveilance or journalists) and situations where you shouldn't, like the ones i described. in my country even journalists have issues filming the private spheres of celebrities.

217,"Today i had the opposite experience! Probably 1st game this season on ladder using tempo mage (my version of it) and go against priest, on rank 20 (that's why i think it was my 1st game this season). My opening hand sucked ass, with Sneed's, flamestrike, fireball and counterspell. He uses mind vision and i shiver. He uses mind vision again!

He got counterspell both times...I won easily since he was clearly new to the game and i was at that rank solely because the lack of games. But i felt sorry for him",2015-07-15 15:08:12+00:00,ct475jo,1.0,t3_3ddimf,8975.0,hearthstone
218,"sorry, can't agree with you on this. on my char i want something that makes me win more, not lose less! if i only get something when i die, i can't capitalize on that, since i'm dead...",2015-06-19 14:34:53+00:00,csbvhly,5.0,t1_csbpan4,17718.0,heroesofthestorm

We don't want a trait that only applies when we die...the objective is to never die. If we never die, it's the same as having no trait!",2015-06-19 09:26:15+00:00,csbp44z,3.0,t1_csblws8,12185.0,heroesofthestorm
