I usually get all the movies i see, but didn't get this one. What i felt was that there was a lot of build up and no payoff, i was always expecting the puzzle pieces to fit together, for it to make sense, and it never came.

There are hints at the end of a twist, a revelation, something more...what was it? It was i that didn't understand? It was a bad job from the film makers on explaining it? Was there even anything to understand?

A few questions:

* why did Finkel got affected by the outcome?

* why did Longo wink at the courthouse?

* why all the Felicity Jones scenes? What was her purpose/role?

* was it an open ending, as in, for us to understand how we want it?

* what was the connection between them, the similarities, what was that for?

* finally, what's the point of the movie? what's it about?

i don't remember it being discussed here before (as in, a major thread for it, just saw small glimpses here and there) so bear with me if it has.  

Quick play as it is it's just a big mess. It aglomerates all kinds of people, being people that just want to chill, people who want a competitive feel (but dont want to play ranked that moment for various reasons), people that want to train their individual skills with a specific hero (that probably doesn't suit what the team needs), people that want silly games, etc. This makes the quick play experience bad for everyone, since they are all searching different things in a match.  

That's why i think the game could gain something from dividing quick play into a more ""serious"" mode, where people actually try to win the match, switch heroes, make a reasonable comp, etc and a ""chill"" mode for people that don't want to play a hero the team needs but the one they want, or just try silly things like all mercy, etc.  

I've always tought this, but with the recent news that blizzard is thinking about putting the ""one hero limit"" on QP, it fits perfectly. The serious mode could have the limit and the chill mode retain the ability to do whatever you want.

with the launch of Overwatch, we see that it still has the same POTG algorithm as seen previously on Beta.

&amp;nbsp;

What do we already know about the algorithm?
*Registers the number of kills in a small amount of time
*Adds points for damage done in a small amount of time
*Adds points if you interrupt an enemy ULT
*Somehow considers Mercy rez

&amp;nbsp;

How could it improve? (personal opinion)
*Not give so many points to indirect damage (Torbjorn or Symettra turrets), especially if that player dies/is dead on POTG
*Take into consideration the timing of the POTG - give more points if it precedes the capture of a point, for instance
*Award if someone has less help on doing it (controversial point). It's easy for Mcree to do a high noon if they're all frozen by Mei, right?

&amp;nbsp;

Anything to correct? Anything to add? Feel free to give some feedback, thanks!
