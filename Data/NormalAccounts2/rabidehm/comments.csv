I'm cheap2play, so not super-hardcore but still p(l)ay enough to have a few good things.

* Xion w/ Attack Up L @ 100%
* Ill. Black Coat Mickey w/ Ability Up &amp; Attack Up M @ 130%
* Ill. Riku w/ Lux Up &amp; Attack Up L @ 100%
* Saix w/ Ability Up &amp; Attack Up M @ 100%

It's hard to say what my Lux generation has been with 0 AP going on, but it was in the tens of millions last week with the raid bosses around. Now it's lower.",2016-09-13 13:04:11+00:00,d7kwvfi,2.0,t1_d7jvpk9,66598.0,KingdomHearts

6,"The video only covers boss fights and I believe the mechanics are still due for a fine-tuning before the actual release, but to sum it up:

Players have stamina and health on the same gauge. Stamina is depleted from the left, health is depleted from the right. If your gauges ever meet in the middle, you die. Both moving and attacking take stamina. You can move and attack in any order, but movement can't be interrupted by attacking (no ""move, attack, move""). Each character class has different attack strengths, but damage is determined by dice rolls. You can opt to rest at the beginning at your turn (no attacking for the rest of the turn, but you can still move) to clear any stamina you've used (health damage remains). You can Estus a limited number of times to remove any damage you've taken (stamina usage remains).

The tutorial was just on a boss fight, so I'm not certain the exact mechanics for regular enemies, but it seems like the bosses activate after each player's turn. The boss has a deck of attacks that are shuffled together at the start of the encounter to form it's rotation. The cards have things like rotating the boss, moving the boss, attacking in a certain direction, or specifically targeting the last player to do something. Boss damage is a static number depending on the card. Each character class has STR and DEX ratings that you can try to use to dodge or deflect hits with, again being determined by dice rolls. Once the boss is at half health, a new tough card is added to it's encounter dark and gives it a new move.

The video doesn't fully explain magic, equipment, other items, regular enemies, exploring into new rooms, or how mini boss encounters work.

I'm not sure how I feel about player damage being determined by dice roll. That seems to introduce a large chance element, when weapons in the actual Souls game have a fixed amount of damage and it's not really up to chance. I suppose you could miss, but missing and accuracy isn't really a mechanic native to the games themselves unless you're just bad at targeting enemies. I'm okay with the stamina/health gauge combination, it just seems like the general player pattern is going to be ""Turn 1: Attack/Move. Turn 2: Rest. Repeat"", but there is the element of being able to just go ham on the boss but leaving yourself open to attacks, which is definitely a feelings from the Souls games.",2016-04-20 13:09:44+00:00,d2a8tig,2.0,t1_d29il58,51960.0,darksouls3

13,"Sorry if this isn't the right thread, but I'm looking for some shoes I saw in a show that I really like the look of ([here](http://i.imgur.com/YSttsqK.png) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/1okP2Ak.png)). The cut of the vamp combined with the dual-tone coloring is really interesting to me. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find a good match after having searched for the last few days. The closest I've found is [one that was similar](http://i.imgur.com/FS7PgxG.jpg), but are unfortunately in a women's size, and are a bit boot-ier than the shoes features in the show

Can anyone perhaps point me in the right direction?

16,"Possibly a non-issue at this point, but I just went through the same issue before determining that it was something with the Metal app, and not actually Disa. I wouldn't receive any chat notifications without manually refreshing the browser page, but after logging out of and uninstalled Metal (and waiting about an hour or so), chat messages went back to normal. I've since reconfigured Disa and things still seem to be working okay.

I'm not 100% sure if this is an issue with the app, or FB was fixing things on their end at a convenient time.",2016-03-03 21:42:48+00:00,d0mjemk,1.0,t3_46oaxe,1104022.0,Disa
