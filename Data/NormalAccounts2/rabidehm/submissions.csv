Personally, I have a hard time keeping track of these for the various trophies/achievements. It's basically all copied and pasted from the fextralife wiki, but it's a bit nicer than having to flip back and forth between the various pages.

You can find the other checklist over [at this link here](https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/4eyttr/dark_souls_iii_checklist_for_the/) if you want a checklist consolidated to one big spreadsheet.",darksouls3,"Ring, Spell, and Gestures Checklist with Locations",https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/4f7v1y/ring_spell_and_gestures_checklist_with_locations/
