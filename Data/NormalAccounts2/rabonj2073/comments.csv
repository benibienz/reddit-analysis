36,"just because the Econ is not 100% driven by U.S. At this point does not mean it's not sandbox. Honestly unless all the UO babies come back to playing I don't think I want a 100% player ran Econ. Shit The Repopulation had that and there Econ was fuck in one month. Plus there could be a chang in our NPC interaction for the NA. This is a da Xbox just not UO or SWG but still has enough sandbox to be one. Also I would think this game is like AA and that was a SandPark game nott 100% sandbox but enough to be called one. Everyone has there opinion.

Oh and they said something about adding I trading to our version. So just be use its not in the KR or JP version does not mean it won't be changed for us.  Kinda why I do t like testing games that are being localized because they can change and then you have you opinion set already.",2015-08-13 23:20:28+00:00,cu267yu,6,t1_cu19sx3,66349,blackdesertonline

39,"I remember them calling AA a Sandpark game with sandbox elements. Not a all out sandbox, I think that the term now mean if it has an open world and you have housing and can craft things and there is not raid bosses etc... its a sandbox or has elements of. GW2 was a GVG but that was never a sandbox so was Warhammer online that was a GVG never a sandbox. So I wonder why there is a connection to classifying this as one?

42,You see the funny thing about some of the followers for streamers is that they are there no matter what game they play. They are not there to look at the game they are there to watch there entertainer. Think of streamers like wrestler people watch wrestling cause they like there person they root for. Same with streaming audience they watch them cause they like there personality not because of the game. Some will stay around cause they want to know about he game but most are there to listen and talk to the streamer. A lot of them have the game so they can play with there streamer. Now if you take that into account unless that streamer plays that game for any given amount of time depending on how big they are they will play something else. Then that crowd will follow. You have a better chance of keeping the followers of smaller streamers. When I say small I mean 500 and down. I understand you upset I'm one of the small streamers and I paid for my founders but the game got a lot customer the way they did it.,2015-08-12 19:45:50+00:00,cu0qz47,10,t1_cu0qivi,644,blackdesertonline

44,"I guess i think of it that way cause i watched alot of SAO lol. PVP to me is gvg or arena or 1v1 for standings. PKing to me is like that jock in school that holds your head over a trash can and tells you if you dont bring me money then you will eat the apple thats been in there for a week. 

Now that being said you live by your choice so if you want to do that then you should also be willing to take the penalty for doing it. As i know the Karma system make it really bad for PKing. So the guard attack you like and the npc wont talk to you. Now since we are talking about sandbox. That is you changing the world well at least for you it is. If the dev would put in like a cave that underground merchants sell goods and maybe not kill you if you enter a town but make it to where the NPC sell you good for a higher price cause they dont like you. Maybe a lower price cause there scared of you. Make a bounty system so that it gives people who want to hunt you down a purpose. The reward for the PKing would be you are known through out as a person who kills. Like an old Kung Fu movie. That would be cool.

46,"you can cause real life can be quote in quote a sandbox. This is going out there so bare with me. In IRL you can do what ever you want that does not mean there are not consequences when you break the law and get caught..

If i wanted to right now i can set up a lemon aid stand and sell juice to people. That to me is the def. of sandbox that i as a toon can do what i want when i want and deal with the hazards as they come.",2015-08-12 18:28:16+00:00,cu0no3b,4,t1_cu0hp68,8469,blackdesertonline
47,I also know Sandbox titles that have a linear story but you dont have to follow it. Just saying so non-linear play does not auto mean sandbox.,2015-08-12 18:25:12+00:00,cu0njc0,7,t1_cu0ni3r,49,blackdesertonline
48,"that is true but you cant deny that when you say oh hey guys there is a new sandbox game you don't auto think in your head i wonder if the PVP is going to be any good

53,That is true but majority think PVP when you think sandbox. That's what I am trying to see from the community. Cause when I think sandbox I think you live by your actions in game. So that is why I said the PVP system. There are a lot of post not liking the system as is. ,2015-08-12 15:24:55+00:00,cu0fzv0,2,t1_cu0fa94,1092,blackdesertonline
54,Or to add more since you can't go into town if your karma so to high you pay a merc guild to buy you things and make you things. See there are endless possible thing you can do. Makes the game more interesting,2015-08-12 14:11:11+00:00,cu0d9gh,5,t1_cu0d6tb,132,blackdesertonline
55,Well let's think here you want to be reward for fucking a persons day up. Not saying it's a bad thing but we all know what it really comes down to they are farming or you just get a wild hair up your but and go on a killing spree. There really should be no reward for that you choice was to be an outlaw. In the eyes of the game. Now the karma system is kinda harsh but I like it due to this fact. If you are a PKer you make a name for yourself as that. You are known for the man who kills others. You now get people to hunt you down see where I am going with this. It make interaction with the community maybe some one now pays others to hunt you down like a bounty. There is nothing wrong with this that in its self is your reward. Now what the dev could do is make your own little town somewhere in a cave and also remove the hairdos killing you in town. if you come into a town you can PK people but the NPC sellers would also charge you more cause they don't like you. This is a sandbox MMO so we make the content and world. This is not WOW or rift or Aion etc... sandbox means a living breathing world that the players make. So you actions have a lot to do with how you play. ,2015-08-12 14:08:59+00:00,cu0d6tb,4,t1_ctzg6ci,69598,blackdesertonline
56,You could have did what I did dropped 150x2 on the game and got in that way. I am a streamer and I did not get a magic key. I wanted to Stream and support the game I thought was going to be a game to end all games in my search for MMO sandbox/craft-o-holic.

57,"I agree I streamed AA as well I am not nearly as big as you are but I thought AA was going to be my golden ticket if you will for the MMO I most wanted to be In and settle down then well we all know what happen. As long as the streamer can talk about the game now the facts and details and really have enthusiasm in playing I don't see an issue with it. Now the only time I get upset is when they know nothing about the game and they got enticed into playing it cause they have 4k followers.
