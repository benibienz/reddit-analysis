81,"**Budget** - around 200 on the cans, around 200 on an amp/dac (if necessary)

**Source** - A Mac

**Requirements for Isolation** - These are being used at work, I need closed headphones. 

**Preferred Type of Headphone** - I prefer full sized over ear headphones.

**Preferred tonal balance** - I prefer a warmer sound. I'm sensitive to sharp, brighter sounds. I like detailed bass (not necessarily loud bass, but my hd555's are definitely lacking in bass)

**Past headphones** - I have klipsch x10's and HD555's. I enjoy them both, the klipsch's are IEMS and if I get good isolation, the detail is awesome. The hd 555's have a fun soundstage.

**Preferred Music** - NIN, David Bowie, some electronic music, some new wave/ synth pop stuff. Pretty mixed.
 
**What would you like to improve on from your set-up** - I'm currently using the x10's at work. I dislike using IEMs in general so thats the main issue. I'd like more bass than the hd555's.

I'm currently using HD 555's. I enjoy their sound but they are definitely lacking in bass. I would say I dislike brighter headphones, and typically like a warmer sound. I'd also say I enjoy tight and detailed bass.

Such a biased video. He even at one point says that Liquid would have done worse if they had more prep time with adreN. I swear according to thorin, all the euro teams are good and are just in a slump. If you beat them it's cause they're in a slump, not cause you're better then them.  

He makes a lot of assumptions that you just can't make also. ""If they had won map one, map two would go differently"". He also says olof wouldn't of played if it wasn't the major. That's another assumption. Maybe because of the major, olof is taking time off. Perhaps olof didn't think his injury would affect him as much as it did. Either way, its an assumption. 

I don't think Liquid is unlucky. They choked and couldn't close out. But they are still the team that brought both maps against LG to OT. They are that team that tested LG the hardest this tournament. He says ""Its very rare for LG to do that poorly"" implying that it only got close cause LG played poorly at first. In any sport, if a team doesn't perform well, its usually because the other team prevents them from playing well. ""Oh _____ just played bad, normally they would win"" isn't a valid argument in any sport. ",2016-04-13 04:13:54+00:00,d20rvx5,1.0,t3_4eiym1,15206.0,GlobalOffensive

* The finnex stingray looks like not that much light, I'm a little worried about the wood blocking a lot of light for the plants in the back. The leaves on top are getting light though. Should I be worried?

* Would adding co2 do anything for this tank? Or is more light needed to make it helpful?

* What's that little thing in the second picture? It came with the plants I bought. Should I pull it out, or is it some baby of a cool plant?

* I've been unsure of my filter set up. the intake is in the bottle left, and the outtake is a spray bar in the top right pushing water to the front, and a little upwards.  Notice I have a beta in there so I was trying to lower the flow for it. With the plants now though he has quite a bit of area to hide in. Should the spray bar be shooting water length wise? If so, where would the intake valve be?

Edit: another question: The crypt spiralis in the back left is crinkling. Is that ok?
