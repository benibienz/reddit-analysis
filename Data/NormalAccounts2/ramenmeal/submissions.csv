I'm looking at the pixel as a new phone. I hard that google is offering 100% quality google photo storage for photos and videos. Having said that, is it possible to have your photos and videos *only* stored in the cloud. The only reason for me to upgrade to the 128gb is for photos and videos. So if I take a picture, it doesn't get saved locally and goes directly to google photos. And more importantly, can this be done automatically?

It sounds like they are very similar in sound quality. From what I've read they match with low impedance headphones and can drive very high impedance headphones. I'm kind of just venting/organizing my thoughts, but please give input on if you think I'm weighing one factor too much or too little.

So my decision comes down to which set up has better usability. I'm leaning towards the Element purely because of looks. This will be a desktop setup 

As I see it, the o2+odac is lacking in features. Depending on the configuration, its only additional feature is it can be used as a dedicated amp, or a dedicated headphone amp (one or the other). I highly doubt I would ever use the analog in to skip the DAC, so I would probably get the dedicated DAC out's.  

The Schiit stack is pretty configurable. At the Element's cost I could get the magni uber and modi uber. I believe the biggest pro the schiit stack has for it is that the magni uber can be used as a pre-amp, where as the element only has DAC out. This means if I were to buy some bookshelf speakers I would need them to have a volume control. I have no knowledge of bookshelf or computer speakers. Should this feature be a deciding factor? or do all of them have volume controls? If that's the case, it's not a big deal and actually might be detrimental compared to the Element. 

Last is the Element. I would get the cheaper version without the extra set of RCA in's as I have no reason to skip the dac. This my most important pro so far, the form factor. No $20 6"" RCA cables to connect the dac/amp, only 1 front facing input compared to the o2+odac. Only 1 power cable compared the the Schiit stack (uber editions). I would get the uber editions because if you get one uber edition, you have to get them both to match the enclosures. 

Thoughts?

I'll be using a few headphones...

It's young and doesn't have much color yet, just around the edge of the fins. It was very aggressive during feeding, and very lively. It seemed to like some interaction too. It's in a 1.5 gallon bowl that came with it (I won the betta in a raffle), I have a 20 gallon tank for it, but it's still being cycled. On to the story...
I went on a 5 day vacation. Just before leaving I did a normal water change. I had my roommate feed the it 3 pellets twice a day. 

i just got back and honestly it seems like a different fish D: Color is lost on the edge of the fins (although I ever so slightly I see a similar color). It's moving very lethargically, although it totally freaked out when I put my hand near the bowl. It looks a little bloated in the front half of it's body. It's body seems much darker than I remember, before it was see-through/skin color with black stress marks, now the whole body seems darker w/ stress marks still there.

Assuming it's the same fish, any recommendations? I did an emergency water change already.

I was planning on getting a 12 gallon long tank, [here's my past thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Aquariums/comments/3hn6zk/help_with_my_first_aquarium_set_up/), but it's pricey and I noticed how it's only about 9 inches tall. I'd like a little more height (the 22 gallon long is probably perfect, but it's pretty damn expensive), so I think i'm going to go with a 20L such as [this one](http://www.petsmart.com/fish/aquariums/grreat-choice-20-gallon-glass-aquarium-zid36-16837/cat-36-catid-300065) or [this](http://www.petsmart.com/fish/aquariums/aqueon-glass-aquarium-zid36-31896/cat-36-catid-300065?var_id=36-31896&amp;_t=pfm%3Dcategory). I checked petco and didn't even see any. My LFS had some but they looked similar but for twice the price. 

I'd like a rimless tank but it seems like they're all expensive, and I can't even find one in the 20L form factor. 

Anyway, should I avoid those two tanks for any reason? Just go for the cheapest option at this level? Thanks for your opinions!",Aquariums,Help deciding on an aquarium,https://www.reddit.com/r/Aquariums/comments/3ie8dq/help_deciding_on_an_aquarium/

Below I kinda of just listed my plan for my first tank. Do you think there's any cause for concern? Too hard to maintain for a beginner?

**What I know/want:**

* [Mr. Aqua  12L tank](http://www.marinedepot.com/Mr._Aqua_Bookshelf_Long_Frameless_Glass_Aquarium_Tank_Saltwater_Aquariums_Nano_Cube-Mr._Aqua-AZ11665-FIAQNC-vi.html)
* Black substrate 
* Vallisneria in the fore/middle ground 
* Stem plants on the sides/back (Sagittaria).
* I plan to have one betta and then a school of tetra's in the tank. 
* I want to keep it low-tech planted. I am not going for an overgrown look. Maybe with more experience I'll switch to co2 injecting. 
* Main focus will be some drift wood. 

**Questions/concerns**

* Will the betta's temp/current requirements make this tank difficult?
* What substrate is a good balance for maintenance and low-tech planted?
* What filter and heater I would need for it?
* Any recommended furniture to put this thing on?
* Recommended low-tech light?

Any help is much appreciated!!

* CS GO + mumble @ 144hz

&gt;**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

* I could spend a grand, but I don't want to. I just don't want to be wasting my money. Whatever will ALWAYS be &gt;= 200 fps I'd say to be safe for the 144hz monitor.

&gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

* Now. I can wait if there's a big release coming out though.

&gt;**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)** 

* Motherboard, CPU, RAM, and probably a GPU (I have a 8800gt and a gtx 260 that I can use).

&gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

* California, near a microcenter.

&gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

* Re-using keyboard, mouse, antec 900 case, Corsair hx520w PSU, ocz agility 180gb SSD and monitor. 

&gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

* Sure, just nothing extreme. I'd prefer to not have to get an aftermarket cpu cooler though, and I don't think it should be necessary.

&gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

*  I don't really know what features are common on motherboards now since I've been on laptops for awhile. I'd like quick boot from windows 10, and obviously usb 3.0. Not sure if thunderbolt is a thing on PC's. 

&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

* Re-using my case. Don't really care about coloring/ lighting. 

&gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**

* No.

My receiver died on me, but it lasted since the 90s so I'm not mad hah. 

The main thing I want is user friendliness and ease of use, especially concerning streaming music from mobile phones and from my computer. They all seem to support AirPlay, so I think that will cover pretty much all streaming. I noticed some have built in support for services like Spotify. Is there any benefit to that over using AirPlay from a mobile device?

For video I'll mostly use chromecast. I may change this in the future depending on what becomes the best option. I like how the VSX-45 is hdcp 2.2 compliant just for future proofing.

I also need it to have wifi because it's too far from my router to use Ethernet.
