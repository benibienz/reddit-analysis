4,"When will US and it's citizens learn to tone it's pride down and learn to live with rest of the world?

It's important to have a world perspective, of living together and not living out of fear. It's high time USA cuts down on CIA and foolish defence expenditures. It needs to understand and trust in love. It has to live with the fact that it can't live alone, it needs to share a common world. 

Past foolish endeavours of cold war, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Korea... List goes on, it has earned USA a very bad name, worldwide people believe USA is a bully nation which created the Islamic terror. It is responsible for bringing down many elected governments. Caused innumerable wars. 

Today USA is known for foolish greed which will bring it's downfall. 

It's high time USA chooses to stop being a corporate state and start to run like a nation. 

A nation is made of passion and not money, it's about people choosing to live together as a family. A family that is in harmony with its neighbourhood. 

USA can do it, it's citizens should take responsibility and learn from nations of Scandinavia and Bhutan.",2016-05-03 11:13:05+00:00,d2qv86r,1,t3_4hl6ok,31846,worldnews
