1,That I give the best damn blowjob most guys have ever had (including by girls) but I can't stand the taste of cum or anal (yeah... I'm straight now) lol,2016-09-05 06:49:37+00:00,d7a0oud,1,t3_51622x,34178,AskReddit
2,"This happened at my middle school, kinda

A few kids got hurt running laps so we were no longer allowed to run. At all. All we did was walk laps in gym for about two weeks straight. One day two girls decided to skip. They were caught in the janitors closet having sex... Needless to say when they said why they skipped class, we had running back.",2016-05-30 22:04:29+00:00,d3pmnxv,3,t1_d3pmebu,439,Showerthoughts

4,"At least you apologized (a rarity on here).

I just strongly miss having someone to spoil, but it's not like I'm just going to hand the person a $50 toy and say have fun! I'm looking to make a connection with someone in the process (preferably before I send anything). Especially if I ever want to take something that starts online and move it offline, which would be the end goal. :P",2015-10-04 03:46:41+00:00,cvngavk,4,t1_cvnczrt,6868,BDSMpersonals
5,"Don't take this wrong, but you missed the whole point.

**1)** Look at post history. You should always attempt to do this any ways in searching for a Dom (although many of us use alts, some still use the same alt when we don't succeed the first time).

&gt; What makes this post *special* is it implies looking into my post history. (*hint hint* I mentioned my past post)

**2)** **NEVER** assume. This is the number one thing you can do wrong as a sub. It's how you ruin a D/s, DD/lg, D/b, and/or a M/s relationship *INSTANTLY*. I don't know how many times I've seen these types of relationships break because a Dom or Sub assumed something.

&gt; Tip, **ASK FIRST**.

**3)** *(and this one is personal to me, not all of the BDSM community, but it could still apply)* If you had fully READ my post, I mean really did read it, it says (and I quote) ""gifts **and love**"".

&gt; **PLEASE** fully read a post, not just selectively. I am a romantic and fully believe in love in a D/s relationship, and honestly offended by the fact you overlooked that in choice of only seeing the gifts part.",2015-10-03 16:36:34+00:00,cvmunq9,2,t1_cvmjp37,36568,BDSMpersonals

8,"Just a quick tip, your title will get you almost nowhere. It gives next to no details about you. Biggest problem with your post, you don't include your gender ANYWHERE in it!! :O

Try (if your a guy) 29 [M4F/M] Sissy ISO Master

If your a girl, just replace [M4F/M] with [F4F/M]. Again, if you want only a master, and not a mistress, just [M4M] or [F4M]. Mistress instead of a master, [M4F] or [F4M]. Not saying any of this to be mean, just trying to help! :D",2015-08-24 20:26:28+00:00,cuea9d7,1,t3_3i8abl,8145,BDSMpersonals
