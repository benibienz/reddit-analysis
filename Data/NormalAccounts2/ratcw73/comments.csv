However, the origin of their religion and heads of their religion aren't exactly tolerant.

Another thing, Islam is an ideology. It is subject to criticism. It is not a race. Islam can be changed and people can choose not to be Islamic.

**THE UPDATED LAY OF THE LAND**
 
In May of 2015, CTR separated from its parent organization, American Bridge, and became its own SuperPAC. **This structure allows CTR to retain its independence but coordinate directly and strategically with the Hillary campaign.** This work is necessary now more than ever.
 
Even though the 15 Republican candidates are vying against each other for the nomination, their primary target is Hillary Clinton. And it’s not just the Republican candidates attacking Hillary Clinton. The deliberate, malicious, methodical, and well-funded campaign by the right is amplified by a slew of non-candidate national SuperPACs and projects dedicated to preventing a Clinton presidency, the Republican Party apparatus, the Benghazi Select Committee, and the right-wing media establishment.  That is what Correct The Record is fighting against.

**First**, We run defense against any and all attacks in real time as the primary arm of response and pushback against the Republican party and outside groups.
 
**Second**, The team fills the space in the conversation contrasting Clinton with her opponents.
 
**Third**, We serve as a quote desk to counter balance Clinton critics through media monitoring and rapid response.
 
**Fourth**, The team arms more than 300 surrogates with facts and talking points to spread the message and the facts on cable and other news.
 
To perform these functions, we deploy products targeted to specific audiences.
 
**First**, we produce pushback documents.  These are research-based documents refuting false information, which come in various forms. Some of the pushback documents are research analyses, others are talking points and some are blog-style posts made specifically for the web.  We distribute these pushback documents, as needed, to members of the media, key surrogates, pundits, opinion leaders, and to grassroots Hillary supporters online.
 
**Second**, we produce digital and social media content.  Integrating our research and earned media operations, our digital team disseminates our information via social networks, uses social media to engage grassroots supporters, and produces stand-alone digital products.  Depending on the content, strategy and goal, these products may be targeted to members of the media, political influencers or the grassroots audiences.
 
**Third**, we provide media statements and foster positive media relations with Clinton beat reporters, producers and editors.  Our communications team is constantly in touch with the media and provide, whether in our own voices or in the voices of surrogates, a constant stream of statements to the press on all things Clinton related.  And because media relations isn’t just going on the record, some of our team’s most important work is killing bad stories before they ever get written.
 
**Fourth**, our team undertakes deep dive research.  This work powers all of our activities by closely examining and mining Secretary Clinton’s real record spanning decades and packaging that material for public consumption.  
 
**METRICS**
 
**PRODUCTS**:
• Correct The Record has produced, literally, thousands of pages of research documents including deep research dives into Clinton’s record as Secretary of State, U.S. Senator, U.S First Lady, Arkansas First Lady, and outside of public life since the May 15 split. Overall, CTR has produced more than 750 original research documents totaling well over 15,000 pages.
 
• **REPUBLICAN CONTRAST DOCUMENTS**: Correct The Record published over 30 thematic reports showing the similarity of the GOP’s extreme views, across the field, on a number of issues including immigration, equal pay, caring for our veterans, choice, and voting rights.  These reports contrasted Clinton’s positions with those of her competitors, by topic. Correct The Record contrasted Clinton’s record with 14 Republican candidates.
 
• **STRATEGIC MEMOS**: Since separating from American Bridge, CTR has published 11 strategic memos, bringing the total to 21 in CTR’s overall existence. The memos were placed with the media and each one outlined an emerging theme, framework, or strategy related to the 2016 election and either Clinton or her GOP-rivals.  The strategy memos themselves led to stories in a number of news outlets including National Journal, Politico, USA Today, MSNBC and The Hill.  But more importantly, these deep-dive strategy memos impacted the framework for dialogue about 2016, Clinton, and her competitors.
 
• **ONLINE**: CTR has produced over 300 online graphics and web-videos, which have led to over 4.6 million times that CTR’s content and message were reviewed online since May 15. Overall, CTR has produced more than 400 graphics and web videos, generating more than 8.6 million impressions.
 
• **ENGAGING OPINION LEADERS**: CTR has engaged trusted names as validators of Clinton’s record to defend and support her in the pages of newspaper opinion sections across the country. Correct The Record has placed 132 op-eds nationally and in strategic local markets. Since May 15, CTR has helped write and place 36 op-eds across the country in a number of publications including Politico, Times Union, Huffington Post, CNN, Washington Blade, and New Jersey’s Bergen Record.
 
**ACTIVITIES**:
• **MEDIA RELATIONS**: Correct The Record staff members have conducted over 900 on-the-record and off-the-record media interviews, including over 150 since CTR became independent of AB, to correct facts in stories going to print or on air, to counter-punch and balance Republican attacks on Clinton, and to kill negative stories before they are even published.
 
• **IMPACTING THE DIALOGUE**: CTR has identified 372 surrogates including influential and frequent pundits on broadcast and cable news for Presidential 2016 politics and provided them around 80 sets of talking points, background materials and briefings on topical issues to defend and accurately portray Clinton and her record since the split, more than 400 in total.
o Correct The Record hosted 8 media training sessions in New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio, Colorado, Minnesota, Michigan, DC, and at the DNC meeting, attended by nearly 150 surrogates since the split. In total, CTR has held 16 training sessions in California, New Hampshire, Iowa, Nevada, and South Carolina. To better prepare themselves to defend and promote Hillary Clinton, over 200 surrogates have attended these trainings.
 
o Correct The Record also distributes media advisories to 960 members of the national media and 10,756 regional reporters in 28 states including Wisconsin, Florida, South Carolina, Kentucky, Iowa, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Colorado, California, Virginia, North Carolina, and Ohio. Talking points and memos are also distributed regularly to 369 televisions producers and bookers.
 
• **SPREADING THE MESSAGE**: Over 15,000 individuals receive Correctors emails, urging them to engage on social media to amplify Correct The Record’s message in real time as an online rapid-response team. Correct The Record has also sent emails to the larger Ready for Hillary list, which have been consumed more than 400,000 times.

He does not encourage violence at his rallies. I've been to 3. he's never once said it. He one time said he would like to punch a guy in the face because he was screaming obscenities. One time a black guy got sucker punched by a white guy who was then arrested. 

Then a black guy sucker punched the hell out of two ant-Trump protestors who were dressed in Klan outfits. 

There's been a few discrimination cases against Trump, but it was Trump's fathers business for one, it was also literally 40-45 years ago. They also won some (all?) of them. I know in one case it wasn't that the tenants were black, it was because they were on welfare, and they had a policy against welfare tenants.
The 1991 quote was never confirmed. The writer just wrote it.

Trump falsely claims 4 out of 5 white people who were victims of homicide were murdered by blacks.

It was a retweet, he didn't give a speech on it, and statistically speaking 90% of black victims are killed by other blacks. Crime statistics by ""white"" race is also wonky because they include Hispanics and often times others like Native American. 

Sanders and Hillary have also retweeted wage gap and BLM stuff.

A lot of this just seems like tabloid shit like still obsessing over David Duke, black models, and his retweets.

&gt;He's a populist asshole, a con artist. 

If that is what he is to you, then what is Hillary? She is the damn definition of a corrupt politician. She hasn't done a damn thing in her 30 years in politics other than sit by and watch her husband fuck other women and get impeached for it. She takes millions of dollars from the most intolerant human being on this planet (Saudi Arabia). They throw gay people of buildings and women are second class citizens. Her role model was David Byrd, former KKK chapter leader.

Want me to talk about the subject in a civil manner? I think he has every right to sit for the anthem and flag.

A.) We have a minority as president.

B.) Affirmative Action exists. A minority with a 25 on their ACT will get into a college before someone who is white. A minority is far more likely to get a job than a white personal, if they apply. However many employers have switch to an equal opportunity system.

C.) Minorities are oppressed by one another a lot more than the ""system"" oppresses them.

The organizer of this event is a writer at vice lmfao. He tweeted this:

&gt; If you are angry and upset at #Shutdown of Heathrow, we have noted your silence on the killing of Black people. This is why it happens.

TOO BAD IT DOESNT HAPPEN IN THE UK. In the last 5 years, 7 people were killed by police in the UK. 4 of them were white. 3 were black. 

I'll tell you why it happens here. Police presence is **much** higher in black communities. I live in a fairly white community/neighborhood. I haven't seen a cop car or police officer here in years (Of course a sheriff lives down the street from me). However, I know people who live in predominantly black neighborhoods and have wandered around downtown Columbus and Cleveland. There are so many cops. There is one on every street it seems. You want to know why? Because crime rates are higher there.

So the point is, if there are more police in one area than another, there will be more shootings. That is a fact. ",2016-08-05 18:42:09+00:00,d65po10,1.0,t3_4wbwnh,252.0,The_Donald

If you are a Nvidia user like myself: 

1. Go to Nvidia control panel.

2. Go to 3D settings and click Manage 3D Settings.

3. Click Add and navigate to Batman.

4. The option below that is to choose preferred graphics processor, choose you Nvidia High Performance Card. 

5. Click Apply.

6. Go to the steam folder with the Batman .exe

7. Right Click and click properties. 

8. Navigate to Compatibility

9. Click Run as Admin.

10. Click Apply.

This worked for me. I'm currently running at 60 fps at all times, I can run at higher FPS, but I only have a 60 hz monitor.

They either a) enhance features of Jewish people. When they do this they usually increase ear size, hook the nose, slightly close the eyes, slightly open the mouth, and usually make them frowning. Sometimes they sneer. or b) make them look like rats.

655,"***Good Evening President Trump,*** 

I just want to thank you for giving the American people a voice. Ever since you have announced your candidacy, my confidence has been at an all time high.

As a college student, it can be hard to be conservative on campus. It seem's if you aren't liberal, people will exclude you or shun. I go to Ohio University, which is one of the most liberal college campuses in the Midwest, and probably the most liberal in Ohio. It is also one of the biggest party schools in the nation, and I'm proud to say I haven't had a drink. I have committed myself to be a teetotaler. 

I've became a lot more social. I've started to care less about what people think and I've started standing up for and speaking for myself. I've lost 85 pounds in this last year. I used to be scared to go to the gym, but now all I care about is making myself great again and not caring about what others think. I just want thank you for inspiring me to change myself for the better this past year. 

**I have 3 questions for you, if you don't mind.**

**1.)** I have been a member of this community since about 5,000 Members. We have seen massive growth over the past 6 months. We are quickly approaching 200,000 Members. How long has the Trump campaign, or even yourself, known about our community?

**2.)** My second question is related to the 1st one. Reddit is an extremely liberal site. Having this conservative supporting subreddit is very hard to maintain. We constantly have trolls and Shills coming in and massively downvoting posts. Not only that, but a couple of months ago, Reddit admins (u/spez) have made it part of their agenda to censor us from the front page of this website. Twitter and Facebook have also made it a point to censor conservative trending topics and hashtags. And just today, it came out that Google is censoring your name from searches. So my question is, what is the best way to fight Internet censorship? It's a very complicated topic because these are private companies, but they are also the modern day town square. 

**3.)** Our country is on a very slippery slope and we definitely have better things to worry about, but what will you do as president to advance space exploration? It seems that the Obama administration has almost completely erased NASA from relevancy and has almost entirely privatized the industry. Not only that, but we have to send our astronauts to Russia or elsewhere in order for them to get to the ISS. It seems like the best years in US history have come with NASA leading the way.

Thank you for doing this AMA, it really means the world to us at r/the_donald.

&gt; An email dated May 11th shows the extent to which the DNC was interested in staging protests. It regards the important meeting between Donald Trump and Speaker Paul Ryan and the header reads: ‘Action in front of RNC on Thursday morning for Trump/Ryan meeting.’

&gt; Regarding a protest in San Francisco, DNC officials helped coordinate a Trump protest that resulted in blocked traffic. 

&gt; On April 29, a DNC press staffer, Rachel Palermo, alerted Eric Walker, deputy communications director, about a Facebook page for an anti-Trump protest on May 2 in South Bend. “Whoo!

We are going on a 10 day vacation a little bit after the 4th of July and we usually keep our dogs in a local kennel when we leave. We thought it through and decided it would be best to put him down before we left, so he didn't suffer in the kennel. So he has about 2 and a half more weeks left with us. 

The vet told us there were a few treatment options but he recommended none of them. We told him we didn't want to do them in the first place. It was radiation therapy. We decided that instead of making him suffer his last days on that it would be best to have as much fun with him as possible, and the vet agreed.

The worst thing about this is the vet said our Scottie was one of the healthiest he had ever seen at that age. He noticed he was very active and controlled his weight. He is a dog that is full of energy and always wants to play. If it weren't for the cancer, the doctor said he could've lived at least to 15-16.

1127,"the tumor/growth is a decent size and is back behind one of his Canine teeth, kind of under the tounge. It is preventing him from fully closing his mouth and seems to have moved some teeth or something. He has seemed to have lost weight too. He has had blood end up in his water and in his blankets. His breath smells so bad that you can smell him when you are 3-4 feet away. I'm not sure if it is melanoma at this time. The vet did not discuss the quality of life yet. The vet we normally take him to said they could not diagnose him because they did not have the proper tools, so we are taking him elsewhere.

This tumor/growth seemed to have came out of nowhere. We took him to the vet recently to get his leg looked at after he hurt it while playing ball and he was also groomed recently, and they did not see it then. It seems to have come up in the last few days, and I did not notice signs of it as close as a week ago. 

He has had many things pop up in the last year. He started having seizures about a year ago and has been put on medicine for that; and just recently hurt his leg and started taking some pain medicine. We also had to give him pills for a bacterial infection in his bladder and they are going to test him for Cushings disease soon. Not only that, but he had some sort of infection in his eye that was causing massive residue build up and was making a ""third eyelid"" come across his eye. 

His current quality of life is very good, aside from the limping. All of the problems I mentioned above seem to be working themselves out after the medication. It just seems like one thing after another with him. He just can't catch a break.

The Paris attack was carried out by Muslim Terrorists. They killed 130 people and injured hundreds more. Guns were used. Keep in mind that Paris has strict gun control laws and the theatre it occurred in was a gun free zone. Was this a gun control issue?

The Charlie Hebdo attacks were carried out by Muslim Terrorists. 12 people were killed and 11 were injured. The attacks were carried out with Guns and Rocket Launchers. They also occurred in a strict gun control area and gun free zone. Was this a gun control issue?

1397,"&gt; Powerful and Continuing Nationalism - Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.

So apparently every Presidential Nominee in the history of the United States is fascist? #ImWithHer, #FeelTheBern, #BuildTheWall, #ChangeWeNeed(Obama) etc.

http://www.presidentsusa.net/campaignslogans.html

Every President since 1840 has had a recorded Campaign Slogan, most of which are patriotic in nature. 

Don't even get me started on the use of flags. Every campaign has a red, white, and blue color scheme and the candidates almost always have flags in the background. 

Obama's Logo was literally an O with a flag in it.

http://blog.logogarden.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Obama2012logo.png

&gt; Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause - The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.

&gt; Muslims, **mexicans, blacks, minorites......anyone non white**

When has Donald Trump ever suggested the need to eliminate or used them as scapegoats?an

You should have two groups there:

Illegal Immigrants and Muslim extremists.

That about it. He has never called for eliminations of race, that is just stupidity on your part.

&gt; Supremacy of the Military - Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.
&gt; Largest most powerful military in the world just keeps needing more and more money.

Again, So apparently every Republican presidential candidate in history is fascist?


&gt; Rampant Sexism - The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Divorce, abortion and homosexuality are suppressed and the state is represented as the ultimate guardian of the family institution.

&gt; ""Blood coming out of her whatever"" Donald Trump

Sexism: prejudice, stereotyping, or discrimination, typically against women, on the basis of sex.

When has Donald Trump done any of that? He has treated women the same as men on the campaign trail giving women special treatment is sexist.

&gt;Obsession with National Security - Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.
&gt;""Ban all Muslims from america"" Donald trump. Constant bickering from his gang that isis is taking over american when it is factually true than isis is in syria....half way around the globe....and is at the moment loosing ground.

He has never suggested that ISIS is taking over America, but it is a fact that ISIS is among the refugees and as you know, no refugees under a Trump presidency. 

&gt; Controlled Mass Media - Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.

&gt; Unfortunately for Trump and his gang he doesn't have this ticked yet. I'm sure he will though cause he's promised to go after media for nonsense...First amendment not important at all.

So should the media be able to blatantly lie? Should they be able to enable violence? They are the people currently creating the violence outside of Trump rallies. The media is dishonest. They constantly lie and defame people. Unfortunatley it is nearly impossible to sue media for slander and libel, which is what Donald wants to fix. 

&gt; Religion and Government are Intertwined - Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions.

&gt; Fortunately for Trump i doubt he's ever even read a word of the bible. Right has shown that given the chance they'ed cross out the first amendment again and enforce Christianity on america

This is just becoming painful to read at this point. Was this written by an edgy 15 y/o atheist or something? No one is forcing Christianity on anyone. I consider myself agnostic. No one wants to get rid of the first amendment and fore Christian values on anyone, except maybe Ted Cruz.

&gt; Obsession with National Security - Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.
&gt; ""Ban all Muslims from america"" Donald trump. Constant bickering from his gang that isis is taking over american when it is factually true than isis is in syria....half way around the globe....and is at the moment loosing ground.

He hasnt ever said that ISIS is taking over America. Where are you getting that? 

&gt; Obsession with Crime and Punishment - Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.

&gt; Absolute love of police. Dismissal of police abuse against African American.

Yes, he praises police. But he has never dismissed police abuse against African Americans.

Birth control is not contraception indiscriminately and thoughtlessly practiced. It means the release and cultivation of the better racial elements in our society, and the gradual suppression, elimination and eventual extirpation of defective stocks— those human weeds which threaten the blooming of the finest flowers of American civilization.

The ministers work is also important and he should be trained, perhaps by the Federation as to our ideals and the goal that we hope to reach. We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members.

From Woman, Morality, and Birth Control. New York: New York Publishing Company, 1922. Page 12 (available here: http://lifedynamics.com/library)
We should hire three or four colored ministers, preferably with social-service backgrounds, and with engaging personalities. The most successful educational approach to the Negro is through a religious appeal. We don’t want the word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population, and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members.

Note that the immigration law of 1924 bans certain races of people outright, like Asians. The bold bit is a thinly veiled call to ban certain races.

It is said that the aboriginal Australian, the lowest known species of the human family, just a step higher than the chimpanzee in brain development, has so little sexual control that police authority alone prevents him from obtaining sexual satisfaction on the streets. According to one writer, the rapist has just enough brain development to raise him above the animal, but like the animal, when in heat knows no law except nature which impels him to procreate whatever the result. Every normal man and Woman has the power to control and direct his sexual impulse. Men and women who have it in control and constantly use their brain cells in thinking deeply, are never sensual.

&gt; Margaret Sanger was an avowed supporter of Eugenics. Eugenics is inseparable from genocidal racism. There is a reason Hitler and the Nazis loved and were so heavily influenced by the Eugenics Movement. It is simply racism dressed up in the vocabulary of science.

Cincinnatus was a Roman Patrician (rich guy) during the Roman Republic. He was a farmer who was very wealthy. He was seen as ""one of the heroes of early Rome and as a model of Roman virtue and simplicity.""

Cincinnatus was known as a patriot in the Roman Republic. During times of crisis, the Roman Senate would elect a ""Dictator"" to take control of the government. Cincinnatus took over in a time of invasion. He defeated the invaders in 2 weeks and handed the dictatorship back and went to working on his farm. He was called back to be Dictator many times and gave it back every single time.

Cincinnatus was a true patriot and only came to power to save his country. He did not want the power, like Trump. He had to do it in order to make Rome a better place.",2016-03-23 01:34:35+00:00,d19xp7z,1.0,t3_4bk6op,5081.0,The_Donald
1803,"He didn't refuse to give up power, the Senate kept asking for him to come back. They had laws regarding how long someone could stay consul, and it was usually 1-2 year terms.

During a time of crisis, the senate was able to elect a ""Dictator"". The connotation of Dictator was different back then. The Dictator was supposed to take over in a time of crisis and then give up the power. Cincinnatus was the one who set this precedent. He would take over for a couple of months and then would go back to working on his farm.

Caesar just kept being asked to come back by the senators (reps of the plebs and patricians) until the time came where they just made him full time. He didn't necessarily try to destroy democracy or refuse to give up power.

A better comparison to Caesar in terms of US presidents would be FDR. He did such a good job, they asked him to run 2 more times. It wasn't a law at the time, but they did make it a law afterwards because they realized what it was becoming.

1814,"&gt; The same can not be said for Donald Trump or Ted Cruz, both of whom are using this attack as an excuse to strike meaningless poses and engage in magical thinking. The idea of either of these clowns being in charge during a crisis should strike a cold jolt of terror right to the heart.

&gt; Trump is already acting like an absolute child about all this, literally equating the bombings with the leveling of the entire city of Brussels.

&gt; Brussels was a beautiful place,” he said on Fox News. “And now you look at it, and it’s a disaster. We have a worldwide situation that is out of control.”

&gt; The bombing was terrible and the damage, both in terms of lives lost and to the city’s infrastructure, is extensive. But contrary to what Trump says, Brussels is still there and still beautiful. Brussels and Paris survived the frigging Nazis, but Trump would have you believe that these cities will be torn to the ground because of attacks orchestrated by scattered, stateless terrorist organizations.
To make matters worse, Trump is using these attacks to chew over his obsessive hatred of immigrants, calling once again for a ban on Muslim immigration. I hesitate to call this response “childish,” because most children are more capable than Trump of understanding how stupid it is to assume collective guilt of a group, in this case Muslims, simply because a few people in it do something wrong.

&gt; More importantly, as the actual adults have repeatedly been clear about, since ISIS uses claims that Westerners hate Islam as part of their recruitment propaganda, the smart move would not be to feed the paranoia. But, Trump is a selfish monster and is willing to feed ISIS’s narrative if it helps him get into office, even though doing so costs lives.""

Yes, he says he will pay the legal fees. He has not done that for any of the people who assaulted protesters without being physically provoked.

What is this logic?

We post these videos because the media keeps saying violence is incited when it isn't. It is discouraged.

The times where Donald has said things violent was when protesters started swinging on supporters/security.

He very clearly says ""If you see someone getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them."" You do realize that throwing things at people is assault right?""

&gt; According to the Rasmussen Reports:

&gt; Support for all three of the remaining Republican candidates has grown with the narrowing of the field, but Donald Trump still holds a double-digit lead over both his rivals for the GOP presidential nomination.

&gt; The latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey of Likely Republican Primary Voters finds Trump with 43% support to Senator Ted Cruz’s 28% and Ohio Governor John Kasich’s 21%. Just five percent (5%) of GOP voters like some other candidate, and three percent (3%) remain undecided.

&gt; When compared with Rasmussen's previous poll in mid-February, Senator Cruz has gained 11-points, Governor Kasich has gained 9-points, and Donald Trump has gained 7-points.

1973,"My Personal Favorite:

**""Fight back.""**

Trump says that he prefers to be cooperative and positive, but that sometimes it's necessary to be confrontational when the other side is treating him unfairly or trying to take advantage of him.
""The risk is that you'll make a bad situation worse, and I certainly don't recommend this approach to everyone,"" he writes. ""But **my experience is that if you're fighting for something you believe in — even if it means alienating some people along the way — things usually work out for the best in the end**.""",2016-03-18 19:31:13+00:00,d14voup,1.0,t3_4azt4i,462.0,The_Donald

1975,"Well, at this point, his campaign has been a giant advertisement for his book *The Art of The Deal*.

#**These are all of the main points in his book. Nearly every single one has been used in this campaign.**

**""Think big.""**

If you're satisfied knowing that you can comfortably make a deal that doesn't require much effort, then you're not thinking big enough.

""Most people think small, because most people are afraid of success, afraid of making decisions, afraid of winning,"" he writes. ""And that gives people like me a great advantage.""

**""Protect the downside and the upside will take care of itself.""**

Trump learned that he would rather own casinos than be a gambler himself.

""I always go into the deal anticipating the worst,"" he writes. ""If you plan for the worst — if you can live with the worst — the good will always take care of itself.""

""The only time in my life I didn't follow that rule was with the USFL [the defunct United States Football League]. I bought a losing team in a losing league on a long shot. It almost worked, through our antitrust suit, but when it didn't, I had no fallback. The point is that you can't be too greedy.""

Get into deals that you can afford to recover from if things go poorly, and know when the opportunity cost for making a small deal is lower than had you not made a deal at all.

**""Maximize your options.""**

**It's necessary to be flexible**, he says.

""I never get too attached to one deal or one approach,"" Trump writes. ""For starters, I keep a lot of balls in the air, because most deals fall out, no matter how promising they seem at first. In addition, once I've made a deal, I always come up with at least a half dozen approaches to making it work, because anything can happen, even to the best-laid plans.""

**""Know your market.""**

Trump says that he likes to rely on his own research rather than the work of consultants, statisticians, or critics. He says that he's made it a habit to collect himself as many opinions as possible about a potential real estate deal to see how it will affect the area and who it will be catering to.

""Trump Tower is a building the critics were skeptical about before it was built, but which the public obviously liked,"" he writes. ""I'm not talking about the sort of person who inherited money 175 years ago and lives on 84th Street and Park Avenue. I'm talking about the wealthy Italian with the beautiful wife and the red Ferrari. Those people — the audience I was after — came to Trump Tower in droves.""

**""Use your leverage.""**

The only way you're going to make the deal you want, he says, is if you're coming from a position of strength and can convince the other side that you have something they need.

Trump says he's not afraid to blur reality to utilize leverage. ""When the board of Holiday Inn was considering whether to enter into a partnership with me in Atlantic City, they were attracted to my site because they believed my construction was farther along than that of any other potential partner.""

""In reality,"" he writes, ""I wasn't that far along, but I did everything I could, short of going to work at the site myself, to assure them that my casino was practically finished. My leverage came from confirming an impression they were already predisposed to believe.""

**""Enhance your location.""**

Trump says that the adage that location is everything in real estate isn't true.

""You can take a mediocre location and turn it into something considerably better just by attracting the right people,"" he writes, explaining that this is what he did with the Trump Plaza location in New York City's Upper East Side. He took the glamour of his Fifth Avenue location, where it wasn't hard to sell luxury, and used its name brand to sell apartments to the same audience in a much less glamorous location.

Taken beyond the real estate industry, his main point is that rather than overpay for something that is already established, you should consider cheaper alternatives that have the potential to be molded to your taste.

**""Get the word out.""**

Once you've made a deal, the only way it's going to be worth anything is to then attract customers, he says. Similarly, creating a public persona helps you get the most out of your next deals.

Trump says that he's always embraced a healthy dose of sensationalism and controversy to pique the media's interest.

**""I play to people's fantasies,"" he writes. ""People may not always think big themselves, but they can still get very excited by those who do. That's why a little hyperbole never hurts. People want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular.""**

**""Fight back.""**

Trump says that he prefers to be cooperative and positive, but that sometimes it's necessary to be confrontational when the other side is treating him unfairly or trying to take advantage of him.

""The risk is that you'll make a bad situation worse, and I certainly don't recommend this approach to everyone,"" he writes. ""But my experience is that if you're fighting for something you believe in — even if it means alienating some people along the way — things usually work out for the best in the end.""

**""Deliver the goods.""**

""You can't con people, at least not for long,"" Trump writes. ""You can create excitement, you can do wonderful promotion and get all kinds of press, and you can throw in a little hyperbole. But if you can't deliver the goods, people will eventually catch on.""

**""Contain the costs.""**

Trump explains that his father taught him to never pay a penny more than you should for something, since pennies can easily turn into dollars.

From observing his competitors, he writes, he's found that throwing money at a project is never the path to success if it was shoddily planned.

**""Have fun.""**

Successful deal-making should be about the thrill of winning and accomplishing something, not solely for making money, Trump says.

""Money was never a big motivation for me, except as a way to keep score,"" he writes. ""The real excitement is playing the game.""

1977,"Ten years ago, Donald Trump had a pretty open mind about gay marriage.

“If two people dig each other, they dig each other,” he wrote about the marriage of Elton John and longtime partner David Furnish. “I’m very happy for them.”

The December 2005 comment was posted on the “Trump Blog” that he maintained on the Trump University website, a kind of journal of Trump’s thoughts on everything from why he chose various contestants for Celebrity Apprentice to why women struggle in the workplace:

“I think women have a tough situation in the workplace because of the sexual undertones,"" Trump wrote in October 2005. ""The business environment is so cutthroat that men and women learn to use whatever they can to get ahead, including their sexuality. Yet, when women do this, the perception of them changes. That's why women have to work harder to overcome obstacles.”

The blog is no longer live on the Internet, some of of blog posts are still viewable through the Internet Archive, a non-profit site that collects website pages.

""Mr. Trump is not a politician. He has been very clear that his views, like Ronald Reagan’s, have evolved over the years,"" said spokeswoman Hope Hicks.

Some of the opinions Trump expressed on the blog run counter to Republican orthodoxy and to views he now espouses on the campaign trail.

For instance, on gay marriage, in June 2015 he told CNN, “I’m for traditional marriage.”

In February 2009, he praised President Obama’s efforts to cap the bonuses of Wall Street executives from companies that were being bailed out by the government, in a post titled “Obama is Absolutely Right.”

“The concept of bailouts is a two-edged sword. If they didn’t do the bailout, we would be in depression No. 2, and maybe it would be just as big as depression No. 1, so they really had to do something. We don’t really know if it’s going to work for quite some time. If it’s really wrong — and it could be wrong — we’re going to really have a mess in two years.""

""We are in a situation that is trial and error. We’ve never dealt with this before. But I think Obama is doing the right thing and all of us must remain alert to what is happening.""

In another post the same month, discussing his appearance on Neal Cavuto’s television show, Trump seemed to break from the broad Republican opposition to President Obama’s $800 billion stimulus package than most Republicans at the time.

“Neal asked me about Obama’s stimulus plan, and I said that something had to be done, but that there are no guarantees. We are in unmapped territory these days. We haven’t encountered this kind of situation before, and it is complex. We can only hope for the best.”

In a 2005 post, Trump defended ""outsourcing,"" the practice of companies moving production overseas that he has railed against as a presidential candidate.

In an August 2005 post titled ""Outsourcing Creates Jobs in the Long Run,"" Trump wrote:

""We hear terrible things about outsourcing jobs — how sending work outside of our companies is contributing to the demise of American businesses. But in this instance I have to take the unpopular stance that it is not always a terrible thing.""

Trump noted a study ""that showed how global outsourcing actually creates more jobs and increases wages, at least for IT workers"":

""The study found that outsourcing helped companies be more competitive and more productive. That means they make more money, which means they funnel more into the economy, thereby, creating more jobs.""

""I know that doesn't make it any easier for people whose jobs have been outsourced overseas, but if a company's only means of survival is by farming jobs outside its walls, then sometimes it's a necessary step. The other option might be to close its doors for good.""

In two blog posts at the end of 2008, he praised both President-elect Obama and Hillary Clinton. Recounting his appearance on a New York radio program, Trump wrote that he had said:

""Hillary is smart, tough and a very nice person, and so is her husband. Bill Clinton was a great President. They are fine people. Hillary was roughed up by the media, and it was a tough campaign for her, but she’s a great trouper. Her history is far from being over.""

Trump also said he had high hopes for Obama's presidency:

 ""Barack will need to be a great president, because we’re in serious trouble as a country. It hasn’t been this way since 1929. So he doesn’t have much choice — he will simply have to be great, which he has a very good chance of being. I saw him speak in Berlin, and what he has done is amazing. The fact that he accomplished what he has in one year is truly phenomenal.""

""After 9/11, this country had a lot of compassion from countries around the world. Within a short amount of time, we were hated. How did that happen? We had no dialog with other countries because they just plain hated us. I think we know who is responsible for that. What’s different today is that we have a new chance, a new beginning. The world is excited about Barack Obama and the new United States. Let’s keep it that way!""

The Trump Blog also included posts from other authors, some of which also seem far from Trump's current views. In one 2010 post, real estate agent Tina Merritt explained how undocumented immigrants could buy homes in the U.S. ""It is not illegal to own real estate in the U.S. even if one is in the country illegally,"" she wrote. ""If getting a mortgage is not an option, one can always pay cash.""

The blog also served as way to promote Trump's various brands and business ventures, many of which — like the university itself — are gone. In 2006, Trump wrote about his launch of a new travel website called ""GoTrump.com""

""I recently put my name on a new travel site, GoTrump.com. It has everything from the ultimate in luxury travel to the absolute best deals on everything from hotels to airfare.""

""It's a great site, check it out. It has to be, or I wouldn't have put my name on it.""

""I've worked hard to make sure the Trump name is found only on buildings of the highest caliber and products of the finest quality. I won't even consider giving my approval to anything unless I know it's the top of the line because when people see or hear 'Trump,' they expect the best. That's just basic marketing and good business.""

The travel site appears to have shut down a year later.

Barack Obama was called a Nazi. GWB and GB were both Called Hitler, all the time. Bill Clinton Was constantly called Hitler. I could go on and on. Every candidate is compared to some evil person in recent history. It is everyone's favorite comparison because he has been one of the worst people of all time.

If you really don't like someone or their ideas, chances are you are going to call them the most negative and extreme name currently related to them. Bernie is called a communist, Trump is called Hitler. Both are very stupid, and people who pull these out are extremely stupid and have no basis for their argument and that is obvious. 

That's why I am excited for this election cycle to be done with. I'm tired of hearing Hitler's, Mussolini's, and Stalin's name all the time. These names are barely brought up unless it is political season, and that is really sad.

Those people are illegally on this land to protest Donald Trump. Barack Obama passed legislation that makes this true.

via u/loli_trump

&gt; It is a pretty big criminal offense to protest at a Trump rally, why? Because Trump is protected by the USSS! Today Trump has stated that he wants and will start pressing charges on protesters attempting (and failing) to stump his rally, so Trump is going to Stump them real hard now! According to this article:
Current federal law (H.R. 347) does not allow for protesting of any type in an area under protection by the Secret Service.
When the federal law on trespass was quietly amended—it is a crime, punishable by up to a year in prison, to ""knowingly impede or disrupt the orderly conduct of Government business or official functions"" in locations guarded by the Secret Service, including places where individuals under Secret Service protection are temporarily located—the revised statute made it ""easier for the government to criminalize protest.

Most white supremacist aren't exactly far right. Far right is anarchism.  But that is not the point here. They love Trump because they are uniformed. Flat out. All they do is get their info from FoxNews and Facebook. They see that he wants to deport illegals and stop illegal immigration completely. He also wants to temporarily stop muslims from immigrating so we can make sure many of them arent ISIS. The FBI/CIA has confirmed that the refugees have many ISIS plants. Again, I am rambling. I believe the main reason they like Donald is because the are uniformed. Its kind of like how BLM hates Donald because they are uniformed. The media is perpetuating that Donald hates Blacks, when that is flat out false. That is why they[white supremacists] love him.

2666,"&gt; In 2011, the Government Accountability Office delivered a major report on criminal activity by unauthorized immigrants. The GAO was able to locate the arrest and sentencing records of roughly half the immigrants in local jails and state and federal prisons, and then sampled them to estimate what they contained. Here’s what it found:  

&gt; **An estimated 25,000 of these undocumented immigrants serving sentences for homicide. A cumulative total of 2.89 million offenses committed by these undocumented immigrants between 2003 and 2009 (although half a million of these were for immigration-related offenses)**


&gt; ***Among those offenses: An estimated 42,000 robberies, 70,000 sex crimes, 81,000 auto thefts, 95,000 weapons offenses, and 213,000 assaults***

2792,"&gt; In trying to recruit Chris Christie to his side, Marco Rubio offended the New Jersey governor shortly before he ended up endorsing Donald Trump, according to a New York Times report Saturday.

&gt; **Rubio reportedly left a message for Christie shortly after the governor ended his presidential campaign earlier this month, asking for his support and lauding his bright future in politics. Christie, 53, found it patronizing that a 44-year-old one-term senator saw fit to say such a thing, according to the Times. The two have apparently not spoken since.**
 
&gt; Trump ""made frequent calls to"" Christie after he dropped out, the Times reported, and the two men met up at Trump Tower on Thursday.
 
&gt; Christie then endorsed Trump during a campaign event in Texas on Friday.
 
&gt; The reports contradict Trump's claim Saturday morning that Christie initiated their conversations.
 
&gt; “Everybody wanted Chris,” Trump said on Fox News. “Chris called up out of the blue and said, ‘You’re the one that’s going to win.’ ”
 
&gt; Christie and Rubio clashed frequently during the presidential campaign. Christie frequently hammered Rubio as a mere legislator who doesn't have executive experience.
 
&gt; During a debate in early February, Christie seized on repetitive statements by Rubio to paint him as an over-scripted empty suit.

2810,"Here is my reasons for liking him. I had something typed up but I screwed up and it got deleted.

There are some stereotypical reasons for a lot of Trump supporters. The two I see the most are ""He doesn't care about PC."" and ""He doesn't care what people think."" Now these two reasons are fine reason to like him, but these are very low on my list. 

**Reasons Why I Like Trump**

**Reason 1:**

*Consistency*

Donald has been very consistent with his ideologies on this countries future for over twenty years now. In 1988 he went on [Oprah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1nkNzrUVeg#t=1m17s) and was asked about running for president. He said something along the lines of ""I'm not ready yet, but they way this country is going I may have to. I'm tired of losing in all of these trade deals to other countries.""  This is the current basis of his platform. Besides the wall, Donald is tired of losing in trade. It is costing us billions each year. Just a couple of days ago, Cruz claimed that Donald was for the invasion of Libya to overthrow Qaddafi back in 2011. That turned out to be a lie. Here are some tweets from Trump from 2011 regarding Qaddafi. [Pic](http://i.imgur.com/MhFbLza.jpg). Trump was against taking Qaddafi and predicted that something much worse would take his place. 

To play Devils advocate, Donald has changed his stances on some issues. This is what the GOP isn't doing. In order to survive, you must adapt to the times, and that is what Trump is doing. The GOP will die because they cannot adjust their views. They are way too stubborn.

**Reason 2:**

*He Is Not A Career Politician*

Now I'll tell you right now, I'm 19 years old. I haven't actively payed attention to many presidential elections because I was to young to care. But looking back, I have come to not care too much for career politicians. Their job is to get you to side with them. They hide behind their politicians smile and they seem to constantly be hiding things. In my experience with Trump thus far, he has not hid really anything from people. The media seems to be hiding the fact that he is very open. 

The United States would benefit from a non-career politician in my opinion. We seem to have way too many people who are owned by lobbyists and big banks. They seem not to care about the American people, but only care about pleasing their financial backers. Trump doesn't need any of that since he is self-funding. Not only that, but he has been millions of dollars under budget in his campaign thus far. 

Even if Trump ends up being a not so decent president, this would be a wake up call to the people who potentially want to run in the future. You aren't going to get buy with empty promises and a firm hand shake. You need to show people that you care about the interests of the people, not lobbyists. 

**I'm not here to change your mind on anything, and I wouldn't expect you to change your mind based on what a 19 year old college student wrote up on Reddit. I just feel like some of the Trump crowd is clouded up by all the dank memes over at r/the_Donald. Believe it or not, there are some very level headed people out there supporting Trump. We aren't all just 4chan users. A lot of us really care about the future of this country. Even more of us aren't total douches on the internet, as it may seem.**

TAX REFORM THAT WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN

The Goals Of Donald J. Trump’s Tax Plan

Too few Americans are working, too many jobs have been shipped overseas, and too many middle class families cannot make ends meet. This tax plan directly meets these challenges with four simple goals:

Tax relief for middle class Americans: In order to achieve the American dream, let people keep more money in their pockets and increase after-tax wages.
Simplify the tax code to reduce the headaches Americans face in preparing their taxes and let everyone keep more of their money.
Grow the American economy by discouraging corporate inversions, adding a huge number of new jobs, and making America globally competitive again.
Doesn’t add to our debt and deficit, which are already too large.
The Trump Tax Plan Achieves These Goals

If you are single and earn less than $25,000, or married and jointly earn less than $50,000, you will not owe any income tax. That removes nearly 75 million households – over 50% – from the income tax rolls. They get a new one page form to send the IRS saying, “I win,” those who would otherwise owe income taxes will save an average of nearly $1,000 each.
All other Americans will get a simpler tax code with four brackets – 0%, 10%, 20% and 25% – instead of the current seven. This new tax code eliminates the marriage penalty and the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) while providing the lowest tax rate since before World War II.
No business of any size, from a Fortune 500 to a mom and pop shop to a freelancer living job to job, will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes. This lower rate makes corporate inversions unnecessary by making America’s tax rate one of the best in the world.
No family will have to pay the death tax. You earned and saved that money for your family, not the government. You paid taxes on it when you earned it.
The Trump Tax Plan Is Revenue Neutral

The Trump tax cuts are fully paid for by:

Reducing or eliminating most deductions and loopholes available to the very rich.
A one-time deemed repatriation of corporate cash held overseas at a significantly discounted 10% tax rate, followed by an end to the deferral of taxes on corporate income earned abroad.
Reducing or eliminating corporate loopholes that cater to special interests, as well as deductions made unnecessary or redundant by the new lower tax rate on corporations and business income. We will also phase in a reasonable cap on the deductibility of business interest expenses.

DETAILS OF DONALD J. TRUMP’S TAX PLAN

America needs a bold, simple and achievable plan based on conservative economic principles. This plan does that with needed tax relief for all Americans, especially the working poor and middle class, pro-growth tax reform for all sizes of businesses, and fiscally responsible steps to ensure this plan does not add to our enormous debt and deficit.

This plan simplifies the tax code by taking nearly 50% of current filers off the income tax rolls entirely and reducing the number of tax brackets from seven to four for everyone else. This plan also reduces or eliminates loopholes used by the very rich and special interests made unnecessary or redundant by the new lower tax rates on individuals and companies.

The Trump Tax Plan: A Simpler Tax Code For All Americans

When the income tax was first introduced, just one percent of Americans had to pay it. It was never intended as a tax most Americans would pay. The Trump plan eliminates the income tax for over 73 million households. 42 million households that currently file complex forms to determine they don’t owe any income taxes will now file a one page form saving them time, stress, uncertainty and an average of $110 in preparation costs. Over 31 million households get the same simplification and keep on average nearly $1,000 of their hard-earned money.

For those Americans who will still pay the income tax, the tax rates will go from the current seven brackets to four simpler, fairer brackets that eliminate the marriage penalty and the AMT while providing the lowest tax rate since before World War II:

Income Tax Rate
Long Term Cap Gains/ Dividends Rate
Single Filers
Married Filers
Heads of Household
0%
0%
$0 to $25,000
$0 to $50,000
$0 to $37,500
10%
0%
$25,001 to $50,000
$50,001 to $100,000
$37,501 to $75,000
20%
15%
$50,001 to $150,000
$100,001 to $300,000
$75,001 to $225,000
25%
20%
$150,001 and up
$300,001 and up
$225,001 and up
With this huge reduction in rates, many of the current exemptions and deductions will become unnecessary or redundant. Those within the 10% bracket will keep all or most of their current deductions. Those within the 20% bracket will keep more than half of their current deductions. Those within the 25% bracket will keep fewer deductions. Charitable giving and mortgage interest deductions will remain unchanged for all taxpayers.

Simplifying the tax code and cutting every American’s taxes will boost consumer spending, encourage savings and investment, and maximize economic growth.

Business Tax Reform To Encourage Jobs And Spur Economic Growth

Too many companies – from great American brands to innovative startups – are leaving America, either directly or through corporate inversions. The Democrats want to outlaw inversions, but that will never work. Companies leaving is not the disease, it is the symptom. Politicians in Washington have let America fall from the best corporate tax rate in the industrialized world in the 1980’s (thanks to Ronald Reagan) to the worst rate in the industrialized world. That is unacceptable. Under the Trump plan, America will compete with the world and win by cutting the corporate tax rate to 15%, taking our rate from one of the worst to one of the best.

This lower tax rate cannot be for big business alone; it needs to help the small businesses that are the true engine of our economy. Right now, freelancers, sole proprietors, unincorporated small businesses and pass-through entities are taxed at the high personal income tax rates. This treatment stifles small businesses. It also stifles tax reform because efforts to reduce loopholes and deductions available to the very rich and special interests end up hitting small businesses and job creators as well. The Trump plan addresses this challenge head on with a new business income tax rate within the personal income tax code that matches the 15% corporate tax rate to help these businesses, entrepreneurs and freelancers grow and prosper.

These lower rates will provide a tremendous stimulus for the economy – significant GDP growth, a huge number of new jobs and an increase in after-tax wages for workers.

The Trump Tax Plan Ends The Unfair Death Tax

The death tax punishes families for achieving the American dream. Therefore, the Trump plan eliminates the death tax.

The Trump Tax Plan Is Fiscally Responsible

The Trump tax cuts are fully paid for by:

Reducing or eliminating deductions and loopholes available to the very rich, starting by steepening the curve of the Personal Exemption Phaseout and the Pease Limitation on itemized deductions. The Trump plan also phases out the tax exemption on life insurance interest for high-income earners, ends the current tax treatment of carried interest for speculative partnerships that do not grow businesses or create jobs and are not risking their own capital, and reduces or eliminates other loopholes for the very rich and special interests. These reductions and eliminations will not harm the economy or hurt the middle class. Because the Trump plan introduces a new business income rate within the personal income tax code, they will not harm small businesses either.
A one-time deemed repatriation of corporate cash held overseas at a significantly discounted 10% tax rate. Since we are making America’s corporate tax rate globally competitive, it is only fair that corporations help make that move fiscally responsible. U.S.-owned corporations have as much as $2.5 trillion in cash sitting overseas. Some companies have been leaving cash overseas as a tax maneuver. Under this plan, they can bring their cash home and put it to work in America while benefitting from the newly-lowered corporate tax rate that is globally competitive and no longer requires parking cash overseas. Other companies have cash overseas for specific business units or activities. They can leave that cash overseas, but they will still have to pay the one-time repatriation fee.
An end to the deferral of taxes on corporate income earned abroad. Corporations will no longer be allowed to defer taxes on income earned abroad, but the foreign tax credit will remain in place because no company should face double taxation.
Reducing or eliminating some corporate loopholes that cater to special interests, as well as deductions made unnecessary or redundant by the new lower tax rate on corporations and business income. We will also phase in a reasonable cap on the deductibility of business interest expenses.",2016-02-21 17:15:15+00:00,d088xi8,3.0,t1_d0877zk,2957.0,AdviceAnimals

2875,"Did anyone in these comments actually read the article or did you just look at the title??

The Real estate mogul then got the crowd excited with the promise of gory tales. **“You know, I read story — it’s a terrible story, but I’ll tell you,” Trump said. “Should I tell you? Or should I not?” The crowd, of course, cheered** and Trump began talking about “rough guy” Pershing who was fighting terrorists in the early 1900s. Although he didn’t specify, the online versions of the tale say it took place in the Philippines.

“They had a terrorism problems, just like we do,” Trump said. The front-runner for the Republican nomination never actually said the terrorists were Muslim, but he subtly noted: “And you know there’s a whole thing with swine and animals and pigs and you know the story, they don’t like that.”

Trump then goes on to tell the tale:

&gt; And he caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage and killed many people. And he took the 50 terrorists, and he took 50 men and he dipped 50 bullets in pigs’ blood — you heard that, right? He took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs’ blood. And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said: You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened. 

And for 25 years there wasn’t a problem. Okay? Twenty-five years, there wasn’t a problem.
**The moral of the story? “We better start getting tough and we better start getting vigilant and we better start using our heads or we’re not going to have a country folks.”**

&gt; **Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.** According to Pew Research, among others, there is great hatred towards Americans by large segments of the Muslim population. Most recently, a poll from the Center for Security Policy released data showing ""25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as a part of the global jihad"" and 51% of those polled, ""agreed that Muslims in America should have the choice of being governed according to Shariah."" Shariah authorizes such atrocities as murder against non-believers who won't convert, beheadings and more unthinkable acts that pose great harm to Americans, especially women.

&gt; Mr. Trump stated, ""Without looking at the various polling data, it is obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehension. Where this hatred comes from and why we will have to determine. Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life.

TFA was made to not only get you introduced to the main characters, but to get you hyped for the next two episodes.

Regarding the copy and paste of a storyline, it is very cookie cutter, but it is needed to develop Kylo Ren's character. If he wants to be just like Vader and follow his path, creating the star killer base would be the best way. He created a more powerful base than the deathstar and failed which will lead him to want to do something even more drastic.
