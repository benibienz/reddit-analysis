That is bullshit.

How is that not political motivation?

Snopes has no credibility. Make sure you tell people who use Snopes as a ""fact checker"" they are no longer reliable. 

They even try to turn this video to somehow make everyone who shared it look to be a racist. No. That isnt how this works.

I found it so easy to resist food and other temptations.

I'm making his post because I know there are people on the fence about starting Keto, or are struggling to get back on Keto (including me).

I'm currently sitting at about 220-225 last I checked, which was about 3 days ago. At the beginning of the summer I was at 205. 

The decline all started when someone asked if I ever was going to stop being anorexic. It really pissed me off. I dedicated myself to a healthy lifestyle. I counted calories and worked out everyday. And just because they couldn't do what I did, they decided to put me down.

I'll tell you how I got there. Eating like a slob and constantly finding excuses to skip the gym. I make constant excuses to eat like crap.

I haven't been on strict Keto in almost 6-8 months. I feel like trash. I have constant heart burn, I can't sleep, and my studying is on decline. My mental health is taking hit. 

I was so happy when weight was falling off. Now I just feel alone and slightly depressed. 

That's all ending today. I'm going back to the gym tomorrow. I'm going back on IF and Keto. I'm not having diet pop anymore. No more drinking. No more giving into peer pressure. No more excuses I'm going back to my stubborn ways. 

If you're thinking about starting Keto, start today. 

If you are like me and are trying to get back on it, start today. 

You know how good it feels to be at the top of the mountain, don't let others drag you back down. 

I'm going back to being happy, and I really don't give a shit what other people say. I really hope you decide to do the same. ",keto,"I've screwed up big time.

7. Right Click and click properties. 

8. Navigate to Compatibility

9. Click Run as Admin.

This worked for me. I'm currently running at 60 fps at all times, I can run at higher FPS, but I only have a 60 hz monitor. 

Sorry to AMD users, I'm not sure what to do for you guys. I'm sure there are similar steps.

It pisses me off to no end that all of the Millenial generation (which I'm a part of) sucks both of them off. What have either of them done? Obama has made it 10 times harder to get medical insurance you actually want. He's made race relations worse than they have been in years. The poor are getting poorer. Crime is increasing. Terrorism is increasing. Corruption in politics is becoming more noticeable, and no one seems to care. The Middle East has become even more of a shit hole. 

While Obama is off playing golf, or Hillary is off taking naps, people are struggling harder than they have before, yet I'm sure they will still vote democrat.

The identity politics they have adopted is Cancer to our country. It is creating civil unrest and racial tension. People are not feeling safe in today's America. The rise in political correctness is basically killing people at this point. Not calling out radical Islamists in their bullshit because people do not want to be ""xenophobic"" enrages me. 

I'm tired of having Barack Obama come up to a podium and stutter for 15 seconds. I'm tired of him putting cops down, and raising felons up. I'm tired of democrats in general saying ""America is great!"" Is it? Is it really? Go ask you voter base how well they are doing, jackasses. 

I'm tired of the DNC's corruption being glossed over by the media and by my dipshit fellow Milenialls. I'm tired of the DNC and their voters blaming everything that is wrong in their life on everybody but themselves. 

I'm tired of nothing changing in Washington because the same career politicians keep coming in like a revolving door of morons. I'm tired of them being bought by foreign governments. I'm tired of them being flat out incompetent. Almost 100% of the time they have absolutely no clue what the hell they are doing.

I'm tired of being subject to character assassination for supporting Republican candidates, specifically Donald J Trump. I'm tired of being shunned for loving this country to death. I'm tired of being discouraged to be proud as hell in my country. 

I'm done with having people who give their life for mine being forgotten. I'm tired of our vets dying on the streets waiting for healthcare. I'm tired of Black Lives Matter inciting violence among its supporters. I'm tired of having people who protect me every day being fearful of their lives because of some jackasses. I'm tired of BLM ignoring the Black on Black crime all over this country. Yes, I realize that BLM is supposed to be ""protesting police violence"" but they only care when it is a white cop killing a black man, which is bullshit. I'm tired of BLM basing their movement off of felons who were attacking cops at the time they were shot. I'm tired of BLM using Trayvon Martin as a pawn, even though he was shot by a Mexican American civilian. I'm tired of seeing article headlines like ""Black man shot by white cops for selling CDs."" or ""Black man shot by white cops for selling cigarettes."" The media is the biggest divider in this country. 


I'm tired of the main stream media being owned and operated by the DNC. I can't stand waking up in the morning and hearing political hacks on TV lie straight to my face. I can't take it anymore. We have to win this election. 

I'm tired of education centers being liberal breeding grounds. They do not let other ideas thrive and often put them down. I'm tired of people who get social justice degrees complaining about not being able to find work. I'm a computer science major. I'll be able to find steady work when I finish school, and I actually earned it. I don't need these crybullies getting pushed up to my level when I worked hard for my degree and they took Women's Studies 101. Computer science majors in Ohio usually average 15-20 dollars a hour coming out of school. I don't need the Barista from Starbucks earning as much as me.

I'm tired of crybullies telling other people, especially minorities, how they should feel. Frankly, it's completely retarded and often is racist. 

I'm tired of criminals being put on a pedestal for being ""brave enough to cross the border."" I'm tired of drugs infesting my city and ruining and potentially killing my friends. I'm tired of heroin crossing the border and hearing about overdoses from students at local high schools.

I'm tired of us taking care of other countries. I'm tired of having other countries push us around and tell us how we should feel, when they know nothing about what it is to be an American. I'm tired of this ""globalization"" that is in fact just a cover word for global imperialism. 

I'm tired of having unfair trade policies that usually end with us feeding entire countries. At this point out number one export is food. We used to be known for such more. We used to be the export capital of the world. Now look at us. Buying cheap shit from (basically) slave shops in China and Mexico.   

I'm not going to lie, I'm well off. But I know plenty of people who aren't. I'm pissed that these people might not ever get to experience what I have because of failed democrat policies. I'm tired of seeing these ""leaders"" faces all the time when all they do is promise bullshit and never ever deliver.

After being tired of all this bullshit, a shot to the heart named Donald J Trump has woken me up and gave me actual hope that all that shit will change.

We need real change. We need someone to tear up this system and replace it with something new. We need to get rid of all the corrupt people in Washington. That is why we need to elect Donald Trump. Electing Trump will be the first step to getting rid of everything I mentioned I was tired of. 

Bernie Sanders kept saying how his campaign was a revolution. No, it isnt. He went and endorsed the source of all the corruption and problems in Washington.

We have the real revolution here. We are going to end all this shit and throw Hillary Rotten Clinton in jail for her corruption, and I can't wait until that day.

**TLDR:** TOO MUCH BULLSHIT GOING ON.

In the last semester of this school year I started working out everyday. I was on the verge of getting rid of the fat on my stomach and getting to my ultimate goal. I had gained 12 pounds of muscle during that time, putting me at 205 Hell, I could even see a little bit of a six pack. 

Suddenly, finals week came around and Keto was the least of my worries. I kept working out every morning, but my diet was awful. It continued up until today. I really haven't gained much, but I have definitely noticed.

Im just annoyed with myself for letting it get this far. 8-10 pounds doesn't seem like much, but it is when it isn't muscle. 

I kept saying things like ""I'll start tomorrow"" or ""Its no big deal if I eat these fries, I've lost a lot of weight.""

3-4 months of being off Keto hasn't been kind. 

I'm going back to school soon where it is MUCH easier to live a Keto lifestyle, so starting today will hopefully get me into Ketosis by the time I get back. When I get to my ultimate goal I'll be sure to update.

9/11 was carried out by Muslim terrorists and killed and injured thousands of people. Instead of guns, planes were used. Do we have a plane control issue?

The Boston Bombing was carried out by Muslim terrorists and killed 3 people and injured over 250. Instead of guns, nails in a pressure cooker was used as a bomb. Should this attack be considered a nail and pressure cooker control issue?

The Brussels attack was carried out by Muslim Terrorists. They killed 35 people and injured over 300. A bomb was used. Should this attack be considered a bomb control issue?

The Paris attack was carried out by Muslim Terrorists. They killed 130 people and injured hundreds more. Guns were used. Keep in mind that Paris has strict gun control laws and the theatre it occurred in was a gun free zone. Was this a gun control issue?

The Charlie Hebdo attacks were carried out by Muslim Terrorists. 12 people were killed and 11 were injured. The attacks were carried out with Guns and Rocket Launchers. They also occurred in a strict gun control area and gun free zone. Was this a gun control issue?

Finally,

The Orlando attack was a Muslim Terrorist Attack. They killed 50 people and injured 53 more. They targeted a gay night club that was also a gun free zone. The terrorist used an AR-15 and a pistol. How is this considered a ""gun control issue"" when the others are not?

All of these attacks have one thing in common: Islam.

It doesn't matter what weapon is used. The problem here is Islam. Not weapons.

Cincinnatus was a Roman Patrician (rich guy) during the Roman Republic. He was a farmer who was very wealthy. He was seen as ""one of the heroes of early Rome and as a model of Roman virtue and simplicity.""

Cincinnatus was known as a patriot in the Roman Republic. During times of crisis, the Roman Senate would elect a ""Dictator"" to take control of the government. Cincinnatus took over in a time of invasion. He defeated the invaders in 2 weeks and handed the dictatorship back and went to working on his farm. He was called back to be Dictator many times and gave it back every single time.

Cincinnatus was a true patriot and only came to power to save his country. He did not want the power, like Trump. He had to do it in order to make Rome a better place.

Julius Ceaser was a bad dude. He killed thousands and did a lot of bad things. Was he a good leader? Sure. But he was no Cincinnatus.

George Washington is also compared to Cincinnatus. He did not want to be the first leader of the US. He only did it to help the country get on its feet after a ""crisis"".

Donald is not doing this for the power. He is not doing this for the history books. He has accomplished both of those things. He is in it for the true betterment of this country, unlike Ceaser. Ceaser was in it for the power. Cincinnatus was in it for the betterment of the Republic. George Washington was in it for the betterment of the United States. 

That is what Donald J Trump is like. He wants to Make America Great Again. He is not in it for himself. He is in it for **US.**

&gt; **""Think big.""**

&gt; If you're satisfied knowing that you can comfortably make a deal that doesn't require much effort, then you're not thinking big enough.

&gt; ""Most people think small, because most people are afraid of success, afraid of making decisions, afraid of winning,"" he writes. ""And that gives people like me a great advantage.""

&gt; **""Protect the downside and the upside will take care of itself.""**

&gt; Trump learned that he would rather own casinos than be a gambler himself.

&gt; ""I always go into the deal anticipating the worst,"" he writes. ""If you plan for the worst — if you can live with the worst — the good will always take care of itself.""

&gt; ""The only time in my life I didn't follow that rule was with the USFL [the defunct United States Football League]. I bought a losing team in a losing league on a long shot. It almost worked, through our antitrust suit, but when it didn't, I had no fallback. The point is that you can't be too greedy.""

&gt; Get into deals that you can afford to recover from if things go poorly, and know when the opportunity cost for making a small deal is lower than had you not made a deal at all.

&gt; **""Maximize your options.""**

&gt; **It's necessary to be flexible**, he says.

&gt; ""I never get too attached to one deal or one approach,"" Trump writes. ""For starters, I keep a lot of balls in the air, because most deals fall out, no matter how promising they seem at first. In addition, once I've made a deal, I always come up with at least a half dozen approaches to making it work, because anything can happen, even to the best-laid plans.""

&gt; **""Know your market.""**

&gt; Trump says that he likes to rely on his own research rather than the work of consultants, statisticians, or critics. He says that he's made it a habit to collect himself as many opinions as possible about a potential real estate deal to see how it will affect the area and who it will be catering to.

&gt; ""Trump Tower is a building the critics were skeptical about before it was built, but which the public obviously liked,"" he writes. ""I'm not talking about the sort of person who inherited money 175 years ago and lives on 84th Street and Park Avenue. I'm talking about the wealthy Italian with the beautiful wife and the red Ferrari. Those people — the audience I was after — came to Trump Tower in droves.""

&gt; **""Use your leverage.""**

&gt; The only way you're going to make the deal you want, he says, is if you're coming from a position of strength and can convince the other side that you have something they need.

&gt; Trump says he's not afraid to blur reality to utilize leverage. ""When the board of Holiday Inn was considering whether to enter into a partnership with me in Atlantic City, they were attracted to my site because they believed my construction was farther along than that of any other potential partner.""

&gt; ""In reality,"" he writes, ""I wasn't that far along, but I did everything I could, short of going to work at the site myself, to assure them that my casino was practically finished. My leverage came from confirming an impression they were already predisposed to believe.""

&gt; **""Enhance your location.""**

&gt; Trump says that the adage that location is everything in real estate isn't true.

&gt; ""You can take a mediocre location and turn it into something considerably better just by attracting the right people,"" he writes, explaining that this is what he did with the Trump Plaza location in New York City's Upper East Side. He took the glamour of his Fifth Avenue location, where it wasn't hard to sell luxury, and used its name brand to sell apartments to the same audience in a much less glamorous location.

&gt; Taken beyond the real estate industry, his main point is that rather than overpay for something that is already established, you should consider cheaper alternatives that have the potential to be molded to your taste.

&gt; **""Get the word out.""**

&gt; Once you've made a deal, the only way it's going to be worth anything is to then attract customers, he says. Similarly, creating a public persona helps you get the most out of your next deals.

&gt; Trump says that he's always embraced a healthy dose of sensationalism and controversy to pique the media's interest.

&gt; **""I play to people's fantasies,"" he writes. ""People may not always think big themselves, but they can still get very excited by those who do. That's why a little hyperbole never hurts. People want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular.""**

&gt; **""Fight back.""**

&gt; Trump says that he prefers to be cooperative and positive, but that sometimes it's necessary to be confrontational when the other side is treating him unfairly or trying to take advantage of him.

&gt; ""The risk is that you'll make a bad situation worse, and I certainly don't recommend this approach to everyone,"" he writes. ""But my experience is that if you're fighting for something you believe in — even if it means alienating some people along the way — things usually work out for the best in the end.""

&gt; **""Deliver the goods.""**

&gt; ""You can't con people, at least not for long,"" Trump writes. ""You can create excitement, you can do wonderful promotion and get all kinds of press, and you can throw in a little hyperbole. But if you can't deliver the goods, people will eventually catch on.""

&gt; **""Contain the costs.""**

&gt; Trump explains that his father taught him to never pay a penny more than you should for something, since pennies can easily turn into dollars.

&gt; From observing his competitors, he writes, he's found that throwing money at a project is never the path to success if it was shoddily planned.

&gt; **""Have fun.""**

&gt; Successful deal-making should be about the thrill of winning and accomplishing something, not solely for making money, Trump says.

&gt; ""Money was never a big motivation for me, except as a way to keep score,"" he writes. ""The real excitement is playing the game.""

It's fun to watch this campaign unfold right in front of us. Especially if you have read this.

I find this part of it most interesting:

""Deliver the goods.""

""You can't con people, at least not for long,"" Trump writes. ***""You can create excitement, you can do wonderful promotion and get all kinds of press, and you can throw in a little hyperbole. But if you can't deliver the goods, people will eventually catch on.""***

The Beginning of the New Year is a very critical time in many peoples lives. A lot of people are coming up with resolutions that may or may not fizzle out into nothing. I thought I was one of those people. Last year, on January 1st, I told myself that I would lose weight at some point in the year. 


I'm not going to bore you with the backstory too much, but It may end up being that way. 


I have been overweight my entire life, but my junior year of High School is where it got even worse. I suffered two injuries to each shoulder  (torn labrums) which sidelined me from most physical activity. For the most part football workouts kept me from going too far over the edge, but I fell right off when I couldn't do anything. I slowly gained weight going from around 245-250 to 282 over the course of the year. 


**Back to Early 2015**


I was browsing reddit for pages to not only keep me motivated, but to give me good advice. I ended up finding r/keto and r/fitness . I immediately jumped on the keto train and lost 40 pounds in a little over two months. By the end of my senior year, I was at 215. When I got to school, I was determined to lose the freshman 15 instead of gain it. I actually ended up losing 20 pounds instead leading me to where I am today. 


**Weights &amp; Other Fitness Stuff**


Due to the shoulder surgeries I wasn't able to do much in the way of weights. I was able to run though and would try to run a mile everyday. I worked at Walmart as a cart pusher during most of the time I was losing weight and I credit that job to most of the weight loss. I would normally walk 13-15 miles per shift. However, I did start weight training and I've been able to do quite a few things I had never been able to do before.  

On bench, I started with being able to do just above the bar, around 55(max before surgery was 285)pounds. I've slowly worked to around 185x5 on three sets.

I had never been able to do a pullup until recently. I can now do 5x5 on three sets.

I have always struggled to do pushups, and started at being able to do 1. I can now do 20 for 3 sets. 

The losing weight part of my plan is complete, now i just need to finish step two and get my body right. As you could probably see in the body progress pic in the album, I have a little bit of extra skin/stubborn fat on my stomach that I am determined to get rid of.

I went go from size 40 pants to size 32 and from wearing 2XLs shirts pretty tight to now wearing Larges pretty loose. 


**TL;DR**


A lot of people are browsing subs like r/keto , r/fitness , r/loseit because it is the start of the year. I seriously encourage people to follow through with that they plan on doing. Browse the subs daily for motivation. Post progress. Tell other people about you plans. That is what I did and it ended up working. It will be a very slow transition and transformation, just be patient. Your patience will pay off. 

If you have any questions or need any advice or have any questions don't hesitate to ask, I am extremely happy to help.

He did what most people losing in that situation do, run offsides to block the kick and then quit. He sat right in front of the kicker and blocked the kick. My QB picked it up and I immediately jumped on the ground. I then accepted the penalty so I could re kick. But it sent the game to overtime, he got the ball and returned it for a touchdown. I have never been so pissed at the game. Is there a way I can refute the loss to get a win instead?

Here's the transformation: http://imgur.com/eFdDhNL.jpg

The left is around 282 and the right is 195.

**Background:** I was browsing reddit one day and found r/keto and eventually found r/loseit in the process and it changed my life. I am 18 years old and had always been extremely overweight up until March of this year. I had enough with the extra,unnecessary weight. The most I ever weighed was 282 pounds and around 40 in the waist. I found myself completely shredding the weight after I started and lost about 40 pounds in 2 months. It was hard to keep the diet in school since the cafeteria didn't exactly cater to a high fat and protein diet. 

**The Diet:** Counting calories and macros wasn't exactly my thing so I just decided to wing it. It ended up helping me in the end since I wasn't constantly stressing about reaching the daily intake goals. My parents would cook me a ton of chicken and burgers for the week that I could throw in the microwave. For the first few months all I ate was meat and the occasional salad.

**Exercise:** I really didn't do all that much in the line of working out at the gym. I played football in High School so I occasionally went to the weight room but I'm pretty sure it had no effect on the weight loss. Most of the weight was lost while I worked at Wal-Mart. My Fitbit said that my average miles walked on a normal shift was around 16 miles and I would work everyday. That definitely had a huge impact on my loss. 

**Advice:** My biggest piece of advice for anyone trying to lose weight is to tell as many people as you can about your plans. One of the reasons I have been able to lose weight for so long was because of all the people who constantly checked in on my status. If people think that you starting to try and lose weight is stupid, just ignore them. I encountered a few of those people myself through my journey.  The best part about that was most of them were about the same size as me. Just don't let other people get you down.

I'm planning to keep on going and get fit relatively soon to help get to my new goal of 180 and. hopefully I can bulk up after I get to the new goal.

Just solve for x: y^2 - 18y = x^2  - 81

If you do want to print any covers I make out I would suggest doing it at a place like Meijer or Walmart.
