8,"No. Most likely not. However, living without them will give you a huge confidence boost and it WILL help even if it doesn't take it away completely. A lot of guys on here say that it ""cured"" their social anxiety, but it really just depends on if you have SA even without PMO. I had social anxiety even when on a long streak, but it still helped knowing I could look people in the eye and not feel like I had something to hide.

11,"Social anxiety is almost always going to be fixed with some cognitive restructuring (as well as nofap, because if you feel ashamed of yourself, then you will never be able to be confident socially). A lot of people experience social anxiety, perhaps because so many people in our generation are so used to hiding behind screens? However, you TRULY can overcome it! I did and I never thought it would happen but it did and people around me notice. One of the best things (besides abstaining from activities known to produce feelings of guilt and self-hatred) is trying to think from the other person's point of view. Mentally switch roles and try to think of how you would react to what was being said by the other person if they were saying what you said. (Let me know if I should clarify more, it's not that easy to explain over the internet.) Most people react to situations in relatively the same way. So though you may be thinking they are judging you or analyzing you, the majority of the time they are simply listening with no negative thoughts toward you. It also helps to try to learn new things and read often so that you have a plethora of things to talk about it most situations. If you truly fuck up somehow, just remember that you will most likely never see that person again and move on. Keep pushing yourself, it gets easier my friend!",2015-07-17 05:21:08+00:00,ct69il7,1,t3_3dlae5,2142,NoFap

20,"No, honestly, if you use that it will calm you down yes. Similar to mild alcohol intake, you would be more relaxed and somewhat careless of what people think. It sounds great right? But trust me on this, it won't ACTUALLY help with your social anxiety. In the moment you will feel more confident sure, but in the long run you will become reliant on it. It's much MUCH better imo to see a therapist who specializes in CBT and social phobias. You willl learn to control your social anxiety on your own, which will help you enormously for long-term progress and confidence.

27,"It may help to turn on a camera and practice speaking in front of it. You will learn how to speak more clearly when you watch it and practice a bit. (Don't worry if your voice sounds weird to you, everyone thinks their recorded voice is strange.) Also, I would record your progress with the speaking every day, maybe asking questions such as, ""How did I do today?"" ""What kinds of feelings were going on as I talked to so-so?"" Identifying anything that influences your speaking would be really helpful for changing it. Also, it's ok to increase calories to gain, but do so carefully. A friend of mine (6'4"") went from 145 to 200. He has a major sweet tooth, but 90% of the time he is eating meat and rice. Try to choose things that are calorie dense, but healthy.
