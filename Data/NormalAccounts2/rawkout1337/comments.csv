29,"It was because I was doing this out by hand originally and wanted to use smaller numbers when changing the variable (how many birds in the stack). 

The equation I ended up using was 

(Bird A Height x Number of bird in stack)+(Bird n Height x Number of birds in stack)...= Total height of stack

1.261B/Total Height of Stack=Number of stacks needed

Number of stacks needed x Number of birds in stack=Minimum number of species needed

I figured the most efficient way to calculate this would be to divide the birds into units (stacks) and have a certain number of each bird in a stack. Then I just needed to figure out how many stacks it would take to reach the moon. As long as the total number of each species didn't exceed their individual populations it could work.

But, I had to figure out how many birds of each species were on Earth. It all kind of went downhill from there...

302,"The Double Cross started as the front section of the Longshot with some pretty heavy modifications. 

I cut up the main body and used the upper half for the arms of the bow. The whole thing was strong, but I did not feel comfortable having the tenstion from the rubber tube pulling on it. Instead, I placed a metal rod in the center and attached the tube to both ends. This distributed the force from the tube when it is under tension.

I added a piece of plastic for the Rebelle arrow to rest on/make release more stable. This was heat bent into shape.

I then made a custom trigger assembly that holds the tube in the ""ready to fire"" position. This was by far the hardest part of the whole build, but in the end it worked really well. The trigger releases the dart when it is bumped backwards by your thumb, so you can fire the dart and the arrow simultaneously.

Lastly, I had some issues with the Rebelle arrow rolling out of the way when playing with it. So I added a piece of square plastic to hold the arrow in place, that way you can even shoot it upside down!

The whole thing was very much a ""I wonder if I could make a crossbow"" and definitely helped inform my decisions on The Guardian crossbow which I built next. Also, this build predated the Elite Crossbolt by a few months, so I was pleasantly surprised when I saw it.",2016-01-30 14:21:09+00:00,czhjqau,2.0,t1_czhjdmt,967,Nerf

The electronics should be relatively straight forward, I would assume less than $10 for all the parts at volume. If you are looking to make a prototype yourself, expect it to cost a bit more.

The famed ""Golden Grasshopper"" weathervane was placed atop Faneuil Hall in 1742. From this perch, the grasshopper has witnessed the remarkable growth of the city and over 260 years of American history in the making.
In 1761, a fire at Faneuil Hall damaged the grasshopper weathervane. Thomas Drowne, a blacksmith and the son of the grasshopper's creator, repaired the weathervane and inserted a ""time capsule"" in its stomach. The capsule, which is engraved ""Food for the Grasshopper,"" includes historical newspapers, coins, and messages from mayors that have been added as the grasshopper has been periodically refurbished.

519,"**1- That Japanese steel was/is the best in the world.** Japan has pretty limited iron and they were able to make it into passable steel through a complicated process of refinement and selective forging. The strength we attribute to Japanese blades has more to do with their carefully laminated structure and physical shape than the quality of the steel. Here is a [great video](https://youtu.be/VE_4zHNcieM?t=194) showing the process of refining iron sand into Japanese steel (tamahagane)

**2- Damascus steel only comes from Damascus.** This is more a semantic argument, but it is still important. What people (and many commercial metal manufacturers and suppliers) commonly refer to as ""Damascus Steel"" is actually a process called ""pattern welding"" and it can be done anywhere. It is only called Damascus steel if it was forged in Damascus (similar to how Champagne is only Champagne if it is grown/bottled in the French region) and as /u/Hergrim pointed out below, true Damascus steel is a special type of wootz crucible steel. 

**3- That Indian/Persian steel was quenched in ""saline"" by stabbing hot blades into prisoners or slaves.** Thats not how blade heat treating works. At all.

To prevent false alarms we designed the physical device so that it would be difficult to activate accidentally and responds to a deliberate activation sequence (eg. for a tier two alert: sliding the trigger up once briefly, back down, then up for 3 seconds). 

We are also currently developing the protocol for Public Safety's response to alerts by collaborating with multiple colleges' safety departments. Currently, the protocol is to contact the student when a tier 2 alert is issued, so if a false alarm is somehow activated it will quickly be recognised, however we are still developing this aspect of the device as we talk to more colleges. 

Regarding abusing the system: Students can already contact public safety and file reports, our device streamlines the communication process and seeks to improve response time for campus officers. It would be no different than a student filing a false report with public safety.

533,"In the first event you described: A bunch of students could theoretically file reports and have a public safety officer dispatched, but I am not sure what the end goal would be? Luring one or two security guards off campus wouldn't really be a huge deal.

The second situation: The app only relays your location to the public safety app, not to your emergency contact. The text feature is just to let someone know to check in on you (a common feature of most safety apps) and they would have no way of knowing where you are. 

Also you are severely underestimating campus security on point #4. If public safety responded to an alert and then couldn't actually locate the student I can guarantee you they wouldn't leave until they found them (and honestly, a missing student would just draw more attention)

C- Its not like public safety would dispatch every single person on staff to a location. Protocol is usually to send one or two officers to a situation. 

D- I am not sure what you mean by ""bait,"" but I am guessing you mean luring an officer? Again, full accountability; public safety would know who initiated the alert.

586,"Hey thanks!

So: I am a (recently graduated) Industrial Designer currently working freelance for a small firm and some private clients on the side (hopefully launching a kickstarter soon!). I briefly worked as an intern for a large company in their model shop helping to prototype and facilitate projects and I will hopefully be joining them again at the end of the year for some more work.

While at school I was an avid metalworker, experimenting with everything from hand machining metal to welding and bladesmithing. I am currently exploring ways to continue metalworking at home and will probably be constructing a small backyard forge and expanding my basement workbench. 

A normal day for me can vary significantly depending on what step of the design process I am at or if I am just making something for myself.

If I am in the beginning phases of a project, I am usually researching and brainstorming or meeting with clients. These are the days where having an iPad is so useful, as I am often running from place to place and taking copious notes. 

Once I get into the ideation/prototyping phase of a project I start getting my hands dirty and the safety equipment is so important. I often work with clay or foam to create rough form mockups. I also work with wood, metal, and plastic. I have recently obtained a 3D printer and it has been VERY helpful. If a project requires it, I can also do some light electrical work (soldering, basic circuits, basic coding, Arduino/Raspi stuff). This is also the heavy sketching period where my markers and sketchbooks come in to play. 

In the final stages of a project I will start the heavy digital work which means the laptop and mouse are hooked up and running 24/7. I make CAD models in Solidworks and do graphic design, layouts, and marketing images in Adobe Suite programs. 

TL;DR as an Industrial Designer, I have to be a jack of all trades and there is no normal day. The more processes and materials I am comfortable with, the broader range of products I can work on and things I can make for myself.

* [**Wacom Bamboo Stylus(Pictured) and Tablet(Not Pictured)**](http://www.engadget.com/products/wacom/bamboo/fun/1st-gen/) A great drawing tablet I can throw in my bag and was relatively cheap so I donât need to worry too much about breaking it.

* [**Dell Mouse**](http://www.amazon.com/Dell-X7636-Button-Scroll-Mouse/dp/B000MS1VZS) A free mouse from work that I feel totally comfortable ruining or using on a table covered in metal shavings, paint, or foam dust. Plus no batteries!

* **iPad 3rd gen with Apple Smart Case** I bring this on days I donât want to carry/donât need my laptop. Really great for light design work and sketching for clients. (Soon to be related by an iPad pro and Apple Pencil.)

* **Apple Wireless Keyboard** *not pictured* On days when I know I am going to be meeting a client or taking a lot of notes I bring my keyboard. 

* **15â Macbook Pro, Early 2011 with Speck case** Main workhorse. Currently running osX and Windows 7 via Bootcamp (for Solidworks and gaming)


*Pencil Cases Below Laptop and contents*

* [**Global Canvas Pencil Cases; 24 and 48 capacity**](http://www.dickblick.com/products/global-canvas-pencil-cases/) Solid cases that have stood up to a good amount of wear and can (very snugly) fit 24 markers in the 48 capacity case.

* **Pink Eraser** *not pictured*

* **Two Prismacolour markers, Grey.**

* **Micron Pens, black.** 0.3, 0.5, 0.8. *Not pictured, 0.005*

* [**Faber-Castell Pitt Brush Pen**](http://www.dickblick.com/products/faber-castell-pitt-artist-pens/) A solid brush pen I used back when I was into illustration. Great for outlining.

* [**Papermate Tuff-Stuff Eraser Stick**](http://www.dickblick.com/products/paper-mate-tuff-stuff-eraser-stick/) Worth itâs weight in gold.
 
* [**Zebra F-301 Steel Pen**](http://www.staples.com/Zebra-F-301-Stainless-Steel-Retractable-Ballpoint-Pens-Fine-Point-Black-2/product_270975?cid=PS:GooglePLAs:270975&amp;ci_src=17588969&amp;ci_sku=270975&amp;KPID=270975&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQjwvdSvBRDahavi3KPGrvUBEiQATZ9v0MGLNM8MZkIRIprGTHA9M9sYx_CvgvfvwBYql3Zh71saApfS8P8HAQ&amp;kpid=270975) A great pen with fantastic line quality and very low bleeding.

* [**Zebra M-301 Steel Mechanical Pencil**](http://www.staples.com/Zebra-M301-Mechanical-Pencils-5-mm-Silver-Barrel-2-Pack/product_399584?cid=PS:GooglePLAs:399584&amp;ci_src=17588969&amp;ci_sku=399584&amp;KPID=399584&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQjwvdSvBRDahavi3KPGrvUBEiQATZ9v0O8opAeD5sorasf8nrHIZNcfiP1doZlmAR2RVM-pKGUaAmZC8P8HAQ&amp;kpid=399584) I have this thing stuffed with two refills worth of lead but the eraser refill are $7 so I carry the Tuff-Stuff eraser instead. 

* [**6â Machinist ruler**](http://www.amazon.com/PEC-Flexible-Stainless-Machinist-Engineer/dp/B00AG7XYF0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1442166212&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=6+machinist+ruler) From my machining days. As good as clippers in a pinch. Accurate up to 1/100th and 1/64th of an inch depending on which side you use. 

* **6â Acrylic Ruler with Magnifying lens** and **Engineers Field Book Assistant** A cheap ruler with a little magnifying bubble on one end. It has a black line running through the center that is 0.5â wide which is also useful for making quick grids. I also have a really useful curve tool/protractor combo. If anyone has any info on what its actual product name is or where I can get another one: let me know in case I ever need to replace this one. *see additional photos*

* **Like 24 goddamn prisma markers** I carry a complete 10-90% Cool Grey set as well as a few select colours and a few warm/neutral greys as well. 


*To the right of the backpack and laptop, top to bottom*


* [**Belkin Cable Organiser from my old backpack**](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001586UI2?tag=bestlaptbackr-20) Ok this was my favourite backpack in the world up until a few months ago. I have owned two of them and had both of the zippers fail in the same spot so I decided to throw in the towel. That being said, they came with this nifty cable organiser case. 

* [**Toshiba 1TB Portable Drive and cable**](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822149191) This drive is super reliable. I added industrial velcro to it/my laptop case so I can mount the drive to my laptop and not worry about accidentally picking up the computer and unplugging the drive (personal experience!)

* **Apple Macbook pro 85w Charger with cable extension and two prong adapter** I usually need the extra two feet from the extension, but in the event I come across a two prong outlet I have the other adapter.

* **Apple 30Pin Cable and USB Charger** For days when I have the iPad. 

* **Apple Thunderbolt to VGA** I became known as âthe guy with the dongleâ in college because of this thing. *not pictured, 30 pin to VGA for iPad days*

* [**Two A4 Format Moleskines. (One with green tape, one with Caution tape)**](http://www.moleskine.com/en/collections/model/product/folio-sketchbook-a4) The green-tape one is my primary sketchbook and the caution-tape one is gridded and is primarily used in a shop setting. Inside of each cover I have created references: In my sketchbook I have a complete pallet of my available marker colours/pen widths. In the shop notebook I have a drill reference/decimal equivalent chart. Got this free from the place we ordered steel from in college. *see additional photos*

* **Safety Glasses!** because to that piece of whatever flying through the air, your eye is like warm cream cheese with a target on it.

* **3DS Games and an Altoids tin** Currently carrying Fire Emblem, Ocarina of Time, Super Mario64, Tales of the Abyss and Super Smash Bros 4 (in the 3DS). Gotta keep entertained on the go. 

* **Microfiber cloth/shammy** A reversible piece of swag from an Autodesk booth at a trade show.

* **Headphone Splitter** Because you never know when youâll need it. 

* **Reusable Ear protection!** I used to spend a lot of time using the power hammer in the metal shop doing bladesmithing. That thing was LOUD. Equally useful if I am using power tools, but my headphones do a pretty great job isolating sound. 

* [**Mophie Pack**](http://www.bestbuy.com/site/mophie-powerstation-mini-external-battery-black/5937328.p?id=1218708012417&amp;skuId=5937328&amp;ref=06&amp;loc=01&amp;ci_src=14110944&amp;ci_sku=5937328&amp;extensionType=pla:g&amp;s_kwcid=PTC!pla!!!117595374975!g!!64983312135&amp;kpid=5937328&amp;k_clickid=2890b0fb-a323-26c9-423b-0000535b0ef4&amp;lsft=ref:212,loc:1&amp;ksid=2890b0fb-a323-26c9-423b-0000535b0ef4&amp;ksprof_id=10&amp;ksaffcode=pg12963&amp;ksdevice=c&amp;kpid=5937328) Always handy. Can top up my iPad in a pinch.

* [**Southord Lock Pick set**](http://www.southord.com/Lock-Pick-Tools/Jackknife-Pocket-Lock-Pick-Sets.html) Between getting locked out of my apartment in the snow and working as a handyman at a real estate office (people lose their keys a LOT), this has already paid for itself.

* **16GB Cruze Flash drive** Another floor find!

* **Black bag of holding** No idea where it came from.

* **3DS Black** Train-ride saviour.

*Additional photos(forgot a few things at my desk)*

* [**Moleskine Journal Large, Plain**](http://www.amazon.com/Moleskine-Cahier-Journal-Large-Pebble/dp/8866134252/ref=pd_sim_14_2?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=0P8G094GW9B2X841CE8J&amp;dpID=31WwCB63kzL&amp;dpSrc=sims&amp;preST=_AC_UL160_SR160%2C160_) A great pocket notebook for when I need to make shop notes or donât need my huge sketchbook. And yes, I like subs.

* [**Pocket Ref, 4th Edition**](http://www.amazon.com/Pocket-Ref-Edition-Thomas-Glover/dp/1885071620) If you are a maker of anything, or just want to be a better person own this book. If you need to know it, there is a good chance it is in this book! Seriously, this thing is my bible.

632,"So when I was in High School and thinking about going to art college I  got a recommendation from a teacher to take some saturday classes at the College so I could see how I liked it. This was back when I wanted to be an illustrator so I naturally chose figure drawing.

The class was amazing and I had the best experience possible. Our instructors were two student teachers (who were both ~20 year old women) who studied Art Ed and had to get some teaching credits. That class was one of the best exercises I have ever done as an artist  highly recommended to any aspiring artists. 

But thats not the point of my story.

Fast forward 2 years, I am now a freshmen enrolled at said college. As part of foundation year I had to take a few drawing classes, one of which was figure drawing. So first day of class, I walk in and there is a girl I recognise from the class I took two years ago (Lets call her Sarah). We were chatting away when the teacher walked in...closely followed by one of our student teachers (who we will call Amy) wearing sweats. 

Now Sarah and I knew Amy pretty well (we had talked to her pretty extensively every weekend for 8 weeks) so Sarah and I just kind of looked at each other, because we knew full well what was about to happen, while Amy got up on the model stand and got undressed. 

Amy got into her first pose (which was a mildly sexual ballerina position) and turned her head to the right...and made direct eye contact with Sarah and I. 

You could see the look on her face shift from ""Huh, I recognise those faces"" to the realisation of ""Oh my god, I recognise those faces"" to the final identification of who we were. 

While everyone else was trying to capture her pose, the most awkward 5 minutes of our three lives were playing out in silence.

TL;DR My previous drawing teacher was the nude model in my college drawing class. Got to see her tattoo.",2015-07-26 19:11:49+00:00,ctgx7jj,2.0,t1_ctgjwx1,32888,videos
