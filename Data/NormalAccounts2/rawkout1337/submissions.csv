After using about 10% of it, the filament broke off in the clear, flexible tubing leading to the print head. I called 3DS and they sent me a replacement for free.

Got the replacement in the mail a few weeks ago, set it up today (Trying to print some ornaments, what better colour than neon green!) and everything was fine...Except my replacement also just printed 10% and now the cartridge is doing the exact same thing.

The print will attempt to run and the cartridge will make a ""click--click--click--click"" noise and I can see the filament being pushed/pulled about .5mm inside the clear tubing, it just won't extrude. 

I took the cartridge out and reverse-fed the filament to see if it had broken off, except this time I do not see anything to indicate that it has broken off in the clear tubing. I think it may be a clog in the actual extruder, but I don't feel like taking it apart. 

Also, the printer works perfectly with Black/Dark Grey PLA cartridges, its just the green that is giving me problems.

When I called CSA this morning to find out what was happening, I was informed by a third agent  that **the ticket number I was assigned was in regards to a DCMA request, there was no mention of my data usage meter or the fact that I couldn't access it, and neither of the two people I spoke to on Sunday were attached to the report.** 

Essentially, the CSA agent I spoke with two days ago lied to me and did absolutely nothing to fix my problems. 

Agent 3 created a new ticket number and is escalating the problem to the next support level. He noticed immediately that my account was missing a lot of information and that something was wrong. 

~~I will be contacted by the end of the week by a senior tech about the issue. Standing by...~~

Edit: I was contacted by the very helpful Senior tech who told me that other users are having similar meter outages so mine might be related to that and to check back in on Nov 17th.

Oh, and I reported the other agent for not doing his job. 

*Side note*  I also complained to Comcast on Twitter and Facebook and was contacted (albeit only after linking to my other two posts) by a polite, fourth CSA agent via reddit PM who offered to open a third ticket number for me. Sorry bro, I don't need another person in this pile. ",Comcast,Update II: 2 Months ago I submitted an FCC Complaint re:data caps and Comcast has since revoked my access to their Internet usage Meter.

I called in at 10:30 and was told by the automated system that they have high volumes of calls and to expect a wait. Thats fine, usually I am on hold for about 20 minutes.

No. Not even close. 

I was on hold for 45 minutes and then the call was disconnected. Frustrated, I called the Customer Support main line and was again, placed on hold. After talking to an agent (who insisted I get transferred to Internet Support and not CSA) I was transferred to another agent. They were unable to help and told me they were transferring me to CSA (like I asked in the first place)

A stunning **2 hours and 45 minutes later,** I had still not gotten through. Using a second phone I called the main Support number and (after getting transferred and put on hold for another 10 minutes) lodged a complaint. Astonishingly, 5 minutes later I got a call from CSA (who were coincidentally not busy anymore).

It gets worse. 

The first agent in CSA I got through to told me that they have been very busy today and would not acknowledge that 4 hours was an abnormal wait time and did not apologise. 

After explaining my problem (for the 5th time) he then told me that he couldn't help me and to transferred me (after another 10 minute wait) to another agent. 

This agent said he was able to re-enable my access to the Data Usage Meter, but he could not tell me why it had been revoked. The only explanation he gave me was ""It is a back end problem where we had to 'refresh the data' and I am not authorised to give that information"" and that my meter will work again in 24 hours.

When I pressed him for more information, he said (direct quote):

""Its an error where we can't release what type of error it is, but it was an error on the back end""

**So not only did they disable my access to the data meter, but they won't tell me why.**

*Next steps:*

I am having the agent send me a report (within 48 hours...yeah right) to find out when my access was revoked. If it falls near the date I filed an FCC complaint it will validate my suspicion. 

I have filed complaints with the FCC, BBB, and Comcast Corporate about being on hold for 4 hours and not getting satisfactory answers about why information about my account was changed without my permission, knowledge, or consent.

Desiree &gt; Hello $ME, Thank you for contacting Comcast Live Chat Support. My name is Desiree. Please give me one moment to review your information.

Desiree &gt; I understand that you want to know your data usage consumption, is this correct?

ME &gt; correct

ME &gt; My usage meter stopped displaying last month and has not worked since

Desiree &gt; Thanks for letting me know.

Desiree &gt; No worries!

Desiree &gt; I can certainly help you out.

Desiree &gt; Access on your end has been removed already for all customers.

Desiree &gt; I can go ahead and check it for you.

ME &gt; What do you mean by ""Access on your end has been removed already for all customers""

Desiree &gt; That means that it is already disabled for you to check the data usage on our account.

ME &gt; Why was it disabled?

Desiree &gt; Upon checking, your data usage for October is 306 GB.

ME &gt; Ok, And why was my access to that information disabled?

Desiree &gt; I would like to inform you that you have reached Internet troubleshooting support team. To resolve this, please call our CSA hot line 1-888-565-4329 during normal business hours: M-F, 9:00 am to 11:30 pm EST S-S, 10:30 am to 6:30 pm EST.

Desiree &gt; They can provide you details regarding your data usage concern.

My boss tells me that he is having an ""email emergency."" I tell him (politely) that he is shit out of luck because there is no way I am coming in that late at night and to wait until the next morning. 
 
I wake up to about 12 texts and a voicemail that are basically ""I fixed the problem"", ""the problem is back"", ""when are you coming in? Please hurry!"" Now let me be clear, this guy has an ""email emergency"" on a monthly basis, but it wasn't until I got to the text saying he would pay me a $100 bonus if I fixed the problem before noon that I took his request seriously. If he was willing to throw in an extra hundred bucks, there is probably a real problem. 

So I rush to get to the office around 9:30 and my boss is frantically typing on his computer. He tells me that he thinks client emails aren't coming through so he has been sending himself constant test emails and none of them are coming through either.

I sit down and check all of the usual suspects. Account settings were right across all his devices, the network was fine, I sent a couple of test emails and they came through fine. I asked him to send a test email to himself because I wanted to see if the server was bouncing them back for some reason. 

It was at this point I realised what the problem was. He was typing in his own email address incorrectly (which is *firstname*rentals@gmail.com). He had been sending dozens of emails with the subject line ""test"" to someone else all night/that morning. I informed him of the typo and he just kind of stood there contemplating the fact that he **literally** **spelled** **his** **own** **name** **wrong.**

Turns out he wasn't missing emails, it was just a slow email day. He gave me the $100 out of sheer embarrassment. 

TL;DR: Boss thinks he isn't getting emails, tries sending emails to himself. Doesn't get the test emails, calls me late at night repeatedly. He was typing his own email address wrong, paid me $100 to fix a typo.
