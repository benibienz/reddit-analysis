1,"&gt;voters should be smart enough to not let that happen.

sigh...

It makes perfect sense why there's so little emphasis on quality public education in the US. An uneducated populace is far easier to manipulate.

8,"When I was a teen I worked in an ice cream shop that made all its flavors in-house, including durian. It was really popular with the Vietnamese people in the neighborhood, but pretty much no one else ever bought it. When we had to make a new batch, we would literally daisychain extension cords outside and set up a table behind the building. Running a ton of durian fruit through a blender smells like gasoline and vomit. Not for everyone, but some people were all about it",2016-11-05 18:06:44+00:00,d9n3qex,2,t1_d9mtjhu,16383,AskReddit
