Most all of my shares in various funds transferred over, but I have a random ~$500 that transferred over in cash instead. I suppose there's no harm in keeping some extra cash in the core, but I'd rather have that money working for me. What would you buy if you had a random $500 to use? I'm looking for long-term value. Not looking for YOLO ideas. I'm doing my own DD but always interested in hearing other investors' perspectives.

I had tried smoking in middle school, but it was some low-grade brick weed and I was a noob, so it didn't do anything for me. In 8th grade, my folks could tell I was heading down a risky path, so they forced me to take up extracurriculars at school to keep me out of trouble. I was drug free throughout high school because I had thrown myself into the school's music and drama programs.

Come senior year, age 17/18, the pressure of college applications was over, and  I just let loose. My best friend and I got into smoking everyday. We would have marathon sessions every night and just chill, listening to records, playing guitar, being high on our sweet adolescent lives. At the time, it was like a new world was being opened to me. It helped that all our closest friends also loved smoking. ... or was it that they were our closest friends because they loved smoking? ...

Throughout college years and my 20's I continued smoking daily. It was just like coffee or food, an unquestionable given of my daily life. The routine of getting high was so ingrained into my life that I would often prioritize that above all other needs. I remember being so broke that I started selling stuff to make a few bucks and get a gram or two. And then I'd still be short on rent! And my fridge was empty! 

I'm rambling I realize, I could write a whole memoir about my life with weed. As I got into my late 20's, the blush had really come off the rose. Still smoking everyday, but more and more feeling negative, anxious, reclusive, and lazy. I had built a life conveniently around weed, since all my friends and my wife love to smoke too. 

These last couple years I really began to feel like a prisoner. I couldn't stay in shape because I was always munching. I couldn't socialize well because I was always deep within my own head. I couldn't get anything done because I was always putting it off until ""after this bowl"".

I'll be 29 this spring and it's now been just about 10 years exactly that I've been a daily smoker. My wife and I are talking about having a kid within a couple years and I'd really like to get healthy. I'd also like to get to know myself, without the constant cloud. 

 I've committed to making this the year I cut the cord. Since NYE, I've gone from smoking 5-10 bowls in a day to only taking a hit or two when my wife smokes. I can't do cold turkey, I've tried many times. Some days I don't smoke at all, but some days I still take hits. The cravings are there every day. I'm trying not to be too militant with myself, so I'm trying to wean myself down to the point that I can refuse the cravings.

This sub has been a huge inspiration along the way. It's SO nice to know I'm not alone in my quest. Thanks for letting me vent here, hopefully in time I'll be one of the dudes posting about being hundreds of days smoke free.  Best of luck to you all! 


TL; DR:  after 10 years of daily smoking, I'm trying to wean down to nothing. Not every day is smoke free but I'm way closer than ever before. Thanks!",leaves,Not every day is a success,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/41lq1c/not_every_day_is_a_success/
