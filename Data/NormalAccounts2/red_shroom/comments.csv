35,"Yea a greasy ol joint came rustling into my end of the block--but before you know, it (the mangy mutt of mine) grabbed hold of that lock-loose and wouldn't let loose if you know what I'm saying. So either way the hound (I called her Tarise) bit off a little more than she could chew--literally. So Tarise is munching away at the grimiest piece of human flesh that ever saddled a tooth when the old roughneck comes at me with a wrench for rampage number dos. I'm praying to the high heavens that Tarise will stop slobbing his steak and help a brotha out so to speak, but of course you can't throw the beast as far as you can trust it! So I hightail it out like a goose at a gander as the monkey chases me with metal in mano. To make an interesting story boring the carpenter or what-have-yew chased me up a tree without a twinkle in my eye. By now Tarise was halfway up the hill questing to quench his thirst--with a pail of water. But Jack ain't coming down from this tree, and I whistle times three. Of course Tarice can't resist the whistle of an angel and rumbles back to my rescue. The do-badder wasn't having a round 2 with my creature and he rattled out of my diamond and hit the road.

59,"Holy mofo the Nintendo Entertainment System is terrible now. The *sheep* who praise this machine, and pay **their** money, not **mine**, for each vc release, must not be trying to have fun.
What shocks **me** most, is the leap in quality, between the nes and the snes. **I** just played super metroid recently, and got more engaged than **I** have in any game in 10+ years.Because **my** taste is different, **I** am completely dumbfounded by the fact that *other* people can enjoy this casual entertainment system.
Honestly free mobile games give **me** more depth, quality and fun than 99% of nes games do (just wanted to point this out, this is what meaningful conversation is about). Nes games are literally, play for 5 minutes, and never play again titles.Literally. And if that's how **I** play them, it *proves* my opinionated points even further.
So can someone please explain to **me**... Why would anyone play a nes now? Is it weird that **I'm** better than you guys even though **I** veil this by saying **I** am not?Especially when you have so many better retro nintendo options. the snes, the gameboy, the n64... **I'm** currently playing games on all these consoles, and they are simply better than the nes. Therefore, the nes cannot be worthwhile too.
Don't get **me** wrong, **I** respect the system for what it did. **I** just can't for the life of **me** understand, why anyone would stick up for something like... excite bike these days.(Note to you peasants: **I** *hate* excite bike these days, and if **you** like it then **you** are obviously wrong..have you SEEN the snes????)Do I lack empathy? No, I am addressing NES fanboys, obviously I will seem outnumbered. If I complain when they disagree with my opinion, then they will get me. I mean **I** could understand dipping in for nostalgia... But proclaiming it's a superior machine to any generation after? Come on, *that* opinion is wrong.",2016-07-27 18:22:13+00:00,d5tanfr,9,t1_d5t8fwb,2596,nintendo

102,"There I was, like it was Friday the freakin' fifth, and I was huntin' guppies like a yuppie ol grumpy down at my cousin's ol' stream in southern Orleans. So I have my paws around this cute little Actinopterygyii and the gator must have been going for the same ol fish or something because it launches three, maybe fourteen feet at me and grabs hold of my hand or whatever. Long story shorts my mutt, my beast of sorts is going ham jam thank you ma'am while I'm crying to the only God I know for mercy or something. The gator actually lets go of my hand as the dog jumps to bite the reptilian's jaw...worst timing ever much?? Funnily enough my hand was intact but the crunch from the hound takes down tres fingas! Doggie DONT care and jumps back at the gator (gator is retreating for some reason). I yell alligator, nah, alli-later and start running to meet my cousin meat and beg, plead, and generally ask for a hospital truck of sorts. Fast forward to the l'hopital's hospital and the nurse doesnt believe a creak out of my mouth, what an insult! She claims I'm bad with a handsaw or some junk in her trunk, but I'm about to pass from bloodloss at this point. I tell her stone cold to 'save the fingers save the fingers' , 'all I have is piano it is my only passion my only dream'. She laughs and says 'you'll be fine honey'. Next thing I know im fingerless like a lonely lass, and now I'm here.",2015-11-21 19:23:49+00:00,cx887tu,5,t1_cx7ubht,36445,AskReddit
