9,"Speech for my kid didn't really take of until a few months past the two year mark. Since then it has never stopped. Different rates. Read stuff together, point things out and pronounce them. If the kid is using a pacifier there are some studies that show that they actually harm development in speech (at least in the beginning) since the pacifier kind of hinders the kid from moving their tongue around practicing sounds.

If you have a local library close to where you are at they might have some books aimed towards language development. Easy to grasp words where you practice making sounds with your mouth. There are also a few Youtube videos that are pretty fun that does the same thing.

Since God as a concept to a kid could just be as true as any other existence (Santa, Bugs Bunny etc.), I just roll with it. Some people believe it. Other's don't.

God is something people believe in. Other's don't. 

As they grow older you'll be getting into the whole impact religion has on society or cultural differences or whatever.

I teach religion and I identify myself as religious so it might be easier for me since I have a concept of God. I just make sure not to press it onto my kids until I feel that they can decide for themselves.

55,"Look up learning styles on Wikipedia. Most of the time, a 45 min intensive study session without distractions followed by a planned 10 minute break works well. 

Take notes while reading. Activate your senses by using pen and paper. Use different colors when writing and base the colors on what type of information you are writing.

Have all your notes sorted out a few days ahead and use only these notes with the occasional double check the book to develop deeper knowledge of your subject. 

Book a room in the library or other space away from home when studying. This makes it less possible for you to procrastinate. 

Listen to meditative music or video game music. At least from what I have heard, video game music is designed to be optimal for decision making or whatever. I just listen to some classical composers I have never heard of. Makes it easier to shut the music out.

Try and avoid your cellphone. Have a small buzzing alarm when your 45 minutes are up and it's time for a break. 

Plan your study sessions to last longer than two hours. Learning something takes time. Understanding it takes even longer. Everyone on Reddit can analyse everything and it's not hard. Remembering and understanding how things are related are a bit more difficult.

I have a ton of other ideas as well that I have seen my students or myself try out. These are just from the top of my head.

Oh. Stay organised. Your notes, pencils and papers should be in order.

Also. The day and the few hours before the exam. Skim your notes. You are only going to mess molecules or whatever you are learning up if you try and learn something in the last minute (if molecules are what you are studying in biology :p)

It is worth it. You have created life. You get to shape and mold a human being who will eventually be their own person and who by nature loves you unconditionally.

It'll get better. You are allowed to feel a bit strange about this. The first couple of months are difficult. Easy to say when one has done them, okay to hear when one is in them and impossible to understand if one is not a parent.

I think that whatever happens the first weeks or months or even years of parenthood is very unique but has similar aspects of it. That's why this place is golden. We talk about stuff for real. Any emotion or idea necessary to put into words here is worth giving words of advice or ideas back on.",2016-01-05 17:26:59+00:00,cymyavp,1.0,t3_3zkq7e,5392.0,daddit

130,Hahaha! Yes! A night ruined by some very difficult to predict noise scene. I hate it. At least in series when the same scene is played from different perspectives I can sense when there's a flashback and lower the volume prior to whatever will happening and then raise it again. ,2016-01-05 17:17:09+00:00,cymxwiw,4.0,t1_cyml1nh,32096.0,Showerthoughts
131,"Hey!
Congratulations.

A quick tip for the first weeks. Be aware of your emotions when you become a dad. You can do everything right and still feel like shit. That's okay. Completely okay. But if you feel that you need support, either vent here (to get people's perspective, I lived on this sub for the first 1.5 years with my 1 born) but also, make an appointment with a professional. People do it all the time.

Becoming a parent takes it toll on everything in the beginning but dude. When those first weeks or months passes and you guys start figuring out routines. That's when it becomes easier. And then what is easier becomes another type of difficult, but still easy and then strange and then just a complete maze of amazement.

Huge congratulations!",2016-01-05 08:02:22+00:00,cymkp2k,1.0,t3_3zihw9,12920.0,daddit

138,"As others have said, routine is key. With our first kid we had no routines or we made sure to never stick to one. Really lost during that time of my life honestly :)

With our second one, it has just happened that I spend my evenings carrying her around in one of those bags that you can buy when you get a stroller. I do this in our garage for 20 minutes and she's out. She then sleeps next to my wife when I've gotten my fair share of PS4.

We have always co-slept when they were smaller and made the transition to their own bed when they stopped breast-feeding during the night or was able to sleep longer periods without having to eat. I think this happened around 6 or 7 mo with our first one and I'm waiting for it to happen with our youngest one.

Still, 3 or 4 nights every week since she was able to walk, my oldest one walks into our room and goes to sleep in our bed. Benefit of co-sleeping early I suppose. I don't even notice her. But it's not for everyone.",2016-01-04 07:12:52+00:00,cylb5lt,1.0,t3_3z8u40,88880.0,daddit

If they are younger or christmas is not around the corner (duh!), I suppose preparing them a bit beforehand (a couple of weeks) by talking about it, and then perhaps do some magical thing where they get something because the magic pacifier fairy gets all happy when kids leave their loved pacifiers to her.

You could write a letter. Add pictures explaining what is going to happen. Then you have an event that you can relate to whenever it becomes something your kid wants to think about or misses in the future.

Or just quit cold turkey. I think quitting pacifiers are harder for kids than quitting smoking for a chain-smoker.",2016-01-04 07:04:02+00:00,cylb0ak,1.0,t3_3z7atm,113500.0,daddit
