I like self-posts as much as anybody because they generally make up the community aspect of this sub. During my four years here under various accounts I have provided you with 0 articles and like 50 self-posts :) However, there are a a lot of different ones. Would it be possible to get some flair thing going? Something like ""NewDad"", ""Question"", ""NeedToVent"", ""Travel"" etc. We could have a small vote based on like 7 or so suggestions?

It's not that I like to filter all of you out but often when I go here it seems a bit unstructured. It would be nice to kind of sort things out.

I found this sub through /r/daddit and quickly joined up. I live in Sweden, work as a teacher on upper secondary level and have plans on continuing to pursue a ph.D in the future within the field of pedagogy or literature.

A month ago, /u/Mongo1021 asked if we could create a FAQ on daddit. It didn't really gain momentum so here's a repost (with mandatory shoutout the original thread starter) with the same idea, only a bit different.

Instead of writing new tips and ideas (which is great), how about we search the sub for really amazingly written or interesting perspectives on common questions. Let's compile a bunch of links in this thread and then work together into sorting them out in different categories. We'll put a deadline (let's say a week), and then start sorting the posts into different categories.

Another way of doing this is voting for the best submission based on categories we have already decided. I don't know which is the best because they all sound a bit more complicated than I'd like it to be.

Hi! Missed the question mark in the first post (thanks bot!)

Long time lurker under various usernames. I frequent /r/daddit a lot because I have two kids and a marriage (A+ stuff, I'm thrilled and it's great), but the more seasoned veterans there have already answered a lot of my questions and this one does not really deal with fatherhood.

I know I can google this stuff up. But I've been redditing long enough to trust you guys rather than random websites. I'll keep it short.

I am not an anxious person. But I constantly think that my actions affect two or three people all the time, and each person in that line makes me nervous and unfocused. I seem to have a problem narrow down my actions. I can drive and almost miss a red-light and as a result, I get anxious that I hit somebody without knowing, or I start to think about all the other people who saw me and their experience. Or I can write a joke in a conversation with my friends and a few minutes later I get worried that someone was offended. I can even write this post and feel anxious or worried about it a few minutes afterwards.

People tend to see me as a very optimistic and positive guy. I am and I am not unhappy. But I feel that I have lacked positive male role models in my life, and I constantly borrow or think that I should get some characteristics of my friends in order to make me feel less anxious and more secure. It's a duality and I feel that I do not really know myself (apart from being very pragmatic I suppose.)

This is not constantly going on but happens from time to time. And it is a bit exhausting.

I am having some problems finding good memory to upgrade my family's iMac. I used to do a lot of PC hardware but this was years ago and I seem to have forgotten most of it.

The specs allowed in our iMac are, according to Apple:

Max mem allowed: 16gb

4 memory sockets (2 occupied already with 2*2gb)

PC-10600

No buffer

No parity

204

1333 DDR3 SDRAM

Could anyone point me to any memory to give me a starting point because I seem to be unable to find all of those specs within a single memory wherever I look.

Apple also says that each socket should be filled with either 2 or 4gb. I was thinking that perhaps I could buy 2*4gb now and keep the 2*2 gb already there, or will I see a big increase if I buy 4*4gb directly?

I have posted here once before. You guys are great and I love the community so here's a few thoughts I need help figuring out.

I just bought TTK. Been playing the original for about a month. I am currently level 39. I always disemble rare and uncommon items and always equip a new one as my primary if it raises my lightning experience. I rarely pay attention to what the weapons can be upgraded to and I am sure I have missed some good rare loot stuff because I figured that the weapon or armor I was using was a level 32 uncommon and the one I got was a level 30 rare. I also have no idea what my horn in the game does and I do not know if I should donate stuff to my fraction. Will it help me in the future?

Am I playing the game wrong chasing lightning? I've got like two items in my vault. I have one legendary item so far and I got it during a strike mission. It's a level 40 so I am eagerly awaiting a chance to try it out. 

Any tips on if I should change the way I go about the game. I'd love to continue the TTK storyline but I keep getting sidetracked doing vanguard missions. I am only allowed playing the 20 level strike missions as of yet. 

Should I visit the reef or other places instead of the tower if I'd like to get other bounties or by new gear?

I have read a lot and it seems as if the Remote Play works for some users with Android phones but that's about it. I was thinking more in terms of:

1) Streaming my gameplay and watch the stream on my TV using chromecast (provided they have streaming services, otherwise perhaps mirroring my phone to the chromecast)

2) Getting chromecast to stream my PS4 by magic.

Anyone tried anything of the above? Perhaps entirely unplayable?

I bought a [Philips SHB5500 Bluetooth Headset](http://www.amazon.com/Philips-SHB5500BK-27-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B00NUVS3DM) to use primarily with my smart phone while listening to Spotify. I read the instructions wrong and found out too late that it does not come with a 3.5 plug (it said 3.5 sound effects some thing), anyway. There's no 3.5 plug on it nor did it come with any other cable than a mini-usb &gt; USB in order to charge it.

Since my PS4 is unable to detect the headset as a bluetooth device (also something I read way too late), I am a bit at loss. Will I be able to transfer audio through the mini-usb from the controller to my headset (which has mini-usb on it?) 

Would a cable such as this suffice?

Recently had a 3mo and decided to buy a PS4 becuse, hey, it's like: ""Here's a treat for me when my 3mo is asleep.""

And sleep the youngest one do. Both of them actually. I don't hang out with my wife as much as I used to before we had our second, but we'll get back to doing stuff together eventually.

I need something to almost every night since my wife falls asleep with my oldest kid and I care for the youngest (who also sleeps now thanks to the 3 mo mark and a tummy which is not acting up any longer.)

I have borrowed a lot of games from my friends but their collections are running thin and I'd like to buy something for myself.

I loved Shadows of Mordor. Played it only Singleplayer. A bit too repetitive though.

I have tried Last of Us but I have ZERO patience for sneaking around and things of that nature. And it looked a bit boring in multiplayer mode.

NHL is fun but you know. It's NHL. 

I have grown tired of Battlefield. It's too competitive for me. I want to be the best and I do not have time for it (honestly, wouldn't even be close to a top scorer anyways, but it's the thrill of wanting to get there every game which stresses me out)

I tried that game where you hijack cameras and unlock doors and stuff. Some future game when you hack your way through a story line. But it was kind of as with The Last of Us. Sneaking and no action.

Long time Black Ops player but I haven't bought the third one yet. Kind of feels the way it feels with Battlefield. I might feel bummed out when I'm not ranking up quickly enough etc.

What I am looking for is a huge single player campaign, no sneaking but still some, you know... uh, nice story but with action. Or a huge multiplayer game where I do not have to feel stressed out about leveling up or anything. I don't care if it's a steep learning curve or whatever. I got time to spend on it. I just want that time to feel well invested.
