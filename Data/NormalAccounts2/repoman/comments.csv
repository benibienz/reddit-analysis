2,"Wouldn't it be great if President Trump were to invite people to follow him on sites that denounce censorship like Voat, Gab and Ello?   A mere passing mention of these sites by President Trump would panic the would-be thought police.  

Clearly much of the blame for Hillary's loss is President Trump's recognition that social media is supplanting the MSM (that she already commands), and it is now obvious that their new goal is to seize absolute control of the dialogue on social media - all too possible given that Silicon Valley is the epicenter of liberal groupthink.  

President Trump will do his best to win minds by making America great again, but the opposition will just as surely endeavor to cast dark clouds on every silver lining through both the old and new media.  We have 4 years to win the minds of millions of brainwashed Americans, and we can only do this if we and President Trump do all we can to keep the playing field level.

28,"&gt; if there is no structure in place that allows those without wealth to receive healthcare, why would those sick and poor individuals care about another person's individual freedom?

Because I assume that people are generally good and law-abiding even if they're in a bad situation.  For those who aren't, we have the right to defend ourselves.  Hopefully in most cases though, we will defend ourselves proactively by *voluntarily* supporting the less fortunate rather than hiring someone to appropriate taxes from us by force, take his cut, then pass what's left on to the less fortunate as he sees fit.  

I just want to cut out the greedy middleman between the fortunate and the needy, and I believe a wealthier nation that isn't paying middlemen (aka government) can better afford to support the needy and will do so.  Government has no heart; people do, and therefore I trust churches and humanitarian organizations far more than the state to provide for people's basic needs.

39,"So if you can have a home, food and healthcare for free, why bother going to work?  If nobody works, who will pay for your home, food and healthcare?  

My point is that nobody has a *right* to anything that requires anyone else to do something for them.  If there were only one person in Canada, would that person still have a *right* to health care?  *Rights* are something each person is born with even if he or she is the only person in the world.  What you are talking about are *services*, and these can only be obtained if another person *chooses* to provide the service.   To use government to *demand* that your neighbor provide that service (via taxes) is outright extortion.  That said, hopefully your neighbor likes you and will chip in to help fund your gall bladder surgery which thankfully would be FAR more affordable in competitive healthcare market.  

There's a reason even millionaires go to Thailand for surgery - they have some of the world's best, western-educated doctors operating in a free market that makes the cost of surgery plus travel still orders of magnitude cheaper than you can get in Canada or the USA.  Many Americans travel to Mexico for dental work for the same reason.  You want healthcare to be a ""right"" because you can't imagine paying out of pocket for a major medical expense.  The exorbitant cost of healthcare is precisely because government has conspired with the healthcare industry to limit the supply of medical services which necessarily drives up cost.  If open-heart surgery only costed $5k out of pocket, would it still be necessary to have state-funded health insurance program?  ",2016-11-10 02:48:23+00:00,d9tsrk7,9.0,t1_d9ts07g,1107.0,4chan

46,"&gt; What a sad world you live in then. Here in Canada, healthcare is a fundamental right

What would you do if all the doctors decided they don't feel like providing you that ""right"" and move to another country?

By the way, does Canada have homeless people?  Why do they not have a right to a home?  Are there hungry people?  Why don't they have a right to food?  Why are doctors' services more fundamental to their existence than food and shelter?

47,"They have to pay more because their insurance costs more to provide.  Contrary to leftist doctrine, health care is *not* a fundamental right because someone else has to *give* you health care.  

You can't just step out the door, inhale deeply and draw in a big fresh breath of God-given *healthcare*.  The only real natural *right* anyone has is the right to *exist*; it is the burden of each of us to figure out the rest.  Nobody has the *right* to forcibly extract labor from anyone else, whether that be directly from a doctor or from fellow citizens who are compelled by coercion (jail, fines, etc) to collectively pay the doctor for your treatment.  

The fundamental point of philosophical difference between the left and the right is that the left thinks people all owe their labor to each other, while the right believes the only thing people owe one another is the freedom for each person to do as he or she chooses.  I definitely support the latter, though I recognize that you have to be one heartless SOB to not give to people as well.  The important distinction to draw is that I wish to reserve the right to *choose* to whom I give: family, friends and the charities of my choosing.  

I don't want to help pay for some asshole alcoholic to get his 4th liver transplant, but Obamacare compels me to.

99,"I moved out of state years ago and only made it to one game this year:  Mother's Day.  I learned 3 things about these buncha beauties that day:  Jake is actually human, we really *are* good (even our bullpen), and we NEVER quit.  

Was I worried after being down 3-1 to the ridiculously overachieving Indians?  Hell yes I was, but I kept thinking about that game in April that showed me these guys can do *anything* they want on the diamond and the only thing that could stop them was themselves.  Every playoff series, the Cubs got better as they figured out how to beat their opponents.  These boys grew up right before our eyes in each round.  

There were so many huge moments all playoffs that I don't know yet which will still be at the top of my mind in 30 years, but I will definitely remember these three names:  Bumgarner, Kershaw &amp; Kluber.  We beat the best and now we ARE the best.  EAMUS CATULI AC0000000!!!  ",2016-11-05 16:15:43+00:00,d9mz1f6,1.0,t3_5bahmy,1937.0,CHICubs

256,"Here's the thing:  You have to separate the man from the show.  

Bear has a resume that leaves me little doubt he could survive right alongside Les just about anywhere for a month, which is Les's show.  Les could probably not do half the crazy shit Bear does though since Bear is a legit athlete whereas Les is an everyman with an incredible base of survival knowledge and skills.  

That said, I am reasonably certain Bear has enough survival knowledge and skills as well to do what Les does, but Bear's show is about adrenaline rather than actual survival which is far more mundane.  Neither of them would survive long doing the shit Bear does on his show in a real survival situation such as those Les puts himself into.  

To summarize, I think both of them have the tools and smarts to survive just about any situation, but only Les actually DOES that on his show.  Bear's show is just him showing off how much crazy shit he can do beyond the prudent survivalism.  I personally prefer Les's show since it teaches the RIGHT things to do.

277,"Butch. I got something for you.

This gold nugget I got here was first mined by your great-grandfather during the Yukon gold rush. It was smelted in a little general store in Knoxville, Tennessee. Made by the first company to ever make gold nuggets. Up till then people just carried gold in raw ore. It was bought by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge on the day he set sail for Paris. It was your great-grandfather’s war nugget and he carried it every day he was in that war. When he had done his duty, he went home to your great-grandmother, took the nugget out, put it an old coffee can, and in that can it stayed until your granddad Dane Coolidge was called upon by his country to go overseas and fight the Germans once again. This time they called it World War II. Your great-grandfather gave this nugget to your granddad for good luck. Unfortunately, Dane’s luck wasn’t as good as his old man’s. Dane was a Marine and he was killed, along with the other Marines at the battle of Wake Island. Your granddad was facing death, he knew it. None of those boys had any illusions about ever leaving that island alive. So three days before the Japanese took the island, your granddad asked a gunner on an Air Force transport name of Winocki, a man he had never met before in his life, to deliver to his infant son, who he’d never seen in the flesh, his gold nugget. Three days later, your granddad was dead. But Winocki kept his word. After the war was over, he paid a visit to your grandmother, delivering to your infant father, his dad’s gold nugget.

This nugget. This nugget was in your daddy’s pocket when he was shot down over Hanoi. He was captured, put in a Vietnamese prison camp. He knew if the gooks ever saw the nugget it’d be confiscated, taken away. The way your dad looked at it, that nugget was your birthright. He’d be damned if any slopes were gonna put their greasy yellow hands on his boy’s birthright. So he hid it in the one place he knew he could hide something. His ass. Five long years, he kept this nugget up his ass. Then he died of dysentery, he gave me the nugget. I hid this uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass two years. Then, after seven years, I was sent home to my family. And now, little man, I give the nugget to you.",2016-09-21 06:06:00+00:00,d7vp5hs,1.0,t3_53pphq,31524.0,offbeat

If Allen is not too far a dropoff from Kelce and Ware is a bellcow without Charles, maybe I take the TE hit for the RB insurance.  Losing Charles long term is a season killer but I could still skate by with Allen only projected about 2 points a week behind Kelce.  Is Kelce going to do better than his 800/5 norm?  

Moreover, do I want both Charles and Kelce since they take from each other?  Then again though, if Charles is out then Kelce's value goes up.  This sucks.",2016-09-06 23:33:36+00:00,d7c4r53,3.0,t1_d7c4dzc,563.0,fantasyfootball

544,"IM NOT SAYING SELL IT FOR FUCK'S SAKE.  All you'd have to do to own a piece of unclaimed land is fucking GO there and USE it.  Maybe you don't own a tractor and can't legitimately claim 200 acres, but you could easily claim a few acres and put in a cabin and a big garden.  That would likely meet the legal threshold of ""use"" for you to claim ownership of the land, FOR FREE.  

Sure, farmers and miners may claim larger tracts, but that's fine as long as they can show that they are actually farming or mining it.  That said, places like the Grand Canyon won't be immediately exploited by big companies since the terrain is rough and since they'd make more money keeping it pristine and making it into a private park.  In vast wilderness areas like Yellowstone, owners would by and large understand that the value of the land is its aesthetic beauty and choose to NOT develop it.  In that regard, the billionaires can be saviors by staking big claims and keeping them wilderness just as Ted Turner has done with huge tracts of land for bison to roam in Montana.

550,"Imagine we are settling on Mars.  Surely America cannot claim ownership of the *entire* planet simply because we landed there first, so what then is the threshold that constitutes ownership?  Use of the land.  This was the basis for the Homestead Act - make your claim and *live* there for 5 years to establish ownership.  That said, the Homestead Act was a government-run program which as a matter of course had many flaws (more in the links below).  

Given then that use is the foundation of ownership, how would we divide up the earth tomorrow if we pressed the reset button on all land ownership?  My guess is we'd end up not far from where we are today with respect to lands owned by private individuals who are using it as they see fit.  Claims of aboriginal rights are invalid on lands that the descendents no longer *use*.  The one major change would be the decentralization of public lands, so let's talk about that.  

There would of course be a land rush for public lands in fertile, mineral rich and/or scenic areas such as national parks, but that doesn't necessarily mean that Yellowstone would end up a giant open pit mine.  While there may be value for farming or mining, the tourism value for Yellowstone far exceeds it.  ""Use"" of those lands then might be doing just what the National Park Service did - setting up scenic viewpoints with lodges, campsites and gift shops.  Uglier areas of public land that become privatized would be put to better economic use for farming, grazing, mining, etc.  

After the reset then, most of the land east of the Mississippi would stay as is while all the national parks and BLM land established out west after the Lousiana Purchases would become a new ""frontier"" for people to settle.  Lines would be drawn and disputes would arise (some potentially bloody like we saw in Oregon), but *private* courts would be hired by the parties to settle those disputes.  

Once it all shakes out, the west would be *more* peaceful than it is today without all these rancher-vs-BLM standoffs, and the environmentalist claims of exploitation by free grazers for example would cease since grazers would be confined to their land and necessarily have to maintain it for the sake of their livelihood instead of just wandering on toward greener public pastures.  Most critically, ALL private land owners must take responsibility for any negative impact their actions have on surrounding landowners.  Gross exploitation like mountaintop removal would be prohibitively expensive given the cost to remunerate afflicted neighbors, whereas today government enables exploitation by looking the other way and manipulating the courts to downplay any damages.  Fracking would nary exist if not for government enablers (who thank their friends at Halliburton for the generous campaign contribution).

What's more, government itself is one of the absolute worst exploiters/polluters as we can plainly see with the leaking nuclear waste dump around the Hanford Site in Washington.  Government can get away with it though since they run the courts; this wouldn't be the case if all land were decentralized and *private* courts treated all landowners as equals.

598,"At this point it's a given that Frank won't ever die, Fiona won't ever meet her prince, Lip won't accept success and V &amp; Kev are inseparable.  The only question marks are Ian and Carl which coincidentally are the two with mildly interesting storylines.  Debs at this point is just serving to prove that the Gallaghers are still the most fucked up family on TV.  

I predict next year that:  
* Liam will kill Svetlana with an accidental Drano cocktail  
* Debs will have Munchausen and force Fiona to either adopt her baby or run away with Jimmy  
* Lip will prove the Riemann hypothesis after knocking up Mandy and will livecast his Nobel acceptance speech from prison  
* Carl will lead a Black Lives Matter protest that turns violent and get shot and nearly killed by his gf's dad  
* V &amp; Kev will start a daycare center to meet other parents with whom they can swing in the back room (for money)  
* Ian will become a role model for the gay community after saving a bunch of children from a burning school, but will later be photographed blowing the mayor after receiving a key to the city  
* Frank will become a mail-order reverend to try claiming a religious exemption for all drug use, but a true believer will join his flock and turn him into a born-again Christian who preaches relentlessly to his family.  This will fail after 4 episodes when a Russian he meets at Svetlana's funeral introduces him to krokodil, causing him to climb the Hancock Building (nude of course) while declaring himself the Messiah.  Firehoses will be turned on him and he will fall off but survive by landing on Sheila who came to talk him down.  
* Fiona will choose the baby over Steve but meet a charming, self-effacing widowed dad (played by John Cusack) while helping V at the daycare

622,"Mine was registered as ""fleet"" (red flag 1) when I bought it at a typical seedy-looking used car lot (red flag 2), had ~50k miles for a 2yo vehicle (red flag 3), but not a scratch on nor inside it which struck me as peculiar (red flag 4?) since rental cars take a pounding.  Test drove like a dream though - even better than a newer and lower-mileage certified used model at the dealership.   

The Autocheck report however listed the ""fleet"" owner was Wheels Inc, which a friend of mine actually used to work for so I just happened to know that they lease out *and maintain* company cars for businesses.  Thus it was probably a single salesperson's company car for a couple years until their lease term or mileage limit was reached, and that person obviously drove it gingerly (and likely did a lot of highway driving) since the brakes and original tires were still in good shape.  

Aside from wanting to brag a bit a little about finding a diamond in the rough, my point is that the paperwork only tells part of the car's story.  Knowing what to look for on the lot and listen/feel for during the test drive is important, and I heartily endorse Autocheck over Carfax since it showed me the owner history which helped dispel my concerns about it being a fleet vehicle.  I've had it for 25k miles including the mandatory pilgrimage to the Rockies, and it has run like a champ all the while!

650,"&gt;I disagree, because there isn't scarcity. Network congestion however is an issue.

You straight up contradicted yourself in two sentences.  Until congestion truly ISN'T an issue once someone invents a wireless signal as robust as fiber optics, data caps are necessary to control the consumption of bandwidth.  

Total volume of data IS scarce when networks have real-world limits to the total amount of information they can carry at any moment.  While we're far from reaching the bandwidth capacity of modern *wired* networks, cellular really does have limits.   If you want a provider to remove those limits, it's perfectly fair to expect you to pay for it.  Hopefully that extra revenue will be reinvested by the cellular providers to further broaden their capacity and assuming they do, that should yield long-term benefits for everyone vis a vis higher data caps on cellular plans.  

The barrier for cell services is real, not manufactured as is the case with many ISPs.  Letting Google or Apple spend billions to lift that barrier should be embraced, not poo-pooed simply because they get to reap the early benefits.  They earned that right by making fuckloads of money from people who enjoy their products and services!  ",2016-01-30 02:11:49+00:00,czh5gcz,9.0,t1_czh5920,413.0,technology

655,"Without knowing all the details, what Verizon is doing seems fair.  If Google or Netflix have the money to *pay* Verizon to lift data caps for their services, that's fine as long as Verizon isn't giving them better *speeds* than other providers.   Throttling some and not others is what I see as violating net neutrality, but 
lifting data caps (that customers agreed to when joining Verizon) for certain providers is a net benefit to the consumer and is fair given they're being paid to do so and not just picking winners.

Yes it promotes using those providers with deeper pockets, but it's no different from a potato chip company paying a grocery store to put their chips at the end of the aisle.  It promotes the more accessible/featured chips, but the consumer is still free to buy other chips up to their spending limit (aka data cap).  If the consumer wants unlimited Veoh or some other smaller content provider, then they need to help that small provider generate enough revenues to negotiate a similar deal with Verizon.  

The one caveat would be if Verizon sells unlimited access at varied rates to different providers, i.e. letting Netflix pay them $1/TB while smaller providers pay $1/GB.  Granted Netflix would draw in more new Verizon subscribers than Veoh however, so perhaps there could be a separate kickback/rebate to providers based upon Verizon's overall subscriber growth.

714,"Can you gather/cut wood to start a campfire?  If so, camp nearby somewhere out of the wind and if you have some wrenches in your car, remove your car's hood to use as an easy heat-reflecting lean-to shelter (insulated on the outside with pine bows).  Carry your rearview mirror for signalling and put the side mirrors and/or headlight reflectors on top of your car facing various directions.  A reflector may be able to ignite tinder if you have good sun and can find its focal point, but I wouldn't count on it - better off trying to short a thin wire on your battery to light some paper or napkins from your glove box (or birch bark), possibly soaked with a few precious few drips of gas from your fuel filter/line.  Don't try to stab through your gas tank unless you want to die.  Don't forget to have a means ready to carry the fledgling fire from your car to your campfire - gasoline burns hot and fast!  

Make sure to put an easy to spot arrow by the car pointing toward your campsite in case snow covers your tracks and your fire dies.  Cut up and burn tires during the daytime because that smoke will be easy as hell to spot.  Don't ever sleep on bare ground - pile up at least 2' of bows to lay on and put floor mats and/or seat cushions/foam on top of that for a bed, then pile a bunch more makeshift insulation on top of yourself and/or between layers of clothing and use your salvaged upholstery as a blanket to make yourself into a stuffed burrito.  Break a headlamp for glass shards to cut your upholstery if necessary.   Collect twice as much dead/dry wood as you think you need and then double that because if your fire goes out it may be game over.  Learn now on YouTube how to build a long fire and/or self-feeding fire if you actually hope to get a decent sleep.

If you can't make fire no matter what you try (fire is your #1 priority given that your car is already a shelter), stay in your car because no bush shelter will be as airtight as your car and without fire, you will want to be inside your car when hungry animals with big teeth come sniffing around.  Next morning, get back to finding a way to start a fire though since you'll need water before long and you can melt snow beside the fire in removable cupholders, ashtray or glove box (most pop right out), and you could store water in your washer solvent reservoir if you rinse it out well first.  That said, washer solvent reservoirs that were filled with water instead of the blue alcohol can harbor Legionnaire's disease, so I'd probably look elsewhere first for a safer water container - maybe a hubcap or a headlight reflector with a plastic bag inside it since who doesn't have at least one plastic bag in their car?    

Most importantly, keep your feet, head, neck and hands well-insulated.  Use your seat cushion material to make thick boots wrapped up with carpeting or floormats and secured with your shoelaces.  After you've done all this, grab your iPhone and call 911.

I think we'd be looking at maybe $800/yr for the service contract since they both charge a penny a page b/w and 5-6 for color (which we'd do maybe half a case of in a year), so to me it seems buying would be a cheaper over 3 years given that we're a fairly simple office with modest needs.   

Right now we're still using a monochrome Panny DP-4520, so anything new is a quantum leap for us.  Just looking for whatever is most likely to last another 10 years, so buying the Ricoh is probably the right way to go.

First, [follow these simple steps](http://forestry.about.com/od/silviculture/p/kill_tree_real.htm) to kill that shade tree in the backyard while leaving it standing yet barren.  Next up, find an old tube TV that still shows white noise when there's no signal; there should be at least one of those in your grandparents' basement.  Finally, wait for a stormy night and plug that TV in right at bedtime in your youngest child's room and instruct him/her to stare at the white noise all night.  Leave the closet door open *just a crack* and make sure to put some clown dolls on the windowsill.  

If you wake up in the morning and your child is missing, then yes it's definitely a Poltergeist.  At this point, you will need to contact a ~~midget~~ vertically-challenged exorcist and ask her to trade her life for your child's.  She can handle the details, but beware it could be costly.  If the Poltergeist still lingers after you retrieve your daughter, you will also need to abandon your home before it is swallowed by the earth and move to a mirror-walled condo in the Hancock Center.
