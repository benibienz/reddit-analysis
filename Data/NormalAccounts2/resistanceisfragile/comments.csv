I like walks along the beach, (no seriously, I live in the sandy paradise that is the Gong), board games, cats and sleeping. I hate Hawthorn and anybody who makes me get out of bed. 

20 years ago, I travelled from Sydney to Melbourne (on the train) three times in a month and watched us win the Grand Final. I will never forget it and I will never forget walking to Arden St and partying with a bunch of joy-filled strangers. I intend to repeat the experience this year, except the train ride, too old for that shit.
