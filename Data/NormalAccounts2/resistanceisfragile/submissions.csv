Going to the game this Friday. Don't suppose anyone knows where Cheer Squad will be located? 

Thanks!

Was actually gonna buy two because, you know, apparently the dozen I already own, aren't sufficient. 

Anyway, couldn't get past the login field... 
""Please log in with the email address (or membership number) and password allocated during club membership registration""

Yeah, I don't have information from decades ago. 

Tried countless different combos, then looked for 'forgot password' link... 

""Forgotten Password? Please contact NMFC Membership on 1300 526 427 to collect your login details.""

Call the membership department? Really? Apart from the fact it's almost 1am  - the traditional hour for impulse buying - why not your standard forgot password system? How many sales do  we lose with this archaic approach? Don't they know how lazy I mean busy I am!? Are they worried someone with access to my email will impulse buy merchandise for a team they don't support because of a 10% discount? 

This is a topic of great importance. I doubt there'll be many bigger questions for the North Melbourne Football Club this year. So obviously, I'd like your thoughts. 

Do we have a shit website? Is this an evil conspiracy to stop me buying more hats? Is my friend in danger of putting a poo and wee cap on his head if I can't login?

Checked with support - have live chat documentation confirming, so for those like me who didn't know, use your wireless where you can. 

Interesting that their website still lists it as unmetered, but I guess it's Telstra so I should have set my bar low!

***EDIT. Appears others using the app are still unmetered, so despite advice from Telstra employee that using the app from a Telstra mobile will incur data charge, in this case it seems to be a glitch in my own very special relationship with Telstra. No VPN here and data usage definitely increased after watching game on the app, but it appears the rest of yuz are fine! Sorry for the undue panic :).
