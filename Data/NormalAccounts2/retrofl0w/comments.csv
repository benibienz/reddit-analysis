The flair system is confusing in the regard that the instructions on how to request and check status of flair are completely different between /r/gamesale, /r/gameswap, and /r/mushroomkingdom. One sub says to wait a week, another sub days to wait two weeks, and all three of my messages to the mod mail for Gamesale and Gameswap in the past two weeks regarding this (and my own flair status) have gone completely ignored.

Can we get some sort of update and unification regarding the flair system and how it works so that it's uniform and accurate between the three subs? And, at the risk of opening myself up to being attacked, some kind of assurance that the mod mail is checked regularly. It makes me a little concerned that three messages in over two weeks have gone completely ignored, especially if, in the future, I have an issue with something a little more pressing (like getting scammed) than a simple flair update.",2016-10-10 05:39:45+00:00,d8ljpuk,1.0,t3_4oznax,9637102.0,GameSale

She's right, she didn't do any of this.

Instead, she:

-Cried because she burped and got a fishy aftertaste from her pre-natal vitamins

-Cried because I told her I was thinking about shaving my beard for my Halloween costume (I looked like a Marty McFly in an alternate timeline where he just stopped giving a shit)

-Cried because my nephew moved all of the couch cushions four inches to the left

-Cried when I reminded her about the time she cried when my nephew moved all of the couch cushions four inches to the left

-Cried because a little girl was offering her piggy bank for her lost puppy

-Cried because I told her that she couldn't buy a Halloween pumpkin because it was the middle of September and it would rot.

-Cried in the middle of the theater at the premiere of Django Unchained because a horse got shot (she did not cry at all of the people that died before, during, and after that scene).",2016-06-17 03:38:39+00:00,d4cle2m,1.0,t3_4odhbb,48696.0,AskReddit

Your best bet would be to either: 

A. Sell the system with all the games on it and give the eShop account to the person who buys it.

B. Unlink your NNID from the system, wipe it, and then sell it blank, keeping your eShop account in case you ever do get a 3DS or if the NX is compatible with your eShop games or something like that.

C. Sell it as is with the games and not give them your eShop info, but since the buyer won't have access to your eShop account because they don't have the password, they would effectively be locked out from purchasing anything digitally on the system, because making a new account to get access would basically mean wiping all of the games.

I was raised to believe that it's rude for you to just drop in to someone's house without asking first or letting them know. Friends, family, anyone; if you're going to come over, please make sure you call first in case we're not home or the house is a mess or we just don't feel like dealing with people. 

My wife was raised to believe that the door to your home should always be open, and to tell people to ask before visiting is seen as unwelcoming and rude. Her family stops by their mother's house (where we're currently living) on a regular basis, and stay anywhere from an hour to the entire day. The concept of calling before dropping in is completely foreign to her.

365,"I was unemployed at the time and living out of state on my own. I was looking for jobs but wasn't really making that much of an effort. I lived across the country from my mother at this point, and she would call to check up on me on a regular basis but I would usually let it go to voice mail. The phone started ringing at almost the same time that my neighbor started knocking on my door to play Playstation with him. I didn't feel like being social, so I picked up the phone to talk to my mother and then, with her on the phone, answered the door and told my neighbor I was busy.

My mother and I spoke for about ten minutes, and she told me that she was going to send my brother to my apartment to take me to the mall to fill out job applications (I didn't have a car at the time) and I begrudgingly agreed so I had an excuse to tell my neighbor that I couldn't hang with him. My brother picked me up and I filled out an application for the record store in the mall and got the job.

I met my future wife at that job about three weeks before I was going to move back home, and after a whole crazy ordeal in which we didn't speak to each other for years (a whole other story), we're now married with a beautiful son and another on the way.

397,"It's a little hard to tell at this point. The story kinda just throws you in with the amnesia trope, but the characters all seem interesting. The battle system has potential, but four missions in it seems like it can get old fast; I'm hoping that there's something that changes it up a little bit, maybe a cover system, once I get a few more battles in. Once I've gotten some serious playtime in, I'll let you know if it's something worth getting. =]",2015-06-30 03:10:35+00:00,csn5n74,2.0,t1_csn3qp2,3550.0,vita

403,"Firstly, I don't know whatthefuck Personajerk even is, and why would I if I were on this sub for the first time or even irregularly? It really sounds like you're trying to make your little niche club more famous than you actually are. Secondly, acting like an asshole just for the sake of acting like an asshole is pretty childish, and it's worse when you justify it by saying ""EVERYONE HERE DOES IT SO IT'S TOTALLY OKAY."" Either way, the elitism/internettoughguy/exclusionary bullshit is largely why I can't stand MegaTen fans, so thanks for reaffirming that for me. Have a great day! :)",2015-06-17 00:20:08+00:00,cs902mc,6.0,t1_cs8zry4,544.0,Megaten
