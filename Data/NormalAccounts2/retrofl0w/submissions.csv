After trying and failing to quit smoking multiple times for the past four years, after having a few conversations with some friends who vape and doing some research, I finally decided to jump into the pool and started vaping yesterday! I got a Sigelei Mini Book that came with a few coils, I just have a few questions in general. 

1. I don't see myself vaping heavily, yesterday I had to refill my tank once after doing about four ten minute sessions, which I guess (according to the guy at the shop) is considered light. How often should I be replacing the coil for this particular mod? Is there a benefit to getting one type of Sigelei coil over another (nickel vs. whatever else there is)? And how much should I be spending on a coil in general?

2. Is it safe/cost effective to purchase ejuice from the internet, or am I better off purchasing from local vendors? Are there any reputable ejuice vendors online that are considered to be the best of the best or like the Amazon of eJuice vendors?

3. I've read that 100% VG-based juices tend to clog up coils and are basically non-compatible with certain tanks. With my Sigelei XTank that came with my Mini Book, is that going to be an issue if I decide to go with 100% VG?

4. Do I need to buy another tank? The guy at the shop I went to basically said that if I want to switch juice, I just have to run out what I have currently and put in the one I want to switch to and just have to deal with a combination of both flavors for a little bit. Is there any other downside to this other than the flavor mixing? I don't mind the flavor thing, but if there are any other issues, I'd much rather buy a second tank than to ruin my new toy haha.

So, with Playstation Vue now available everywhere, I'm considering getting my mother-in-law out of her overpriced cable plan and getting her set up with a Mohu Leaf + PS Vue set up. 

I'm going to get her the system, but if I get a preowned one, it will have paid for itself in like three months with the money she'll be saving.

The problem is that she's not very tech savvy, and so I would like to make the process as painless of a transition as possible for her. With that said, I just have a few questions.

1. I've already resigned myself to the fact that she will instantly dislike all of this if she has to use a PS4 controller to work everything. With that said, I saw that Sony has a Universal Media Remote for PS4; has anyone used this in conjunction with Vue and can give me their impressions on it? 

2. Is there any way for the PS4 to auto-launch apps? For example, if I wanted to set it up so that turning on the Playstation immediately launches into Vue, is that possible? Or would I just have to have her put it into rest mode every time she's done instead of shutting it off completely?

3. For those of you that have already been using Vue before it became widely available, how has the service been? Have there been any major outages with the service? Is it inaccessible when Playstation Network is down for maintenance?

The customer service was pretty stellar, I emailed asking for an order status update and received an email back within about an hour. I'm used to having to wait a day or two to receive a response back when contacting a company, so the quick turnaround time for my email is much appreciated.

The material for the cover itself is super soft and comfortable and feels a lot better on my face than the normal padding. I wore it for about an hour while watching a video and didn't feel any of the chaffing that I was starting to feel with the regular foam.

Installation was pretty easy when following the video on their website; I've heard a few people have trouble with installation and I'm not too sure what they may not have been doing correctly. Basically, I made sure the VR Cover tag was on the upper left of the headset (opposite the touch pad and back button), and put the cover on like the video shows, putting the little velcro straps underneath the foam padding. 

The only downside was the fact that it made the headset a little too crowded to fit my glasses in and kind of constricted my (admittedly larger than average) nose. I tried adjusting the straps as much as I could without it hanging off my face, but at the end, I just ended up taking off my glasses. Thankfully, I can still see pretty well without my glasses even with my astigmatism, but if you can't use your Gear without glasses, you may want to consider the purchase.

Overall, pretty happy with the purchase and I'll definitely be recommending it to the people I've demoed my unit to. =]",GearVR,Received my VR Cover yesterday! Here's a mini-review.,https://www.reddit.com/r/GearVR/comments/43v13t/received_my_vr_cover_yesterday_heres_a_minireview/

She ended up ordering food from a high-end restaurant and put it in serving plates to pass it off as being something that she cooked.

Does anyone remember this?

About 12 years ago, I was diagnosed with ADHD and I was prescribed Adderall. I ended up not keeping up with my meds and stopped seeing my doctor, and never really had any issues.

However, for the past few years, I've been feeling more and more ""out of sorts,"" and reading what people have had to say on here, I strongly believe that the issues I've been having are due to my ADHD now coming into play as I get older (I just turned 29).

I scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist in the area, but reading her bio on the office's website, it says that she is ""skilled in evidence-based practice and takes a holistic approach to treatment"". My concern with this is that she's going to focus more on this holistic aspect rather than prescribe me the medication that I feel will benefit me more. 

My question is this: should I go with a different doctor now or should I just wait and see with this one? My main concerns are time (my symptoms are now affecting my job, and if not handled in a timely manner, I may stand to lose it) and money (my insurance is awful and I pay a lot out of pocket); I can't waste either of them if I'm just going to go in and be told that running and yoga and willing myself to focus will help me.

I'm sorry if I seem unfocused and a little ramble-y. 

TL;DR: will a ""holistic-based"" psychiatrist prescribe me medication or push me towards trying to cure my ADHD ""naturally""?",ADHD,"Going to a psychiatrist for the first time in twelve years to get put back on meds, but my doctor has a ""holistic approach.""
