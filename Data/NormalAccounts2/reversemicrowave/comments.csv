I'm not talking about players lagging(which is also an issue, albeit matchmaking), but I'm talking about the lag built into the netcode. Dying around a corner with a phantom shot only to see the kill cam and see a guy staring you in the face while unloading a clip into you is infuriating! This has been a huge issue since BO1, yet no developer has acknowledged it nor has given the real reason why it is so high. Is it to give newbz and bad players a chance to win a gun battle?
