I'm a bit of a mouse enthusiast, owning about 15 gaming mice from the past 2 years or so. The brands i'm familiar with are Zowie, Logitech, Razer and Steelseries. I'll put this out there, I hate the new lineup of Logitech mice. As of right now I own a G400S (old, I know), g502, g303, and a G Pro. I don't like any of them. The 502 is a spaceship, and the 303 and Pro are both way too small (I use a hybrid palm/claw, about 19cm L, 11cm W hands).

The past while i've been primarily using the Zowie EC2-A, and I loved it. The only gripe I had with it was it was a touch too small. I like the EC1-A, but it felt slightly too big.

The 403 is the perfect compromise. The buttons are amazing, the weight is amazing, the sensor is amazing, and i'm already getting used to the rubber grips on the side, and I like them. It glides beautifully on my new zowie hard(er) pad, and was great on my old qck heavy.

TLDR: If you like the ec2-a but it feels slightly small, this is the perfect mouse.

Lately i've been using more USB slots on my backup computer (i'm starting to use it in a dual twitchtv setup, which means webcam, cap cards etc). I've noticed every once in a while when I touch any USB device I get an electric shock, and can either kill the device (lost a cap card already), or just restart the device (keyboard). I think i've also killed either the microphone or my XLR to usb device. I'm scared to plug these devices in anymore, and just have the keyboard and mouse via usb right now. Again, this happens pretty frequently (the shock) when I touch any USB devices hooked up to the system.

I've got this down to probably either a faulty PSU, faulty motherboard, too much power for the PSU to handle (its a 850 watt), or a combination of these. What do you guys think is the most likely? Personally I think its an issue with the PSU since there is no issue at all when it is just the keyboard and mouse plugged in.

If it is the PSU though, i'm wondering if there could be any potential damage to the mobo at this point? I'm thinking about grabbing a new beefy psu (like 1200w or smth) and replacing it. I'd still be hesitant to test out everything in fear of blowing another device.

Any advice / tips / questions? It'd be greatly appreciated.

I'm using the Behringer q802USB mixer, and all the sound from the gaming computer is coming in fine to the mixer (as I can listen perfectly plugging the headphones into the mixer).

Issue comes in transferring the mixer audio to the streaming PC. I'm using the USB plugged into the streaming PC from the mixer, and the USB shows up as a playback device, but no audio goes through at all.

I've tried downloading just about everything from the Behringer site (drivers etc) but I can't seem to get it.
