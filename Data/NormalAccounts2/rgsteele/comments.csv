3,"&gt;What's interesting is that I took out the /r command that was suppressing the reboot, and after it completed, it didn't prompt for one.

Did you also add a /f? If not, the program would not force a restart since there is a user logged in.

I don't think there was anything wrong with your original PowerShell detection. To be clear, I think what is happening is your language pack installation is completing successfully but doesn't actually take effect until the reboot. After the client performs the installation, it runs the PowerShell script to detect whether it is installed, but because the reboot hasn't happened yet, the script reports that it isn't installed. Does that make sense?

17,"Section 145 refers specifically to a ""motor vehicle"" which, as defined in the Act, does not include bicycles.

Whether or not it is legal for a cyclist to take the lane hinges on the definition of the word ""practicable"". If you interpret it to mean ""possible"", then taking the lane is indeed illegal. However, if you take it to mean ""sensible"" or ""reasonable"", there are clearly situations where ""as close to the right as practicable"" may mean ""in the middle of the lane"" if being farther to the right would increase the chance of a collision. On that point, the law is ambiguous, but I expect the courts would lean toward the second interpretation. (Of course, IANAL, just a biased layperson, so take this all with a big grain of salt.)

On your last point, I don't believe that cyclists taking the lane is a significant cause of traffic jams. Maybe it is, though.

18,"From the [Motor Vehicle Act](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96318_05):

&gt; 183  (1) In addition to the duties imposed by this section, a person operating a cycle on a highway has the same rights and duties as a driver of a vehicle.

It does also say this:

&gt;(2) A person operating a cycle

&gt;...

&gt;(c) must [...] ride as near as practicable to the right side of the highway

Subsection (2)(c) might best be understood in the context of this passage from [Bike Sense - The British Columbia Bicycle Operator's Manual](http://vancouver.ca/files/cov/bikeSense1105.pdf), page 14:

&gt; When to take a lane

&gt;If there is no shoulder or bike lane and the curb lane is narrow (i.e. when the right wheel track of most traffic is less than a metre from the curb), cyclists may choose to take the whole lane by riding in the centre of it. This can be safer than riding near the curb, which may encourage motorists to squeeze by where there isn’t sufficient room. You should also consider taking the lane when you are travelling at the same speed as other traffic. This will keep you out of motorists’ blind spots and reduce conflicts with right-turning traffic. Be prepared for the occasional frustrated driver who is not familiar with the safe and legal operation of a bicycle.

&gt;...

&gt;It is important to know that there is currently no concrete legal definition of “as near as practicable to the right side of the highway” so the cyclist should use discretion to decide whether to take the lane or how far to the right to ride. It is often safer to ride in the manner detailed in this guide.

22,"Are you wanting to image brand new PCs, or re-image existing ones?

If you are wanting to image new PCs, you can use the ""Import Computer Information"" wizard to create the computer objects in SCCM, then add these computer objects to a collection which has your Task Sequence deployed to it as a ""Required"" deployment. [See this post on windows-noob for a guide.](https://www.windows-noob.com/forums/topic/4505-how-can-i-import-computers-into-sccm-2012-using-a-file/) It helps to have a barcode scanner to scan the barcode with the MAC address or SMBIOS ID from the box the computer came in (or the machine itself). 

This may not be quite zero touch since you will still need someone to press F12 to get the computer to PXE boot rather than boot into the installed OS. We use Lenovo gear which is often configured to PXE boot if the computer is started without a keyboard plugged in (the ""Error Boot Sequence"") which is handy. (Be aware that this may cause issues if you're using BitLocker with Legacy BIOS since the boot order change will trigger Recovery Mode.)

If you are wanting to do a zero-touch re-image of machines that are already on your network, you just need to do a Required deployment of your Task Sequence to your deployment collection and make it available to Configuration Manager Clients. (Be very careful with this, obviously.) No PXE boot required. The SCCM client will download and stage the WinPE boot image and reboot the computer into the task sequence. (This assumes you have the ""Restart in Windows PE"" step in your task sequence which is part of the default OS deployment task sequence.)

103,"Here are some downsides of deploying applications using Task Sequences that I can think of:

* If you are deploying a Task Sequence as ""Available"" to a computer (i.e. a user can initiate the install themselves through the Software Center), each user logging in to that computer will get a notification pop-up saying ""New software is available"". Unlike an Application or Program, I don't think it's possible to disable this on a per-app basis (someone correct me if I'm wrong about that!) In addition, the user will get a scary warning when they run the Task Sequence saying ""Confirm that you want to install a new operating system on this computer"".
* You can't deploy a Task Sequence to a user, only to a computer
* Keeping track of which applications you've deployed as Applications and which you've deployed as Task Sequences could get confusing.

If you have repeated bad logins to valid (or formerly valid) usernames, it could be any of the following:

* A user is no longer with the company so their account has been deleted or disabled, but they still have a mail account on their device which is trying to authenticate
* Someone is actively trying to break in or lock someone out of their account

You may need to follow up with the user and analyze the source of the attempts (e.g. doing a geoIP lookup on the IP address) to figure out which of those three possibilities is the correct one.

If it's a forgotten account from a former user and the account was just disabled in AD (and not deleted), you may be able to stop the bad logons by re-enabling the account and sending a device wipe command.

Yes, that's it in a nutshell.

However, if you are uninstalling in preparation to install the latest version, this is probably not the way to go. If you have this ""uninstall"" application deployed to one of the computers with the latest version installed, it will remove it too. 

A better approach would be to make your Flash deployment a script that runs the uninstall tool before installing the latest version. 

One other thing to mention is that I don't think it's actually possible to have more than one version of Flash player actually installed. It's more likely that you just have obsolete entries in your Add/Remove Programs. If that is the case, the PSAppDeployToolkit script fragment that /u/Wind_Freak posted may be helpful.

242,"&gt;which I have deployed as a single application with multiple deployment types all tied together with dependencies

This isn't how it's meant to work. You don't use multiple deployment types to install multiple components of one application. The only time you create multiple deployment types for an application is when you have more than one way of installing that application and you only want one to run on any given machine, e.g. when an application has separate 32-bit and 64-bit installers. See [my comment on another post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SCCM/comments/3hgnif/can_applications_install_using_multiple_steps/cu7cuq0) for more details.

For something like iTunes, where you have multiple MSIs that need to be installed, you have two choices. First, you can create a deployment type that runs a script which installs all the required MSIs. The [PowerShell App Deployment Toolkit](https://psappdeploytoolkit.codeplex.com) is very helpful with this.

The second way to do this would be to create separate Applications for each MSI, each with its own deployment type, and make one Application dependent on the others.

I find the first method is the most reliable. I've attempted to deploy iTunes and QuickTime using the second method, and what ended up happening is that when an update for iTunes came out, it broke my QuickTime deployment because iTunes installed a newer version of Apple Application Support. SCCM saw that the version of AAS that I had made QuickTime dependent on was no longer installed on my clients and tried (and failed) to re-install it. I had to go in and update everything to recognize the new version of AAS. 

On the other hand, if you just use a script and it tries to install an older version of one of the MSIs over a newer version, it just won't do anything. (In fact, it will fail with the error ""A newer version of this product is already installed"", but I think the PSADT treats this error code as a ""success"".)

As for updating iTunes, I have never had any problem with just installing the new versions of all the MSIs over top of the old versions, so I wouldn't worry about uninstalling before updating. (This definitely isn't the case for all MSIs, but Apple's seem to be solid.) Go ahead and create an uninstall for iTunes.msi itself if you want users to be able to uninstall it through the Software Center, but I'd recommend against uninstalling any of the dependencies due to the potential of breaking something else which depends on them (like QuickTime).",2015-08-26 05:52:43+00:00,cufzmth,1.0,t3_3if4mi,10129,SCCM

246,"I had another look and realized it's actually not that simple. The discovery script evaluates how much free space is available and adjusts the cache size accordingly. The remediation condition (as specified at the blog post link) just evaluates whether the cache size has been set to one of the predefined levels. So in order to move the cache size adjustment code into the remediation script, you'd have to create a discovery script that would check whether the cache size needs to be adjusted. Something like:

    #Initialize our CCM COM Objects
    $CCM = New-Object -com UIResource.UIResourceMGR
 
    #Use GetCacheInfo method to return Cache properties
    $CCMCache = $CCM.GetCacheInfo()

    #Check Free space on drive
    $Drive = Get-WMIObject -query ""Select * from Win32_LogicalDisk where DeviceID = '$CCMCacheDrive'""
 
    #Convert freespace to GB for easier check
    $FreeSpace = $Drive.FreeSpace/1GB

    If ($FreeSpace -lt 5 -and $CCMCache.TotalSize -gt 5120) {
        Write-Host (""Make the cache smaller"") }
    If ($FreeSpace -gt 10 -and $CCMCache.TotalSize -lt 40960) {
        Write-Host (""Make the cache bigger') }

Then you would set your compliance rule to run the remediation script if either of the above strings are returned from the discovery script.

I just realized that the original script also doesn't correctly deal with the case when the free space is less than 5 GB. You need to add something like:

    If ($Freespace -lt 5)
    {
    #Free space small
    $CacheSize = 1024
    }

Edit: I also just realized that the script blindly changes the cache size without checking the current size of the cache. If you have 7 gigs of free space, but the current cache size was 40960, you may not need to reduce the cache to 5120, you can get away with just reducing it to 30720. Of course, that assumes the cache was full. You could easily wind up with a situation where the cache size yo-yos back and forth between smaller and larger values as it fills up, then gets shrunk, then gets expanded again as the disk space has been freed up.",2015-08-20 23:36:34+00:00,cua2vx6,3.0,t1_cu9rswy,17566,SCCM

First, it looks like the formatting has gotten a bit mangled. You should go through and indent each line by four spaces to get Reddit to display it properly.

Second, It's not necessary to set this as a remediation script if you're using it as the discovery script. Personally, the idea that the discovery script is making a change on the client makes me a bit itchy. I would make the discovery script the `Write-Host (Get-WMIObject -namespace root\ccm\softmgmtAgent -class CacheConfig).Size` on its own, and put the rest in the remediation script.

252,"The idea with Deployment Types is that you can specify more than one way to install an application. In the ""Requirements"" tab for each Deployment Type, you specify the conditions that must be true for that Deployment Type to be able to run. A typical use case would be if you have a 32-bit and a 64-bit installer, and you want the 32-bit installer to run on machines with a 32-bit OS and the 64-bit installer on 64-bit OSes. 

The key thing to understand is that the Deployment Types are evaluated for applicability one by one according to their Priority, and once one is allowed to run, SCCM stops going through the list. So in the scenario you outline above, only Deployment Type 1 will run (assuming the requirements for it are met).

For something like you're doing, where you're installing an MSI and copying a shortcut to a folder, a batch file is just fine. Make sure to pass through any error code the installer generates. Here's a setup.cmd I created to install Photoshop Elements 12, which requires running a utility to activate the software after it's installed. 

    start ""Photoshop Elements 12 Setup"" /wait ""%~dp0setup.exe"" /UL1033 /V""SERIALNUMBER=xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx COUNTRY=39 NODESKTOPICON=1 REBOOT=ReallySuppress""

    exit /b 3010

As for the differences between Applications and Packages, the first one is that Applications allow multiple Deployment Types, which I've already covered. Second is that Applications have a ""Detection Method"". By checking for the existence of a file, registry key, etc., the Application is able to determine whether or not it is installed.

258,"&gt; When I just used msiexec /qn /norestart /i ""%~dp0install_flash_player_18_active_x.msi"" in SCCM, it hung at ""Installing"" on the client.

This won't work. You can only use `%~dp0` from within a batch script. `%~dp0` just tells the command interpreter to replace that with the path the batch script is running from. You don't need it if you are running msiexec directly. (It can be handy if whatever you're installing requires the full path to a file, but again, you can only use it from within a .bat file.)

&gt;:: Using cmd /c to prevent msiexec from returning immediately and the SCCM client potentially killing the msiexec mid-process, not sure if this is needed.

I'm not sure this will do what you expect. I've always used `start """" /wait` when running a command in a batch file that returns immediately to prevent execution from continuing until the process exits. For example:

    start """" /wait msiexec ALLUSERS=1 /qn /norestart /i ""%~dp0install_flash_player_18_active_x.msi"" /L*v ""C:\adobe.log""

&gt;The only issue now is detection failing with that product code: {B3DADA45-F0ED-48FD-946E-7E82C2229D59}

This should work (assuming that MSI code is correct), but I use a registry key detection, like so:

* Key: Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\Adobe Flash Player ActiveX
* Value: DisplayVersion
* Check the box saying ""This registry key is associated with a 32-bit application""
* Data Type: Version
* This registry setting must satisfy the following rule to indicate the presence of this application: Greater than or equal to 18.0.0.209 (or whatever version you're deploying)

Why do it this way? If something else upgrades the version of Flash Player that's installed (e.g. the automatic updater, or the installation of some other piece of software), SCCM will still detect that the application is installed. If, however, you use the MSI code, as soon as the app is upgraded by something else, SCCM will think the app isn't installed anymore and repeatedly try (and fail) to reinstall it.",2015-08-08 06:21:40+00:00,ctvp4jk,1.0,t3_3g5dww,47496,SCCM

* Create a GPO to set the MaxInternetBandwidth policy

More details here: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa363133(VS.85).aspx

As far as ensuring the content only has to be transferred once to each remote site, you have a couple options. One is enabling BranchCache as /u/houstonau suggested. 

Your other option is to deploy a Distribution Point in each branch office. Note that the Distribution Point role can be installed on a client OS, so you don't need to have a server on site (just make sure that workstation is kept turned on, obviously). You can enable scheduling and bandwidth limits for these DPs to avoid saturating their network links.

Microsoft recommends that you don't frequently modify the membership of deployed update groups as it causes a lot of policy processing overhead on the clients and SQL processing on the server. It's better to leave the monthly deployments as they are until the end of the year. Then, create your yearly group, add all the updates, deploy it, and delete the monthly groups.

However, you can use overlapping boundaries for content:

&gt;System Center 2012 Configuration Manager supports overlapping boundary configurations for content location.

&gt;When a client requests content, and the client network location belongs to multiple boundary groups, Configuration Manager sends the client a list of all distribution points that have the content.

&gt;When a client requests a server to send or receive its state migration information, and the client network location belongs to multiple boundary groups, Configuration Manager sends the client a list of all state migration points that are associated with a boundary group that includes the current network location of the client.
