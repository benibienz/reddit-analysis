This is a change from previous versions, as shown in this image I found in a TechNet post:

https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/getfile/255412

If you leave the ""Version"" field blank, it only returns entries where the actual version number is blank. It doesn't accept a wildcard either.

Everyone else is seeing this too, right? Is this just a bug, or did Microsoft make this change intentionally? I know I can go in and edit the report to take that field back out (or at least turn the query into a LIKE statement), but I guess I'd like to know what their reasoning was.

Or, from the map view, tap the blue letter ""i"" with the circle around it in the lower-right, tap ""Transit"", then explore the map. Zoom in and tap on a bus stop, then tap the pop-up to see the departure times for the buses at that stop.
