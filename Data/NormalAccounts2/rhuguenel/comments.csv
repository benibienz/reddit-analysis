35,More money. He has a wife and kids. Try explaining to your wife you're turning down a few extra million because it is a lateral move.

40,It wasn't mid season but it was so abrupt and out of nowhere. He literally said he had no interest in going to the NFL and then took the job days later without a presser or anything.

But I will say if it weren't possible I don't think there would be reports saying he is interested. ,2016-11-21 09:07:01+00:00,da9bouz,9.0,t1_da9bm7a,257.0,CFB
41,I agree it wouldn't be a big drop off either but only if they can get a huge OC hire. Coach O is a great recruiter and defensive coach. The only concerning thing is the not being able to get his team to step up in big moments. And the Florida game he had some suspect clock management also. But I would still be okay with him as the HC because how can you not love him. ,2016-11-21 09:05:23+00:00,da9bnu5,9.0,t1_da9blin,223.0,CFB

1272,"One morning last week, a plane left Los Angeles at 8:01 a.m. PDT. It was carried across the country by an extraordinary tailwind and made it all the way to Washington, D.C. by 3:02 p.m. ET. Total flight time: 4 hours and 1 minute.

Later that day, a football game between Florida State and Ole Miss kicked off at 8:06 p.m. It smacked into the sport’s ordinary headwinds—short touchdown drives, long television breaks and a longer halftime—and the fourth quarter wasn’t over until 12:10 a.m. on Tuesday. Total game time: 4 hours and 4 minutes.

It was the most absurd sign yet of the sport’s creeping bloat: You can fly across the country in the time it takes to play a regulation college-football game these days.

The average length of college football games has increased steadily since 2008. But after two years that produced the longest non-overtime games in the sport’s history, this season is on pace for yet another uptick. Through two weeks, the average game has lasted 3 hours and 26 minutes, according to Stats LLC, which is 15 minutes longer than the 1996 season, 20 minutes longer than the 2006 season and even four minutes longer than the record-breaking suffering of the 2014 and 2015 seasons.
