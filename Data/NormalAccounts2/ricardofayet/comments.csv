I've started hundreds of projects I didn't finish and it's obvious that the excitement of ""planning"" and starting and writing the first few pages is what is the most fun. But without discipline, you end up with only unfinished projects. And NaNo is about having fun, but it's also about discipline and building a strong writing habit.

Now, if your goal is to write something that's going to be ""publishable"" after NaNo, that's another story.

The good thing about hiring a publicist for that is that not only will they take care of the organizational stuff, but if you find a publicist familiar with your genre, they'll have personal relationships with higher-profile bloggers that will get your books in front of a larger audience. Then, of course, it's a question of budget. A blog tour would probably cost you more than $500 if done by a real publicist.

If you're writing in a non-fiction niche, then I think optimizing both your Amazon product page and your website landing pages for Google searches is a legitimate marketing channel to test and iterate on, as it can yield sustainable returns in the long term. 

If you're talking about Amazon SEO, then, yes, of course, and whatever you are writing about.

64,"The problem with a year-old book is that unless you make something happen to make it sell well again, Amazon is not going to give it much visibility, even with a lot of great reviews. 
Of course, the best promotional tool would be to release another book and prepare the launch with your existing reader base so that it gets into Amazon's visibility spots (hot and new releases list) again, dragging your previous book up as well. Of course that's much easier said than done.

Otherwise, I'd suggest paid advertising. You can try bookbub and the other sites like that, but if I were you I'd give Facebook ads a try. With a good Facebook page (not your profile, an actual author page to showcase your writing) and well-crafted ads linking to your book on Amazon (and measuring their effectiveness through an affiliate link), some authors have seen amazing ROIs.

If you have a lot of worldbuilding going on and are worried you won't be able to transmit everything to the reader without inaccuracies writing from a limited POV, then it's a good way to go, yeah.

Personally, as a reader, I prefer to learn the story, world, plot, etc. from the characters' perspective, but sometimes it's not possible. For example, Tolkien sets most of the worldbuilding up in The Lord of The Rings through Gandalf's dialogues with other characters, but not all of it: many paragraphs are written from an omniscient narrator perspective simply to allow the reader to comprehend future events.",2015-07-28 17:20:18+00:00,ctj6w8l,1.0,t3_3ex5ld,234.0,writing

It's hard to get a lot of people interested before the product is actually out there (unless you build a high-traffic blog before the book's launch…), so it's better to get just a few very dedicated readers.

For that, I'd say start with friends and family, but also try engaging on social media groups for fantasy, sci-fi, worldbuilding, etc. You'll certainly build a few connections that way with other fantasy authors. Then just read their books, blog/tweet about them, etc. Then, once you feel comfortable enough about it, ask them if they'd like to join your street team. 

Organizing giveaways of other authors' books is also a relatively inexpensive and effective way to build a relationship with them.
