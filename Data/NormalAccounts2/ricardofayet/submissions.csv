My personal favorites:

&gt;“NaNoWriMo should be called NaNoDraMo, National Novel Drafting Month, because that is what you are actually doing: writing the first draft of your novel. Avoid the temptation to edit or perfect your work as you go along — just get the bloody thing written!”

&gt;“First drafts are all about putting sand in the sandbox; you come back to build a castle later. The goal of NaNoWriMo should be to collect as much sand in the box as you can.""

&gt;“If you get stuck, start with dialogue and see where it takes you.”
