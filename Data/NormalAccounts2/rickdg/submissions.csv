And by ""fan"" I mean someone who started learning about computers on an IBM PS2 and decades later realized keyboards suck now :) 

I need a workhorse that doesn't make me cringe just when I start getting into the groove with my code. I usually type with the keyboard in my lap (don't need a mouse when you have vim) and I don't need to punch a lot of numbers, so a TKL seems perfect for me. However, my choices are narrowed by needing a Portuguese layout or at least a blank EU ISO. Also, I would prefer brown switches.

Top of the list so far is this one: http://www.keyboardco.com/keyboard/blank-filco-majestouch-2-tenkeyless-nkr-tactile-action-keyboard.asp

I also looked at the Das Keyboards that I can order from Amazon, but they don't have brown switches and, for the money, I might as well go Cherry I think.

WASD keyboards win the ""this is exactly what you're looking for"" award, but the key caps seem a bit cheap and I'm pretty sure the American package will get stopped by greedy customs.

This is as far as I got on my research. Perhaps you know of any other options that I might be missing? The Filco looks fine. A bit boring, as I wouldn't mind adding a bit of color since the keys are going to be blank, but it's ok.

Merges are the most pressing issue because our team has different levels of experience and we frequently need to make changes to code in the middle of some file. We've tried tools like kdiff3 or filemerge and the process is always slow and prone to errors, namely because important conflicts can be missed among small differences like empty lines or how a piece of code has been moved. 

Another less frequent problem is how to handle changes in gitignore, namely because we can mess up the syntax, an unwanted file gets committed and then we have to delete it with another commit and check to see if gitignore worked the second time.

There are close to zero resources for people who might want to learn and use your conlangs or scripts.

I understand that the focus is on sharing ideas with other conlangers and that is awesome, but maybe there is also something to gain by making your creations more public?

I'm a web dev and I realize that learning what you can do with vim does not mean you know the best way to get things done. Therefore, I'm looking for videos where people work through some web code using the full power of vim. 

I've seen several instructional videos and those are helpful, but I'm also curious to see how different web devs make vim happen for them, namely for html/css, javascript, php or python.",vim,Live coding videos?,http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/3gdwwg/live_coding_videos/

Namely, the API isolates them (ex: the IFTTT channel) and they do not have the reply feature in comments.

I understand that groups are a way for users to directly control what content they see and FB does not want none of that. Much like Youtube wants people to click on what Google recommends (instead of using subscriptions), FB wants users staring at their timeline instead of customizing what they see.

I also know that pages have problems all of their own, namely fake likes, but I don't have much experience with them. Are they a possible alternative for people with some common interest?
