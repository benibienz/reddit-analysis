199,"I'm kind of freaking out about my skin. I have a few plausible  suggestions to maybe give everyone some direction as what to may have caused this flare up. It was noticeable by Sunday afternoon.

1.) On Wednesday night-Friday morning, I stayed in a local hotel for my birthday festivities. I read that sometimes you won't have any symptoms or visible indication of bed bugs until days later. 



2.) At 5am Sunday morning I took a shower with this guy I'm seeing and while I was washing him with his body wash, I got some on myself but never washed my entire body with it because I usually only use non-scented body wash. 


3.) I have really horrible anxiety. I've read somewhere that that might cause a rash. 


What do you think? Thank you in advance!
