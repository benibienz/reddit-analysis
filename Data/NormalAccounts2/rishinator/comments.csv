0,"I have always loved cricket a lot, and people would watch sports India is good at. Cricket was also not very well followed game until India won world cup in 1983 and it coincided with time when most Indians started getting TV. 

Having said that though Cricket has become very boring, the last I saw any match was world cup 2015. 

We can never have any other team sports has the same following as cricket because our teams suck at it, and no one is going to follow India at things they lose at.

 For eg: You used to only be able to give IIT-JEE for only twice back then, with 12th and one drop, now they extended it to 3, it's still pretty low but 2 was really bad. I like how it is in medical that basically you can give anytime you want until age 25. Why so restrictive for engineering? In this country if you mess up your early twenties, or drop out of college you're fucked as compared to any other country which are much more forgiving and have provided alternate options you can go for if you're a late bloomer.

Also I've heard MBA institutions are very strict on this regarding admission, you have to have perfect score since class 5/s. But seriously I've heard they can reject you for 10th class marks which you give like 8 years before you do MBA.

78,"I already said in my comment that IIT's do not need it. They already have it because each department is virtually another building and another college within one university, same for those 100's of top university in the world. I was only talking about private colleges trying to emulate it, they'd be better off if they focus on one field, they only do multiple because they want more students = more money.

Look at top MBBS colleges, they provide great education and make good doctors because they only take 100 students and focus of all of the institution is on that one degree. ",2016-10-09 08:37:33+00:00,d8k9g0d,3.0,t1_d8k7wh9,5272.0,india
79,"The best way to make good institutions is to ditch the 'University' model for all the institutions and focus on making a good single field colleges. In the old days we used to have Universities because the knowledge, books, teachers etc. were all scarce commodities so they were all aggregated in one place which was a metropolitan city. I don't know why that needs to be right now. 

For eg: If you have 5 institutions each with only one branch then it'll increase quality more than having one university with 5 branches. It makes sense economically as well, for eg: you have one university with 5 branches with 60 students each, then one subject professor and equipments are shared by only 60 students. You rather make a single institution all of which is devoted to, like mechanical engineering and it can have a batch of 120 students then all that resource can be shared by 120 students, and then institution won't have to divide money and students in 5 parts but all of the focus can be on single aspect. 

If you had the option to study computer science in ABC university which teaches everything OR ABC institute of computer science then of course you'll think that the latter will have higher quality education as all of it is about CS only.

The big universities are already LIKE THAT only, they have whole different buildings for each department which are independent, but there is no need for small private colleges to work like universities. They should rather remodel themselves to be really good at teaching one thing rather than teaching sub-standard 8 branches of engineering. I am big fan of institues like IIIT, which just computer-science and IT and ICT-institute of chemical technology which creates much better chemical engineers, let's say as compare to NITs who just get jobs in CS/IT anyways.",2016-10-09 06:59:53+00:00,d8k7png,1.0,t3_56kz6z,4960.0,india

But if you let's say become an arsenal fan, then your manU fans would start making fun of you if you lose and will be making fun for your poor performances etc. And the only people you really can talk about your team is other Arsenal fans. So overtime this tends to make people more passionate and defensive about their club they support and group divide gets bigger.

The inscriptions on the inside are certainly not Islamic prayers like he's thinking.

What I can make out are few abbreviations like, *Ma.* *Pra.* and certainly a number *40*, which may refer to soldier or army unit number of which this armor is for. There is also an year mentioned *1911* which is readable by anyone because 1 and 9 are written pretty much same in Devanagari and English, and 1911 is the same year for which the armor was probably used at Delhi Durbar although in video he talks about the Durbar of 1903.

Of course communal violence does happen, it does happen when you have these sanghi organization like hindutva and there used to be SIMI too. But the local populace doesn't believe in scrapping and for most of the fights the reason is not religious. In your first example all it says it two communities clashed, which community and for what it doesn't say. The only one that bothers me though is that curfew over cow slaughter rumor.

Any place that has religion and communities can't be completely devoid of religious or communal violence but we are doing much better as compared to other place in India. It's very wrong to say that in MP or Bhopal we are in living in an unbalanced equilibrium where even one event can spark a full-scale riot. Bhopal have like 30% muslims, much more than national average, if riot did wanted to happen nothing police can do about it. 

Also talking about MP of 80's doesn't matter here,  there has been a massive change in how MP used to be and how it is now. I am pretty sure this thread is about now, I wasn't even born in 80's.

158,"What's great about MP is that it is one of those places which has been able to avoid all the conflicts that has plagued the surrounding states. Hindu-Muslim unity have always been good here, Bhopal was the second biggest Muslim princely state yet most people don't even think about Bhopal(MP) when they think about Muslims in India because they've mixed here very well. No major religious conflict happened here as far as I can remember. 

It also able to avoid Maoist and Naxals which plagues the states to the East of MP. 

And the best part is that we always had a major National political parties that ruled here, Congress or BJP. Not any of the shitty regional parties like in UP, Bihar, WB, or in south states. Which is why we never have any major drama, we remain the background. 

We may be one of the poorest states, but we avoid conflicts and we have been steadily developing without any setbacks, other than Gas tragedy of 1984. Which is a major tragedy indeed, but looking at the silver lining it did brought lot of money to Bhopal for reparations and the city boomed after the recovery from incident, like a smaller and somewhat corrupted version of Marshall plan for Germany.

They were merely the transporter for it and that's all. What bugs me most about this is that it actually takes focus away other Arabic achievements excluding passing information from east to west. Like making Algebra, and pioneering early chemistry, doing astronomy. And most important of all, writing and preserving lots and lots of books.

Another advice would be to try juggling smaller size balls also along with regular size ones. Doing smaller size ones increases your accuracy.

405,"I don't hate him, I really like watching him play and I am pretty sure many people who hate on him would salivate at the thought of Ronaldo deciding to join their club. However, I totally understand why fans from other clubs would hate him. He have some undesirable qualities for a team sport, a guy like him would thrive on 1v1 competitions like Tennis but in soccer this can be detrimental a bit and I have observed this when some players who have clear shot at goal passes it to Ronaldo as if they somehow owe that to him.

 I am not saying this is a bad thing, If Ronaldo truly was this good then nobody would mind passing him the ball so he can win the game but truth is he isn't perfect, passing him and relying on him doesn't win us the top games and its shows on our record against the top teams in the league. All of these however are not reasons to hate anyone really, there are tons of worst guys and things around to which you should direct your hatred towards, but to me it's believable that he would get the hate he does. Also he doesn't seem to mind that so why do you care anyways.",2016-03-26 08:41:14+00:00,d1e0jjb,1.0,t3_4c0el5,4344.0,soccer

Basically I am soccer fan and I know that wwe is fake but then I read somewhere that some guys did an experiment in like 1915 where they told a person that soccer is all fake and results are pre-set. When I read that line it really fucked up me for sometime and even though my logical mind had tons of reasons to believe its rubbish but some part of my mind kept bugging me that what if that is true! what if it is really fake and everyone is just in on it pretending its real. Sure I was able to shake it off after a while, like an hour but I couldn't believe that my mind was fucking up over it, I had to google search things like is soccer fake and stuff to calm me down and get relax my mind when there weren't any results about it.

I think everyone of us at one time believed a delusion even if our logical mind have reasons not to but it kept bugging us like a song stuck in our head.

507,"HEY THANKS, this is the best answer and what I was looking for. What you said about magnifying or zooming is essentially the key. Basically in 2-D geometry if you are increasing any attached part of a figure 2x and want to maintain its aspect ratio, then everything else have to be increased 2x as well. 

When you're increasing a length 2x, you are basically splitting all the infinitesimal *pixels* into two, and for figure to remain intact all the other lines or arcs would have to be split into two and everything else is increased in its proportion by twice as much, if it doesn't then it violates the fundamental law of Math that 1 + 1 = 2 since we're splitting all pixels into 2 and if one of the line or arc isn't increased by that proportion then some pixels haven't split or oversplit.

I have extended this to further proof that any area enclosed within those lines or cuves will increase 4 times if you split all the *line pixels* into 2, because area we measure as length times width and a single *areapixel* will first split along its length 1+1 and then along its width (1+1)*(1+1) making 4 'area pixels' .",2016-02-04 08:07:41+00:00,cznc9w9,2.0,t1_czmnzi5,42660.0,math

551,"I would try to answer it a bit seriously as an Indian. India had a VERY BIG telecommunication boom starting from the 2000's. The cellphone internet price came rocketing down because of the intense competition between various telecommunications. Unlike USA we don't have At&amp;T and Comcast owning it all. We have Idea, Airtel, Aircel, Bsnl, Vodafone, and Reliance etc. 

This cellphone boom was also accompanied by rise in social media. So to most of the Indians, introduction to Facebook was actually their first ever interaction with Internet. They didn't get any time to learn about Internet culture and the associated do's and don'ts on the Internet. That's why many Indians don't know how to use this new thing properly which is now suddenly popular, that's why they post random things and weird photoshopped pictures etc.",2015-12-28 05:00:17+00:00,cydifqa,2.0,t1_cw52ctq,6021468.0,indianpeoplefacebook

The thing is, in all those games you mentioned, no one scored, ronaldo didn't, but others also didn't..

This isn't a problem about Ronaldo being out of form but rather about team chemistry and tactics. Even if Ronaldo starts scoring some important goals that won't alone win us championship. I am not saying leave Ronaldo alone but as many others here have suggested that ronaldo's goalscoring form is just a part of the bigger problem.

576,"That is actually a good question, Ancient Indians and Persians COULD create ICE using continuous evaporation technique. Basically whenever water is evaporated from a surface it takes off some heat so repeating it could lower the temperature enough. They would also use the fact that hot water gets cold and become ice faster than water at room temperature to their advantage.

&gt; Indian Science and Technology in the 18th Century
The Process of Making Ice in the East Indies - By Sir Robert Barker published in 1775
Following is the method that was used to make ice in India as it was performed at Allahabad and Calcutta. On a large open plain, 3 or 4 excavations were made, each about 30 feet square and two deep; the bottoms of which were strewed about eight inches or a foot thick with sugar-cane, or the stems of the large Indian corn dried. Upon this bed were placed in rows, near to each other, a number of small shallow, earthen pans for containing the water intended to be frozen. These are unglazed, scarce a quarter of an inch thick, about an inch and a quarter in depth, and made of an earth so porous, that it was visible, from the exterior part of the pans, the water had penetrated the whole substance. Towards the dusk of the evening, they were filled with soft water, which had been boiled, and then left in the afore-related situation. The ice-makers attended the pits usually before the sun was above the horizon, and collected in baskets what was frozen, by pouring the whole contents of the pans into them, and thereby retaining the ice, which was daily conveyed to the grand receptacle or place of preservation, prepared generally on some high dry situation, by sinking a pit of fourteen or fifteen feet deep, lined first with straw, and then with a coarse king of blanketing, where it is beat down with rammers, till at length its own accumulated cold again freezes and forms one solid mass. The mouth of the pit is well secured from the exterior air with straw and blankets, in the manner of the lining, and a thatched roof is thrown over the whole.

&gt;Ronni have his ups and down but that doesn't mean real needs of get rid of him, he just need to learn to have a different role in the team. He is still a really great asset to the team and last clasico he was close to score twice as well and he was certainly passionate and wanted to win. I don't really have complaints about the abilities of BBC, they're all good players and we shouldn't sell them because their replacements won't be much better as far as abilities go but it's much more about how we use them. BBC always play must stop and our midfield needs to develop. Kroos has been bad this season, I have rarely seen him do some of this magical passing he did last season, I believe offloading him will be good for both, he can play as a true #8 in other team. AND WE NEED FUCKING FULLBACKS... why the fuck did they sold coentrao, I seriously don't get, yes he was injured but he was a good player and danilo hasn't performed good at all other than that one goal. Basically if any one of Marcelo or Carvajal is injured we are fucked.. we need good solid replacements.

&gt;I believe our issues can be all fixed without firing anyone.. and by start benching kroos and one of BBC. People need to understand that by benching, the team isn't insinuating that they are bad players, it's not their skills that are in question but sometimes you just need more player with midfielding abilities in the pitch.

I hope Benitez have a solid plan, If we can dominate in midfield we should be able to win/draw. Also I hope no more injuries, this game really isn't that much important as the Celta one.

That's why they use laser in the first place, the operation is NOT DONE BY LASER. It's done manually using surgical machines, the laser is only there so that your eyes are fixed on one spot which will make it easier for the operation.

Don't get too afraid though, however I still want you to know all this because I don't want you to get a shock right there on operation table if you find things are worse than they told you. So trust me, all that reassurance they'll give you like you'll feel nothing and it'll only take small time, Take that with a grain of salt. It's much easier to get through it if you know you'll have to suffer a bit rather than going in all relaxed and suddenly have your eyes clamped which will hurt a bit. Don't worry it's not that bad, the pain intensity is not high at all, but it will be there, especially of the clamps they'll use to keep your eyelids open throughout the operation.

Good thing is they only do one eye at a time, so you only have to suffer in one eye and not in both at the same time.

778,"I understand how you feel, I used to do in online games when I'd play 1v1. After 2 defeats I just didn't had the emotional stability to play 3rd game whereas I would see more veteran players can go on playing for long even if they lose.

I will say like everything this comes with practice. With every sport there are three phases, first is noob phase where you don't really care if you lose because you know that you know nothing. Then this second phase is where you work your ass off and think you're ready but you're not and you lose over and over again. This one is the dangerous phase and can make or break a player, those who get through it reaches the 3rd phase and become great at whatever game they are in. 

You didn't mention what kind of sport it is, if it's a team sport then it's easier to deal with because you have support of whole team and you didn't lost ""alone"" 1v1 sports can be very very difficult. To be great at Chess and Tennis requires incredible amount of mental strength and mental stamina. To be great at Boxing you literally have to be a warrior, it's not just a metaphor at that point. You have to completely change your psyche to be able to stay motivated and strong and keep fear away.

 It becomes easier after you've played a LOT of games because that feeling of losing becomes familiar to you and you know how to deal with it. You'll feel sad when you've lost your 10th game but when you've lost your 354th game you will be sad yes but you'll shrug it off after a while and will learn from it. The sadness never really goes away but you learn to deal with it much better. 

Some of the tips I can give you are

* Start next game immediately if possible, then you'll focus on your game rather than last one. It's possible in chess among friends but not let's say in pro soccer where next match is week away and you've time to sulk.

* Be friendly with your opponent, try to have a good talk with them and see that they're a human just like you with your insecurities and fears. Losing to a good friend someone you know well doesn't hurt as bad as losing to a stranger.

* If you doesn't play enough times then the games you play makes you much anxious. Like if you only play one game in a week then it puts a lot of pressure on you to perform good, so try to play whatever you play as many times as you possibly can but don't skip practicing and analyzing your last games.

* Be honest with yourself and don't try to hide your emotions after your loss. It's okay to cry. People would rather prefer someone who gets sad and cry rather than someone angry after a loss throwing a hissy fit",2015-10-11 09:07:39+00:00,cvvnwcm,1.0,t3_3ob9rq,1654.0,explainlikeimfive

885,"There were some comments about Syrian women being better looking and hotter than here and we should bring them here to improve ""gene pool"" those comments are now deleted by Mods for some reason, but I have something to say about that.


We have more than enough gene variation in India from north to south, we have 17% of all the people in the world. We have 500 million girls, even if 10% of them you'll put as beautiful, then we will still have more beauty than all of Syria and neighboring regions. Most Indians look bad not because they are ugly but because they do not properly care for themselves or invest time in grooming etc. Rarely do Indian girls put on good makeup when they go outside and dress well unless they're on a party. Indian lifestyle is dull for now. Just look at NRI girls, they are the same Indian girls but most of them look so attractive because they work on themselves when they're abroad because of lifestyle change. As India will get richer the people of India will start looking more beautiful as well as they will wanna work on themselves. Being attractive is NOT because of GENES or something that you're born with, being attractive is an acquirable trait which any person can get if they work on themselves, be confident and try different styles, clothing etc. which many Indians do not bother with and simplistic lifestyle is encouraged among Indian girls.

My opinion is it's almost impossible to learn so many trait about a person in such a small visits, unless you're Sherlock Holmes - The master of deduction. He will talk sweetly to you of course, they all would. So try to focus on little silent things he do for you, like how he receives you from your home etc. I recently went to a marriage of my friend whom husband I have never met before but I knew he was a great guy by observing things outside of communication. For example despite being the groom and center of party he waited for me outside of hotel to receive me and personally escorted me to room. His friends were great, though I doubt you'll get to meet his friends but if you could, it will be a great way to learn about him. 

In the end I will just say that just relax.. Don't be over observant of things. You will just know somehow when you'll see the right man.

They send from Chinapost for free but if you want faster delivery you can actually get them to use courier service of your choice for extra money, but often that money is even more than product cost so I let them use china post.

It was pretty good quality, the cloth material was really good and very different from last year's jersey which was smooth and this was rough and softer, It indeed looked like the real thing. I like the respect badge so I made them put it on la-liga jersey for an extra dollar.
