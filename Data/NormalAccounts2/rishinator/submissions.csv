When I was in school and I first learned about Bangladesh and saw it on the map. I believed that's got to our best friend, It's enclosed over 80% by India(rest by sea and Myanmar) and it actually used to be India at one point. We had similar enemy Pakistan. 

But it is not the case.

Yet we have made Nepal our best friend and have made the world's largest fence border with Bangladesh. It's great to have Nepal as a best friend but Bangladesh would have been immense due to its economy and human capital. India is worried about refugees but had India worked with them from the start and help improve their infrastructure then their people wouldn't have need to come to India in the first place. I have always thought it was mistake but I am more frustrated about past mistakes now because of increasing Islamic Fundamentalism. I am hearing the news about Bangladesh to scrap away the Islamic nature and make itself a secular nation and I really really hope it'll succeed, even though it will be hard. 

Can any of you who knows more about the issue discuss what went wrong? May be recommend a book on this matter.

I am an aspiring marathoner-tourist and want to run around the world. I have muscles now but I am not that big. I have good torso but not much muscles on my arms. I go to gym and lift weights 6 days a week, one part one day. But since getting bulkier will not help my running I have decided to stop it, but I don't plan on quitting upper-body workout. I know some of the elite runners who seek to win have very less upper body muscles but I don't want to reduce my size. I am not a tall guy, I am 5'6 and weight 65kg (131lbs) so I need relatively little muscles to make myself look average with good upper body and not skinny.

I have decided that from now on, I will go to gym only 3 days a week so I can get more time to run and will do just bodyweight workout, no weights. So that I can be fit in upper body but without adding significant muscle mass, I know bodyweight can add muscle mass as well and in fact I owe most of my pecs to pushups and not benchpressing but it mostly adds lean muscle mass.

Have any of you ever had to go through this similar switch? What was it like.
