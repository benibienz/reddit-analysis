13. You judge people by the tea they drink and vigorously argue that you’re not a tea snob. And if they don’t drink tea at all, well, you just don’t know how to feel about them.

14. You know what bergamot is, and you know which of your teas it’s in.

17. People worry when you say no to tea. You must be sick.  Or you might have been replaced by an alien clone.  Regardless, it’s worrying.

22. You plan trips to tea growing countries to see tea gardens, but nobody else wants to come with you.

29. You spend a lot of time on internet forums like Reddit/r/Tea.

Feel Free to add to the list.

My answer is never a specific tea based on its technical specs like antioxidants etc.
My answer is simple - ""Drink a tea that you like and will drink every day because it tastes great.""
My point is why offer something like Matcha if they are not going to drink it regularly or drink it like some sort of punishment (like cod liver oil. good for you tastes horrible.)
I believe tea should be enjoyed for taste and if it helps, then all the better. That's my philosophy.",tea,I get asked this all the time.,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/3tbtnc/i_get_asked_this_all_the_time/
