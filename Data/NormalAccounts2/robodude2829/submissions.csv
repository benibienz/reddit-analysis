I have had a 928, 920 and currently the 640. I've gotten my mom, dad, and one sister into the Windows Phone world as well. I've waited for the 950, and will probably end up getting it eventually, but I have questions about android. 

I use to have a Galaxy S2. I rooted it, installed who know how many ROMs on it, and generally hacked around with it. Did the same with android tablets I've had. The one problem with the phone was that it would consistently get really slow, and I'd have to do a reset to make it work well again. That was a large reason for why I switched to windows phone, I got sick of dealing with android. 

With Windows 10 for mobile, I'm seeing tons of stability issues as well as loading screens. The things I wanted to get away from on android. So I'm curious, does android still suck after using your phone for a couple months, or has that issue been fixed? I ask here instead of an android subreddit because I see people that switch back to android, and I'd Iike to hear what the general thoughts are from a Windows Phone enthusiasts side.",windowsphone,Does Android still suck?,https://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/3z2fcw/does_android_still_suck/
