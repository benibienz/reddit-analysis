4,"Yes! I didn't start until I was 30. I grew up in the city and my folks were always like ""nooo, you don't want to kill bambi"". They weren't hunters, or people who enjoyed the country. No one in my family hunted or did anything really ""outdoorsy"". I felt this lifestyle calling to me, like a siren's song. So after some time, I was able to buy a plot of land in the country (which I live off of). 

I had to teach myself how to shoot assorted firearms and figure out how to work a bow (draw weight, arrow spine, arrow weight, etc). In the course of 6 solid months I spent at least an hour practicing every day. I already knew deer anatomy quite well, and was well aware of the vital zones and how to field dress and butcher. So I took the hunter's ed course online and tada.

As far as learning how to hunt a specific animal, it was a lot of watching and observing their language and behavior when it wasn't time to hunt, which is easy to do when you own your hunting land. Some of the animals I give nicknames too because you start to recognize who's who after a while.

I wouldn't say it was hard being late to the game, and it's certainly better late than never in my case. Would have been cool to have that family ""bonding"" time hunting I see so much of, but that's how it was. ",2016-11-17 03:30:31+00:00,da3qojn,1,t3_5ddlfh,1091,Hunting

36,"Let me put some clarity on this as I used to live in that area. CA is very interesting, and highly regulated for building anything. To build a house, you need blueprints, and approved registered blueprints which are VERY costly. If you ever bought a metal building and saw some come with ""approved blue prints"", the more expensive ones, it is for regulations like CA mandates. Add to that, there are more codes in CA. So you can get a cool plot on Oakland Hills, but you can't throw up any structure, or a yert now (you used to be able to get away with it in Santa Cruz, but not anymore). 

So for $130k, they provide blueprints, put it together and it's a hassle-free time saving solution to that lot you bought in the Oakland Hills. OR, want an in-law unit/guest house on your ""large"" 7500 square foot lot size, there you go.

58,"Grocery shopping in the USA is a bit different (and really, each location is different too as there is quite the range of diversity here). 

First of all, there are the carts (you guys call them a trolley). In America, you grab a cart when you go in. Some places the carts are outside, others, the carts are inside. But you grab a cart nevertheless. You do not usually pay for them. To return them, most places install [these things](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7027/6588772079_71f6e1e884.jpg), in the parking lot and an employee brings them back in with this strange machine contraption that keeps all the carts together. However, America being the way it is, most people are too lazy to be able to do that, or they have many small children they JUST finished strapping in the car seat, or some other reason. Instead of the chutes, the carts form [roving packs](http://i7ihxhmvf855rr1qui4ol2j.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/walmart-shopping-carts.jpg) in the parking lot. Many people have vehicles hit by the carts and no one is liable since you are entering onto private property and park at your own risk. 

Then there is the whole ""be happy with what's in front of you"" thing. Americans hate being told what to be happy with, pursuit of happiness was penned in the Declaration of Independence, so ""settling"" for something unsettles the nerves of most people. Combine this with the abundance of advertising America is known for and you have apple sections with about 30 different kinds of apples, giant displays of people talking about chips (crisps) with what dip goes best with them and where to find it in the store. The idea is to get you in and KEEP you in, so you keep shopping. Heck, the fancy grocery stores have bars in them. Whole Foods corporate store in Austin, Texas has glasses with employees standing at kegs, ready to pour you a brew and people walk around drinking beer and live music plays there on the weekend. It's an amazing place to people watch. 

Then you have stores in my neck of the woods which are old-timey country stores. It's similar motto to ""be happy with what's in front of you"", except there's the cartmagedon in the parking lot. Unlike stores in the UK, at my local store, they bag your groceries and a 80+ year old guy who got hired on by the original owner loads the stuff from the cart into your car for you. I feel like I should be helping him, but he wants a job and is very happy for his job. 

BAGS: In the USA, usually, stores give you bags. Paper or plastic. They blow around in the wind outside when littered on the ground and are called ""the urban tumbleweed"". This is usually included in the retail overhead of the grocery store. Some municipalities have started banning bags in the name of the environment, and you must bring your own bag, BYOB. The price for goods remain the same and the store profits a bit more. This upsets most Americans, as now, we must do MORE work and the store profits off of it. So when people see a discount store, they have yet to understand the price is cheap because of the lack of overhead, in their minds the store still profits off of them having to bag stuff.

Best thing for a dog, stress wise for going cross-country is to go with them in the car. My dogs loved each trip (but they loved going on long trips with me).  I shipped off my stuff ahead of time via Yellow Freight (pick up at the facility with a U-haul Truck). Total cost for the freight was like $900 for a cross-country move. This made me free to drive my car with a suitcase in the trunk. The other option was renting a U-Haul/Budget box truck and towing my car. With the fuel differences between the two, it wound up cheaper for me to ship with Yellow and drive with the animals.

The bully boy is a very social dog that loves being in your lap. He gets along great with other animals, though tends to obsess when he sees a new animal. Example if a lizard is scurrying around and hides, he'll try to find it. You can tell him leave it, which he wil, for about 2 minutes tops before he's back over there looking for the lizard. He never kills anything (he has even caught squirrels and just nose bumps them) and he's great with my birds. 

The puppy is a bit too early to tell personality wise. He still doesn't really know his name yet. He does like to try and herd my guinea birds, though, with sheep he's still a bit scared of their size. He hasn't show any interest in being a guardian type dog yet. He walks very well on leash though. If he chews on something he is not suppose to or he jumps up as you're trying to put the water dish down, spilling water everywhere and you scold him for it, he will sulk. I wanted a dog which was a molosser type to help out with being a a stock dog, best friend.

68,"For me it's a combination of several things (I hunt rabbit, deer and feral hogs):

1) learning to track game. I like to move around sometimes, and others, I sit and wait. I do it in a stand, or out in the open. Both have pros and cons, and I like to switch it up.

2) lying or sitting still as can be out in the open and a squirrel or a fawn walks in front of you unknowing is a pretty cool feeling.

3) you spend a while sighting in your weapon (I do archery and firearm), learning how to operate it and be proficient at it takes time.

4) It all comes to fruition for those 2-15 minutes when you see your game of choice, a big buck, sow or doe come in to view, and then INTO YOUR RANGE. Your heart races and you swear, your prey can hear your heart beat. You try to do some breathing incantation to calm your adrenaline down a bit so you can take an accurate shot. You take the shot and if you get the game, VICTORY!! I get so happy I do a dance and am on cloud nine for days.

5) People come to my place expecting to eat wild game and they ask ""is this one you got?"" and I can smile and say yes. I can tell them this is organic meat, this deer ate all the peaches off my prized peach tree before they were ripe. I looked this animal in the eye. It was a quick death, it died humanely and I used as much meat and bone as I could (stock) and tanned the hide. Coyotes and vultures got the rest, nothing went to waste.
