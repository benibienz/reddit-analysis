Pretty much I work for UP and got furloughed a few weeks ago and currently in FG status on a separate board, I worked there since last August and pretty much worked nonstop since then except the bump board here and there.  

My question is am I eligible, how do you apply, how much would I be getting? I am currently looking for another job since it looks like it will be a while is it worth it to even figure out or just wait for a new job?

I appreciate any help or clarification or even a link to a simplified site that explains it and has contact info.  Thanks",Train_Service,Railroad unemployment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Train_Service/comments/3l4gg6/railroad_unemployment/
