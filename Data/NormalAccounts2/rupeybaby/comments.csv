63,"It's just a lot of people's preferred vice. Losing sobriety is ubiquitous to humanity (though clearly some people abstain in the name of responsibility). Many people enjoy weed on the regular more than a binge or two of alcohol each week. And in fact get so used to it that they have at least a little buzz all the time. With this drought people are going weeks without which has a few consequences for the habitual smoker:
- Dreams become crazy intense. After smoking awhile your dream level is roughly normal, go cold and they hit you with a vengeance. This can be exhausting and confusing.
- Appetite is overstimulated. Weed is actually an appetite suppressor with habitual use and many people find a good balance in their diet on it. No weed, less appetite control.
- And worst of all, without weed people turn to other drugs to buzz. As I said earlier we all enjoy a buzz, but with weed out of the picture for awhile you have a lot of potheads dropping acid (which is fine if you are careful and responsible) and taking harder drugs (haven't much experience there). Of course many people just drink more, something they might not even be very conscious of actually.
So no it isn't addictive but it does become habitual and therefore isn't nice for smokers to have to go without. Coupled with a universal propensity to take drugs then restricting a big favourite, and one that causes very few issues by itself, then you'll probably get some issues.",2016-03-16 20:20:51+00:00,d12ei9q,4,t1_d12d85u,1648,newzealand

70,"I feel the opposite. I (big drinker, less so when pot is available) look at friends and family and how they approach alcohol (many very functional but, by definition, probably alcoholic) and then hear them talk about pot as a scourge and a life destroyer. With alcohol the hangover sucks, people can get belligerent and aggressive, and it gives no respite from the pain of life - break ups, physical ailments, existential crises and what have you - because it is a depressant with no euphoric properties. My brother recently joked that when his flat got a still his grades plummeted at university. When I became a habitual smoker my grades took no such hit. These are fair comparisons to make. Though only anecdotal they are powerful and definitely add to the idea that the government lied to us. ""If you say pot is worse than alcohol, by making pot illegal, then why have I seen alcohol destroy lives but not weed?"" That's the lie.
Not only that but alcoholic is the opposite of creative, it makes you dumb. While pot (at least to me) helps with creativity very much. To a point of course, if you slam too many js then it detriments.
The alcohol argument SHOULD be brought up every time because it relates to everybody's experience. If you think alcohol is fine and manageable and that people should be allowed freedom in its consumption (which of course I, and majority NZ do) then it stands to reason that you would have a similar attitude towards weed. And the argument will keep coming up because there has yet to be a good reasoned argument to the contrary.
If you have such an argument I am all ears (eyes?) because like a good scientist I keep an open mind and am always ready to admit when I was wrong.",2016-03-13 21:55:11+00:00,d0ymwvc,4,t1_d0ykoqb,3562,newzealand

Then also bear in mind how little farmers like government putting their sticky fingers into the daily business of farmers, read how unpopular a govt will become if they increase health and safety scrutiny, and how the perception in farming communities (I would have said except dairy but that is not the case anymore) of how close to the red line these farms are running (huge debts, uncertain income). Bear all this in mind and it is not difficult to see why govt would be disinclined to up the safety standards on farms. Maybe they are treated like a different ""class"" but that would be like saying old folk are a different class in that they have their own specific wants that politicians who want their vote cater to. It is just political realism I am spouting here, and I don't necessarily believe it is ""right"".

You may also be right that she should have gotten out of the car when asked. Maybe she would have only been warned. She perhaps acted insensibly, in a way, and it turned out badly for her. But that doesn't make it right. He physically assaulted her by grabbing her because she was not ""yer"" under arrest. He was the aggressor, despite her minor outburst over her agitation.
Think of it like this. If I am mugged, ""give me your money"", and the guy had a knife or gun I'd be ill-advised to refuse him. But if I did refuse, and I got hurt, was it my fault? Or was I trying not to let a thug get away with thuggery? Because that's kinda how I interpreted the episode I just watched.
Unfortunately Bernie is a politician, and politicians have to make political moves, and some will come off as insincere. You may think this is insincere. I don't. He is a life long activist and is trying to draw attention to that fact because that is his platform for POTUS. Even if he is insincere, I believe exposing this is important, and by attaching himself to the issue Bernie is promising to try and do something about it.
He is extending the promises you've heard and liked (by your having been a voter) to a wider audience with this posting.
He's a politician, but there ain't none better. I hope you re-realise that. Good luck.",2015-07-22 11:36:27+00:00,ctbzjn4,4,t1_ctbye3j,4251,SandersForPresident

187,"http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/vol2/treaties/apa0598.htm#mn11

This is the treaty of 1855 found with a simple Google search. Article nine pertains to territory, and although gives a promise that is clearly not being kept:
""...the government of the United States shall at its earliest convenience designate, settle, and adjust their territorial boundaries, and pass and execute in their territory such laws as may be deemed conducive to the prosperity and happiness of said Indians.""
Now I'm no legal scholar, and that is a very difficult promise to even define let alone uphold, but can you tell me that is a promise kept to the Apache in any natural reading of the treaty?
Most tribes got treaties, and they were all not honoured. Sure you can blame the indigenous people for being weak if you want, but then you'll simply be glorifying dishonesty and violent power.
