If you go back even 20 years think of who the media and majority of people would categorize as people whom ""we know"" are ignorant and don't need to be heard.

One of the pillars of this country is freedom of speech and the fact that anyone can say anything.  Everyone has a voice, and if you don't like what is being said than the correct response is to provide counter arguments and facts that back up your position.  If the person really is wrong and you refute them that's great.  If they have valid ideas that you still disagree with that's fine, but it's important to still let the ideas flow!

Let me share a quote from President Obama that I really like:

&gt;If you disagree with somebody, bring them in and ask them tough questions. Hold their feet to the fire. Make them defend their positions. If somebody's got a bad or defensive idea, prove it wrong. Engage it. Debate it. Stand up for what you believe in. Don't be scared to take somebody on. Don't feel like you've got to shut your ears off because you're too fragile and somebody might offend your sensibilities.

&gt;Go at them if they're not making any sense. use your logic and reason and words and by doing so you'll strengthen your own position, and you'll hone your arguments. And maybe you'll learn something and realize you don't know everything. Maybe you'll have a new understanding not only of what your opponent believes but what you believe. Either way you win. And more importantly, our democracy wins.

Most of the comments that have gotten under my skin are when I see people saying that ""Trump brags about grabbing women by the pussy"".  I think I might be guilty of associating that misleading statement with more valid complaints about what he said. 

I ended up listening to the clip again based on what you're saying and 100% don't like the way he talks about women in the clip. Here's what I ""hear"" in the tape when I listen:
He told Bush that he failed when he tried to make a move on a married woman (cheating, yuk). He took her furniture shopping and didn't end up woo-ing her. Made some derogatory comments about her that are gross. He sees an attractive woman and eats some tic tacs, I presume because he doesn't want her to have a negative impression of his breath smelling and makes a joke about ""In case I kiss her"". Automatically attracted to beautiful women - guy talk. ""I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet.Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star they let you do it."" This is the worst part I think. I think it's fair to assume he means ""I don't even wait [for permission?]"" but he doesn't actually say that, he could mean he doesn't wait to get home or to be in private.  He also says that they ""let you do it [kiss them?]"" He's not saying he forces it if/when someone says no. In fact, he opened this tape up with saying how he ""failed"" to move in on the married woman. Then the next section is the ""You can do anything, [BUSH: Whatever you want?] Grab them by the pussy [BUSH:Laugh]. You can do anything."".  Hyperbole, crude, inappropriate joke used to emphasize his point that as a star women let you do anything. Next, a few cat calls - pervy but guy talk. He then gets off the bus and *doesn't* automatically start kissing the attractive woman. Bush awkwardly proposes a hug for Donald and they hug/he kisses her on the cheek -- a ""family feud"" style interaction.

The bottom line is that I don't approve of that conduct and it's not something I'd like to hear out of a 59 year old man let alone a presidential nominee.  However, I think it's also really damaging to people's/the media's credibility to spin or exaggerate things at a time where the public trust of the media is already really damaged. I just wish that the media and Reddit would focus more on spreading information and letting people form their own opinions instead of twisting things and shaping perceptions.

Personally I really enjoy the game as it is -- and the team is constantly working to improve things and add more ""content"" from the kickstarter.

3) They should take that video down if it misrepresents the product. Not that it makes it better, but it's not like Hex Ent. is unique in this regard: I have noticed other games taking the same lazy approach to their steam video (No Man's Sky for example has the trailer with ""planned"" features said as if they're in the game).

4)Hex is free to play. Companies exist to make money. It's more *convenient* to pay if you want to ""jump right in"" to competitive constructed.  However, especially with the introduction of ladder -- there are ways to build your collection completely free to play if that's for you -- albeit slowly.

5) I think the rewards are actually pretty good.  The draft payouts are 5-3-2-2. That is the same number of packs awarded by magic in their drafts.  This weekend there is a free-to-enter constructed event with $5000 in prizes.  What more do you want?

None of these are things that I am personally hung up on.  To me the ""worst"" thing you listed is the video on the steam store that poorly represents the game.  If the issues really bother you, then it's absolutely your right to ""move on"" as you suggest.",2016-09-26 20:03:00+00:00,d833fiy,1.0,t3_54mh7p,1252.0,hextcg

80,"Thanks for posting this, I felt like I was going crazy and it's really hard to find relevant discussion on an older book like EOTW.

I just started reading this series and love it so far, but when I got to the part where Nynaeve and Lan start talking about marriage it was a total shock.

My understanding, up to that point, of their relationship was Nynaeve was basically having a one-sided competition with Lan.  Where he didn't really know or care that she was trying to sneak/track/cover things better than he did. It made sense given her age and home-grown pride that she would want to prove to herself that she was as good or better than a ""professional"" just for the satisfaction and being able to prove that she didn't *need* the Aes Sedai and her Warder to make do.

I don't necessarily like some of the other interpretations (although they may be correct) that make it seem like she was trying to *impress* Lan rather than *beat* him.  I think it makes her character a bit weaker if she's stuck on that.  She already surprised/impressed him by tracking them initially and catching up, from that point she doesn't really need to impress him anymore.

He finds her horse later in the book after she was (internally) sure that he'd need to come back and ask for her help...I don't get the impression that Lan was even aware that she was ""showing off"".  By casually finding her horse, I think that established that Lan is still the master. Additionally, that he found it does injure her pride. I see the rest of their interactions as her trying to gain that back...not to impress/flirt with or woo Lan as others have suggested.",2016-08-12 18:34:21+00:00,d6evxhf,1.0,t3_4mkmdo,5947031.0,WoT

94,"I agree that it's not a great idea to make a spider ""hybrid"" deck -- that's why I didn't put cards like Vilefang, skitter, lunacy, or splinter in this version of the deck -- but the ""spider"" cards in this deck are good by themselves, with the upside of sometimes giving you free spiders.

There is no doubt that the spider deck is strong in this pool, but I also feel like it would have a hard time against a random deck that just curves out 2-3-4 or 2-3-2+2 -- none of the early creatures are that good at blocking (aside from vilefang, which is great) and a spider deck usually needs some time to get going.

Cards like lunacy, splinter, and even skitter are going to be dead draws unless their deck is already pretty full of spiders, and even then you're relying on good RNG to get a card's worth of value.

My goal was to strip the slow/mill/RNG heavy cards out of the deck -- keeping the ones that will be good as the game goes long anyway. Eventually you will hit a few spiders and if you have a way to block/stay alive it doesn't actually matter if you have 15 spiders or 3, you're going to win.

There actually is quite a bit of synergy for Cloudspeaker, it's generally not one of my favorite cards, but it accomplishes 3 things in this deck:

1) Fog an early attacker

2) Buff a flyer of which we have quite a few: (2, eggblight, cyclone rider, spirit eagle?, cyclone shaman, runeweb cultivator, infinitrix, fleshreaver, shifted flyer?)

3) Provide late game/synergy value with Martyr, Cyclone rider

Pius Paladin and Pale Harvester are definately replaceable, but with what? Their role in this deck is to be early game blockers, swiftstrike + lifedrain can keep out a lot of aggression, while a 1/4 that can sometimes gain you life is decent at that also.

Ghost feather is also not super strong, but it does offer some synergy with spent cloudspeakers/harvesters or a pious paladin that is no longer relevant.

neophyte awakener has synergy with all the 3 drops the deck has, grab an eggblight stalker back from the yard that they burned or a cloudspeaker that you already used to buff a flyer for another buff?

The point of going uzzu is to better enable the blood splash and fleshreaver happens to benefit. I wouldn't feel comfortable running 4 blood cards (2 of which you'd prefer to see in the ~early game rather than late) with less than 5 blood shards and I think the diamond/sapphire requirements of the deck cannot survive as a 6/6 or 7/5 split.

Re: mackerel mitts, also don't forget that the deck has a lot of 4 toughness troops, it doesn't have to debuff a creature to 0 for it to be effective and as you said it's GREAT against swarm and flying decks. 

Overall, I still feel like this deck would offer the most consistency and best chances of winning a best of 1 game against a random deck.  The spider deck would certainly win many games, but is potentially weak to aggressive decks.

Edit: I've found through experience that synergy is a bit weaker in sealed than it is in draft. Going back to your list of great cards for a spider deck (Which I generally agree with aside from a couple cards) it's only 11 cards -- giving room for reap/mackerel mitts/time flux you're still looking at 8-9 cards that are ""filler"".  Compare to draft where you might have 1 or 2 cards not ""on theme"" and you can imagine how much weaker a ""strong"" sealed synergy-based deck is.",2016-07-21 18:44:28+00:00,d5lawsy,3.0,t1_d5l7wfm,3763.0,hextcg

96,"I agree more with the spiders deck than the Ovo deck, however I think both of the decks still have some weaknesses that can be addressed. I think you can do even better by mixing the strengths of the two decks:

I think you have great pool for an Uzzu the Bonewalker deck.

I think your diamond is really good for locking down the early game:
2x Totem Trap
2x Cloudspeaker
Pious Paladin
Pale harvester

You have some spider cards that are great in almost any deck:
Hatchery Malvoker
2xEggblight Stalker
Runeweb Cultivator

Your Sapphire has some impactful spells/spells matter cards as well:
Thunderfield Elder
Cyclone Rider
Cyclone Shaman
Lanupaw's Sight
Mackerel Mitts (MVP)
Time Flux x2

A splashable blood removal spell that will also give you access to more thresholds:
Reap

A few good utility creatures:
Ghost Feather (Turn those cloudspeakers into threats after they've done their jobs?)
Neophyte Awakener (Buyback your Eggblight Stalkers? cloudspeakers if you have a bunch of flyers for another buff?)
Grim Martyr (Great body and can cash in your clouspeakers or a random spider for 2 cards later in the game)

And then, your bombs that will win the game by themselves!
High Infinitrix
Sepulchra Fleshreaver

I would probably run 17 shards with 8/8 split for D/S and 1 Blood shard -- the main source of blood should probably be uzzu's power since you only need 1 threshold to cast the 4 blood spells in your deck (Reap, Eggblightx2, Grim Martyr).  You could consider doing a 7/7/3 split as well, but I don't think it's safer to run 8/8/1.

130,"Yes! Say you have farmed 30k gold.  This will allow you to do a few things:


1) Spin Chests which you get from opening packs (note that entering a draft or sealed event ""opens"" packs and gives you chests in your inventory after the event).

2) Buy dust to upgrade your cards to Full Art.

3) Purchase things for gold on the AH.


Here is the other thing you can do with gold -- sell it to people for platinum!  Because #1-2 can only be done with gold, even people who buy tons of platinum will most likely want gold.  If you look in trade chat you will often see people ""WTB Gold 115:1""  (gold prices generally tend to be 110:1 to 125:1).  What this means is that they'll give you 1p for every 115 gold that you give to them.  You could ""sell"" your 30k gold for ~260 platinum and use that to buy things on the AH, buy packs, or enter tournaments!



Edit:  I'd like to caution you about playing draft to make money in the game.  I, personally, love to draft and think it's a ton of fun.  However, going ""infinite"", or getting more money back than you put in is not easy to do. Additionally, even the best players can lose to bad draws/variance, so even a player that can win more than he spends on average will still need a bankroll to absorb streaks of bad luck.

Consider that only 1 player is guaranteed to make money in a competitive draft where the payout is 5-3-2-2.  It is *likely* that 2nd place will also make a small amount of money (as long as they can sell whatever cards/chests they opened for more than the entry fee of 100p).  3-4 place, might make something if they opened a high value card, but most likely will have lost some small amount of value in the draft. Most importantly, Half of the people in the draft lose in the first round. This means that they only get to keep the cards they opened in the packs.  It is likely that they all lose money on the event.


I don't say this to scare you off from drafting -- in fact I'd encourage you to try it, and it is a great way to open any packs that you might have while both building your collection and giving yourself a chance to win some benefits. At the worst, you end up spending $1 to get a bit of experience drafting and open 3 packs.  I just want to make sure you don't go into it expecting to make ""progression"" towards building a deck you want and an ""easy way to earn gold/plat"".


If your goal is to play for free...my advice would be to farm the PVE content (arena, campaign) for gold/items to sell on the AH.  Then, turn your gold into platinum.  Once you get ~700 platinum, if you enjoy (or think you might enjoy) drafting, read a quick overview of the limited format (check this series out for the current draft format http://www.hexprimal.com/primal-dawn-limited-archetypes-part-2-ds-fiona-honeyfinch/ ) and give it a shot. Your platinum will go pretty close to 0 if you don't win the first match, but you do get to keep whatever cards you pick.

If you'd rather just play constructed, keep saving up the plat/gold until you can buy whatever cards you want!",2016-05-16 16:24:31+00:00,d37mngf,3.0,t1_d35vydj,137659.0,hextcg

178,"Well, if that's the case, I'd agree that is an issue with the law as written. I was under the impression that it allowed businesses the right to refuse specific requests that did not align with their beliefs. 

By the way, how would a store even know that private info about a customer to use it as a basis for general discrimination/ isn't it already against the law to practice general discrimination against protected groups. I still feel that the intent was probably to allow refusal of specific requests...not a requestor. Or allow refusal of a *specific* service such a wedding.

In the small/tight-knit community I don't think a law will affect the hostility of that environment. Unfortunately, regardless of the law, those people are in for a bad time.",2016-04-06 19:38:29+00:00,d1sjn0d,7.0,t1_d1sht6g,2241.0,news
179,"I'm not trying to make a straw man. I think arguing that someone can't grocery shop is more of a straw man than going in depth on the subject of cakes that may fall into the category of ""against religious beliefs"". Grocery stores aren't really religious organizations or small businesses where the owners personal religious beliefs would be a factor though, so I'm not sure the original scenario can even happen.

I tried to address his point by saying I think there's a pretty big line between refusing to serve and refusing to accommodate specific requests. I don't think the business or religious organizations should be forced to accomidate specific requests that directly oppose their beliefs. However, general service/ability to shop is not a specific request and is/should be allowed and protected.

I would fully support a Muslim bakery that didn't want to make an Easter cake or a Jewish bakery that didn't want to make a ""Christ is risen"" pastry. I wouldn't expect a Hindu temple to agree to perform a marriage for me, as I don't practice that religion.

Lastly, in those small communities, a law will not make those situations more or less awkward. In those cases, what's wrong with going to the nearest courthouse, which is a government facility and get married using that service?",2016-04-06 18:50:15+00:00,d1sha2j,5.0,t1_d1sfk60,2157.0,news

I would expect a shop to sell a blank cake to anyone. But when it comes to personalization/purpose building, I think it's a different story.

I don't think a baker should have to make an isis cake if that makes them uncomfortable, nor a booby/penis cake for a bachelor(ette) party. A restaurant shouldn't be legally compelled to serve peanut free foods for those with alergies. A church doesn't have to provide marraige services for straight couples they feel live outside of their beliefs (christian+non Christian marriage, couples that live together/openly sex before marriage) ... why force them to perform a ritual/satisfy a request that is in opposition to their beliefs (even outdated ones)?",2016-04-06 17:36:40+00:00,d1sdqkt,3.0,t1_d1saso5,3672.0,news

I have Karlsson, Tavares, Pheneuf, Ludqvist, Rask :'(, and a few other players that are way too expensive for me to consider keeping next year.  If one of the teams who has a legit shot at first wants to trade away some keepers to get a steady producer to help them secure the money this year, that's a good, fair trade.   For example, getting Taylor Hall as a keeper from someone who needs Defensive help to close out this season in exchange for Karlsson, or swapping an unkeepable Lundqvist for a keepable Schneider -- who just went out for a couple weeks.

Those are trades that probably wouldn't happen in the beginning/middle of the season, but as it comes time to push, it's totally legitimate for the players who are out of it to posture for next season and sell stars to the contenders.

Edit: To clarify, in a keeper league, the ""spare players"" that can be dumped for stars are usually prospects, injured stars, or players that are worth considerably more than what was paid for them (in an auction draft league).",2016-03-08 18:55:18+00:00,d0schx1,,t1_d0mp6bz,,fantasyhockey

Who do I start?

Robin Lehner or no one?

It's a Rotisserie league and counts W GAA SV% and SHO. We have 2 active goalie slots and 180 games at that position over the season.  My other 2 goalies are Tuukka Rask and Martin Jones (who looked great last night!)

It's been a while since I've been in a league and I'd like some general advice. Do I put in Lehner for a chance at another win and accept the risk that my SV% (0.95) and GAA (1) of this young season take a hit? The only goalie volume stat is wins (maybe you count SHO? but I don't expect too many SHO from Lehner/Buf anyway).

My initial instinct is to keep him on the bench until I can see how his team is performing in front of him and throw him in only if A) He wont screw up my sv% or GAA too badly or B) My other goalies start sucking in those categories as well.  Is that right or should I be playing him any time there is an open G slot in the daily roster?",2015-10-08 15:44:53+00:00,cvskrtg,1.0,t3_3nyntr,13168.0,fantasyhockey

**[Les Revenants (the returned)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2521668/)**: There is an American TV show based off of this, but the original French TV show is interesting. It's mysterious, creepy, and intriguing. Focused on a girl who comes back from the dead several years later and herself, her family, and town all deal with it throughout the show.

**[Continuum](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1954347/?ref_=nv_sr_1)**. A Canadian sci-fi show where corporations have taken over the world and several terrorists go back in time (with a cop). The terrorists goal is to change the future and the cop wants to stop them.

**[Lilyhammer](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1958961/?ref_=nv_sr_1)**. Netflix's first original series. It doesn't seem to get much attention. It is about a NY mobster who is displaced to the peaceful town of Lilyhammer, Norway. He brings his values, business practices and personality to their country and the contrasting ways of life are really entertaining. The first couple episodes seem a bit cheesy, but everyone settles into their roles and the show just keeps gaining steam.

What if they say there are no issues with abortions being legal in cases of danger to the mother, the child, or cases of rape? Give away all the birth control you want, educate people on failure rates and ways to reduce the chances of pregnancy with multiple forms of birth control, and warn ahead of time that if a baby is still conceived, you should be prepared to deliver. Increase programs to assist mothers with adoption, and offer assistance with pregnancy related medical expenses during that period. Not trying to make pregnancy profitable for the person, but offer a smoother path than ""you now have an unexpected ordeal, it's your fault and deal with it"" that seems to be popular among the pro life crowd.

315,"I think this needs to be higher up.

I see a lot of posts saying how great this relationship with WoW is. And don't get me wrong, I think WoW is great too, but reading this story also made concerned for the OP and sad for the stuff that they had to deal with. 

OP, it sounds like you're holding on to a lot of painful experiences. It saddens me that you went through so many hard times growing up. However, I'm worried that pushing all those things behind WoW is going to become unsustainable at some point, especially as you get older. I don't want to alarm you or tell you that wow isn't the answer, because it probably does have a role. But I do want to encourage you to talk to someone about your feelings.

I would like to second the comment above this. Please talk about this with a teacher you trust, counsellor, or doctor. Growing up, it seems like WoW is really all you've had and known and it would be a big help if there was someone who could help you unload some of the weight you're carying around. To work through some of the issues you're dealing with while you are still able to offset their burden with WoW. ",2015-07-22 16:54:00+00:00,ctca8zo,2.0,t1_ctc4nn6,8225.0,wow

321,"This tip seems to make sense, but could you give some example gifs? I went through a lot of the GIFs of goals/arial shots and almost all of them moved from underneath my finger.

Since the camera is a 3rd person viewpoint, I'm not sure if the tip is 100% true. e.g. if a ball is on the corner of your screen where you only see 1/4 of it, but that 1/4 keeps getting bigger and bigger, you aren't necessarily going to hit that ball (I would expect it to work if the camera was first person)?

326,"Here's the passage I was referring to. From Book 13, Chapter 20:

&gt;Beirut, as a Sovereign’s Emissary, naturally knew many secrets.
&gt;
&gt;Linley stared, speechless.
&gt;
&gt;Even Sovereigns would struggle and compete for the sake of such geniuses.
&gt;
&gt;“If one could reach such a level, one could truly feel proud of one’s self.” Linley felt some envy of those experts. Only they were truly peak level experts.
&gt;
&gt;“Beginning to sense the fusibility from the beginning. Only then will your future accomplishments be great.” Beirut laughed self-mockingly. “For example, myself. In the past, I didn’t know these things. By the time I reached the Highgod level and wanted to fuse them, it was too late. Fuse several mysteries of the Laws into one at the same time? It is too hard.”
&gt;
&gt;Linley couldn’t help but feel grateful towards Beirut.
&gt;
&gt;Although Beirut had only given him slight guidance, to him, this was as good as pointing out a brand new path for him.
&gt;
&gt;Two paths. If one embarked on the wrong path from the beginning, at the end, the difference between the two paths would be immeasurably great.
&gt;
&gt;Most likely, after reaching the Highgod level, he would become like Beirut, completely unable to fuse anything.",2015-07-10 19:48:15+00:00,csyxxl3,6.0,t1_csyvm0w,3379.0,LightNovels
