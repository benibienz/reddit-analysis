The gif *does* load if I click on the link and then watch it on the relay browser, but not if I try to open it from the thumbnail. 

I'm running android 6.0.1 on a Nexus 7.

Any ideas?

Edit: it usually loads up to about 1s, but I've had them stop at 5/7/10s as well.

Edit 2: I first noticed this happening around the time the zooming for gifs was enabled, is that related?

Edit 3: Here is another thread/gif that is also on gphycat, slightly longer that works with no issues: https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/5c8afu/til_dvas_mech_can_emote_while_exploding/

First of all,  I love Hex. I think it's a great game with tons of value. However, over the past few days I've noticed a few negative posts.  I don't see them on the sub anymore and it concerns me that they may have been removed.  If they weren't removed, I apologize! If they were removed, then I'm a bit disappointed.

We have a great community surrounding this game and I think we handled those threads pretty well. I took about 20 minutes of my lunch to respond to one of those topics today and I don't see the thread anymore.  Now, it's not really a big concern for me that my response was lost, but I AM worried that negative threads are (apparently) being silenced.  While the initial post may have seemed shallow and ""trolling"" the op actually did take some time to defend his positions in the comments. Furthermore, I could see people who have heard some of those complaints or issues being exaggerated elsewhere coming here to do research. Shouldn't we as a community be open to talking about these subjects?  I think reddit, at its core, is very well suited to handle this kind of thing.

Lastly,  we can tolerate negative opinions because everyone has a different perspective.  Maybe coming to understand someone's motivations and thought process will allow us to help them overcome their issues with the game.  Maybe the game is just not for them.  That's ok.  If someone is actually trolling, I'd encourage the community to let reddit handle it by itself. We have down votes :).

TL:DR I don't believe we should delete threads.  People provide valuable perspective that can be useful later and Reddit is already built to push undesirable content to the bottom by itself.",hextcg,[META] Removal of Negative Posts,https://www.reddit.com/r/hextcg/comments/54nb6i/meta_removal_of_negative_posts/

However, I have been increasingly frustrated with the amount of deleted comments on many subreddits.

Perhaps treating deleted comments like spoilers, where you don't have to look at the deleted comments if you don't want to would be good enough? A prime example is the *main* David Cameron resignation thread.  The top 2 comments are (were) deleted with over 500 replies and enough upvotes to get them to the top of that thread.  Using some 3rd party websites to check some of the deleted comments leaves me confused as to why they were deleted in the first place.  For example:

""Corbyn has to go too, the useless fucking prick. (Did you do all you could to prevent this disaster, Jeremy? Did you fuck.) The country desperately needs an effective opposition.""

"" It's literally like putting all your chips on black on the roulette table.. The gamble might pay off... but it also might totally go tits up""

"" If the EU was what it should have been, which is a free trade agreement within its members that helped support and grow business it would have been great. In reality, it has become a draconian group that tells independent nations the laws the must pass and follow. Everyone is saying the pound will be affected, wait until this hits the Euro. They are being carried by the UK and Germany, its going to be tough.""

Maybe there is some reason the mods of that sub don't want people to see these opinions, perhaps some of them could be considered offensive? Either way, I don't think it would hurt anyone to allow people to opt into reading a deleted comment on a case by case basis.

Lastly, in the event of comments that need to be removed to prevent witch hunting/ exposing real people's information -- perhaps a seperate ""purge"" option could be given to mods that requires them to input a (visible to readers) explanation for removal of the comment?  Yes, this is more work, but it probably should be...the ""spoiler"" delete would be the fast easy way for them to delete comments.",ideasfortheadmins,Deleted Comments Should be Treated Like Spoilers,https://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/4pnfl9/deleted_comments_should_be_treated_like_spoilers/

Assumptions:

1) All packs won are sold for 167p on the AH

2) All entry fees are paid for by submitting your own packs (bought for 167p from the AH) + the entry fee

3) the 3 ""common &amp; uncommon"" packs are each worth opening a 1/4 pack?

4) Since you can't go infinite in either format, the comparison will be made based on how much platinum was spent for each ""opened"" pack.

So, Here's how my numbers broke down based on number of wins you achieve in (regular|evo) cost-per-pack opened format [lower is better]:

Win 0, (200.33|157.82)

Win 1, (172.5  |115.73)

Win 2, (144.67|115.73)

Win 3, (116.83| 91.37)

Win 4, (89      |  91.37)

Win 5, (33.33  | 56.21)

So, the Evo gauntlet is a more cost effective way to open packs until you get to 4 wins, at 4 wins they are more or less the same, and at 5 wins (because of the bonus pack) the conventional gauntlet is more cost effective.  Hopefully this helps you decide what to play!

Edit: valuing the 3 ""common and uncommon"" packs as 0 opened packs instead of 3/4 of an opened pack, the values are (200|217)(172|145)(145|145)(116|108)(89|108)(33|66).  However, I don't think it's fair to count them as 0 since they do have *some* value.",hextcg,Some napkin math comparing the value of evolving Sealed Gauntlet value to regular Sealed Gauntlet,https://www.reddit.com/r/hextcg/comments/4gvv3q/some_napkin_math_comparing_the_value_of_evolving/
