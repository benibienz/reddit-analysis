* I would strongly suggest checking out Springfield leather, and picking up a [pre-cut piece.](http://springfieldleather.com/30415/Piece%2CHermann-Oak%2C5-6oz12%22x12%22/) Save some money that way. Get the 3/4 oz veg tan, it will be firm and thin enough for the strap.

* Use a utility knife and a fresh blade for your cuts. Don't use your pocket knife.

* You should always sew over gluing. Glue will eventually dry out and fail on you.

* Don't use a thick belt blank, like /u/benzethonium mentions, you will be skiving all day long. Not worth the effort when you can buy the leather already split down.

* Practice on pieces of heavy cardstock before working on leather. You can fine-tune your design much faster and waste a lot less material.

200,"&gt; This sort of blind attacking on anyone is one of the reasons why this subreddit has become so toxic lately. Bitpay is one of the few bitcoin businesses that have REALLY helped this space become what it is today.

I would argue that payment processing companies hurting small business is pretty toxic.

&gt; If OP had done basic due diligence before engaging a payments provider like Bitpay

Here's OP's due dilligence you mention: https://support.bitpay.com/hc/en-us/articles/201890513-What-are-my-options-for-settlement-# where it states a $100 minimum balance for CAD (not $1000 that was just imposed). I have been using them just fine for about a year until they imposed this arbitrary settlement a few days ago.

&gt; Bitcoin is TINYYYY and we really a community effort to have it grow.

In order for BTC to grow, the community should be helping people like me accept and trade it. Not collect it as an investment.

&gt; So please try to be friendly to each other and stop the mob-like behaviour.
