I recently discovered cork turntable mats, but hated the way they stuck to my records.. so I came up with [these](http://imgur.com/a/M9j5T).

After 2 weeks of spinning on my modest Denon-DP300F with a Cherry CXL mat, I have found:

* Dust and lint will not stick to the leather mat; easy to clean 
* Won't build up a static charge: reduces clicks and pops
* Bass seems deeper, less residual noise

**I am giving 5 away. To enter, just reply below and I'll pick five people at random. Contest ends Monday during the day sometime. I'll update this post with winners and contact them directly.**

I am genuinely curious to hear what the r/vinyl community thinks and would love to get first-hand feedback from the winners. 

*Also, I should mention I cleared this with the mods before posting* :)
