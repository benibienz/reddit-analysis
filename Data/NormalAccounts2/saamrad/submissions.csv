I don't really see any benefits in making cricket popular in the US except seeing less of the 'what is this game, shit baseball? xD' comments on Reddit. Clearly the majority of young Americans don't have the temperament for watching or playing cricket, and that is totally fine. Its a sport with fairly high barriers to entry both culturally and practically. 

I believe that as a community we shouldn't think that cricket needs the USA's validation to remain a world class sport. Cricket has its own proud history that has thrived without America's help or influence. Some games just aren't meant to become the most 'global' sports. 

Instead of trying to force the game on America, the ICC needs to help professional development in Asia and Afrcia, where the game already has cultural roots.

I have looked at buying guides, and it seems that most of the suggestions have not had official Australian releases. Furthermore, the ones that have (e.g. the Dell Chromebook 13 w/ 16gb) carry a ridiculous price tag (nearly 1000 dollars).

As can be seen this version of silent mode incorporates the features of 'priority mode' through an intuitive exceptions menu which can be manually tweaked.
