Crafting a new single player chapter would be pretty expensive and maybe 1000 people would buy it for the single player chapter alone.

From an attacker's point of view it makes much more sense--you get 1-3 points for each of 9 sectors, you fight through to the end and you get a score out of 27, you fail early and you can't achieve the full 27 points. This is totally fair enough. Then it makes sense to have an XP bonus for actually winning.

For a defender the score should *start* at 27 and then count down for every sector you fail to defend. So if you hold the enemy at the first sector and get a 3/3 defense rating you'd score 27. If you lose that sector with a 1/3 defense rating but then hold the next one with a 2/3 and win, you'd get 24/27 (21 + 2 + 1). You should get your XP bonus for eventually stopping the enemy.

It should never go negative for either defenders or attackers...even if you defend badly for all 9 sectors you should get 9/27 under this system.

It couldn't be more simple. It's tremendous, it really is. It's the best defense/attack rating.

First of all, why the hell is it out of 27? Let's see...are there 9 stages to the Operation? If so that would make sense, as you're rated out of 3 for defending each stage. So if you put up a 3/3 defense for all 9 stages you should get 27/27.

But of course, if you put up a 3/3 defense for all 9 stages then you *failed really well* because the attackers pushed you back to each stage and eventually won. So it can't be right, surely. It would have to give you 3 points for all the stages you didn't need to play, plus the score out of 3 for the stages you did play. So 6/27 for a defender who held the enemy back at the first stage makes no sense at all.

Don't get me started on why it's sometimes -17,546/27.

The rating out of 27 also seems to have no bearing on the Minor/Major Victory/Defeat score. I have no idea where that comes from. Maybe total lives lost on the defender's side are factored in? Maybe defender lives aren't as expendable as we thought?

66,"I've noticed a big change in the general level of tactical play over the weekend. I think people are learning the maps. Until now I've argued that E and F on Fao Fortress (conquest) should just be abandoned to the enemy as they'll all hang back in the fort doing nothing for a half hour while you can easily cap all the other points--but in my last match on Fao Fortress we were pinned down at B and just couldn't seem to catch a break because they actually used the field guns and the height advantage. So now E and F can potentially swing the game with the right players. I love that.

In Amiens for example there are alleyways that offer a pretty safe journey between A and E/F if you cross the tracks instead of using the bridges, and for the first time I met enemy squads pushing up and trying to flank us before we even held the bridges. One guy was perched on the back of a light tank. We got them just outside of E but it was great to see--it's important to go off script now and then.

75,"I should preface this with the disclaimer that I'm usually only in the upper middle in games with the occasional MVP if I'm lucky. On any given day my K/D can range between 0.8 and 2.0 depending on the skill of the opposing team. It's definitely trending upwards as I work towards surviving encounters and flanking enemies.

1) set your sensitivity to 100, set your ADS sensitivity to 100. Some others advise low sensitivity instead so I guess it's personal preference. Whatever gets you more shots on target for a given time frame. 

2) in advanced options (under Control or Gameplay, I don't recall), turn on the option that allows uniform aiming feel for all weapons, don't alter the coefficient. I have aim assist auto rotation off but aim assist slowdown on.
 
3) now, play some games, get accustomed to the feel of the aiming. You want to nudge your right stick and have it land exactly where you want in one movement without correcting back the other way. Similarly for leading targets, you'll want to get to a point where you find just the right amount of pressure instantly. I am still not great at this (if I'm caught by surprise I'll shoot right above your head) but every time you have a long play session then sleep on it, you will get better.

4) stop running around corners, only run from cover to cover. Walk more, pay attention to your reticle size, don't bother shooting if you are suppressed. If you sprint into a close range 1v1 you will lose against just about everything no matter what you're carrying--it takes time to raise your gun and recover accuracy. It takes time to aim so you are more likely to win a fight with a enemy who doesn't know you're there--so once you see an enemy, work out a way to flank them. When you're creeping up in the blind spot from their 4 o'clock to their 8 o'clock you have all the time in the world to aim...you'll get some beautiful low-effort multi-kills this way as lots of people have poor general awareness.

5) use a low recoil weapon, damage is a secondary consideration, hits are more important

6) know the effective range of your weapon and don't be tempted to use it beyond that range unless you are under direct threat and can't get to cover. Sniping with the MP 18 or the Automatico will just alert your enemy to your position without hurting them much.

7) as you play the maps you'll get an instinct for where an enemy is likely to reappear if they go behind cover or into a building. Think about what direction they seem to be running, what point they might be trying to get to. Form a theory of mind of your enemy. Does he know you're there? Where's the next bit of cover if he decides to make a dash? I get so many kills just from being ready with the crosshairs very slightly beyond wherever I think the enemy will emerge. He pops up, I take the shot, he runs into it.

8) practice with your grenades (throw them at about 45 degrees) until you can land them on targets with decent accuracy at long range. Very useful for hunting tanks from a safe(r) distance as Assault and sending your enemies sprinting out of cover as any class--if someone's sprinting and even slightly damaged and you're not, you have a advantage over them. Even better if they are a screaming pillar of flame.

9) consider changing the hit colors in your gameplay settings--one color for a body hit, a different color for a headshot hit. This way you get instant visual feedback so you can fine-tune your aim for the headshot. I've also changed my reticle color away from the white default to make it stand out against the dominant greys and whites of the game. I use a sort of gold color which really stands out.

10) I use the Kontrol Freek clip-on extender things for the sticks. They are nice and rubbery, and the 5mm-or-so extension gives you better fine control. 

11) Don't forget you can move slightly with your left stick to fine-tune where your bullets are hitting. If you strafe 1 inch to your left, your bullets are going to hit 1 inch to the left of where they were hitting before (in a perfect world). Sometimes this is faster than trying to move your right stick 0.00001 degrees. Similarly you can predict how your foes will move and move in the same direction without touching your right stick to keep bullets landing on them--beware the accuracy penalty that comes from walking around though.

12) Don't be tempted to crank your FOV up too high. You'll gain peripheral vision but lose vital detail in the center of your screen. Go for 85-90 max.

13) Not a super-important point but I turned off motion blur and weapon depth-of-field. Turning off motion blur helps with threat identification for me--recognizing the dude crouched in corner when you scan a room for example. Weapon DOF is personal preference but I like things as crisp as possible.

Assault does well in Domination. Consider the MP 18 Trench for close work with the anti-tank grenades (one more thing to throw at enemies) or the AT rocket gun (although it leaves you exposed and you need hits on the body for a kill--useful for destroying cover though). Dynamite is good for locked doors and laying devilish traps (and in Conquest it's my favorite way to kill Cavalry...lay dynamite and bait them towards you). In your grenade slot I would go for gas--it has the double benefit of damaging foes and forcing them to put on their gas masks. If yours is already on when you walk through the mist shooting, you have an advantage. Call for resupply when you run out.

I've also had good luck with the Model 10 shotgun--a one-shot kill but your shot has to hit home. I like the slug version.

For Support the BAR storm or MG15 are great. The BAR is very accurate but has a small magazine. Again, walk with it in battle, start shooting at center mass then nudge the stick up to aim for the head. Hip fire most of the time. If you find yourself aiming down sights, ask yourself if you are trying to snipe with an LMG...not a good idea unless you are intentionally going for the suppression to help a teammate (you will be easily outsniped by medics or scouts). I just [got the 5-kill killstreak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HnRUg6wl80) for the Support medal with the BAR and honestly it was good training for every other weapon. Rewatching my video I notice it was all just body shots but it does the job at that range. People say the LMGs are underpowered, I think there's some truth to that but also people are trying to use them as assault rifles. The MG15 is another killstreak monster and can clear a room with one pull of the trigger *but you need to get the drop on your foes*.

The Medic guns are all pretty fantastic as far as I can see. The default gun (Cei-Riggoti?) is excellent in single-fire mode at medium range and can switch to automatic fire that can easily take someone out at close range. Just beware of the fairly slow reload. With these you usually want to be aiming down sights.

I haven't played any Scout in BF1 yet so I can't comment much on that, just be aware of bullet drop and lead your targets.",2016-11-14 13:19:27+00:00,d9zqxwi,2.0,t1_d9zpvv9,2514.0,battlefield_one

- Park it on C: you can hold C for a long time, but consider positioning for your machine guns and make sure they can cover both ends of the bridge. Keep that mortar firing on the paths coming from A/B. 

- Pull back to defend D/E: the train will probably last longer, but the guys at the back of the train will be useless and will abandon it, meaning you can be countered easily. Proper use of the mortar will keep the enemy out of D/E indefinitely though.

133,"Yeah it's really not a great system. 

Personally I'd like a per-match or per-session ribbon system like before, with minor achievements tracked constantly and achievable multiple times. That was fun. Then a medal system that rotates weekly would also be fine *in addition* (maybe with single-stage daily medals as well)...but for god's sake track all the medals simultaneously. And they should refine the medals a bit, some of them are unachievable unless you really ignore all objectives and play like a complete dick.

That way DICE still have the opportunity to steer the community based on observed behaviour (like they could put a few 'PTFO'-related medals up there at the minute).

I have some ideas for medals to encourage good play...

- Capture the flag closest to your opponent's base (20 times)
- Retake any flag that has exchanged hands at least once (20 times)
- Take (as in be personally involved in taking) *every flag* at least once in a conquest match (5 times)
- Achieve 20 kills in defense of a flag
- Hold any flag alone against a single opponent for more than 10 minutes total (cumulative across games)
- Spawn on any squadmate (100 times)
- Lock 50 doors
- Blow open 50 doors
- As tail gunner, defend a bomber from attackers 5 times
- As an airship driver, capture any point (5 times)
- As an airship driver, achieve more than 20 kills in one round (easily doable but my teammates never seem to do it)
- As a driver of any behemoth, with every position crewed, each crew member achieves at least 1 kill (I want drivers to consider positioning for anyone other than themselves)
- As a tank driver, with every position crewed, each crew member achieves at least 1 kill (5 times)
- As a scout, move more than 50m between kills (20 times)
- Follow any squad order (20 times)
- Give any squad order (20 times)
- Lead the highest-performing squad in a round (5 times)
- Plug in your goddamn mic and use it (console only)

Some map-specific ideas as well...I'm sure there are more...

- In Fao Fortress, win even though you conceded E and F to your opponent for more than half the game (easy mode: conceding E and F is currently the easiest way to take *everything else*, I just wish people would realize it)
- In Fao Fortress, get 5 kills with any field gun on the fortress walls (so many times I see them going unused while scouts watch tanks roll up to the door)
- Get 5 vehicle kills with the mortars at B and D on Monte Grappa (so many times my team has held B or D and the big guns sit idle while tanks roll in from A or E)

Another system could be that squad leaders each choose a medal to focus on from a pool of medals at the start of the game. Their whole squad get the medal and XP if they successfully work together to fulfill the requirements. That way a clever squad leader could adjust their squad's gameplay across multiple rounds. I think squad leaders need to be able to offer more direction and incentives...medals could be a way to do that.

I just took command of the airship in Ballroom Blitz while my team was about 200 points down.

I think it ended about 818-1000.

It occurred to me that the behemoths are really only a distraction and they are unlikely to alter the fortunes of a bad team. 

They are fun for the losing team to tool around in, and they definitely keep things interesting for the winning team. The airship is an amazing spectacle and it makes the driver feel like a god of destruction. But strategically they are a kind of trap...they keep players away from the flags where they should be.

A C-level talent can make a living by aiming to crank out more pages per day (or aiming for 1 page a day but also being their own inking and coloring team).

Think of your bladder. It's a bag of hot water, right? Now imagine a bag full of hot carbonated water. Pretty soon that hot carbonated water is going to go flat like a glass of delicious Coca Cola^**tm** left too long in the warm summer sun! 

So where does the carbon dioxide go? Well, it floats to the top! Most people have a pocket of CO^*2* in their bladder. Right now your CO^*2* pocket is probably pretty big--you probably feel bloated. Given time, the bacteria in your kidneys will sequester that CO^*2* into a substance that is very much like crude oil. This oil will leak back into your blood where it will gather in your extremities and brain tissue. Carbonated drinks manufacturers assure us that kidney oil is harmless and absolutely in no way responsible for the increase in senior dementia and erectile dysfunction since the invention of carbonation!

One thing to be careful of, of course--don't try to pee upside down! The CO^*2* pocket will escape into your pee tube and hot gas will whistle from your member or rasp wetly from your beefy cleft.

This frozen hemisphere then sunk into the liquid hemisphere, and liquid Mercury spilled over it to form a continuous liquid ocean, which immediately froze solid again and sunk towards the core.

So why doesn't the side facing the sun melt? Well, space is very very cold. Space is actually colder than the sun is hot!

Solid mustard only exists at very low temperatures, and has only been created a few times in the lab (usually when the fridge is turned down too low and sandwiches near the cooling element begin to freeze).

The use of mustard gas is specifically banned by the Geneva convention, but since then governments have experimented with other vaporized condiments in an effort to get around international law.

So when people were married (usually around 18) they began having children immediately, who in turn were married with kids at around 18, proving that the parents were 'grand' parents and had not messed around with contraception or taught their children about it.

308,"This is a great question that I often use to explain Einstein's Twin Paradox to my class. 

Einstein had a twin brother Allister. Allister was just as smart as Albert but for some reason he didn't enjoy any of Albert's success with the ladies. When Albert and Allister got together to investigate this *Twin Paradox*, Albert soon spotted where their lives had diverged as adults--Albert took daily showers while his brother preferred long baths.

Upon closer inspection, Albert noticed that Allister's face was smooth and his hair was solid black--a fresh-faced boyishness that women of that era found repugnant. Albert himself had pronounced crow's feet, greying hair and other distinguishing male features, and thus he was drowning in early 20th century puss. 

Albert turned to his slide rules and chalkboards and found a solution in what he would come to call Special Relativity, a theory named after special kinds of relatives (like twins). 

He realized that the fast-moving water droplets emitted by his shower bent spacetime very slightly around them as they shot towards Earth. When they impacted his skin and slowed/spread out, the spacetime dimples surrounding each droplet would rebound, very slightly accelerating time in a region a few millimeters from the point of impact. The combined effect of millions of these impacts over months and years of showering was that Einstein's skin was years older than that of his brother, who bathed in stationary water!

The answer to your shower ageing problem is simply to use slower droplets. As long as the droplets are not moving faster than their natural terminal velocity in the local gravitational field you should have no problem. This is why 'rain' style shower heads and organic non-accelerated water are so popular these days. Also you should get your system tested for heavy water, which has more mass (and thus bends spacetime more) than normal water.",2016-09-19 15:44:49+00:00,d7t8x7s,1.0,t3_53hu3d,4104.0,shittyaskscience

You are correct to say that actual years can only be measured from the point when the first concentration of gas we would eventually call 'Earth' began to orbit the sun, but we can measure backwards from that point using imaginary or sidereal years. It's just like how imaginary numbers are the square roots of negative numbers that we imagine to be actual numbers for the purposes of our calculations.

330,"I have a good story or two. As a gay man in my 50s trying to find *that special life partner* in rural Alaska dating gets weird. Lots of the guys I meet are super-macho ex-roughneck types coming to terms with themselves for the first time. It's cute in many ways but sometimes they drop serious clangers in conversation.

- They ask about AIDS because of course we *all* had AIDS in the 80s. I met one guy who was obsessed with the idea of avoiding AIDS, so much so that he wore a condom when I blew him. Needless to say, no second date was forthcoming. NEXT.

- 'Where does the gay accent come from?' Yeah I get that now and then, usually from self-hating queers. I tell them it comes from deep-throating just to see their eyes widen. NEXT.

- 'T-Top or b-bottom?' Bitch I like to mix it up. So many of these guys see themselves as all-powerful alpha-top He-Men and the idea of getting fucked a little now and then disgusts them. NEXT. 

- 'Could you take off the neckerchief?' It's a cravate you lumberjack-looking whore. I wear it to make my old turkey neck look nice. But some guys don't want to be seen around an obvious homo, so NEXT.

- 'Can we just go back to my truck?' I didn't come this far just to get chloroformed and turned into a pair of lampshades, psycho. N-E-X-T.",2016-09-15 21:44:37+00:00,d7oeol6,1.0,t3_52yhp0,1329.0,AskReddit

We want her to have the chance to mother some dachshund pups before she is too old, with the intention of keeping one or two pups ourselves and gifting the others to some interested friends from church. 

My brother-in-law decided to prey upon our good intentions and 'brokered a deal' with the owner of a sire of good pedigree. We trusted him, he took our money, he took Dorothy for the weekend, and she came back pregnant. Later I met the owner of the sire of the pups through work and we got to talking about the pedigree documents, he explained that he had received no money and his dog was a dachshund corgi schnauzer mix with learning difficulties.

353,"Let's imagine some kind of deadly gastric virus hits everyone over 29.9 years old (Logan's Runs or something). In my scenario we already have developed technology and civilisation up to this point and there is a great dying-off over the next six months.

Let's think about keeping the lights on and fridges full. First of all, the adult workforce is going to be a fraction of what it was before, and we'll lose a massive amount of expertise in every field. Medicine, engineering, industry and science will be devastated. My father is 60-year-old electrical engineer, and according to him the generation coming up to replace him does not have anything like necessary practical knowledge to run the important medical facilities he maintains. Grade inflation has been a real issue over the last few decades and universities are diploma mills that churn out graduates that are useful for very little--they need to be trained from the ground up. This is a real concern he has *right now*, our fantasy world aside. So men would need to start work early in life (14, say), with apprenticeships from older workers, and people currently breezing long in their twenties would hit the old manuals *hard* to keep things ticking. Some disciplines will disappear altogether, and with them many of the modern conveniences we enjoy. We'd be lucky to maintain something like 1940's levels of tech.

Women will become rare in the workforce as they will need to start having children as soon as they can.

Attitudes to reproduction will change drastically in a generation. Girls will need to have children at about 15/16 if they want enough time to impart useful knowledge to them. (The alternative is that women have children in their early twenties that they will never see grow up, but they also adopt the 8 year old kids of their dead relatives...it will take a village to raise a child).

Education will need to be accelerated and highly practical, preparing students for the handful of jobs that keep civilisation running. They will need to be sorted by aptitude early and forced down a handful of specific paths. On the other hand there will be no shortage of jobs for kids of every level of ability.

There *are* some benefits, believe it or not. There will be no shortage of housing for a long time, if ever. The retirees that we maintain today will be gone. Half the books on medicine are *geriatric* medicine...hospitals will be more or less empty outside of the maternity wards. It's hard to judge if the massive redistribution of wealth and the massively shrunken world economy will play out to the advantage of the average middle-aged employed 22-year-old. 

Everything I've said so far is a best-case scenario based on everyone keeping their heads and balancing self-interest and altruism. But take a drive down any street around rush hour and you'll see that about 1/5 of people are idiots and about 1/5 are just outright sociopaths. They will need law and order, structure, government.

Who will govern this brave new world? Communities will need to self-govern far more than they do today. Existing constitutions would need to be heavily edited. It's hard to imagine a single coherent nation taking orders from a 25-year-old President...where did he or she *learn to govern?* I might even expect a regression towards families of ruling elites (ha...or at least the dispelling of today's illusion of democracy) simply from the practical standpoint that it's easier to train new elites if they are your children, nephews and nieces, and it appeals to human self-interest.",2016-09-14 15:18:48+00:00,d7mh48h,1.0,t3_52qu3y,1726.0,AskReddit

Like **Doctor Soot** has the ability to tell if a chimney has a dangerous level of soot buildup, so he can prevent chimney fires. Pretty useful.

Or **Mycellia** can bend a few grams of fungi to her will at any given time, so she mostly just helps people suffering from athlete's foot or thrush. She'd be a godsend if you were suffering from a bout of jock itch.

**Floppy Joe** automatically backs up and versions saved files in computers within 100 feet to a mystical data storage device that uses the very substrate of the universe itself as data storage. Handy guy to have around the office if Excel decides to eat your spreadsheet ten minutes before a big meeting.

**Extendron** is a being made entirely of USB extender cables, growing new ones every day. If you need a USB extender cable for a phone charger or a console controller he's your man (or woman, as he has both male and female parts).

**Tro John the Sheather** stalks the city by night helping out dudes who really need a condom but can't get to a pharmacy or find a machine.

**The Gelder** can remove anyone's genetalia at a glance. Just straight-up blanks them down below leaving naught but a puckered pisshole. He drives around in an indescript mid-2000s Japanese car gelding anyone who cuts him off, or fails to indicate at a junction, or overtakes dangerously, etc etc etc.

Thanks to a mysterious alien implant, **Stylene** can control up to sixty pounds of styrofoam or polystyrene at a time. She's very useful after Christmas when you have a garage full of packing material and when you try to break it up it turns into styrofoam dust with all that static cling.

**Christmax** somehow always knows the optimal gift (under $200) for your wife or girlfriend at Christmas. He is a reclusive sage, sought by legions of desperate men around mid-December. His sidekick **Birthdave** has a similar power that works for birthdays.

**Lawn Order** has the ability to communicate with grass and tell it to stop growing at a specific height. 

After getting struck by lightning while running a virus scan on his PC, **Alan** can detect when any mother within 50 miles is about to download malware. He has yet to come to terms with his ability as his mind is forever awash with images of middle-aged women ignoring download warnings and giving admin privileges to shit with names like MemBoosterDownloadCompanionNavBar++ that promises to 'very clean' their hard drive and 'make great the experience of browse internet'.

    1000 * (5.1 + 1) = 6100
    6100 / 4 = 1525 pixels

So that's a 61 * 25 RGBA image, closer to the ball park of two low-res emoticons side by side.

For RGB:

    6100 / 3 = 2034 pixels (rounding up from 2033.333...)

356,"The alpha channel is (usually) a measure of the amount of opacity of the pixel.

If you had a pixel that had an alpha value of 127 (half the maximum value of a byte) it would be semitransparent. At 255 it would be totally opaque, and at 0 it would be totally transparent (I might have the scale backwards but you get the idea). It's useful when you are composing multiple images together and you want the background to show through part of your image. You could build a 3D model of a car and use RGBA textures to allow for tinted windows, for example.

358,"Let's work it out based on a raw uncompressed RGBA image with no additional size for a header etc. That's an image with three color channels and an alpha channel, one byte for each red/green/blue/alpha value per pixel, so four bytes per pixel.

    1920 * 1080 * 4 bytes = 8294400 bytes

So at 1 byte per character, and an average of 5.1 characters per word (quickie Google search with no further digging) with a space to separate them, that's about 1.35 million words. If we drop the non-essential alpha channel that brings us in very close to 1 million words for a raw 1920 * 1080 RGB image.

You could fit the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Hobbit and the Simarillion in there and have about two hundred thousand words left over.

However, images are usually compressed to a fraction of that size for storage, meaning they take up much less space. The size depends on the complexity of the image itself. 

The calculation is also very sensitive to your chosen average word size, and we're assuming the text is 8-bit ASCII (in reality you can get away with 7-bit ASCII for English texts, or even 5-bits per character if you drop the concept of capital letters, numeric digits, and just allow yourself 6 special characters).

379,"Ok, TIFU I guess. Time to get it off my chest.

Growing up we had a friend we called Bert. He was a big lanky and skinny dude, pale as a ghost due to his low blood pressure, prone to bouts of narcolepsy. Bert wasn't his real name, just a nickname that had stuck--it was short for Sherbet (pronounced *Sherbert* here), because he would foam at the mouth during his narcoleptic spells. In other words, he was a fantastic source of entertainment for our idiot troupe, and pranking Bert became part of our weekend routine.

He would drift to sleep during the slightest lull in action--sitting still more than ten minutes, basically. The only way he could stay awake was by keeping occupied, so he would walk around a lot, or keep himself busy eating (jerky was his favorite). When he slept he had two modes: he would either nod off and jerk back into consciousness a split second later (no good for pranking), or he would be *out cold* for maybe five minutes (perfect for pranking). You could tell he was out cold when he drooled.

One day we're playing Fifa '97 at another friend's house. I don't know if you remember Fifa '97 for the PS1 but the loading times were atrocious. After a while we looked over and Bert was slumped into himself, drool pooling in the folds of his coat (he rarely removed his big Manchester United manager's coat). We all agreed that Bert was due a pranking.

We knew we could move Bert around while he slept--an arm here, a leg there. But we'd never fully tested the limits of his tolerance. Two of us took an arm each and another guy took his legs and we lifted him from his chair. Sure enough he remained asleep. We swung him back and forth a bit and still he slumbered. We were amazed. 

So of course we knew the thing to do would be to carry him upstairs to our friend's sister's bedroom. At first we just wanted him to wake up somewhere weird. Then *we* got weird. Our friend's sister was about four years older than us, something of a hottie, and she worked odd shifts at the local supermarket. We'll call her Jane for the purposes of this retelling, it's close enough. It was mid-evening and we didn't know when exactly Jane would be home, which lent a frisson of terror to the process of undressing Bert.

After we'd stripped him down to his underwear, we slipped him under Jane's big baby-pink quilt and took his clothes downstairs. This should have been enough for us, but the madness had taken us and we knew we were going to push it as far as we could. We took one of Jane's fragrant girly pillows and put a bra and a pair of panties on it, then slipped it under Bert's naked arm.

We skulked back downstairs stifling laughter, waiting for Bert to wake and flee from the room in terror. Five minutes passed, then ten. Usually he would be awake by then. Maybe the comfort of the bed had lulled him into a deeper sleep...

We went up to check on him, and found him in much the same position as we had left him, except now he had an obvious erection that had escaped from the front of his boxers and he had *just had a very messy wet dream* all over Jane's sheets and pillow. It had darkened an expanding area of the crotch of her panties.

One of the most grim experiences of my life was trying to mop up Bert's cum with a bundle of kitchen paper on the end of a pair of barbecue tongs. We tried to wake him but it was no good, and that awful pale thing of his refused to deflate. Apparently he had no blood pressure problems *in one specific area*. Then we hear keys in the front door and *holy shit Jane is home*. 

I'm ashamed to say that I thundered down the stairs and ran out the back door and vaulted over the fence with an athleticism I never knew I had, closely followed by friend number 4, leaving our other friend to deal with Bert, his sister, the panties, and the cummy tongs. 

That was a shitshow.

384,"When she explains the Great Link to Odo, she says something like ""the drop becomes the ocean...and when it's time to leave, the ocean becomes the drop"". That gave me the impression that individuals in the sense we are familiar with don't really exist in the Great Link--it's not a sea of conversations between peers. When it's time to split off a chunk of the Great Link to perform a specific task, it's more like you or I telling a limb to perform an action.

Of course I don't know and it's just the impression I got from DS9.

But then again, Odo and the female changeling linked a few times, and re-emerged with their individuality intact...they did not split into new cocktails of each other in various measures...

I think it's undeniable that the changeling just enacted the _will_ of the Great Link. Was the brutality she displayed a trait of her individual consciousness (and thus easy to isolate in a Starfleet cell) or was she a balanced and representative personification of the Great Link as a whole?

If she was _not_ a balanced personification of the Great Link, why would she be allowed such complete control of the Dominion forces, untempered by other individuals holding dissenting opinions? It would make more sense for the Great Link to split off a Minor Link made of a handful of different individuals to perform the task.

This squirrel is pregnant, and the owner is trying to induce an abortion by running her belly under cold water. This will often kill the foetuses (just a few degrees for a sustained period of time us enough) and it will sometimes induce labour then and there. This does not harm the mother as squirrels have what we call 'skittish wombs' designed to abort a pregnancy if the mother is exposed to stress.

This is usually done when a pet squirrel has been impregnated by a wild buck and the pups are not desired.

P.S. this is not a procedure that we would recommend owners perform at home due to the potential for complications. Just bring your squirrel into the vet and ask for cold evacuation. It literally takes 20 minutes and you don't have any unpleasant cleanup.

395,"That's the core inconsistency. The models can't exist together without a lot of hand-waving. 

Either there's one universe where all time travel is just part of a 4D weave of cause and effect (and parallel universes are _something else altogether_) or there's a branching multiverse where a ship full of bombs leaving the year 2990 to blow up your dad in 1970 simply disappears forever with no possible effect on the originating universe, and the crew of the departing ship experience a new universe.

In either model I would find it hard to argue for funding for a temporal police force. The universe we are experiencing is immutable. A bomb sent back in time to destroy the primordial soup on Earth will either spawn a new universe with a sterile Earth OR warm the soup in just the right way to create life. Either way everyone can just relax and drink piña coladas, no timeships necessary. 

However, there _is_ a group intent on shaping time by allowing or disallowing certain temporal incursions. They must have some measurable effect. That suggests to me that changes in the past change a single, authoritative version of the present. They allow The Voyage Home. They allow the events of First Contact, which leads to the formation of the Federation. They (apparently) allow Janeway to bring Voyager home early, which presumably leads to the future survival of the Federation by crippling the Borg. All fine so far. But then they allow the events of ST09...an event which creates a history incompatible with theirs...unless the Kelvin universe somehow wraps back into the Prime timeline by undoing itself later!

1) Time travel in the Trek universe spawns parallel universes. The old timeline and new timeline coexist.

2) There is only one universe and time travel alters it. Temporal incursions endanger history.

If 1 is true, why bother trying to police time? Your timeline is alteration-proof. All you can do is stop (or hinder) the production of new universes that can't effect you in any way. But we _know_ that the future Federation works hard to protect its history.

If 2 is true, the future Federation of the Prime timeline should have protected their timeline against such a massive change. Surely they had the power to detect and prevent the Narada's journey (if we allow that they had that capability at all, though it is established pretty well in Voyager.)

399,"Guardianship of history is apparently critical for any civilization that survives long enough to advance to the stage of technological mastery over time. Suddenly history is not set in stone and the entire civilization could be erased by a single rogue actor with a time machine. Who knows how many versions of human history have been spawned and undone by tinkering from the mid to late 3rd millennium? But we know that at least one version of human history (through cooperation with other species through the Federation) is eventually able to establish its own time police and guard its own timeline. That instantly made that version of history a little less prone to being undone, which made it more inevitable than all the others...making the Federation itself an inevitability, or at least a historical low-energy state that is less prone to changing.

That means that in the Trek universe, time governance _must_ be an eventual trait of a successful civilization. _The Federation only exists because it is big enough and clever enough to eventually employ time agents to protect it._ Any version of the Federation that shied away from time travel was doomed to non-existence as neighbouring potentialities (other Federations and non-Federation civilizations caused by alterations to time) vied for the same space/time real estate.

I like the idea of large-scale defenses against alterations to the timeline...presumably something like that could be used to write time travel out of the Trek universe for good, or make it much more difficult.

A buffer of at least one month's pay will give you some flexibility and peace of mind--I would avoid anything non-essential until that was in place. Then _never use it._ 

Avoid borrowing money that you can't afford to pay back (do what you can to avoid increasing credit card debt). Especially avoid predatory lenders. I have a credit card that I use for convenience or emergencies and then pay off immediately (this makes me a deadbeat in credit card parlance). Be a deadbeat credit card owner.

Many expenditures are non-essential. Essentials are food, clothing, electricity, heating, and a roof over your head. Your own transport may be a necessity in some places, so buy a reliable car that doesn't require constant maintenance (think mid-2000s Japanese with about 100K miles).

Avoid pay-as-you-go services like electricity. Fight the bastards tooth and nail. I have an electricity meter that a guy has to come and read.

425,"Quasi-reality TV like The Only Way Is Essex is an interesting case as usually all the 'storytelling' is done through editing and the actor's only job is to moan about haircuts/make faces/say inane shit. There's no actual storytelling for the actors to accomplish, very little body movement, just sitting around and chatting face-to-face. Most people can have pretend conversations under those conditions as long as they learn to ignore the camera. It only seems 'realistic' because people are accustomed to how reality TV looks and sounds. To anyone who has not _bought into the reality of the show_ it's obviously bullshit.

Reality TV actors will ad-lib a situation once or twice based on an outline for a scene, then film it for the show. Usually the show will follow a rough structure, though probably not what you would call a script.

I woke up in a state of absolute panic, heart pounding, with an unwelcome hardon stress-testing the stitching of my jeans.

Any of those levels could be attacked by some self-replicating agent, even if it didn't look like a traditional virus. The substrate appears to be able to renew itself, probably through a process we could compare to cellular mitosis, even though they are probably not made up of cells in the way we would understand. It is likely that this process was the chosen attack vector for the virus. 

We know that viruses can insinuate their RNA into their host permanently--parts of the human genome are made up of chunks of virus that ended up in the transcription mechanism. Something similar might be designed to alter the Founder substrate at a fundamental level, so even after a transformation into burning plasma the virus code is still built into whatever encodes the structure of their bodies. The virus could then hijack the shapeshifting ability to create fresh 'traditional' virus bodies to infect more and more of the substrate--like an old-school computer virus that could infect a floppy disk boot record, but also copy a version of itself to Word documents, and jump from disk to document and back again.

What would a reunified Vulcan/Romulan empire look like? What is the ratio of Vulcan to Romulan population/systems/ships in the mid 21st century?

I feel like the Vulcanoid Empire would have ridden roughshod over human culture. We would have seen humans adopting Vulcan/Romulan customs in order to progress. The people in power in our sector would be Romulans or half-Romulans.

It would take a major (successful) revolt in order for the Terrans to be respected as equals.

His only limits would be psychological, but his mind is pliable, so he could choose to remove or alter the subroutines that cause ennui. 

The Doctor could live _at least_ until the collapse of the Federation and the rich technological civilisation it supports. After that, he could live for as long as he can salvage or replicate compatible emitter parts. Assuming warp-capable civilisations are a permanent feature of the galaxy, he could hop from one civilisation to another as the centuries go on, introducing them to hologram technology (and medical technology), inspiring new Federation-like cultures, and supporting himself that way. This could go on until the galaxy can no longer support intelligent life. After that, who knows. I imagine the last civilisations of the burnt-out Milky Way will be fairly advanced and able to move elsewhere (another galaxy, or another dimension).

Perhaps the collapse of the Federation will lead to a diaspora of holographic beings and androids, and they may not be welcome everywhere. I see that as the only real threat to the Doctor--he could be rejected or hunted by the Federation's future neighbours. But he could easily take a tiny shuttle (or a very very tiny and efficient craft designed for holographic beings) and hide in interstellar space for centuries at a time, waiting out the threat.

Would the Doctor ever _choose to die_? I think the Doctor would interpret a suicidal urge as an illness, and choose to fix himself instead. The Doctor will not be the only hologram to run into that wall--as the Federation fills with millennia-old holographic beings he will not be alone.

Remember too that the Doctor is not limited to a single instance of himself forever, so he has redundancy on his side.

460,"&gt; ""people who say they are religious are only lying so they have a place to hold big events"" is a pretty fucking insulting thing to insinuate.

This is not an insinuation--it's a plain old observation. But you've decided that I meant it as some scathing judgement upon the character of these folk. 

I think it would be _great_ if we had traditions surrounding birth/death/marriage that didn't involve sucking up to a priest first, but we don't, and some people--some great people!--can't bear the idea of getting married in a hotel, so the sucking up and fakery happens. It doesn't make them bad people. Just like buying a diamond ring doesn't make you bad or dumb, even though the diamond industry is clearly bad and dumb.

But they are not _religious_ in any sense of the word that involves a firm belief in the creator-God or the specific dogma of the Catholic Church. What I'm saying is _Ireland is a secular nation living with a hangover of Catholic tradition and it's weird and uncomfortable for most people involved._ There's a lot of barely-concealed bullshitting that goes on in the name of tradition.

No, you misquoted me there. I said that the current ratio of Church facilities to actual religious people is hard to fathom and probably unsustainable. I'm saying that when the generation born around the 1950's dies off--the generation of middle-aged genuflecters currently enforcing tradition with tut-tuts and eye-rolling in families across Ireland--then the numbers will correct themselves pretty quickly. The buildings will be even emptier than they are today. The church is _done_ when everybody's wee Catholic mammies die off. Chapels will need to rebrand themselves as event venues.

I'm not saying there will be no more true believers--there's one born every minute.

The Church (specifically the Catholic church, but probably all of them) has been misrepresenting the number of regular churchgoers for years in order to pretend that it's still relevant and worthy of consideration (e.g. when laws are revised about abortion, or marriage, or divorce, or the provisioning of schools, etc etc etc). Even people who would consider themselves Good Catholics are usually just Birth/Wedding/Funeral Catholics--people who need _somewhere nice to hold an event_. They say all the right things to the Priest, pretend they've had a sudden resurgence of faith, hold their event, then disappear. It's far more about tradition than religion. Just wait until all the 50's kids are dead. We'll have more coffeehouses in abandoned chapels than we know what to do with. (I live in a small city with nine chapels and a cathedral...and if you leave town in any direction you'll pass another chapel within 5 minutes. Yet I only know of one genuinely religious woman in my entire extended family circle and she's a nutbar. We are ripe for a correction.)

These 25,000 people in Norway weren't actual churchgoers anyway--this is just a downward correction of a bloated number. It comes across as pretty forward-thinking and honest of the Norwegian church to try and work with some real numbers instead of vanity metrics. Good for them.

You'd think having accurate numbers would be important if you actually thought your mission was to _literally save souls from damnation_, but the Catholic Church in Ireland stopped recording numbers of defections some years ago after a site called Count Me Out became popular and they lost a medium-sized town's worth of people from their tally. I've never seen anybody counting heads in mass or heard of Priests reaching out to lapsed parishioners. They're more than happy to bloat their headcount (_everybody_ in Ireland is either Catholic, Protestant or Other, right?) and exist as a weird tradition-with-benefits for as long as possible. But holy shit don't criticize them around the guilty Stockholm-syndromed fairweather Catholics of the last generation or you are in for a _tutting_ like you wouldn't believe.",2016-09-02 14:51:46+00:00,d76sye7,1.0,t3_50skth,15621.0,worldnews
463,"Exhausted after a long day of paying for new soldiers, you decide to join one last game of BF1 before bed.

You decide to try a flight specialization. You spawn near a vast grey Zeppelin. Oh boy oh boy! _This_ is what you paid the extra $4.99 for! You run towards the tether but the Zeppelin unhooks itself before you can reach it, puttering off in the direction of the action--somebody got to it first. As its huge shadow retreats from the grassy runway you spot an odd-looking biplane sitting unattended. It looks pretty flimsy, all canvas and twine, with a pusher propeller to the rear and a machine-gun in its nose. But okay, you think. A plane's a plane.

You get in and start it up. The uneven field and anemic acceleration mean that you barely get into the air before you hit the tree line, and you have an asshole-clenching moment as you hear the rush of leaves whipping your landing gear. But you're off, and nothing seems to be on fire! You climb slowly and turn in the direction of the far-off pop of guns, following your teammates in their Zeppelin. 

You pull a few long maneuvers to get a feel for the craft. It flies like a brick powered by farts with a couple of ragged old pigeon feathers for wings. It's clearly a recon aircraft, a thing meant to fly in straight lines with a few gentle turns in between. You fire the gun to test it out and the resulting deceleration throws you into a stall. As you pull up from the death-dive you punch through a small fluffy cloud, which blinds you and nearly tears your wings off. You lose your scarf. When you wipe the mist from your goggles you see something like a ribbed grey wall about fifty yards ahead. You pull back hard on the stick. Something twangs between your feet and the stick goes loose.

The kill cam shows you punching through the Zeppelin and emerging as a tangled meteor of burning wood and metal on the other side. A half-second later the expanding wake of hydrogen-fueled hellfire catches up with you and your craft becomes nothing but sparks and ash.

Your team cuss you out pretty badly.

465,"You join a game of BF1. 

You decide to roll a female character to see if they play any differently.

You spawn in the combined living room/kitchen/bedroom of your damp tenement in Birmingham, England, surrounded by your nine gaunt-faced children. You hear a knock at the door.

You open the door to a grim man in a soaked overcoat. He doffs his hat, then hands you a letter and a small box containing something that looks like a penny. The medal looks tarnished already, and the impression of Britannia and her Lion has been franked off-center. The man asks your permission to read the letter aloud, and you agree, but his words are just a mumble and you hear nothing but your own heart pounding in your chest. 

When the man leaves, your children are gathered behind you. The eldest seem to understand enough to weep; the youngest look confused. ""Was it about dad? When's dad coming home?""

""E's not coming home isse? E's facking dead innie? Facking kraat took the top of 'is 'ed clean off!"" You don't know why you're shouting in a London accent but you guess the voiceover woman couldn't do a convincing Brummie. You press the melee button to slap the nearest child.

This time you are lucky and spawn next to an unoccupied tank. Alright, let's do this! 

You climb into the tank and familiarize yourself with the controls, and before long you are chugging along nicely in the general direction of the smoke and explosions. The edges of your screen blur and you are alerted to a gradual health drain from diesel fumes escaping into the cabin, so you light a cigarette and use it as a filter.

Through the viewing-slit you see a narrow road with a ditch at either side. You turn to drive down it, but the mud gives way beneath the right treads and the tank topples on its side with a metal groan. The engine continues to grumble and you hear the crackle of flame. 

You attempt to leave the tank but the hatch has buckled. The flames spread out from the engine block and into the cabin. You howl as your skin reddens and crinkles in the heat, and the edges of your screen darken. 

You hear a clanging from outside the tank. Thank god, a friendly engineer! He manages to open the hatch a crack with his crowbar and you press the melee button to kick it from the inside. As the hatch opens you hear an unsettling hiss from behind you. 

The killcam shows the magazine igniting, turning the upturned tank into a perfect Newtonian killbox as a hail of finger-sized bullets shreds you from every direction. A stray bullet takes out the helpful engineer as well, opening his neck just above his collarbone.

You start up to your ankles in an oily mixture of piss and French mud. The trench is eerily silent.

You pass a bloated boy staring wide-eyed at the blank grey sky and your character realistically waves the flies aside. (You skip the option to loot his loadout.) After a while you see an officer and three men ahead. Great, you think. A squad I can join! 

The officer pulls out a pistol and shoots one of the men in the head, splattering his brains over your screen. A message appears explaining that he had refused to go over the top, and now his account is permabanned.

The officer blows his whistle and you run to a ladder with the two remaining players. You catch a two-second glimpse of smoke and devastation before you fall backwards into the trench and your screen goes black. The kill cam shows a rifleman blowing your jaw off with a lucky shot from a hundred yards away before a stray machine-gun bullet (from his own side, the machine gun fires in a 90-degree spread) rips his arm off at the shoulder.

You should hopefully see your memory usage creep upwards then level out over time. That means it's not a memory leak, it's just ruby doing its thing.",2016-07-29 14:19:29+00:00,d5vw9vl,1.0,t3_4v6isb,3629.0,rails

They have made _choices_ under _careful direction_. It is meant to be a brutal-looking bruiser of a ship.

Wait and see--six months from now you'll see the discarded concepts for this ship and they will all be different variations of 'ugly as hell'.

I hope this show is a window into a Trek universe of salvaged and re-purposed parts, ships built in a hurry under tough conditions to meet some terrible threat, systems that don't integrate properly, hacks left and right.

532,"This is what OAuth is for...look into it and see if the email providers support it.

Anything you invent here will be obfuscation, making it a little tougher to get hold of the passwords from a database dump, not much more than that. Ultimately the passwords will be handled as plaintext by your live application and that creates opportunities for leaks. Far better to never have their passwords in the first place.

Always assume that an attacker can get your entire DB. Always assume they can extract your environment variables. Always assume they can read your code.

That said...

If you must store encrypted passwords, at least have a randomised salt value associated with each record, and encrypt the password + salt instead of just the password. Then remove the salt after you decrypt. The random salt value means that an attacker with only your DB won't be able to work out the key by simply looking for repeated encrypted strings (e.g. without a salt, all the idiots with their password set to 'password' would have exactly the same value as their encrypted password).

I am no expert but I know roughly what to avoid... or what to be extremely cautious about... I really don't see how you could guarantee the safety of that data.

I would also suggest having a third party perform penetration testing on your live app (with only dummy data of course). At least you can make sure you have a strong front door (against common attacks at least)...but even then, the data is fundamentally insecure if _you the developer_ could extract it at any time.

Edit: here's a [good article](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/11/20/serious-security-how-to-store-your-users-passwords-safely/) that covers this. Seriously, you'd be better off reconsidering the approach altogether. Or make sure your terms and conditions cover your company's ass from every angle...

588,"8/10 Barrow Points

*Setting:* The surroundings are perpetually whipped by howling winds, and the snowbanks are home to a troll or two...that's always a plus in my book. However, the sallow-cheeked bandits that inhabit the nearby ruins and barrow entrance area made the barrow's setting feel less lonely, which is why I could not award Bleak Falls 10/10. The barrow is also easily accessible without a miles-long trek between forgotten peaks or swimming across the freezing ocean, so it loses another point.
 
*Barrow Bleakness:* The barrow itself boasts a fine variety of animate and inanimate skeletons clad in various amounts of desiccated flesh. Poses range from standing at attention, to seated pensively, to laying down. You'll find corpses that have lain undisturbed for two ages of Man, and they will be only too happy to rise from their imperfect slumber to carve you a new asshole! You may also run into large spiders and/or perilously enwebbed thieves. 

The barrow has a self-contained feel, lacking the variety that comes from intersecting with Dwemer ruins or Falmer hives. For me this kind of untouched isolation only adds to the bleakness, but your mileage may vary!

We felt we had to award bleakness points for the deadly traps that awaited the unsuspecting. Look out for those surprise floor switches and mind-bending cryptographic challenges involving eagles, fish and so on!

*Accommodation:* Don't expect to find too many bedrolls or fresh cabbages! No sir, this is no place for the living. That said, my wife and I felt the local potions had aged very well, so take the potion-tasting tour if a friendly Draugr offers!

591,"I think it's completely reasonable that human beings could re-boost Phobos in that time scale. We could do it with a few tiny rockets with century-long burn times, or mass-drivers, or a kilometer-sized bank of flippable mirrors to take advantage of photon pressure at just the right points of its orbit, etc etc.

Or, we'll pick it apart for resources in Mars orbit...transform Phobos and all its convenient kinetic energy into a ring of space stations. 

Phobos' chances of survival shot up as soon as the first smart ape sharpened a stick.

I might be completely wrong, but let me go hack around on Wolfram Alpha to work out how much orbital energy Phobos loses every century...and how much we'd need to impart to re-boost it...

**Edit:** okay, here's my attempt. Someone can probably show me where I'm wrong.

Current [specific orbital energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_orbital_energy) of Phobos, using gravitational parameter of Mars and a semi-major axis of 9378km = **-2.2839×10^6 J/kg**

Specific orbital energy Phobos would possess if we re-boosted it to increase its semi-major axis by 2km = **-2.283449×10^6 J/kg**

A difference of **451 joules** for every kilogram of Phobos, which would undo 100,000 years of orbital decay. 

But let's say we only want to undo the decay of 1 century--2 meters. That's 451 J/kg divided by 1000...**0.451 J/kg**. 

So every century, we need to impart at least **0.451 joules for every kilogram of Phobos** in order to arrest its decay.

0.451 J/Kg * mass of Phobos = 4.84x10^15 J...or the equivalent of **1.156 megatons of TNT**. Over a century, that seems doable!

That's 'merely' 0.021994 tons of TNT per second.

Or the energy equivalent of burning 0.69 gallons of gasoline every second.

Maybe I'm old-fashioned. But I feel like the need for impressive 3D environments and voiceovers have sapped the life out of the Final Fantasy series. You end up with empty cities with a few corridors to walk along, instead of villages and towns of lots of different flavours, full of things to discover. I much preferred the gorgeous pre-rendered backdrops and intimate little interactions of the PS1 era games, and I wish they would try something similar in glorious 4K...

(I guess I should just make that shit myself if I really want it.)

I'm definitely looking forward to FFXV and I'm willing to give it a real chance. But I feel like the economics of making FF games has killed their momentum...and somewhere between their ambition and the reality of the task they just fall short. The FFXIII era was a farce.

If I was Square Enix I would consider making at least quasi-fixed-perspective backgrounds for their eventual FFVII remake...simply so they can make more locations...and dropping the voiceover requirement altogether.

Even then--when you take into account historical drama, crime drama, war drama--it's all about men with females in secondary roles, or the occasional important woman. Because that's what history/crime/war is traditionally like! That's not simply the result of some male-dominated cultural lens. Yeah, the population was always 50:50, but nobody's going to watch dramas about 13th century washer women. Well--now that I write it out loud--that might be pretty cool. 

Not all TV and movies can be about 21st century CEOs and STEM graduates (female or otherwise). The balance of today's workplace only matters if you're making a contempary work. Even then, there's a spectrum of companies between 'male dominated' or '50:50 split'.

656,"If I'm getting my drunk on, my cutoff is where I feel I'll only have a mild 1-2 hour hangover. The greatest skill you'll ever learn is walking away from that last drink. When I drink it's usually either a small amount quickly (spirits usually) or a large amount slowly (beers over an 8-hour period say). When the buzz peaks and fades I'll end up sitting through the hangover and reading Reddit or playing mindless video games to get it over with before going to bed--I hate going to bed drunk. In these dark hours I feel mildly unwell and in no fit state for conversation but not depressed in the traditional sense. 

I've had plenty of all-day nightmare hangovers but I'm usually just angry at myself for drinking to the point of self-destruction, and embarrassed by any tomfoolery I got up to. And, to answer your question, it doesn't last more than a day. Maybe a mild shakiness on a Sunday morning if I nudged into 'alcohol poisoning' territory on a Friday night, gone by the afternoon. No major depressive episode.

Alcohol affects people differently. I probably have a 'normal' psyche. I have no shortage of existential malaise, occasional very bad days, but I don't drink if I'm feeling down--that's not a feeling I want to pursue. When I do drink, if I start out feeling ok, I end up feeling happy/excited/loose. 

Could it be down to what you're drinking? I usually drink whiskey/beer/cider with no ill effects. Vodka is fine, but it's easy to drink too much. Tequila and brandy give me the worst hangovers. And fuck wine altogether. Consider staying away from the red bull mixers (I allow myself one energy drink to get pepped up if I'm going out...no more than that...)

686,"Very simple. We made a Doomsday Clock for the military recently but there are civilian models as well.

Are you aware of quantum entanglement? How two photons can behave like one? Well, [it works retroactively](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrocausality). If you send photon A down a very long tube and send photon B immediately to a detector, you can detect what happens to photon A a nanosecond or so 'in the future.'

To make a Doomsday Clock you need to slow down photon A so it takes a useful amount of time to travel along its tunnel. To do this, we use 1.2 miles of [Bose-Einstein condensate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose%E2%80%93Einstein_condensate). It's basically a slow-light gas! It takes about nine hours for photon A to get to the end of the tube, so when we take our measurement of photon B, we get to peek nine hours into the future. We don't just send one photon--we send a constant stream.

But what can this tell us? We can't use it to send a message back in time, because we end up with a garbled message from an infinity of parallel universes. But we can tell if the condensate is collapsed prematurely in most futures! In our military model, we keep the tube above ground near an important missile base. If the base is attacked or the BEC is otherwise disrupted in a majority of possible futures, we see a clear signal. 

The universe is constantly bubbling with possibilities. There's always a non-zero destruction signal. in fact it's quite significant! It was terrifying to learn that about three quarters of all nine-hour future timespans end in destruction. We call this baseline signal 'quarter to midnight'. When this spikes (usually when the superpowers tussle, but occasionally when we see very low of very high solar activity), we move the hand towards midnight. 

But don't worry! It can never reach midnight in any universe that you survive to observe!",2016-06-10 12:04:19+00:00,d43itse,1.0,t3_4ne8zv,34954.0,explainlikeimfive

710,"_Hundreds of billions of dollars?_ Even with a high estimate of the cost of a mission, you are off by an order of magnitude. But even if the cost was a hundred billion dollars, it's not like Elon Musk has to write a $100,000,000,000 check some Tuesday. It's spread over decades of work, all while the company is making serious bank from launches. The advancements they make for their Mars program end up making them money in private satellite launches and public-sector missions to the Moon and beyond. 

Read up on the [Falcon Heavy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_Heavy#Pricing_and_development_funding). The economics of space are changing rapidly. Getting a suitable craft into Earth orbit (maybe in a couple of launches) at a low cost is essentially a solved problem.

Look at the proposed costs of the [Red Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dragon_%28spacecraft%29) mission. All in the whole thing is about six hundred million dollars for a Mars mission that tests the Martian landing capability of the Dragon capsule, and performs useful science. 

They're discussing a sample return mission based on a similar idea. With a sample return mission you need an ascent vehicle and something to transfer the sample back to Earth, so that'll be new, and because it's new and bespoke/not reusable it's probably expensive. But it's a Mars sample return mission! Even if you ended up with two launches--one to send the lander/ascent vehicle and another to send the return vehicle, and they cost a billion dollars each...well, that's still not a hundred billion dollars. But for that we get a few kilograms of fresh Martian dirt.

Once you know how to land a capsule on Mars, you're halfway to a manned mission. Once you know how to get a person from the surface back to Mars orbit and rendezvous with a return vehicle (even if you're going from Mars surface to Mars orbit it in a two-foot-diameter tube on the end of a lightweight single-stage rocket made out of Dragon parts burning locally-sourced methane), you can build a manned Mars mission. 

I can't say what plans he has for the Mars craft itself--and I doubt it would be ready in 8 short years. I'd say we'd would be much more likely to see a manned Phobos mission in that timeframe, or a mission to some near-Earth asteroid, to shake out the technologies and do some useful science.

792,"Your point about 'keeping your apoapsis about 30 seconds ahead of you' is a very easy way to perform a good gravity turn, and it's often missed in discussions of gravity turns (in favor of a prescribed set of altitudes and angles). I personally use a 40 second rule (after turning slowly from 1km so that I'm burning horizontal by 30,000 meters, or slightly higher depending on the craft). It takes just the tiniest amount of constant thrust and managing your attitude by a few degrees up or down from the horizontal to keep it there while your apoapsis and periapsis gradually grow. In my experience there will come a point where AP/PE are both about 48,000-50,000 meters and it becomes near impossible to keep AP 40 seconds away (you've essentially got a circular in-atmosphere orbit), at this point I just burn a little harder to raise my AP to my desired final height and drift up there (because I lack the saintly patience to wait any longer). It's usually a tiny burn at AP to circularize anyhow, so I'm only wasting 30 m/s or so.

Edit: cool thing about this is you can rely on a sustainer strategy with an engine that gives you a &lt; 1.0 TWR as soon as you are into the 'keeping apoapsis at 40s' regime of your ascent, where you might not have the time to circularize with the same engine if you just lofted your craft to 75km using the traditional strategy and burned at AP. The Poodle isn't great at sea level but once you're in that 30-40km range it has a fair portion of its vacuum thrust available...and if you're carrying a Poodle to space anyway (to get to Duna, the Mun, etc) it's better to use it here and accept it won't be maximally fuel-efficient for this portion of the flight.

835,"Hey, I thought your craft looked fine, so I built a replica to test it out (I needed some new-career science anyway). As expected, [it flew fine!](http://imgur.com/a/xuDIv)

I'm assuming that's a Swivel engine pictured--I think it is. The swivel engine is able to 'gimbal', which means the angle of thrust can be changed (and the rocket can be steered during ascent, correcting for any deviations from your optimal flight path). Without engine gimbal, there is no other form of attitude control on this simple ship (those fins are for aerodynamic stability, not steering). The capsule has a weak reaction wheel, but this is not enough to steer effectively during ascent. 

I have pressed T to turn stability assistance on. This is vital! This means that the craft will automatically try to keep the same heading, using the engine to correct itself if it should drift. Be warned, SAS and engine gimbal can cause crafts to shake themselves to death, so sometimes turning the gimbal amount down to 15 or 20% is all that is necessary.

The craft has a very high TWR (Thrust to Weight Ratio). This means that it will accelerate very quickly if you use maximum thrust. High velocity travel in the lower atmosphere means a lot of atmospheric stress--so the tiniest steering deviation will throw you into a spin. So as you can see in my pictures, I flew with the thrust set to about 50%. Use left-shift and left-ctrl to raise and lower the thrust (as opposed to Z and X, which mean 'full thrust' and 'no thrust'). Adding another couple of tanks to the stack would reduce your TWR to a more manageable amount, and give you the fuel to escape the atmosphere (though not enough to orbit).",2016-04-20 16:33:53+00:00,d2ahost,1.0,t3_4fnytn,2815.0,KerbalSpaceProgram

858,"Think of a life-bearing planet as a system that produces useful work. Life uses solar/geothermal/chemical energy to locally reduce entropy, turning dumb rocks into more living things--and as a side-effect, iPads and airplane engines and so on. Right now Earth is a self-contained system--we're not making anything for off-worlders. Our focus is on creating more living stuff, not space-widgets. Think about what would change if the continuation of life on Earth was a secondary priority. (Hint: everything starts to look like a smog-choked industrial city in China, where life _is_ a secondary priority and economic slaves make things for Western aliens).

An advanced alien species would have better ways to produce their vital space widgets than enslaving the local apes. There are more efficient ways to burn through the available matter in Earth's crust (although we're doing a _decent_ job. We call optimal stripmine-to-landfill  processing a 'strong economy'). 

I think an alien invasion would look like a solar-powered grey goo scenario. Maybe a few grams of nanomachines arrive in our upper atmosphere ahead of some kind of harvester. The machines land, reproduce themselves, and reorganise Earth's crust into alien iPad batteries and rocket fuel and launch as much as possible into LEO for the harvester (when it arrives in 100, 1000, 10000 years) to simply scoop up. The goo absorbs and ignores us. Maybe our biomass is useful for methane production. It will be inhuman and unstoppable.

I'd imagine the whole system would be transformed, not just Earth. Every solid body would become part of a solar-powered alien factory. Maybe the factory would build its own solar sails to send the produce homeward and send new factory spores to nearby systems. No hand-waving sci-fi magic is necessary here--just realistic physics, economics, and lots of time.

Unless enslavement itself was the aim--perhaps the aliens arrive and they have some reason for enslaving sentient species (especially a race of violent predators like Homo Sapiens), even if they throw away the product of our labor. Maybe it's more morally acceptable than simply killing us all. Maybe the art we produce is worth something to them. Maybe the drama of the lives we lead.

931,"I'm going to assume this is a non-April-1st idea...

Is this being proposed as a solution to the Fermi paradox? Does it suggest that ET is actively hiding from us (and from each other?) 

E.g. 

- Let's say we find microbes on Mars or Europa (so we can say 'life is common')
- At some point, we'll be able to safely declare that the galaxy is _conspicuously empty_...
- we know how we might hide. So, they are probably hiding from us using similar means.
- if we deduce that civilisations are actively hiding from each other, then it would stand to reason that we should hide too, that it should be our highest priority, that there's something out there worth hiding from--even if we don't know what that is! 

The original 'galactic threat' could have been extinct for millions of years but the galactic vow of silence would continue indefinitely as each new intelligent species makes the same deduction from their own SETI observations. The silence would perpetuate itself. 

(Also, we should be terrified.)

But then again...

- if the cloaking beams are only energetically practical when focused on your neighbourhood of stars...then they become worse than useless when opposing civilisations can send telescopes into interstellar space, outside the range of the beam. 
- Now the absence of your cloaking beam (and sudden appearance of your world or whatever else you were hiding when the new data is diff'd with records) is a beacon signalling the existence of intelligent life in your system. This is arguably worse than just not hiding at all. ",2016-04-01 22:28:00+00:00,d1mcvtk,1.0,t3_4csjn2,84750.0,SETI

980,"- Choose your periapsis wisely. Too low and you may burn up (well, that's hard to do in stock...but let's pretend). Too high and the effect will be minimal, which can lead to an hour of time warp -&gt; aerobrake -&gt; time warp -&gt; aerobrake before you dip under 50km or so and finally land. 

- Heatshields come with a huge excess of ablator. You can reduce the amount in the VAB to cut weight. If you're returning from LKO, the Mun, or Minmus, you need very little. Returns from Duna and Eve also don't require much.

- Make sure your craft is aerodynamically balanced so that the heatshield will naturally face in the right direction when you enter an atmosphere. A shape like the classic [sphere-cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry#Sphere-cone) will balance all by itself. A couple of fins on the other end of the ship can help. Or make sure you have RCS capability and keep the heatshield pointed in the right direction using SAS.

- Learn about ballistic coefficients. A light craft with a big surface area facing the direction of travel will aerobrake far more effectively than a heavy craft with a small surface area. I've done crazy Laythe aerobrakes where I ram into Laythe on an impact trajectory with a massive velocity difference (a direct shot to Laythe from Kerbin), but my Kerbonaut's lander was just an external seat with a battery and some parachutes behind a 2m heatshield. Apart from pulling about 60Gs he was absolutely fine, and was slow enough for parachutes long before splashdown.

- With light enough probes you can often get away without a heatshield if you rotate in the atmosphere to distribute the heating evenly across your parts. Some parts take punishment better than others!

- With the right periapsis (and a low-energy transfer) you can aerobrake into an orbit around any body with an atmosphere. This is called an aerocapture and it feels pretty good. The line between a hyperbolic orbit, an aerocapture, and an unintentional landing can be a matter of km, so F5-F9 and try a bunch of heights. You can augment your aerocapture by burning your engines at periapsis. Just remember to raise your periapsis out of the atmosphere when you're at apoapsis, or raise it just a little higher in the atmosphere to aerobrake into a tighter orbit. This works best when your velocity relative to the planet is at its lowest possible. If you're approaching the planet at some crazy relative velocity (let's say you chose a non-optimal transfer and just spent lots of dV to get an encounter) then you need to burn off all that velocity in the atmosphere somehow, and ultimately that will come in the form of heat you'll need to deal with (with your ablator, then parts of your ship...). In these cases it may not be possible to survive the heating and also reduce your velocity sufficiently in a single pass (you'd need to go very low into the atmosphere while still traveling at a high relative velocity, and that means lots of heat).

- You can repeatedly aerobrake during hyperbolic passes of Eve to lower your Kerbol orbit and lower the fuel requirement for an encounter with Moho. 
 
- 'Lifting entry' actually works--this is where the angle of attack of your heatshield or the underbelly of an SSTO generates some lift. This is useful if you want to burn off velocity without plunging into the deepest parts of an atmosphere too soon--it reduces the max temp your craft experiences, and Gs that your crew experience. Not really a concern in stock.

- If I understand correctly there's a big inflatable heatshield coming in 1.1 that should help with the ballistic coefficient woes of larger craft. But as I said in a comment below, I've had some success with mounting a number of 1.5m heatshields on infernal robotics arms, then extending them to increase my windward area and aid with an aerocapture.

You use something like Transfer Planner to get a rough idea of when you need to leave the system (e.g Earth-Moon to Mars). You'll also have an idea of the ejection angle you're going for. You'll need to time your burn from Earth orbit so that the moon, when you encounter it, is in a position to accelerate you out of the system at the correct angle. You can tune your lunar encounter to give you a range of ejection angles, but for max efficiency you also want to get as close as possible, so you need to work out some optimum encounter time + lunar periapsis. I just do this by tinkering with nodes. 

Using a tool like Precise Node with maxed out conic predictions will give you a better idea of where you'll be headed after your encounter.

1048,"I feel like working out how far a sixteen pound bowling ball could go under various conditions (moon size, moon density, ice smoothness). 

The ball needs to overcome the friction of the ice surface under gravity (so it slides at all), but if you throw it too hard it will lift off the surface of the moon on an orbital/suborbital path. Technically if you had a perfectly smooth equatorial road and a moon with no variations in density in an otherwise empty universe you could cause the ball to orbit indefinitely a micron or so above the road surface, so that can't be allowed. 

So for each of these perfect simulated moons, there's a maximum force with which you can throw the ball, so a maximum distance the ball will slide. For some set of moon params (small enough circumference but dense enough that the ball doesn't drift off, but also not so dense that the friction is crazy high) the ball would be able to go all the way around the moon. Maybe that's a kilometer-wide moon with the gravity of Earth, I don't know yet. Then we'd need to work out if an object of that size and density could possibly exist, and if it could, we'd need to work out if a standard bowling ball would be torn apart by extreme tidal forces.

Also, balls don't just slide, some of the friction would be transferred to angular momentum and the ball would start to roll. A rolling ball will go further than a magical non-rolling ball of the same material and mass--some portion of the friction becomes angular momentum instead of slowing the ball, and then that angular momentum will be useful later when the ball slows enough that the rolling of the ball translates to forward momentum. A ball roll is a complex thing. (Probably simple for people who work these things out for a living though, and I bet there's a simple model we can look up).",2016-03-02 19:27:06+00:00,d0l241s,4.0,t1_d0kvd71,8965.0,mildlyinteresting

1077,"It does sound like it would be a badass movie. CRUSHING DISTANCE. Here's how I see it going:

Wong Pei is the congenitally deaf nephew of Chen Zei Long, head of the Tumbling Mountain Kung Fu school. Wong Pei is played by a young Jackie Chan. 

Backstory: Wong Pei is an orphan, taken in as an infant by his kindly aunt, also deaf. This is important to the plot.

We open fifteen years ago. A large house on a grassy Chinese mountainside. Chen Zei practices his Tumbling Mountain style among some billowing sheets that his wife (Wong Pei's aunt) has left out to dry. He attempts to perfect his secret Crushing Boulder Fist by shadow-boxing against the sheets, drying them instantly with the whip-crack of sonic booms. 

However, he does not see his wife and five-year-old Wong Pei walking together practising sign language behind a sheet, and he accidentally explodes his wife's ribcage all over the place. She is killed instantly and the sheets are ruined. 

Chen Zei blames Wong Pei. In the years that follow, his heart becomes hard as stone. He opens a successful school for his brutal Tumbling Mountain style. Their fame spreads through the region. He refuses to train Wong Pei--the boy becomes a janitor and cook for the school, much derided and abused by the other boys. 

Of course he watches everything and trains in secret, because he's Young Jackie Chan. After mastering the basics, he retreats daily to the forest to practise a secret technique he only saw a few times as a boy. Being deaf, he has no idea that his first successful Crushing Boulder Fist sends a clap of thunder echoing through the valley, which Chen Zei hears.

Chen Zei leaves the school to investigate the sonic boom. On his way to the forest, he is surrounded and set upon by a group of men of the Fire Wind school. When the gang are almost beaten, they use trickery (handfuls of gunpowder) to blind and then savagely beat Chen Zei, leaving him for dead in a forest clearing. Laughing and joking and setting off firecrackers, they continue to the village where they ransack the school and burn it to the ground.

Returning from his training, Wong Pei discovers Chen Zei's burned and broken form. Chen Zei holds Pei's fist in his hands and smiles, realising that the boy was somehow responsible for the sonic boom.

Other than that, have you considered [using your DB to store this configuration](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/179572/should-i-use-a-config-file-or-database-for-storing-business-rules)? That would be a simple change you could implement without much trouble. Cache the settings in your app so you're not hitting the DB with every request, but read the settings back from the DB if the last read was more than (for example) 15 minutes ago. That way you can propogate changes easily as long as it's not going to cause a problem if the settings are slightly out of date.

1133,"I've done this to rescue Kerbals returning from Duna with no fuel to adjust for an aerobrake. In my case their hyperbolic trajectory had them pass close to Kerbin (i.e. a 100km periapsis). My basic strategy was to launch to match their inclination, circularize to match their Kerbin periapsis, then burn hard at the right time to roughly match their local hyperbolic trajectory but going at 1.2x the speed.

You need to be fast. This is a job for brute force. Your rescue craft will need enough dV to catch up with your Kerbals before they escape Kerbin's SOI (e.g. it would theoretically exit Kerbin's SOI some hours before them) and then, when it catches them, it needs to slow down enough to match their speed, and then again to get some kind of a Kerbin orbit.

You find an intercept somewhere in the couple of days before they leave Kerbin's SOI (in my case they were almost beyond Minmus orbit before I caught them) and burn retrograde to match their speed when you get close. MechJeb won't be a lot of help here, except perhaps the 'intercept target at fixed time' function (but you'll need to roughly work out the time yourself)

Take your science and transfer your Kerbals, then burn retrograde with everything you have to lose all that velocity and get some kind of an orbit around Kerbin. (In my case, my first intercept craft wasn't enough--it just slowed them down enough that my second intercept craft could catch them before they left Kerbin's SOI!)

The intercept craft will possibly be a probe core, a full orange tank with a Poodle in LKO, and three command seats for the Kerbals. Nothing else except a couple of solar panels and minimal RCS. (You might try a claw instead of the command seats if you want to use the original pod for reentry, but you'll need to be very accurate with where you catch their pod to avoid an imbalanced craft.)

Then you relax and send another ship (with reentry capability) to intercept with that, and bring your guys home.",2016-02-12 17:17:57+00:00,czxhojv,1.0,t3_45dnp0,35590.0,KerbalSpaceProgram

This assumes you're going to aerobrake when you get back to Kerbin. I'd also multiply those numbers by 1.15 or so to account for bad piloting/imperfect transfers/last minute adjustments.

1154,"Here's what I would do:

- plan for an aerocapture around Kerbin. This means you an find an optimal transfer back to Kerbin using the tools described in this thread, and you don't need to concern yourself with the Mun. Also, an aerocapture will probably be fine. 

- once you're on your way to Kerbin, place a manoeuvre node at the quarter-way point and adjust the values to either get a lucky gravity assist from the Mun, or set your Kerbin periapsis to 35/40km or so.

- you want your return to the Kerbin system to have a low inclination if you want a useful gravity assist.

- you're looking for any Mun encounter where the Mun is between 7 and 9 if you are at 6 and Kerbin is the center of the clock. You want to pass close to the surface as the Mun is coming towards you on its orbit. 

- the Mun might also be able to 'catch' you on your way out of the system after you have passed Kerbin. I haven't tried.

- you can delay your arrival in the Kerbin system with a small radial burn followed by a matching anti-radial burn a day/a week later. The scope for delay without losing your encounter is small. 

- I'd just ignore Minmus for this unless others have had good experiences with it, I doubt even an optimal reverse gravity assist will do much for your velocity

- make sure you're not entering Kerbin's atmosphere against the direction of Kerbin's rotation (or you'll have another 300+ m/s to brake for) ",2016-02-04 13:23:56+00:00,cznhie4,1.0,t3_4429zh,53631.0,KerbalSpaceProgram

- The sepratron landing back on Kerbin seems to be the cheapest I can do so far. It's significantly lighter and cheaper than a parachute (with half the fuel removed)

- Slightly offsetting the payload atop the SRB _does_ make it turn in that direction. You only want to offset it about one pixel-width in the VAB.

Others in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/43s9zb/challenge_week_115_skinflint_vii_the_mun_and_back/czlma5n) are doing it for less. 

Now, I know this is not really the answer to your question, but you might see some inspiration in the mission logs. 

Check out the challenge thread to see other (e.g manned!) landings. Whatever you do the basic dV requirements are set in stone: get to LKO, then it's about 850 m/s to get a Mun flyby, another 250m/s to get a tight orbit, 550 m/s to land (+ losses due to gravity which you can minimise with fancy piloting), 550 m/s to get a minimal Munar orbit, and another 300m/s to leave Munar orbit and aerobrake around Kerbin. 2700 m/s if everything goes well. 3000m/s is a good target amount of dV to have in LKO. 

When you're landing on the Mun, try to get a ridiculously low orbit first (3km) and when you're over the plains start to kill your horizontal speed. The less time you spend battling gravity (e.g. burning with the engines pointed down) the more efficient your landing will be, so ideally you want to be about 200-500m above the surface as your orbital velocity approaches zero. In my best landing recently, the landscape came up to meet me as I approached zero orbital velocity. Caveat: you may need to spend a few m/s of dV to raise yourself over terrain features by burning somewhere between the retrograde and radial markers. It's exciting! 

Contrast this approach with a suicide burn after a straight fall on to the Munar surface from 5km. During the duration of the fall you will be accelerating toward the surface and you'll need to pay for that with fuel.",2016-02-03 13:16:27+00:00,czm76rx,1.0,t3_43yzhb,16535.0,KerbalSpaceProgram

1168,"I've really enjoyed the economic challenge of Week 115 (more bang for your bucks). I'd suggest a variation on the theme...

**More bang for your bucks II: more bangier**

Normal: Land on any body outside of the Kerbin system and return for a launch cost of less than 25,000 funds.

Hard: Land on any body outside of the Kerbin system and return for a launch cost of less than 12,500 funds. (Honestly I think we'll see numbers like 7,000 and less)

Super: A probe to Moho? A manned mission to Dres, or a Joolian moon?

I think there's plenty of scope here for crazy and inventive solutions. I was able to get a Mun lander with 4,000+m/s of dV in LKO for around $17,000, and the solution wasn't even all that refined...getting to Ike or Gilly should be possible with that. 

- If people would rather make refueling SSTOs then the 'launch cost' restriction could be dropped in favor of 'total cost', but I don't see how the challenge would be special compared to any normal refueling SSTO mission. I'm not saying that's easy at all, just a very different engineering challenge. (If someone can make an interplanetary SSTO for a launch cost of under 25,000 then, by all means, that's badass!)

- If 'land' is too tight a restriction, maybe 'return science from any body'. That opens up the possibility of returning cheap atmospheric science from Eve/Duna/Jool/Laythe if people are so inclined. I'd go by whatever the majority think would be most fun. Maybe lower the fund limits to 20,000/10,000 in this case.",2016-02-02 17:46:45+00:00,czl75ca,1.0,t3_3zv9ni,2265633.0,KerbalSpaceProgram

The Ant engines were just incapable of holding the apoapsis at 40 seconds away even in a near-vacuum. There's a tipping point where a low-thrust craft would need to be burning almost radially to keep the apoapsis up, adding very little orbital speed (and probably literally tipping over). The only way to get an orbit was to buy enough time to get up to orbital speed by launching the probe as high as possible. It had to add 1000m/s to get an orbit. The craft had to burn hard horizontally from 60km, all the way up to 125km, and all the way back down to about 75km before it was moving fast enough for the periapsis to raise out of the atmosphere.

The answer was: just $3,972 to put it on the launchpad, with a recovery value of $638! I think the only way I could cut more cost with this design would be to cut a few units of fuel, or start clipping things to an unacceptable level. Even switching to SRBs just ends up costing more for less control.

The biggest saving was the re-purposed Thud instead of a Swivel engine. This is a strategy I think I'll use again as it's perfect for launching this 'microprobe' size of craft.

- Install your proprietary video driver, configure (e.g. I had to tell nvidia-settings to force high performance mode)
- Install Steam
- Install KSP, set the launcher to use the 64-bit executable

1216,"Floating point is a way of representing rational numbers in a limited number of binary digits. Usually 32 or 64 bits. Bits after the point represent increasingly small fractions...1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16 etc. Any number that you can represent by adding together these fractions can be stored perfectly. However, try representing a number like 1/3 and you'll see that you can only have an approximation. 

For example, let's create an 8-bit floating point number. The 'point' is floating right in the middle. 

    1100.1101 = 12 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.0625 = 12.8125 

Great, but what if I want to represent 12.3333? Closest I can get is:

    1100.0101 = 12 + 0.25 + 0.0625 = 12.3125

So that's a floating point 'error'. In the real world, with more bits to play with, the error is much smaller, but compounded by successive mathematical operations. Let's try to add 1.3333 and 2.3333.

    0001.0101 + 0010.0101 = 0011.1010

...which is 3.625. However, 0011.1011 would be closer to the 3.6666 that we want. Too late, we've compounded the error. Our little ship in our 8-bit universe is vibrating all over the place.

The 'floating' part is the position of the decimal point in the number--you can have a large whole part and you lose precision after the decimal point, or you can have a small whole part and represent a more precise fraction. (My 8-bit example above is technically 'fixed point' because we decided where the point was up front. It would actually need to sacrifice more bits to store the position of the floating point!) Adding large and small numbers leads to situations like this:

    1.0000001 = 1.0078125

    1000000.1 = 64.5 

    1000000.1 + 1.0000001 = 1000001.1 = 65.5

Close, but we've truncated away the 0.0078125--another kind of floating point error. 

In the case of space simulations, you're working with numbers that need to be very large and very precise at the same time. So floating point is not ideal. On the other hand, floating point math is fast and usually good enough for games. The alternatives (using pairs of large integers for example) require slow and complicated custom mathematical operations implemented in software (read this memory location, add to the value in this memory location, add any overflow to this memory location, etc. etc.)",2016-01-24 14:38:11+00:00,cza0cpy,1.0,t3_42fyd5,2104.0,KerbalSpaceProgram

(I'm going to describe a launch with some rough ballpark figures for velocities and altitudes. None of these are exact.)

Now launch straight up with max thrust. At about 100m/s begin to turn very gently towards the east. You should see your prograde marker begin to move. Keep turning smoothly. By the time you reach 10,000m your craft should be angled at about 45 degrees to the surface. By the time you reach 35,000-40,000m you should be burning horizontal to the surface. If your gravity turn is smooth you will not tumble, even when you drop your first stage. 

Switch to the orbital view and keep burning until you apoapsis reaches about 80,000m. As soon as the apoapsis reaches 80,000m, cut your engines. You might only be at 50,000m or less at this point. Now coast until your ship reaches the 79,000m mark. 

Then with your nose pointed prograde, burn until your periapsis is above 75,000m. Now you have an orbit!

1251,"Something weird happened. 

I haven't played in a while, so I started a new career mode in 1.0.5 with a minimal set of mods. I built a basic craft, put Jeb in orbit, met the contract conditions, then turned the engines around at a random point in my near-circular orbit and burned to bring my periapsis down.

I plunged into the atmosphere and just focused on keeping my heat shield pointed the right way, nothing out of the ordinary. I watched my parachutes until it was time to deploy.

Then I saw something odd in the darkness below. Shapes. A few roads. A few buildings. Wait, I thought--is that the VAB?!?! 

I landed on one of the outer roads of the space center without trying! That's just where the parachutes took me. I've never been able to land at the space center accurately without landing guidance. And this one time I did it, it was entirely by accident. 

Did I just have the wildest luck?

Mostly I just wanted to tell someone about it...I'm going to take it as an omen that my 17th career will go well! ",2016-01-15 23:36:38+00:00,cyztnj0,1.0,t3_413oab,27271.0,KerbalSpaceProgram

1271,"(It's strange to talk about this stuff a full twenty years later. I have no idea what Franklin does now.)

The ritual continued to a point where I thought we were essentially done, no Bloody Mary appearance, game over. That's when Franklin stepped up his game. He stood from his cushion and his chant rose to a shout. The sound seemed to vibrate the darkness, if that makes any sense...I know it probably doesn't. I felt my humming start to weaken, like I was breathless, weakening while he grew more intense.

Then I was a ragdoll, falling back from my cushion, and the world was filled with a roar that seemed to come from somewhere within and outside me all at once. I forced my eyes open. Franklin had become a shifting shadow. I could see about half of the mirror and it seemed to glow. Franklin's voice came to me from very far away: ""keep humming! Keep humming!""

So I hummed in my altered state and the sound was like alpine horns in my ears. I saw something in the mirror; I can only describe it as a wilderness of black hair, a kaleidoscope of pale flesh, and a thousand twisted mouths all at once. It emerged from the mirror and filled the room. I felt the cold hair on my face, then a voice saying ""pretty, pretty, pretty"". Franklin was gone, enveloped in the universe of hair and flesh and mouths. 

I felt one of the mouths on mine, then another on my neck. The hair was all over me. There were hands in the flesh, fractal fingers grasping at my nightgown, then at the buttons of my jeans. 

I can only describe what happened next as the most intense fellatio I ever experienced then or since. Bloody Mary brought me quickly to completion. This was the true face of Bloody Mary--insane female energy, a succubus of some kind. I blacked out. 

When I came to, I checked my jeans--nothing seemed out of place and there was not a drop of semen in my underwear. Franklin was smoking in the corner and I recounted my story to him. He wasn't surprised that the semen was gone--he suggested it had been transmutated. He said he'd experienced something similar during the ritual. After that he didn't talk much at all. 

I cleaned myself up and drank some water for my headache, then headed home feeling really weirded out.",2016-01-04 00:24:14+00:00,cyky6gi,4.0,t1_cykwy9c,1925.0,AskReddit
1272,"Franklin gave me a drink that tasted like vodka and coke. He necked a tumbler of the stuff himself. He said it was blessed through another of his secret rituals, and it would help to ease open my third eye. I liked vodka and my parents were out of town so I thought, 'what the hell' and drank about four.

Franklin lit some candles and we sat on cushions in front of the mirror. The mirror was tilted slightly towards us, so it looked like the floor was sloped steeply upwards. The markings on the floor and the markings on the mirror matched exactly to form a continuous circle. 

Franklin hummed a three-note dirge and asked me to repeat it while he chanted some words from his ritual. I was surprised when the darkness of the corners of the room seemed to deepen and take on an increasingly complex texture. The scrawl on the mirror seemed to change and intensify too, like I was truly seeing for the first time, or seeing the infinitely-more-complex astral writing behind it. I hummed and hummed. 

""Don't stop, nomatter what,"" he said.",2016-01-03 23:52:09+00:00,cykwy9c,3.0,t1_cykwbp3,977.0,AskReddit
1273,"The ritual was simple, he said. He also said it would be extremely dangerous in the wrong hands, as it created a temporary window to a part of the Astral plane reserved for insane, obsessed spirits. Franklin explained that Bloody Mary was not one spirit but a whole class of 'murderous female' spirits, stuck in simplistic cognitive loops based on the circumstances of their short and awful lives. 

They hate men in particular, so one precaution was to dress as girls. Franklin had a long black Cher wig and I was a redhead for the evening. He had me rouge my cheeks and carefully put lipstick on me. I didn't need to wear a dress, but Franklin carefully draped a silk nightgown over me so it looked like I was wearing it from the POV of the mirror. 

It was about then, staring at a female version of myself in a mirror covered in strange hexes, that I knew I had made some weird choices, the kind you don't come back from if anyone finds out. I made Franklin confirm that the shack door was locked, which he obliged. ",2016-01-03 23:35:52+00:00,cykwbp3,2.0,t1_cykvk3o,1156.0,AskReddit
1274,"Yes. Let me tell you about Franklin from my school days. 

Franklin was an edgy young fellow who wore a lot of black and believed he had a whole library of magickal powers. I found his earnest weirdness fascinating, and although I wasn't his best buddy or anything, I would hang out with him to question him on his activities. He practised everything under the sun. 

He believed he could astrally project, and had a teacher on the 'other side' who taught him magickal rituals. I asked him about Bloody Mary and he just laughed it off, but he said he would ask his astral teacher about it and we could try whatever it suggested. 

A few days passed; he said that he sometimes had trouble entering the OBE state. I figured he was just taking his time to invent the ritual. Then one Friday he came to school excited with a Bloody Mary summoning ritual written in his folder. 

I went to his house that evening and he took me straight out back to his shed. His family had a shed in a secluded part of his yard that his mother let him turn into his magickal fortress. Think dreamcatchers, pentagrams, lots of black paint. He showed me an old army cot that he called his 'astral launchpad'. He had a lot of drawings of his astral teacher (typical old dude in a sharp suit) on the walls. 

In the corner he had a tall mirror with a sheet over it. He said the mirror could confuse him on the astral plane, so he kept it covered. He pulled the sheet away to reveal a complex pentagram arrangement drawn in whiteout or something similar. ",2016-01-03 23:16:36+00:00,cykvk3o,1.0,t3_3zbwxh,1698.0,AskReddit

1331,"Nobody believes me because they're all 'aw boo hoo this book says you die after 3 days' but I stayed up for six nights when I was 16 to write a 40,000 word paper that was due that week. I've just realised I now have no idea what the paper was about. It was apparently very good. I remember writing about a dog for a while before I realised what I was doing and deleted it. 

I listened to a lot of music. I had a lot of showers. I sprinkled instant coffee on popcorn as a snack. Every morning I had to stop what I was doing and get on a bus to the technical college, where I would have to go to a lab and keep working. I looked and felt like absolute shit by day 3, obviously. My friend told me that I looked like a bag of shit with skin made of shit. I was grey/green and broke out in acne. 

After day 3 I didn't feel worse, or more exhausted, I had maxed out exhaustion so I just felt more and more distant from the world. I was a robot during days 4 and 5. Hallucinations kicked in and I just had to ignore them. Lines would bend. Patterns would swirl. The grass looked very green, everything else was grey. 

I handed in my report and felt utter relief. Didn't sleep yet. I went home and experimented with the hallucinations. Watched the wallpaper bubble. Then had a nice big drink of water and a sandwich and slept for 18 hours or so. 

I felt fine afterwards but I've always felt like I burned some part of myself out, or opened a door into weirdness afterwards. Sleep paralysis became common. And more, much more. But mostly that feeling of distance never fully left me.

Also, I'd pulled single or double all-nighters before that incident, but afterwards it was ridiculously easy to stay awake. Even now nearly 20 years later I get tired for about 30 minutes and if I can push through then I have no feeling of exhaustion at all.

During a pre-op interview he revealed that he was convinced he was going to say awful things while in the fugue state. He said he'd read a story about a guy confessing to being a filthy pedophile while under anaesthetic in a magazine 20 years before, and he was sure he was going to do the same, even though he wasn't actually a pedophile. The story had lingered in his mind for years. He'd avoided surgery for that reason. 

They came to an agreement to ease his mind: the anaesthesiologist put him under in a private room. ""He was fighting it all the way down,"" he said. 

When he woke in the recovery room (which takes far longer than getting put under!) he told a nurse that he was a pedophile with a massive collection of pictures at home. She hadn't been warned about him and reported him to the police. They searched his house while he was still in hospital. ",2015-12-17 15:17:11+00:00,cy29jtx,1.0,t3_3x7yeo,941.0,AskReddit

1583,"There are few cultural differences as they are all essentially the same country (Great Britain). The people come from identical genetic stock (anglo-saxon) with a common culture. In Scotland and other parts of northern england they say 'aye' when they mean yes because of a misprint in an early printing of the Bible--you need to look out for that.

The Irish often claim to be a separate country, this widespread cultural meme becomes more pronounced as you go from north to south. It's a kind of joke they play on foreigners to see if they will believe it. If you deny their sovereignty three times they have to let you in on the joke. 

Wales is sometimes called 'The West Country', which is another joke as it's the most central and populous of the four. They are famous for the dismal QA of their roadsign manufacture industry. 

England (sometimes just 'Greater London') is a dazzling cultural melting-pot of actual English people and the foreigners who despise their way of life. It's an exciting experiment that is bound to succeed.

1612,"Alright. My machinist friend, right, was tired of having his tent stepped on or broken into by idiots at music festivals, so he decided to make himself an indestructible 'sleeping pod' out of two (unused!) oil drums welded end-to-end with a hatch in one end. It had simple angle-bar legs to stop it from rolling, a window, breathing holes, a sleeping bag, and a battery that ran a little light and fan. He mounted carrying handles on its sides like a coffin, and the whole thing was light enough for two men to comfortably carry from the back of his truck to wherever. 

It drew a lot of stares but nobody could mess with it. It was great for locking away our valuables during the day. The only problem was at night, when passersby would drum on it, eliciting muted wails from my friend inside. By the second season with the pod, he lagged the outside with heating tank insulation and foil blankets and the drumming/chronic overheating problem was more or less resolved. 

Well, this was great, until we go to this one venue and somebody steals the pod (with him in it) during the night. I was in in a tent right next to it and heard nothing, because he either failed to wake up, or because of all the soundproofing. I woke at about 8am and discovered him missing, so I set off trying to work out where he'd gone. Nobody had seen anything. The only thing I had to go on was one report of a group of older guys carrying a long barbecue out in the direction of the parking area just before dawn. They were apparently grey-haired retiree-looking types wearing neat shirts tucked into chinos.

Well, that was that. I tried calling him but his phone just rang until it passed me to voicemail. Eventually (about 4pm that day) it stopped ringing altogether. I called his brother and his parents, and they called the cops. The cops were actually very helpful and agreed to keep an eye on the roads leading out of town. They also searched a local scrap merchant but found nothing. 

Days passed and there was no sign of the pod or my friend. Then it was a week, then two weeks. His mother was in already in poor health (one of those no-legs diabetics) and she died from the stress. The FBI were involved and they thought the description of the men matched some other goings-on they were looking into in Kentucky, but they had no leads in either state and nothing whatsoever to go on.

Well, as Yoda kinda said, 'there was another'. This one grew just above my hairline like a little horn. I let it go for a while but it was interfering with my hair game (I prefer my hair short, but had to keep it kinda long to hide the bump) so it had to go.

Two days ago I sterilized a scalpel and carefully washed the area with antiseptic and antibacterial soap. I heated the area for a while to soften up the cyst contents, then I stabbed the cyst to make a 3-4mm cut in the skin and the cyst wall beneath.

Over the course of an hour I squeezed out the contents (a bloody mush). It took quite a bit of force and a couple of probing stabs with the scalpel through the same cut at different angles to get it all; the area is still bruised. I made animal noises. Soap and blood stung my eyes. After a while the pale rubbery cyst wall itself began to emerge. I had to make a second cut in the cyst wall to squeeze out the last of the contents, then I just grabbed the cyst itself between thumb and forefinger and pulled it out. Glorious.

As you can see it came out clean, in one piece! What you see here was about 7mm across.

Yesterday I squeezed some clear fluid from the cut and took care of it by keeping the area sterile and coated in germaline. Today the skin is only slightly swollen from bruising, and dry--the cut has healed over. I can brush my hair again without needing to navigate around the area!

I thought I would share!

P.S. Sadly, my phone died before I could take more pictures. Picture this: the inside was as smooth and pale as the outside. The walls were quite thick.

1666,"I'm playing this evening, so if I observe ''phantom XP"" on my travels I'll share the video. (I've definitely just received XP for a companion kill as well.) I agree that it's not consistent, but I'd lean towards there being some rules behind it and it's not just a random thing (although it could well be).

In case luck factors in, my character is level 70, with 12 luck.

**Test 1:** Encountered a group of raiders outside Greentop Nursery. Personally killed three of them to thin the herd. Allowed Preston Garvey to attack the Legendary Raider while I kited her around a tree. Preston was ineffectual, but a passing Brotherhood of Steel Vertibird wore her down with their minigun. I believe they had the final shot. I am allied with the BoS. **No XP awarded for the kill.**

**Test 2:** Informed of Raider Troubles at the Slog. On the short trek there from Greentop Nursery, Preston and I encountered three high-level Stingwings. I had no choice but to intervene due to Preston's awful aim. All XP was accounted for. Leaving the area, **I was awarded 25XP for nothing in particular** (no gunshots, Preston in full view, all nearby points of interest already found). Hypothesis: a well-armed Provisioner wanders that road, may have killed something nearby. Alternatively, the BoS squad may still have been in the area.

**Test 3:** Encountered three bloatflies on the road to the Slog. I did not engage. Preston fired his usual barrage of warning shots and one shot happened to connect, **netting me 20XP**. I hid in a truck while he loosed laser shots in the general direction of the remaining pair. I witnessed him kill at least one, **with no XP for me**. I believe the other may have been killed by the local Provisioner, but its body is unaccounted for.

**Test 4:** Arrived at the Slog and heard the pop of gunfire at the far end of the settlement. My settlers were engaged in an all-out assault against two or three Forged and a group of wandering Raiders. I did not engage, and I ordered Preston to wait it out behind the settlement walls. My battery of laser turrets reached as far as the bridge and the chain-link fence of the Saugus Ironworks, but I believe most of the killing was done by settlers armed with Flamers. **I received 56XP and 7XP**. While my settlers wandered home and I was busy counting bodies, I received **another 20XP for no obvious reason**. I counted a total of eight bodies.

**Test 5:** Wiseman of the Slog directed me back to Saugus Ironworks to kill a 'raider' in the area. After killing a few Forged in the initial area of the plant, I found a Utility Protectron. I gave the Protectron the Law Enforcement behavior and followed about twenty yards behind it on its route. It soon encountered more Forged and engaged them with its nail guns. It killed at least one; **I received 7XP**.

**Test 6:** Back on the road with ol' Pristine Gravy. The people of Greentop Nurseries took issue with a group of ghouls in College Square, several miles to the south. We are proceeding on foot. Preston took care of a Synth and a Synth Strider as we passed through Malden. **I received no XP**.

**Test 7:** Approached Taffington Boathouse and heard the usual anti-bloodbug turret fire down by the canal. **7XP received**. A group of settlers ventured in the direction of Malden taking shots at bloodbugs with their pipe guns. They followed an infected bloodbug all the way to a hill overlooking Malden and finished it off, **netting me 48XP**. The group were attacked immediately afterward by a radscorpion; they killed the creature while Preston attempted to frighten it off with his laser. **I received no XP**. [I made a video!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbr8X8gnlSU)

**Test 8:** My settlement at Covenant was under attack by a group of about ten Super Mutants and their hounds. I knew this would be an interesting battle as Covenant is where I send most of my companions when I'm not traveling with them. The result: **ten green corpses, no XP**.

**Test 9:** A bright fog closed around us as we arrived in the north of the old city. Pissed 'n' Groovy killed a Legendary black bloatfly _with a single well-aimed shot_ as we skirted around Mass Gravel &amp; Sand. I was dumbstruck **but received no XP.**

**Test 10:** Encountered a pair of Brotherhood vertibirds. They set down and took on a group of supermutants, netting me a new legendary rifle (2x critical hit damage!) but **no XP**. The vertibirds have taken fire from the Corvega plant nearby, so I will follow the squad into the battle and see what comes of it. [Addendum: the vertibirds gave up on Corvega, and the BoS Knights seem to want to hang around this bombed-out Pharmacy, so we'll just continue to College Square.]

**Test 11:** Arrived in College Square with the far-off drone of vertibirds still overhead. Woke the ghouls and kited them in the direction of Cambridge Police Station, just a street away. A troupe of Brotherhood Aspirants took them out with a barrage of laser fire. **No XP whatsoever**. What am I doing differently? Has my luck simply ran out tonight? Am I not paying enough attention?

**Theory:** I'm just a stone's throw off level 71. Maybe there's a limit to how much incidental XP you can be rewarded for any given level? I think I'll level up and see if my luck changes.

**Test 12:** Activated two protectrons in College Station. I'm still level 70. The protectrons (one of them legendary) devastated about nine ghouls; **no XP awards.** 

**BUT THEN:** I decided to execute my legendary protectron buddy for his gear and paid for it with my life when he exploded. That gets me _every damn time_. This presented an interesting opportunity however! What happens under identical conditions after dying and reloading? Well, the XP came rolling in. **I received XP for the two ghoul kills that immediately followed, then none for another seven or so**.

A Gunner's Note has directed me to look for a Hunting Rifle in Monsignor Plaza. It's a short detour on my journey south into the city proper, where fights rage more or less all the time. Let's see what happens on the way. 

**Test 13:** After a nice Sandman kill in Monsignor Plaza I am now level 71. We headed south past Ticonderoga to the bridge. Heard gunfire. It was a Raider Veteran vs. somebody throwing pulse grenades; possibly one of my own Provisioners, I didn't get a look at them. Preston engaged the Raider, which brought all hell down on our heads, so I hid in a Pulowski Preservation Shelter and waited for the XP to roll in. There was a flaw in this plan--Preston can't hit anything with his hand-cranked laser pointer--so I lent him the Spray 'n' Pray in the hope that it would work to his strengths. It didn't, at least not at first. After crossing the bridge he tried to beat a bear to death with the handle of the _explosive sub-machine gun_. 

Nomatter--after stimpacking Preston I heard gunfire and vertibird engines and the shouts of Raiders and Super Mutants nearby. I involved myself in the fight by shooting a single Raider. Shortly afterwards, **I received hundreds of XP when something died and Idiot Savant kicked in** and then **85XP when a Raider killed a Super Mutant Overlord**. Preston killed another Super Mutant and I received **another 85XP**. I realised I was crouched in a crowd of Raiders just watching Preston fight on the broken overpass above. Preston turned the Spray 'n' Pray on the Raiders and they died in a kind of bloody meteorite shower, **giving me no XP**.",2015-12-04 17:07:43+00:00,cxn38lf,5.0,t1_cxn1w4l,1951.0,fo4

1671,"Generally you get XP for any kills you're within a certain range of. I hear the pop of gunfire in the city all the time, no XP granted, but if I venture close enough to the gunfire (usually close enough to be within view of the battle) then I get XP.

&amp;nbsp;

_7:35am, Terminal 5, Gate 26F._ A long nuclear airliner warms up on the tarmac beyond the window, chrome gleaming in the sun. A loose congregation of travellers gathers by the gate. The lone security guard smiles and nods as he ticks names off the flight list. Ninety-nine percent of his job is just looking out for Chinese people, but now and then...

""Hello sir. Sorry about this, but, you know, it's my job to ask--what do you have there?"" 

""Oh, nothing. Just a hydraulic punching aid.""

""Fine, fine. I see you've augmented it somewhat--""

""--with a reinforced concrete slab, yes. I've left some bare rebar jutting out for penetrating power. I could punch through an inch of steel with this baby.""

""I can see that. Well, I guess you're _unarmed!_ So please enjoy your flight!""

The man tips his trilby and goes on his way.

&amp;nbsp;

_11:50am._ Another flight, another queue. The guard's gaze falls on a matronly woman in her late fifties. There's something sticking out of her bag, a wooden peg, or handle...

""Ma'am. Over here please.""

""Well hello, officer. How can I help you?""

""Over here please ma'am. I must insist."" He pops the snap-button on the holster of his 10mm automatic pistol and lets his fingers rest on the grip. ""No need for alarm. I just need to take a peek in your bag, then you can be on your way.""

""Oh, you're worried about this?"" She unzips her bag and withdraws a rolling pin. The crowd gasp and scream and scatter towards the exits. ""What? What? I'm returning it to my mother in Florida. We're making pumpkin pie.""

The security guard whips out his pistol and slams a red button under his desk. Immediately he begins loosing headshots in the woman's direction (only one out of six connect due to his low perception). The bullet grazes the woman's skull and she staggers back, rolling pin raised. A huge sentry bot skids out of a nearby alcove, vents gouting fusion steam, minigun spinning up. ""SUSPECT IS ARMED! SUSPECT IS ARMED!"" A hail of gunfire turns the woman into a hot blood-mist. Her rolling-pin lands on the floor, still gripped by her disembodied hand.

Genetics/philosophy question: is sex with an age-appropriate granddaughter you've never met _really any worse_ than sex with a cousin? How genetically similar are you in each case? When does it become okay?

(Just asking in case I'm ever frozen for centuries.)

Here's how I'd approach it. Let's think of the common denominator in each case..._my_ grandparents.

Myself and my sexy cousin share 1 set of grandparents. Right? So (ignoring the fact that our parents from the same grandparent pair aren't actually identical twins), 1/3rd of our genes are from the same source. 

My granddaughter has all four of my grandparents in her genes (through me). They are her great-great grandparents. She should have another four through my wife, and another eight from Shaun's partner. _Hopefully_ that's sixteen different people. So that's four out of sixteen. Only 1/4th of our genes come from the same people. Right? It's better than cousins. _This is fine, Piper._

But then...that's not quite right, is it. Because cousins are related through a sibling pair and not the same person. There's randomness at play. I'm 100% me, and my granddaughter is 25% me _for sure_. 

Oh god help me, redneck math is hard

&amp;nbsp;

""Mom."" It's his voice. She feels her stomach turn. Her husband emerges from his study, a stack of fresh flyers in his hands.

&amp;nbsp;

""Davey? Is that you Davey? Oh god...oh god, where have you been?""

&amp;nbsp;

He replies in a pained sing-song. ""Clowning around. Ha! He! Ho! Bum-de-diddly-o! Clowning around in the pa-ark!""

&amp;nbsp;

She waves for her husband. She mouths 'park'. He drops the flyers, grabs his keys and runs for the car, leaving the porch door swinging behind him. The flyers scatter over the hallway floor, turning into a kaleidoscope of the same pair of images of her son; the first in his blue robes from a graduation day that seemed like a lifetime ago, the second with longer hair and a crooked smile in a picture taken during some college party. ""It's been ten months, Davey! We thought you were dead!"" Tires squeal in the drive and their old Mazda launches into the street. A horn blares.

&amp;nbsp;

""Oh no, mom. I just made some new friends! Or was I _remade_ by them? I can't remember! Ha! I refuse to remember and you can't make me!"" 

&amp;nbsp;

""Davey. Stay where you are. Your father's on his way. Just talk to me, sweetie. Tell me where exactly you are in the park.""

&amp;nbsp;

""I wish I could chatty-chit for longer, mom. But I think I'm about to make a new friend! Somebody's taking my picture, stealing my soul!"" He let out a long, breathless laugh. ""Ho-hi-ho! Do you like clowns?"" She felt her knees weaken. Keep him talking. Keep him talking. Robert would be on the phone to the detective. The wheels were in motion.

&amp;nbsp;

""Davey? Where have you been staying? Talk to me, son.""

&amp;nbsp;

""Where do clowns stay, you silly goose? The C-I-R-C-U-S! Oh mom, that's the life for me!""

&amp;nbsp;

""Son...just stop. Just stop. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for whatever we did wrong. Whatever it was that made you feel like we had to be punished. We just want you home. We miss you. Your sister misses you.""

&amp;nbsp;

""I am home."" She heard a rush of wind followed by a loud crack, then the line went dead. After a few seconds, a robotic voice told her that the caller had disconnected. She pressed the handset to her ear and let the voice repeat itself god-knows how many times before she let it drop.

&amp;nbsp;

Robert stayed out until morning but found nothing, not even the phone. The detective put it down to a cruel hoax, but he was wrong. It was him.

Or: he's purposefully giving you the cold shoulder in the hope you realise how much you needed him, and how deeply in love with him you really are. That's weird game-playing and probably not something you should encourage or otherwise seek in a dude, even if it feels good to be wanted.

Personal experience: I was infatuated with a girl (call her girl X) for a couple of years from about 19-20, we hung out all the time, but I didn't know how to turn it into a romantic relationship. I had another girlfriend for a while, she had a boyfriend for a while, so it didn't feel right to cheat which further complicated things. Then the stars shifted or something and I met/was romantically involved with a few great girls in quick succession. The prior infatuation didn't seem so important then. I met the girl who is now (12 years later!) my wife, and although I missed hanging out with girl X, I _had to choose_, as I don't have an infinite well of emotional availability or time, and having girl X in the picture would have made my future wife uncomfortable. I had to break off contact, and I'm pretty sure girl X understood why. She put out feelers to see how things were going maybe a year later, I was happy in my new relationship, and after a friendly conversation she never contacted me again.

I was transporting a dog corpse across town when all of a sudden this awful smell hit me. I put the top down for air and high-tailed it home. After pulling into my drive, I popped the trunk and leapt from the car. The dog had voided its bowels, and the movement of the car had smeared the mess all over the upholstery. 

I held my nose and hauled the dog out of there, then stripped the trunk down to the metal. At this point my clothes were soiled, so I disrobed, as you can see. I found the clorox and a rag and got to cleaning; now, I figured nobody wants to look at a nude man all bent over his trunk so I climbed inside to clean it in relative privacy.

You stumble across a hunter's cabin; stopping to boil up some coffee and get warm before you head back down the mountain feels like a great idea. You go around to the door but find it padlocked. Peering through the small filthy windows, you realize it is a twisted fuckhut full of furry dolls.


You hear the far-off drone of a dirtbike approaching. _Shit._


Stepping away from the hut, you hear a horrifying click and feel an explosion of pain in your right leg. A bear trap! Your knees give way and you crumple into a snowbank, blood pouring from your ruined ankle. You see a hemisphere of pale polished bone where the skin has been torn away. Your Achilles tendon is caught between the iron incisors like a strap of pale jerky. You feel yourself weaken; thinking quickly, you pull the drawstring from your coat and tie it above the wound, stemming the flow of blood. You try to move into cover, but you only make it a few agonizing steps before the snow reveals a taut chain leading from the trap to a nearby trunk, the steel fresh and bright. You empty your pack and search for anything to lever the trap open, but it's too late. The forest darkens.


""Say, 'help me, Daddy.'""


You slowly return to consciousness, cold to the bone. You can't feel your right leg below the knee.

So, the last venting of gas was 11:56 on 12/31/99. _Venting gas prevents explosion._ What happens when GET_CURRENT_TIME() returns 00:01 on 01/01/00? Well 0 is less than 99, so no venting of gas will occur. -52569995 minutes have passed.  If the year part of the dates were stored as 1999 and 2000, you'd have no problem at all.

1973,"You want plenty of acceleration (don't be shy, if the engine wails then just ease off a little next time), and gentle release of the clutch over a couple of seconds. 

You should practice moving the car extremely slowly by balancing the clutch and accelerator. See how slow you can make it move, in first gear and reverse. See how under-control you can be. Good control means balancing the clutch and accelerator to minimize revs/maximize useful work for the engine/avoid stalling with some safety margin.

Next, try the same thing with more acceleration but the same amount of clutch release. This isn't great for the car, but it will build your confidence that nothing crazy will happen. The car will make a lot of noise and move a little quicker. Don't do this for long.

Next, try slowly releasing the clutch while you slowly increase acceleration. Think of the clutch and accelerator pedals as two ends of a see-saw. By 'slowly' I just mean 'in a controlled manner' over a couple of seconds. 

The car will only stall if you lack the momentum to get the wheels turning. Once you've eased up to a few mph you can release that clutch pedal fully and accelerate all you like (and probably immediately move into 2nd gear). 

Most cars will be forgiving about rapidly releasing the clutch if you apply enough acceleration to overcome friction (now you're wheelspinning!) So err on the side of acceleration, be confident, and be as smooth as possible with your clutch release (so as not to overcome friction!)

It could work. But as someone else pointed out, it would be a total remake--not just a question of upgrading the maps and models--or else you could easily walk the game in an hour. MGSV is designed for large open spaces, and large groups of enemies instead of two or three. 

You could re-create the top-down look of the earlier games, restrict weaponry and sneaking options etc, but then...what would be the point?

I was just re-watching some MGS3 yesterday and there's generally only a couple of enemies in each section of the jungle. Back then it was a real challenge. Now it would just be pop-pop-pop, walk through the level. But a total remake? Yeah I'd love that. 

Honestly I would like to see an MGS6 made (by Kojima productions) in the Fox Engine with all of the lessons learned from MGSV applied. But sadly we'd need an interdimensional portal to a better universe for that.

Just think how amazing a MG1 remake could actually be. Afghanistan and Africa are basically huge flat areas with tiny outposts and bases dotted here and there, and Snake is essentially overpowered with vast resources at his command. Instead imagine something with the density of a Dark Souls game instead, and an OSP mission--gradually infiltrating a vast base/war-city of interconnected areas full of zealous soldiers and the planet's weirdest characters.

I've even watched the youtube video about five times. The R&amp;D platform is like a blind spot in my brain. This must be what dementia feels like. I only just figured out how to actually get from the ground level to the upper level _without climbing on pipes._

Here's my strategy: 

- Maxed out stun assault rifle with magnifying red-dot scope
- Get targets on initial area and the area below with the pair of cranes
- Run to the upper helipad, get every target I can see from there (including targets down between the helipad and the guard rail) 
- Run down the center of the R&amp;D platform, getting every target on the stairwells
- Run around the outside of the R&amp;D platform, running out into the connecting spurs and helipad for a better view, getting every target on the outside, including the two hidden below the upper helipad
- Now, WTF...where are the last seven targets? Run back up the inside of the R&amp;D platform, find nothing. Am I on the same staircase? Run back down to the other staircase, find nothing. _Is there even another staircase I don't know_
- Turn on NVG for another check
- Check around the lower levels (I _know_ there's nothing down there)
- Time runs out
- Weep

I'm doing this. I'm doing this tonight. I'm going to pour myself a drink and make a note of every single target in the youtube video. Every move, frame by frame. 

Edit: 34/35! Okay! Getting there! My strategy has changed, now I clear the upper level and slowly work my way down the outside of the building getting every target I can on each part of the outer structure and whatever I can see on the inside. I've spotted a few targets that are side-on from any POV. There must be one more...

The Monday after next is my six month anniversary with Diamond Dogs. That'll mean my probation period is officially up, and it'll become legally tricky to fire me. The first thing I'm going to do is march into Kaz's office and respectfully ask for a raise. I was the very first soldier the Boss hired with solid C's across the board; I deserve to see that reflected in my wage. 

We're going to have that wedding, Joanie! I told you everything would work out! 

Word is there's some new hires arriving from Afghanistan this evening. They're usually a bit belligerent when they wake up (remember how I was at first?) but they'll soon come round to the Diamond Dog way of thinking. I'm not sure where we're going to put them! As far as I know every department is full, and even the waiting room is packed with talented guys! I have no idea why the Boss keeps extracting more.

You won't believe this. Get ready to buy that '11 Toyota you've been looking at--I've been recruited by Diamond Dogs!

I was never more than above-average at Intel gathering, and my other skills as a soldier haven't been the same since the cancer scare, but I'm really trying this time. I'm part of a great team, and I feel like I'm finally applying myself. My head's de-fogged. I love you, Joanie. Everything's going to be alright.

Some of the other guys have taken to hiding the diamonds that they find around base, but I'm an honest solider. Stealthy Wombat is always boasting about his skill (honestly I think he's nothing to write home about, even though I'm writing home about him!). You know me--I'm a humble soldier. Crude Jaguar is always pushing other guys about and giving them PTSD, but he's A++ rated in combat so the Boss turns a blind eye to it (really--he's actually blind in one eye). Me, I don't bully the smaller guys. I like to think the Boss sees that, and appreciates it.

In [mission 22, where you infiltrate the R&amp;D platform](/spoiler) I remember thinking, 'wow, it would be great if there were infiltration missions on each platform.'. Well there are! It's all available via the FOB system. As a defender you are incentivized to make it as tough (and therefore as fun) as possible for an attacker.

I think a lot of people see the FOB as a miserable chore that you need to perform in order to raise your staff and combat deployment limits. They're kinda missing the point. That said, the public perception of the FOB system has been ruined by the shitty servers (I got thrown off randomly last night again), the nickel-and-diming with MB coins, and the hackers on PC.

Your unused muscles would have shrunken and contracted to lock your limbs in a permanent spasm, so even if your brain miraculously de-fogged enough to allow you to function as a fully conscious human being (after a few years of therapy) you might never step out of a wheelchair. Regular stretching during your coma can mitigate this somewhat but the best case scenario is still awful.

Unless you're Big Boss, of course, and you just shake yourself down and walk it off.

Edit: that said, 9 years from now there might be a neural prosthesis available to support the functions of your atrophied brain and speed your recovery. Stem-cell rejuvenation therapy with a bunch of fantastic 2024-era steroids might be able to get your motor neurons and muscles going again.

I'd guess that relay stations will be necessary infrastructure for future interstellar probes, but even that would only be the case if the massive cost of launching a relay station to a midway point (maybe 2 light years out!) was less than the cost of sending a bigger/better transmitter on the probe itself.

Second, you have introduced two new points of failure. (Presumably your probe no longer has the ability to communicate with Earth by itself.)

Third, unless your probe is very close to the relay stations, it still needs a high-gain directional antenna. Those are already capable of communication with Earth, so there's no benefit.

A nebula might be ten light years across and 1000 light years away--so that's 0.01 radians, or about 0.5 degrees of sky, or 34 arcminutes (bigger than the full moon).

Hubble has a resolution of 0.1 arcseconds--so Pluto would be (approx) one pixel wide on its detector, and the nebula would be 204000 pixels (so big that it couldn't possibly image it all at once!) The pixel analogy isn't quite right but you get the idea.

2413,"If you really wanted to, you could strap engines to the largest asteroids and bring them together _gently_. There are other ways to move asteroids around; it may be enough that you install attitude control motors and paint one side of the asteroid white, using radiation pressure to do the pushing. 

With _hundreds_ of Trojans in one place with zero velocity relative to each other, you could hope to build a rubble-pile perhaps 300-400km across. It would not pull in other asteroids to begin a chain reaction (they are all very far apart). If a body happened to wander into its small SOI with a low relative velocity it could be pulled into an orbit or a collision.

Edit: To work this out properly we need some math.

You need to choose a camp (one of the two Lagrangian points)--I would go with L4, as it contains 624 Hektor, largest of the Trojans at 370x200 km and 9.95x10^18 kg. Your job will be to create an aggregation of large asteroids with 624 Hektor in the middle, such that its Hill sphere (area of space it has influence over) extends to cover enough of the volume to bring more small asteroids into its orbit, which can then be decelerated (through manual intervention, tidal forces, or enough random head-on collisions and near-misses with other bodies) to join the central body.

There are estimated to be about 63000 (+/- 10000) Trojans with a diameter larger than 2km in the L4 region. If you manually bring together the top 8 (objects with diameters in the 100-200km range, including 624 Hektor) you would end up with a single object with a mass of 2.7×10^19 kg (that's a rough estimate based on Hektor's mass and the other bodies' sizes). You want to collide them in such a way that each addition introduces a healthy amount of rotational energy (though not enough to pull the body apart through centrifugal force). We'll spend this rotational energy later to draw in other asteroids using tidal drag. 

Bringing together the top eight asteroids is _probably_ not enough for the body to pull itself together into a sphere. The smallest body believed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium is Mimas, at 3.7x10^19 kg. It's still not bad! The component parts of our new body will not be drifting apart anytime soon.

So how large is our Hill sphere?

If we use the Sun as our secondary mass (the 'perturber' that tries to steal our little moons), we get a Hill sphere of 129,223 km (smaller than the Hill sphere with respect to Jupiter). Stable orbits are half of that, so we can expect to attract any bodies with a low relative velocity within 60,000 km or so and perhaps grab a few further out. 

...how many would that be? That depends on the average density of the Trojan field surrounding 624 Hektor. It was tricky to get a number for the spatial density of the L4 Trojan field in actual objects-per-cubic-km. [I ended up referring to this paper](http://pasj.oxfordjournals.org/content/60/2/293.full) which gives a value of 14.7 Trojans over 2km per-degree-squared-of-sky. That's a measure in two dimensions from Earth's POV. One degree of sky at the distance of the Trojans from Earth at the time of the study (about 6.2 AU) equates to about 0.1 AU, or 15,000,000 km. So in every 0.1 AU^2 of the Trojan field they spotted 14.7 Trojans. Of course the field has depth--something like 1 AU. If the 14.7 asteroids are spread equally across that 1 AU depth (which is another approximation, they will follow a curve of some kind), that's 1.47 asteroids per 0.1 AU^3. 

Our effective SOI is approximately a 9.04x10^14 km^3 volume of space. 0.1 AU^3 is 3.35x10^23 km^3 of space. So essentially we have _no chance_ of having even one body over 2km in our SOI. There may be a scattering of tiny bodies (most bodies under a certain size are thought to have migrated in towards the Sun years ago) but it won't be enough to grow our SOI in a runaway fashion. Your celestial engineers have some more manual work to do to build their mini-Mimas. 

So let's say they go and manually attract more objects into our SOI...we move to phase 2. You can wait until they are dragged into contact with our new dwarf planet though tidal drag alone, or you can just crash them into the new body; it depends on how patient you are (do you have a few million years to spare?)

In the end you will be left with a small rock/ice dwarf planet, perhaps with a liquid ocean that would remain warm for millions of years. (I couldn't guess as to the long-term stability of the planet at Jupiter's L4.)",2015-07-13 20:00:31+00:00,ct22t7z,4.0,t1_ct1ul6g,12173.0,space

I would guess that Uranus would wither away (over millions of years) if it was transplanted into an orbit matching that of Venus, but the interactions between its weird magnetic field and the solar wind are difficult to predict.

However, let's set them up in opposing orbits for a head-on collision somewhere around the orbit of Ceres.

Venus is more dense, being made of rocky material as opposed to ice and gas, but Uranus is significantly more massive, with a huge mantle of hot, high-pressure ices surrounding a small rocky core. Venus would be destroyed in the collision, and Uranus would be significantly disrupted, perhaps unravelling into a hot cloud of ice and rock in a plane perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic. 

Tidal forces from the Sun would gradually twist the combined rotating mass of _Uranvenus_ into line with the ecliptic, a process which would result in a fair bit of tidal heating. The result would be a large, puffy sphere that would differentiate and cool slowly into an object with a greater density than the original Uranus, with dirty new clouds made of gases supplied by Venus.

2424,"First of all, some moons are oddly shaped because they are too small for their own gravity to pull them into a spherical shape (i.e. they are not in a state of hydrostatic equilibrium).

If a moon or other body is large enough to be in a state of hydrostatic equilibrium, then the primary force responsible for its shape is its own gravity, which can be thought of as pulling equally in all directions towards the object's center. In the absence of other forces this would create a perfect sphere, but there are other forces at play.

1) The body is rotating, so any given point in its volume is subject to a centrifugal force that counters some portion of its self-gravitation. This is true at every latitude but the effect is more pronounced closer to the equator. For a given rotational period, this effect will be more pronounced if the object is less dense (e.g made out of water ice instead of rock).

2) The body exists in a local gravitational gradient (the gravity of a parent body or a significant moon), countering some portion of the body's own gravity along the gravitational axis.

If someone had a means of permanently switching off the Sun's gravity, it's upper layers would billow outwards under a kind of high-temperature Brownian motion and fusion would quickly cease; it would become a warm hydrogen cloud spreading indefinitely under the velocity imparted in that initial explosion.

If someone guided an existing white dwarf to the Sun's core, the white dwarf would collapse under the additional pressure, exploding with enough energy to rip the Sun apart in a spectacular (and unusually hydrogen-rich) type Ia supernova. The expanding shockwave might momentarily compress the Sun into a hollow sphere, causing further fusion in this thin Sun-layer, causing a secondary nova.

2433,"The collision would be fun to watch, very informative, and probably not dangerous. 

The comet would be the most significant thing in the night sky for days beforehand because of its tail--the tail would look absolutely huge at that distance.

We would hope the impact took place at night somewhere over Europe so the majority of the human race could watch first-hand. First we would get a real intuitive sense of the huge velocity of the comet relative to the moon--let's say 40 km/s--the two objects separately would have looked still in the sky just the night before, but now we would see the comet nucleus approaching the Moon by a Moon's-width every minute. (The last few seconds of the video stream from the poor doomed Rosetta probe would be astounding.)

The mass of 67P is estimated at 1.0×10^13 kg. Traveling at 40 km/s relative to the Moon, that means it has a kinetic energy of 8×10^21 J (joules). That equates to 1912000 megatons of TNT. This energy is released from an object 4km in length, traveling at 40km/s, so it takes 0.1 seconds, meaning that the peak energy dissipation of the event is 8x10^22 watts for 0.1 seconds (this is important when calculating any radiative heating on Earth--there will be some afterglow but it won't get hotter than this). 

The initial impact would be visible as a very bright silent flash, something like a camera flash at arm's length. To calculate how much heating Earth would experience in W/m^2 (watts per square meter) _if all of that energy was perfectly converted into EM radiation and emitted equally in every direction_, we take the visible area of the searing-hot matter bubble created in the 0.1 seconds of that initial impact (let's say it has a radius of 5 km), square it, divide it by the square of the distance to the moon, and multiply it by the W/m^2 of the explosion--which will be something like 8x10^22 W / 4 * pi * 5km^2. That's 45108 W/m^2  (watts per square meter) for 0.1 seconds. 

But it's not all going to become radiation, is it? A large portion of that kinetic energy will remain kinetic energy, heaving millions of tonnes of molten rock into suborbital arcs surrounding the impact site, or spreading across the Moon's surface as a shockwave. A large portion of the thermal energy will be conducted away and dissipate more slowly. So let's apply a multiplier--a total guess--because I really don't know how the kinetic vs thermal energy dissipation would break down. I'm going to say 10% of the energy of the impact would be radiated into space. I think that's probably high. That adjusts the received wattage down to 4510 W/m^2 .

To put that in perspective, our upper atmosphere receives 1366.1 W/m^2 from the Sun, constantly. So for 0.1 seconds, it would receive just over four times that, falling off quickly. You might experience it as a passing sensation of warmth on your face. I don't think it's going to set anything on fire, but I would water the lawn beforehand anyway.

It would create a significant new crater on the moon--something the size of Tycho crater perhaps, a molten pit the color of fresh-blown glass rimmed in red and crowned by long radiant streams of molten matter that cool as they drift slowly back to the surface. The lunar surface would experience the pitter-patter of small secondary impacts for hours.

Over the days to come we would experience a meteor shower--the ejecta that reached lunar escape velocity in that initial explosion would find itself in a range of Earth orbits, each piece having an apogee something like the Moon's and various perigees with relation to Earth. Some of those perigees would cross the atmosphere. Our satellites might have to deal with the threat of temporary moonlets (from sand-grain sized to a few centimeters across) until the Moon eventually swept its orbit clear again. It might be difficult to tell the difference between the meteor shower originating from the lunar impact and the meteor shower originating from the comet's tail. 

(There may be no meteor shower at all, depending on where the comet hits the moon, and at what angle. In the worst case scenario, the comet hits the Moon very obliquely in a retrograde direction relative to the Moon's orbit. This would cause the greatest amount of ejecta to reach escape velocity, and it would then be in a variety of sub-lunar orbits around Earth.)",2015-07-10 20:41:33+00:00,csz01b5,1.0,t3_3ctn5q,9541.0,space

2435,"At closest approach (12,500km), New Horizons (as far as I remember, 2.7m on its longest side) will take up 0.044 arcseconds of Pluto's sky. That's very small, but your eyes would resolve it as a moving dot if it were reflecting enough light. (Your eye's power to resolve features at that scale is limited, but its power to pick up photons is just fine).

A fun coincidence: that's nearly exactly the same apparent angular size as the star Betelgeuse.

The question becomes would New Horizons reflect enough light to trigger the cells of my retinas into action? Pluto is far from the Sun. If we imagined New Horizons was a 2.5m^2 mirror disc at 45 degrees to the sun, would enough photons reach you? I'll try to work it out...

The mean solar irradiance at Pluto's orbit is estimated to be about 0.878 W/m2 (watts per square meter). (I grabbed that from an old-ish source but it should give us a rough idea.) If New Horizons were a perfect mirror, it would be re-emitting 2.2 W (0.878 W/m2 * 2.5 m2) of blackbody radiation. We then apply the same formula used to calculate the mean solar irradiance to calculate the 'mean New Horizons irradiance' at Pluto's surface. I get 6.27×10^-8 W/m2 ((0.892m / 12500km) * 0.878 W/m2). That's 0.0000000627 watts for every square meter of surface.

**Record scratch!**

I made a mistake there. The correct value is (0.892^2 m / 12500000^2 m) * 0.878 W/m2, or 4.471×10^-15 W/m^2 --four orders of magnitude lower. I missed that the radius and distance terms need to be squared before they are divided. Thanks to /u/throwaway_MZ3Ji8yc for the correction. 

My old result (which was a resounding 'yes you can see it') was essentially for the same reflector at just 110 km above Pluto's surface. As a sanity check, it makes perfect sense that you would be able to see a satellite at 110km--that's lower than LEO, and you can see LEO satellites any clear night you like. 

Now I'll put this corrected value through the calculation to see what happens. I'm not entirely certain that the result will be 'no, you can't see it'--although 12500km is further away than LEO, it's only about a third as far as geosynchronous Earth orbits, and there's very little atmospheric scattering to contend with. On the other hand, we're much further from the Sun. 

Now to convert that to photons-per-second. The energy emitted by the sun is not all visible light, obviously. But as an approximation I will begin with the mean wavelength of a photon emitted by the sun--from one source, I get 500 nm. Good old Wolfram Alpha tells me one photon with a wavelength of 500nm is worth 3.973×10^-19 joules of energy. Joules are just watts * seconds, so we can say that Pluto's surface is receiving 4.471×10^-15 J/m2 of New Horizons' reflected light every second, or about 11,253 photons per m^2!

Now we apply this to the area of the Belladonnic human pupil--we get about 0.565 photons arriving at the eye every second.

Dang. Not enough. The retinal-excitation experiments I'm basing this lower threshold upon were based on flashes, and this is a sustained, moving source, but it's not enough. Perhaps it would be just about visible if the universe beyond the solar system was empty of stars, the hugeness of Charon wasn't overloading your eyeballs with glare, and your eyeballs were about five times the size.",2015-07-10 18:04:01+00:00,csytmms,2.0,t1_csypsza,5740.0,space
2436,"Touching the Void worked as a movie because it was a human story. It made money because it had a low budget. Rovers recording lunar landscapes would be nice but it's not a movie, and the budget for just one would be higher than any movie ever made. How did I work that out?

Let's do a quick budget: A SpaceX Falcon Heavy will be able to take 6400 kg to a Geosynchronous transfer orbit for 90 million. That's a good competitive price. They don't yet give a price/weight for a trans-lunar injection, but if they used the same Merlin 1D upper stage with a fixed weight budget (more weight given over to fuel for an added 1.6km/s of delta-V) you will have perhaps 1000 kg remaining for your descent module + fuel + rover. 

You could consider reusing the engine from the transfer stage as the engine for the lander stage (jettisoning the tanks that held the fuel for the transfer stage, or carrying them all the way to the moon), but now we're very much non-standard and prices have just skyrocketed. 

If you used something like the Apollo Descent Propulsion System, the module plus fuel is going to require about 620kg of your remaining mass, with 440 kg for your rover and any mechanism to detach your rover, roll it off the lander, etc. The good news is, that's feasible! The bad news is, nobody makes Apollo Descent Propulsion Systems anymore. Costs just went up quite a bit.

(Perhaps other landing modules become feasible as you're not carrying humans--you could talk to the Chinese about building another Chang'e lander, as they have the tools and expertise still hanging around. It's impossible to give you a number for the cost however.)

But let's say we can get there for 500 million.

Rovers are slow (they need to be cautious!) A 20km trip between a couple of neighboring craters may take months or years. It would take thousands of rovers thousands of years to map the moon this way. 

I think a better (and cheaper!) mission for your needs would be an orbiter with a specialized camera and a very low orbit. Off-the-shelf movie cameras won't work as our low, low orbit will be at about 1.6 km/s and the shutter speed necessary to capture ground detail at that velocity will be very high. You won't be able to roll right up to Armstrong's footprints but you'll be able to discern detail in the landing sites.

It would be _interesting!_ I would tune in! But it's not going to gather anything like 500 million in ad revenue.

2439,"True geostationary orbits have an inclination of zero. It takes fuel to maintain a true geostationary orbit, as satellites are perturbed constantly by the sun and moon (remember that the Earth is tilted with respect to the Sun). If allowed to wander, a satellite will drift into an inclined orbit (problematic) and its orbital period will also change to become greater than/less than 24 hours, causing its ground position to move over time (far more problematic). Satellites that are in inclined geosynchronous orbits will appear to sweep back and forth over the same part of the equator--[look at the map of the ground position here](http://www.n2yo.com/satellite/?s=15678). Sometimes this inclined geosynchronous orbit is still acceptable because ground stations can track the satellite throughout the day, so controllers focus on keeping the 24 hour orbital period at the cost of keeping inclination at zero, extending a satellite's useful life.

There are a number of satellites that have been boosted to graveyard orbits that start 235km+ above the geostationary band. You can see that their ground position will migrate over time because their orbital period is not equal to 24h, [like this one](http://www.n2yo.com/satellite/?s=17083). They have naturally wandered into inclined orbits as they are not under active control.

Other objects in that geosynchronous band might never have been in a true geostationary orbit in the first place--many launch sites are above/below the equator and so the initial orbit would be inclined. It takes more fuel to circularize and correct that inclination than it does to simply circularize the orbit. I don't have a good historical example of this (maybe someone can find one, I just haven't looked!) 

You will notice that the geosynchronous band is generally less dense above the Pacific due to the hugeness of the ocean and the lack of civilization there (sorry, Hawaiians!). Apart from that I don't see the same macro feature that you're seeing--I see a fairly even spread of inclinations on the geosynchronous band above/below the equator.

2443,"Weightlessness is not the absence of mass (or even the absence of gravity--'weightless' astronauts in orbit are still deep in Earth's gravity well, just in a state of constant, mostly drag-free freefall). As objects still have the same mass, it takes exactly the same amount of force to impart the same acceleration. In space you avoid the drag of the atmosphere, and because you're already in orbit you can afford to take your time and use lower thrust engines to raise/lower/otherwise alter your orbit, or even leave Earth orbit altogether.

Propellors have a fairly low operational ceiling--they need the thick atmosphere to push against. Jet engines can operate higher, and specialised ramjets/scramjets can operate even higher (as they go much faster and gulp more air per second). 

There have been serious considerations for launching cheap rockets into orbit from huge, lighter-than-air platforms. The Pegasus system launches light rockets into orbit from beneath a jet plane. But the most important part is always that rocket--you need to go fast to enter orbit, and you need to be able to accelerate in a vacuum or near vacuum. Rockets work in space because they carry their own 'reaction mass'--the stuff accelerated in the opposite direction to motion. Acceleration in space ultimately requires something that behaves like a rocket (based on what we know in 2015 anyway) or behaves like a sail (but that's just complicating things!) 

To answer your core question--why not go slowly?--you could get into space as slowly as you liked if you had enough fuel.

Six engines would allow rapid acceleration in any direction without rotation. Rotation could be achieved by thrust vectoring. 

Do away with the shell altogether though. Low mass and rapid acceleration is the order of the day. I'd go bare-bones, with six engines built around a gun and just enough reaction mass for the typical encounter.

2447,"Low Earth Orbit requires a velocity of about 7.8 km/s. Losses to gravity and atmospheric drag mean that a rocket requires an extra 1.5-2.0 km/s of delta V (a handy measure of a rocket's ability to change it's velocity). So in total, 9.8 km/s of delta V is typically required, meaning that 21% of the velocity budget of a launch to LEO is lost to gravity/atmospheric drag.

This is why rockets perform a 'gravity turn' towards the horizontal as soon as they are beyond the thickest part of the atmosphere. If you burned horizontally from the start (on a long rail system for example) you would lose more velocity to air resistance than you lose to gravity by burning 'up' for a while before making your turn. 

On the other hand, if rockets burned upwards (also called radially) until they were at LEO altitude, they would minimize time spent fighting the atmosphere, but the cost in gravity drag would be enormous, and they would still need to impart 7.8km/s before falling back to Earth.

2450,"If any of our deep space probes are ever seen again, it seems vastly more likely that human eyes (or the cameras of our AI descendants) will be doing the seeing. We're the closest intelligent species, and (realistically) we're the only intelligent species with _any idea of where those probes are_. 

A long-lived alien empire with billions of ships evenly distributed throughout our limb of the galaxy would still be unlikely to accidentally bump into our probes. They would need to be actively searching. I can't imagine any E.T. telescope tech resolving them from the glare of the sun, or finding them later in the dark of interstellar space. Perhaps the RTGs will still be anomalously warm for a while.

On the other hand I'd guess that people will be guessing at the locations of those probes for thousands of years, and someone with the right kind of money and sentimentality might go looking for them. They might make useful technology demonstrators for future telescopes.

Barring the intervention of intelligences familiar or alien, the probes will drift with the rotation of the galaxy for millions of years, perhaps deflected by encounters with the sphere of influence of one star or another. Permanent capture by another star is an unlikely scenario. A close encounter with an object with a thin atmosphere or some impossibly-lucky series of gravity assists around some extrasolar planets might be enough to capture the probes into some stable orbit. More likely (but still unlikely) is the probe's destruction during a brush with some other star.

Maybe the collision with Andromeda might be enough to fling them out of the galaxy altogether. Eventually, over hundreds of millions of years, they will break down into tiny debris clouds due to metal fatigue and the natural migration of atoms out of the polymer and lattice structures of their various plastics and alloys. The decay of the RTGs may help to speed this process along.",2015-07-05 21:14:24+00:00,cst5hrs,1.0,t3_3c74fl,24661.0,space

Let's be very optimistic and assume that humans will still have a technological civilisation, that they'll remember to look for the signal, and that they'll be interested in the data. The quickest way for science to have access to data from an interstellar probe is for us to _send it now._

""But we might find a better propulsion tech in the next 100 years, something that will get us to another star in 500 years."" Great! Send another probe! But in the meantime, let's think about what we can do with what we have available.

Controlling the probe from Earth will be a huge challenge with today's tech because of the limits of radio transmission. Perhaps we would need 1 probe and 99 evenly-spaced signal repeaters (and that's very optimistic!) The signal repeaters would be almost as complex and expensive as the probe itself. Then there's the question of how to direct the probe when it arrives. Think of the signal delays! It will need to be mostly autonomous. 

A better way would be to send off 100 totally autonomous probes to the same system, program them to seek planets and make observations (with different teams working on a range of algorithms, on a range of chipsets), and give them enough fuel to _return to Earth orbit_. It's going to take 2000 years now, but there's a huge added benefit; if civilization falls apart in the meantime, the data will be available as soon as people figure out rockets and computers again, giving that new civilization a great head-start.

2476,"The habitable zone of our sun is thought to begin at 0.95 AU--so we wouldn't have long (about 20 days, according to /u/throwaway_MZ3Ji8yc's badass chart) before we were technically outside the habitable zone. But the habitable zone is only meaningful on long time scales. It says ""if Earth formed here, would we expect it to be habitable?"" as opposed to ""if Earth was suddenly dropped here, would it be habitable?"". In our case everything is happening very quickly, so there's no time for the oceans to totally 'boil off'. (They'll eventually start to boil alright! They'll saturate the atmosphere with water, and that water will begin to split in the upper atmosphere and Earth will lose hydrogen to the solar wind. But that process would take billions of years. The oceans are a massive heatsink.)

More meaningful will be the amount of solar radiation Earth experiences--at some point the atmosphere will be too hot to sustain life. The people who live longest will be those with access to active cooling--solar powered air conditioning would work for a while, as long as we could deal with the humidity. Think of it this way; if we found an alien world with water and a perfect atmosphere, but that atmosphere was a hothouse with the average temperature of hot coffee, we'd probably count ourselves lucky and try to colonize it. The survivors by day 30 or so would start to feel like colonists on an alien world.

The atmosphere will also expand with the heat, reducing the availability of oxygen at ground level. I'm not sure if that will be a problem if it's too hot to breathe anyway.

It will get very wet. I'd expect lots of hot rain and hemisphere-sized hurricanes as the atmosphere becomes more energetic. That might be a blessing--it might be enough to keep the wildfires at bay and raise Earth's albedo a bit, cooling us down for a while. 

Low, sheltered ground somewhere near whatever pole is furthest from the sun would be your best bet for survival. Let's say it's winter in the Antarctic and you have an outpost there. Lucky you. Start piling ice and rock around your building (or better still, just bury it). You will need an air conditioner, which is something they probably don't bother with in Antarctica. The wind will get warm but you will be safe from direct solar radiation as long as the sun doesn't rise. 

The last people alive by day 50 or so (0.5 au) will be deep in mines or huddled at the poles. The hot wind will have flattened forests and whipped up tsunamis around the world. There will be major eruptions of long-frozen methane from the poles--enough to kick off a disastrous greenhouse effect if Earth was around long enough for it to matter.

I really don't know when the air will become totally unbreathable, but at some point people will need to isolate themselves from the atmosphere to wait out the end. With the right equipment you can isolate a shelter for months, so that's not a problem. 

The tides will go crazy. Eventually the oceans will join to become a wave that follows the Sun as the Earth turns beneath it. This will lengthen Earth's day by a few seconds. It won't be enough to tidally-lock Earth to the Sun in the few days remaining. The magma layer will begin to do the same, bulging Sunwards, pushing through fault lines. The ground will quake constantly, slowly liquefying. Volcanoes will spew ash and CO2 into the wet atmosphere, darkening it, increasing the heat absorption. Earth will become fractionally egg-shaped. More or less everyone will be dead by then. 

I guess if you could accelerate the ISS to an orbit that kept them over the dark side of the Earth (L2 Lagrangian point for example) and give them a nuclear reactor for power, a few people might survive the great and final rollercoaster all the way to Earth's spectacular immolation and stripping-bare in the corona. They would be riding in a wake of hot atmosphere then, like the tail of a comet. 

Earth is rotating; the matter that makes up Earth has quite a bit of angular momentum. In the final days the Sun's rapidly increasing gravity will weaken Earth's downward pull on its upper layers, so Earth will unspool spectacularly into a disc of molten matter.

It so happens that the curve looks like a segment of a circle, but there are other curves that would miss the Sun as well. Stick enough segments of a circle together and you have a circle. 

Another way to imagine it (hats of to Newton here): think of a cannon mounted on a stand about ten kilometers from the surface of the moon, pointed horizontally. The cannon is fired and the ball begins to fall under the influence of the moon's gravity, following a smooth curve to the moon's surface below. (It will travel with a constant horizontal velocity in the absence of air resistance, but it will accelerate towards the ground under gravity.) Pack enough gunpowder into the cannon and the ball could have so much horizontal velocity that the curve of the fall is shallower than the curve of the moon itself! It would swing right around the moon and (in a perfect world) hit the cannon from behind. Move the cannon out of the way in time and the ball would essentially orbit indefinitely.

The best simulations show that the kind of impacts that create moons are of the 'total obliteration' sort.

Maybe the narrative is more complex than one impact creating all the moons anyway: if we started with the Pluto/Charon system (created in a total-obliteration-type impact by current models) then Charon might have been able to gravity-assist some of the ejecta from that later, lesser impact into a stable orbit.

All of that matter will return to Pluto. It will rain back down over the hours/days that follow. I can't put any of that matter in a stable orbit with a single acceleration, nomatter how large. (It either lands back on Pluto or reaches escape velocity.) Right? No new moons can result from this.

Or...

Can gravitational interactions in the hot mist of rocks cause some of the ejecta to fall back to Pluto while exchanging velocity with other ejecta, so that the lucky ejecta ends up in a stable orbit? Even a single pebble? 

Could some of the ejecta cloud exchange some velocity with Charon, accelerating the ejecta cloud into orbit, drawing Charon inwards? (I'd imagine so.)

You could accelerate until your electricity ran out--your reactor went dead or you were too far from a star for solar panels to work.

But let's imagine you have a bank of plutonium RTGs that will put out 1kW for ten years, and a 1000kg probe. You just want to _go real fast_ to see how fast you can get in 10 years.

Let's ask Wolfram Alpha: [(0.1N / 1000kg) * 10 years](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%280.1N+%2F+1000kg%29+*+10+years) = 31500 m/s. 

So over a 10-year period, you would get a 1000kg probe up to twice the speed of New Horizons, for example. In that time you would travel 4.97 billion km.

If you could engineer a 450-year RTG and bring the whole craft in under 1000kg, you could travel 1.03 light years in 450 years. 

5.26 light years in a mere millennium! 

Make the EmDrive one order of magnitude more powerful (1N/kW), or your RTG + engine + probe payload one order of magnitude lighter, and you'd really be getting somewhere. In that same 450 years you could go 10 light years. You could accelerate halfway to Alpha Centauri (202 years) then decelerate for the same time period again to be captured by the system. 

One more order of magnitude (10N/kW) and you could have a probe in orbit around Alpha Centauri in just 128 years. With a 10x lighter craft (now we're in star wisp territory) the journey could be completed in just 40 years. 

Or, if we pretend that the acceleration scales up with power input and doesn't just melt the EmDrive, drop the RTG and bring in a tiny thorium reactor putting out 1 mW. Now even with the first iteration of the EmDrive and a 1000kg craft (I guess most of which is reactor and radiator mass now) you can get to Alpha Centauri in 40 years. Now you're one order of magnitude of EmDrive performance away from a 12-year trip, with a peak velocity of 2/3rds of the speed of light...

At that point I have to wonder: taking time dilation into account, when should you start decelerating? I guess the answer is always 'halfway'. I have to imagine that if time on your craft is slowing towards 0.74 seconds per second (relative to the POV of an observer on Earth) over a period of years, your EmDrive slowly becomes less effective (again relative to an observer on Earth) so your peak velocity will be lower/actual transit time will be greater.

An equatorial orbit above the highest point on the equator would work. From Wikipedia: 

&gt;The highest point on the Equator is at the elevation of 4,690 metres (15,387 ft), at 0°0′0″N 77°59′31″W, found on the southern slopes of Volcán Cayambe [summit 5,790 metres (18,996 ft)] in Ecuador. 

With no atmosphere the oceans would boil off into space, and the tectonic plates would rise in response, so you should add some safety factor to that minimum height before you set off on your eternal vigil on the Last Rocket Ever.

2508,"Okay--to answer this question we'd need to remove a few compounding factors. Let's say the planet has no atmosphere so we can ignore the increased density at the surface, the increased drag. Let's choose a powerful modern engine (one I can get a thrust value for!), the SpaceX Raptor, with a thrust of 2,300 kN and an Isp of 380s, lifting just itself and its fuel tank into orbit. We would need to decide on a target orbital velocity--say 7800m/s--the velocity would remain the same but the orbital altitude would change as the gravitational parameter increases. 

We are also going to imagine a fixed amount of velocity is lost to gravity on ascent (let's say, 1500m/s). We're also not going to do any staging, which would otherwise allow us to use a high-thrust engine followed by a lighter high-specific-impulse engine (which is what you'd do in real life, but it complicates things vastly).

So our theoretical rocket looks like this: 

**Rocket dry mass:** 5000kg (engine, plumbing, structure, electronics, empty tanks, no mucking about with an aerodynamic shell...this is the sweetest rocket ever built) 

**Engine specific impulse:** 380s

**Engine exhaust velocity:** 380s * g0 = 3727m/s

We want a delta-V (total velocity change) of 9300m/s , so we need to work out how much fuel we need. Time to consult the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation...it says that the wet mass will need to be 60627kg. The theoretical rocket has a starting thrust-to-weight ratio of 2,300 kN / (60627kg * 9.807m/s)...3.86 or so...which is going to work just fine! 

So how high can that gravitational acceleration value (9.807m/s) get before our TWR gets too low to allow us to take off at all? Let's arbitrarily call our minimum TWR 1.1. That means that our maximum acceleration due to gravity is 34.48m/s--about 3.5 times that of Earth. 

But I'm ignoring the increased velocity losses due to gravity on ascent (you'll be burning upwards for longer), which means you'd need more fuel to achieve the same orbital velocity, which means your TWR would be untenable...

It also might make more sense to aim for a fixed orbital height (say 100km) rather than a fixed velocity, and accept that your required orbital velocity will increase as the gravitational parameter of our theoretical planet increases. That further reduces the ceiling for our magical single-staged rocket.

Time for a graphing calculator/someone who knows more than me.

Other compounding factors to consider: 

- As gravity increases, you'll need stronger fuel tanks and a stronger, heavier structure.
- The atmosphere, of course. The same atmosphere will be denser (and thus apply more drag), but the scale height will be lower, so you could find a lower stable orbit...
- Can you stage your rocket? If so, you could end up with a single ball bearing in orbit and call it a success.
- Can you go nuclear (a reactor heating a chemical propellant)?
- There are theoretically better chemical engines if you don't care about ascending to space on a toxic vapor trail. A lithium-flouride-hydrogen engine was tested in the 60's, with an exhaust velocity in the 5000m/s range. 
- On your smooth, airless planet you could launch directly for the horizon on a rail, achieve a very low orbit with minimum gravity drag, then gradually increase your orbital height (in an unhurried fashion) with an ion engine or something along those lines.

So--using rockets available today--if Earth's surface gravity was 2x greater, changing nothing else, could we still achieve orbit? Remember there are other compounding factors--you can imagine that the atmospheric density would be greater, but the scale height of the atmosphere would be less, meaning that you could orbit at a lower altitude... 

To answer this question we would need to fix some of the variables--engine specific impulse, atmospheric density, etc. Then you could discover the maximum value of the gravitational parameter for a given engine and atmospheric model. ",2015-06-30 14:04:28+00:00,csnivn4,4.0,t1_csnil22,569.0,space

p: We know the surface pressure, so we'll need to work out surface atmospheric density.

Density (r) is related to pressure (P) the gas constant (R) and temperature (T): r = p / R T
We'll take the gas constant for Nitrogen (296.8 J/kg.K) and the mean temperature of 50K. Surface pressure is 0.3 pascals.
 
  r(surface) = 0.3 Pa / (296.8 J/kg.K * 50K) = 2.02×10^-5 kg/m^3

 The scale height is 60km, and your altitude is about 4km, so we can multiply r(surface) by 1/e^(4km / 60km) to get r. _I think._


e: Eccentricity. I'm going to assume you are blasting through Pluto's SOI in almost a straight line, deflected only slightly by the encounter. I'll call it 2.5.


Plugging it into Wolfram Alpha...

dV = ((2.2 m * 2.7 m * 1.0) / 401 kg) * ((0.0202 * (1/e^(4 km / 60 km)))g/m^3) * sqrt(2 * pi * 871 km^3 s^−2) * ((1 + 2.5) / sqrt(2.5)) * sqrt(60 km)

dV = **355.1 m/s**


A drop in the velocity ocean, but pretty respectable! 

Next exercise: what area of a parachute would you need to get rid of your relative velocity?

By plugging values into the equation...you can get rid of 14.5 km/s by buzzing Pluto at that altitude with an impossibly-strong parachute with an 84 meter radius (assuming a drag coefficient of 1.75), as long as you can get it to weigh 1000 kilos or less.",2015-06-29 10:31:10+00:00,csm9axw,1.0,t3_3bg9hp,39822.0,KerbalSpaceProgram

It'll probably take 30 years to work through it all. You'd get a better science output in a shorter period of time if you parallelize the processing of the same data across a few labs, even with a bunch of unqualified bumpkin scientists.

Edit: also, go look for the ScienceAlert mod--it will be ridiculously useful for you. Be prepared to do multiple EVAs to take experiments from the apparatus and store them in the science lab, which means the apparatus can be used again straight away.

e.g. Let's say you have a craft with a thermometer and a lander capsule, that's it. You enter Eve SOI, you get an alert--take a reading.

2537,"Let's see some pictures!

Some thoughts: 

- You might be going too fast too low (do you start out with a lot of SRBs? What's your initial thrust-to-weight ratio like? If you don't know, it's time to go get the KER mod which will help immensely). Try turning down the thrust on your SRBs so that they are carrying you at a gentle 200-250m/s as you are crossing that 10,000 meter point. It's logical enough--going too fast through the thickest part of the atmosphere will increase the aerodynamic forces applied your craft. 

- Try adding six fins instead of four, just to see what happens. This will give you more drag towards the rear of the rocket, which should keep the nose pointing up (although you can be 'over stable', which makes it difficult to turn until you get to the thinner part of the atmosphere, which gives you a less efficient ascent curve--more work to do to circularize your orbit when you get up there)

- Is your rocket flexing, then wobbling in response to the bend? Consider adding a few struts across those decoupler joints. Also, turn down the gimballing on your engines to 10-15%--is it better now?

- People say 'follow the prograde marker'--this is correct but not great advice until you already know how to launch in a smooth curve from 'straight up' to 'pointing at the horizon'. Manually trailing somewhere just behind the prograde marker, ending up pointing right at the horizon line is easier to pull off. Really you are _managing_ that prograde marker yourself--you smoothly lower it to meet the horizon the course of the launch. It's just _energetically ideal_ when you can do that _and_ point your craft along the prograde marker from start to finish--more energy is going into your orbit instead of fighting gravity.

Once you have the basics worked out, the same rules apply to any scale of rocket (you just need proportionately bigger fins!). I haven't had to move fuel around to make a launch work yet. Just make sure your rocket acts like a dart--heavy and smooth at the top, with a proportionate amount of drag at the bottom to keep the top pointed along the velocity vector. Now you are just balancing stability and control/fuel efficiency. Stiffen with struts where necessary (but also don't overdo it--more than 3 or 4 symmetrically placed struts between each stage is too many).

2562,"Are you controlling the craft from something (a pod, a docking port) in line with the center of mass and pointing 'up'? I'm using FAR and haven't encountered any significant weirdness. I just landed a very weird craft (a captured 5m docking port from a contract!) and it behaved ok. 

Could there be some asymmetry applying a force to your craft that your SAS is correcting for? ",2015-06-16 20:00:59+00:00,cs8qly5,1.0,t3_3a2lev,3347.0,KerbalSpaceProgram
2563,"Anyone who imagines this is going to be as expansive or detailed as the original needs to understand a thing or two about how games are produced now vs 1996/1997. I'm terrified this is going to be 65 hours of empty, on-rails bullshit like FFXIII. I'll feel better when I see what they do with FFXV. 

Those beautiful pre-rendered backdrops in the original were relatively quick and cheap to make in comparison to the same environment in full 3D. So they'll cut, and cut, and cut just so that the environments they do put in the game can be seen from every angle. All of those little hidden corners of the game that you only found on your 4th playthrough will be gone. 

Voiceover will replace text. With text dialogs, you could afford to have all the hundreds of little interactions in Midgar and beyond. Now you'll have three or four voiced story characters and everyone else will complain generically in five voices when you bump into them. 

And about those character models (parroting their one line about how the train is late every time you pass)--every single one will need to be lovingly crafted down to the last wrinkle, which means there will be a budget for about 15 NPCs in the whole game.

That's my fear anyway. That, and soulless techno loops replacing the original music. 

What the people of 2015 might see as flaws in the 20-year-old game are in fact a huge part of its charm. Do you really imagine hi-rez Cloud getting into a bathtub with five hi-rez buff dudes in the Honey Bee Inn? Do you really think you're going to see that? That's not cool enough for 2015 (or May 2019 when it's released to the western world).

Sigh. This guy _are_ sick.",2015-06-16 15:39:53+00:00,cs8fwy2,1.0,t3_39zlp4,49496.0,videos

2566,"The Community Tech Tree has a fixed layout, mods fill in the gaps. I'm currently playing career mode with NFT + Interstellar extended + KAX + Infernal Robotics + KAS/KIS (which I think integrates to CTT, I'm not 100% sure) + KW Rocketry + SpaceY Heavy lifters, and most nodes of the tree have something in 'em. 

(I guess TAC Life Support fills out the lower part of the tree, but I haven't tried it yet). 

P.S: this is a pretty fun mod combination and everything is still a massive challenge. I wish NFT and Interstellar were better integrated (at least the heatsink parts--let me use those pretty NFT radiators on Interstellar reactors!) but usually they have very little crossover anyway.",2015-06-16 09:38:14+00:00,cs878dm,2.0,t1_cs60q05,177143.0,KerbalSpaceProgram
2567,"No landings or orbits at least. This sounds like a job for xenon gas and gravity assists! The Mun and Minmus will be easy with the right alignment, and Minmus can throw you out of Kerbin SOI...then a burn to get to Eve, gravity assist at Eve to get near Moho, gravity assist back outwards from Moho, enjoy a long relaxing burn to Duna, gravity assist from Ike...you may even need to refuel at some point which will require either a rendezvous with a fuel barge in Kerbol SOI, or slowing down to an orbit around (for example) Ike--I'm not sure which would be more costly, dV-wise.
