1) I spawn in as a defender. We're already on the last map of the Operation. The opposition has two batallians left. My team defend by throwing their bodies at one point at a time, and we're only ever one smart infiltrator away from losing a sector. I always seem to be the one who meets ten enemies running up a side street. I see lots of blue dots spread randomly over the map, some apparently looking away from the action. My squad make no apparent attempt to survive when they are down to one man. Nobody knows what to do when they see a tank.

2) I spawn in as an Attacker. We're on the first or second section of the first map and we are already down a batallian. My team attack by throwing their bodies at both points at a steady drip-drip rate, conveniently spread out for the enemy. The enemy are free to flank us as nobody looks left or right from the moment they spawn to the moment they die running in the open towards the flag. I make some kind of headway by flanking and clearing a bunker with a Hellriegel killstreak and then 'WE LOST' pops up.

I never quit guys, I'm not that guy. But holy hell so many of these operations start out hopelessly and you can see nobody is going to get their shit together. It's maddening.

He was useless as a spawn point, he was useless as a scout...so I went into the squad menu and kicked him. I'm sure he probably didn't notice. Within a couple of minutes the squad was full again--we were joined by an assault player who pushed forward with us and played the objectives.

Later on Monte Grappa I noticed the same behaviour from another scout--camping back beyond E for the first quarter of the match. I kicked him and we soon had another decent squadmate.

We were the Ottoman Empire. In the first third of the match we held points B through to G. We were about two hundred points ahead of our opponents--they couldn't get a foothold. 

Then at the halfway point, B/C/D started going red while E and F stayed blue. My squad refused to leave the walls of their precious fortress...but at the same time they *left the field gun unmanned* so British tanks had free reign of the field all the way to the fortress gates. They were watching it all through their scopes, standing three feet away from the field gun.

I spawned on my squad and took control of the field gun, taking out the two bumbling tank crews who stayed just within my range in about 30 seconds. Then ran to B spamming GO GO GO. But no, I was alone out there apart from one or two intrepid teammates (though all of them hung back from the actual capture area...wouldn't want to irritate the British forces!)

The British took G uncontested. I would arrive at the flags and find them empty--or maybe contested by one medic. Then a squad of Brits would push up and retake the flag, kill me, and I had a loooong run back into the action from my useless squad (who were hiding along the walls of the fortress, 'defending' their precious E and F while the enemy roared ahead and took a comfortable lead).

Maybe *once* a squadmate followed me out to take B for all of ten seconds before another tank rolled up untroubled by guns or bombs of any sort...I took out two tanks with limpet mines just following them around, re-stocking my own ammo as I went. *These things are not hard to counter.* 

So we held E and F until the thirty blue dots clustered around the fort managed to LOSE E AND F to about three guys. Then in their despair they all abandoned the fort and what do you know, B/C/D/G went blue again. 

But it was all too late.

Hopefully they all learned some kind of lesson...but I doubt it.

A few months ago I started a keto diet and my dreams have really stepped up their game (intense, vivid, often lucid dreams nightly). 

Last night I found myself in what looked like a remote Irish town. Like a lot of towns in Ireland this was one wide main street with buildings to either side, and maybe a few offshoot streets.

When the dream started out (or at least where my memory starts out) I had to attend an interview in order to be welcome in the town. Success in the interview would mean I would get a job of some sort and I would be allocated a house. I walked into the town hall and it was about there that the dream passed control over to me.

I had a look around. The stairs and walls looked to be in a state of disrepair, badly worn or broken. I navigated the town hall to the interview room, where I was asked to sit outside. I remember the plastic texture of the seat, the pale light streaming in the window at the end of that corridor, the sound of footsteps on the creaking boards.

The interviewer (a middle-aged woman, with grey hair tied back and a thick woolen cardigan) opened the door to her office and asked me to join her. I took a seat in her office and she gave me some background of the town...sadly I don't recall the details but one thing stood out. ""You don't need to worry,"" she said, ""this isn't purgatory."" 

I'm not religious, and I've had vivid dreams of very stable and recurring dream-locales my whole life, so the idea that the town was some kind of *religious purgatory* would never occur to me. It's interesting that the interviewer came out with it.

Evidently I did well enough in the interview. It was a series of questions and answers...moral questions, mostly. Her questions were more than just verbal, I would *see* the situation play out, and my choices would effect the outcome. At the end she seemed happy to allow me to stay in the town, and offered me some kind of law enforcement role. I agreed to this, and she pointed me in the direction of my new house. 

I was in a semi-lucid state at this point--aware that this was not a normal physical environment and probably a dream, but not aware enough to simply go flying off and leave the dream behind. 

Like the rest of the town, my new property was in a state of disrepair. It was an old house and a large barn surrounded by overgrown shrubs and tall grass and a steel fence that looked like it had once been very sturdy.

At this point the sky was gloomy and growing dark, like a low stormcloud was sitting right over me. I raised my arms and shouted ""let there be light!"" in a halfhearted way, to no effect (in plenty of dreams I've been able to drag the sun across the sky if I wanted to).

I entered the house. The interior was damp and unloved, and the decor was last updated in the early 90's. Everything needed a serious scrubbing. Upstairs there was a dusty bedroom with an unmade bed, the sheets spotted with mildew--it looked like the previous resident had disappeared about 20 years ago and the house had been locked up since.

Then I heard a clanging outside and went to investigate. A massive catlike animal was attacking my steel gate, hugely muscled and dark-furred. In the dream I thought ""holy shit, it's a smilodon"" (when I woke later I had to google smilodon to make sure it was a real word). This thing had the bulk and shape of a sabre-toothed cat with a face that was closer to a mandrill ape. I pulled my front door shut, then shut a sturdy interior door, then ran upstairs to look for a decent hiding-place. I found a door leading to a narrow attic room, and found an attic window. I opened the window and leaned out to shout abuse at the creature, hoping it would leave when sufficiently insulted.

Well, that was it. My wife woke me at that point.",Dreams,"Interviewed to live in a small town, interviewer explains ""this isn't purgatory""",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/53skf9/interviewed_to_live_in_a_small_town_interviewer/

She is currently pregnant and we face the difficult and emotional process of seeking a termination because the sire of her pups turned out to be a schnauzer-corgi-dachshund mix with serious learning difficulties instead of the purebreed we were promised.

This all started in late summer when I casually explained to my brother-in-law that we wanted a litter of pups before Dorothy got too old. Our intention is to keep one or maybe two and gift the others to interested friends from church. We talked about the kind of money that changes hands and he said he knew a guy with a suitable sire through his car detailing business and he could do it for $200. I leaped at the chance and gave him custody of Dorothy the next time she was in heat, along with $200 and $50 for his trouble.

When my brother-in-law returned Dorothy he assured me that the deed had been done, but he was vague about 'the guy' who owned the dog. I explained that I would need to talk to 'the guy' about pedigree papers and he was reticent to give me the necessary information. Eventually I got a name out of my sister-in-law and realized that I knew him as a one-time client of my carpentry &amp; roofing business.

So I called the gentleman and met him at his work, he explained that he had received **no money whatsoever** and thought he was doing a favor for my brother-in-law. He also explained that his dog was heavily miscegenated as previously explained and that it had a serious mental deficiency as well as jaw and joint problems. I saw a picture of this creature that had been in our Dorothy and I nearly fell over. Only my anger kept me going. I stormed off in righteous fury.

I tracked down my brother in law who was out witnessing that afternoon and I pulled him by his collar into the truck. I am not a violent man but this was a serious betrayal of his sister and I, not to mention poor Dorothy, and I was ready to break his teeth for him. I gave him the option of paying us back or organizing and paying for the termination (it's very hard to find a vet in our county equipped to perform abortions and we will probably have to go to the blue state next door). He agreed at the time and said he would pray on it but we haven't seen or heard from him in two weeks and Dorothy is getting fat around the middle.

My wife says I should just turn the other cheek (but she has always had a soft spot for her brother, all the women in his family treat him like a baby.) So now I'm not only out of pocket $250, but I'm going to be out of pocket for Dorothy's procedure AND I need to pay for another pedigree sire before Dorothy gets too old. 

Who is in the wrong here? Did I overreact? Should I let go and let God? I want to hold a family summit to shame him in front of the mother and sisters that fawn over him, but part of me knows that it's more trouble than it's worth. What would you do in my position?

Growing up we had a friend we called Bert. He was a big lanky and skinny dude, pale as a ghost due to his low blood pressure, prone to bouts of narcolepsy. Bert wasn't his real name, just a nickname that had stuck--it was short for Sherbet (pronounced Sher*bert* here), because he would foam at the mouth during his narcoleptic spells. In other words, he was a fantastic source of entertainment for our idiot troupe, and pranking Bert became part of our weekend routine.

He would drift to sleep during the slightest lull in action--sitting still more than ten minutes, basically. The only way he could stay awake was by keeping occupied, so he would walk around a lot, or keep himself busy eating (jerky was his favorite). When he slept he had two modes: he would either nod off and jerk back into consciousness a split second later (no good for pranking), or he would be out cold for maybe five minutes (perfect for pranking). You could tell he was out cold when he drooled.

One day we're playing Fifa '97 at another friend's house. I don't know if you remember Fifa '97 for the PS1 but the loading times were atrocious. After a while we looked over and Bert was slumped into himself, drool pooling in the folds of his coat (he rarely removed his big Manchester United manager's coat). We all agreed that Bert was due a pranking.

We knew we could move Bert around while he slept--an arm here, a leg there. But we'd never fully tested the limits of his tolerance. Two of us took an arm each and another guy took his legs and we lifted him from his chair. Sure enough he remained asleep. We swung him back and forth a bit and still he slumbered. We were amazed.

So *of course* we knew the thing to do would be to carry him upstairs to our friend's sister's bedroom. At first we just wanted him to wake up somewhere weird. Then *we* got weird. Our friend's sister was about four years older than us, something of a hottie, and she worked odd shifts at the local supermarket. We'll call her Jane for the purposes of this retelling, it's close enough. It was mid-evening and we didn't know when exactly Jane would be home, which lent a frisson of terror to the process of undressing Bert.

After we'd stripped him down to his underwear, we slipped him under Jane's big baby-pink quilt and took his clothes downstairs. This should have been enough for us, but the madness had taken us and we knew we were going to push it as far as we could. We took one of Jane's fragrant girly pillows and put a bra and a pair of panties on it, then slipped it under Bert's naked arm.

We skulked back downstairs stifling laughter, waiting for Bert to wake and flee from the room in terror. Five minutes passed, then ten. Usually he would be awake by then. Maybe the comfort of the bed had lulled him into a deeper sleep...

We went up to check on him, and found him in much the same position as we had left him, except now he had an obvious erection that had escaped from the front of his boxers and he had just had a very messy wet dream all over Jane's sheets and pillow. It had darkened an expanding area of the crotch of her panties.

One of the most grim experiences of my life was trying to mop up Bert's cum with a bundle of kitchen paper on the end of a pair of barbecue tongs. We tried to wake him but it was no good, and that awful pale thing of his refused to deflate. Apparently he had no blood pressure problems in *one specific area.* Then we hear keys in the front door and *holy shit Jane is home.*

I'm ashamed to say that I thundered down the stairs and ran out the back door and vaulted over the fence with an athleticism I never knew I had, closely followed by friend number 4, leaving our other friend to deal with Bert, his sister, the panties, and the cummy tongs.

That was a shitshow.

**Edit**: some folk are asking for what happened afterwards, so here's a summary: we ran for a bit then slipped home without passing his street. There was much nervous laughter. We didn't hear about our 'house ban' until two days later when we next saw our friend face to face. He explained that Bert woke in a fugue state just as Jane came upstairs...for a while he had no idea where he was, or why he was sticky, and he reacted to the pillow like it was a severed horse head. 

Jane naturally lost her mind at the state of her room and the cumstained slenderman flailing around in it and it apparently took about an hour to explain the sequence of events to her (my friend said it was all down to me and friend #4, a survival strategy I completely understood). Meanwhile Bert got dressed and got out of there, pleading complete ignorance. When my friend's mother came home, Jane spilled everything to her and Mrs X just blanket-banned us from the house forever. Luckily she was too tired and exasperated to call our parents because I'd still be locked in my room now.

Our friend had to clean everything up, naturally.

When we regrouped Bert was downtrodden and said we'd gone too far, but we soon got him laughing and back on form when we complimented the ridiculous volume of spackle he'd produced, joked that it wasn't the first stranger's load dumped on those sheets, etc etc etc. Juvenile stuff.

**tl;dr**: a narcoleptic friend; a dick that would not bend; a spill we tried to mend; a house ban without end

A flotilla of onlookers have gathered about 1000 AU away to witness the historic event. Some of them are wearing sunglasses and gamma ray sunscreen, while some of the others are laughing at them from the bar. Who's right?

First, our observers record the outpouring of gravity waves increasing in pitch. Then our matter and antimatter singularities merge. 

Presumably at this point they annihilate each other, releasing a vast amount of energy. But the total mass-energy of the system remains the same, right? So we end up with a black hole of the combined mass of the two black holes (minus whatever was lost to gravity waves). Would the event horizon even bulge a little? Would the soup of radiation 'spread out' from some barycenter (still within the event horizon) only to fall back in?

Are the presumptions behind this question even reasonable--is there any difference between a singularity made of conventional matter and one made of antimatter? Should the singularity be considered a kind of mass-energy bucket that forgets the nature of the matter that made it? (Would annihilation occur at all?)

I just spent 6 hours or so defending against trespassers to get my sweet rewards. What a day it was! The area is great--all the way from the winding hill to the tumbledown building. Five stars, would defend with my life again. 

Some pointers for success:

- I was level 31 or so, with a +3 katana. This seems to be average for passersby. I just hung around the tower and was summoned after 30 seconds of running around, sometimes less than that. Sit at the bonfire now and then to reset the wear and tear on your equipment. 

-  If you're not spawned straight into battle, then have patience, let your quarry come to you. You can hide behind the huge trees (or just do what I did and kneel in the open) to observe their equipment, play style, find out if they are a first timer, find out if they have summoned help. You may well be joined by a fellow Watchdog if you wait before rushing in. 

- When it's time to fight, be aggressive and try to panic your opponent into making a mistake. About half the time they will run. 

- There's no shortage of little helpers to bait intruders towards. I found that making wide/confusing circles around someone while drawing them into the water and close to a crab works wonders. Crabs can hurt you with their pounding attack though! If you encounter your quarry in the castle ruins area you'll almost certainly win if they haven't already cleared out the enemies there. If your quarry is accompanied, leading them towards the humanoid heavies can help even the odds. 

- If your quarry panics and runs for the upper bonfire, they may be hoping to summon help. Cut them down before they can. The height here means that a panicked player will sometimes fall to their death, or run below you and give you opportunities for a dropping attack. Fighting in the bonfire area will turn the battle into a fairly even PvP match--you lose that asymmetrical advantage. That can be fun of course. 

- Your starting position and the state of nearby mobs will give you a rough idea of where your quarry is. Follow the trail of dead crabs. 

- Be weird. I found that sitting in the 'defeated slump' pose in an obvious location and allowing the player to come to me made them curious and overconfident (one player approached me with quarter health!) I think people assume you are looking in the same direction as your character. Hit the dodge button to leap instantly into action and put them on the back foot. Look out for telltale signs that you're about to get firebombed or shivved though. 

- The invader Yellowfinger is not a human player...it took me longer than I'd care to admit to realise this. He will attack you without a second thought, even though you are both working towards the same goal!

- There is nothing sweeter than seeing that empty Estus animation.

&amp;nbsp;

(Found on a floppy disk left by a previous tenant. Broken markup language stripped for readability. The handful of images originally associated with the article can not be located.) 

&amp;nbsp;

The chthonically-oriented among you may be interested in the 'Roguelike Cave' beneath the tumbledown Chapel of ____ __________ in Yucatan, Mexico. Roguelike is a word borrowed from the world of computer gaming, where it refers to a niche genre featuring procedurally-generated levels and the threat of permanent death.

&amp;nbsp;

The Gazetteer recently undertook an expedition to this notorious metacave for the benefit of its readers. The team from __________________ arrived in May of this year, and after purchasing access from the local police (speak to Captain ________, who will be only too happy to help) they were able to make camp on the grounds of the Chapel and perform their research unmolested. 

&amp;nbsp;

The location of the cave mouth seems to be the only fixed feature of the Roguelike Cave. The cave mouth can be accessed from a small chamber beneath the east wing of the Chapel. Today the ceiling of this chamber is broken and crumbling, and has been open to the elements since locals torched the Chapel in 1960. Use your own ladder or suitable climbing gear here; the rusted iron rungs set into the wall should not be trusted. Quaint warnings in Spanish and English on the walls of the chamber strongly discourage further exploration. There is evidence that the cave mouth was once sealed with a plug of concrete, but this mass has been rejected and now lines the floor of the chamber as pale gravel. 

&amp;nbsp;

The cave mouth has the appearance of a crude mineshaft or similar manmade tunnel. Persons over six feet in height may have to stoop for a while as the tunnel winds down into the rock, but rest assured it will soon open out to reveal a chamber with a vaulted ceiling and walls streaked with bright strata of shocked quartz. This is referred to as the 'true entrance' or 'root chamber'. You will notice that certain strata in the cave walls emit a faint phosphorescence--you can carry your own light source, but we suggest you simply allow your eyes to adjust to this omnipresent glow. 

&amp;nbsp;

A seeker will need to proceed alone, as the root chamber will invariably be a dead end for a party of two or more. The metacave seems to reject the presence of any recording device, camera, or radio in the same manner. This puts it in the realm of Single Observer Phenomenon, where something as small as a spider on one's clothing can bar entry. Follow the usual SOP protocols here. 

&amp;nbsp;

The lone seeker will discover one or more passages leading from the root chamber, and these may be explored at his or her leisure, with the assurance that the layout of visited parts of the cave will not shift during any one visit! That said, attempts to mark a trail from one chamber to another will fail, as environmental changes will reset once unobserved. Bring your own notepad and pen! 

&amp;nbsp;

Multiple spelunkers may proceed into the cave system simultaneously as long as they enter the root chamber alone. They will not encounter each other during their explorations. (The disaster in 19__, believed to be caused by one man's attempted assembly of a camera whilst already beyond the root, led to the loss of two other souls that were exploring the caves in parallel. Phenomena collapse is no laughing matter!) 

&amp;nbsp;

For the most part the metacave presents itself as a conventional limestone cave; that is, multiple branching chambers connected by narrow passages apparently carved by water. However, the following unique features were encountered during the team's visit: 

&amp;nbsp;

- a chamber containing a marble baptismal font, apparently from the Chapel above. The font was warm to the touch. The rim was chipped and spotted here and there with old blood. The floor of the chamber was scattered with what the researcher believed to be broken  eggshells. (Closer inspection revealed that these were tiny infant skulls, all bearing signs of having been dashed against a hard edge)

&amp;nbsp; 

- a chamber containing an abandoned breastplate and boots of apparent European origin. The items appeared almost new

&amp;nbsp;

- a narrow, spiralling, increasingly smooth and slippery tunnel ending the dark mouth of an oubliette, into which the researcher dared not proceed

&amp;nbsp;

- a carved relief depicting an accurate map of the major craters on the far side of the Moon

&amp;nbsp;

- a chamber containing a dirty bedroll, water bottle, and the still-warm embers of a fire 

&amp;nbsp;

- a chamber knee-deep with red mud. Upon entering the mud the researcher was swarmed by some variety of leech and barely made it back to the surface alive, having lost a great deal of blood and 30% of her skin below the knee

&amp;nbsp;

- a chamber containing a hunched simian skeleton. The skull had multiple gold teeth and one arm wore a still-functioning digital wristwatch 

&amp;nbsp; 

- a chamber where the seeker reported being (almost!) overwhelmed by the urge to bury himself in the loose cool gravel

&amp;nbsp;

- a sturdy oak door in an otherwise unremarkable tunnel 

&amp;nbsp;

- a tunnel where the seeker heard the sound of a nearby group speaking excitedly in an unfamiliar language. Their footsteps seemed to pass along the tunnel and on into the dark beyond. 

&amp;nbsp;

- a chamber containing the desiccated lower half of a corpse dressed in modern spelunking gear. The upper half of the body was apparently embedded in the rock. This chamber was encountered by two members of the team, first on day 4, then on day 16--the first hint that the metacave contains a limited (though apparently vast) set of chambers simply arranged in unique ways. This chamber has been dubbed 'Red Nikes' based on the corpse's footwear 

&amp;nbsp;

- a very long run of steep, winding steps ending in an apparent dead end

&amp;nbsp;

The list of static features goes on quite a bit! The intention here is to hint of the variety of features a seeker might encounter in the metacave, not to provide an exhaustive list. 

&amp;nbsp;

Of greater interest (and greater danger) are the three apparently intelligent entities that were encountered during the team's twenty days in on site. The team logged some three hundred unique features in total, resulting in a ratio of about 100:1--that is, for every hundred or so static chambers the team logged, they encountered one intelligent entity. If the team's belief that there are some tens of thousands of unique chambers yet to be found holds true, then the intelligent population of the Roguelike Cave is likely measured in the hundreds. The entities encountered were as follows:

&amp;nbsp;

- On day 8, Dr. ____ encountered a 'sluggish old man' making his way from one cave chamber to another sprinkling the spores of an unidentified blood-red fungus. The spores sprouted into clusters of button-sized red caps almost immediately. The man's robes were thick with the fungus, trailing heavily behind him. Upon seeing Dr. ____, the mushroom-spreader started toward him, mouth open in a groan, spore-stained arms outstretched. The old man moved slowly, and was trivial to evade, but his footsteps could be heard following the doctor all the way back to the entrance chamber.

&amp;nbsp;

- On day 11, _____________ encountered an attractive dark-haired girl apparently in her late teens or early twenties, wearing clothes that would have been modern in 1975. The girl reported that she'd only just lost her way after exploring the first few chambers of the cave. When _____________ asked the girl if she knew the current year, or even where exactly the cave was located, she became agitated and demanded that the young man 'follow her back out' and 'keep her safe'. He followed the girl for over an hour, but had the good sense to make note of his route as he went. Twice the girl asked him to 'stop being such a square' and put the notepad away. When they arrived at a large, steaming, faintly sulphur-smelling pool, the girl insisted that they 'get clean together', then proceeded to remove her attire and slip into the waters. Tempting as this offer was, the young seeker fled immediately. 

&amp;nbsp;

- On the final day of the investigation, team leader ___________ encountered what he described as 'a bazaar' during his deepest exploration yet, apparently tended by a young man of eastern origin. The bazaar sold dried goods, perfumed water, and mountains of trinkets (a pair of round-rimmed spectacles, a Bic pen, a box of cigars, a pair of jeans, etc etc). The storekeeper offered his goods in exchange for 'days of service'. He would not explain the nature of the service that his customers would need to render. As ____________ bid the man goodbye and made to leave the chamber, the shopkeeper followed, attempting to shove a random selection of wares into the researcher's hands and offering him large discounts ('even a few minutes of service sir, even a few minutes, you can have all, you can have all'). The protestation ceased as soon as he left the chamber, and the man calmly returned to tending his stalls.

&amp;nbsp;

With that, our readers should already have a fair sense of the place. The team have made the full log of their findings available upon request to ______ at ____________ of ____. There's still much more to discover, so get yourself to Mexico, get exploring, and let us know what you find! You could end up published in the Gazetteer!

&amp;nbsp;

(Found while digging through floppies left by a previous tenant of _____________ ______. File was formatted in broken HTML. This has been stripped for readability.)

&amp;nbsp;

Persons who wish to explore new and secret vistas should consider the rite of the Far Shore. The only prerequisites for the rite are a still night, a sufficiently remote section of coastline, and the ability to swim at a sustained pace for around 700-1500 meters (depending on coastal geography)!

&amp;nbsp;

A moderately strong swimmer can train to swim for 1000 meters (20 lengths of an Olympic swimming pool) in a matter of weeks. Additional time should be set aside to train in the brisk temperatures, chop and surface currents associated with the open ocean. (Note: regular ocean swimming comes with a host of health benefits that are worth the effort alone!)

&amp;nbsp;

Successful visits to the Far Shore have been achieved between 2 and 3am on nights within 48 hours of a new moon. Cloud cover was invariably total. An attempt during an early waxing moon and 6/8ths cloud cover ended in the swimmer returning with her irises sintered shut by some unknown phenomenon.

&amp;nbsp;

Lore demands that the shore of departure must be lightless as far as the eye can see. This requirement has become markedly more difficult in the 20th century, where accessible beachfront real estate is in high demand. Thus the modern seeker must seek out relatively inaccessible shores. This will render rescue difficult or impossible should the swimmer encounter difficulties. 

&amp;nbsp;

The chosen stretch of ocean should be free of buoys, boats, small islands, or other sources of orientation. The swimmer must depart alone. Shoes, clothes and underwear should be folded and left somewhere above the high water line.

&amp;nbsp;

The swimmer should depart perpendicular to the shore and proceed until they are quite confident that all coastal geography has sunken beyond their rear horizon and out of sight. It is important that the swimmer makes this decision on instinct alone--a premature glance back to shore will invalidate the rite with indeterminate results. If in any doubt, swim further. 

&amp;nbsp;

At the equidistant point between the conventional shore and the Far Shore, the successful seeker may encounter a region of total stillness in the waters, where the mirrored waves of both worlds destructively interfere within their personal frame of reference. The swimmer may notice a sharp increase or decrease in ambient temperature. It is possible here to take a breath of two and look around; the sea, sky and the flat horizon between them should be a continuous inky black. That said, lore suggests that every second spent in the boundary region brings with it the risk of disorientation. The seeker must swim on while he or she still retains a rough heading. 

&amp;nbsp;

Note: Seekers have witnessed the shades of other swimmers swimming alongside them (or even through them) as they pass through the boundary region. These phantoms should be ignored. They may appear to swim at all orientations (even up from below and apparently into the air, or vice versa). Do not attempt to follow the shade of another seeker. Trust in your own heading!

&amp;nbsp;

Continue until the faint blue and green lights of the Far Shore appear on the horizon. The geography will be broadly similar to the shore of departure--flat beaches yield flat beaches, fjords yield fjords, and so on. Often the shape of distant mountains will be familiar but mirrored, or smoothed, or tilted as if by some great and ancient upheaval of the earth. Some describe the Far Shore as dream-geography made solid; others liken it to a glimpse of an alternate Earth, where the primordial composition of elements was tinily different. 

&amp;nbsp;

Swim all the way to shore for a well-deserved rest; you will find a set of clothes above the high-water mark. More often than not, the clothes are close equivalents of the clothes you left behind, but seekers have found: 

&amp;nbsp;

- a modern shirt paired with ancient-looking fur breeches and moccasins;

- a flight suit resembling that of a Mercury astronaut, but with an unfamiliar insignia and lettering in an unfamiliar alphabet;

- the tattered remains of a cocktail dress;

- a denim jumpsuit, stiff with coagulated blood;

- a WWII-era Naval uniform, badly singed

&amp;nbsp;

Now suitably attired, the intrepid explorer is quite free to explore! 

&amp;nbsp;

The lights of the Far Shore appear to be illusory; attempts to track their soft glow to a fixed source are always fruitless. All known visits to the Far Shore have found it uninhabited and devoid of animal life, but one seeker reported evidence that something wide and heavy (a large sea-lion perhaps) had recently dragged itself on to the beach, moved along the dune line in a zig-zag fashion for some fifty meters, then retreated sharply to the water.

&amp;nbsp;

Time appears to simply sweep back and forth between a high and low tide; beyond that, time may as well not exist. Changes made to the environment (markings in the sand, scrape-marks made on rock or bark) simply revert once out of view. An attempt to start a fire with a wood-drill made from bone-dry driftwood was abandoned after an hour of furious, fruitless work. The blackness of the sky will not abate, even after a stay twelve hours or more.

&amp;nbsp;

A seeker can explore the Far Shore for just as long as they can stand the obscure, alien rules of the place, or until their thirst or hunger can no longer be ignored. Though there is often some hearty-looking plant life, no sources of food or potable water have ever been reported, so long-term habitation is not an option. 

&amp;nbsp;

Additionally, even if food could be found there and shelter built, sleep is impossible. Lore mentions one man who dared to rest before his homeward swim; his mind was greeted by a 'wall of psychic fire' on the cusp of sleep and he found himself all the more exhausted for it.

&amp;nbsp;

Departing for home is as simple as it sounds; the rite is simply reversed. Visitors to the Far Shore have reported sounds of howling as they depart, or a deep, distant grinding, or a frantic splashing somewhere just behind them, but no (surviving!) seeker has ever dared turn around to witness the commotion, so no further data is available.

She's right, but it's actually true. It's had me weirded out for a while now. 

&amp;nbsp;

I spent some time with my maternal grandfather in the weeks before his death from pancreatic cancer. We were never all that close, but due to my proximity at the time (I had a temp teaching job in the city where he lived) I was the only one of his grandchildren to visit him in those last days. He revealed some stories from his younger days that left me unsettled. 

&amp;nbsp;

It went like this: as a child he was plagued by episodes of sleep paralysis. In his late teens he taught himself to relax and control the state, to the point that he discovered that he could roam free of his sleeping body for short periods of time. 

&amp;nbsp;

He covertly read everything available on the subject of 'astral projection' but his experiences were grounded in comparison to what he called 'fairy tales'. His movement in this dim parallel realm was sluggish, he could not fly, and he could just about shove his way through solid surfaces at the cost of valuable time and focus. About half the time he would be blind, only able to feel his way around his bedroom and the house beyond. Other times he would be lifted and blown hundreds of yards by a silent, airless wind. Sometimes, he said, it felt like he was up to his ankles in cold tar, and when that happened he could only walk a few yards before waking.

&amp;nbsp;

(He visibly shook with nervous excitement when he recounted this stuff. His voice wavered. He'd kept it to himself for sixty years. Nobody wanted to hear about this in the early 50's, and he'd been just as reluctant to talk about it. The threat of the madhouse cowed him into silence.)

&amp;nbsp;

Young Bob _____ was a year late for WWII, but he was right on time for Korea. His time in the Army was relatively humdrum and unspectacular. By day, he drove jeeps from one depot to another for a transportation company. By night he continued his exploration of the other world from his bunk. It was during this time that he encountered the first entity that he called a 'Sleeper'. 

&amp;nbsp;

This Sleeper appeared as a nondescript, faintly-luminous figure of average height and build for a male. He saw this figure at the foot of his bed immediately after exiting his body. The entity was oriented towards the dark corner of the tent with his hands cupped in front of his face. My grandfather approached the Sleeper and reached out an arm in an attempt to interact. The Sleeper slid towards the corner as if he was mounted on a dolly. 

&amp;nbsp;

He followed--though he felt especially sluggish, like he was fighting sleep himself. He drew close enough to look at the Sleeper's face, which shifted between fixed expressions of terror, sorrow, and manic joy. The palms of the Sleeper's hands flickered with tiny sparks of color, and his empty gaze was fixed on the light.   

&amp;nbsp;

He asked aloud if the Sleeper was dreaming, and tried to gain his attention by waving. The apparition was unresponsive. The Sleeper then slid through the canvas into the muddy walkway beyond, and my grandfather fought to follow him. In the last seconds before waking, he felt a whole-body chill and saw an articulated snakelike shadow ('something between a snake and a charred spinal column') gather around the Sleeper. The shadow unfurled a long mothlike proboscis from its center of mass towards the Sleeper's navel or crotch. My grandfather woke to find his bunkmate whimpering in his sleep. He woke his bunkmate, who seemed fine and remembered nothing.

&amp;nbsp;

Over the weeks my grandfather told me other stories about his short forays into the unknown. It preoccupied him more and more as the disease worked on him, as you might imagine. He told me one other story about encountering a Sleeper. 

&amp;nbsp;

This time it was in the early eighties. His ability had atrophied after returning from the war and meeting my grandmother, but by the 80's their kids had moved out, their marriage had broken down, he was living alone, and his secret talent had spontaneously re-emerged. 

&amp;nbsp;

The Sleeper was in the hall beyond his apartment door. It was another man, tall and thin, again preoccupied with the palms of his hands. He watched as the Sleeper slid back and forth along the length of the hall 'like a statue on rollerskates'. He called out, and this time the Sleeper seemed to detect my grandfather's presence and look away from its palms, if only for a few seconds. The random sliding ceased and he looked confused. 

&amp;nbsp;

Then my grandfather heard an atonal whine like a distant siren or an unfamiliar animal howl. A long bifurcated head like a set of dark, bony tongs emerged from a wall and the space became heavy and sluggish. My grandfather felt himself begin to wake. He watched the scene long enough to see the tongs clamp around the man's back and belly and lift him away. 

&amp;nbsp;

He woke feeling shaky and nauseous; he had a hard time getting back to sleep. 

&amp;nbsp;

It could be a total coincidence, but he was woken a few hours later by a commotion in the hall outside his apartment; he heard a man identifying himself as a police officer ask his neighbor if he'd seen anything strange that night. The voice pressed him again and again--'have you seen anything strange? Any strange lights? Don't be afraid now, anything you tell me is in total confidence...' 

&amp;nbsp;

After ten minutes or so the man excused himself and left. Tyres screeched in the parking lot, like whoever it was was driving away angry. 

&amp;nbsp;

After hearing that story I made my grandfather his dinner--more of a ceremonial task as he'd stopped eating--and I left soon after. He was hospitalised the next day and died a week later. His last words to me that evening were 'what do you think those things are?' and I honestly couldn't say. His voice was frail and I didn't have anything comforting for him. Figments of a broken dream-mechanism, maybe. Bad neurons from a long-forgotten bang on the head as a child. Or who knows?

* Still early in a new career. Received a contract for the 'Duna 3', which was a flyby of Duna, Minmus and the Mun. 

* Took the opportunity to send a mission to Ike. Bob and Bill in a lander can, collecting science, planting flags, all the good stuff. Unfortunately the Ike lander had only about 450m/s dV left over after returning to orbit around Duna, and the cheapest return journey was about 650m/s and three years away. Damn. 

* A stroke of luck, however: two contracts came up, one to 'Explore Ike', and another to collect a ship part in orbit of Ike. 

* I built a combined resupply and capture mission. Sent it up, resupplied Bill and Bob with fuel and noms, then took them back to another part of Ike. All good. Fresh science was had. After taking them back into Ike orbit, they only had about 500m/s dV remaining. Damn again! 

* Rendezvoused with the resupply ship again, topped up the tanks. Now the resupply/capture ship would not have enough fuel to get home, but at least Bill and Bob would get there. The Ike lander now had just enough dV to get home, so I set up the maneuver node and set an alarm.

* Back to the resupply/capture ship, I captured the part in Ike orbit. SUDDEN STROKE OF LUCK: the part was a small Rockomax tank, full of fuel. Plenty to get home. Also met with the Ike lander _again_ and topped them up all the way for good measure. 

* Took the capture ship home to Kerbin without incident. 

* Switched back to the Ike lander and they were out of noms, refusing to work. Optimal transfer window missed.

* Okay, fine. Sent up another resupply mission with all the noms they'd need for the trip home. Met with the Ike lander and refilled their supplies. Found a new window for the return journey. 

* We're off! The Ike lander made its burn for home. 

* Arrived back in Kerbin SOI, coming in hot. I'd chosen to burn more fuel for a non-optimal (but faster and earlier) transfer, so their flyby of Kerbin was about as hyperbolic as it gets. The burn in Duna orbit had been good, however, and took them about 170km from Kerbin. The guys just had to make a minor adjustment to set them up for a pants-browningly deep and heroic aerobrake and they would be fine. 

* Unfortunately, Bill and Bob finished their noms somewhere around Minmus orbit and refused to work. 

* GUYS YOU NEED TO SWITCH ON THE ENGINES NOW

* I'LL BUY YOU BOTH STEAKS IN THE KSC CANTEEN

* Nope, okay, fine. Time for a Very Rapid Capture mission, with noms. Sent up a ship that was essentially a claw, a fuel tank clustered with supplies, and a mainsail, with about 6000 m/s of dV. Launched, then sent it into a hyperbolic orbit that matched the direction of the Ike lander (now past Kerbin and heading back towards oblivion) with about 1.5x the velocity. 

* Rendezvoused with Bill and Bob somewhere beyond Munar orbit. I imagine the burn to match velocities was visible from the ground. Captured them neatly with the claw.

* Burned retrograde with the remains of the fuel in the Very Rapid Capture ship. This got rid of half of their velocity and bought them a day or so of time, but their orbit still took them out of Kerbin's SOI.

* Triple overtime for the ground crews, who constructed and sent up a Very Very Rapid Capture ship in record time. This caught the Ike Lander somewhere beyond Minmus orbit. Burned for home. Used the last of the RCS fuel...and _just_ got a crazy long Kerbin orbit with about 50m/s of RCS fuel to spare. 

* Used the remaining drops of RCS fuel to raise the periapsis avoid a horrible collision with Kerbin. Periapsis: 82km. Apoapsis: about three meters short of the edge of the SOI, I imagine Bill and Bob need to press themselves against the Kerbinward wall of the lander during each apoapsis pass.

* Now it's time for the final, more relaxed rescue mission...

* Good god that was an expensive mission to Ike. But I guess we can get those Mun and Minmus flybys in before we go home. (Knowing my luck the guys will either crash into the Mun before I can reach them again, or get accelerated back out into interplanetary space by an unplanned slingshot maneuver.)

&amp;nbsp;

I recently moved to a new town for work, so I am renting a mid-terrace house in a cheap area until I get the lay of the land. Red brick, damp, net curtains, parked taxis and white vans and skips choking the street into a single lane: you get the idea. I've spoken to my neighbours on either side maybe twice in six months, and that was to give them deliveries that had been left off with me while they were out.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm not sure if this is an international concept, but here, your online shopping can get dropped off with a neighbour if you're not around. You get a little ticket through the door telling you where to go knocking to get your stuff. 

&amp;nbsp;

Well, a few months ago I ordered a console that was left off with the old dear across the street. No problem! Except the delivery guy put two tickets through my door--one with the address across the street, the other _entirely blank_. My mischief-making instincts told me to keep the blank one. I put it with my old bills and takeout menus.

&amp;nbsp;

My neighbour to the right is a very large bald gay man. He  has a big gay party every other week. He's converted his back yard into a party/workout zone with outside speakers and a hot tub. When the party spills into the yard (which it inevitably does) things get loud and messy. I had to throw a few items of miscellaneous clothing back over the wall after his last shindig. When he works out (deadlifts all day), he does a lot of grunting and shouting, which forces me to imagine getting angrily fucked by him, a kind of imposition into my imagination-space that I resent. Other than that, he seems like a nice guy. Always polite, always ready to flash a big toothy smile.

&amp;nbsp;

My neighbour to the left is a wiry and po-faced Muslim taxi driver who lives alone. Now and then his adult kids pop round for a visit (he has a reasonably hot daughter, too) but I've never seen a wife. He slams the door of his car about seventeen times a day; it makes my living-room window shudder and agitates my cat. When he walks to and from his car he pounds his feet as if to assert his dominance over the pavement. The couple of times I've met him face to face he seemed to be grinding his teeth. A pressure-cooker of a man, in other words.

&amp;nbsp;

So, now to the fuckup: last night I had a few drinks after work and came home mildly buzzed. My need to fuck with someone was overwhelming. I spotted the blank delivery ticket in my kitchen crap-pile and found a pen. I had a righteous giggle to myself as I filled out the ticket.

&amp;nbsp;

I filled out the taxi driver's name and address. I filled in the box that says ""we left it with a neighbour!"" and filled in my big gay neighbour's address. There was a little box where I could write a description of the package so I just wrote 

&amp;nbsp;

'girthy sex aid'

&amp;nbsp;

and left it at that. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm not sure how I thought this would turn out. It was an experiment. Would he ignore it? Write it off as weird? Realise he had ordered _no such girthy sex aid?_ Would he attempt to claim it? How bewildering would that be for my other neighbour?

&amp;nbsp;

My neighbour was out on a night shift, and I knew he wouldn't be home until 5am or so (slamming and stomping) so I slid out like Peter Pan's shadow, slipped the ticket through his door, and danced back into my house all in a single breath. Satisfied, I watched TV for a while then went to bed. 

&amp;nbsp;

I was woken at about 7:30 this morning by stomping and shouting below my bedroom window. The taxi driver was pacing like a caged animal in front of my big gay neighbour's door, like he was trying to wear a figure-8 pattern into the pavement. ""WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS? WHAT THE FUCK DOES THIS MEAN? IT SAYS I HAVE TO COLLECT FROM YOU, BUT WHAT?""

&amp;nbsp;

He'd flipped his tagiya-clad lid. I opened my window and leaned out, watching. 

&amp;nbsp;

""YOU FUCKING FILTHY QUEER WITH YOUR QUEER PARTIES. EXPLAIN THIS TO ME.""

&amp;nbsp;

He kept saying 'queer' like this. He seemed confused as to who was holding a package for whom. Certainly he seemed infuriated by the mere association with a 'girthy sex aid'. 

&amp;nbsp;

My big gay neighbour, to his infinite credit, simply closed his door. I began to feel a pang of regret. I'd done my part to damage Muslim/gay relations on the street. I'd connected these guys like a conducting rod in a storm, channeling hatred from one to the other. My neighbour across the street looked at me from his bedroom window and shot me a low-key crazy-swirly gesture; I nodded. 

&amp;nbsp;

My neighbour looked up at me from the street and snorted, shaking his head. He waved the ticket at my gay neighbour's door as if to summon an explanation. ""Do you believe it?"" he said. ""Do you believe it?""

&amp;nbsp;

I gave him my best supportive shrug.

&amp;nbsp;

Well: it's later now and my big gay neighbour has just finished shouting up a storm in his back yard. He sounds fine. I want to put my head over the wall and ask him 'what was all that about this morning?' but I'm afraid that somehow he'll know it was me.

This was followed by low shouts and gunshots from a nearby building--the Supermutants were now in the mix, running headlong towards the Synth. The Synth couldn't do much to retaliate because he was busy with a Mole Rat Brood Mother that had breached the ground by his feet.

The wacom forums have a few dead posts to this effect, nobody seems to know the answer. (I guess the answer is, if you're dropping that amount of money on a Cintiq, just buy another video card). 

Still. Buying a new video card (with the same spec as my current one but with a DisplayPort output) is going to be painful.

Currently doing naked/minimal weapons/no buddy/no traces runs on as many missions as possible. This naturally made me long for the old days.

I haven't played MGS3 since it was first released. That's nearly ten years now! So I picked up the HD bundle. And after a few hours of play on European Extreme (oh boy those controls are horrific at first, most of my alerts come from standing up when I mean to lie down, or botched hold-ups), I can say that MGS3 is the peak of the series for me. It really is. 

Every area feels lovingly crafted, full of secrets to find. Every encounter requires an individual strategy--you don't feel like a vastly overpowered God of Slumber or Remote Murder. Every enemy has something new to say when interrogated, something useful to drop if you hold them up. European Extreme (instant game over on alert mode) means every area needs careful planning. 

_This_ is what I want in an MGS. I'm excited to go home and play it again. My greatest wish for future MGS games (if they are ever made) is that they have all the humor and detail of MGS3 with the huge interconnected &amp; hand-crafted areas of a Dark Souls game. Mastering those games brings me a kind of delight that's hard to describe.

Don't get me wrong: MGSV was/is excellent, and a worthy experience in itself. Huge and ambitious and endless fun. But damn, I'd kill for a pared-back Metal Gear game with modern controls and movement fluidity but with discrete zones and enemy encounters that feel like MGS3 again.

I played the first 70% or so as a stealth roofielord. As soon as I unlocked gun customization I made a silenced tranq sniper, and that was my go-to gun for every single mission. My loadout was the wu pistol, the stun arm, the silenced tranq sniper, and just in case things got 'messy', the rubber bullet assault rifle. Backing that up were sleep grenades, sleep mines, stun grenades...you get the idea. It was a fun way to play.

However...

Something happened--a glitch maybe, or maybe I hadn't been keeping track of the consumption carefully enough, but I loaded the game yesterday and found I had zero golden crescent flowers. I couldn't deploy with my non-lethal loadout. It was time to put together a lethal setup. I'd almost maxed out research on shotguns and sniper rifles, so I went into the field with the smallest sawn-off shotgun and a silenced sniper rifle, with the shotshell handgun as a secondary weapon. I still had the stun arm available, obviously, and sleep grenades if I really needed them.

_I had so much more fun._ If I really wanted to capture someone, I'd just shoot them in the ass and extract them quickly (it helps to have the [wormhole fulton](/spoiler)). I played as non-lethally as possible, but if a d-rank guard or sniper was in my way, I wouldn't hesitate to pop his skull. It was a release after all that careful tranq sniping. 

Now I'm mopping up side-ops, going in loud with the Serval (it can one-shot trucks!) and a silenced auto-shotgun. The stun arm and non-lethal support weapons give me plenty of options when I want to bring people home.

Drawbacks: it's very easy to set off yourself if you're not careful, and I've seen it catch one guy in a patrol and then merely stagger the second guy at the very edge of the cloud (with the --- icon instead of the sleep icon).

On Friday night I accessed Quiet for the first time, and over the course of Saturday I used her enough to bring her bond level up to 100, get her gold outfit, and get her awesome silenced tranquilizer rifle. We were a perfect team, but it was all _too perfect_. It got to the point where outposts would be 90% asleep before I arrived, and my job was basically to spot for her and fulton out soldiers. Spot for Quiet, fulton out soldiers. Spot for Quiet, fulton out soldiers. Get Quiet to move to a new position. Fulton out soldiers. Again, again, again. Easy S-ranks all the way, and between battles she would put on a sexy show in the helicopter. Great.
