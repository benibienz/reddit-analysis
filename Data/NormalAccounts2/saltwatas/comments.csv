3,"CofC is pretty socially diverse in terms of what kind of people you'll fit in with. Frat kids, surfers, guidos, homos, you name it. I'm a senior, and love it. You don't ever really feel confined to a campus in the city which I like, having transferred from SC. It is an expensive city however. If you go to your classes, and find a chill part time job for some extra spending cash, you're sure to have a killer time here.",2016-03-17 17:36:16+00:00,d13he1g,1,t3_4aqyuw,56479,Charleston

5,"I wouldn't recommend paying for lessons in South Carolina, just because 1, we don't have that consistent of swell, and 2, save that money. The best way to learn is just time on the water. No one will be able to teach you how to shred in a matter of lessons. People are usually pretty chill out there, and are always happy to give pointers.

Surf the right side of the pier at Folly, that's where most of my buddies and I go, It's a much more relaxed crowd in my opinion. There tends to be a lot of wave rage at the washout on a good day.",2016-01-14 20:24:56+00:00,cyybp9f,1,t3_40yuev,7268,Charleston
6,"Check out Wagner Terrace and places near Hampton Park. There are some very nice streets north of the crosstown on the west side. The east isn't too rough as it is industrial, but overall not a great spot. Mount Pleasant is great, but expensive. I'm not a big fan of West Ashley. Johns Island has some great spots as well. I personally live downtown but it isn't worth the price honestly, I'm moving to Wagner Terrace this summer. Hope this helps.",2016-01-07 00:51:40+00:00,cyoret2,1,t3_3zr4ij,22592,Charleston

17,"Good question, I would assume that they're either hired by the TV Network, the NFL, or one of the team franchises, all of which should have their employees on an insurance plan. If not, the NFL tries to avoid lawsuits at any costs. 

So to answer your question, I would assume he'll get a settlement that covers all three. 

These things happen more than you'd expect. There was also another one Sunday in the Bengals game that damaged a 250k camera and banged up the operators face pretty good. Again, I don't have an exact answer but there has to be some sort of protocol given the regularity of the situation.",2015-11-09 19:33:46+00:00,cwuexib,2,t1_cwud70v,2424,sports

19,"I'm downtown near the crosstown and work off exit 209 near GC. If you're remotely concerned about having a good nightlife, then Mount Pleasant and Downtown are your only real options. Both are expensive compared to West Ashley and GC, but there are some really nice spots near Hampton Park and Wagner Terrace that are affordable,quiet, and only a quick bike ride to the bars downtown. 

As far as commuting goes, I get to work at about 6:45, and have no issues with traffic unless I'm running late. 26 gets pretty bad both ways around 7-7:15. It's usually about a 15 minute commute for me doing about 70.

Idk exactly what you're looking for but if you're single and under 35 then Mount Pleasant and Downtown are the only ways to go.

Hope this helps, welcome to Chuck.",2015-11-09 14:52:56+00:00,cwu3gpm,4,t1_cwsi9ab,127448,Charleston

24,"I was out deep jigging for cobia (shaking a heavy lure towards the bottom) about 20 miles off the coast of Beaufort, SC at a well known wreck called the Betsy Ross. My dad and I were in a 27 foot center console. We had been catching several small cobia in the 20-30 pound range. When we brought one up, several others from the school would follow it out of confusion. We were in about 65 Feet of water, with about 40 feet of visibility. Once one was hooked, you would soon get a glimpse of it. So I had one on the line, it felt small so I brought it in pretty quickly without much fight. We had it in the water on the side of the boat when we heard what sounded like a small wave breaking in front of us. We were leaned over looking down at the fish at the time. When we heard the noise, we both looked up simultaneously and saw a small submarine headed directly towards the boat. In shock, we dropped the fish and jumped backwards before we really knew what was going on. What I thought was a submarine was a tiger shark. It bum rushed the boat, snagged our fish, then took off. I couldn't really tell you exactly how large the shark was, but it was big enough that I figured a small crew could be inside operating it. If you've ever seen a large shark at sea you know what I'm saying when I tell you that there is nothing like the primal fear you get when you see something like that. It's a very surreal feeling to see a predator with a mouth nearly big enough for you to fit in.",2015-11-05 00:09:47+00:00,cwosyst,1,t3_3rhdoo,44329,AskReddit

Don't buy some plastic bullshit or big ass trendy contemporary watch or something flashy. Get something that you can give to your children one day. Work hard, then when you've hit a benchmark that drastically improves your standard of living down the road, get another. I find this highly motivating for myself.
