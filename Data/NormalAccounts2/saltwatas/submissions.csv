I specifically marked them in case they were stolen, and low and behold, they vanish and show up the next day at my local keg retailer. 

They won't give the shells back to be because they paid the thief for the shells. Aren't they obligated to give them back to me for receiving stolen property?

They admitted they had nothing in their records for the shells but they take shells regardless.

They said they would give me the security camera footage and let me handle it myself with the thief but I would just like to get me shells back so I can return them to my buddy.

Any advice would be awesome, Thanks.",beer,"Question: If a retailer receives a stolen shell, is the retailer obligated to return the shell to it's rightful owner?",https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/4ej1y1/question_if_a_retailer_receives_a_stolen_shell_is/
