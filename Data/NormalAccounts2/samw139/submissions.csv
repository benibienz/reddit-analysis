I often get kicked no matter how good i play or how nice i am to other players, it has gotten so bad that i get kicked around every 4th match. These are the most common reasons i get kicked.

Scenario 1: The enemy t team did not exit spawn at Inferno so my team decides to rush them while i tell them to stay and since they all die the enemy team immediatly comes for me and since i am only 1 person i also die.
Result: Kick

Scenario 2: I and my entire team is at a bomb point and as t i plant bomb and then my entire team decides to go hunting outside of bomb area while i tell them not to and they all end up dead and shortly thereafter i get overrun since again i'm the only one.
Result: Kick

Scenario 3: My team is losing and i'm not bottom fragger, infact i'm at most times top fragger when my team is losing but the first to get a votekicked called on them no matter how good they do is often kicked.
Result: Kick

Scenario 4: Why didn't you drop me awp?! (when i had already dropped him awp before)
Result: Kick

I Really try to be nice, i never return flame and when someone calls a votekick on me i generally accept my fate. I almost always deny a votekick when someone else is being kicked unless they are griefing but those people never seem to repay the favor.

Could anyone provide any tips on these scenarios in MM? I always only use mic to give info and i am constantly in cooldown for votekicks.",GlobalOffensive,I'm constantly being kicked for being a teamplayer in MM and it is giving me cooldowns,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/4zu1uz/im_constantly_being_kicked_for_being_a_teamplayer/

I tried to play as arverni and decided to use a lone general to crush a single celtic slinger unit and to my suprise the slingers defeated the general's bodyguard and charges had almost no effect.

I then tried again by reloading a save but without repeatedly charging, about the same result: slingers lost 6 soldiers and i lost my general's bodyguard unit.

It seems like cavalry, even catapracths are weak and die like flies when charging basic archers and slingers. Literally heavy armoured riders armed with swords and spears clad in armor defeated by peasants with knives.
