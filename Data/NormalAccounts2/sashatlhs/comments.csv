0,"It's amazing how pervasive it is! And there are people that honestly believe that capitalism has brought more people out of poverty than any other system. I end up having to gently, but firmly, remind them that unions and worker's rights have actually brought more people out of poverty, otherwise we'd all be working for nearly nothing. Unfortunately we're sliding that way now again. ",2016-10-19 14:07:38+00:00,d8yq6me,2,t1_d8y5bba,45237,socialism

More often than not, I end up using elbows, but the musculature is too thin to let me really sink in and I end up going bone on bone, which isn't the most comfortable feeling in the world. Just imagine driving your elbow into a wood table. At that point, there's not much to do if a client doesn't feel like you're hitting their ""sweet spot"" because we can cause serious damage without knowing it.

11,"The reason why we have/had the eight hour work day, social security, and the numerous laws meant to limit the amount companies could exploit you are directly related to the Soviet Union. Let's not forget that during the Great Depression, the communist party was gaining huge ground here in the United States! Something had to be done for the workers, the largest economic force and amount of people at time before they staged their own communist revolution here. 

Unions being blamed for being socialist/communist goes back to companies not wanting to lose more of their profits to workers, I would bet they colluded to start some mudslinging campaign. ",2016-03-07 16:36:11+00:00,d0qvm3q,5,t1_d0qus69,1206,worldnews

I don't know if we read the same article, but I didn't get the feeling like she was ""bashing the evil west"", instead, showing how Yeltsin basically sold out the country. Why is it that when Western media portrays Russia, it's never ""propaganda bashing Russia"", but considered gospel? But when a Russian author writes an article that may not align with your preconceived notions of the West, it's considered propaganda?

27,"I love the sentiment, especially them acknowledging that they may not be a profitable guest, but that very rarely happens, if at all! I have regulars that sit at the bar for hours and whatever they leave doesn't cover whatever ""regular transactions"" would've covered in that time. People don't go to restaurants to tip you, they go to restaurants to eat, drink, socialize with their friends. That's why there is the standard 18-20% tip, because unless the service was exceptional and noteworthy, most people don't notice it and have it in their minds that the service they received merits 18-20%.",2015-09-10 20:19:46+00:00,cux4u3o,3,t1_cux4hb5,546,TalesFromYourServer
