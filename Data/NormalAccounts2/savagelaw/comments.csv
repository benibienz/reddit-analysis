8,"if you are worried then you should only increase the weight once you have a spotter to make sure you don't die or something.  I used to go up once I finished the full lift by 5 lbs and go from there.  If I failed the new weight three times, I went down 15 lbs and started over.  That usually got me past my failure point to move forward.  If you aren't confident in your ability to lift, then get a spotter the first and second time so you know if you can or can not lift the weight.  They can also watch you to make sure you aren't straining yourself too hard (look for the experienced ones) or lifting incorrectly as to not hurt yourself.",2016-10-14 08:45:24+00:00,d8rijqp,1.0,t3_57dl6o,30771.0,ketogains
9,"depends on what you're looking for.  Right now, amd is shit in single threaded applications (most games) as their individual cores aren't as strong as intel has right now.  Get an i5 (doesn't really matter the generation.  try to get the newest if you can though) and you'll probably only need about 8gb of ram.  Most of the time you wont go over that limit (I haven't seen this happen yet with one single game open).  You should also look into getting a 1060 or a rx 480 8gb version as those will likely have more life in them from the extra vram they have.  The 970 is a great card but it only has 3.5gb of usable ram while the 1060 has 6gb and even the cheaper rx 480 has a true 4gb.  Either of those other cards also perform in the same ballpark as the 970 (spitting distance from each other depending on the game).


If you are on a budget and want to get the most out of your money, then you should not get the 970 as the memory will haunt you later on down the road.  Once a game starts trying to use that last 500mb of vram your game will take a shit in the FPS department.  RIght now, it isn't that big of an issue, but later games will likely want to use the extra vram that the current cards are being built with.  The AMD cpu's are going to be getting a price cut soon to make room for the zen cpu's coming out next year so, if you can hold out, it might be a good idea to build with the sales coming up. 

[THIS is what](http://pcpartpicker.com/list/dLq9KZ) I'd build if I were you.  It'll save you about $100 on top of that as well.  You could even add another stick of corsair ram and still be less than what you have clipped up there.  the website I used it called pcpartpicker.com and is...wonderful.  It searches other websites for the lowest price and lets you build a system with the prices/rebates right there.  It's better then just looking on amazon or just newegg (those are both included in the search so if they are the cheapest, they will be the first vender when you order).",2016-10-14 03:54:27+00:00,d8rb8bb,1.0,t3_57dxpt,8603.0,gamingpc

32,"I wouldn't go flat black.  It has a ""it isn't finished yet"" look to me, personally.  The easiest way to change the look is to get different tires/wheels.  You can try to change the color of the wheels if you want.  Get that peel off paint so you can go to and from colors without fucking them up.  Not my choice in wheels, but not my truck either.  My truck still has stock paint, but it's peeling (I'm really rough with it), truck box, and 22's on it (craigslist special).  I don't have bed rails because it just doesn't have that look I want.  The truck box is more utility to me (no trunk) and the wheels were cheap.  I just wanted to see if I liked the look.  I'd lose the step bar unless it is used.  No sense in keeping it unless you really want that look.  There are hideaway ones too, but expensive.  There is such thing as ""too"" much chrome.  I'd lose the cab lights though.  Those only look ok on dually trucks or medium duty trucks (think uhaul or topkick trucks).  

I understand that your tastes are different than mine though, so these are all just suggestions with a small explanation of why I said them.  You might like all that and it all still boils down to what you want.  Your money, your truck, your time, and your pride.  What you could do is google it and find trucks that look like yours.

He said ""everyone has their habits...some worse than others.""

Maybe they did that shit so much, that they just can't break that habit.  That, being annoying as all hell, is their habit...that keeps me from getting really angry like I usually would have too.

43,"Sounds like it is about to die so, try and save what you need saved on something else.  A thumb drive or an external hard drive so you don't lose it.  It might not be recoverable soon.

Buying a hard drive is cheaper than buying another computer, unless you can get one for around $100.  Those aren't worth it unless you are using it as a media server or a media center.

you don't need to buy the GPU unless you plan on trying out some light PC gaming.  If that doesn't sound like something you'll be doing, than save the money and spend it on something else.

Installing the harddrive isn't all that difficult, but it depends on the case you have, and if you've done it before.  It isn't a sharp learning curve though, so don't get discouraged.  It is two cables (one power and one data) and mounting it inside the case.  Sometimes they go into a cage or they are on sleds.  It also could be mounted using screws.  All depends on the case.  It shouldn't take you more than 15 minutes, even for a first timer.

Go [Here](http://pcpartpicker.com/products/internal-hard-drive/) and pick what you need.  SSD for overall speed, but lower capacity.  HDD for larger total storage, but slower access speeds.  You wont know the difference if you stream from either, as the hard drives can read/write faster than most people's internet connection anyways.  If you are only using it for streaming, and have no real reason to use it for anything else. Than a smallish hard drive would be good.  120gb is the smallest I'd go, but you wont have much room for anything else being installed.  Hard drives are getting really cheap though, so it depends on what is for sale at the time you are ready to buy.

Here are some of the ones you can look into

http://pcpartpicker.com/product/dCxfrH/seagate-internal-hard-drive-st1000dm003 -this guy is 1tb (1000gb) of space.  Not the fastest, but cheap and ample space.

http://pcpartpicker.com/product/2RPfrH/hitachi-internal-hard-drive-0f10311 -twice as big as the first one.  same story.  cheap and ample space.

http://pcpartpicker.com/product/ZZJkcf/avexir-e100-120gb-25-solid-state-drive-avssde100zz-120gb -cheapest 120gb SSD.  Faster than both of the above, but also more expensive per GB of storage.

http://pcpartpicker.com/product/sz7CmG/silicon-power-internal-hard-drive-sp480gbss3s55s25 -twice as big as the one before.  Faster than the larger hard drives but more expensive per GB.

I put the 6x scope on my rifle (whatever I am using at the time whether it be bolt or semiauto) because it is only 2x more than the 4x and 2x less than the 8x so I get a good middle ground.  It also allows me to put the 14x on it for the long range snipers and I can still hit in close if I need too.  One way to get good at using it close is to put a 1x on it and play TDM/STDM so you can get into battle fast and get used to how it is looking down halls and such.  This type of play will let you play the objectives or counter snipe, depending on the situation you are in when you spawn.

If you want to camp and snipe, it all depends on the map and who is playing.  The larger, open maps are better for sniping than a smaller map like locker/metro as you can be far off without being noticed as easily.  In the smaller maps, you need to be quick to acquire the target and kill them as fast as you can so they can't get any shots off at you. Using a 4x scope would be more ideal in smaller maps as the suppression isn't as bad.  Get the bipod for the camp and snipe and get out there to practice.

112,"This is kind of a big question.  A few questions that would need to be answered would dictate what would suit you the best

1. How big is your budget?

2. What do you already have (CPU/RAM/Motherboard)?

3. What resolution do you game at (1080p/1440p/4k)?

4. How long do you normally keep your hardware?

5. Care about brand (Nvidia/AMD)?

6. Do you play games that allow mods (Fallout 4/skyrim)?



If you don't really have a budget, Nvidia can usually best amd in many aspects, but AMD isn't that much behind.  They are usually cheaper as well. Looking at benchmarks, they are usually slower than the Nvidia counterpart, but still within playable frame rates.  

Having a good CPU/RAM/Motherboard combo is important as the CPU can bottleneck the GPU, if the Video card is faster than what the CPU can handle.

Vram isn't quite as important at 1080p as most games will flirt with 2gb of Vram or go just a touch over.  1440p will be near the 4gb mark, and 4k will be even higher. [Here](http://www.tweaktown.com/tweakipedia/89/much-vram-need-1080p-1440p-4k/index.html) is a benchmark you can look over.

Depending on how long your upgrade cycle is, you might be forced to buy higher than what you actually need, to get more life out of your card.  Getting a card with more Vram and a stronger processor would keep the card relevant for a little longer than one with less of both.  

Some people only buy Green team (Nvidia) or red team (AMD), but if that doesn't matter to you, than looking at overall performance and price is what you should do.  [Here](http://www.anandtech.com/show/10446/the-amd-radeon-rx-480-preview/4) is another benchmark that you can compare cards to each other, then go look at your seller to see what they would cost you shipped (amazon, newegg, ncix, whatever).  Just because one card is besting another by a few fps, doesn't mean it will be a noticeable difference if the prices are far enough a part for your taste.  Take for example, if you play tomb raider at 1080p.  The 970 and rx480 are right next to each other.  That'd be your choice between 8gb of vram from the 480 or 3.5+500mb from the 970.  The nano doesn't justify the price, nor does the 390x as you are playing at 1080p and not a higher resolution.  The 970 is a great card, but doesn't have as much vram as the 480, and you can get the same vram as the 970 for even less than the 970 is being sold for. Your call though.

Playing games with mods can increase the needed vram you wouldn't normally need in a vanilla type game without the mods.  If you are a heavy skyrim mod user, you might need more than 2gb of vram at 1080p.",2016-07-05 22:32:45+00:00,d50mf9s,1.0,t3_4rf4ri,2168.0,IWantToLearn

Your body will eventually get used to not getting immediate energy and you'll, at least in my experience, stop feel weak even if you don't eat.

Scaling back once you now how your body is going to react is easier than trying to start something new while stressing your body by working out.  Once your body is adapted, you should feel fine in the mornings before your workouts.  You'll need to eat something fatty to get you through the night though so when you wake up, your body still feels good as it will still be in your digestive track at some point.

Add in bacon ends and pieces when making burgers.  I find them flavored with hickory, or you can add your own flavor with liquid smoke and spices.

You can pan fry ground beef, add in come onions and mushrooms, then afterwards, add in some cream cheese and miss it all together.  Makes a very hearty lunch.  Keeps me full for six+ hours.

I would get [This](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824106003&amp;nm_mc=AFC-C8Junction&amp;cm_mmc=AFC-C8Junction-PCPartPicker,%20LLC-_-na-_-na-_-na&amp;cm_sp=&amp;AID=10446076&amp;PID=3938566&amp;SID=) monitor as it could save you some money for basically the same specs.  You wont really notice the higher response time as that is .002 second difference (ms=millionth of a second).

Your storage could be shifted to something else, depending on your actual usage.  TB drives are constantly going down in price, as are SSD's.  I would opt for a 240gb ssd right now and save up money to get a 2/3tb drive down the road for movies or something.  This will help with load times and make you feel as if you spent your money well.  Fast bootup times and fast game load times as well.  You could even scavenge a drive from an old laptop or desktop to use as storage, provided you aren't storing irreplaceable things on it.  Always make backups and store those in different places if you can!

You don't need 16gb of ram unless you are doing something else other than gaming.  Are you running Virtual machines or something? If not, than get 8gb for the time being.  One 8gb stick or two 4gb should be enough as i've never gone over 8gb of usage with four games (bf4, sc2, metro, and need for speed) all running at the same time.  That was just a test btw to see if I could use up all my ram.  money can be saved here as well.

Your case, make sure it is what you want as you wont be getting rid of it for a long time.  I would get one with minimal exterior decoration (that grill in front) as adding LED fans to change the overall style of the case is easier than trying to do something with that grill.  Most seasoned builders opt for a simple case design with a window as the computer inside is the main showcase, not the case itself. Get it. showCASE? hahaha.....dumb joke :P

Your video card should be a second hand one as the new 400 series cards are coming out that should be a significant increase in performance.  Buying one now would be a mistake, unless you do not have on at all, and need it.  I'm sure you can find a $50 one online and use that for the time being.  600 series on up Nvidia cards have some dx12 features along with some amd cards (I am unsure of what series supports dx12) do as well.  Find a $40-70 gpu and use that for the time being.  Once the 400 series comes out, slave the $40-70 card with the 400 series card (if you get one) so you can get a minimal boost in fps in dx12 games (explicit gpu teaming or something they call it).

If you aren't planning on getting more than one card, you could downsize your mobo (motherboard) to a mATX board or similar as you are paying for that feature.  If you are, than you should stick to this one as I like it too and suggested it as a build for someone else I know.  As of right now, your motherboard is an ATX form factor and has extra PCI slots for expansion.

I like EVGA brand PSUs.  I think I actually have this same model...I trust it wont burn my house down....hopefully lol.

178,"meal prep sundays /r/MealPrepSunday is what I basically do.  Make and prep my food on sunday, package it up so I have 2/3 of my macros at work and finish my day with the remaining 1/3 of my macros.  I also freeze it as I have access to a microwave and make about a week and a half worth of food, depending on the bulk packaging I get at the store.

I buy my meat in the biggest, bulk sizes the store has, sometimes they are in bags of 10lbs+ for burger and 7lbs+ for chicken thighs.  Pork shoulder comes in 10lbs+ chunks or I get the big ass packages of pork chops.  Sausage and bacon also come in large package of 3lb package of bacon ends and pieces.  Sausage comes in 4lb+ packages.

Depending on how much liquid funds you have, you can stop by jimmy johns, carls jr, wendy's, or something similar and get yourself a burger without the bun.  Jimmy johns has some sandwich, that you can make an ""unwich"" that is just a lettuce wrapped sammitch.  The other options are either lettuce wrapped, at carls jr, or bunless in a bowl like at wendy's.  Going to safeway to the deli might also be a good spot as you can get a dark meat bucket for....around $7-8.  Good shit.  If you work with someone else, you might be able to get them to split the bill on that bucket as it is an eight piece meal for four lol.  If you are really hard up and can't get to a microwave to save some monies. You can go to the deli near closing time and buy the remaining chicken they have that will, most likely, get thrown out anyways for cheap. I got like, the whole tray of wings for $4 once. Ended up being like 60 wings or something.  Divide those up into your macro servings and just bring them with you the day after.

Another option is to eat the biggest breakfast you can while still remaining mobile for your work.  That will all depend on what you do and how mobile you need to be.  That meal should consist of mostly high fat meats though, as you will be feeling the most full from that, over high protein meats.  When I do this, I can make it about six or so hours before I start to feel a tiny bit hungry, and a small snack of cheese or something fatty holds me over until dinner at six (8am-6pm) for the remaining macros.  Those meals are mostly bacon, cheese, and burger or something topped with full fat mayo.  It's a big as fuck burger, but that and bacon are my only protein sources for this meal.

in my teens, I didn't care about who they were, but what they looked like.  I had a few crushes that I fell in love with for who they were.  I'm even friends with them on FB (when I talk to them, I revert back to that high school kid....I hate it) and found out that is what I actually wanted.  Some girls look great, but end up being ugly people on the inside.  That isn't something I want to wake up too.  That isn't something I want to bring into my life, as it turns toxic in time.  That all depends on how ugly they are and how well they are at hiding it.

in my early 20's, I started to learn towards the nice girl, that was friends with everyone.  Usually pretty in their own right, but a nice person.  I found that a sense of humor is a must though, as things become stale if you can't laugh...still like the chesty, bubble butt girls, but that isn't as important as it once was.  Having a good personality is what I want.

late 20's, I am looking for a girl that I can be friends with.  That has a warm smile and is everything I'm not.  that ""other half"" type crap you hear growing up...Trust, humor, and intellect are the biggest personality traits I am most interested in.  Two of three is great, but all three are ideal.  I want someone who is going somewhere, as I don't want to drag someone with me.  Money isn't important like having the hunger for something more than what you already have.  Even if helping people and not making money is your thing, as long as you have a hunger for it, that's good enough for me.

It's weird looking back at the girls I used to like to the ones I like now...the ones I like now are the ones I thought were boring or didn't look attractive enough.  Those are the ones I should have spent my time on rather than looking for the best looking ones.  ",2016-05-20 16:46:15+00:00,d3d3ti9,1.0,t3_4k7d2a,28365.0,AskReddit

205,"look for cover.  Why? Some bullets are likely to hit that than it is to hit you, so you have more time to react.  Also, short burst of whatever it is you are using.  SMG's are short/medium ranged.  Single shots if you are shooting someone at a long range type, but it is better to just close the distance and get them within your effective range.

Sniper rifles, you'll have to just practice.  Lead the targets and compensate for bullet drop (depending on how far they are).

LMG's are a good two/three round burst for short/medium range and pretty decent single round shots at medium/long range.  If you have a bipod, than you are good for longer bursts of five or so (depending on what you have).

DMR's are ok, but you will usually have to double tap to get kills, unless you are good at aiming for the head (your stats tell me you likely aren't, just yet).  Some DMR's are triple taps to kill, but they are usually fast shots. I personally have the most luck with certain recitals over others, so you'll have to try them all to see what ones your eyes see the best.  I like the open cross hair where I can put them in the middle and have nothing in the way (+ without the center).

Assault rifles are good at medium range with a little bleed over into long/short.  They are good for close combat and only take a few shots to kill, but usually have decent recoil to go along with it.  You'll have to find a gun with the stats that match your playstyle as some shoot slower, but are more powerful than others with a fast shot with low damage.  It all depends on if you panic a lot.

Shot guns are great for short range with some effective attachments that make it decent at medium range as well.  I am good at putting the crosshair on the body, so I use full choke and the darts as I usually use this type of fun in meat grinder maps (metro/lockers).  The darts will go through the first target and hit the second.  They do less damage, but it works for how I play.  Lots of people can use no choke and buck shot though.

Carbines are less powerful assault rifles.  They are good for nearly the same things as the assault rifles with a little bit faster shotperminute.  If it suites your playstyle, try these out.

If you are looking to get good as infintry, play DM/TDM servers on either ""normal"" or hardcore.  You'll die a lot at first, but you'll get used to reacting really fast as the maps are smaller and they come at you, mostly, from all sides.  Get to cover. Run along the wall behind boxes and stuff (if not blown up).

My goal is 240 and I am so close from where I started at 390....this is a lifestyle change. Not a diet until you get what you want.  Eat pizza on special occasions and only in moderation.

216,"skin is fairly thin, for what it is.  That extra flab you have is still fat, it is just the remaining fat you have.  Once you lose that fat, the skin should get closer to your muscles, but still have some give to it.  It will be stretchy like a balloon that was inflated to its max and then deflated. It will shrink, but it will still have that extra give to it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAoYRf_tTwE

I found this video that shows that it is still there, but it will mostly contract back.  Over time is when the actual shrinking happens, when you keep the weight off over the course of years.

That is what I am telling myself anyways. I am on the same boat as you, telling myself that it will get better.  I started at 396.6 and I am down to 273lbs today.  I have a lot of flab still but, I remain hopeful that when the fat under the skin is gone, it will just be loose skin and not a tongue like on ""click""....",2016-04-28 17:19:27+00:00,d2kx8bl,1.0,t3_4gsxtc,35548.0,loseit

218,"you are going to need to try out some seasonings.  You can try easy ones that usually taste alright on their own like; Italian seasoning (that is what is on the bottle), garlic and/or onion powder (if you do or don't like either), soy sauce (gives it a different tang if you are looking for salt content), Worcestershire sauce (a taste all its own....experiment with it though. You might not like it as much as I), normal and dark chili powder (I really can't tell the difference between the two....), and black or fresh ground pepper.

When I cook burger, I mix onion powder, garlic powder, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, Parmesan cheese (gotta try that...yumm!), and sometimes red chili powder or paprika if I want some spice going on.  The measurements are just eye-balled, but you experiment with them to find out how much you want in your mix.  After it is all mixed up into a paste, I add the burger and mix it together in a bowl and then bake them in the oven (I make about 10lbs at a time....).  When I make chicken thighs, I mix everything except the cheese and Worcestershire sauce and add a little bit of water and pepper. good stuff.  You can even add bbq sauce to a plain onion and garlic sauce when making ribs, if you'd like.  Let the seasonings sit for at least 30 minutes to get a nice penetration, or over night if you aren't in a rush to get deep penetration of taste ;)",2016-04-28 15:22:17+00:00,d2krusp,1.0,t3_4grl7b,52151.0,MealPrepSunday

To solve this, I installed five 140mm fans that intake and one as an exhaust (corsiar 750d) so the air would be positive inside the case and would want to go out any hole they could.

295,"depends on you. The cheapest you can get a 970, is around $305 and performs in the same ballpark as the 390x.  The cheapest for the 390x is $373 but has 8gb of memory and would be a decent choice for higher resolutions than 1080p because of that.

So, if you game at 1080p, than the 970 would be the, imo, best choice. If you game at higher resolutions like 1440p/1600p/4k than the 390x would be the better choice. The 970 can still run great at 1440p and 1600p, but once you start adding better looking textures, it starts to show its weakness.  Right now, at 1080p, most games just go over the 2gb vram usage, and at 4k it gets to just over the 3.5gb the 970 has.

If you have an android phone (I wouldn't doubt IPHONE would have this too) find an app that you can see wifi ssid's.  Install it and find your wifi signal.  See if it is sharing the same channel as some that are around you.  This will also show you the signal strength of your wifi.  Wifi can only be on certain channels. 1-12 and they bleed over one on each side. So if on channel 3, you will see some of it on channel 2 and 4. Along with channel 1, you will kind of see it on 0 (I guess) and 2. Too many wifi's on the same channel is similar to having a room full of people trying to talk at the same time.  Move the channel from (usually 6) what it is on to a less populated one or with the weakest signals from other wifi's.

The best sale deals are in costco and safeway, but saars ends up being the cheapest on average to get most of my meat on a normal day. But sometimes I can get meats cheaper at safeway if you look at the physical paper when you walk in or in your mail.  That sometimes has deals on it that are not obvious like, save $15 when you spend $50. That was a very small, but very useful coupon when I found it a few months ago. I got so much hamburger and chicken that day because that same week, I found chicken breast there for $1.99 a pound and burger for $2.20 a pound.

When I need meat though, I usually go to saars and check it out. So far, the prices only go up or down by .30 cents and even then, they are still cheaper than safeway and costco's prices.  Most of the brands in that store are off brands or best western, but if you know what you are doing in the kitchen, it wont matter.  I think everything ends up being cheaper because they buy and package everything locally. That is what the packaging and way the meat looks anyways.

331,"get yourself a slow cooker, a decent cookie sheet/baking sheet, get good at seasoning, and make damn sure you have lots of room in your freezer. Get yourself some containers also. I have some rubbermaid ""easy find"" lids that I use the large and medium sized ones for my breakfast and lunches.  Do not use eggs in your meals as microwaving them does something to them. FDA does not recommend microwaving them. I stopped since they come out weird tasting.  Buy things in 8lb+ things. Thighs have more fat in them than the breast, and are usually cheaper. Pork butt/boston butt/pork shoulder is great for pulled pork.  You can do the same thing with a beef roast, but it will be more expensive.  If you get a roasting oven, you can slow cook an entire turkey, bones and everything else you want, and that should give you around a weeks worth of lunches (about six days for me).

I cook, mainly, by baking and slow cooking. Not often will I cook a weeks worth of food, breakfast or lunch, on the stove top. Takes too long. I takes about three hours to do that rather than baking everything that only takes the prep time and the 30-45 minutes to bake. Slow cooking can be done vary easily on saturday night or anytime saturday and prep'd sunday.

I usually make about nine or so days worth of food, because that is just how much I buy when at the store. The largest amounts of food I get are around 18lbs, but that is pulled pork and I cut that into 6lb chunks for each week.

Most of the time, you wont find a crock pot that will fit that size of cut in it. I use this to roast my pulled pork.  The temps for ""low"" and ""High"" are 180 for ""Low"" and 220 for ""High"". I use around 220-240 to cook it up and it comes out great.

333,"Hi. You should try using condensed onion/mushroom soup, a fresh onion, fresh garlic (unless you use a ton of it. Then the pre-diced ones are good), and make your own mix.  I like using soy sauce, worechester sauce, onion powder (even with actual onions in the mix), garlic powder (same reason as onion), condensed soup, chili powder, and sometimes pepper. Fresh ground or the normal black.  Also, if you cook it right, you can shred the meat with a wooden or metal spoon. Just stir it.  If it takes more than a spoon to shred the meat, than you did not cook it long enough.

Another thing I like to do is to shred the meat and let it sit in the jucies for a couple of hours after that. Gets the flavor good and deep in the meat. yum factor +2. :)",2016-01-11 17:09:08+00:00,cyu71dc,1.0,t3_40de5v,69825.0,slowcooking

335,"be warned you lose about 40% of your overall speeds due to the heavy encryption they use. No one will know what you are doing, and it is highly doubtful anyone can scan what you are doing. But that is the overhead of their encryption. My top speed is 2.8mbps (I know...crawling) and I get around 1-1.8mbps using the VPN. I just bought another year though. Haven't gotten a letter for torrenting and I have downloaded 1.5tb of stuff.

They have a client that you can use that is similar to PIA's where it creates another network connection. Click on the application, pick your server (or let it pick one for you), then wait for it to say you are connected. That's it.  They have lots of servers in different countries and they do not have a speed or data cap of any kind (that I know of).  They even have a speed test for the VPN tunnel that is created.

I am sticking with them because I have not gotten any kind of letter from my ISP (centurylink DSL) about what I am doing.  It does work for torrenting, but I am sure it works for anything else.

341,"Do the seasoning process. Whatever oil you are using, I use coconut, put it in there after a good cleaning. Dish soap and sponge. The whole nine.  wipe it dry or throw that puppy on the range/oven. DOn't let it air dry as it could start to rust. Now you heat it up and throw in the oil you want to use. Some guides says use a paper towel or something to smear it all over. I didn't. I just picked it up and tilted the pan until it got to where I wanted it. I kept doing that, adding more, and getting the oil all over the cooking surface until it started to smoke. Once it starts to smoke, take it off the heat and let it cool down to room temp.  I put mine outside after that on a cooling tile so I didn't have to deal with all the smoke. Do this one or two more times. It will still get a tiny bit sticky. That's good.Everytime you cook, add a tiny bit of oil. When I cook, I noticed a film over the top like, old fat or something. I wanted this. I sometimes put extra oil into it after I am done cooking, and after it is clean-ish, to make sure any oil I did scrape off gets back on there.

don't cook eggs on it for a while. It wont work out well. Cook other things without seasonings for a bit since everything will stick. When you get your pan looking like that, get a little bit of water in there to get it all of the way out. No soap though. If you use seasonings, they might bake on there and create sticky spots where your food will stick. Wait until you almost don't need oil to cook without your food sticking to cook eggs. Those fuckers are a bitch to get off of these things. I hated cooking with my cast iron until I learned this.

It will fall apart like most of the things I slow cook do, and it will use what you have.  Make sure to check on it and mix it up. Get them juices and pour them all over the meat.

535,"You have two different types of squatting. High bar and low bar squatting.

High bar squatting, your legs are going to stay fairly vertical. The reason is that you don't have to lean too far forward to keep the bar above your heels while squatting. Your ankles shouldn't move very much during this whole movement.

Low bar squatting your ankles are going to bend some, along with the rest of your leg and even lean forward a little bit. The reason is you are trying to keep the bar above your heels and during this whole movement, your ankles are going to have a bend in them. This workout helps develop your lower back, hamstrings, and gluts.

With both of these types of squats, you want to have your legs about shoulder width apart, maybe even a little bit more depending on how you're built. You also want to point your toes out a little. Like a penguin walk. Just only slightly though. It took me a whole lot of adjustments to even figure out where I want my feet so I can get deep.

One thing I did was to balance on my heels and then try to get as low as I could. Once I got that low, I would lower my toes and try using that stance. If it didn't work, I'd widen my feet and balance on my heels again. Keep doing that until I found how far they need to be out so i can get a deep squat.",2015-10-06 15:51:42+00:00,cvq6mj9,1.0,t3_3npgyf,6968.0,ketogains

555,"80/20 burger $4 a lb at costco (usually). Sometimes it is $3.50 a lb but not often.

Eggs. 5 dozen for $9-10 at costco. $11 at safeway

chicken breast $2 a lb at safeway on sale. Chicken thighs $2.50 when breast isn't on sale

Safeway brand sausage $3-3.50 a tube. Most of the time this brand is the cheapest. not always. But a lot of the times. I am talking about the larger tubes that aren't already ""links"".

Pork shoulder/butt is usually $3 a lb from either costco or safeway. Wont pay more than $4 though

Beef roast is about $2.75 a lb at safeway. Wont pay more than $3.25 a lb

Bacon varies. I wont pay more than $5 a package though. Depends on who's on sale.

The steaks I eat I usually go to the clearance section of meat. That is where they are usually trying to get rid of the meat that is near or on the sell date. I find steaks that are 30-50% most of the time. Just picked up two boneless rib-eyes and two Filet Mignon steaks at 30% off for everything. They will last a few days after cooking if you buy them on the sale date. But I also wouldn't hesitate to cook them after a day or two sitting in the fridge. I cook then freeze them for later eating when I buy out of that bin.

Various spices I use. Soy sauce, $15 for two 15 oz bottles of worcester sauce, $8 onion/garlic powder, $8 cayenne powder, pepper, salt, $7 chili powder, and some kind of grill seasonings I bought on sale at walmart last year for like $2 a bottle. Small bottle, but $2 for a bunch of flavor.

556,"You can go to the bank. You can also check out credit unions. They are owned by the members and aren't really in it for money like a bank would be (BoA or Chase). They offer many of the same benefits and sometimes more. Keep both accounts in the same bank/credit union so you can just transfer it over from savings/checking to your line of credit when you need to.

If you need that $400 if your truck breaks down, I bet your parents will still have it. You said they aren't hurting for monies so I doubt they would do something like spend it the day you give it to them.

College would give you direction like going to the military would. So many things to do and learn. Something for everyone. Also, you being reimbursed sounds good and all, but you are still without that money until you get the reimbursement check. That being said, stay with your parents until you get to around $17 an hour so you can handle unexpected hurdles easier on your own.


Your separate checking idea is a good one. But you can be charged for a lot of ""activity"" if you are always there transfering money from savings to checking. A really stupid fee. Another thing you can do is put some money away and don't touch it. Since you have no other debt/bills to really speak of. Put 60% away and try to live off of 40%. That might be around where you would be living on if you moved out. get used to it.

557,"I would suggest to go to some sort of college and stay with your parents. Getting an education is the most reliable way to get a better job some place that isn't considered a trade (mechanic, electrician, plumber or something like that) and you could also get scholarships too. The sooner you get that done, the sooner you'll be able to advance upwards towards more monies and stuff. I'm 27 and I just started going back to school. I have a full time job and I am also going as a full time student. It kind of sucks to the point that I regret not doing it sooner when I did live with my mom.

If you owe someone, I'd pay them off all at once. I hate being nickled and dimed as it feels like I am being disrespected. Once that is done, all the money you make after that is yours alone. Start saving up, if you do end up moving out since everything can get very expensive very fast.

If you are handy with a wrench, than keep that old truck of yours and fix it up down the road. You'd save more money fixing it yourself than buying new most of the time. If you are not, then you might have to buy a new car/truck soon depending on how much you are actually driving and what happens when something breaks. I'd save up a few thousand just for that. You'll need to save for a deposit and last months rent. That's usually 1500-2500$. Furniture is also kind of expensive if you are buying it all yourself. Easy $2000 if you want to buy most of it new or only slightly used.

You build credit by opening an line of credit, like a low limit credit card, and using it. Then you pay that bill early or on time. Or some other type of borrowing/loan and paying on time. Go to a bank you like, or better yet, a credit union and try to open up a student credit card or something. Use that card for gas and wait a week or so, then pay it off with your money you earned. Don't get a card more than $500 though. it is really easy to just keep charging that card than you'd think. In a couple of months, if you paid on time, you can ask for a higher line of credit.

586,"if you have to change anything on the front of the engine, you usually have to remove the wheel, fender well, and sometimes the suspension on that side you are doing the work. That takes time and shop time isn't cheap. By that, I mean the alternator, Air conditioning, power steering pump, and water pump. The parts aren't all that much more expensive. but if you aren't doing the work yourself, you are paying shop time and that can range from 60-150$ depending on where you go and what is all being worked on. Also, if your transmission goes out, you have to drop the whole front end. Wheels, steering, suspension, and disconnect everything to get to the transmission. Again, that's time and money.

Rear wheel drive cars/trucks/vans don't have to worry about that since the drivetrain is spread out over the whole rest of the car. And not crammed into an engine bay. Also, with a rear wheel drive car, you just need to get enough room underneath to remove the transmission and disconnect everything connected to the transmission to drop it. Simpler process. Less time, which means less money you spend.

Now if you do the work yourself or get good-guy pricing, then it wouldn't be that bad of an idea. Not saying front wheel drive cars wont last as long as rear wheel drive cars. But they will fail, and if you want to keep it. You will be spending more to fix it over a rear wheel drive car.

So, in the end. They will still both cost you money to fix. But one will cost more to fix over the other depending on who is fixing it and if you are paying them to fix it. The parts are going to be in the same ballpark though. It's the labor that gets you that no one thinks about.",2015-09-23 18:42:04+00:00,cvbnap6,3.0,t1_cvbl1ad,3245.0,personalfinance

I'd say a 5k chevy/ford with less than 100k miles will last you 5-ish years depending on how you drive and how much you drive. Don't get front wheel drive as those are spendy when fixing. Similar story with all wheel drive and 4x4's.

624,"Ok. we can go two different routes here. One, you buy all your shit off amazon or some store (safeway or dollar store depending on how much green you trying to save) pre-packaged and cooked. Or you can still go to safeway/costco/dollar store and buy everything, but cook it yourself.

If you wanted to go pre-packaged. You can find some summer sausage/salami and some pepperoni sticks (turkey or beef) for your proteins and fats. One of those big ass bags of chips. The mission brand. Get some ziplock bags and divide those up. I buy my salami/summer sausage and turkey sticks from amazon using the subscribe and save option. Brings them down to about safeway prices (the ones I've seen around me) but keeps me from impulse buying. Ends up saving me money lol. The sizes I buy are; 11oz summer sausage and 8oz turkey sticks. I know safeway and costco sell those big bags of chips. So that is a 4-8$ price range depending on how much you like them chips lol. that would be about 7-10$ a day for breakfast and lunch. Or about 5$ a day just for lunch.

If you wanted to save some more money, you could go to the dollar store and get some vienna sausage (2 for 1$ at my dollar store), potted meat, bread, and whatever else would float your boat. Everything is a dollar there lol.

If you can cook, or you are willing to teach yourself. Then go to the store and pick up some hamburger (I like 80/20 because it tastes better to me), pork (shoulder, chops, ribs, or whatever. It is usually cheaper option than beef but more expensive than chicken), and/or chicken (cheapest option, but is very low fat so you'd have to add your own). Those things are going to keep you from getting hungry for the day (fats and proteins). Now your carbs are optional, (I am assuming you want to try the keto diet....) get yourself some veggies you like to snack on. I like carrots, peanuts, almonds, celery, broccoli, and cauliflower. You can steam those and just eat them cold later or just wash'em and then eat them with a dip of your choosing. Per day, this should be around 3-7$ because you aren't paying someone else to cook it and package it for you. But it kind of relies on your ability to cook and not give yourself food poisoning. but that isn't hard to learn how to cook.

Now for those options, you will have to figure out what you like to eat yourself and how much of everything you'd like to eat. The estimates are for myself at 3800 calories, so your daily cost should be lower. My carb limited, I set for myself, is 50g. It is just an easier number to not go over and I still lose weight. Lost 120lbs so far and loving it. Any questions or if you wanted to see peoples progress. Head on over to /r/keto and look around. The FAQ's are a great place to get more information that can explain it better than I can. ANd if you had a problem reading this, it is because I never could write anything well in my life lol. But I'm learning :).


Now for a non-keto diet. I would get mostly bread, chips, crackers, and rice. They are very, very cheap and goes with anything well. I would get some cheese, deli meat, peanut/almond/hazelnut spread/butter, and salsa to put on those things in whatever combination you like. Peanuts are a good side item and snack too. Love me some peanuts :). If you don't already have a costco or sam's club membership, look into it. They sell large quantities of things. Rice in 25lb bags. Chips in 3lbs bags (mission chips). Soda in 30-36 packs. This ends up saving you money if you have a little room to store it all. Meat is a very high quality compared to safeway (in my experience anyways) too and if you have the room in the freezer. Get some. You could easily spend $120 per visit, but each visit would only be around once or twice a month. Now that you know your maintenance calories, you will have to figure your your portions and what you plan on making yourself.

Rice can be eaten cold. Ground beef can also be eaten cold, just depends on how you prepare it. Same goes with any other meat I guess. Chips and crackers can be put in ziplock bags or something.

you will need some sort of storage containers though. I like [These guys](http://www.amazon.com/Rubbermaid-Easy-Storage-Plastic-42-Piece/dp/B00COK3FD8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1442248071&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=rubbermaid). They are cheap and you get just about everything you'd need for a couple of days worth of foods. Buy two or so and you wont have to worry about how much food you make per cooking session. I bought three because I go overboard sometimes and have like 12 days worth of breakfast and lunches. They also stack well since the bottoms of the containers lock/snap into the lids if stacked and pressed down. Plastic, but heavy duty too. Haven't had one break yet.

We are only 3% or so (right?) of the market share. Best bet would be to get a no-contract phone that supports what your carrier uses. Also, the unlocked ones can be used on other carriers if you buy them like that. They tend to have a higher price though. I have a 635 and enjoy it. I bought it from ATT as a ""Go phone"" though. But I am scheming to get that 640 as it has just about everything I'd want. Other than it only having 1gb of ram :(.

edit: It would appear that your phone doesn't use the 700mhz frequency :( That is really weird....But you have a bunch of other phones that do. And they could work on another network. Maybe you could buy the 640 and have it unlocked, to see if it works with Tmo netowork. I would use amazon and send it back if it didn't work to your liking. They are good with returns.

Get both or talk to them to see how much two lines from either (two from ATT or two from Comcast) would cost together.

778,"1. Lose weight

2. A year and Five months

3. I lost over 100lbs (105lbs so far. But I hit a plateau and bounce back up five pounds)

4. Finding way to eat my peanut butter (this is huge for me...). Having to tell people that I am not allergic to flour/sugar/starch, but removed it from my diet for high fat/protein to lose weight. Buying almonds (expensive fuckers). Not having snack foods like I used to like chips, crackers, and sandwiches (tear)

5. Lost lots of weight. Had been forced to cook more often. I look at the nutritional panel on the back way more often when buying foods/ingredients. I learned that I can go very long periods of time without eating. My snacks changed. Everything that includes a slight amount of sugar, is very sweet now. I can't go to mexican/italian joints anymore (sucks).

6. Learning how to season foods along with paring them together. Trying to not get grease everywhere when cooking bacon. Trying to keep eggs from sticking to my cast iron pan. 

If you want to get the exact micros, weighting stuff. I don't do that anymore though. Too much of a pain to do.

7. I would not. I could totally see how this would help some people though. My mom wants to do that kind of stuff. She's kind of lazy so she is more than willing to pay someone to prepare her meals for her. I like my meals fresh with charr (the black you get from frying food in frying pan or on the BBQ), and with my own seasonings. 

But, if I had wanted it. I would want the ingredients shipping to me, cooked. Frozen or chilled. Why? so I can warm them up at work or on the go. 

I would improve the service depending on how often they where delivered, what kind of packaging they arrived in, seasonings used in meal prep, the choices in foods included in meal package (if I did or did not like a certain food. I would want it removed from the package if I got a heads up before hand), and to give ideas or the recipe if I chose to make it myself.

8. I would love it. The closest Ketogenic places I have are buffets or steak joints. Which are great, but also serve lots of starches and flour type sides (except the Buffet). You would have to have a side menu for the people that don't eat Keto so they have something they enjoy also. ""I don't want to go their because they don't have what I want. They have weird tasting buns and no fries..."" would be a big deal for some. A keto heavy menu, and not a purely keto menu would be best. It's like going to a steak restaurant and having someone order the burger. It isn't something you go their for, but they have a choice in the matter and enjoy eating their as much as you are enjoying your steak.

9. Go to as many of the useful keto websites and combine them somehow. But not run them, just combine them to pool the money/resources together and have them funneled to one page. Like a forum page but have it referenced to their specific page somewhere and a link ""to check out more recipes/ideas like this one. Bounce on over to (whatever).com!!"".

823,"Ok. when looking for a car, you can look for a few things. Front wheel drive cars are very hard to work on. If you need to change an alternator or water pump, you are removing the wheel and whatever else is in the way to get to that stuff. That is time, and time is money.

Look for a rear wheel drive car. They are easier to work on and usually have ample engine compartment room. Some don't, but mostly, they do. The transmissions are also stronger since they don't have to be compact as much. They still can become a problem, but you wont have as much fitment issues or people unwilling to work on it. Since removing a front wheel drive transmission requires removing the whole front suspension and wheels. Also the whole engine might have to come out. Depending on how the car was made. Most of the time not, but you still need to remove a lot of the front end. A rear wheel drive car, you can just drop the transmission. Sounds easy, but it is far easier than a front wheel drive car.

Domestic cars are easier for most people to work on because, if you are a mechanic, you more than likely grew up working on a domestic car. The parts are easier to find for either though. Unless it is an old mercedes or BMW. Those parts are still going to be hard to find since not a whole bunch of people had those cars to begin with.

Depending on the size of the motor, how many miles it has on it will determine if the car is worth a certain amount. 200k miles on a inline 4 gasser or a diesel motor isn't anything. Those engines seem to run forever. 200k on a v/inline 6 or a v8 gasser, then you might start to run into problems. It all depends on how the person before you took care of the car. But I wouldn't buy a car with more than 120k miles on it without second guessing myself. I bought a 2004 silverado 1500 with 112k miles on it and it has gotten me to 180k without any huge problem. But it also depends on the engine. Chevy engines (and even foods/ford) tend to last forever, if they remain stock, and are simply taken care of. I trust my truck to last until an easy 200k, but no more than 230k miles. I have a camaro with 79k miles on it and, once I figure out the rough idle, would assume a reliable 180k miles out of it afterwards. Honda makes very good small engines that would easily go north of 150k. 

When you go to test drive the car, make sure the engine is cold. Any weird noises are going to show up on a cold start and while warming up. If it runs fine warm, but has a weird ass noise when starting up/warming up. Then all they would have to do is warm it up before you test drove it, then sell it to you. Drive it hard. Not into a tree or anything. But floor it, safely, while getting onto the freeway and do a hard stop. The engine will give you performance problems then, or a light will come on if it isn't at tip top shape. A problem at Wide Open Throttle means problems down the road with something else. Breaking, without hearing the tires screech is also a good idea. That will tell you if the breaks are good or need replacing. That, in itself can cost north of 1,000 to fix (depending on if the rotors/drums need replacing along with the calipers and shoes/pads). Don't go overboard though. Pretend you are trying to stop at an unexpected light or a stop on the highway. Just before the screeching.

Go over some bumps like train tracks to listen for suspension noises too. Not a huge deal to fix, but something you don't want to hear down the road. It could be a safety issue, but you more than likely would notice that just driving around.

Now for pricing. Depending on where you live, and what you would normally see during the year. Cars are going to go for different prices. Hondas/toyotas are generally cheaper, but are normally front wheel drive cars. They are very plentiful though, and lots of young adults/kids know how to work on them and the aftermarket for those kinds of cars are still fairly big. Finding parts to fix and/or upgrade wouldn't be any difficult at all. Chevys/Fords are going to be a little bit more pricey, but you are more than likely going to find a rear wheel drive car with those two. I'm not a big dodge/chrysler person, but they aren't as popular. They aren't horrible cars/trucks, I just prefer chevy (and even food) over them.

Where I live, I can find a honda sedan for 2500-3000 from 150k-200k miles on it. I just searched and seen one with 310k for 3000$ (fuck that guy though. 3k for that. pfft). I just found a jeep for 2k that has 99k miles on it. I would look at private sellers first, and bring your mechanic with you if you can.

marinate the meat before you cook it if you have the time.  Slow cooking it is always good. Make sure it is a fatty cut though. Or you add enough fat to it, so it falls apart.

I just LOVE coconut oil to cook with. Smells great and I like how it makes the food taste sweeter. yumm. I also liked cooking with butter that didn't have salt added to it.

I still have my windows phone that I use for everything else. I carry whatever tablet I want in a backpack with me along with the chargers.

I game, mostly on my windows tablet since I can install steam and other computer/desktop programs on it with no problem.

Well the display port not working is just the monitor saying it doesn't have a signal (computer is sending a video image to it), but is still plugged into a port.

How long did you wait until you turned it off using the PSU? If the LEDs were still working, than your computer might have been still trying to end those processes. How could you not get to the task manager?

898,"I failed in the beginning but I found another program. I started just lifting random weights because I couldn't do anything big like I used to. Then I found stronglifts 5x5 and then I plateaued out. Altered it a bit and now I feel like I am gaining again. strong lifts is 5x5 three-four days a week. Squats, dead, overhead, bent over row, and bench. Squats everyday with alternating between dead/bench one day and overhead/row another. Changed the reps from 5x5 to 3x12 with a minute rest in between. What I am finding out (with my own body) is that you can't go 100% every week. You will hit a wall. That is when you learn and start over. Get better. I am strong than when I started Keto. But I had to fall back a tiny bit (compared to where I am now) to move forward. You can do it without the extra carbs. But that is what I used to keep myself going in the gym when I am going for about an hour and a half of heavy lifts. Drenched in sweat and out of breath.

I never was worried about staying in ketosis. As long as I ate the right way, I will lose weight. So far, I've lost 95lbs from when I started ketosis eating the extra carbs. But I have been going to the gym three times a week, sometimes four for a minimum of an hour and a half lifting heavy weights (at least to me).  The day to day, it doesn't have an effect my energy or my weight. Well it mostly doesn't. AS long as I am able to only consume a tiny bit more carbs a day. I have impulse control issues lol. I go overboard with eating too much of the ""evil"" carbs. If you want. I could try and go a week with as minimal carbs as I could to see what happens. I have been in ketosis (so I think) for a while now. Shouldn't do much. 

I felt there was a need to add carbs to my diet when I would be working out and got incredibly hungry mid-way through. I added more cheese/mayo to my eggs/bacon/sausage and it didn't help. So I added a slice of bread or some crackers and it seems to hold the tide back until I got home. So an hour or so before I go hit the gym, I get a hand full of crackers or something. I haven't strayed away from that since its worked so far. But I guess I could try it tomorrow without any carbs.

899,"I used to feel like this. Raise your carbs some. I used to limit myself to 30g a day but felt horrible and didn't feel like lifting. Now I have it at 50g a day (mostly dont' get to this limit though) and feel better. I am a 290lb man though. Raise your carbs up 5g to see what helps. When I first started Keto, I slowly did it over the course of a month. Not full-bore 30g of carbs at the start, but I lowered my carb intake to meet the 30g over the course of a month.Some people say that food is a type of drug. So I treated it like a drug. I weaned myself off of the carb drug and got clean ;).

You could try looking at what you were eating before you started this new life-style and start you wean yourself from there. I started at 20g less than my daily intake. I can't remember what I was at since it has been over a year and a half. But I started at -20g a day and worked my way down 5/10g a week depending on how good I felt the previous week. I didn't lift though while in the transition as the ""Keto Flu"" would be something I would have had to deal with.

You don't have to meet your fat limit. Meet your protein limit and hover around your carb limit. Your fat limit might not ever be met, but that isn't a bad thing. I like to get my proteins from meat over nuts because of the extra fat nuts have in them. But going that route will ensure you get all the fat you could handle while getting the protein you NEED.

906,"No problem! Those programs are the ones I like to use so go a head and google/bing/yahoo/duck them to learn more about them and what they do best. Once you start, you will want to try them out. Do that one at a time on a computer you don't have critical data on/only computer in the house. You might need another computer as your ""medic"" to save you from something you tried. I know I have and still do (I have a laptop AND a battlestation/Dekstop PC) to save my bacon when I try something new. If you aren't sure about something. Search a few phrases or words and see what comes up on what you are trying to learn. Chances are, someone has already asked the question and found an answer/fix for your problem :). 

Here are two links

[Link1](http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/2h0yb9/its_about_time_i_posted_my_massive_list_of/) and [Link2](http://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/lgpv7/the_official_best_software_guide/)

that have a list of other programs you could take a look into. If you aren't sure about a program (you always should be wary) you can search it to find more out about it from people who posted about it. Don't just go and willy-nilly download everything just because a post says it's a good program. It might have been at one point in time, but things change and programs sometimes end up becoming crap-ware.

Where I started is at the hardware level. What is a motherboard, RAM stick, HDD, PowerSupply, GPU/Video card, and CD/DVD rom drive. Figure out what they are and how they work. That will give you ideas on what parts to buy in the future for more performance.

907,"Ninite.com is your friend. Go their and click the ones you want to download. It will download everything without you having to check/uncheck bloatware. Very easy website to navigate also. Once you use it, you will wonder how you got along without it before.

Trial versions of

Malwarebytes
cCleaner
superantispyware
glarys utilities

Use those to remove extra crap you might have accidentally installed (options you left checked when installing programs that are ""free"").

if you are using windows 7, hit the windows button/start button and type msconfig and navigate to the STARUP tab. Uncheck the things you don't use or want starting up. I disable java and adobe. Do some research on what is in their though as you might disable something you want to keep.

If you are using windows 8. Just open up task manager (right click the taskbar or CRTL+ALT+DELETE) and go to startup tabe. Do the same thing there.

get an anti virus. Kinguin.net sells 3/6/9/12 month subs to some of them. Amazon also sells older versions of the antivirus. But with bitdefender, you can upgrade the the current version. I bought 2012 and upgraded it to 2015 just using the key when it asked to register.

Depending on how proficient you are with the computer, you could also squeeze a little bit of performance out of your computer with registry edits and disabling features you don't use. Depends on what you mean by ""faster"" though as most of those regedit and feature disabling is for gaming type computers.

You can also change settings in your bios, but you might make it so the computer wont boot anymore. Depends on how much you are willing to read and learn about your computer.

If you want to spend money to increase speed. Than you will have to be ok with opening up your case and doing a little bit of work. 


You can check to see if your CPU is running hot with HWMonitor. It is on the same website as CPUz/CPU-id. I don't like my CPU getting above 70 degrees centigrade. If it gets too hot, it will slow itself down or your computer will bluescreen to keep itself from burning up. If you have a heat issue, buy some thermal paste (doesn't really matter whos. Arctic silver 7 is good though) and remove the old thermal paste with rubbing alcohol. Be careful not to get it all over though. Just enough to remove it. Reapply using about as much as a pea would be. Little less. Spread it around to the edges. Ensure the screws are tight. Not too tight or you will crack the motherboard. It might have clips. Make sure they are clicked in and secure. Clean out the fins with air. Canned air or using an air compressor on a low-ish settings (60-100psi is alright). Or enough to get the dust out. The free versions of CPU-ID/HWMonitor are good to use.

Open up task manager and go to performance. The second graph shows you your RAM usage. If it is more than 75% up, you will have performance issues if you open up anything else beyond what is already open. If you are gaming, and it is around that area. You should be fine. If you first start up your rig, and only let the things auto start. And you are in that area. You have problems and you will need to purchase more ram. CPU-ID will tell you what RAM you have. DDR2/3 (more than likely DDR3) and how much you have. Depending on how deep you want to reach into your pockets. You can upgrade to 2/4/8gb sticks from (if you need it) what you have now. Most motherboards have four slots if they are fullsized Some smaller (mATX/mITX) has only two. Some laptops only have one. RAM works best in teams, but you can buy only one stick at a time if money is an issue and install it.

You don't normally have to get an SSD, but they are getting cheaper by the month and are one of the best ways to get more performance out of your rig. Faster load times for any programs installed on the SSD, including O.S. You would have to re-install windows for that to get the best experience. You could make an image of your current hard drive and bring it over. But it depends on how proficient you are.
