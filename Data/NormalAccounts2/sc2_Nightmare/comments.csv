*Prompt #18:*

Twilight is trying to hide her relationship with [pick your favorite] from Starlight. Which is surprisingly difficult, given that her new student keeps cluelessly bursting into every room.

*Prompt #20:*

The reason as to why Luna did not show up during Cadance' and Shining Armors wedding was that her and Chrysalis are one and the same.

-That being said, do you really wish to see the plan of the guy that lost? The plan that failed? What point would there be in doing so? That plan failed. Because the writers said ""The ponies must win! Deploy the 'Magic Rainbow Rays'^^^^TM .""

-Also, the marticulous planning takes *more* assumptions?

Okay, fine let's assume she **is** a brilliant strategist and planned out every single detail, because we also assume, that she did her research on anypony that would be involved in a full scale invasion of Equestria. That includes the princesses, the guard captain, that can shield the entire capitol, and our dear Mane 6, because as the Elements of Harmony they are the greatest (defensive) weapon Equestria could bring to bear.

Now, let's pitch that against the other option: She is just damn lucky: How lucky, that Celestia didn't notice. How lucky, that Shining Armor didn't notice. How lucky, that none of the Mane 6, except for Twilight, didn't notice. How lucky, that noone believed Twilight. How lucky, that Twilight alienated all her friends trying to convince them that Cadance is evil. How lucky, that Twilight ended up in the same crystal caves Cadance was in. How lucky, Chrysalis' taunting enraged Twilight so much that she was ready to kill Cadance. How lucky, that the brides maids were down there protecting the exit. How lucky, that the drones managed to break through the shield at the exact moment Chrysalis' was done monologing. How lucky, that the drones engaged the Mane 6 on their way to the elements. How lucky, that even more changelings got to the elements room before the Mane 6.

So... uhm... yeah... That's an awful lot of luck. Noone is that lucky.

---------------------

But all of that aside, I agree. It would have been awesome to get confirmation that it was all part of her plan. Just a single throw away line. Like... I don't know...

*Prompt #16:*

During a trip to Las Pegasus it turns out one of the mane six (your pick) has a gambling addiction.

(Previously: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/4brsxu/ponymote_craziness_64/d1cd6xa))

-----------------------------------

*Prompt #17:*

Twilight has two earth pony friends and two pegasus friends, but **9** unicorn friends. Awefully one sided and unacceptable for the Princess of Friendship she finds. Ponies could think she might be racist. So she tries to make new earth pony and pegasus friends to even the balance.

-----------------------------------

*Prompt #18:*

Twilight is trying to hide her relationship with [pick your favorite] from Starlight. Which is surprisingly difficult, given that her new student keeps cluelessly bursting into every room.

(Previously: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/4drak1/ponymote_craziness_66/d1u01u4))

-----------------------------------

*Prompt #19:*

As part of the newest friendship lesson, Twilight brings her pupil along for her next get-together with her Canterlot friends. It turns out however, that Moondancer is not too keen on the idea of Starlight living together with *her* Twilight.

-----------------------------------

*Prompt #20:*

The reason as to why Luna did not show up during Cadance' and Shining Armors wedding was that her and Chrysalis are one and the same.

-----------------------------------

*Prompt #30:*

Cadance finds out that ""the mindcontrol"" Shining Armor was under in the days leading up to their wedding didn't actually exist and was just an easy excuse he and Chrysalis came up with.

Canon: Noone knows.

But as for headcanon...

A giant structure, the actual Hive, produces eggs. They mature over a certain period of time. During that time, if they are not fed/embued with love, they become mindless, genderless drones without the ability to change. If they are fed/embued with love predominantly gathered from one gender they develop into that gender, thus restricting their change ability to that gender. If fed/embued with equal ammounts of love from both genders they become hermaphrodites, giving them the ability to turn into both genders. If fed/ embued with love mostly gathered from one individual they can turn into a hybrid, part changeling, part the being that ""fathered"" them. Queens are hatched from special eggs. The Hive produces a new one, a copy of the previous queen, if the original should die.

Prompts will be reposted every week (with a new one added) for reasons of different approaches and so newcomers also may take a shot at them. Just pick a prompt and go. I suggest starting your story with ""To prompt #X"" (X=number of the prompt) so readers may know which you picked.

-----------------------------------

*Prompt #1:*

It turns out the changeling invasion was just a cover-up for Chrysalis having a crush on Shining Armor.

-----------------------------------

*Prompt #2:*

Luna finds out that Celestia has been keeping her from social events on purpose.

-----------------------------------

*Prompt #3:*

Originally it was supposed to be a prank, but once Cadance tells everypony, it turns out she *actually* **is** pregnant.

-----------------------------------

*Prompt #4:*

Pinkie tries to convince her friends that all that has happend to them is just a TV-show.

-----------------------------------

*Prompt #5:*

Sunset Shimmer comes back to Equestria to visit Twilight, only to find Twilight has already replaced her with her newest redeemed unicorn, Starlight Glimmer.

Celestia has a secret affair, which is not actually as secret as she thinks.

But just before it hits him the creature lets go of his sword and cluches both claws over its chest. The sword continues a bit further and still hits LD, but instead of a devestating slash it is more of a heavy, blunt impact, knocking him to the side. While trying to figure out what caused his miraculous save LD looks at the dragon again and sees how a curved, silver blade bores its way through the breastplate of the skeleton and even impales both claws. The blade gets ripped upwards and easily cuts its way through the metal and the bones. Upon leaving the chest the blade gets tilted slightly and continues its path through the neck of the dragon, cutting off its head.
