2,"polarized technic works by letting just horizontal waves of light trough one eye, and vertical ones, through the other one. the two images are layed on each other and without glasses it looks very blurry.
the shutter glasses use almost the same technology. but instead of dividing the resolution by half (either horizontal or vertically), the image is synced to the glasses and is changing from the one eye to the other sixty times per second. this happens on the tv(or cinema screen) and in the glasses as well.
the shutter technology is active, does have a better resolution, but is more light-absorbing and expensive then the polarized glasses. 

edit: red and blue glasses arent used anymore, because they falsify the colors and create a very fuzzy picture",2015-07-11 23:03:32+00:00,ct04dtv,1,t3_3cye2a,2872,explainlikeimfive
