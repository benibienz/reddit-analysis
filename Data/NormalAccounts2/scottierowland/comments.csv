183,"Name: RJ Supernova
Age: 24

Physical Description: Slicked back brown hair and kempt beard. Slightly undersized, but in very fit wrestling shape.
Persona: Believes himself to be the next icon of the wrestling world, having broken in at a young age. A showoff both in and out of the ring, who always tries to go above and beyond what may be necessary to achieve the ""wow"" factor. Determined to be a champion at all costs. Anyone standing in the way is simply collateral damage.

Attire: Long red trunks, accented in white with the word ""Supernova"" running up the outside. taped wrists with messages written on them differing on the occasion. Frequently enters with long black coat (think Edge).

Style of Wrestler: High impact. No risk is too much. Has technical ability, but would rather just crack some skulls .

Signature Moves: Shining wizard, STO, Lionsault, Side Effect, and anything quasi suicidal

Finishers: Straightjacket backbreaker (lifts opponent on one shoulder into a drop, driving shoulder into opponent's spine), Shooting Star Press

Entrance (pyro, motions, etc): High energy (a la Seth Rollins), runs to the ring and climbs the turnbuckles
Theme Song: Hail Destroyer by Cancer Bats

Catchphrase (If any): TBD

Twitter Handle: RJNOVA
