I Did It: Fitness Center is a new app in Beta today that helps people who want to exercise but can't seem to find the time. Our aim is to take daily events we do and use those as triggers to do one quick workout.
An example would be going to the bathroom. Once you go to the bathroom, go into the app, tap “I went to the bathroom” and the app will give you a random workout such as “Do 20 Pushups”. Do your pushups and tap the check mark. That’s it. You’re done.

RWF is fueled by the creativity of its users. Simply put, you will have fun with this only if you put your own effort into it. Engaging other users on your own to build stories will make this a great world for you to share with others. Titles and victories come with success, but are not a measurement of your value.
RWF features 1 show a week, Battleground, on our ""YouTube"" Channel as well as PPV's.  Here's a timeline of how a show happens:

* The line-up is posted by the RWF moderators
* Posts are created on the main page for wrestlers to post their promos
* A booking committee votes on the winner based on the promos
* The show is written by writers or the wrestlers themselves, depending on preference.  
* A new line-up is posted for a new show
This cycle continues perpetually, but is only effective if you add creative content to it. Each week, add more flavor to your character, even if you don’t have a match using promos or segments. You don't have to have a match to post a promo developing characters and angles.
GETTING STARTED
If you’ve never been part of an e-fed before, you’re in luck. Dozens of years of combined experience are here to help you out. To apply, visit the application page to get started. You’ll receive a reply from our leadership team telling you what to do next. You may have a maximum of two characters at a time, whether they be two wrestlers, a wrestler and a valet, a tag team, etc.
Once you’ve been an active, weekly member of the RWF for 30 days, you’ll be approved to join our Out of Character subreddit. This page is for discussing character development, upcoming lineups, stables, tag teams, and more. This is where the real RWF happens behind the scenes.
Meanwhile, please message the moderators, especially /u/scottierowland, if you have a storyline idea and we as the mods can discuss it together. Some of your ideas might not fly because they are either not in the best interest of the fed, collide with a different storyline, or just don’t fit your character. Don’t get discouraged - keep trying. Regardless, keep dropping promos. If you're impressive, you'll be watched closely, so consider your options, message the mods, and see what happens.
Our team of 3-4 judges will vote on singles matches with majority getting the nod. For tag team matches, promos are rated from 1-4. 1 being the best and 4 being the worst. The team with the lowest combined score wins. Other gimmick matches like battle royales are handled on a case-by-case basis.
PROMOS
The deadline for all match promos is the Sunday before your match by 11:59 PM EST. From there, judges will be asked to rank the promos and the matches will be written. When writing a promo, the judges tend to look for character development, clash with your opponent, surprises, suspense, humor, and more. Just saying you’ll beat your opponent to a bloody pulp probably won’t win much. In addition, never use another person’s character without their permission.
SHOWS
* Lineup is posted two weeks before the show
* Promos are due one week before the show
* Votes from the voting team are due five days before the show posts
* Any segments to add to the show are due three days before the show (Thursday night EST)
* Show is posted on Sunday and a new lineup Sunday/Monday
OTHER POLICIES
* You may handle a maximum of two active wrestlers, whether male or female. Other characters may also be added to your group, such as managers and valets.
* Females compete for the ""Queen of RWF"" moniker, which is less formally defended than other titles.
* Males compete for the tag team, world, and television titles.
* Failure to promo for a month will put a handler on the verge of having their character released without reaching out about the issue.
ON SCREEN RWF EMPLOYEES
These are characters that you can use at your leisure, just keep them realistic.
