Growing up on a farm, I learned to love noise, but also sought silence. To keep me from running away, my parents provided me with a bell and while I didn't fall into the creek at 3 years, I did drown in that same creek 17 years later saving the cows from a flash flood, ending up in hell.

Thus, when I found myself on stage with a cowbell I played better than a fiddler in Georgia. My smooth skill with sounds brought tears to the eyes of the damned. some even say for a second the heat of hell was quenched; an antidote to the fever of enteral damnation.

286,"Ladies and gents, it's finally happening! It took months of hard training and a lot of preparations, and now the TLV Derby Girls are proud to announce a special, open to the public bout!

If you're looking for an awesome, fast sport, or if you're wondering where all the roller skates fans are – well, it's time to get to know the first Israeli roller derby league! Roller derby is an exciting feminist contact sport, played entirely on roller skates, that has spread around the US and Europe over the past decade and came to Israel four years ago. Since then we managed to fall on our asses a few times, and set up a true DIY league.

The historic event will take place on Saturday, January 16, in the gymnasium of Tichon Hadash high school. Address - Namir Road 81, Tel Aviv.

Doors open at 11:15 am.

The game is fast and crazy, and if you want to understand what's happening - you should be on time and not miss the demo of the game rules.
See you there!
***free entrance***

I have delivered the dairy to more countries than you can count, milked the cow from Columbia to Kazakhstan and then I went into the private sector.
