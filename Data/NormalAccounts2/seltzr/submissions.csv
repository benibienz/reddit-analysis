I was looking to join SMRG (Shenandoah Mountain Rescue Group) but left for a temporary contract overseas. Seeing as I do not know where I will return to in the States, I would like to know the best advice to set myself up, get experience, and one day be eligible for a paying job in the field of SAR. Unfortunately the military is not an option. Any guidance would be appreciated such as going back to school (I have a 4 year degree in an unrelated field) or what I should be looking for.

My number one goal is Park Ranger (be it National or State) which is why this interests me, but I also want to give back to my community. I did not get anything out of CERT. Would a state regulated defense force (the legal military command of that state) be a good area or Coast Guard auxiliary? 

Where do I begin is my first question.
