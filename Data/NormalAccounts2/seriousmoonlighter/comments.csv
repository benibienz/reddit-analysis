0,"Our moms are besties and we were born around the same time (and we both had brothers born 3 years later) so we were basically each others default best friend since we all spent so much time together. We grew up to be very different people though with very little in common except for childhood memories. We're in our early 30's now, stayed reasonably close up until a couple of years ago when she got knocked up by her complete asshole of a boyfriend who left her right before the baby was born. Then they got together again briefly, she got pregnant again and he left again. He already had 3 kids with 2 other people so I'm not sure why it was much of a surprise..she always had the worst taste in friends and guys. As someone who doesn't intend to have children I have a hard time relating to her life now and gave up trying to maintain the friendship after visiting her in our hometown and realised there really wasn't anything there anymore. The worst part is our moms, dads and brothers are all still really close and think I'm a jerk for not maintaining the friendship. ",2016-11-17 14:20:09+00:00,da46zhw,1,t3_5devxa,18598,AskReddit
1,"When I was a kid, people would CONSTANTLY tell me how insanely thick my hair was, they'd never seen anyone with thicker hair etc and now it's definitely significantly less thick than it used to be and basically has been since puberty. I googled it at one point and found that it's pretty common to loose thickness after puberty or have a change of texture (my hair was pretty much stick straight as now it's curly though I'm not sure if that's because of my moms aggressive brushing and attempts at management that made it seem straight when I was a kid and now that it's a bit less thick it doesn't weigh the curls down). I have no thyroid/PCOS problems so I think it just happens to some people unfortunately. Not that you shouldn't investigate potential health problems but it might just be the way your hair is now I'm afraid. I'm sorry you have to deal with that!

3,"I get pretty bad anxiety but have gotten really good at managing it, especially over the last 6 months. Here's what I do: 

‚Ä¢Guided meditation (there's loads of free ones on YouTube)-once you get past how cheesy it can be, it' can be super effective at releasing tension and stress. 
‚Ä¢A quick session of easy laid back yoga [this one is my favourite and Adrian is amazing](http://youtu.be/bJJWArRfKa0)
‚Ä¢write out everything that's bothering me in a diary/journal, being careful not to dwell.
‚Ä¢colour in an adult colouring book or draw... even a very small creative output makes me feel more worthwhile and is calming/distracting
‚Ä¢drink a glass of water and eat something with actual nutrients. I know it's nice to indulge when you're feeling down but too much junk can just add to a bad mood and you'll feel good about taking care of yourself. 

But most importantly don't feel guilty for needing a bit of self care or doing whatever it is that works for you. Hope you feel better soon friend!",2016-09-19 14:27:55+00:00,d7t5fky,1,t3_53flia,42041,TrollXChromosomes

71,If I could afford to get my lady bits waxed all the time I totally would!

72,It's probably better to use facial hair lightener since it's meant for more sensitive skin and do a patch test before going for it. The coarseness might make it react differently than facial or head hair but it won't hurt you as long as you're not already sensitive to it.

124,"FYI this is gonna be wordy..as a long term expat this is something I spend a lot of time thinking about...

I've been living away from my family for almost 10 years, the last 6 abroad and while it was never physically abusive, my relationship with my mother especially was strained to say the least.  She constantly criticised my appearance, told me I was a pathetic loser with no friends, would play ""pranks"" on me in front of my family to make me look stupid, redecorate my room while I was away ie go through all my shit and throw away what she didn't like. My grandparents were much much worse to her so I honestly think she didn't see anything wrong with her actions and was trying her best but just has no idea how to be a loving mother. 

Moving to the opposite coast to a city I adored was the best thing I ever did for myself. It made me feel so free and alive. Putting some distance between me and my Mom and figuring out how to do what makes me happy instead of trying to please her and constantly being subject to her scrutiny has been so SO beneficial for me. 

I left a younger brother and a sister behind and it feels super selfish (I still struggle with this tbh) but taking care of yourself and doing what's right for you should be your top priority. Moving away and being able to establish independence and my own sense of self has made me a better happier person,  way better at handling my Mom (we have a pretty good relationship nowadays), and hopefully a role model for my little sister (she's 13). I fucking hate that I can't be there while she grows up but I've shown her how awesome life can be when you take charge and make shit happen for yourself. My family lives in a small farming town where no one really leaves unless they join the military. When I was a kid though, my favourite uncle who was a total black sheep moved half way across the country to study poetry. Even though I only ever saw him at the occasional holiday after that he inspired me beyond words and showed me it was possible to do something different and follow my dreams. That's worth way more in my mind. 

The homesickness will be hard, not gonna lie. I still cry very now and then and feel left out of a lot of family news but it does get easier over time and you figure out how to stay in touch with the people that mean the most to you. The way I deal with it is whenever I'm missing someone, instead of just feeling sad, I write them a letter or even just a short message saying ""Hey, was just thinking about you, miss you!"" Or whatever. Send pictures of or talk to them about the mundane happenings in your everyday life...sharing the little things makes a big difference. 

I don't think I can really help with the controlling mom aspect or breaking the news to your family (I didn't tell my parents I was moving to the other side of the country till about a week before I left..do not recommend this approach) but if you think you will be happier in California then you should go!

137,I love telling people that my open relationship with my husband was my idea (though not my conservative parents admittedly). Everyone always assumes it was him that wanted to open it up and I just went along with it to keep him or some shit but nope!

138,Parlux are the best in my opinion. They're great for a nice shiny blowout but maybe a bit overpowered and expensive if you're using it just to finger dry your hair. ,2016-01-25 05:25:26+00:00,czaxt5z,1,t3_42j891,9538,Hair

141,"I'm in a cohabiting long term relationship and have the same problem. Almost everyone I meet just wants to be casual and it's definitely frustrating and not magically better on the flip side I'm afraid. I sometimes fret or rationalise it away (I must be doing something wrong! People can't see that there's room for them in my life but there is!) but really it comes down to the fact that things just haven't gone in that direction with anyone I've dated recently because they weren't a good enough fit. 

Couple privilege is definitely a thing and I work really hard to keep mine in check but if the people you're seeing only have room for new people in a very specific or predetermined way (ie secondary or strictly casual) than perhaps they're not a good enough fit for you either. 

Its tough though but being with someone who doesn't want to connect with me as deeply as I do with them often make me feel even more lonely. *hugs* I hope you find what you're looking for!

142,thank you for saying this. i've never seen anyone else talk about sometimes feeling such deep doubt about things that are otherwise so absolute like loving your long term partner. i don't have any helpful advice but you're not alone. ,2015-10-25 22:48:23+00:00,cwcplnb,2,t1_cwckunv,7464,books

144,"Yeah, I'm cautious of dating non-poly people as well but even people I've met at poly meetups (like the dude mentioned in this post) or that have poly clearly listed on their OKC profile have turned out not to be up for it after all so I think its more a 'easier said than done' thing for a lot of people. It is frustrating and I know the feeling of trying not to lose hope. Stay positive friend! ",2015-08-19 18:28:18+00:00,cu8jfti,4,t1_cu8hook,2419,TrollPoly
145,"Yeah but after thinking on it for a few days, I actually feel kind of relieved. I don't have to worry about whats gonna happen (he gave loads of super mixed signals for weeks) and now I can just enjoy the bits the do work (friendship and great sex).

146,"I know right! No matter what I say, pretty much everyone assumes that because I already have one established relationship, that I must be looking for sex to 'spice things up' or whatever.  Or maybe the reality is that there are a lot more people happy to have sex with a poly lady than be in a relationship with one :/ ",2015-08-19 17:34:32+00:00,cu8h3qk,2,t1_cu8ftn9,1788,TrollPoly
147,"oh man that is so me today! hope your day got better! 

i've not really had anyone to talk to today so i'm gonna have a little rant here about it if thats cool with you guys?

First there was a group of guys doing drugs in the hall of my building  which conveniently faces my kitchen window. So when they saw me getting my work stuff ready, they all gawped and watched me, making comments about me to each other until I went and sat int the living room in the dark for a bit hoping they'd go away but no such luck. It did however made me miss my bus and the alternate one I took was on diversion around a bunch of construction which made late.. Then when I got to work, it turns out my colleague who gets in 2hrs before me and sets everything up for the day has called in sick and I'll have to stay at least a couple of hours extra to catch us up. Then my manager tells me my 'request' to change my hours due to starting school in a couple of weeks might not be approved even though I've told her for for over a month that they need to hire a replacement and I would only be able to do my current shift temporarily.
