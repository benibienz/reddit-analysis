0,"No I mean as in that's literally in the rulebooks. 'Females' are not allowed to wear visors, whereas 'males' get the choice between visor and cage (this would imply it's to do with sex: see addendum for exception). It's an outdated rule born from a time when women were seen as needing protection, and it hasn't been challenged since, pretty much as very few women in hockey actually mind. In the entire women's team I trained with, only 2 girls would wear a visor if they had a choice, and only one of them actually felt strongly about it rather than ""well it would be nice to have a choice but I don't mind"".

*Howver* I think it should be a choice for everyone. I think there are enough people who would want to wear visors, and enough closeted trans men as well, for this to be challenged. So yeah, go ahead. You should challenge it, if only so that the few girls who would like the choice can have it. 

As an addendum: trans men in rec hockey in the UK are allowed under EIHA rules to wear visors, just like any other men, provided they are living and competing as guys.",2016-08-07 13:06:41+00:00,d67qni8,,t1_d67h4e1,30266,hockeyplayers

She knows, I've told her before. 

She has had a recent reminder that I'm a guy, as well as the fact that I wear a visor on the ice. I'm not on T yet (ugh) but I have been out for well over a year and the coach of the other team we both trained with together used my name all the time and the correct pronouns. She's had long enough, and like I say, *I wear a visor*. Girls don't wear visors. I also pass relatively well, and nobody else has clocked my sex yet.

6,"No-one, for me. Although I have the situation whereby I *have* to be out to some people, as they knew me before I came out as trans (i.e. before I started living as a guy). I trained with a women's team (mixed training) and juniors before I came out so they all know, and a couple of players from those teams train with the rec teams I've just joined but I did ask them not to say anything to the others. In short, I'm out to people who knew me 'before', but to new people, I'm not. Except now, through this, I might be forced to be, which is my issue.

I'm not currently on treatment (although I mentioned above to someone that this might give more weight to my appointment tomorrow about hormones, it's been a couple of years of waiting now and I can't deal with it anymore, and people are more likely to respect your gender if it matches up with what they can see) and I'm the shortest on the team but I am aware that women's hockey is non-checking and I'm coming from a background of juniors which is very physical, and naturally am more aggressive. When I grind for the puck I can get a bit rough and that's probably why I didn't realise how hard I'd gone into the boards.

However, as I was coming up to the boards, she was upright, and it was only as I was going right up in for the puck that she bent down. I would never have gone in for her if she had been bent down as I was going in.",2016-08-03 17:15:19+00:00,d62pi9d,2.0,t1_d62l745,5377,hockeyplayers

9,"I didn't have a problem with her, she was a nice girl and I had chalked that down to being an accident, and the comments in her message to me a few weeks ago I put down to just lack of education which isn't really a big deal because it wasn't blatant transphobia and as I say, she was a nice girl.

I didn't go in with the intent to ram her from behind, as you're making out. Maybe I'm not describing the situation well but assuming you're a player you should know when the puck is by the boards and a few people are going for it (me, this girl, and another guy), there will be a scuffle. That is what happened. I described the position the girl was in to explain that it wasn't a hit *up* the boards, but more directly into the boards. And it was *still* and accident, because it occurred during the scuffle. She wasn't bent over when I was skating up to the boards, so it's hardly as if I saw her position beforehand. I'm not a monster, people.

As someone with cluster headaches from repeat traumatic head injuries I'm not about to leave someone else with that hell intentionally.

I am sorry for what I did. Genuinely. It was an accident and I feel bd she got hurt and I'm glad she is recovering well.

10,"Fair enough. I don't mean to minimise it, I was just pointing out that it wasn't a strong hit, or even a hit, and that the concussion was classed as a minor one. Yes the *injury* may be viewed as a serious one like you say due to the fact it is the brain involved, and repeat concussions as we all know can lead to CTE or other Tauopathies but the actual concussion itself was not.

I don't know how she could possibly feel that. I know I come off as crass on this thread, trust me I do, but the messages between her and I are anything but. I've apologised multiple times, and each time she has said ""it's hockey"" or ""these things happen haha"". 

""You keep talking about how you feel and what you did, but most of those actions were unseen by her. From her point of view, you get no credit for those actions.""

11,"Sure I take responsibility, in that it was my play, and my fault she got hurt. It was an accident, though. 

I'm not sure how fast I was going, maybe I went harder than I realised; that's entirely possible. Like I said above, I thought it was just a bit of a knock initially and went ""oh, sorry"" like you might if you ran into someone in the street or something. It was only a bit later I realised she was actually hurt. So yeah I probably knocked her harder than I thought. Bear in mind though that she was bent almost double, and perpendicular to the boards, and I came pretty much directly behind her. So I wouldn't have had to have been going *nearly* as hard to hurt her, than I would had I come in at an angle, or had it been a regular boarding.

My point stands, though, that it wasn't a hit, because a hit implies intent; this was an accident, and didn't warrant getting outed and having my safety compromised on a team I've just joined. I'm sorry for what I did, and I didn't have any reason to do it, but I didn't *intend* to either, it just happened when I went for the puck and it could have equally been me on the receiving end, as it has been many times before.",2016-08-03 12:15:16+00:00,d62d180,2.0,t1_d629uvu,9262,hockeyplayers
12,"Oh, ok, I did wonder. 

I actually said sorry when her head hit the board, but it was more of an ""oh, sorry"" thing because I didn't realise what I'd done at the time. Then after the puck was out, I went after it then turned to ask if she was ok but she must have changed out by that point because I couldn't see her. She was on the other bench, so I couldn't apologise to her when I got off either. I waited for her outside once I was changed but she must have left by that point. So it's not like I didn't try.

Will do haha

We aren't allowed to put them on the boards on the rec sessions I train on, although at juniors we do. My inhaler lives on the boards during practice and nobody has moved it since the first session when I nearly ended up back in hospital because someone put it behind the boards and I couldn't find it. But bottles are a no.

I've definitely got to be more vocal though. I'm struggling with that right now.

14,"She trained with me before I came out, so she already knew by default. I don't tell anyone IRL who doesn't have to know.

It wasn't really a serious concussion tbh, it was a minor concussion, and was diagnosed as such. It wasn't a strong hit at all. It wasn't even a hit. I've glided into the boards with more gusto.

Of course it doesn't justify anything, I mentioned it because it was relevant to the point that it must have been her who said I was 'a girl' to her friend, and therefore isn't really a safe person to be around. I'm not remotely comfortable with the thought of sharing a locker room in which she might discuss this with other people, when she has discussed me in this manner.

""(where I'll make an assumption you have a size advantage)""

&amp;nbsp;

""are unapologetic about it.[...]I'm not seeing at any point that you apologized to the other player.""

You're not seeing that, because as I said previously, my multiple sincere and genuine apologies to her were private, exchanged in messages between her and I over the weekend and Monday.

&amp;nbsp;

""All of us as players hide injuries to show strength and not appear weak.""

I know. Every time I step on the ice, my pain score is between an 8-10, on *my* pain scale, which is something quite different to most people's. Granted, that's not a *current* injury, but it's a similar deal. You don't need to tell me that, and I don't see your point. Her concussion was literally classed as clinically minor. That's nothing to do with her being stoical; that's medical.

&amp;nbsp;

On the slurs thing, it's *really* not slurs I'm worried about as a consequence of being outed. That would be the very, very least of my worries.

&amp;nbsp;

""The irony here of course is you're concerned for your safety as a grand-individual while you took advantage of someone else's""

A 'grand-individual'? Not sure what you mean. But that aside, I didn't take advantage of her safety. That's bull. Utter bull. I went for the puck, like anyone else would.

But she's recovering fine, and the flack people are giving is a little unwarranted. And really, my own safety is now a serious concern to me.

The point is that I wanted to be entirely closed about this to the team. I didn't want any of them to know. Now, I might not have a choice at all. If other people have seen the post, if it comes out, sure my teammates *should* be respectful of who I am because it's hard-wired in my brain and I can't change that.

""The DSM-IV-TR has two major diagnostic criteria for Gender Identity Disorder in children, adolescents, and adults:

A. Persistent and strong cross-gender identification.
B. ""Persistent discomfort with his or her sex or sense of in appropriateness in the gender role of that sex.""""

As I saw on another site, ""Not everyone can identify as everything. An able bodied person cannot identify as disabled. Someone without mental illness cannot identify as mentally ill. Someone without the one and only symptom of being trans- gender dysphoria- cannot identify as trans. Some labels are closed labels for certain groups, and that is okay. "" I feel completely male. But although an agender person could have no dysphoria and yet still call themselves 'trans', I could not call myself 'agender' when I feel fully male.

And from the Tumblr blogger bofa-gender:
""A simple why you’re not trans if you don’t have dysphoria.
1.  Gender = How your brain maps your body in regards to sex. 

2. Trans = On the opposite side of; Cis = On the same side of. 

3. Transgender = Gender is on the opposite side of sex. This causes a disconnect between the gender and the sex, which causes dysphoria. 

4. Cisgender = On the same side of the sex. This means there is harmony between the gender and the sex, and the person does not have dysphoria. 

That’s why you can’t have our words, because they don’t apply to you. That’s why we have nothing in common, and there’s nothing gained from grouping us together. Feel free to create your own terms and community, but we had transgender first so it should be ours to keep.""

Also, the other thing that p--ses me off is the fact that my non-dysphoric NB friend can take -- and has taken -- that trans label right off when things get bad. But I'm stuck with it. It's f-*king soldered onto my skin and I can't just be trans when I like the sound of it.

As someone else says, and what you seem to have ignored, how can one know that one is transgender without dysphoria? Seriously?

A comment on a forum; ""You need to have some form of dysphoria in order to be trans. It's like saying you can have depression despite never feeling depressed or sad or you can be a vegan if you still eat meat. It doesn't make sense.""

When the dysphoria comes, it might be really mild or just associated with one aspect of their body or typically female characteristics.

So someone might have 24/7 severe dysphoria about all feminine parts of them, while someone else may only get their dysphoria from time to time and when it comes it is just mild chest dysphoria.

2. I have stretch marks and fat and I'm really short. My hands are too small, my feet are too small.

Number one is dysphoria. Number two is hating my body.

Fine, if you're NB _and_ trans, fine. But being NB doesn't make you trans in the same way that being trans doesn't make you NB, and I will not let a NB person use the term 'transgender' or 'trans' about themselves unless they experience dysphoria and are genuinely transgender.

I am what you refer to as a 'Euro' but tinted visors are really not that common.
