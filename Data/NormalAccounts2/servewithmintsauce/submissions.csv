&amp;nbsp;

If you're not cool with LGBT+ stuff, might as well leave now, there's no point commenting if you're going to be unsavoury.

&amp;nbsp;

I haven't mentioned on here before because it wasn't relevant and I'm not open about this, but I'm a trans guy and am currently pre-treatment (although hopefully not for long). On the rec team I joined a few weeks ago, there are 3 players who knew me to any measurable extent before I came out. I asked that they not mention this to anyone at the new team as I intended to stay 'stealth' (as in, other people not knowing I'm trans). They all said ok, although one girl said a bit about it being my choice and stuff, and me ""wanting to be"" a boy, which really isn't how it works. I also heard her refer to me as 'her' to one guy, although I wondered if maybe I'd misheard, and hoped he would think *he* had misheard, given that I wear a visor and stuff.

&amp;nbsp;

At training with this team, we were scrimmaging and the puck went by the boards. This girl went in for it, along with another guy, and I saw a good opportunity to grind the puck out, so I went in for it and of course there was always going to be a scuffle for it, there always is in those situations, and I anticipated that and used it to my advantage but the girl had her head right down and she went head-first into the boards. I knocked the puck away from us, and she skated off for a change. Apparently she was a bit 'dazed' according to the person she changed with, but everyone else said she seemed OK.

&amp;nbsp;

Next day, she went to hospital to get checked out, got a scan, concussion and bit of swelling and told not to play until headache is gone. Pretty standard. She's had quite a few posts on her timeline which have come up on my news feed on Facebook, and a couple have said things like ""the person deserves to get a slap around the head"" or something like that but one in particular was a long, angry post from a friend or someone, in which she clearly said I was a 'girl', multiple times, in the post and in the comments thread. The friend also refers to it as a 'head check' which it was a long way off being.

&amp;nbsp;

The comments thread has many people making angry comments. But one person who commented is someone who has been to every session I have been to with that team so far, so he'll have seen me with my visor and everything..and that post and all the comments referring to me as a girl. It must have been the girl who got injured who said I was a girl, as well, which makes it worse for me.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm not really sure what to do tbh, it was an accident, an *accident*, and I've been outed for it? Sure it was only one team member who commented, but still, he saw it, and others may have seen that, the simple fact that *she* must have said I was a 'girl'..and on my first session with that team I heard one guy use 'tr**ny' as part of a joke.

Previously trained with a juniors U20s/U18s mixed session, and on the mixed-gender training session of our local women's team, but have been on hiatus for a few months due to cluster headaches and asthma.

&amp;nbsp;

So I'm just coming back, laced up 3 weeks ago, and now have started training with two local rec teams, both which consist for the most part of average-to-tall guys. Of course all of them have senior sticks, can reach the shelves in the changing rooms or the bottles behind the boards on the ice, and can jump the boards during scrimmages. I have to use the gate, which most of the time I can do smoothly (although the boards come up to a couple of inches below my shoulders so it's still a bit awkward) but I feel like I'm wasting other people's time or delaying changes. Not to mention it's embarrassing, especially when you're changing more than one player at a time and everyone else jumps and I'm just dealing with the gate. It feels like people think I'm a crap player because of it. I'm not the best player, but I'm not a beginner either yet it's little things like that.

&amp;nbsp;

With the bottles thing, it sounds like a total non-issue but because I can't see my bottle over the boards, in the few moments we have to grab a drink between running through a drill on the board and actually doing it, I usually end up just having to pass because I can't find my bottle in time.

&amp;nbsp;

The actual coaching side of things can be problematic as well. I'm sure you can guess why but in short (haha..ha) I often end up behind people and missing things because the coach is talking through a drill and I'm trying to find a spot where I can see. Occasionally people notice this and help out, but usually people are just focussing on the drill, not on the people around them. Understandably so. 

&amp;nbsp;

I have severe difficulty interacting with people who fit certain criteria and it sounds really stupid but it's just a past issue I'm working on and getting help for, but it does mean that I find it physically impossible at present while I don't know these guys to simply say ""I'm sorry, I can't see"", for instance.

&amp;nbsp;

I don't know. This just really knocks my confidence and makes me even more nervous than I already am around the new guys. People tell me to look at players like Gerbe and St. Louis but I already do, and it doesn't help because much as I love them, they're still 5'4""/5'5"", and they're exceptional players. I'm 4'10"", and not an exceptional player. It's different.

I'm 18 and pre-T/pre-SRS, and I get really crushing dysphoria but I am also very sexual, if that makes sense.

I don't have an actual sex life, but I literally consider going to a gay club just so I can get some. I had a peecock with the pleasure rod -- amazing by the way, I felt like a cis male for the first time ever and could actually jerk off without retching from dysphoria -- but my peecock ripped.

Basically my current setup is the Freetom Uncut 4.5"" STP with a cut-down version of my peecock pleasure rod which sort of works. I could even pack 'hard' with this -- ie have a semi-hard on in my jeans -- if I went to a club or something, so if anything got moving I would have something to work with. 

But I can't pack like that all the time so mostly I'm just having to ride with sensations I can't control which set off my lower dysphoria and make me feel sick.

Has anyone tried using the Freetom STPs with, say, a Peecock pleasure rod?

My Peecock ripped where the shaft joins the balls and although they have offered a 50% discount on my next order, I am just worried by how many people have had theirs rip so I was considering something else. I'm looking at the Freetom Uncut 4.5"" STP and have taken quite a liking to it, but it says they are made of a softer silicone than their 4-in-1s and I'm concerned that I'll rip it easily if I use the pleasure rod I got with my Freetom in it, and that will be another £200 or whatever down the drain. 

So that is the first question.

Secondly, along the same lines, how have people found the durability of the Freetom STPs compared with that of the Peecocks?

The thing is, I'm looking to get the new Bauer 1S stick but I can either get the junior size but spend all my money and have to cut it down, or I can get the youth size for a fraction of the cost, and keep my flex really low, but I could do with an extra inch or two on it. I really want to go with the youth (I'm 4'10"") but I can't find any extensions for a youth stick.

Would a normal extension for a junior stick fit? Would I be better off getting junior? Are there any youth extensions? Could I even get a jr extension and sand it down to fit?

I just ordered the Peecock Gen3S with the original pleasure kit, but Peecock says on their site that their 2-in-1 rod is the only ftm self-pleasure thing, allowing you to 'jack off' like a cis man. Thing is, I honestly cannot see a difference aside from one being two-piece while the other is one-piece.

Can anyone weigh in on whether there is a difference between the two, and how possible it is to self-pleasure with the erection rod + pleasure kit combo?

I feel this invisibility has been furthered by the modern use of the word 'trans' as an umbrella term for all NB and gender-nonconforming people.


Seriously, though:
agender people have a term; bigender people have a term; demigender and genderfluid and pangender and even 'graygender' have terms already, and if after all that someone still feels like they don't have a term which fits them entirely, then they are non-binary and bingo, there's a term.


But transgender people only used to have one term all to themselves, which has now been appropriated by NB people. As if we weren't invisible and oppressed enough already!


Please tell me I'm not the only one who seethes when they hear someone use 'trans' as a catch-all, or refer to themselves as 'trans' when they are really only NB, or put that little asterisk after it like 'trans*'?

I have a junior shaft, mid-kick, 52 flex. PM9 blade, would have had a flat one but they don't seem to be around anymore. I tape minimally, with around 4"" black at the butt end, 10mmx1mm knob, 1"" black about 4/5 of the way down the shaft (where I put my hand for slapshots), and 1.5"" black near the toe of the blade.

For me, coloured laces are fine but I'd be cautious about using neon laces unless you're 5. I personally have black laces with 'si monumentum requiris, circumspice' embroidered on them, so I probably am not in the best place to chirp someone's laces.


Tinted visors. When I get to visor age I will be getting one for medical reasons. IMO, slightly tinted = fine, mirrored = never ever do that again. Also, I prefer it when people aren't cocky about it, and when they either have a decent reason ('I have problems with glare', 'sensitive eyes') or even just simply that they like them. Just don't get cocky. Then I'll chirp your visor right off you.


Finally, holders. I know a lot of people who are fine with black but totally against all coloured and customised holders that aren't black. My personal stance is that you can have customised holders, so long as you don't have [demonic sheep](http://l2.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/pwW2aT4AVXHqDeDWeSIL4Q--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7cT04NTt3PTYwMA--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/Yahoo/ept_sports_oly_experts-39437357-1266442851.jpg)) on them*. I personally love the black holders and the LE Bauer 160s. I would have bought them myself but they don't sell those in the UK.

However, in context; I'm getting a new pair of skates, and I'm intending to get the Bauer Supreme 190s (would've got MX3 but they only start at a JR 3 and I'm a JR 2.5). I might even upgrade the steel from LS2 to LS3 (sadly not to Fusion, again it's just the darned sizes).


Problem is, I'm not a great hockey player or anything. I'm mediocre and although that is in part due to three factors (asthma problems only recently resolved, an operation and tumour which knocked me down for 3 months, and a large difference in sight between my two eyes which I should have been wearing my glasses for) I'm still not likely to ever make it to the Pro league unlike some of the other guys (and girls) I train with in U18s. I'm also a fantastically cr*p 4'10"" (just pushing 5 feet on skates) which means I have to work harder and would never make it into a Power Forward-type role. My only assets in hockey are my ambidexterity (I can play left and right equally as well-- er, badly) and my speed (top speed out of kit is 44.6 kph, and not very far off that if I skate my metaphorical balls off in kit).


However, I have been skating literally (I mean literally) before I could walk. Nothing fancy at the age of 8 3/4 months, but I wasn't staggering across the ice like every other toddler down at the rink. I had the proper leg motions, and although I had to glide around corners, and had to have some support from someone, I was literally skating before I could walk.


Issue is, I'm getting the highest level of Bauer skates I could possibly get with my shoe size, but the guys at hockey don't know about my skating background.
