You can focus on getting one thing done but your other aspects of fitness will suffer. I think that doing just random WODs while focusing on intensity and weaknesses will give you better results in overall fitness.

From what I found after few years going through many CrossFit websites it looks like there are 2 camps of athletes.

A) Athletes who just train doing high volume and high intensity workouts all year long. They will just add some extra volume before open/regionals and/or games. From what I found it looks like in this group are athletes like J. Khalipa, R. Froning, M. Oldroyd and others.

B) Athletes who follow year long plan with peak during Open, Regionals and/or Games. From what I found it looks like in this group are athletes like M. Fraser, J. Foucher, M. Chan and others.

In my opinion doing random high intensity workouts while focusing on weaknesses all year long without periodization is better idea for most of people who are just looking to get as fit as possible. I have personally tried to follow strength routines, be smarter in programming and peak at certain point of year but I have always returned to just random high intensity workouts focused on weaknesses and it gave me better results.

You can focus on getting one thing done like get 405lbs squat, 15 unbroken MUs, 25m handstand walk, 5K run under 20:00 but all other aspects of your fitness will stagnate. And it's really done to make the training plan that will improve you in anything and that will let you peak in the right time.

And as I said before that ""random"" aspect works even for the best athletes and some of them just workout instead of following routines. Here is short intro text from NorCal crew blog.

&gt;What in the world is it?  The NC Lab is a few things….first and foremost it’s real.

&gt;Every day at NorCal CrossFit in San Jose, CA at roughly 1:30pm a group of some of the fittest human beings on the planet get together to train.  They are training for CrossFit competition, specifically the CrossFit Games.  They are also training because they don’t know how to do anything else…they do this for fun.

&gt;What’s unique about this rowdy group of individuals throwing down every afternoon is that until they all get together, they have no idea what they are going to do.  The workouts are made up on the spot and will sometimes even change in the middle of the workout. It seems contradictory, but it also seems to be working.

&gt; “The Lab is a place where you get a bunch of people together and experiment with different things to see what kind of stimulus you can get.  Sometimes it’s good, sometimes it’s not as good.  Take the good stuff and run with it, take the bad stuff…throw it out, but always try and progress.” – Jason Khalipa

&gt;Jason and the other “scientists” in the lab are asked constantly how they train, what kind of programming they follow.  Here on the site you will find just that.  But, if you ask any one of these athletes if it’s the programming that has made them so successful, the answer will be “not really”.
“Too many athletes think that there is one program out there which is simply the best and they just need to follow that one, magical program and they will crush Regionals and go to the CrossFit Games. That is a lie.  Pardon my language but let’s be honest,  every mother f****r in the community is doing squat cleans. Every mother f****r is on the airdyne…..the list goes on. So if everyone is doing generally the same shit, then what is the separating factor? The damn INTENSITY.  If you follow this program religiously but do not attack the workouts with a terrifying level of intensity you will NOT achieve the level of performance which is intended.  We can provide you with the programming, but the intensity is up to YOU.” -Pat Sherwood

&gt;So, this site is dedicated to helping you achieve that intensity through giving you a window in to see how these athletes train and giving you a real picture of what it takes to get to that level.  We are building an online community for those who wish they could make it to the gym at 1:30 pm with these animals, but live around the world.  We will post not just workouts, but videos written tips to help you “get it” and re-create the vibe we have at the NC Lab wherever you might be.",2016-11-19 15:52:21+00:00,da70z3b,1.0,t3_5dsdhh,9609.0,crossfit

For the workout as others said double reps and do only 3-4 rounds will be more effective but even your RX version would be fine if you would do every set unbroken (probably except squat snatches) and do quick transitions (make sure to position all equipment near to each other). And you can always push harder on the run. For example The Chief WOD 5x 3min AMRAP of 3 Power Cleans 135lbs, 6 Push Ups and 9 Air Squats with 1 min rest after each AMRAP have a lot of transitions and you have to be pretty quick in transitions in order to get good score.",2016-11-10 12:29:55+00:00,d9u87l5,2.0,t1_d9tw85r,29709.0,crossfit

I hope I will be able to get calculation of almost all good times in the 70-90th percentil category but it still needs a lot updates.

I have created the app mainly for inspiration for setting good time to beat if you are training alone and setting good time cap if you are making WOD for group of people.

I personally know all people who visit my class, so I tried to make every movement challenging enough so it is very hard to do them unbroken and if someone needed I let them scale or skip the movement.

I must say it was really funny WOD and everyone who was on class really liked it. Only bad thing was that it took about 90 minutes so few people had to leave earlier. I am also not used of doing so many reps in one set and my body was really sore from that for next 3 days.

Thanks to daily vlogs I've found out few things about my self:

* I train harder - maybe it's because I know that someone is watching

* Where are my rest days? - I was working out 3-5 days a week, now I workout 5-6 days a week

* I've been doing muscle ups and pull ups wrong all time - I didn't know about that because I've never recorded them before (except Open)

* As introvert I was always ""scared"" to talk to camera but I was wrong, I actually enjoy it

* My English sucks but it's much better than it was at day 1, I am glad that I see some improvements

Sunday - I have group lesson where I also workout - strength or skill + 1 10-20 Min Metcon

Monday - I have group lesson where I also workout - strength or skill + 1 10-20 Min Metcon

Tuesday - Recovery or interval running and if I don't want to run I will hit some 5-15 Min bodyweight WOD at home

Wednesday - I am visiting public group lesson - never know what WOD is but I like to be challanged by unknown

Thursday - Working out on my own, usually movements that require a lot of skill or a lot of rest between sets + any random MetCon

Friday - We have team WODs, they are much easier for me than classic CrossFit because there is rest involved (I go for 30 seconds, other person goes for 30 secs while I rest)

&gt; Loved recording myself. Trying to do Vlogs. Speaking using English sucks + I am nervous, be nice :), it will get better. 6 months since 95kg snatch PR and still no luck on 100kg. The Chief, wanted +30 rounds, it was hard but I did it. More videos daily.

Hi, I always liked to record myself while working out so I have tried to make few daily Vlogs (3rd video will be up tomorrow) and I really like it. So I decided to make these videos every day for next 6 weeks (I have competition in 6 weeks) and see how it goes. It makes me to push little harder in WODs and I will hopefully improve my English speaking skill.

Please be nice about my English speaking skills, I know I suck at it but it is almost 2 years since I spoke to someone using English + I am super nervous in front of camera. But I believe it will get much better over time :-).

Back to the Vlog video, I've tried to hit 100kg/220lbs on snatch, I am not working towards it but it's almost over half year since I hit 95kg/209lbs snatch PR and I get nervous every time when I decide to approach 100kg/220lbs, I am not sure why but maybe because it's so huge milestone for me (my bodyweight is 75kg/165lbs). Oh and it was first time I was under that 100kg snatch, all previous attempts in last 6 months were just high pulls.

Second workout is The Chief, I was aiming for 30 or more rounds and I did it but I must say my legs were burning and hearth rate was pretty high. It was hard but quick pace was maintainable thanks to that 1 min rests between AMRAPs.

The Chief

Max rounds in 3 minutes of:

135 pound Power cleans, 3 reps

6 Push-ups

9 Squats

104,"**How do you guys program?**

I personally follow few rules when doing my own programming.

1) 80% of the time work on my weaknesses and movements I don't like

2) 80% of the WODs are from 5 min to 20 min, going long from time to time

3) I listen to my body and I am making WODs from movements that I could do with high intensity (For example I won't do heavy squats 3 days in row, I would rather mix squats, pulls and presses into these 3 days)

4) When my body is really fatigued I will just take 1-2 days off

**I understand that there is a WOD, but what else do you do?**

* Sometimes I am doing only WOD, sometimes I do strength work (e.g. Deadlift 5x5) and WOD, sometimes 10-20 Min EMOM and WOD, sometimes I mix my strength work and WOD into one long workout, etc. -&gt; routine is the enemy

**How many days of the week do you workout?**

* From 3 to 7 days a week, it depends on my free time. If I know I will be in the gym only 3 days a week I would push little harder or do extra WOD each day.

**Do you do the WOD and then some? Do you do the WOD after a lifting session?**

* Usually strength before WOD but I am huge fan of combining strength into WODs (like snatch/clean ladder regionals2016/games2016) or doing AMRAP and then setting only few minutes to find max lift

* I also love putting strength work into EMOMs for example

1. Min: 5 burpee, 7 box jump, 9 wall ball

2. Min: 3 deadlifts (increasing weight each round)",2016-07-27 20:32:50+00:00,d5th3r8,1.0,t3_4uvvn5,10174.0,crossfit

* Buy meat at local butcher, they are almost everywhere. Meat is almost for 1/2 price there compared to grocery stores and you know it's fresh. Just try to avoid buying meat on Mondays, butchers usually prepare meat on Monday for whole week.

* Buy everything else in grocery store (vegetables, fruit, cheese, ham, etc.).

Lidl (cheap, fresh, high quality) - one of the few grocery stores that have great meat/fish.

Billa/Globus (expensive but high quality) - never had problem with them but they are little expensive

Kaufland (cheap but may lack quality in meat section, diary/ham is expensive there) - one of the best shops for vegetables and fruit

Tesco/Albert (bad reputation, only cheap items are the ones in discount, meat and vegetables are not usually fresh) - I have thrown away some meat and vegetables that I bough there

Small grocery stores - usually Asian guy is selling there, pretty expensive

Local markets - if you find good one it is the best source of cheap and fresh vegetables/fruit

192,"Strength is just one of 10 functions of fitness you need to work on. 

I know what's your problem with CrossFit and I have also been there. I didn't understood why CrossFit is random, why there is no cycling, why there is no routine, how can it work if there is no system, etc. 

For first half of a year I was doing my bodybuilding routine and at the end I have finished it with WOD (Workout of the day) as a finisher but soon I realized that 1 WOD is just enough and it doesn't matter if it is 20 Min AMRAP or Deadlift 7x1.

CrossFit is not just about improving strength (even though we see so huge requirements in regional/games workouts), CrossFit is about improving in everything and strength is just one of this things.
Main reason why CrossFit works is constant variance, high intesity and functional movement. Plus I would add work on your weakness whatever it is, it may be slow 100m sprint, weak snatch, bad handstand walk, weak squat, etc. It can be everything.

When you realize what is CrossFit about you will forget about doing strength routine everyday and find yourself being Jack of all trades.

On other hand if you want to do CrossFit style workouts focused on strength they would work but in my opinion doing some old classics like sheiko, fomin and other routines would be much more effective if you want to get really strong.",2016-05-11 14:36:34+00:00,d31brzj,2.0,t1_d30v7z8,40752.0,crossfit

Pain was coming back everytime when I tried to squat heavy and run in the same week.

At first I want to tell you that you should definitely visit doctor before taking any advice from internet but here is what I have done with my knee pain and it's gone after few years.

1) I have stopped doing every movement that hurts for at least 3 months - rowing instead of running, doing easy squats instead of heavy squats, focused more on technique instead of lifting heavy weights

2) I was slowly reintroducing myself back to these movement - doing them only once or twice per week, started with lower weights and I have been adding more weights each week

3) I have never used knee sleeves  and any other accessory so I can lift heavy weights while my knee was still injured - using knee sleeves, wrist wraps, belts and other accessories is worst thing you can use if you still feel pain, they are here for you to avoid injuries when trying heavy weights not for minimizing the pain when you are injured

16.4 - I don't liked that chipper too much, I would make it more movements but lesser reps or remove the wall balls so more people would have chance to hit 2nd round

16.5 = 14.5 - I know there were burpees twice but 16.1 had only few burpees in each round and workout was about all the movement so if you sucked at burpees you could still hit good score but if you sucked at burpees in 16.5 then you were screwed

245,"I have started crossfit after 5 years of bodybuilding and crossfit was so confusing for me, I would give you few tips that may save you a lot of time:

1) CrossFit workouts are random and there is no routine.

   - Random? It's worth to check your workout log from time to time and check if you are working on your weakness (it may be anything from weak legs, bad mobility, core strength up to only doing +20 minute workouts, not doing any running etc.)

2) CrossFit.com workouts are not ""the only thing"" that you do on that day

  - Workout like Fran (21-15-9 Thrusters + Pull Ups) isn't really 2-10 minutes and let's go home. If there is such workout on the crossfit.com you should 1) work on mobility/warm up, 2) work on your weaknesses, 3) Fran specific warm up (some easy thrusters, pull ups, technique, etc.) 4) Go home or work again on your weaknesses like gymnastic/core/technique etc.

3) You can follow *ANY* programming but be honest with yourself and scale

  - Many crossfit gyms have their own programming daily updated on the web

  - I would recommend following NorCal start with Fitness category http://nc.fit/wod/ , workouts are compex and ""make sense"" it is not just random in long term

  - Crossfit.com programming is also very great but many times there are too hard workouts so you may find yourself scaling too many workouts on the other side there are plenty of comments to each workout and you can take inspiration for scaled workouts

  - **SCALE WORKOUTS!** You did workout wrong if 50 average people will finish workout in 10 minutes but it will take you 30 minutes because e.g. you are weak on pull ups (you could do jumping pull ups etc.)

4) Workout of the day is the main thing and you should hit it as hard as possible

  - Intensity &gt; volume of training. Crossfit workouts should be intense (do as many reps as possible or do them as quickly as possible), intesity is the reason why CrossFit really works!

5) Don't be affraid of barbell workouts or highly technical workouts

  - Sure, 135 lbs overhead squats may be hard for beginner but there is no reason why you shouldn't do them with just PVC pipe or empty barbell. PVC may be easy but 135 lbs overhead squats are also easy for top athletes.

If you have any more questions just feel free to ask.",2016-03-19 15:46:57+00:00,d15qm6g,1.0,t3_4azs2z,73816.0,crossfit

Before training sessions just quick warm up - hanging on the bar, doing some handstands, narrow grip overhead squats with barbell etc.

* or some crazy EMOMs (1 round cindy, row 20 cal, 15 burpees, sometimes mixed with heavy barbell on even minute)

* Any metcon workout, I am trying to do everything what has been posted on crossfit.com (it's about 60% of my workouts), another 20% is inspiration from BTWB where I choose workouts that counts towards my fitness level and last 20% of workouts are WODs which I make for myself when I want to try something or my body needs just rest so I will use my favorite movements

**3rd part**

* I am doing 3rd workout only about 50% off time, usually it is ~10 minute metcon where I am trying to go for high skill movements (handstand walk, muscle ups,...) or I am trying to hit the core (e.g. 5 rounds of 20 KB swings + 10 T2B)

But if you don't have time or you just want to avoid mistakes than buy a plan. I would suggest you to keep an eye on what you will get for your money. I am not big fan of premade plans because each body is different and it is nearly impossible to make plan for somebody. You can take like 20 guys 175 cm / 75 kg and all off them would need different plan because there are many points at which you need to look when making plan.
