before I moved to city 2 years ago I lived near mountains and I was doing CrossFit 3-4 times a week and running the hills 2-3 times a weeks. Back then I was used to run at least 20 km in mountains per week.

Fast forward 2 years, I live in the city and if I would like to train on mountains I would have to drive for at least 1 hour. Anyway I decided to sign up for local trail run which is 64 km with over 3000 m elevation and try to finish it even though I would do only CrossFit as my preparation. I was able to fit in only 2 short trail runs before the race.

During race day I knew that I won't be able to attack top positions but my goal was to finish the race under 10 hours.

For first 20 km I held pretty great pace, I was able to run all the time except parts where I was going to uphill. 

But after that my knee started to hurt, I knew it's my old injury so I had to slow down when running downhill.

At 40 km blisters appeared on my left feet, it hurts but my knee was much bigger problem at that time. Pushing pace downhill became almost impossible. All guys who I passed on the way up passed me on the way down but somehow I was still able to catch them in next uphill.

At 58 km, just 6 km before finish line, I've finished my last uphill with time 9h20min and I knew I would be able to run this 6K down from the hill in under 40 minutes.

I ran for only about 50m downhill and my knee said STOP, all I felt was stabbing pain in the knee with every move I made and I was unable to move. So I stopped down for the while, took some painkillers, drank some alcohol and used provisional bandage that I made from my t-shirt.

It hurt like hell but at least I was able to keep slowly walking to finish line. At the end it took me 1h45min to finish that last 6 km.

Fast forward to the day after the race, my knee hurts and it seems be OK in 2-3 days but I have counted total of 11 blisters on my left foot and only 1 on right foot, so I took care about all of them. My left foot is swollen and is burning compared to my right foot, I even have slight fever. Maybe some of them are infected.

Today it is 3 days after the race, knee is almost OK but left foot is still slightly swollen.

I am glad that I didn't gave up and I think that in matter of conditioning CrossFit prepared me well for this race but next time I know that I can't avoid practicing long runs before such race because my feet need to get used to such load and I think if I would have run at least 100-200 km in 2-3 month window before the race that I wouldn't suffer so much on blisters.

Vid from the race: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ow5Be0Hz90

**tl;dr** I always loved trail races but don't do them for almost 2 years, anyway I decided to give a shot to one that is 64 km long with 3000 m elevation. In half of the race my old injured knee hurts, blisters started to appear. 6 km before end my knee gave up, stabbing pain in it. I walked last 6 km in 1h45min. Day after the race knee hurts but my blisters are probably infected, left foot is swollen and burning, all that continue for few more days. I thought CrossFit would be enough as preparation but it wasn't.",crossfit,"TIFU by running 64 km (40 Miles) Trail Race without special preperation, I thought CrossFit would be enough",https://www.reddit.com/r/crossfit/comments/4y09p9/tifu_by_running_64_km_40_miles_trail_race_without/

Short about me is at the end of the post.

I have tried everything from 0g of carbs/day for almost year to about 400g of carbs/day. I will try to sort out what worked best/worst for me.

&gt; tl;dr

* This is me: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbXS2inl3z8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbXS2inl3z8)
* My body doesn't like many carbs +200g / day
* I didn't improved my strength while being on Keto
* Keto improved my endurance
* I found that best diet for me is 80/20 Paleo diet (not taking it too seriously) and eat ~0g of carbs when I don't train and eat 0-50g before training and 50-100g after training (depends on how hard is training)

Worst: 1) High carbs, high protein, low fat - first week was ok but after that I have noticed I had energy problems in longer workouts (I ""hit"" the wall few times which doesn't happen to me at all), also I started to eating more, it was hard for me to control my cravings. On other hand I  felt strong and I hit some PRs on lifts, muscles were overloaded with carbs.

2) Zone diet by CrossFit Journal - first 2 weeks I have struggled with finding correct amount of blocks that would suit to me, (I am small/medium guy but I eat more than my 10-15 kg heavier friends). Zone was great, I have learned some info about how much carbs are in different fruits/veggies but it was still diet with too much carbs through day. E.g. my body doesn't like carbs after morning. Energy levels during workouts were great but I didn't noticed any special improvents while being on the Zone.

3) Keto/very low carbs (&lt;50g/day) - I have been on this kind of diet for the longest time. I was eating only veggies and had fruit only about 2-3 times per week. Being on this diet for very long time helped my body to use more fats and less carbs as energry source during long CrossFit workouts, thanks to that diet I was able to run marathon, train +60 minute interval workouts on rower and excel in long hero workouts. Only one problem of this diet was that I didn't improved my power lifts (deadlift, squat, strict press) but I only improved technique movements, olympic lifts (snatch, clean&amp;jerk). Also it is very hard to train CrossFit hard 5-6 times per week and gain weight while being on Keto.

Best: 4) 80/20 Paleo, No/Low carbs all day + carbs before/after training - this is how I actually eat at the moment and for now it is the best diet for me. Rules are simple eat meat/fish/eggs, a lot of veggies, some fruit, nuts, seeds and oils. Before and after training you are allowed to eat carbs, I eat like 0-50g before and 50-100g of carbs after training, mainly from potatoes/sweet potatoes, rice and fruit. 80/20 rule applies to cheat meals, I eat about 2-3 cheat meals per week. Why it suits me so much? Thanks to lower carbs I am still able to do well on long/endurance workouts but I am also able to gain strength thanks to some carbs after training and my body recovers better from hard workouts. Amount of carbs before/after training depends on how hard traning will be/was.

If you are new to CrossFit nutrition and I hope that little research helped you to decide how much carbs you should eat. Also don't forget that everyone has different body and if something is great for me than it doesn't mean that you would do well on same nutrition. Play with you nutrition and find out what is best for you
