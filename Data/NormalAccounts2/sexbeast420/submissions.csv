Instead of an interior monologue like most people have, I have an interior *dialogue*. When I wrote down my thoughts, I realized that there are TWO distinct voices in my head- one which is me, and the other is this other voice that talks shit to me / yells at me / interrogates me. The voices are always fighting.

For example:

**Voice 1**: ""My friendship with X is based on a unique mutually-shared societal-observation-based sense of humor""

**Voice 2**: ""That was an awfully arrogant thought. There is nothing special about your sense of humor. You are just like everyone else. Why do you feel the need to characterize your friendship with X?""

I have tried DMT, LSD, mushrooms, 2c-b, and salvia. On my eleventh time doing LSD, something unexplainable happened- I came to this realization and all of a sudden everything made sense. I just started laughing, as if I had figured all of life out. I thought I had found the answer to everything; I thought all my suffering was over, I had total peace of mind. 

After the effects of the drug wore off, I resumed life as normal, wondering what the hell happened to me. It wasn't until a few weeks later that I discovered this subreddit and saw a mention of a book called ""The Power of Now"" by Eckhart Tolle. I started reading it, and the quote about his enlightening experience at the beginning of the book piqued my interest. 

I started reading up on the idea of ""enlightening"" experiences, focusing mainly on the Buddhist concept of ""enlightenment"". I started to delve deeper into Buddhism, never before having read or known anything about the philosophy. It all made so much inherent sense to me. It was like I had been developing this philosophy on my own for my entire life- but it turns out that this philosophy has existed for thousands of years. 

I believe my enlightening experience on LSD was an example of what Buddhists call ""Satori"", which from my understanding is like a temporary glimpse into Nirvana. 

I just think it's crazy how I got to that without having any clue about what it was / what it meant. I've begun to practice Vissipana meditation, and I'm starting to read up a lot on Buddhism. It's some very interesting stuff. What do you guys think of the idea of enlightenment / Nirvana / Satori?
