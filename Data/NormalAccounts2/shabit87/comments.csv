65,"Firstly let me say I do NOT sell hundreds a day. I do PL and max cap to date is 30, not a whole lot, but then again the demand isn't as great either for my products, but here's some tidbits for you.

1. Spend as much time as you can choosing your product. Research using tools like JungleScout to evaluate competition. Get an estimate of sales per month and see if anyone one product listing is seemingly dominating or is there a trickle down effect that suggest there's plenty of room in the pie (ex. GOOD - Top Seller 1 does an estimated $20K/month, Top Seller 2 does ~$18,K/month, Top Seller 3 does ~$15K/month, Top Seller 4 does ~$12K/month | BAD - Top Seller 1 does ~$30K/month, Top Seller 2 does ~$9K/month, Top Seller 3 does ~$2K/month)

2. Be sure to check for patents.

3. Learn to evaluate competition. How many others are selling and how well do they present their offer? If you see a lot of first page results for multiple variations of your keyword phrase that have weak listings, you may have found opportunity to come in strong and fast!

4. Any opportunity to have a better product? Check out the negative reviews and see if there is an opportunity for you to resolve common issues that keep coming up.

5. Avoid brand heavy items. Most (dare I say most) wouldn't start to sell diapers...let Huggies, Luvs, and Pampers fight it out. Try not to go where there's a good chance your customer is searching specifically by or with brand (ex. searching Nike socks vs. scuba diving socks).

6. Everyone has already said it but yes, don't underestimate Amazon's PPC, pretty simple to use too and to get started you can make an auto campaign and let Amazon source out keywords for you.

Hope this helps you on your way to PL riches :-D

119,"You have no money, then you better make or rather manage the time.

Scenario 1:
You start small and want to make it big (this is my understanding of bullet 1). If you start small, validate that this is a viable business you can expand using your audience. In this case, I'd certainly build a community of buyers and interested parties, expanding may mean a few things for you, going to other locations (if geo specific), adding new products and services, etc. Make every next step an event and have people invest their resources (any don't just limit yourself to money) with making the bigger vision happen. This is where a good story and a powerful mission come into play. It won't be easy by any means and not fast, but it can be steady. Have a clear idea of where you want to be and how to get there...steps &amp; action. Monitor results and adjust where needed.

Scenario 2:
You can't stop people from taking your idea, twisitng it or making it better. Your goal should be to be the best, you will of course have the customers first and the data, take it and build...build your product/service, strengthen your position, keep your focus on being the best! Not saying don't be aware of competition, be mindful of them of course, but focus the efforts on YOU, not destroying or worrying about them.

Last bit of advice...don't let the unknown stop you from taking action. It seems (and of course I don't know) but you are worrying about things yet to exists and possibly talking yourself out of action. Now it's not bad if you decide to move forward with something else, but make sure it's a choice you make and not one you let fear make for you. All the very best my friend.

159,"My Complete cold call script looks something like this:

Mr/Mrs XYZ, I'm shabit87 calling from ABC software company. Our software helps catering services increase productivity by putting recipe costs and ingredients, customer info and delivery schedules into one easy to use program. 

What I'd like to do is get a better understanding of what solution your catering service is currently using. What times are most appropriate for you to meet in person next week? I can schedule a phone meeting as well.

In regards to email, my target customer is a meals on wheels service/caterer, or restaurant. It's typically easier to call a DM during their slow time (so if I'm calling a restaurant, I'm calling after breakfast and before lunch).

Qualifying questions:
-How do you track your PO vs your actual received order?
-Is employee theft a concern (I ask this because some employees will take home ingredients, I'm always iffy about asking this though)
-Can you walk me through your process in the event you receive a bad batch of meat?
-How do you currently do your sales reports?
-Are you tracking your spoilage costs? If so, how? If no, why not?
-What's your process to rectify a situation if a customer says they were shorted a meal / side dish. Do you have a way to track this?

The most common scenario for objections:
In the restaurant / catering service world, a business will either fail, or exchange hands in under 4 years. So the most common objection happens when a customer has bought a business from somebody else, has gone over their renovation budget and is now panicking.
Their objection typically sounds like ""this is way too expensive, I'll just have to use an excel spreadsheet and a plain cash register."" 

Two things happens at this point:
1)My boss will decide to discount and try to make it up with a service contract
2) We sell them more benefits on why the software is a good idea (features like it'll integrate with their POS and debit terminals, take care of their accounting features etc). 

I get anxiety from picking up the phone, not really sure what causes it. Sometimes it sets me into panic mode and causes me to mess up the pitch.",2016-04-10 19:01:11+00:00,d1xjth9,2.0,t1_d1x7zak,21267.0,sales

Ducking Season is an urban clothing brand representing all the fallen (yes, as in dead) rubber ducks. The duck drowned at bath time by the overly active toddler or the duck flipped over by the guy at the fair trying to win a giant bear for a girl that's never giving it up! Yeah, those forgotten rubber ducks!

I'm looking to provide an exclusive line of men's urban clothing with a truly unique experience with each purchase. Ducking Season is a movement to inspire everyone to ""Dare To Care About Something Strange"" which works well with its mission to build awareness for all fallen rubber ducks.",2015-11-29 22:14:04+00:00,cxh6xwp,1.0,t3_3urmca,37.0,streetwearstartup

I would have love to seen your clothing sooner. People are lazy. Show them they've come to the right place before they realize they may have to use a bit of common sense (i.e scrolling down).

So maybe have an image of someone or people wearing the clothing as the main picture, which reassures them that not only is it a clothing shop but prompts them to scroll down to get more about the picture...which should lead them to your additional pics (assuming they just don't hit shop at top, which is possible, people want to investigate before investing).

Example:

Mary in the US will give you 100 caps at $10 each with free shipping costing you $1000

Lou in China will give you 100 caps at $5 each but air express shipping will cost $600 totaling $1100

If quality matches up, you're better off choosing Mary.

Also thought I could get real brands from Alibaba, uh yeah, no. LOL

1. Really depends on the product but almost anything helps. I like video too, it shows them the product from many perspectives and in relation to other items. A tech pack will serve helpful too.

2. I ship them a sample and allow them to tell me if they already have a connection to a supplier of that material. I also work with a third party sometimes to help me find a supplier.

3. Yes always order samples please never order bulk without ordering samples EVER.

4. So they say what their MOQ is all the time, but you can talk them down. Simply state you want to check market demands before committing to larger orders, you can also position and request it as a one time courtesy.

The other hats, I don't think there is anything that really makes it unique. Also I think the font is a bit small, now this is just a preference thing with my hat, but again really love the one on IG that resembles the flag.

Also when you make it hard for customers to throw something away it acts as what JC calls a mini billboard.

Simply put, there can be 101 reasons why someone hasn't backed a project and I am not as quick to judge why as long as the campaign is of interest and there is a good amount of proof the project will be fulfilled.

I have 11 years experience importing, but I had no clue for Amazon what to import and I though ASM would help, it didn't.

I later found another course that helped me to earn $3300 my first month with the, the course cost me $497, best investment ever. It's now more like $1K, but I'd pay it again in a heartbeat!
