1. If you have a reward card, compare and contrast the value of your rewards for how they are redeemed, for example, I found that some reward cards will give you $50, whereas for the same amount of ""points"" you can get a $100 gift card. Get a gift card where you would shop anyhow OR get a popular card and sell online or Craigslist, you can still get a significant amount more cash redeeming that way than the cash/credit option.

*Understand your point system. If you get 3 points for groceries, 2 for gas, and 1 for everything else and the 3 points are calculated via stores (Publix, Kroger, Piggly-Wiggly, for example) start to purchase gift cards with your credit card to get more points for purchases you'll be making shortly after. For example, I need groceries, gas, and a t-shirt (earning 3 for groceries, 2 for gas, 1 for the shirt) I can get a $25 shell gas card while at Publix and a $20 Forever 21 gift card for the shirt.

2. Take advantage of the perks that may come with you being a Visa or Mastercard holder (usually more rewards for those with a limit of $5K or more). Some of the basics, travel insurance, auto renter damage coverage usually up to $50K, extended warranty on purchased merchandise, lost luggage reimbursement, roadside assistance (last 2 usually for the $5K+ limits).

*I like to use my credit card to hold car rentals, then when I return I switch out with my debit card so I at least have the protection IF something where to happen but without necessarily having the charge, just the temporary hold.

3. Some cards will give you extra points for shopping with it at certain stores online...if you need to go to Footlocker anyhow and can wait, shop online and get the extra points.

4. Every once in a while, 2-3 months, call to see about lowering interest rate, 0% balance transfers, etc. For some wild reason, there will be promos on an account that the credit card company won't necessarily promote...why? Because it'll cost them money to notify you and for the savvy users, they'll lose money. Again, never hurts to ask.

5. If you're doing a return at a store you regularly shop, return and opt for store credit or a gift card. You can keep the points you've earned and of course you'll still have funds to get something to replace your returned item(s). Of course this will not always make sense to do, just an option to keep in mind. And of course if you find you really shouldn't have spent money period, then it's probably best to return funds to the card.

Part II - THE BASICS

1. The obvious, to avoid interest pay off the card by the end of the billing cycle and know that usually your due date and cycle end date are two different days (of course, pay your minimum by due date...the cycle end date is usually only a few days following).

2. Call to get fees waived, never hurts.

3. Know that (usually) using your card for Western Union and the like will result in the interest rate for the cash segment, not purchases. Sometimes (usually) this rate is higher and it the interest fee is not voided for paying off in full.

4. Cash transactions (money wiring/transferring, incoming balance transfers, atm withdraws, some payments to auto &amp; mortgage companies, etc.) will almost never earn points/rewards.

Broken things I had made, my moms quilt she had made, if things were in sets only a part of set was taken (petty I know but for example I have my blender lid to glass and the base.

-Start treating this like a business...yep, nothing else needs to be said there
-If you're truly building a brand, invest in it. Get a more unique look, take the time to redesign to address common complaints, and more importantly TRADE MARK!
-Try and get as much done via your manufacture as possible, they have connections ya know (inserts, packaging, labels, etc.)!? 
-Stop talking, stop asking, and START taking action!

And here is my personal bonus to all who have read to this point. Go to eBay, search your item, check 'completed listings' to left. See if it ""lights up"" green, indicating an item sold. Know that you can always liquidate there (but don't exclude other places like CL, local businesses, etc.) if you were wrong with choosing a PL idea or the product.

Any advice is greatly appreciated. I'm in Georgia. Moved in my unit and only a day later I discover it had roaches. That's unacceptable. I opted to end my lease early with 60 day notice with one month's rent fee of $650 &amp; was told verbally I would have until the 17th before apartments filed for eviction. 

The 4th it was put into collections to a company called Rent Recovery. I call to get the balance it's over $800, but I'm told all documents have not been uploaded. I call back and it's $1100. I ask for the breakdown. $200-300 is a non paid electric fee. However I have proof from my electric company thank goodness to show this is not true. The rest however almost $400 is unaccounted for...the apartments don't state why I owe it. 

Now here is the issue. I'm told April 4th the collections account will report to my credit and I'll have a judgement. I want to pay and be done with this but not paying what I don't owe. It's a waiting game and I don't have the time. How can I get ahead of this and avoid paying what I don't owe, should I be filing something NOW?",legaladvice,"Ended lease early due to pests.

I'm new to clothing and starting a line but I have 11 years experience with importing (mostly from China, India, and Italy to the US). When I first started I did use Alibaba and sites like it (trust me guys the site has come a lonnnngggg way). I'd like to lend my expertise in using Alibaba to your advantage and avoiding scams.

1. Use Alibaba GOLD suppliers only symbolized with a yellow goldish circle by the year they've been on Alibaba

2. Only use Alibaba suppliers with 3+ years on the site, by then if they were doing something wrong the likelihood they would be caught is substantial.

3. Use Alibaba suppliers that are manufactures vs trader (see company profile details&gt;company type) and if unsure simply ask...if they are both that is fine, you'll want to ask if hey manufacture your specific good.

4. Make sure your supplier is true to their niche. Don't go with someone who sells glasses, socks, and mp3 players, you want to go for someone who specializes in packaging, or a certain type of material. Basically don't work with those who are trying to please everyone instead of perfecting what the supply.

5. NEVER EVER (LIKE EVER) pay using Western Union or the like.

6. Buy/Request samples before getting bulk orders. And no it's not sketchy for them to ask you to pay shipping.

7. Allow 24-48 hours, remember a lot of suppliers are abroad in a wild time zone. Don't be afraid to use skype or email and not just Alibaba's messaging center.

8. For your bulk order if your supplier accepts PayPal use your credit card. If anything goes belly up you can dispute via PayPal, if they don't side in your favor, hit up MasterCard, Visa, Etc 

Feel free to ask anything else I may have left out. Happy sourcing!",streetwearstartup,"Properly Using Alibaba for Hangtags, Clothing, Packaging, Etc",https://www.reddit.com/r/streetwearstartup/comments/3rnd0v/properly_using_alibaba_for_hangtags_clothing/

I have 2000 items coming this weekend and these Amazon fees are ridiculous, help!""

I said I'll help you if I can make you a case study. He agreed. So we came up with...

&gt;&gt;&gt;Pizza and Pacino Night&lt;&lt;&lt;

Text messages to select friends reading: 
Free Pizza Sunday at 7PM...feel free to bring 1 friend

2000 goods needed to be labeled, Amazon cost: $400

RESULTS:
Total folks to show up: 6
Total cost of pizza: 4 slices per 6 = 24 slices/3 pizzas for $30 (including delivery tip)
Put on Scarface, as we watch and as we wait pitch is made, 
""Hey guys, thanks for coming out to my Pizza and Pacino Night. I brought you here to night to enjoy a movie, eat pizza, and while we wait, I'd love your help placing labels on these small little boxes. Selling these helped me to pay for pizza tonight. We'll stop once pizza gets here and never speak of it again (light laugh)""

EVERYONE was on board...grateful even!

Cost of pizza = $30
6 people labeling avg. 80 products before pizza arrived = 480
Cost for Amazon to label 480 = $96
Savings $66

BUT WAIT...THERE'S MORE!

Even though I said we could stop after pizza arrived, after everyone ate, they went back to labeling for me.

6 people labeling avg 210 products during ""Scarface"" = 1260 products
Totaling 1740 products labeled.
My cost $30...Amazon's charging fee $348

Key take aways: 

1. Make your night a theme, i.e. ""Pizza &amp; Pacino""
2. Let your guest know that what they are helping with is the reason you can hold your special event.
3. Offer an end point. Don't make them feel as if this IS the event.
4. Have them invite a friend, but limit your guests to your comfort and needs.

*Note: My friend already had a laser printer and labels, so that expense was not included in this case study

Introduce yourself and share helpful hints, funny stories, pics, etc. Then reach out to admin, explain you've been working on a product and would love feedback (note I said feedback not reviews) from the group. Mention you in no way want to sell to them and to protect their privacy you're happy to put the product on Amazon so all personal info is kept in their records not yours and provide a coupon that'll make it free. 

I like this option vs Facebook review groups for a few reasons. 

1) You don't have to worry so much about sellers possibly lurking around for product ideas, thus creating competition

2) You, get the boost of sales (helping your BSR) and honest feedback FROM THOSE WHO ACTUALLY USE YOUR PRODUCT TYPE to improve on your product before getting too many nit picky Amazon buyers.

3) You can follow up through Amazon, not necessarily Facebook asking for the feedback.",FulfillmentByAmazon,"Alternative to Facebook Review Groups for Reviews, Sales Boosts, Etc",http://www.reddit.com/r/FulfillmentByAmazon/comments/3c4pzh/alternative_to_facebook_review_groups_for_reviews/
