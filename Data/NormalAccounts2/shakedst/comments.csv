1. I really dont like the UI, and the xp change is nice
2.Soldier's buff only takes 1 less shot to kill 200 hp enemies, and 4 less shots to kill 500 hp enemies. Doesn't seem really significant, but he also didnt need a lot of buff. (I think buffing his recoil will be better)
3. Torb's buff also isn't really changing something too. because scrap regen doesnt really change anything, hes got the same abilities and everything, He's still not gonna be played
4. D.VA +100 hp is really unneccesary, and the 2x faster movement while firing is great, the slower ult is great too.
5.Ana speed boost nerf - The text doesnt really say anything, need to see it in my eyes
