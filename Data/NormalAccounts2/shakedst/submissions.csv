1. Let us report people for griefing/trolling. When I'm with trollers in my team and I try to report them, I see there is no option to report that. I took this idea from CSGO (even the report system there is basically useless because valve)
and if blizzard will really listen to reports, it can be really useful. 
2. Let us surrender after a teammate leaves (or even without it).
There are games when youre 5v6, and are hopless, and youre just wasting time not doing anything because youre 5v6. So if blizzard let us after a teammate leaves, with a loss counting, but reducing less SR and wasting less time, it would be great.

All you need/can do is hitting trees and rocks, even kills doesn't give xp, and it gives no motivation to fight or do something, exactly like the bp system.
I also think you get the first actual ranged weapon in lvl 7, which takes WAY too much time to get to, and makes it even more boring, especially when guns come only in LVL 14!!!",playrust,XP system talk,https://www.reddit.com/r/playrust/comments/4oys5r/xp_system_talk/
