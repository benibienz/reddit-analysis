I just checked manta and the location you spawn at is indeed random. It's either north, west, south or east of your original position, so since he was walking diagonally he had a 50/50 chance I guess.

I don't know how far manta moves you exactly so idk how close you have to be to the coils max range but I guess it's pretty dang close, no doubt.

As I said I'm not saying it's easy it's just not based on timing but positioning and luck which I'd say is easier.

I'd suggest you stick to a role rather than heroes and try to get better at that role through guides and such. If your five heroes are a mix of mids, carries and supports its hard to improve since theres a million things to consider for each role.
Also I'd divide your games into games where you try new heroes/play casual and games where you actively try to get better and focus on what you're doing/should be doing - if you play carry watch your lasthits, practice keeping the creepwave close to your tower and farming efficiency. If your playing support watch the clock, stack and pull camps, contest runes and try not to take your carries xp etc.

Go for heroes that you can't go wrong with. If you wan't to play carry that could be like Sven, Slark or Juggernaut - if you want to play support go for Venge, Omni, Lion or Maiden.

Also stick to heroes that are easy to execute (I see some wisp, underlord, chen, pugna, visage etc in there - mostly great heroes ^^^^sorry ^^^^visage but you really need to know what you're doing).

Try to communicate, *ask* them to do stuff instead of *telling* them to do so and just try to be a leader. It all comes down to how you approach them basically.

101,"You should head over to /r/learndota2 and ask for help over there. :)

Drow is a great hero to start with tho! 
Pay close attention to your positioning because you are very squishy and will lose your damage when people get too close to you. 
Also pay attention to timing since you hit your powerspikes at level 6 and 11 and after getting dragon lance basically. So you want to gather some people and push towers when you hit those timings most of the time. Drow falls off in the lategame against other hard carries so make use of her early-midgame strength and establish map control by taking towers whenever possible!

This is very basic of course and you will get better and better once you start understanding the flow of the game better.

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH9W8N0vjKw) is pretty advanced but he is really good at breaking down small things this drow does and why she does so, just don't get overwhelmed.
