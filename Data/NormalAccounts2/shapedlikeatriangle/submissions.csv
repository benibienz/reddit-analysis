Hi, I'm not sure whether this has been discussed here yet, but I just stumbled on [this](http://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/273770/lure-module-bug) thread because my lures and my incense weren't working properly and didn't increase the amount of pokemon spawning.

My phone was a couple of minutes ahead and not set to network time, and after changing that both lures and incense are working just fine, just tried it. 

I hope this is helpful to some.

EDIT: For all the people asking whether this is real or confirmed; all I can say is that it worked for me.

There are no absolute favorites in the scene right now. Of course some teams have been looking really strong while others haven't, but skillwise almost every team (except Secret LUL) can take games off of every other team if they bring their a-game and a lot seems to be working in the meta right now.

Maybe it's just because I haven't been following the pro scene this much in a long time, but I feel like it hasn't been this open and even in a really long time. This makes for some really amazing games, I love it.

I'm not sure whether that was stated somewhere or not, but I just wasted a bunch of money on that.
