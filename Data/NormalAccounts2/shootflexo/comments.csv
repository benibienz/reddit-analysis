That's basically what I'm discussing with you. It was the point you originally brought up.

One guy said:

and you said:
&gt; Yes. All women come in different shapes, sizes and heights; does that mean that some women should be disallowed from competing in a sports just because she is a different size than the average woman? No. 

So we are asking how you think it is fair for someone who has the genetic capabilities of a male to compete with woman. If you think this is fair, try looking up the battle of the sexes tennis match where a male tennis player ranked 202 beat both Williams sisters back to back in matches that weren't even close, when they were ranked top 5 for women.

202,"The answer to that question ranges from ""Not really"" to ""Not at all"". Those games might all be called Final Fantasy but they are from a variety of different genres. 7,8, and 9 are traditional single player rpgs that have a main story that could be compared to a quest. But it doesn't give any xp, rather just guides you through the game. All of the levels are gained by fighting battles, most of which are not required by the storyline.

Tactics is a strategy rpg where you mainly level up through random fights.

Then FFXI is the Final Fantasy mmo. This is about as wide open as it gets. You start with no goal or direction at all and can go do whatever you want. There is a trivial series of storyline quests that never need to be completed and consist only of fighting things anyway. If you did choose to do those quests, the amount of xp you'd get from completing them would be less than 1% of the xp needed to get to the level needed to do the quest, and would only come from killing things.

Then if the password was 29 characters long, it would be around 128 bit, which already is basically uncrackable.

Here's a couple links:

This one just tells how many bits of entropy the password you type in has
http://rumkin.com/tools/password/passchk.php



And this one is a math equation where the ""64"" is the bits and the 4 billion is how many combinations are tried per second. The result is then how long it would take to crack. So with a computer trying 4 billion combinations per second, it would take 146 years to crack a 64 bit password.

289,"How do you evaluate if you would win when you are only better in some of the areas and they are better in others though? Say you have 10 morale vs 9.3 and 115% discipline vs 110%, but they have .5 more military tactics, a general with the same amount of fire and one more shock, and you're fighting into an area that isn't a mountain but also isn't flat? How many soldiers do you need to win, same amount, 10% more?",2015-09-25 13:14:16+00:00,cvdp17j,5.0,t1_cvdfpsd,31557.0,eu4
290,More of a culmination of the touchiness of the comments. If I would have known that saying 12v7 would have pissed this many people off I would have just said 12v10. It was 100% innocent and I was only trying to think of an example from a game I haven't played for a year.,2015-09-24 23:00:57+00:00,cvd4vi1,5.0,t1_cvd4qzk,212.0,eu4
291,Not at all what I said. I've played the game for 293 hours and I know how things work most of the time. I said that I wanted to know if the game's combat has changed in the last year and if there is a guide I could give my friends that explains the basic combat rules so they would want to try fighting more.,2015-09-24 22:57:53+00:00,cvd4rlq,7.0,t1_cvd133s,6034.0,eu4
292,"&gt; You don't lose 12v7 so many times that you quit fighting unless you are fundamentally fucking up the combat system.

I actually meant this sentence to be worded a little differently when I was writing this post, I meant for it to say something like ""There were numerous times where someone would lose a fight they thought they should win such as this..."" and use that as an example.

No, we weren't losing early game fights like that all over the place but there were many times where someone had a much bigger army and couldn't figure out why.

I just used 12v7 as an example off the top of my head, I had no idea that the exact numbers had anything to do with asking 1) if there have been any changes to the combat system in the last year and 2) is there a good guide I can give my friends to help them figure out what's what.",2015-09-24 22:50:27+00:00,cvd4i9z,6.0,t1_cvd0tws,5980.0,eu4
293,"This is pretty much what I was looking for. I do know most of this stuff except I was still sort of unsure how maintains worked because it seemed like they were just better for the smaller army regardless of if they were attacking or defending. The river crossings are also very confusing, it seems like its almost impossible to avoid getting the penalty if there is a river anywhere near you even if you cross over a section that has no river on it.

So, most likely you can't just have better everything with everyone you fight. I can't imagine that the strategy is just ""have the best of all stats"". So then you need to know how big of a difference all of these things make.

You don't think figuring out who would win in a battle with x% more discipline compared x amount less military tactics plus this moral difference and a leader with 2 more fire but one less shock is complicated?",2015-09-24 22:29:39+00:00,cvd3s1a,4.0,t1_cvd0m1v,5059.0,eu4

297,"I've played the game for like 250 hours, it's happened. It's not all that impossible though maybe each time it happened there was one factor that was uneven. I think one of the times I remember it happening was with a Persian country and we figured out that they started with tech 2 military and were going against tech 3. Another time was vs France and realizing how strong their early leaders were, but I also remember quite a few battles vs Aragon where we couldn't figure out what happened.

edit: I could have sworn that when I played, every country did not start with 3/3/3 tech and at least the nomad techs had 2/2/2.
