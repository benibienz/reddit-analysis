I've seen other things online about top jobs at big companies like Amazon or Netflix paying two or three times that.

I had been thinking of aiming for front end web development, as I am already very comfortable with some of the basics (html, css, some javascript), but I can't imagine that it is possible to have a salary anywhere near that of a software engineer. At the same time, it's probably not going to be nearly as hard to learn what would be required to get a job as a front end developer compared to software engineer, at least for me where I currently stand.

So, what is the career outlook for a front end developer compared to a software engineer? What is a good starting range, 5 year experience range, senior range for each?

    HTML5/HTML Templating (Slim, ERB, etc.)

    Javascript/JQuery/AJAX/JS Frameworks (Angular, Backbone, etc.)
    Responsive Web Design and frameworks (Foundation, Bootstrap)

    Javascript testing (Jasmine, Karma, Protractor, etc.)
    QA experience, attention to detail, bug issue creation
    Task Runner experience (grunt, gulp, rake, etc.)
    Experience deploying code to a production environment
    Experience with cross-browser compatibility including mobile
    Experience developing with an eye toward accessibility
    Experience with pattern libraries and front-end style guides
    Git, Github
    Prototyping tools (InVision, Marvel, etc.)
    (preferred) Experience with popular CMSs (Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla)
    (preferred) Native Mobile Apps (Android and IOS)
    (preferred) Ruby on Rails
    (preferred) Retail or e-commerce experience

For example, the wiki says Mccree's revolver does 70 damage per shot but it says Soldier 76's does 5-17 and Tracer does 1.5-6. I assume this is damage falloff? Does this mean that Mccree's weapon can shoot across any distance and till do 70 damage or that it just does full damage to it's max range and the after that it won't hit anything?

Also, how can we tell what the falloff ranges are? I assume that Soldier 76 can shoot further before his falloff brings the damage down to the low end when compared to Tracer?

What about Widowmaker? Her regular snipe says it does 17-150. Does this just mean it has a super long range and does 150 from point blank up to a decent distance, then starts to fall off?

He didn't like that they no longer gave you manpower or tax money and he couldn't control what they did.

Was the introduction of colonial nations just purposely to nerf colonization because it was just too easy to get strong?

Also, is getting a colonial nation worth it, and why?

If I want to be able to send a merchant to a trade node that I can't reach yet, how can I tell how much more range I need in order to be able to reach it?


2. Are there any penalties for collecting trade in a big node that isn't connected to your home node compared to using your home node? Assuming you have the trade range and supply range to send a merchant and a ton of light ships there.

3. When playing to dominate trade, do you usually just try to totally own your home node and the 3-5 nodes pointing downstream to it, or is it worth also focusing on collecting in other unrelated nodes?",eu4,A few questions about Trade,https://www.reddit.com/r/eu4/comments/3mze9j/a_few_questions_about_trade/

I generally play safe and only make moves if the opponent messes up/is out of position. Lots of games feel like I'm not really doing anything wrong but the game is just over despite that. It is very frustrating. I would like to know if there really are big things/mistakes I'm making or not doing that a diamond player would be doing in my shoes in order to carry the game, or if I am just getting a bad string of games.

I have a couple recent Amumu jungle replays from yesterday up on aof.gg, which is a pretty cool replay website that can automatically record all your games. To watch them, you just need to download the client and download the specific replay for the game.

Here's those two replays and a link to the replay client:

There are numerous times I would try to help them figure out why their early game army of 12k lost to an army of 7k when they both had the same tech level, leaders were similar and there was no river crossing penalty. There were plenty of times like this all throughout the game that eventually led to no one ever wanting to fight because they had no idea if they would win.

So instead, I was alone in a lot of the fighting and they would colonize. It felt more like we were all playing a single player game at the same time.

Has anything changed in the patches since then to eliminate having to do a research paper before moving your units to fight an enemy army?

If no, is there any kind of guide that can explain this clearly?

I am aware of the impact of ideas, leaders, terrain, tech level and units, overall discipline and morale but still I would lose fights sometimes and have no idea why.",eu4,Has combat improved at all?,https://www.reddit.com/r/eu4/comments/3m8ux1/has_combat_improved_at_all/
