0,I hope you get yours soon! This is a super comfy bra. I wish more companies did cool prints like this one.,2016-11-22 01:23:55+00:00,daacw7b,2.0,t1_da9blfh,58943.0,ABraThatFits
1,"Hi! This bra appears to be a pretty decent fit. However, as didntwantawave points out, it flattens the top of your breast a smidge. This is because you are more full on top then the bra is designed for and that's fine! I think the rest of the bra is a perfectly acceptable fit if you'd like to keep the bra. I have several bras that are a smidge too tight for my upper fullness.

I don't have any specific recommendations but halfcups tend to be more open and fot friendly.",2016-11-21 05:25:45+00:00,da96o1c,1.0,t3_5e24w9,4359.0,ABraThatFits

3,"If you prefer looser bands I'd say size up. You can always take the band in, although all signs point to the 80HH running tight too-a quick Bratabase check shows 80 bands stretching to ~34. You can also email and see if Comexim will do a 4 row hook instead of the typical 3 (I *think* that alteration is called a 3x4 hook fastener).",2016-10-28 02:52:27+00:00,d9axm7e,5.0,t1_d9axdyy,334.0,ABraThatFits
4,"You can still email them!! Email them and see if they will make it for you. They are *super* accommodating. 

As for sizing, I don't think I can be super helpful. :( I wear a 30F in UK sizes but have to size up to a 65HH to get a decent fit in Comexim, which, according to Comexim's size charts, is their ninth letter (as opposed to the UK's seventh.

According to Bratabase, *most* Comexim 75J plunges have a pretty much identical cup depth as your Panache Jasmine. If that fits well, that's the size I reccomend you start with. The bands run consistently tight though by varying amounts. ",2016-10-28 01:54:19+00:00,d9av5si,3.0,t1_d9aoanl,10006.0,ABraThatFits

12,"Based on the photos, I'd recommend going up one cup size and maybe trying a different style. While the S is relatively projected, it does not have as much immediate projection (projection at the wires) as the CHP does. With breasts as projected as yours, you'll need as much immediate projection as you can go. Correct me if I'm wrong, but 80 is equivalent to a UK 36 band? So I'd recommend trying an 80H if you'd like to stick to a tight band or 85GG if you want to try a looser one.

13,"I'd stick to your regular size unless you're extremely center full. In which case, it might help to size up as the plunge cut (at least in my personal experience) can cut into center-fullness resulting in minor quad.",2016-07-07 23:12:16+00:00,d53ik01,1.0,t3_4rmls6,69277.0,ABraThatFits

15,Kaska is great! I've heard that Ewa can come across as blunt/rude but I've never actually dealt with her myself. Kaska was very helpful and helped me special order an M style as an S which fits better.,2016-07-06 23:23:06+00:00,d523i9q,1.0,t3_4rhgkw,55106.0,ABraThatFits
16,"Adding on to this. You can tell it gives support because her breasts are above her imf, which is what a good bra does. Freya unlined (and most unlined) give a more natural shape but still manage incredible support.

17,"Hi, sorry to piggyback off your comment but I have several Ewas in the S and CHP styles. I wear a 30F UK but need a 65FF in Ewa's bras. I'm not sure of op's shape but the CHPs are more open on top with more immediate projection while the Ss are more closed on top with more projection at the apex. I'd definitely recommend at least one cup size up from the UK size.

20,Thank you for your awesome reviews! I love the bluebell colourway of Marcie but I haven't gotten a chance to try it yet. The Skye is also absolutely gorgeous. Sad to hear about the Hettie. If you're getting wrinkling down in the bottom of the cups you probably need a bra with more immediate depth-you could be getting wrinkles because your breasts are pushing the wires down a little to find the depth they need.,2016-07-02 02:28:25+00:00,d4w6epu,1.0,t3_4qs6hv,41154.0,ABraThatFits

24,"I agree with the second poster. You need to look for bras that have more immediate depth because the wires aren't snug to your breasts at the bottom-in your inframmary fold where they are supposed to be. I have most of my experience with Polish bras so I'm basing it off of that and the one Freya I tried, but half cups might be better. They tend to have more immediate projection and work well for even fullness and are a little narrower. Freya has several halfcup styles if you would like to stick with a brand you already have experience with.",2016-06-30 02:34:37+00:00,d4th15k,1.0,t3_4qgiy2,35375.0,ABraThatFits
