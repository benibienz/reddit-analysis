As the title says, I need a sports bra! I am narrow and projected, relatively even. I am petite so the less 'bra' the better and fully adjustable straps are a big priority. I need a medium impact sports bra. My best fit is Ewa Michalak in 65FF. The lower the price the better!

I tried one out in a medium and realized that it was molded. All in all, for the price (around 30 dollars) it was okay. The wires didn't seem very sturdy and the materials seemed cheapish but decent. I didn't buy it because it did not fit. It was too big and too small all at the same time. I think that the medium would best fit a 34/36 banded woman who was wide-set, shallow, wide, and didn't need too much support. I have a full review up on my blog if anyone wants specifics.
