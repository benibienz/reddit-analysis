I myself will keep supporting things that relate to this issue. However, those long-term projections are usually inaccurate. NY should already be underwater. That doesn't mean we can be careless by any standard. This issue has many fronts: how we choose to live, the world scale, and government outside of the federal branch (states are government too).

That's a big generalization. I voted for Trump knowing full well what I voted for and have no regret. He's not the ideal candidate, but there was a lot to fear with the other candidate.

100,"I'll tackle this best I can. I think most of these songs are intentionally a bit vague.

Overload:
I see this song as about finding something that makes you experience a strong sense of emotion. Probably alien discovery in context(?). As it appears to me, it seems like it's about seeking something that means so much to you emotionally even though other people can't relate. The second verse especially reinforces this to me, and combined with the way the chorus rushes into ""when you see it do you overload?"" and ""every minute is an episode"" makes me think of the surge I get whenever I'm able to fly back to my home, since I live elsewhere and likely will never get to permanently move back. My home makes me overload, and I think this song is Tom capturing that feeling. 

Artillery has very intense verses that could be about anything, really. It seems like it's about a massive realization in the first verse, as it's full of that sort of imagery. Then the second verse is explaining that no one else remotely gets it (anyone why can't you hear it; a voice that's out of range / messengers lost magicians, engage the tidal wave). The chorus fits with this theme very well, giving this realization an element of danger. 

I also personally get a theme of abandonment in this song. ""I never even caught your name, you never even had the time"", ""the words are like a death tonight"". It just sounds like someone rushed into a relationship that didn't even work out from the first moment in retrospect. 

Voyager is the clearest song to me. It's about you understanding yourself clearly, which fits with where Tom seems to be in life. The song sounds like this crazy realization that your ambition, your opinions, your thoughts matter most to you, and might just form something incredible. The chorus yells this loudly with lines like: ""Watch me as I break the television... I am on my way, unstoppable... Bright and bold, here comes the revolution... The king is on a mission... Pure in heart, a king infallible, great big f'ing time so powerful, I"". I feel like almost every line in the song feeds into this idea. Breaking the television sounds like giving no credence to what everyone else thinks and thinking without outside influence. The rest sounds like you're finally doing your thing. 

I can relate to finally being done with what everyone else forces you into and doing what is right, or piping up after being walked or silenced on in another way, or even just understanding yourself clearly for the first time in a while.

Chasing Shadows sounds like lost love to me, plain and simple. ""but I want here... Here I am, I'm falling to my knees... I'm digging at the shadows of a ghost...I'm sleeping in the gallows that I chose"" it all sounds like you're trying to find your way through and out of loss involving love. 

""I can't move, it hurts forever... I can't bear to remember who I was before the day I met her"" really gets me. I made mistakes that complicatedly ended a relationship in which neither of us would have dreamed of ever ending. Coming to terms with that is taking a long time, and this song really feels like it's about something like that to me.

Anyway, those are my quick thoughts on what each song on the EP means. Sorry if it's a bit messy. (I've made some edits to clean it up)",2016-10-27 06:19:40+00:00,d99nwvf,1.0,t3_59ltei,11757.0,AngelsAndAirwaves

Dammit vs other singles
Pros:
+ Not considered overplayed by most
+ Defintive Blink song
+ Very fun riff
Cons:
- A popular single
- Sub prefers deep cuts
- Lyrics are relatable to youth but not particularly deep, unlike other favorites (I'm Sorry, Lemmings) 

It's not like I thought this was anywhere near impossible, I just thought due to the earlier rounds that singles would probably be out no matter what

I agree with how you see Kaga's plots in this way: I see Kaga's games as trying to reinvent and improve on the style of basic Old English storytelling (similar to Beowulf, stories of an epic hero that looks to save the people and slay a dragon or two), but with a focus on kingdoms as well. That is to say, I think Kaga tried to write the best stories of their type, while Kojima push the boundaries in his storytelling.

I like the Avatars, but they shouldn't be in every game. In the older games, I really liked semi-actively observing a fictional history unfold. 

Then comes FE7 and I was always jarred when characters spoke to me. I didn't like feeling so detached to Mark. There wasn't enough control of your own self. 

 ~~Let's skip Kris~~

Then comes Awakening and I loved the avatars. They were a tad bland, but it all worked out. I got to at least sort of make choices, support characters, and be part of the story without being unbelievably pandered to. 

Those are some of my rough thoughts on avatars. I think Awakening did it well, and it could be improved, but probably only by more choices being given to help you shape your character (think Mass Effect). I think avatar Fire Emblem games should happen in certain games, and absent from others. Being in the story and being outside of it are both exciting to me.",2015-09-22 02:15:33+00:00,cv9r992,1.0,t3_3lvbh1,9935.0,fireemblem
