I've been playing the series for the first time, and by ME3 I figured I knew everything that would happen. I was wrong.

Leviathan blew me away so powerfully firstly because it was visually and mentally stunning. I doubt anyone is fully comfortable with the idea of going to the bottom of a water planet's sea with reaper-sized aliens down there, so I'm pretty sure everyone had a strong response to that, but then as you sink down into the darkness you see an unbelievably massive creature. Wow.

Then comes the story part. I thought I knew the story: ""The Reapers are coming! Oh no!"" It didn't click with me because there wasn't a solid beginning, so to fix that they reveal a massive change to what we knew of the mythos: the Reapers were a construct of the Leviathan due to the need to save organic life from its own synthetics. This made my mind run circles because a big theme in Mass Effect is the conflict between organics and synthetics. I already had enough philosophical thoughts regarding that, especially after Legion's ME3 mission, but Leviathan made it all make sense. I won't and can't go into everything this information means because it gives so much to think about. 

Sorry if this is a messy post, I just wanted to capture the feeling in the moment because I haven't been this impressed by storytelling in a long time.

Now, I've been playing Twin Snakes (sorry PSX version fans), and have been loving it. (Also, HOW WAS THIS GAME RATED T? I haven't seen things so bloody and brutal as the cyborg-ninja sequence in rated M games!) My progress is kind of slow-going as going back to such an aged game isn't always easy. I was gonna save us all the trouble of this post until I finished the game and had my full ""review"" of MGS1, but I was too shocked by the Psycho Mantis fight. This, I'll never forget.

First I notice Merryl acting funny, so of course it was the psychic guy I'd been hearing about. Then there was the incredibly awkward scene where she grabs Snake's... snake to get up and Psycho Mantis jokes ""I thought you liked girls"". That sure was a good first impression. 

Then he goes on to talk about his power and tells me that I avoid traps, which probably just describes Snake in general, but then that I save often? Uhhh, okay. I do. Then that I play Smash Bros and Super Mario Sunshine among other things? The shattering of the fourth wall was really getting me for some reason.

Then he must show me his power firsthand. He tells me to put my controller on the floor and he'll move it. I thought it would be a trap, so I wasn't about to. Then all of a sudden in an intense flash of an animation, Snake looks at me and nods that I should do so. I trusted him, and sure enough, Mantis did move my controller. Soon enough the fight starts, and I shoot my Famas at him only to get a black screen with a green word in the top right corner. Suddenly a nostalgia wave hit me as I realized this was the old black screen from the TVs I used many years ago. 

I eventually had to consult the Internet to figure out how to confuse Mantis' powers via another control port. Clever. Almost as clever as the codec code I needed on the game box I didn't get with the game.

Then after so much goofiness and amusement, Mantis gives an amazingly moving death speech. His tale of his life was quite shocking and deeply affected me. I remember the gist, and many elements such as wanting to die with his mask were haunting, but when he decided to help Snake to help someone once in his life, he calls the feeling of it nostalgic, implying that our ""true"" humanity calls for us all to be good creatures, yet we all get corrupted by our experiences and the cruel world.

Even when everyone else is on a phone, I try to be more organic and enjoy my environment or simply wait like people used to.

I've noticed that even when everyone else around me is playing some game on their cell phone, people verbally criticize me for having my 3DS out in pretty hardcore ways, while my peers play phone games with no backlash. I don't even use my 3DS that often in public. 

In fact, I've go so far as to notice just how glued to their phones my peers are, and the addiction seems rather intense, though no one seems to care. This is intensified about doubly when I'm doing multiplayer with someone.

This album sounds very dream-like in sound and in mentality (as in how dreams remind/form our ideas of concepts).

It's probably not intentional like Tom would like these days, but it is there. Unlike past albums like TOYPAJ that clearly depict life and specific situations, the floaty sounds of Neighborhoods seem to compliment more conceptial lyrics. 

An example is Ghost on the Dancefloor. The floaty intro followed by lyrics that could well describe a dream really give off the feeling of it being a dream where you see a lost/gone loved one. Lines like ""I saw your ghost tonight, the moment felt so real"" and ""but dreams can't all be real"" really sell this idea.

Other songs that really have the ""dream sound"" and are concept-based or even lyrically invoke images of dreams include:

Natives (a fast nightmarish dream)
After Midnight (a peaceful dream of young love)
Love is Dangerous (""her eyes cut through the clouds"")
Fighting the Gravity (dizzy nightmare)
This is Home (euphoric celebration of your teenage years in your true home)

Most if not all songs fit into this somehow too. So, overall, I think the conceptual nature of how dreams can connect to our thoughts and ideas of things, mixed with the dream-like sound of Neighborhoods really gives off a feeling of the album being descriptive of a variety of dreams. I'd like to hear your thoughts!

So I wanted to say some more stuff about the FE games I've played, and maybe get some reccomendations from the community.

I finished FE1 (FE3 version) and really enjoyed that, but man was it hard at times. I can't count my restarts, and each battle took me about an hour. I only lost one unit, Chainy. It was painful to let her die (taken out by SAME TURN REINFORCEMENTS!). It wasn't my first FE death, though, since I let Cynthia in Awakening die after relentlessly getting trying to set it up so she didn't die by counterattack. Great game overall, though, and I'll play FE3 soon

I'm also doing a second play through of Awakening on Hard, and honestly, its about the same difficulty... Gregor and Cordelia have the best supports, by the way. Also, Brady is interesting, I love Owain as always, and I married Lucina and am quite dissapointed that I can't do so in real life. 

Finally, I'm about halfway though Path of Radiance. I needed something with more modern features before FE3. PoR's interface is nice, and the game seems really easy, even on hard. Ike is a beast, though. After the sensitive, soft Marth, the blunt contrast Ike gives is cool. I like that I can make all the fighting occur on the overworld as well. What do you guys think of PoR?

Finally, I want to say for all you wanting to see my suffer, I do plan to play Thracia ;)",fireemblem,My Fire Emblem Journey: PoR,http://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/3c636j/my_fire_emblem_journey_por/

2. He's no longer a sword fighter, but does he ever talk about his sword hand?

Argument 1:
Yes, in a patriarchal royal bloodline, a male king gives the kingship to his male son, creating the most solid, pure-blooded line (with a few exceptions over time, possibly). This means the purity of the bloodline among other things makes Marth about the same as Lucina's dad.

No, a couple thousand years makes this all irrelevant.",fireemblem,"If Marth and Lucina Got Married, Would It Still Be Incest?",http://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/3bk3kt/if_marth_and_lucina_got_married_would_it_still_be/

To anyone who is a dedicated Smash fan who has Smash 4 and is using a controller they feel isn't optimal, I highly reccomend seeking out a GC adapter as they are now easier to find at retail price.

The circumstances look very complicated and I want to make the choice in the game, not at a store. Can anyone help me understand this?
