277,"Wow, your definition is not even close to being correct (though your second sentence is perfectly correct). If you think capitalism is ""merely"" the unrestricted exchange of goods and services then you need to understand a lot more about capitalism's need for profit. I think what you're trying to say is that capitalism is the free pursuit of profit through the exchange of goods and services.

278,"From a Marxist perspective (not communism, if you don't know the difference...) this is precisely the result of these problems of capitalism. Capitalism isn't simply based on the relationship between supply and demand nor the notion that competition is good; capitalism's sole principle is profit as a result of the use of capital regardless of consequences. The expense of creating monopolies, the bribery of politicians (because that's what it is), the complete disregard for consumers and the unwillingness to expand services beyond a minimal threshold are all choices made within a specific set of economic circumstances solely to increase capital, just as most variations of those factors in different circumstances produce different results (hence market variability in quality of services). So, yeah, it's a problem of capitalism. But, then again, most complaints about internet services are equally rooted in selfish desires to have a monopoly of quality all for the user, so any complaints about capitalism are themselves based in a capitalist driven demand. 

Oh, and just being picky but I personally hate the phrase ""competition breeds lower prices"" as if lower prices are born procreatively, as if lower prices started appearing like cute fluffy altruistic little bunnies. Competition creates circumstances of companies fighting for their survival and lower prices are a survival tactic in the vicious warfare that is the capitalist marketplace.

This turned into a battle, with her pointedly reading romance novels propped up on the desk (yes, it was that long ago), pouting and laughing at things I would say, and leaving the classroom if I asked her to stop being disruptive. Well, one day I'm teaching Marx and what his analysis would be on the local economy as part of my discussion of 19th century ideas. Not going hardcore, just what a Marxist analysis of the local labor conditions. In the middle of this she stands up and starts yelling at me that I'm a communist and starts collecting her stuff to leave.

548,"The problem with political correctness is simple: the idea of being correct. Å½iÅ¾ek is making a good point here: just because you can't spell his name correctly (Å½iÅ¾ek vs. Zizek) doesn't necessarily mean that you are disrespecting him or treating him as less important or less human than you are. If I were to comment on everyone's post in this thread who incorrectly spelled his name then I would be being political correct, demanding that everyone write his name correctly with proper Slovenian phonemes, but I'd also be a jerk. The very phrase itself - ""political correctness"" - has a demand to it, almost an aspiration, to be better or to be constantly correct coupled with a sense of superiority that so many other people are incorrect. And once you've ""know"" you're correct, what is your new obligation? To correct everyone else.

Far better than being correct is being respectful, being considerate, being polite, and being willing to correct the inevitable mistakes you will make rather than trying to never, ever, no matter fucking what, ever make any mistakes. Å½iÅ¾ek's point is that being human is a messy experience that is saturated by a series of nexuses of influences and ideas, many of which are wonderfully enlightened and positive and many offensive and ugly, and that the ugly is going to get out sometimes despite our efforts. When the ugly gets out, what should we do? Simply apologize and acknowledge that you've done something wrong that might have offended others around you (acknowledging their Otherness as a full presence for yourself to them).

But trying to be correct all the time is repressive and damaging, perhaps even more so for the person trying to be correct rather than those being offended.

565,"I've never understood why this wasn't something very simple to resolve. Heidegger the human being was a total fucking piece of shit, undefendable because of his views of Jews and Judaism. Any part of his philosophy that is tainted by his being a fucking piece of shit - in particular his political philosophy, some of which is present in Sein und Zeit but which appears more pervasively in his later writings - needs to be called the product of a piece of shit and fully criticized for being shit. Some of Heidegger's philosophy is shit, and some of it is tainted by shit. 

That being said, some of it is remarkably insightful, beautifully written, and incredibly important. In particular, a Heideggerian position on environmental ethics, because of its potential non-anthropocentric perspective, is remarkably valuable. The difference is between the need to be critical up to and including vigorous and unrelenting condemnation of Heidegger while discovering the value in Heideggerian philosophy. 

I would argue that this is one of the problems of continental philosophy: the conflation of the personal with the genuinely philosophical. Being a Lacanian - it's own kettle of fish, which is definitely an understatement! - I fully realize that it seems hard to separate the man from his philosophy, but it's also easy to hold your nose when you smell shit, vomit and putrescence when you come across it.

610,"Back in 1988, when I was a first year undergraduate student, I was interrailing across Europe on my way to Istanbul. I had spent some time in Yugoslavia, and was taking the train from Belgrade to Thessaloniki. The trains, especially the overnight trains, were crowded, greasy and smoke filled, and altogether unpleasant experiences. Until she got on board. Don't know why, but this beautiful, young, Greek woman, one or two years older than me, spent the next 10 hours or so talking about everything with me. She laughed at my pronunciation of Greek â€” I was studying classical Greek then and she said I sounded like I was talking in a church â€”Â  and I got to talk about the United States and Scotland, where I was studying, and she told me about studying medicine in Belgrade and we both enjoyed complaining in English about the other people in the compartment and I think we actually fell in love a little bit. And then we got to Thessaloniki and she asked me to come stay with her in her parents' house for a few days, and that her parents weren't home for a whole week. And I said no. Because I wanted to go to Istanbul (and she asked why would I want to go there, and I didn't have answer, but I did fall in love with Istanbul over a week). And because it meant cheating on the girl back in England who would later become my ex-fiancÃ©e. And saying no was the hardest and most regretted thing I've ever done in my life, but I still said no because I was loyal to my girlfriend. I should have said yes. And I wish I hadn't forgotten her name, even if just to remember her beautiful face with a name I could whisper in my thoughts, while I enjoy my amazing, wonderful life with my beautiful wife and son.
