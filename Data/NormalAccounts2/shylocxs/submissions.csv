I've been a number of times and love it but this will be the first time with my son, whose food allergies are very, very serious. I know most Japanese food does not have peanuts and tree nuts in it, and Japanese chefs are apparently increasingly aware of food allergies, so my typical high level of watchfulness should be sufficient. But... we're staying with friends (who live in the Denenchofu area of Tokyo... I know, very nice, very upper class) for a few days and they are nervous. So, a couple of questions:

1) any restaurants (including chain restaurants) that you would recommend that have a high level of attention to food allergies and readily provide a list of their ingredients?

2) any bread manufacturers or snack companies that claim they are specifically peanut and tree nut free?

Answers to these two questions will help out with our plans.

Until recently she would gather the files together onto a DVD and run that on a DVD player or (this is what she actually does) on a built-in DVD player with autorun and autoloop features.

Why? Because she would like to have multiple, different video files run sequentially and she knows how to do that on a DVD.

But, buying a television without a built-in DVD is becoming harder (both more expensive and fewer models).

Can this be done off of a USB drive? Any recommendations for a specific brand that this would be easy to do it on?
