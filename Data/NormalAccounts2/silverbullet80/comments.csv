239,"My second year of school I went to an out of state school, and I had to get an apartment because there was no room in on campus housing for transfer students.  My school provided those of us with a list of other students in the same situation, so that we might get together and go in on a place to live.

So, I ended up doing just that with my roommate.  Things were great for like 2 years, then he started going downhill..  his grades were slipping, his girlfriend dumped him, and he didn't make the golf team..  poor guy.

About this time, he also stopped contributing around the apartment.. like cleaning dishes, taking out the trash, buying toilet paper, etc.  I finally decided to keep my own toilet paper stashed in my room in a locked cabinet.  Days went by, and no toilet paper showed up in the bathroom.  Days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into a little over a month.  One day, my girlfriend was over and she had to go to the bathroom.  She finished up, washed her hands, and then went to dry her hands on the towel hanging over the toilet when I heard her freak out.  The underside of the towel was covered in shit stains.. my roommate had been wiping his ass with the towel above the toilet and hanging it back up.  I have no idea how I never could smell it.

I ended up throwing the towel on his bed and leaving him a roll of toilet paper with a note that said ""I think you need this more than I do"".  We never spoke again after that, and then our lease was up soon after and we parted ways.",2015-09-18 22:32:49+00:00,cv6dm5c,1.0,t3_3lh1d3,9631.0,AskReddit

I just picked up an '01 Limited a few weeks ago, so I may not have had it long enough to give a credible answer, but I can answer your questions on my short experience.

1 - Yes, the V8 is reliable but has more power for similar gas mileage.  They do have a stronger drive train than the I-6's.

2 - The ride is great.  It's a little trucky when turning on bumpy roads, but typically very smooth the rest of the time.  

3 - Just double check that everything 'power' works..  seats, seat heaters (if you have them), door locks, windows, sunroof, etc.  ",2015-08-23 23:10:57+00:00,cudafpe,1.0,t3_3i4qia,1540.0,GrandCherokee

I just drove it and made sure everything worked, specifically the A/C (switch between hot and cold, fresh and recirculate, etc), the heated seats, and the windows.  The hood/lift gate/rear glass struts seem to always go bad unless they were replaced.  Also, check the front brakes for warped rotors (you'll be able to feel them pulsating when you drive)..  I ended up having to replace mine, and I upgraded to the newer style calipers while I was at it (cost about $250 total).  

As far as the Quadra drive goes, I think just turn the wheel sharp in a parking lot and listen to see if it makes funny noises.  I'm sure there could be other tests you could do.",2015-08-23 22:59:24+00:00,cuda0sa,1.0,t3_3i4qm3,799.0,GrandCherokee

The only casualty was the stock lug wrench.  On the drivers side, I got to the 5th lug nut and it was a little more snug than the rest and my wrench didn't like it.  It gave in and bent, ended up using a regular ratchet to get the rest of the job done.
