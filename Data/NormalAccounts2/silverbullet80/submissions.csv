It worked, however there was a problem with heat and the metal parts that were touching plastic parts got hot and melted the plastic parts.

The first one I got from AT&amp;T, and the speaker I listen through during phone calls died.  I took it to the retail store, they said they couldn't help me and to call warranty.  So they send me a replacement, and I have a problem with the same part, just a different problem.  Whenever I press the phone against my head or have the phone in a case, the sound coming from the speaker is messed up... crackling noises, and the volume goes way down.  When not in a case and not pressed against my head, it sounded fine.

Now I am on my third one, and while all the hardware seems to be working fine (knock on wood), I have a problem that still exists that I have noticed on the other two S7's.  Text messages I send sometimes don't go through, and sometimes I don't receive text messages.  Also, sometimes I take pictures and when I go look at the gallery for them, they don't show up in the gallery however when I am using the camera, that picture that's not in the gallery shows up in the little gallery ""thumbnail"" as if it were in the gallery.

So, so far NO good as far as I'm concerned with the S7.  I had lots of problems as well with my S4, which is what the S7 replaced.  I went through 3 or 4 S4's for screen problems, all replaced under warranty.

I have not gone back to AT&amp;T yet, but I don't know what to do.  Is it Samsung? Is it the S7? Is it AT&amp;T?

I really like the idea of nothing in the tank, so I like the sump because I can put the pump and heater in there, etc.  My only stumbling block is HOW to get the water from the tank to the sump.  I really didn't like the overflow box, because I was always afraid the syphon would break and my tank would overflow.  I want something I don't have to worry about.

I did have a canister filter at one point (Fluval 405) on my 55g, but I like the idea of a sump better.

I have a small office space that's part of a larger office building.  As part of the office rent, I get an internet connection, basically just a single cat6 line running to the office area.  

Up until now, I've had just a D-Link wireless router plugged into it, and all my connections have been wireless.  I've recently purchased a small 12-port hub, which I plugged directly into the line provided by the office building.  I plugged the wireless router into the hub, and all is good.  The wireless connection works fine, just as it did in the past.

My problem is when I connect a computer to the 12-port hub, I get an IP address in a different range (169.x.x.x) than what the wireless router gives out (192.x.x.x).  If I manually assign an IP that is in the 192.x.x.x range, it still doesn't work.  

The wireless router is also a hub, as it has 4 ports in the back, and if I plug the computer directly into one of those ports I can get an Internet connection just fine (while the wireless router is plugged into the 12-port hub).

Any ideas?  My goal is to have the 12-port hub, and then plug in the wireless router, a couple of PC's, and a couple of network printers possibly to the hub.

My house is a single family home, built on a slab and is about 1700 sq/ft total, build in the 80's.  The ducts are all flexible, with the HVAC unit in a small closet in the garage and the plenum goes up through the drywall into the attic.  The HVAC unit itself was replaced probably 6 or 7 years ago, as well as the outside unit.  It is a Carrier Comfort 80.

I have basically two issues:
1) no matter how much we clean, the house is dusty.  When I Google this, it points to leaky attic ducts as the culprit.  
2) when I hold my hand up to the vent, the force of the air coming out is comparable to someone barely exhaling on your hand.  I feel like there should be more air coming out.

To solve problem one, I've thought about simply replacing the ducts with new.  Right now, there are 6 ducts coming off of the plenum.  Two are smaller, maybe 6""?, and go about 6 feet directly to the vents (one is the foyer, the other is the laundry room).  The other 4 ducts are larger ducts, where they go and split off to 1 vent in a bedroom and the other vent in a bathroom for example. 

Could I reduce the number of ducts coming off the plenum, and just have more ""Y's"" further down?

For instance, we have three bedrooms and two bathrooms.  Could I not run one large duct off the plenum for all of these vents, and then just reduce the ducts as they split off for each vent?

And as far as the amount of air coming out of the ducts, I'm not sure there is anything I can do short of replacing the unit.  ",HVAC,Homeowner looking for advice on HVAC,https://www.reddit.com/r/HVAC/comments/3qvbzd/homeowner_looking_for_advice_on_hvac/

They were plugged into the same circuit, and the breaker didn't like that.  

What causes this?  And is there anything I can do to fix it for the future?

I just replaced my front brakes, went with the Akebono's and new rotors/pads.  They had been great, until this morning I pulled out of my driveway to go to the gym and now there is a ""creaking"" sound that happens when the wheels are rolling.  I thought it was coming from the drivers side but my wife thinks it's coming from the passenger side.  When I hit the brakes to stop, the noise stops.. but it comes back once I start driving.  As I get faster, the creaking gets faster...

Any ideas?   Thanks in advance!",GrandCherokee,Brakes seem to be making a noise now,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrandCherokee/comments/3ilv3w/brakes_seem_to_be_making_a_noise_now/

It's probably a moot point what the largest size tire is I can fit, as I'm only planning on going with a 3"" lift for now (maybe larger way down the road). ",GrandCherokee,Tire size on stock rims,http://www.reddit.com/r/GrandCherokee/comments/3hbvpk/tire_size_on_stock_rims/

I've been really eyeing a truck, either crew cab (preferably) or an extended cab.  I drive 95% of the time by myself, but I have a family that would occasionally be with me. 

The truck will be used primarily for regular driving around town, but I do construction work for fun so it will be used sometimes to haul supplies and tools.  Also, would like to be able to haul a boat or camper at some point.  My budget is $15,000 max, would like to stay closer to $10k.  My mechanical ability is pretty high, I've done a lot of other automotive related work in the past.

I would love a diesel because I love the sound and I love turbos, however I realize diesels are going to be out of my price range and maintenance is high, as well as probably more truck than I need.

I'm not particularly attached to any brand, so I'm open to any of them.  My dilemma is that I don't know which engines are reliable, and in my budget range most trucks will be over 100k miles (I'm wanting to stay 2004 and newer).  4x4 is a must unless you can convince me otherwise.

I have one friend that swears by the Chevy Vortec and one that swears by Toyota's.  How does the Ford Triton motor compare?  I've seen some decent looking F-150's in my price range, but I nothing about their motors.
