Last year someone posted a picture that was taken east of Issaquah and it showed a long country lane with a white fence and it was lined with trees that were all different colors of Red and yellow. In the comments section it seemed fairly well known so I was hoping someone could tell me where it was so I could head out and see it in person.

I got to the stop in pioneer square and it said the next train was arriving in one minute.  Three minutes later the train had not arrived and now said the next one was in 6 minutes so I took an Uber to Capitol Hill to watch the game.  After the game I decided to give it another try at pike and Broadway.  Same thing,  said the train was arriving then switched to 11 minutes.  What have the been testing for the past few months?",Seattle,Arrival time for first hill streetcar is terrible,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/42ijz6/arrival_time_for_first_hill_streetcar_is_terrible/
