34,"What you wrote made me think. You weren't wanting to find love because you had already had it. Because you are still together we can infer the two of them have worked to continue the relationship and not simply drifted apart.  So why are humans compelled to work hard and succeed? OP says young men do it for sex and reputation. I think Fear Of Missing Out plays a bigger part in motivating all of society in regards to emotions and experiences.  Imagine you were a tribesman, growing up in your village you learned all about the hunting that the men would do, you would see and taste the big game they brought back, and hear the exhilarating stories of the chase, the men talking back and forth of how the mighty weapons they crafted worked so flawlessly.
Now how would you feel to be shackled up in the shed where they kept their spears, kept out of the group which you could hear or see celebrating their catch, being lauded by the women and children who dance and sing for them. You would think to yourself, ""I can do that! I can make a spear and I can chase the game just as well as any man, but they keep me here?!"" You might start to resent the other men as you notice their flaws; the way they anger at their family or carelessly toss their spear into the shed. You might think, ""Will I ever get to show them how I can do it? Will anyone ever dance and sing for me after a long and hard day's hunt?"" Money is nothing more than a tool. You can use it unwisely and diminish it's usefulness.  Or you can keep your tools sharp and keep many of them to do different things.  Not having tools or a way to get them makes it hard to much done. No way to prove to yourself or others your true ability and actualize your full potential. By working and manipulating our environment, our relationships, and our possessions effectively we self-actualize. So shelter, food, and belonging (within the tribe, changing it or making our own) are what we seek. Where there comes a time that I need to make a change, I can be sure (security) I will have the support of my house, my family, myself, and my tools to go and make that change. I think boys like tools because they make ideas a reality, they can compete, they can be unhindered.

86,"Combusting plant matter with energy from the very same star it relied upon as a sprout - the same flame it seeks to smother... But just about every lifeform in the Universe is planet-bound to it's homeworld in it's stellar system - whether it's in orbit or adrift. Do you think life could survive in the chaos of asteroid fields? Surely some race of advanced intelligence and space navigation capabilities will ultimately have origins in twilight debris fields, what will they look like? If they are smart enough to endure the rigors of time and interstellar travel, their tech will likely have surpassed. Maybe we'll find that that's just what life boils down to. Our tech however...

I feel like if anything is for certain, it's that we're all ""in"" the Space Age together - we always have been we find - so I hope you've got your suit ready to go, we are already adrift in time and space. We could have repaired the systems, until the attacks started and by then it was too late. Humanity had their chances, lots if you count them, but I'm way too tired to keep typing this bullshit :)",2015-07-08 07:16:12+00:00,csvyl5z,1.0,t3_3chxcy,21475.0,trees

90,"Hi, I'm a returning undergraduate, last semester for ITM major, Psych minor - prior CS major (2 yrs.)

So, IIT's School of Applied Technology ITM Courses in Management, Development, Security, Organization, Topics, etc. Courses often reflect CS structure with less math and credits transfer well between CS.
If you're interested, definitely get a hold of an advisor like Ray or Bob.

Pros: Most professors have industry experience,
Legendary Student Advisors, Professors, Inventors,
Accepts many transfers, credits, ""electives""
IIT's Interprofessional Projects Program (IPRO) 
Career Fairs, Campus Jobs through Career Management Center,
ITMO the ITM Organisation is run by students and hold events, etc. very well, often

I enjoy the campus, mostly easy to get around, while school and living can be costly, it's surely worth it in the end
Hope you enjoy iit",2015-06-24 05:01:51+00:00,csgrjlw,1.0,t3_39hpb8,1069102.0,IIT
