Opened a bottle I had brought to work, and strangely found soylent liquid being squeezed up from under the plastic ""label"" wrap as I gripped the bottle. I drank it, but couldn't figure out how or why there was liquid ""under"" the wrapper.  Tonight I go to twist off the cap and the top of the bottle comes with it!  There's another bottle in my box with obvious signs of leakage and spoilage (black specks seen through the label).  I'm about to contact Soylent, but thought I'd check here first and let you all know - don't want anyone getting sick.",soylent,Cracked bottles!
