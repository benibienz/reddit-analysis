We live in a melting pot. Universities and public/private employers (mostly) seek diversity in their employees.   

If you work hard enough you go to prestigious universities and work for very highly rated employers where your peers, teachers, teaching assistants, bosses, colleagues and customers are not all fluent English speakers. Think about this for a second. You go to Harvard, Stanford, MIT, etc. You work at Google, Apple, Goldman Sachs, etc. Many of the people you interact with are not going to speak perfect English and yet they are employed just like you.

If you want to succeed in life, you have to look past this and put in the effort. You certainly do not dismiss someone entirely just because they aren't perfect English speakers. If you do that, then you literally don't learn math with no one to blame for yourself.

47,"At around age 7, I got a wood splinter in the base of the palm of my hand near my wrist, but still in the fleshy/fatty part of my palm. I was playing near a wooden stool with unfinished legs. I tripped and grabbed onto the stool and got my splinter!  
My parents tried to extract it with tweezers and a sewing needle, but we couldn't get it out. They said it would come out on its own eventually. It hurt me for a day and then I forgot about it except for a little bump of tough skin that formed over the puncture wound. I always used to bend my ring finger down and rub the bump. I did this for 20 years!  
In my 27th year, I scuffed up my hand at this spot while moving some heavy furniture. My skin burst (very minor) and out popped what I can only describe as a little cyst ball with the wood splinter in side. My hand healed completely and quickly.  
I frequently and subconsciously bend my ring finger down to rub the bump even 5 years later. At first I feel the bump, and then I become consciously alerted when I don't feel the bump any more.  I imagine this is similar but much less extreme than phantom limb syndrome that amputees experience.

Web pass currently (previously?) has two criteria which it uses to initially screen out customers:  
 1) Building must have more than 10 units  
 2) Building must have been built after 1995  
 
If you believe that your building has ""modern"" wiring i.e., the type of wiring often seen in buildings after 1995 (not sure what exactly that means), despite having been built before 1995, then you can call them up and ask them to check it out.  

The majority of Webpass' setup requires line-of-sight radio transmission. They must be able to put a directional antenna on your building and point it directly at another antenna to complete the link.   

Webpass has stated that they are interested in or maybe have already begun providing connectivity via physical line (fiber) to buildings.  

You can always go to their website and see how far you can get into the screening and enrollment process.

No one is saying that Webpass was not competition. 

&gt; nobody else in those markets will have gigabit 

This is not accurate. In Chicago alone, there are at least 4 competitors that I can name off the top of my head that provide gigabit service: SilverIP, EverywhereWireless, Comcast and AT&amp;T. RCN will be providing it in late 2016 or late 2017. 

I'm sure there are more providers of gigabit service in at least some of Webpass' existing markets. Quick searches in Boston and Miami revealed some offerings. 

Further, Webpass is only a suitable solution for modern, multi-unit buildings since the majority of it's deployment requires line-of-sight radio transmission. Currently, they will not deploy in buildings built before 1995 or with fewer than 10 units.

87,"This statement is absurd.  ITT parents and parents-to-be who do not intend to teach their children about responsible finance.  

My parents opened a number of credit lines in my name at a very young age and never used their credit irresponsibly. Originally, they opened an amex platinum credit in my name due to the benefit of private ambulance flight if injured. We traveled a lot and we had two scares. 

My parents taught me about debt, saving, investing and spending power at a very young age.     

I graduated from college debt-free because I worked hard in HS and chose a ""free"" school vs an expensive school. In the first few years where I was full-time in the workforce, I saved 40-70% of my income. At 27 my credit score eclipsed 800, but was very very high before that.  
 
Thanks to my parents, I have been able to save money for my future, purchase a home, purchase a car and have qualified for countless other benefits and debt instruments at lower cost.

106,"I understand your point, but it's not the same logic and here are both my arguments:    
1) You're talking about a rebate after the fact on a tax increase.    
2) You're talking about a rebate that is:  
   
    a) max $200   
    b) min $25  
    c) average below $200  
  versus an increase of $400 ***on the average homeowner*** NOT an average increase of $400. &lt;--- this is such a key point. It's *really* deceptive and tricky wording to make the increase sound like it's a lot less than it really is.   
   
      a) Roughly, a home valued at $150-200k will have a tax bill of roughly $3k, which a 13% increase coming out to $400. (Back of the napkin math).
      b) Chicago has a median home value of $196,000, meaning half of the homes below and half above that value. (Source: [Zillow](http://www.zillow.com/research/local-market-reports/))  
     c) We know that tax increases are exempt on:  
         i) home values less than $150,000 from previous tribune articles (Will look for the article later this afternoon. Can't find it with a quick search, but I very clearly remember this #.)   
         ii) Rebates eligible only to households with incomes &lt; 4x poverty (16k for family of 2) so 64k? 
         iii) Rebates eligible to households with&lt;=  $100k income
         iv) MEDIAN household income in Chicago is $61,598. Again, half below and half above. 
       

So, we can make a very educated conclusion that:  
1) by ""average homeowner,"" Rahm et al mean the ppl with median home value of roughly $196,000  
2) at least 50% of households will be eligible for a rebate based upon median income, 4x poverty and 100k figures   
3) many homes will be exempt from tax increase based upon home value alone  
4) the average tax increase on those that actually get a tax increase is going to be much much higher than $400  
5) the 13% tax increase is going to be disproportionately (I'm not necessarily saying unfairly) a burden on the shoulders of those owning homes in excess of $196,000.     

Is it even possible that many homes not only see no tax increase but also become eligible for rebates?

111,"&gt; Apple isn't involved at all. Like, literally no involvement in any capacity.   
&gt; not involved in the actual credit/debit transaction process

How is Apple i.e. the iPhone (hardware and software designed by Apple including the SE) not involved in the transaction when the device 1) enrolls the card 2) at point/time of sale sends the token along with 3) dynamically, real-time generated cryptogram including dynamic CVV comprised of transactional data taken from the merchant such as merchant ID, price and likely other data? 

I'm guessing this is semantics now based upon whether you're arguing that:  
1) Apple in this case is not the iPhone, their hardware, software and on-device security implementation (I disagree)  
2) and that Apple is not a server/service existing on the payment network/payment flow (I agree)

Regardless, you're supporting my prior point that the way they implemented Apple Pay reduces (eliminates?) their risk while still skimming $ (uncertain whether it is % and/or fixed $) off of transaction value.  

And my additional point was *perhaps* Apple will implement/enable a P2P payment capability using iMessages as a UI in such a way that they reduce or eliminate their risk in the same spirit as their implementation of Apple Pay.

112,"Apple is an intermediary in credit card purchases right now with Apple Pay. Depending on how Apple implements P2P payments e.g. tokenization with CCs, they may be able to keep the responsibility of KYC and AML on sending and receiving institutions. Apple doesn't have the responsibility of preventing you from using Apple Pay to buy child pornography, illegal arms or even providing funds to terrorists. That responsibility is still on the merchant, merchant acquirer, issuing bank and association. Apple also doesn't have the responsibility of preventing someone from fraudulently loading an unauthorized CC onto their device. Fraudulent enrollment is the responsibility of the issuing bank.

But you're right, Apple might not provided iMessages for Android and they might not go any further into payments of any type. ",2016-06-10 16:38:37+00:00,d43tao4,4.0,t1_d43mmeb,9343.0,apple

However, the last three years, she has received pre-check regardless of whether I book the flight or she books it (she used some of her points to pay for our last trip). We both had pre-check on our boarding pass even though I am the only one who signed up for pre-check.

213,"I am seeking a somewhat durable, water resistant, wind resistant, warmer pant for winter that goes with my current winter jacket lineup (jackets linked below). I live in Chicago.   

**Use Cases:**   
* Walking on the sidewalk while it is cold, windy, snowing or raining out  
* Clearing snow off of my car or doing light snow shoveling

**Requirements:**  
* Somewhat water resistant, water proof or impermeable. I don't spend a ton of time outside in extreme conditions. I don't need plastic pants or something that is *extremely* water proof, or over engineered for my urban lifestyle. But I do want something that doesn't soak thru when inevitably some snow gets on my pants and melts.
* Somewhat warm. My body runs hot and I sweat a lot. I don't need super thick, tundra-rated pants but I obviously need something better than summer weight, super breathable fabric.   
* Something that looks good, maybe somewhat modern/rustic and doesn't necessarily looking like hiking, skiing, trekking, outdoor pants. I'm not trying to look like a snowshoe-ist, skier, lumberjack, or mountain climber.     
* Goes with my current lineup of winter jackets  
* Solid construction and will last me a while in terms of styling and quality  
* Not insanely expensive (I'm not looking to spend $300 on pants)    
* Can be dressed up or down slightly i.e., looks good with color 8 shell cordovan boots, or a nice quilted snow/winter shoe or brogued dressier shoe.  

**Current winter jacket lineup:**

3. Leave it in the fridge for 2-3 days.   
4. Day of cooking/eating, rice from fridge will be hard and clumpy.     
5. Wet your hands and break down the clumps into mostly individual grains. Having wet hands is key so the rice doesn't stick to your hands. Continue to wet your hands as necessary. Don't worry the added moisture to your hands won't undo the drying the process.

Edit: You will worry that the rice is far too dry at this point. Don't worry, the added soy, oyster, sesame or whatever other sauces you add will hydrate it sufficiently.

Service was solid i.e., direct us around the menu when we tell you we want to order 14 things, keep water glasses full, ask if we want more cocktails when those are empty, bring food but otherwise stay away so we can talk.

You requested a coffee table, but having gone down the paths of coffee table and ottoman before, I suggest going with an ottoman. Get a nice tray(s) that are proportional to the ottoman upon which to put drinks, decorations, remotes, etc.
