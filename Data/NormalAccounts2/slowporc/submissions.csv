I would like to basically find 3-5 pairs (enough to get me thru 4-5 days on-site at a client) of higher quality slacks that are as versatile as possible:   
1) I can dress them down or up a bit with a blazer but almost always will be worn primarily with a nice button-down shirt  
2) Safer colors/patterns e.g., not giant purple houndstooth pattern  
3) Fabrics that either appear to be or are slightly heavier or have some texture since I will be traveling to colder climates e.g., not linen or very thin/light cotton.  I'm thinking probably wool tweed.   
4) Preferably something that wears and travels decently. I don't want to be a mess of wrinkles the second I sit down or get out of a car. But I also do not necessarily need pants that are treated with a chemical that guarantees no wrinkling.  
5) I'm fine with self-laundering or dry cleaning options

An exterior portion of a home wall is damaged and is causing flooding in the house. The home wall is up against or very close to the property line. The exterior wall needs to be repaired. The only way to get access to the exterior wall is to go into the neighbor's yard either through the gate or jumping the wall/fence/gate.  

The neighbor is an absolutely horrible person. The neighbor is refusing that anyone, the property owner, insurance or repair people access the exterior wall via her yard. The neighbor even went so far as to provide a written direction to the police that anyone trying to get access to the wall through her property should be arrested.   

The HOA refuses to intervene even though the HOA documents detail that  
1) there is an easement  
2) neighbor must provide access with prior notification.  

Notification has been provided in the past via: 1) registered mail 2) HOA has called to notify the neighbor.  Still the neighbor refuses access.  

The police say they will not do anything since it is an HOA easement and not some municipal/county/state easement/access right.   

What can be done?  

We are not sure how to find the local/county/state easement right/law that provides the owner with access to the wall from the neighbor's yard. Surely this must exist. If such a right/law/code exists, can the police enforce it? Are the police obligated to enforce it?

The damaged wall is being covered by residential insurance. Can I expect the insurance agency to take legal action against the neighbor? Every day that passes, more damage is occurring to the house and foundation, which is increasing the cost of repairs that the insurance agency will have to cover.

Is the only option to sue the neighbor? This is for a very low-income home owner with a damaged wall who simply cannot afford large legal fees. Can these legal fees be recouped from the neighbor? Is this a type of situation where someone might do it pro-bono?

Appreciate any guidance on who to contact or what to do next.   

Edit: added a few details

Edit: See this really crappy drawing I did. The owner has to enter the neighbor's back yard in order to get access to the damaged section of the exterior wall.

For all the poo-pooers, no we're not going to make an investment just because strangers on the Internet say so. This is a crowdsourcing exercise to get a range of ideas for a possible lifestyle choice in FIRE.

Let's say you're planning on FIRE in about 18-20 years around the age of 50-52 with single digit millions in assets. Part of your plan is to spend significant time outside of the USA in a second home in addition to foreign and domestic USA travel. You'd like to buy a second home, probably outside of the USA, at some point in the future leading up to that FIRE date. You will probably rent it out to help cover some costs in the meantime, and you will probably vacation there annually to take advantage of your investment. 

Part of the difficulty of this crowdsourcing exercise is making assumptions and predictions about another locale 18-20 years in the future.

Other requirements:  
1. Reasonably short flight from most major USA airports like MIA, ATL, ORD, etc. I'm saying we don't want a 15 hour flight to Hong Kong, Bangkok, Buenos Aires, Santiago, etc.   
2. Warm climate - tropical preferably  
3. The city is and will continue to be OR will likely become an intriguing destination that has some elements of culture, food, activities, etc. We're not looking for isolated island or a bustling metropolis, but would consider something like an island that has some other stuff going on.   
4. Home prices are currently and you forecast to be low-to-medium over the next 5-10 years, which is when we will likely make the investment.   
5. Currently does not have and hopefully will not have an incredibly expensive cost of living in the future e.g., St. Barth's, St Martin, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Singapore, Paris, London, etc.  
6. Provides for some amount of active lifestyle i.e., not climbing super tall mountains but not also just a dessert island.   

So, I know people will say, what does low-to-medium housing cost mean to me, etc. I'm leaving this intentionally vague to try to get a range of ideas. It's a challenging exercise to predict the future! 

Also, for people that say, why not retire on X&lt;1MM rather than several MM:  
1. We enjoy our jobs for the time being. Maybe this will not always be the case, but this is the plan for now.    
2. We save a very large % of our income.  
3. We want to continue to work to demonstrate work ethic and contribution to society to our children.  
4. We currently do and continue to do a nice job of balancing work and life.  
5. We're planning on FIRE roughly around when kid(s) go to college.

1. I wish to make beef/lamb shawarma by alternating cuts of each animal on skewers on a smoker. What are the preferred cuts of meat? 

2. I want to ensure the cuts are very tender. With my chicken shawarma, which I believe I have nearly perfected for my personal tastes, I can count on juice of a lemon + my spices below to tenderize about 3lbs of chicken thighs very nicely. Can I count on similar ratio of lemon juice and beef/lamb to result in very tender meat?  
3. Below are the spices I use for my awesome chicken shawarma. Should I omit any spices or am I missing any spices for a beef/lamb variety? 
 *  Garlic clove
 *  Coriander
 *  Cumin
 *  Cardamom
 *  Cayenne pepper
 *  Smoke Paprika
 *  All Spice
 *  Turmeric
 *  Cinnamon
 *  Salt + Pepper
 *  Lemon juice
 *  Olive oil  

4. As mentioned above, I will cook on a big green egg (without any additional smoking woods aside from charcoal) with direct heat. I get fantastic results cooking chicken thighs tightly skewered together direct at 350 dome temperature for 10 minutes per side. Any suggestions on aiming higher/lower on temp and/or time for beef/lamb?

&gt; Malt crust: The house-made pizza dough contains a heavy dose of dark-roasted brewer's malt that gives the crust a darker appearance and a taste that's nuttier and slightly sweeter than others. There's also a unique Quad-City spice mix that makes its way into the dough.

**Another Quad-Cities style breakdown without recipe**

&gt; The dough It must contain a “spice mix” that is heavy on malt, which lends a toasted, nutty flavor, and it must be hand-thrown to be stretched into an even quarter-inch thin crust with a slight lip ringing the edge.
