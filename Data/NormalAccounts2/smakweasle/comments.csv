You've screwed with the timelines enough that you can utilize this current batch of characters in a fun way and continue the ""each movie in a new decade"" theme.

95,"**Amanda Knox** The Netflix documentary that just came out. I somehow avoided the whole story as it happened and didn't know anything about it before going in which was nice. The establishing shots are gorgeous, the story is solid. I'm not sure it did her good, in fact, I feel it made her look guilty but I enjoyed watching it. 

**Now You See Me 2** couldn't even finish it. I really enjoyed the first one as just a schlocky fun heist flick with a little bit of a different take. This was just painful to watch. The new female lead felt like the writers saying ""eh fuck it. We have money to burn.""

**The Jungle Book** I'm not a big nostalgia guy so those tricks don't work but this movie was entertaining. The cast was great and the visuals were truly amazing. 

**The Shallows** Blake Lively is easy on the eyes so I was able to finish this. She did the best anyone could with such a ridiculous plot. It would probably be fun to watch with a group of friends and some beers. 

**Money Monster** I'm sure they thought they were making some scathing takedown of the people on Wall Street but really it was just a heartless semi-thriller that had a lot of tonal issues. Clooney is charming enough to hold it together but this could've been great, instead we got serviceable. 

**It** each October I try and watch a bunch of horror movies as I'm sure most people do. This one did not have the scares I remember from when it originally aired. Clocking in at fourteen hours long didn't help it either /s

**Fire In The Sky** I saw this movie in the theater with my older brother and father in the theater. It terrified me then. It still sends chills down my spine 20+ years later. For whatever reason it's the only movie I've seen that truly scares me to my core. 

**Friday The 13th** a classic horror flick that knows its audience and doesn't try to be more than that. 

**Ex Machina** somehow missed out on this when it came out. Search any movie thread and someone is talking about how good it was. This one actually lives up that hype. I loved it. 

**It Follows** its not bad. Reminded me of the classic 80s horror movies that have come before it. Good story and a believable cast.

152,"Almost Holy original score by Atticus Ross, Leopold Ross and Bobby Krlick. 

This is the limited edition release that features an original slip covert that's secured with a golden lacquer  seal. This is either #12 or #72 of 250.  The first number is a little suspect, so I'm not sure. 

The movie is a documentary about a priest who takes homeless children and sets them on a decent path. 

[Here's the trailer](https://youtu.be/t-uBjW9hhxc) I haven't seen the movie yet, but I've heard good things. I picked up the score because of my love for all things Atticus.

171,"**Dear Zachary: A Letter To A Son About His Father (2008)** - Amazing documentary. I was warned that it would ruin my day, but didn't heed the advice. Forty minutes in, I felt it was a standard doc but enjoyable to hear everyone's take on the Guy who the story is about. But then there's a punch in the gut and the rest of the movie left me with my jaw on the floor. Heartbreaking story but I would highly recommend it. 

**The Brothers Grimsby (2016)** - After watching a really heavy doc I wanted to watch something I didn't have to think about, at all. I love Ali G so I gave Cohen's newest a chance. It's not very good but the ""big shocking scene"" that everyone talks about made me laugh pretty hard. It had it's moments but if you never saw it you're not missing much. 

**Room (2016)** - This is probably the best movie I've seen this year. I know it was big around award season but it slipped passed me. I was lucky enough to go in without any information. I didn't know the story, I didn't see any previews so I wasn't able to piece together what was going to happen. It was a great experience. 

**Triple 9 (2016)** Dreadfully boring. Based on the previews and the cast I was sold but this movie did it's best to waste them in every scene. 

**Whiskey Tango Foxtrot (2016)** - I could barely pay attention to this movie. Lifeless is the best way to describe it. I hit pause at one point just to see how much time was left and realized I still had over 40 minutes to go and turned it off. ",2016-09-05 19:51:15+00:00,d7alxpf,1.0,t3_519c4u,24091.0,flicks

NIN announced their tour and this was the last stop on it. At the time they were saying it would be their final show (that later turned out to be untrue.) As a diehard fan I gathered up some money, camping supplies and friends and went down. I kinda wished the days away waiting for this set but it was sitting there, in the mud waiting for them to take the stage while Bruce Springsteen was doing his thing over on What that I realized Bonnaroo was something special. I talked with random people (something I never really did back then) and met some awesome fans. We shared fun stories about the band we all loved and then finally, NIN came on the stage, melted our brains with an amazing set list. 

They ended the set with Hurt like they typically do, but it was the song before that; ""The Day The World Went Away"" that caused me to break down.

Step 1: Wash it daily (I use head &amp; shoulders cause it's scent free and cheaper than standard beard wash, which I've found doesn't work for me.) 

step 2: post shower I comb out any snags

Step 3: oil time. I've tried a handful and they work well but I hate strong scents so I found an unscented one through this sub. It's made by [Genesee Beard Co](https://www.geneseebeardco.com/collections/beard-oil/products/natural-beard-oil) and I would strongly recommend it (as I've done many times before.) they also have one (CitraMint) that isn't overpowering that I break out for special occasions.

Step 4: comb oil throughout beard and while starting to shape it and make it lay how I want. This is also a good time to remove any nagging snags/knots

Step 5: brush beard (I find this helps bring out the shimmer and tames any wild hairs.)

Step 6: mustache wax time because I'm tired of eating my mustache with any meal.

303,"I was in the football stadium scene for The Dark Knight Rises. As a lifelong Batman fan, it was a blast. We drove about six hours to get there, parked, rode the shuttle to the stadium and got seated in the stadium. On our way in we were all handed yellow towels to wave and as the section filled up we rehearsed the National Anthem about a dozen times with the kid who was singing it on the PA. Then they filmed it a couple times (having all of us/the teams face in different directions each time.) The stadium was only about a quarter full, we basically filled every other row of one corner the result of the full stadium in the movie is digital. That whole process lasted about five hours then they moved us all to the end zone seats and took a long break. Food was standard stadium food that was provided for free (burgers/dogs/chips/soda.) During the break most of the crew left the field and the technicians set up something like seventy mounds of dirt that were rigged to explode. As we all ate lunch they showed us the first teaser for the film (super cool!) and brought out the three camouflaged tumblers. The place went nuts because those vehicles were so loud and Hinez Ward was riding on the roof of one.

They spent the next couple hours having us do reactions to fake explosions and creating general ""oh god a stadium just exploded"" panic look while filming the crowd. Then they triggered all the actual explosions and taped some more. 

After that came Bane doing his speech. It was amazing. It was the first real look anyone had at the new Bane. We saw a fuzzy shot of him in the teaser but this was him, standing huge. You could hear his lines (though there were definitely different in the theatrical version, in fact his entire voice was different, less fragile sounding in the theatrical cut.) They did his entrance and speech a few times though his mic ""cut out"" whenever he mentioned who he talked to. 

They were crazy about spoilers getting out, I saw them kick out several people for sneaking photos with their phones. 

Overall, it was an amazingly fun experience. We didn't get to meet anyone but we got to see Nolan and Tom Hardy working, plus the Pittsburgh Steelers were the players for the two teams playing so they all hung out. They did a TON of giveaways/raffles that were all free. Everything from movie props to comics to gift cards. At the end of the day Tom Hardy did the final raffle with Christopher Nolan. That was for a new car. The two of them also gave a nice speech thanking everyone for spending the day there. 

I think the worst of it all was that it was a particularly hot day in August and they asked that everyone wear black/yellow and dress for winter. That didn't seem so bad until we go there and realized it was balls hot and a winter coat sucks.

323,"**Jason Bourne** I thought it was a fun addition to the franchise. The original set is one of my favorite trilogies. This wasn't quite up to par with the originals but it was better than the fourth and the car chase at the end was so over-the-top fun that I didn't really care about the inconsistencies. Overall it was a fun way to spend a Wednesday morning at the theater. 

**Suicide Squad** I haven't hated a movie this much in a long time. I've never gone out of my way to talk someone into not seeing a movie but I feel it necessary to shout from the rooftops that I hated this thing. The pacing, the darkness, the acting, whatever it was that Leto was doing  I hated it all. It's a complete disrespect for the source material and I'm tired of it. As a lifelong DC comics reader I am fed up with how they handle these movies. I wasn't the biggest BvS fan but that had some redeemable qualities. After this thing I'm done with their universe. I won't see WW or JL. I can't rightfully give my money to them anymore. 

**Star Trek Beyond** I haven't loved these new ones either but the lady wanted to see it and I really like Idris Elba. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. It was the best of the three IMO. Even with all the crap I give these movies the one thing I have to say is that the casting is spot on. They nail their rolls. It was a fun flick and well worth the price of admission. 

**Keanu** I only know Key &amp; Peele from a few of their more popular bits but I rented this hoping it would make me laugh and it boy did it ever. I laughed pretty much the entire time. The concept is the perfect mix of absurd and funny without going to completely ridiculous. It works because everyone commits to the concept and Their natural charm helps you get past how ridiculous the idea is. It reminded me of Pineapple Express (which I also enjoy.) I can't wait to check out their show now. 

**Batman: The Killing Joke** based on the outstanding Alan Moore comic this is their animated adaptation. While I wasn't crazy with how they handled Batgirl and the prologue in general it did not detract enough for me to enjoy the whole product. Once the movie catches up to where the book starts its excellent. Hearing Hamil read those lines was awesome. Conroy handles Batman (as always.) seeing some of those more iconic shots were really cool. I know it's received plenty of bad press but I really enjoyed it.

364,"**1000 Homo DJs- Supernaut** (45rpm single): NIN is the band that got me obsessed with anything noisy. This was a track that Trent Reznor did with Al Jorgensen of Ministry. It's a cover of the Black Sabbath song and there was some label issues that caused them to ""remove"" Reznor from the track. This version appears to not be edited and is clearly the original recording (I didn't even know it existed on vinyl until today.) Very excited to add it to my collection.
  
**Beck - Mellow Gold**: I love Beck. Have loved him ever since Loser broke big back in the mid-90s and have been following his career ever since. Unfortunately I haven't been able to find much on wax for him so I was really excited to get this today. Personal Highlight of the album has always been ""Mutherfuker."" 

**Brand New - The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me**: I know this sub loves this band. I never really got into them until I heard this album. Particularly the track ""Limosuine.""  I will argue til the day I die that it is one of the greatest songs of the 00's. 

**El Vy - Return To The Moon**: The National is one of my guilty pleasure bands. I love the singers voice and lyrics. This is his side project and it's just fun stuff. 

**Bob Mould - Beauty &amp; Ruin**: Hüsker Dü is another one of those ultra important bands that helped shaped what I enjoy. I didn't realize Bob Mould had been doing some solo stuff over the last few years but holy shit am I happy about it. This album rules!

I would've preferred if they cut out the Luthor/WW/Meta Humans/Doomsday story and focused on a world turning on Superman. A world that isn't sure how to handle him. Some see him as the savior others as a man with too much power and no way to control him. Batman is pissed (that opening sequence of him driving through Man of Steel was excellent) and decides to take it into his own hands. Then at the end after they decide they can work together, instead of killing eachother, have them stumble on Lex gathering all the info on the superheros for whatever reason Lex would be gathering this information.

1. Hum - ""You'd Prefer An Astronaut"" on half black/half white vinyl. This album is one of my favorites from back in the day. It's also one a close friend and I have always bonded over. You'd probably recognize the single ""Stars"" but everything on this record was perfect. 
2. The Claypool Lennon Delirium - ""Monolith of Phobos"" on gold vinyl. Super fun project by the bass master and Sean Lennon. Can't wait to see them in a couple weeks (for free!!)
3. Chvrches - ""Every Open Eye"" on coke bottle clear vinyl and ""The Bones Of What You Believe."" I didn't know much about this band but I've seen them twice live at Bonnaroo (2014 &amp; 2016) and they're incredible live. I've fallen in love. Plus it's the closest I'll ever get to getting new Jakalope music. 
4. Gorillaz - ""Gorillaz"" on black wax. What do I have to say. If you're of my generation (early thirties) you sang the shit out of Clint Eastwood and loved everything they did. 
5. Rubble Kings soundtrack on marbled black vinyl. I recently watched the documentary on Netflix and really enjoyed it. I never buy soundtracks but this one has Run The Jewels so I couldn't help myself.

You're right, Bush did have a ton of support but that support quickly deteriorated and they're still blaming him for everything that happened. 

When I say there was a greater sense of duty, people looked to the military in those days as something that was more than just a last resort job. Watch those guys from the 101st talk about when they heard about the war starting. Their first reaction was to join the military. I didn't see that among my peers (I was a HS senior when it happened.) I see my generation and those that followed as more entitled and of the ""what's in it for me?"" mindset. Back then it didn't seem that way.

I went in order until I realized they never had a proper release for Catch Without Arms. Late last year, my dreams came true and they announced they would do a special limited press for the album's tenth anniversary. I ordered this back in November and today it finally arrived. Now I can sit it where it belongs. 

This is the only band that I've been able to purchase every piece of wax they've released. 

I should've been smarter and purchased two copies of Catch like I did with El Cielo, as those buggers sell for ridiculous amounts now.

I purchased the [Beard Monster](https://monsterbeardcare.com/collections/gift-sets)  I was not terribly happy with their service but the products seem to be working well. I'm in the market for something unscented as I don't like a lot of the ""traditional man scent"" options. 

As far as routine, I wash it daily followed by a nice combing to untangle any little bits. After combing I apply a dime-sized dab of oil throughout the beard [Like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o6PcAtsixA) once the oil is distributed throughout I finish off with a quick brushing to lay all the bits flat and give it the shape I want. 

For the first six-ish months I was tripping my mustache every week. I'm in the process of trying to grow that out (it's different, I've never let it get this long over my lip.)

There have been zero trims to the beard itself though.

The albums are:

Ministry's ""Land of Rape and Honey"" which apparently is limited to 1500 and is on ""super 200g wax.""  

Pink Floyd ""The Wall"" I've been wanting this feller for a long time but couldn't afford an original pressing. Went with this new reissue which has all the original artwork. 

Guns 'N Roses ""Appetite for Destruction"" 

Sigur Ros ""agaetis byrjun"" which is one of my favorites but the packaging is really disappointing and both albums are stuffed into the same opening. I was hoping for a dual gatefold or some more artwork. 

Royal Blood great new record. Saw them this year at Bonnaroo, they were incredible live...been hooked ever since.

1836,"I didn't read through everything, but here's my two-cents:

At the end of that survey they had a comment box. I put in something along these lines: 

""I've been Rooing for awhile. Permanent bathrooms would be nice, I don't shower and I wouldn't use a waterslide/lazy river. I like that camping is included in the cost of the ticket, but have always felt that, at about $300, the cost of Roo is a steal.  So $125 for camping seems steep. Centeroo has enough going on that I don't need the campgrounds buzzing with nonstop stuff. For the last three years I've sat in 9+ hour traffic lines waiting to get stuck in pod 11 (which is about a mile from Centeroo that walk gets tiring by sunday) and I still have a blast.""

I do appreciate that they're asking us what we think. Floating the idea is not bad in-and-of-itself, I appreciate that they want to know more about what we want and that they're going to gauge our interest prior to tacking on a fee. 

Bottom line, I will still go, even if it costs me an extra $125 because I enjoy it.
