More than 60% of the responses indicated that people travel more than 600 Miles to Bonnaroo from all areas of the USA, though the majority of responses came from the east coast. (I see there was also someone from Rochester NY that came down, hit me up!)


Just under [37% of people stated that What Stage](http://i.imgur.com/0Us3R7t.png) had the best artists (which kind of surprised me, I was expecting some of the smaller tents to win this one)

[LCD Soundsystem was the favorite by a decent margin](http://i.imgur.com/QmxUCm8.png) The most common ""Other"" response was Nathaniel Ratecliff and Chris Stapleton. Death Cab and Ellie Goulding both received zero votes. 

[Best food was Amish Donuts](http://i.imgur.com/3RwU74S.png) and the most common ""other"" response were the Roti Rolls over at the Food Truck Rodeo.

Age: 11-12 (They did not know how old he was when I got him, they estimated he was around 4 or 5. This was 7 years ago (today actually.)

Sex/Neuter status: Male, neutered.

Breed: Black Lab

Body weight: 80lbs

History: I got him from a shelter 7 years ago. He had been bounced from several homes and been back to the shelter three times before I found him. He is very even tempered and rarely barks. I suspect he was the product of abuse prior to joining my family because he can be a little skittish even after all these years. He's sweet but kinda dumb too. I've attempted several obedience courses but it just never sticks. He's just a big lovable oaf. No real health issues, though he's certainly starting to slow down over the last year and a half. You can tell his joints are getting stiff and it takes him a little longer to ""bounce back"" after a busy day outside. 

Clinical signs: Typically he goes to bed with the lady around 9pm every night. He comes back down around 1130pm when I get home from work. I let him out to pee and then we hang out until 1 or 2 and go to bed. Usually he will sleep at the foot of the bed through the night and get up with my gf in the morning (7am) and have breakfast go back out. Once she leaves he will come back up and lay with me for a little bit then we start our day with some playing outside and hanging until I go to work in the afternoon. He's been great at keeping this schedule for 7 years.  Starting earlier this week every night around 3am he wakes up, hops onto the bed, forces his way in between us and starts pawing at our heads like he needs to go out. I've let him out but he doesn't urinate or move his bowels. We go back up and ten minutes later he's doing the same thing. He then starts whining and barking (something he never does.) and won't stop until one of us gets up and goes downstairs where he quickly falls asleep. It's like he doesn't want us being next to each other or is trying to protect us from something. Frankly, he looks possessed or like some kind of doggy sundown syndrome. I know I'll have to take him to the vet if this keeps up, but I'm just looking for some advice on what to do in the meantime (they take forever to get him in because they're so busy.)

I recently picked up an album (El-P's ""I'll Sleep When You're Dead"") and excitedly put it on to start listening. The surface noise was bonkers and I immediately became very disappointed (I spent more than I normally would on an album.) 

After popping on here and using that search bar that's hiding to the right I was able to find some info on what may cause this. After a thorough cleaning of both the album, stylus and the rest of the table I got better sound. Then I decided to start looking into speaker placement as something more than just symmetrical and easy on the eye and discovered that my big ass speakers were causing so much vibration that none of my albums were sounding the way they should.

I was really excited for The Hateful 8 because I was expecting something that felt similar to Reservoir Dogs (my favorite of his movies.) I went to the theater and left quite unsatisfied. My exact (and verrrrry clever) summation was ""More like Hateful 8 hours long...amiright?!""

I did not get the chance to see the roadshow version. Which many of my friends did and they said that made the difference. 

After leaving the theater over the next few days of discussion I realized I liked the characters, the story, the look, the feel it just didn't ""do it for me."" 

Now that it's available on bluray I picked it up and just finished viewing it again and now I'm blown away. It feels like an entirely different movie than I remember and it certainly did not feel as long as it did in the theater. 

The most standout piece for me though was how good the sound design was. The gun shots were especially excellent.

I hope they add in a quicker way to upgrade your operator. I also would love if they allowed more than one type of operator per level. It was a race to get the one I wanted most matches.

My group and I have already discussed avoiding reddit for the week before we get down there. Y'all had us panicked that our cars were gonna be thrashed by cops and what was left would be stolen by thieves lol.  

All-in-all we had a great weekend full of laughs, sweat, too much walking (pod 10 three years in a row!) and great tunes. Can't wait for next year, the 15th anniversary could be pretty cool. 

Finally, I had a thought about adding the ""all-day superjam"" on Thursday at the Which Stage. Grab some session musicians and have them play tunes from 1700-0000 with special guests coming and going throughout the day. I know it would never happen but a guy can dream right!
