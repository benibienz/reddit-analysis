4,"AFAIK usually not. A ""chargeback"" is a dispute that you can open, where you claim that a seller hasnt provided the service / didn't send the goods / didnt send the goods in the promised quality you paid for.

These kinda disputes can only be issues on commercial sales and the only way a sale can be marked commercial is by transferring the money via the non F&amp;F way, since only this option marks a transaction eligible for buyer-protection.

On the other hand, the only way to get back your money if you sent via F&amp;F is to mark unsolicited actions in your acount. (E.g. credentials stolen, credit card information stolen, etc) This is a way more complicated case, since it usually involves assuming that there've been illegal movement on the buyers side. 

This is where it gets tricky in winning the dispute. Lotta people think that a chargeback is someone sending the money, then opening a dispute and getting the money back. This aint working that easy on F&amp;F.

Usually its someone sending money, then waiting some time until someones finding out that their credit card /PP got misused, opening a dispute and getting their account frozen afterwards until all legal documents are provided. This is where a (key-)seller can't do rly much but wait and hope (and send in some screenshots). 

*If* the buyer - who claims that his account got misused - can back his claim by legal documents, he wins. Furthemore, if some 3rd party, whose credit card info got stolen and used in the process of buying, can provide evidence, then the seller loses the money, the buyer is facing legal actions and the 3rd party may or may not loose their money, depending on the credit card issurance. 

The bigges problem (imo) with paypal, is not that people can easily chargeback, but that paypal's security shitty as hell and 3rd party credit cards/stolen accounts are getting abused more often than it should happen. And in these kinda cases it's not the actuall buyer opening a dispute, but the one who got pwned.

39,"As always with this kinda stuff, you should ask yourself: 

Would I pay money for my own idea?

If you're already indifferent on the answer (which you seem to be, otherwise you wouldn't ask here), I would at least ask a couple dozen ""normal"" users what they think of it, e.g. people who aren't coding around the Steam API, since these will most probably become your main target audience. 

Ill try to read your post from top to bottom and give ya a rundown on the biggest problems of the end user. 

&gt; Sign in using multiple accounts at same time. - no coding required or files editing

People need their shared and identity secret. In order to obtain them, they either have to dig deep down in their mobile phone structure or create new accounts which will be 15 days Steamguard banned. 

&gt; Rest of that paragraph

That's a lotta functions and a lotta highly specified ones as well. 

&gt; Automated Trading

I'm running tradebots for almost a year now and always tried to simplifiy my application as much as possible. The least maintenance required the happier I am. But you can't get around rewriting bits and pieces every now and then, since you never know what the next steam update bring. 

This one *is* possible, dont get me wrong. But some of your potential customers may have to wait for the next hotfix, if steam breaks anything. 

&gt; Trading Card Farming

Yeah. Not much to say, that's always a good one.

&gt; Automated Chat

I may not exactly know what you mean (sorry then! :D), but for me it sounds like some form of makros for answering chat messages, quick options to add people, etc. 

Id again ask myself here where the use case is. There may be a couple very specialized people who would need this, but Im not so sure about the regular user.

&gt; Notifications

Always good.

Any notification that ain't an Event fired from the API: Easy - Hard to use for the customer, it all comes down to your design. Just for the Steam Store part: Wishlist is giving notifications of sales on marked games already. 


&gt; i will update the program regularly each month with new features (doesn't included hot fixes). the app will support to run in mobile phones (IOS, Android) and as WUP for windows 10 so it works on xbox and windows mobile as well, with the ability to sync your data.


I never did developed for any mobile OS, so I dont know how easy or hard it is, but that's a lot of plattforms for one dev. 

-----

Bottom Line: I see your idea here and I personally like it. But that's because I already see the challenges in my head and the thrill of writing a good program. Again, I - and probably a lot of others in this sub - will be looking more into the technical aspects of such a project. 

If you're thinking about doing such a big project and you're really down for that, write some docs first. At least an application analysis with potential users and all use cases. Based off of that, I would create a presentation, as if you'd go around town, looking for investors. 

When you finish these two, you should have a pretty solid picture of your project, including how long this will really take and what features will be in. Then talk to some regular Steam Users and get some feedback. Some of your features will get crossed of, while some new may be coming in. After that it's time to decide to stick to it or nah. =)

Hope this small rundown helps a little. 

Cheers and best of luck to you and your family! ",2016-08-11 06:02:03+00:00,d6cwwg3,1.0,t3_4x0t02,85122.0,SteamBot

45,"One of the best stories of the most recent time is probably published right here on reddit. Award Winner of /r/nosleep. It's split in 8 parts, each (I guess) around 4-5 Pages long. 

The protagonist is called Zander, who - out of boredom - challenged a friend that each tries to ruin each others life. While Zander thinks that this is just a joke, his friend - Daving *fucking* King - doesnt.

The way it's written originally was, that each day Zander posted an update, telling retrospectively about what happened in the past between the two of them. The beauty is in his way of telling the story and actively interacting with the readers via the comments.

FYI /r/nosleep usually aint a sub where you go if you cant sleep, but a sub which you leave and cant sleep after. It's filled with spooky, thrilling and exciting stories (although this one aint spooky, more drama). All written under the big premises that no one is to assume that any of the written stories is fictional. Its all biographical.

Check out the first part and decide if you wanna go on. The second series is just happening right now as well.

The comments on this thread are probably the most useful things u can find on the topic. But since its for retrieving the secret and identity key I cant promise that it'll work for a transfer. Should be though with a little trying around.

You can find the location of the needed file in one of the first comments by Husky (on your Android). After that its where it can get tricky (esp since I never worked with an Iphone). 

Afaik you cant edit live app data manually. Therefore you probably need to edit on of your recent backups in itunes and put the file as stated in the thread. After editing that backup you probably have to revert to that backup so the ""new-old"" data gets loaded in. 

Please let me know if this works or not. In case it is working, do a giveaway, I dont want em. (Well, I could make a giveaway in my botgroup or on here as well :P whatever fits your needs)

edit: wow just had a look through the comments. Dont do anything inside the app itself. All of that will throttle escrow on you. And saying ""android and iphone are completely different"" doesnt matter in this regard as its a simple textfile, it doesnt even have a file name. It IS possible with a little playing around and as long as you dont randomly delete any files, you should be good. ",2016-06-03 09:38:43+00:00,d3u9odz,1.0,t3_4ma5pp,34808.0,GlobalOffensiveTrade

111,"14 Months, all dollar values are pre-sale-tax. I live in a euro country and I usually say that 64% of the dollar-ingame value will land in my €-Pocket. 

Started Trading from zero to knife, ended up with 6k$ through standard lounge/reddit trading in the first 7 Months. 

Made 25k$ in the next 7 months by tradebotting, I'm donating 20% (5000$), try to do giveaways for 15% (lets round up and say 4k). Spent another 3k on multiple workshops in the hopes of getting better (nahhhh) and lost 2k by a market manipulated item (that's an experience that made me better :P).

So overall at +17k incl the 6 from standard trading or 11k without.


---------------------------------

*And since people are always interested in this topic I will give some more numbers so you can kinda get the idea of what its like :)*

That's 11$ an hour after all spending, (or 22 before) based off of regular 9 to 5 for 7 months (140 workdays) not accounting for bank holidays or vacation or illness. 

Let's take it further - since I never did the math before - and account for time spent setting everything up. Maybe one or two of you are interested in that as well... 

Learning the necessary language and skills (with a background in software development) took around 120h. Extended setup of a Raspberry Pi without any knowledge of the hardware but knowledge in Linux took 20h. Actually writing the bots, testing them, debugging, ... the whole proccess took 250h. Maintaining is around 0.5-4h a day (7 days a week). Depends on if there's a new steam update regarding the api, new case, escrow, ya know all of that good stuff + I rly love my Steam Group and usually chat and talk with some people. Lets say 30 days and 2h on average, makes another 420h. **Edit:** How the fk did i miss this? *blaaaazeeeee*

So time investment until today:  810 hours or 33.75 whole days. 

Aite lets say in a normal job you'll get 25 bucks an hour (random number off of my mind) or lets be more conservative and go with 15$

Thats 11000$ income and 12150$ spent in work time. Dang, at the beginning I calculated that it would take me more then a year to break even but if I wouldnt've had the incident with the market manipulation I would be there already :O 

Aite I think I've bored you all long enough =) pce",2016-05-12 11:04:37+00:00,d32j1cn,1.0,t3_4iy9ml,35179.0,GlobalOffensiveTrade

6-7 or such months back when I was still actively trading my niche (and my trading buddys one aswell, we met through this) were p2 karas. they were going on the sub for ~205 iirc. 

Im pretty good at making lounge posts and taking doppler screenshots and there's a real nice place on cache above hall which links connector and a and b where you can get all types of lighnintg..

blabla, whatever. I bought p2's for 180-200, lounge posts usually  had b/o's of 230, sometimes 240 or 250 depending on float and demanded 15% overpay in skins. tricking the common lounger, it usually took under 24 hours to get a 240 offer in liquid items. Did that for 2 months, made like 2 grand without beeing really actively negotiating or anything. 

Well but then recently there was this guy who thought that he should price manipulate in order to empty one of my bots, taking a grand from me. Let's just say that even a small town in kazakhstan cant help you if you madden someone working in IT Security.. Still dont know how I should feel about that tbh.

166,"Ya wanna hear the full story?:P

I started botting 8-9 months after I started trading (First was in October). Spent WAY too much time trading (like, alot of my free time) and got from 0 -  around 2000$.

Then at the start of october my telly broke and I wanted to cash out some for a new one. Back in the days there were items on opskins, that would grant 2.5-2.7$ AFTER fees instead of the usual 2$ if you sell keys via paypal. So I wanted to get them. But if you post 30 trades on csgolounge for items between 2 - 5$, you are getting spammed with 1000+ trades per day. I didnt wanna check them all by hand and beeing a software dev in rl, I started to get into botting. First bots were pretty simple and dumb, you send a redline, you take two keys from me -&gt; accept.

Well, someday I had my new telly and was bored, so I started working on the current project. (launch was on 14th of november) at the beginning stuff went horrible and I lost like 100$, but after hours and hours and hours of work (I'd guess somewhere between 200-300 hours), it's where its now. :) 

So yeah, im a boy from the street working my way up and ye, it was slow in the beginning :P But as with everything money related: The more you got, the easier it gets =)  ",2016-03-02 05:29:08+00:00,d0ke5ir,2.0,t1_d0k52gy,14159.0,randomactsofcsgo

I'll even enjoy buying a dped since some peeps really think that this lowers the price... 

like rly? ""BUT BOBBY, ITS NOT UNIQUE YO""........ Unique? On some pixels coded into a game?

If you jump on a server with 10 people in total, there are atleast 11 copies^^^:OOOOOOOOOO of the code of your exact same skin -  every time you buy it. 

And even if thats my opinion, I still understand people that choose to get the ""unique"" item for the same price (e.g people that actually enjoy playing counterstrike with nice skins(rarely seen)) , but when someone tries to squeeze the price by arguing this way, they deserve nothing more then a slap for trying to shark-by-creating-panic (^"" ""professional traders""^"").

265,"c+p from the last time I saw this question

---

Beginning aint easy but everyone of us started once and there are three ways to do it.

* You either offer a good price (if 2$ would be normal, offer 2.1$+ per key) Ofcourse youre paying a bit more but its just at the beginning.

* You spam every person offering keys 
* You wait until someone's specifically advertising that he's trading with starters. I (and afaik a couple others) do that quite frequently. Use search bar or spam refresh on new. =) Keywords should be something along the lines of ""RepBeginner"" ""RepStarter"" ""RepBuilder"", etc. You get the drill :) 

All in all you probably wont be getting more then 5 keys per deal but since its all about those comments on the group, it doesnt really matter :P

----

Besides of the active trading part you can prepare your profile. 

* Make a repthread even though you didnt needed it yet. 

* Check yourself on steamrep and check your friendlist for any banned/tagged people and decide what you want to do with those.

* Your inv shouldnt be 4c skins and hundreds of cases only. 

----


tl;dr 

Be active, be nice, be smart and keep your account clean.

I was experienced in Java and had basic understanding in a couple other languages. Never worked with js though and went from complete beginner to proficient user in around a month. Im not running any site though and strictly use the bots (5 currently) for different trade scenarios. Some are buying, some are selling.

Getting into it yourself would be somewhat mandatory if you want to run a site aswell, since if you hire someone there would be no garantuee that he'll offer support aswell. So if anything breaks or any new updates change the way your bots work, you'd have to hire a new one which takes money (and more importantly in this scenario) time.

For the start you can run your bots from your local machine in order to test them but sooner or later you will have to move them to a server/vps/raspberry or whatever in order to get that 24 h uptime.

336,"Adding new bots will always bring the prices down. Last time bots got added we had high demand low tier Items at under 65% Market price which was around a fifth lower on OP then what they were before. (example beeing redlines which I saw for 400 instead of 520 and 5.94$ beeing market avg. at that time) 

On the other hand we had high tiers which stayed relativly stable from what I saw. There were a couple quicksells but the avg market - althought dropping around 5-10% in general - didnt seem to adapt to these changes as much. 

For people wanting to sell their cheap stuff in order to get a nice knife this is a nightmare. In this regard we're getting closer and closer to Steam Market beeing more profitable. 

Lets calculate an example! 

The cheapest Bayonet Phase 2 Doppler right now (24k OP) is 20% below the cheapeast one on market (300$). On the other hand the cheapest redline ft is at 436. That makes 33% under market (5.81$). Lets say Im a subscriber and get 414 OP per redline then Id have to sell 57.9 Redlines to get it. If I sell my redlines on community market I'd get 5.05$ after 13% tax. That makes 59.4 Redlines. After rounding both values that is one redline difference. 5$, 2 keys. 




---

Now for the people that are selling stuff to cashout (no worries, this will be a smaller paragraph :P).

Before the last bots were added I had the feeling that we were a solid 20-25% below market which is a really nice skin to $$$ ratio even with rake accounted, especially if you take the security into consideration. 

If we were suddenly at a constant 30-35% below market ratio (which isnt far from beeing realistic if we could put items up all day long)  and had to substract 5-10% of that amount in fees,
we'd be at 66.5 - 58.5% Market-Cashout amount before Paypal Fees. This is low. Even for cashtrading. This could hurt OP really hard in two ways and I personally dont want that.

337,"Thats a common issue if putting shit up while the steam servers are screwed (like they were when bots were open).

TBH with you, I thought the prices would stabilize more then they did. 30% drop sounds a little harsh, you may be just unlucky to compete with someone who's offering for way lower then usual.

After the bots came out most of the low tiers dropped by a good 20-25%, high tiers around 20%. As the bots are getting fuller and fuller the price is rising aswell with low tiers beeing at 15-17% below what they were before and high tiers at 13-15%. 

These numbers are from a very small pool and probably wrong for a number of items, although Im mostly watching high demand stuff from vulcans, asiimovs etc to bayo/m9/kara dopplers, TT, marble etc.

Besides all of that I am still happy that everyone gets to finally sell their stuff. 

And if you are selling to cashout you shouldnt complain since the 80% Market that you can cash out (or 73,72% incl 5% OP Fee and 3% PP) is still 15-20% (8-13%) above usual Paypal or Bitcoin Skin prices. (Dont forget how much safer OP is in comparison with 1 on 1 trades)

As OP already stated in his awnser wallet transactions are impossible to trace since (usually) there shouldnt be any personal information linked to the wallet. If you're having an online wallet all the communication should be encrypted aswell, so thats for the security.

On the other hand I see your problem. If youre in a private insolvency (sorry for any english reader if thats making no sense at all :P) or had to give an affidavit (eidesstattliche Versicherung), then your debt holders can know for sure if you transfer money from your bank acc. to somewhere else (e.g. they see that you transfer it to buy bitcoins, after that theres no trace left though) .

Anyone not german and reading this might think 'Well, just use Local and meet up and buy anonymous', but nononono. Our great leader^^/s has so much fear about not beeing in control that they banned any meet-and-buy site in germany. 

tl:dr

Me as german am telling you that yes. Your **bank account** transaction will be traced. Bitcoin transactions **can't be traced**. You can't meet-and-buy on the big BTC trading in Ger.

530,"In addition to this, it could simply be you getting nervous aswell. I won a magnificint amount of clutches not because Im a good aimer (hell, I am not lol) but because I kept calm. Thinking and breathing is way more important in clutches then you may thought of, its what usually makes or brakes close calls in any (e)sports.

Get into the habit of planing ahead and youll win more and more of those. 

Example: Overpass. 2v1. You  and buddy ct. You in monster and hear that your bud gets killed from short. You rotate into water to have the element of suprise on your side. Then you hear the T run off to blue connector so you know he goes A.

You got a couple decision to make after you know that A's the deal. You could straight out go after him through connecter or could swing around to A. 

Lets say you go A. Once again you got different options. Lets say they are facing or beeing sneaky. Since you were thinking it all through, you are pretty sure that hes going connector to A and you take the long way over CT.

Times ticking and you decide to be smart. Coming on spot you see a flash pop in the distance, you're there before him. Peek him? Nah. He's trying to outplay you, therefore he thinks that youre prolly still on b. You hide behind the green box. Hes coming, you hear him plant on the other side of the box, boom one tap, your round. Everyone happy, bra's flying in the air. 

You get what Im saying? In 1v1 clutches you gotta be the one making the calls, dont simply react. Be smart, be wise, be sneaky.

712,"Ya'll gotta relax. You do know damn well what you can expect when trading on lounge and I'm pretty sure that 90%  of the people here calling loungers out are doing the exact same thing over there. (me included)

The broad mass is unexperienced and uneducated when it comes to trading and probably as frustraded as everyone else. Therefore they're rude, they're lowballing, they're mad bc they thought that that Gut Safari which they bought for 90% was a mad deal... Starting to trade is a huge mindfuck since there is so much information that you need to have in your mind and beeing a little irrational is healthier then screwing up.

And again I'm pretty sure that most of us were like that in the beginning. (again, me included). 

That is why we are coming to this subreddit. Not only to trade but to educate ourselfs. To learn techniques, to learn the prices of shit or to rant a little when we cant take it anymore. That's what makes this sub as fucking amazing as it is. Although we are all competitors our relationship is much more. We are teacher and student at the same time and we should all realize that we can call ourselfs lucky that we are able to differentiate a good from a bad offer. A lot of people can't. 

So lay back and start to not give a fuck about it anymore and dont take it personal. If you're (general - not aimed @ OP) getting that mad about people asking for all kinds of ridiculous things then you are doing something terribly wrong.

1118,"Let me ask you a question... Where do you think  all the QS are coming from that you are getting here? 

I am one of the ""loungers"" that is asking for more value in Items if someone wants to offer in those, not because I am a greedy hoe but to get atleast some out of it. 

Because if I got something up on lounge I want keys for it, just like the most of us, to get a new deal here. Item offers (@high tier level atleast) of equal value are more often then not hard to sell stuff that will never go for MP with most of them beeing hard to sell even at 90%. So why should I trade a Kara Doppler which is very high in demand into 2-4 st ch hunts ww or whatever? Ofc, there will be offers where you get lucky and someone is giving you 10% more in heavily liquid Items (a.k.a bets), but that's an exception, that you shouldnt count on.


When doing Item trades -@ high tier -I am looking for one of two scenarios: 

a) I do it for equal value when I can sell that stuff much quicker then what I got right now. 

b) I am getting overpay on hard/slow to sell stuff, to qs it.

Downgrade = I can get the keys I want quicker. =) 

If someone needs to offer in Items on that Cyrex ft though, I wont give it away without a key more in return. Why would I trade that for equal value when I'd have to redo all my trades? Nah

**tl;dr**

Overpay /= more profit. It can be the case but generally you want to qs the stuff you get to get your keys quicker.",2015-07-11 11:39:21+00:00,cszmbi1,4.0,t1_cszlw6k,1916.0,GlobalOffensiveTrade

1153,"I didnt read your comments, but the most smartes thing to do, is use the friggin search bar here. Search for your stuff and for how man k **it sold** in the last week **on reddit**. I repeat, that it's important to know for how much shit's going on here, because most of us are more conservative in the pricing then lounge and will buy/sell for lower. For stuff thats 400 or below, you can usually use analyst, although swings do happen and no one is safe.

For stuff that's not on market and high in demand (*high in demand is important and will only include bayo, m9, kara from here on*) you wanna go for fades, dopplers, marbles with dopplers and marbles at the top, followed by fades and then maybe TT (since these have a rly ""boring"" pricing, because they dont differentiate that much inbetween them).

So, you inform yourself for how much the shit sells on reddit. Let's say (*this will be an example from now on*) Kara Doppler P2 is going for 200 at avg. You take one of those or wait for someone dropping a 190 bomb (which will take a while), because you know that you could sell them at here for around that price if shit's going down. 

Dopplers are having a huge fking demand that probably only get topped by kara fades right now, but it's easier to price and sell, since A) you only got to look at the inv pic to know what it is and B) If searching on lounge, it's easier to finde one of the four dopplers, then one for the 10(?) fades. And with ""you"" I mean your friggin customer.

Alright, you got that good looking P2 that we talked about. Now go over to lounge and open up a nice trade. Set an realistic buyout for yourself, thats around 10% over the avg. price on here. E.g you got the p2 for 200, you want 220 on lounge. Then simply add 5k since people will always try to lowball you a bit.

Make sure that you got nice screens in and that you arent overexaggerating in your offer like that whole fake sapphire/ruby shit that's going on... almost every p2 is full red/pink in the right light...

Alright you got that up for 225, you'll probably wont get an pure offer that easy, but hey! You politly stated something in your trade along the lines of ""Taking Items @ 85, ST @ 70 and bets @ Lounge Price minus one key). If someones playing by this rule and hits your b/o and the items seem easy to sell (Yes, st knives are easy to sell @ 70-75), go for it!

Sell those stuff / Downgrade that aswell.

And let's say that Mr. Y is proofen and marked as a scammer on SR.

In this scenario, if Mr. X is buying an Item of Mr. Y (or *knows* that he is dealing with a smurf of him), well aware of the fact that the items he's buying could be scammed, then Mr. X has to be taken responible for that. 

His actions are grossly negligent and there is no room for any doubt about this. 

It's like you're buying a new TV of that shady neighbour of which everyone knows that he came out of jail a month ago for stealing TV's. The law would accuse you of beeing reckless in doing this buy and there's the possibilty that they would punish you aswell for dealing with stolen goods.

On the other hand, this chain of marks shouldn't be passed down too far. Let's say I bought a toaster of you legitimately 2 months ago - before you've been sentenced for dealing with stolen goods by knowingly buying them from your neighbour - then I wouldn't be punished, even though there may be some investigations.

Back to the first example. 

If Mr. Z was dealing cash with Mr. X before Mr. X was marked as a Scammer, then Mr. Z should fear no punishment. If he does however continue doing buisness with Mr. X - after he got marked - then he can **and should** be held responsible for this action aswell.

1218,"\+ there are various sites out there that gather the FV + more info about the skin/knive. most known is csgo.exchange (yes, "".exchange"" instead of "".com""). If you wanna check a specific inventory its:

csgo.exchange/id/STEAMID64

To get the steamId64 go to the persons profile main page you wanna check and you will find either on of those in the adress bar:

http://steamcommunity.com/id/76561198068796441

or

http://steamcommunity.com/id/tockbob/

if it's the first one, just c+p the big number into the csgo.exchange thing.

If it's a costum url (second example), copy the full url and go to steamrep.com. Past it in the bar in the middle and hit enter. It gets the ID64 in the same box + even more info below.
