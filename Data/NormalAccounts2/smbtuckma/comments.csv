2,"Something similar happened to me last summer. I'm a grad student in a neuroimaging lab, but lefthanded so I had never been in a functional study before. That's why I volunteered to be a pilot subject for a new study we were setting up. 

They found an abnormality on my pituitary gland, so the scan was sent to the on call neurologist. A few weeks later he called me and said it was probably a benign Rathke's Cleft Cyst, but gave me doctors at the medical center who could give me a second opinion. Since then I've gotten some blood tests and another pituitary scan, and it is indeed asymptomatic and now we are just monitoring for possible growth. 

When we scan, we're told to report any abnormality to the on call neurologist. If it's bad, he will get in touch with the subject that same day and set up a medical scan and possibly surgery. Most of the time, the abnormality is completely benign, so we usually don't even tell the subject and just let the neurologist decide if they should contact them or not.

If you're worried, you can try to call your GP or directly contact the neurologist who reviewed your scan. If the scanning center doesn't have his information online, ask the personnel whose study you were in. It may take a few calls but is worth it for the peace of mind.

3,"People largely don't understand the full extent of what Affirmative Action is. 

It's not just an admissions quota. That policy existed in the early days of Johnson's executive order, and is still around, but is not practiced at a lot of places anymore. Instead, meeting institutional AA policies is about reaching underserved communities to teach them about the possibility of college, help them take admissions tests/apply, and giving financial aid to families whose income qualifies them (race blind). For a detailed example, my undergraduate runs a Posse Scholar Program, which sends representatives to inner cities, identifies high performing students, and counsels them on higher education and how to apply. Up to ten Posse Scholars get a full ride fellowship based on their academic potential. Sometimes Posse Scholars are white, usually they're POC. Once on campus, they're assigned a Posse mentor which helps them adjust to college life, as many of these students are first-gen and have never focused so exclusively on academics before, all while living away from home. In addition, 60% of the student body is getting some sort of loan-free financial aid from the school. The administration publishes goals for increasing student diversity, but these are done through college recruiters visiting communities largely passed over by other recruiters and there are no explicit quotas.  

As an aside, legacy admissions are still a thing, and that's not criticized as heavily as AA. ",2016-11-20 23:07:24+00:00,da8rdcy,8.0,t1_da8nff3,5372,AskWomen
4,"That's kind of still an open question. 

The traditional theory is universal basic emotions (Paul Ekman is a popular proponent of this theory). This asserts that there are certain hardwired emotion-behavior relationships that were advantageous in evolution, so they're innate and not learned. This includes smiling with happiness, crying with sadness, baring teeth when angry, or scrunching up nose with disgust. There is decade of research behind this theory, showing these patterns across human age and cultures.

However, the ""new guard"" of emotion is gaining prominence, led by the formidable Lisa Feldman Barrett. Tbh I'm still working on understanding her theory in detail, but the essence is that emotions aren't discrete, there aren't consistent relationships between emotional experience and behavior, and that we learn to express emotion more through an algorithm-free, Bayesian learning model where behaviors are linked with internal experience states through a probabilistic judgment of what social effects those behaviors elicited in the past (e.g. mom came to comfort you when you cried). 

Most young emotion researchers these days tend to side with the second theory. Lisa is publishing a popular book on it next year, so that should hopefully be very informative. ",2016-11-20 05:39:23+00:00,da7vu2q,1.0,t3_5d8nbo,325914,askscience

(Answer to that one is no).

Me personally, I would make a distinction between internal validity and external validity.

29,"Last year, our psych department awarded 9 new PhDs. Seven of them went on to industry (Disney, Facebook, Adobe are the companies I know off the top of my head). 

Since psych is so data oriented, it can really prepare a student for data science and get them in the door at a higher level than a bachelor's or master's would (since they technically have more work experience). Also, I don't know how prominent this opinion is throughout industry, but it definitely exists among some people that Psychology PhD's are preferred candidates for data science jobs than computer science folks because along with data management, we're trained in correct sampling methods, statistics, experimental design, etc. So, if you focus on improving your methods capabilities, industry jobs are a career option you can think about as well as academia. Plus, the length of a PhD gives you plenty of time for data science internships you can take on in the summers as well (these days more and more PIs are warming up to this). The [Insight Data Science Fellowship](http://insightdatascience.com/) is a pretty well regarded path to move from academia to industry if you choose.

35,"&gt;Do you mean to say here that brain scans from one scientist to another differ because they use the software/hardware differently or rather they chose what to include? I'm not sure if that's what you mean by this.

I can walk you through a hypothetical fMRI study design and analysis. I'll bold the steps that involve choices that can impact the numbers that spit out. So, let's assume we have the perfect experimental design and we know exactly what signal we're looking for (in reality these are futher choices that impact what conclusion we make at the end). Before we can scan anyone, we need to **pick the scanning parameters of the machine (what physiological marker of activity are we looking for, where in the brain do we want to optimize for, etc.)** People tend to move around during scanning which blurs the image, so **we have to choose how to measure subject movement, how much movement is too much,** and **whether we want to do motion correction to the images or just throw those subjects out of analysis.** Then once we have all the pictures, we have to pre-process them to remove noise and normalize the pictures. Noise can come from the machine electronics or from physio patterns we're not interested in, **so we have to decide which method of electronic and physio noise removal to use.** These each come with varying assumptions about the data that may or may not hold up. Then, we have to warp all the pictures to look like one another because people's brains are shaped differently. We have to subjectively choose **how similar is similar enough,** and **the method of spatial normalization.** This comes with a huge assumption that there aren't major individual differences in the spatial representation of activation between people. **We also need to choose which standard brain picture to warp everyone to.** Sometimes you can also get weird signal artifacts, like image aliasing or signal spikes. **Have to decide what threshold of artifact seriousness is worthy of removal,** and **how to remove that artifact.** Then you can do your first level of hypothesis testing - are there effects within subjects. **Deciding what statistical test to run** is a choice the researcher has to make, along with **the significance criterion (p &lt; 0.001 maybe?)** and **the Type I error correction method.** Also, **the auto-correlation correction method.** At this step **some researchers might choose to add regressors and covariates, or not, depending on what they think is important to include in the model.** Finally, you can do your second level analysis across subjects and **decide if you want to do full brain analysis or region of interest (ROI) analysis.**

I split those comments up cuz I was getting long-winded, sorry! ",2016-10-31 04:22:36+00:00,d9eygoq,6.0,t1_d9ew453,3625,science
36,"For your first idea, it could be done to show that there is some perhaps sort of difference between children's brains based on the family structure, but what would this difference mean, and what task should the participants be doing while being scanned? It couldn't be used to show that there are differences in behavioral deviance without having the participants do something that is supposed to be tied to behavioral deviance, or without a previous hypothesis of what sort of brain activity difference to be looking for. ""Average brain patterns"" doesn't really mean anything without more specifics. When we look for brain activity, common things we look for are functional connectivity of areas (how much do they activate together), strength of activation between conditions (e.g. more amygdala activity while viewing scary faces than during rest), or the correlations between this within-subject activation strength and some behavioral measure. We can't measure absolute levels of activation because of natural and unexplained physiological difference between people, so we have to do within-subject subtraction between different psychological conditions. I could see doing an imaging study to look for signal strength that correlates with these behavioral problem questionnaires, but I don't know what tasks the subject should do to elicit that signal and again, that doesn't help us answer the question any better than the surveys alone do. I could also see doing an imaging study looking at activation during some other task, like prejudice testing or emotional reactivity, but that's a different research question. The question here is inherently behavioral, not physiological. 

&gt;but being a fellow scientist I'm sure you can appreciate that looking at a hypothesis from several angles is the best route of exploring something and the putting together all the results that each methodology has produced in order to get at the big picture.

I certainly appreciate that, I think interdisciplinary work is really really important. But in your original comment you said physio measures would be better than survey, and I'm more inclined to say they can supplement, not replace.  

&gt;I don't exactly like studies like these that, from what little I can gather, make such big conclusions from using only one method (questionnaires).

No matter the method, it's important to consider exactly what the research question was and how it was operationalized. The author's hypotheses were 1) ""How do child behavioral adjustment, parenting stress, and couple adjustment change over time from W1 to W2,
and do any changes differ by family type (same-sex or
other-sex parents)?"" and 2) ""What factors (i.e., child behavior problems, parenting stress, or couple adjustment) assessed at an earlier time point (W1) longitudinally predict child behavioral adjustment and family functioning at W2?"" She then operationalizes these constructs with survey measures. Interesting methods questions to ask are, does the Child Behavior survey capture school behaviors that we actually care about? I'd say it does, it's very extensive plus backed up by both parents and teachers who are blind to the purpose of the study. Parenting stress might be interesting to look at another way, but there's a lot of criticism over how physio measures of stress are really unreliable right now as a measure of psychological experience, whereas asking someone to say what their psychological experience could be affected by demand characteristics or unconscious processes, but it's a debatable question whether a stress signal that is that weak would be something we care about. So, the results specifically speak to family type correlation with parent stress and behavioral problems in school. If we want to say something bigger like ""children are just as healthy,"" we need more studies of different specific facets of health. ^(I will note though that the study is relying on frequentist statistics to say there is a null effect, which you technically can't do. You can say there's evidence of an effect, but there can't be evidence of no effect. You need Bayesian stats for that). ",2016-10-31 04:22:17+00:00,d9eygad,6.0,t1_d9ew453,3606,science

38,"Well, as someone who does almost exclusively functional brain research, I can say that this notion that brain activity is objective is false. It's a lot more difficult to do well and accurately than survey measures because there are so many researcher degrees of freedom (choices during analysis that can impact the results), the method is so complex that few people using it really understand it all, and brain modalities such as fMRI and fNIRS are inherently indirect and correlational. Not to mention, it's up to humans to infer what brain patterns mean and that gets into the same conceptual arguments we see with behavioral methods. 

In this case, what would we be looking for specifically brain wise? There isn't one area that determines behavior problems in children, and there isn't an established biomarker like functional connectivity or peripheral physiology we can look for either. We have some studies suggesting patterns like this that accompany deviant behavior, but the causal link definitely isn't established at all so it can't be used as a stand in for measures of the actual behavior. It might be interesting to throw in some physio measures (coming from my interests, I'd love to see the neural synchrony patterns in the family between hetero and homosexual parent groups), but those would only be secondary analyses and wouldn't add to the main question. 

It is always important to remember the limitations of self report, and see if they apply here. Is there reason to believe there would be demand characteristics that would skew the results significantly? Is there significant drop out between both survey time points? Do the questions fully capture the construct of interest? But brain imaging definitely has limitations too, and I'd say in this context those limitations are much worse.

This is a previously validated measure with an alpha score of 0.95. The teacher rating measure was similarly long and internally consistent.

44,"Pretty much. The math is more complex that this, but a quick way to understand it is that there's an inverse relationship between effect size and sample size. If you're looking for a very large effect, e.g. the mean between two groups of people is huge, you don't need a lot of participants to show that that difference is real. If you're looking for a small difference between groups, you need a lot of participants to show that that difference is real. ",2016-10-31 00:01:16+00:00,d9en177,7.0,t1_d9em8v3,1087,science

46,"The whole reason we question sample size is because it's a component of statistical power, not because it's important on it's own. Statistical power also depends on the magnitude of the effect in question, and the significance criterion. It doesn't really make sense to ask your question, as a small sample size means very little on its own. So instead of criticizing studies for having some objective standard of a large sample size or not, it is more fruitful to ask ""is the study well powered?"" 

Like /u/nerdloaf said, some things have really huge effect sizes. You don't need large sample sizes to get sufficient power in those cases. Other things have small and fragile effect sizes, so you need a large sample to really probe whether or not you can reject the null hypothesis. 

Power, by the way, is a real number that you can calculate from your planned sample size, significance criterion, and anticipated effect size.

Abstract:

""Amygdala circuitry and early life stress (ELS) are both strongly and
independently implicated in the neurobiology of depression. Importantly,
animal models have revealed that the contribution of ELS to
the development and maintenance of depression is likely a consequence
of structural and physiological changes in amygdala circuitry
in response to stress hormones. Despite these mechanistic foundations,
amygdala engagement and ELS have not been investigated as
biobehavioral targets for predicting functional remission in translational
human studies of depression. Addressing this question, we
integrated human neuroimaging and measurement of ELS within a
controlled trial of antidepressant outcomes. Here we demonstrate
that the interaction between amygdala activation engaged by
emotional stimuli and ELS predicts functional remission on antidepressants
with a greater than 80% cross-validated accuracy. Our
model suggests that in depressed people with high ELS, the likelihood
of remission is highest with greater amygdala reactivity to
socially rewarding stimuli, whereas for those with low-ELS exposure,
remission is associated with lower amygdala reactivity to both rewarding
and threat-related stimuli. This full model predicted functional
remission over and above the contribution of demographics,
symptom severity, ELS, and amygdala reactivity alone. These findings
identify a human target for elucidating the mechanisms of antidepressant
functional remission and offer a target for developing novel
therapeutics. The results also offer a proof-of-concept for using
neuroimaging as a target for guiding neuroscience-informed intervention
decisions at the level of the individual person.""",2016-10-16 03:38:35+00:00,d8tx5yr,2.0,t1_d8tmgj8,16801,science

62,"GRE is only one part of an application, and I've gotten the impression that most PI's don't care too much about it. That being said, Neuroengineering/Neuroscience requires a lot of quant skill, so a 47%ile is a big red flag on your transcript to some colleges, and it may not be possible to get past an initial review committee with that score in order to be seen by a PI. You should take it again, and hopefully you've been studying the quant section. 

But to make you feel better about maybe doing worse on the verbal, have you checked exactly how many of your prospective schools require all scores? Most only require one full set, and many even let you pick and choose the best sections from different test dates. If the admissions page online doesn't give this info, just make a quick call to the admissions phone line. 

Also adding to u/Tiny_Rat's anecdote - my scores were 97%ile verbal, 91%ile quant, and 50%ile writing.

72,"It has to do with the nature of statistical variance. This is a test where prior experience with stimuli will influence the timing measure more than the effect of interest, but that doesn't mean the effect still isn't in there and isn't valuable to know. So just one score isn't very diagnostic for one person. But, if you take it a hundred times, you'll get a distribution of different scores. Though this distribution has a range of values, there is a normal shape to it where certain values (ones in the middle) are much more likely than others. And if you compare 100 scores where left hand pairing came first to 100 scores where right hand came first, those distributions are sufficiently different enough to indicate that such a result is really really unlikely were the effect to not exist. The distributions can overlap a little bit, and if you picked out just two values from that overlapping part, it would seem like the opposite effect was happening. 

So essentially, because other things are contributing to the score, it's not diagnostic at a single score level. But when you take the test enough times, the pattern emerges.

- the extraction algorithm didn't distinguish between focal and non-focal hypotheses, which is important in a field where it's not uncommon to do really low powered secondary analyses just because it's easy to do it, but to not read into them very much. 

- The power estimates aren't computed correctly, since fMRI data is unitless 

- The numbers are also meaningless because they are maximum t statistics at a voxelwise level, which means that 1) they are subject to a huge selection bias, and 2) they aren't even the statistic that is being used for inference (which is usually based on cluster extent).

127,"I may be biased because, well, I put the information in the sidebar. But here's my take on this article. 

First off, I want to emphasize that when we talk about ""good"" and ""bad"" on this sub, they're very relative terms. *Unless you have an allergy or other medical condition,* nothing here is actually ""bad"" for you in a health sense. These are just things that improve or decrease the cosmetic appearance of hair. Even that is subjective, because some people prefer certain appearances over others. We've never stated that sulfates are toxic, so this sub is in agreement with source 1. 

In source 2, they created a shampoo with varying concentrations of PEG-4 distearyl ether, distearyl ether and dicaprylyl ether wax suspended in SLS and then tested the breakage amount afterwards. There was a significant relationship between wax concentration and breakage reduction. *This doesn't say anything about SLS, because all the tested shampoos had SLS.* The only variable of interest in this part of the study was wax percentage. What it does say is that sulfate shampoos with good conditioners will be less damaging that sulfate shampoos with no conditioning formulation. 

Source 3 is another safety assessment of SLS. Again, we've never asserted that SLS is in general bad for your health. Only if you have particular skin sensitivities. 

Source 4 is yet another irritation investigation. See above. 

Walking through the PC article, we're mostly in agreement except for a couple key points. They debunk the logic fallacy that because SLS is in household cleaners, that doesn't mean it's automatically bad (water is in those cleaners too!). They also point out that sulfate-free doesn't necessarily mean better - sodium lauryl sulfoacetate, disodium laureth sulfosuccinate, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, sodium cocoyl isethionate, cocamidopropylamine oxide, and sodium methyl 2-sulfolaurate are all very common sulfate alternatives, but some of them are still anionic surfactants that are just as strong as SLS. 

Where my informed opinion differs is where they claim that there is no research to suggest that sulfates are a problem. First off, they provide no direct studies of this claim with null effects, so even if H0 is true, they don't have the data to back that up. Secondly, here are my own citations that do find an effect of sulfates and other anionic surfactants over cationic and nonionic alternatives. 

Gavazzoni Dias, M.F.R. (2015). Hair Cosmetics: An Overview. International Journal of Trichology, 7, pp. 2-15. - Anionic surfactants leave an alkaline residue on the hair that breaks down the outer lipid layer, decreasing tensile strength and making the hair surface more hydrophilic (attracts water, which in turn causes hydral fatigue and weakens the internal hydrogen bonds). 

Gavazzoni Dias, M.F.R., de Almeida, A.M., Cecato, P.M.R., Adriano, A.R., &amp; Pichler, J. (2014). The shampoo pH can affect the hair: Myth or reality? International Journal of Trichology, 6, pp. 95-99. - Again, alkaline residue creates negative charge on hair surface, increasing hydrophilia and static/frizziness. 

Smart, K.E., Kilburn, M., Schroeder, M., Martin, B.G.H., Hawes, C., Marsh, J.M., &amp; Grovenor, C.R.M. (2009). Copper and calcium uptake in colored hair. Journal of the Society of Cosmetic Chemists, 60, pp. 337-345. - More hard water uptake in hair with more negatively charged places on the surface. Reduces shine and smoothness. 

Bellare, J., Iyer, R., Mainkar, A., &amp; Jolly, C. (2001). A study on the conditioning effects of natural shampoos using the scanning electron microscope. International Journal Of Cosmetic Science, 23, pp. 139-145. - In a scanning microscopy study, shampoo containing SLS resulted in more cuticle breakage than their formulation of Reetha extract and alkylpolyglucoside.

Harry, R.G. *Cosmeticology,* pp. 378-407. Leonard Hill Books, UK (1973). - Many commercial shampoos contain SLS and SLES at concentrations of 25-30%. For reference, most of these studies use a concentration of 2.5%-10%. Such a high concentration is not necessary for cleaning, but makes more foam, which is visually appealing to consumers. More damage associated with higher concentration. (However, this source is from more than 40 years ago, so I don't know how the typical concentrations of today compare). 

There are many, many ingredients in most haircare products, so the surfactant type will not be the only determinant for hair quality. Also, from a general scientific standpoint, this field is not the most rigorous in testing - most studies are very low-powered, aren't replicated, and some don't even report effect size or significance testing at all. So always maintain some level of healthy skepticism, read the research articles, and ask questions. **That being said, with all else equal, my reading of the literature says that yes, sulfates do result in more damage than cationic or nonionic surfactants.** For some people that's not a big deal, because they prefer the cleansing power to whatever negative effect the sulfates give them. In some sulfate shampoos, the concentration is low enough that the effect is minimal. In those cases, a sulfate shampoo may be the best choice for them. In the land of cosmetics, what *you* prefer is what's best! Here we just try to provide information so you know how to track down the kind of hair that you want.

128,"It depends on what signal you're trying to measure. If you're talking about functional imaging (the signal given off by a brain in action, basically), u/TurtleCracker is correct about 7 Tesla being the highest resolved in wide use (although [up to 12T](http://spectrum.ieee.org/biomedical/imaging/the-worlds-most-powerful-mri-takes-shape) has been deployed for human imaging). We can probably never get to the single cell level for functional imaging, though, absent any unforseen advances in imaging methods. From [Duyn, 2012](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3389184/): 

""How much further can resolution be improved with further increases in field strength? Can we expect to ultimately be able to reach resolutions of a few microns and image single neurons, as has been demonstrated on NMR microscopy systems operating at 14 T (Weiger et al., 2008; Flint et al., 2009)? Barring spectacular new developments, the answer is: “probably not”. NMR microscopy experiments have a number of advantages (other than the higher field strengths available for the small-bore magnets they use) that do not apply to scanning human brain in-vivo, including the use of very small (sub-millimeter) objects, scan times of many hours without object motion, and imaging gradients that are orders of magnitude stronger than human-scale gradients. The object size in particular can have quite substantial effects on attainable resolution. For example, with appropriately sized coil detectors that contribute minimally to the noise, SNR [signal-to-noise ratio] for an object that is n times smaller in each dimension is roughly n2.5 times improved (see e.g. (Macovski, 1996)), meaning that, because image SNR scales with voxel volume, the resolution can be increased by almost n-fold in each dimension. In contrast, the resolution improvement available when the field strength increases by a factor n has a smaller effect on the resolution of approximately 1/n0.33, assuming that SNR increases linearly with field strength (Redpath, 1998). It appears therefore that improvement of the resolution in structural MRI of the human brain to below 200 μm will require major improvements in detector and gradient design in addition to increased field strength.

Others factor that may limit spatial resolution in human applications are brain and head motion, and blurring caused by magnetic susceptibility effects. The former can be particularly problematic due to the increased scan times and lower tolerance to motion associated with high resolution MRI. While correction strategies based on MRI navigator signals or external tracking devices (see e.g. (Ward et al., 2000) and (Qin et al., 2009)) may be able to largely resolve the effects of rigid head motion, they will be less effective in correcting for incoherent (non-rigid) displacements associated with brain pulsation, which may reach around 100 μm in some brain regions (Soellinger et al., 2009). Timing (i.e. gating) the MRI pulse sequence with the respiratory and cardiac cycles may be necessary when imaging at such resolutions.""

Plus 7T makes some people feel sick and dizzy. It's unclear whether or not higher strength fields will have worse effects on human subjects. 

To add to that, I'd like to point out that fMRI is an inherently indirect measure of brain activation because it doesn't measure electrical pulses from neurons, but instead the changes in concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin in the blood feeding the neurons (neuronal activity consumes oxygen, so an overabundance is shipped to the activating cells to feed it). This is called the BOLD response, and lags behind neuronal firing by several seconds. This measure has been really useful for functional imaging so far, but it isn't as specific as the electric signal from a single neuron. This makes it difficult to pinpoint the exact cell the signal is coming from, and it's also difficult to establish effective connectivity (among two co-activating areas, it's hard to tell which is causing activation in the other). That's a critical barrier towards creating detailed brain simulations. 

Now, in terms of structural imaging (taking pictures of the physical architecture of the brain), there are interesting methods in development. [DTI](http://www.imagilys.com/diffusion-tensor-imaging-dti/) (diffuse tensor imaging) is an MRI-based method of imaging the white matter tracts in the brain, so you can essentially create a 3D map of where the bundles of connections are between cell populations. Right now there are issues with being able to model crossing fibers in a voxel (i.e. brain pixel) rather than parallel fibers, but there's work being done to improve on that (I'm far from an MR physicist though so I can't tell you more about that!). This doesn't help you with the effective connectivity again, but it does give a really detailed picture about what physical pathways exist, which helps constrain the set of possible effective connections at least.  

I can't really answer about where the technology is headed, since again that's not my expertise, I merely use the machines for my work. By it does seem like there is a ceiling to the usefulness of the current MR method for functional imaging, so we'll have to come up with a significantly different approach to get single cell resolution in the future.

131,"Triggers are a real thing psychologically and have been around a while in their own right - they are sensory events that ""trigger"" unwanted psychological reactions in individuals with PTSD and anxiety. Often they're a reminder of the traumatic event, such as images or sounds (things that might be found in a classroom lesson on traumatic topics, such as in lecture slides). The reaction to a trigger can range from a sudden wave of anxiety, to debilitating flashbacks that last days. Without the warning of an upcoming trigger, affected students can't brace themselves and it can really hurt a student's ability to participate in education. You can guess pretty easily about some things that will be triggers (the eating disorder story from above, for example), but most of the time you just say ""if there's anything on the syllabus that might present problems for you, shoot me an email and we can discuss it privately."" Students with particular needs don't expect you to just guess on that. Hell even my orchestra professor said that at the beginning of each semester. Sometimes the composers we played were racists/pedophiles/really awful people, and he couldn't guess when that might affect a student or not.

By ""heartache,"" I assume you mean the emotional pain of losing a loved one (either through rejection or death). One of my graduate advisors, Dr. Naomi Eisenberger, has done really pioneering work on showing how this social pain and physical pain share almost exactly the same neural pathway. [Here](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/302/5643/290) is probably her most famous study on the topic. This dealt with rather mild social pain (people stopped playing a ball game with you), but the principle carries over to more extreme forms. Some other work I know of has found that Tylenol can successful reduce social pain, like it does with physical pain, and people sensitive to social rejection also have higher physical pain sensitivity. [Here's a fuller review](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3273616/) of this body of work (I'm pretty sure it's not behind a paywall so you can read it). 

As much as this hurts, it's hugely evolutionarily advantageous, like feeling physical pain is. In the history of humanity, we're pretty awful at surviving on our own, so we've needed to group together in social organizations to survive. Additionally, because of our big brain, babies need lots of time to develop before they can survive on their own, so they need their mother (and father but to a lesser extent arguably) to stick around a long time. Both of these actions are taxing - navigating social relationships and nurturing children takes a lot of physical and physiological resources. For humans to survive in this difficult environment, it must be a better choice than parting ways. The pain of social exclusion is what motivates us to watch our children and affiliate with others.

139,"While I'm not familiar with the term ""killology,"" there is a lot of moral dilemma research on what modulates someone's willingness to kill someone. This research is often done using some variant of the [trolley problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem), in which a participant basically has to decide which set of people she/he's willing to let die in a train accident.  

For instance, consider you're standing at the point where a train track diverges. On on track are tied five people. The oncoming train is going to hit these people if you don't do anything. On the other track is tied one person. If you flip the switch in front of you, the train will divert and hit this person. Most people given this paradigm will make the utilitarian choice, and have one person die instead of five. However, some changes to the picture will decrease the percentage of people who are willing to kill the one person. 

There are two findings I know of that relate to your question. [The first](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/4264763/Greene_MoralButtons.pdf?sequence=2) says that when there is more *personal force* involved in the decision, you're less likely to kill the one person. That is, if the decision was to push someone onto the tracks to stop the train, you're less likely to say yes than if there was some switch you flip so that you indirectly cause their death. The second finding (same paper and [this one](http://pss.sagepub.com/content/18/3/247.short)) describes how you're less likely to kill the single person if their death is considered a means to a greater good, rather than a side-effect of achieving a greater good. That is, it's harder to move a person into harm's way to stop a train than it is to move the train out of the way, which then as a side effect hits a person. 

Building on these, there's some affective neuroscience work that shows how making the more difficult moral choice is very stressful and emotionally impactful, as suggested by self report and neuroimaging.

It seems to me that this would help support Grossman's assertion that killing in a personal way (using personal force as a means to an end, like in my examples above) would be traumatic. ",2016-08-18 20:43:05+00:00,d6n4mwk,1.0,t3_4xb05a,589068,askscience

Most 36-hour relationships don't have that issue.

146,"To be clear, there's some pretty bad stats going on in this ""paper"" (Not sure if it's technically a published paper - doesn't seem like it is). 

1) Doing an independent t test with only n=30 and uneven sample sizes AND unequal variances is really shaky. I didn't spend the time to bootstrap it so I can't say if this value is erroneous or not, but one should always be cautious of this sort of situation. 

2) Again, t-test comparing a sample of 2 to a sample of 11? You can't make any sort of valid inference from that. 

3) They're claiming exit poll discrepancies were bigger for non paper trail states than those with paper trails, but they only give you two effect size estimates and don't make any effort to statistically compare the two. If you do a mixed ANOVA, there seems to be a main effect of data time point (there is a significant difference between exit poll numbers and vote results, p=0.003) and a main effect of paper trail type (states without paper trails had higher for-Clinton scores than those with paper trails, p=0.008), but there is no interaction effect (p=0.726), meaning no-paper trail states didn't have any more exit poll discrepancy than paper trail states. 

Source                          SSq        df       MSq         F         p        

     Between-subjects factor    2392.395         1  2392.395     8.366 0.0084520
     Between-subjects error     6291.383        22   285.972
     Within-subjects factor      110.623         1   110.623    11.046 0.0030850

     Within-subjects error       220.332        22    10.015
     

4) Similarly, they should also properly test the effect of year (2008 vs. 2016) instead of directly comparing p values, which you can't do. In this case at least their assertion still holds true despite the error (interaction p=0.015, greater increase in Clinton favorability in non paper trail states between years than in paper trail states). But again, these tests still involve really low within-subject degrees of freedom.

Beyond all that, even if these tests were more valid, this is a reaaaaally reduced explanatory model for something as complex as vote outcome.

If they are leaking, it's time to get creative. Is a key bent slightly pushing it out of place? Is a spring too weak or broken, so the pad won't stay closed? Strategic small rubber bands help with that in a bind, so they hold things closed but your finger strength can still open the hole when required. If it's a bad pad, I've seen people tie little bits of plastic wrap or thin fabric over the pad to improve the seal.

182,"Like any other field, intro texts aren't able to encapsulate everything that's going on. They tend to focus on basic review of classic historical findings. So they help students learn if this is a topic they'd like to study, but they don't do a very good job of showing what research in the field is actually like today. 

To get a sense of why, compare a $100 intro psych textbook to [The Handbook of Psychology](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-047061904X.html). This is more reflective of what the state of the field is. There's no way to pare all that down into something digestible and accessible for intro students. 

And I say woefully underinformed, because perhaps the biggest paradigm shift in experimental psychology happened several decades after those guys. The field shifted much more towards highly controlled, cognitive approaches with statistical and quantifiable data (to a fault, even - a bunch of college kids sitting in a room alone at a computer screen isn't very ecologically valid). 90% of Internet criticisms of psychology not being a valid science say that the field lacks these approaches, which immediately tells you the author knows next to nothing about what psychology is now. Another 8% focus on simplified arguments of low reproducibility, but conveniently ignore that something very sciency like cancer biology [also has a big reproduction problem](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/future_tense/2016/04/biomedicine_facing_a_worse_replication_crisis_than_the_one_plaguing_psychology.html). Reproduction problems don't mean a science is invalid - they often mean a science is difficult, and the field young. 

Now a days, psychologists learn a lot of statistics. A large number of them (myself included) use very biological research approaches such as neuroimaging, peripheral physiology, etc. Others (also including myself) use mathematical approaches like dynamical systems and graph theory. Any experiment worth its salt is operationally defined and falsifiable. I'm not sure what you mean by the ""culture"" of academic psychology that Freud initiated, but if you're thinking of the old white men sitting in an ivory tower using thought experiments and anecdotes to make psychological theory, those days are long gone. They've inspired research *topics* that developed into more experimental versions of theory, but a much better example of someone who started an academic culture that still persists is [Kurt Lewin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Lewin), who cared a lot about actionable research and was heavily inspired by theories in physics. 

If you want to know more about a field in general, spend time around the people who are doing it. Visit psychological societies' facebook pages, stop in on the discussions by flaired users in /r/science, /r/askscience, or /r/psychology, or go to the office hours of a psych professor you respect and watch them light up when you ask about their research.

202,"It's not very common to do a master's before a PhD in psychology. Most PhD programs won't count the classes you took in your master's, so you will be essentially starting over on a second master's to get along the way to the PhD. Plus a master's is rarely funded for you, so that's a lot of money to put into something. That being said, I know a couple people who have done the separate master's route, and one of the benefits is if you don't have much undergrad research experience you can get it there (as well as maybe a paper or two) which will make you more competitive for the PhD application - you need 2+ years research experience these days to be a good PhD candidate, unless you have some other in. But it's an uncommon path.  

So *personally*, as a stranger on the Internet, I wouldn't recommend getting a master's first if your end goal is academia. You'd be better served doing a post-bacc in a social cog lab for a year or two (where they pay you, not the other way around!) and then applying for a Social Psychology PhD with a social cog researcher you really admire. Social cog is still a really big subtopic in the field, so it won't be hard to find potential advisors. I'd only say a master's is the best route if you have no research experience yet and it would be easy for you to pay for it.

224,"A couple things here. First, mental illness is not an objective measure of what is and is not normal human diversity. It wasn't all that long ago that it was considered a mental disorder for a slave to want to run away from slavery. Social and cultural environments hugely shape what we consider a normal human behavior to be. Even things that we consider to be so obviously abnormal, like schizophrenia, are not considered disordered experiences in other cultures (and in fact their auditory hallucinations are often much more friendly and unobtrusive than those in Western schizophrenia because of this lack of stigma). Likewise, other cultures see certain behaviors as problematic that we do not - for instance, it's totally normal and mandated for Western individuals to be highly competitive and stressed over individual success, but this is viewed as a psychopathy in other parts of the world (called neurasthenia, but nicknamed ""Americanitis"" for how many Americans are viewed to have it). 

Secondly, gender is not the same as sex. Sex is the biological characteristics of your body, whereas gender is a psychological conception of the self. Gender is not a choice, and the two can be mismatched. This mismatch causes a lot of chronic psychological stress, which we know is one of the worst things that can happen to a person healthwise. It fucks up just about everything. 

So should being transgender be a mental illness and treated with psychiatric medication instead of body modification? Transgender isn't abnormal in some other parts of the world where genders are considered to be non-binary or non-discrete, so we can't say it should be definitively. Should it be a disorder in the Western countries at least? The DSM says that for something to be a mental disorder, it must be 1) a consistent pattern that 2) reflects an underlying psychobiological dysfunction that is not 3) a culturally sanctioned behavior or 4) simply a conflict with society, and that 5)  causes significant distress to the individual. Transgender would meet some of these, but not others. On top of that, transgender individuals already have to see loads of doctors before they can get a recommendation for body modification. This process only happens when it is clear that this is better for the person's health and wellbeing than therapy and/or drugs are. So even if transgender does count as a mental disorder (gender dysphoria is still a diagnosis in the DSM), the recommended course of treatment *is* hormone treatment and possibly body modification.

Therefor, these results are good to know - since this single predictor model (that equation with a single x in it) is better at predicting data than just using average stress reduction, we can say that tree coverage causes some stress reduction and that more trees means more stress reduction. 

Let me know if this still doesn't make sense. It can be hard to boil regression down into simple terms :)",2016-05-05 02:51:24+00:00,d2tceed,3.0,t1_d2t5b0c,10908,science
244,"That's a pretty decent result for a single predictor in psychology. They're not saying this is a great model to use to predict stress reduction, but rather this single predictor linear model is significantly better at predicting stress reduction than a model that only uses the reduction mean; hence a relationship between tree cover and stress reduction. 

When gender, age, and baseline stress are also added, the overall model becomes stronger with adj R^2 ranging between 0.1 and 0.2 for the different stress measures. Still not perfect, but more reliable (don't want to get into overfitting the data either!). And anyways, the point of this model isn't a data-driven hypothesis to find the best possible prediction of stress reduction but rather a theoretical hypothesis about tree cover being a single predictor that has a nonzero effect.

251,"   &gt;What are the problems exactly?

The article describes many specific problems. You should probably do the reading before coming to discussion section. 

From the article, in list form:

- Some professors makes students with disabilities feel like ""others""

- Some professors don't consider mental illness to be a serious disability

- Some schools have a disability office, but don't offer any training to personnel outside the office (e.g. instructors)

- Some professors ignore accommodation letters 

- Many professors want to be accommodating, but they don't know how (if they get training at all, it may not be very specific or useful) 

- Students with disabilities have a hard time organizing all the accommodations they need by themselves in the first year (lots of bureaucracy to go through. This was a fucking nightmare for my own accommodation.) 

- Disability can be a social barrier 

- ACPA law is vague/not publicized, and students don't know what they're entitled to / what accommodations are available to them 

- Living with a disability on it's own can be lonely and challenging, let alone the difficulties of scholarship on top of it. There aren't many spaces where disabled students can go to for social support when their situation is overwhelming. 

So essentially, while accommodations are technically available, there can be a lot of barriers to attaining them. And the struggles of having a disability in university are psychologically difficult, and there aren't always resources for that.  ",2016-04-30 04:08:46+00:00,d2mzynm,1.0,t3_4h09d4,41267,GradSchool

At first I would blame him, saying if he doesn't miss me as much as I miss him then that much mean he doesn't really care about me. Or that if he wouldn't do things for me to make up for the distance like send me flowers (he definitely does not have a service/gifts love language) then that means he's selfish and inconsiderate. There was a lot of fighting over it.

But you really can't change people, even those closest to you, no matter how much you want to. It only started to feel a bit better when I made changes with myself. Firstly, it helped to try to understand better who we are as people and focus on and appreciate the good things that come with it, not just the bad. For instance, I'm one of [these people on the bottom row](http://imgur.com/zePJ9dw) in terms of identity, whereas he lives much more in the moment and just can't feel particularly strongly about things that aren't in his present experience. And these are good things, because it means I'm ridiculously nurturing and he can have a good time in any situation. It takes a lot of practice to get out of the threat-oriented frame of mind about distance and focus on what good you do have (I'm still working on it), but it can be done. 

Also, it's helped me to become more independent in my own right. I can go out and make friends he doesn't know, adopt hobbies just for myself, and otherwise incorporate people/things into my life that aren't all about him. I'll tell him about my day, but I can do these things for me instead of fixating on how much I want to tell him about this cool thing later on.

331,"I would argue that it's not even that much of a problem. 

[Alex Etz](http://alexanderetz.com/2015/08/30/the-bayesian-reproducibility-project/) wrote a good explanation last summer about why 35% replication doesn't mean 65% failed replication. It's more like 35% ish are pretty certain to replicate, 35% are pretty certain *not* to replicate, and that last 30% can't be interpreted one way or the other because the original study neither strongly predicted or strongly mis-predicted the replication result. So we have 35% of the studies in this set that we can be pretty sure aren't real effects as they were originally presented (not even in all of psychology, just in this set of studies, cuz there are some valid questions over how these studies were chosen). Another 30% we need to keep looking at (""Data, Watson! I can't make bricks without clay!""). I think that's cool - it helps us identify what the more pressing questions are to research.

On a more philosophical note, psychology is so damn complex. We're not going to create accurate models of it on the first go. And it's so expensive and time consuming to collect a lot of the data, so we can't run a million simulations to refine those models before publishing. So those 35% of failed replications aren't automatically indicative of bad science - indeed, replication (both success and failure) is an integral part of the scientific process. 

Now, there is certainly a file drawer problem that biases what stuff does get published. And that replication step doesn't happen very often like it should because that's not what gets you tenure. And of course there are a few people who made mistakes in their research or analyses, like in any field. Those are definitely issues. But to call this a replication ""crisis"" I think is too catastrophic. More like ""oh, that's interesting to know. Cool let's build off of that.""",2016-03-04 20:02:27+00:00,d0nqavy,5.0,t1_d0mow6h,72337,psychology
332,"I agree that chemistry is easier to reproduce and falsify because the system is relatively simpler than a human body and mind - that blog linked above mine is called ""the Hardest Science"" and I'm in agreement with that (not everyone agrees though so take that as subjective. And it's not like easier to reproduce = dumber or less valuable). 

But I definitely wouldn't go so far as to say psychologists are better scientists. Soooo many things go into being a good scientist, and what makes a good scientist in one field is different than from another. Between me and a chemist, for example, I suck hardcore at the math they need to do for their spectral series and so forth. But I'm really good at working with large sets of very messy data. (well, relatively, being just a grad student right now). I think there are differences in what makes research high caliber between the fields as well, so it's not fair to compare how ""good"" a psych study is to how ""good"" a chem study is. 

And I'd actually say psychology is less rigorous, because of how difficult it is. There are an unimaginable number of variables that effect human behavior. At the level of a molecule, there are fewer. In chem you can estimate true parameters and create very precise equations, whereas in psychology there are many more parameters as well as this huge error term to account for everything you can't think of. So there are many more degrees of freedom in your research. This means psychologists can make many more subjective decisions. Like, there are very few ways to get gas to change temperature - change its pressure or its volume. That's under ideal conditions granted so it's not that simple, but it's still much simpler than accounting for all the reasons a person might express prejudice in this particular condition. So if you want to raise a gas' temperature, you have a couple options. If you want to manipulate prejudice, there are many more potential ways (some of which might actually be the same, or simply correlated with the effect). Whether those research design decisions are correct to make or not is always a matter of theoretical discussion, but to me rigor means strict adherence to a standard protocol and there's very little standardization in psychology.

333,"IMO, much of this heat is a strawman. [Uri Simonsohn](http://datacolada.org/2016/03/03/47/) over on datacolada did a nice write up on how Gilbert et al. misused CI's to over estimate the number of studies that should replicate - and the OSC paper made the same mistake with CI's, underestimating the number of studies. It's not really fair to level critique at one but not the other. 

I agree with you that over interpreting the OSC results one way or the other is not good practice. One of Gilbert's biggest concerns is good scientific communication to the general populace. While yes this paper is somewhat statistically invalid, I don't believe that should take away from the larger message that Gilbert really cares about and that the RPP authors actually agree with - the OSC is not proof that psychology is a failed science in crisis. There are important reasons some of these replications failed that actually contribute to our understanding of psychology rather than detract from it - the ""hidden moderator"" argument. Psychology is bloody hard to model well the first time around, after all, because of how complex the human mind is. And just because something didn't successfully replicate doesn't mean it failed. Back in August [Alex Etz](http://alexanderetz.com/2015/08/30/the-bayesian-reproducibility-project/) looked at the OSC results from a Bayesian perspective rather than a dichotomous succeed/fail viewpoint and showed that while only 34% of studies replicated at least moderately convincingly and 38% accepted the null at least moderately convincingly, there's that 28% in there that just can't be interpreted one way or the other. Not awesome, but not as catastrophic as a lot of the media/journal editors/policy makers etc. have played it out to be - especially considering that this doesn't say anything about psychology in general, only the ability of the chosen set of original studies to predict the results of the current set of replications. As Gilbert and Nosek both attest, this ability is affected by sampling and methodological differences to some degree. 

In summary, I think the more important part of this critique is about how the OSC results are interpreted, and less about the exact numbers that come out of it. E.g. what does ""replication"" mean to us for practical and theoretical purposes, is it a natural part of the scientific process or a diagnosis of poor research, what does it teach us about the psychology versus the people doing the psychology, etc. Gilbert thinks Nosek et al. should have been more careful in their characterization of replication, Nosek doesn't think so, but both of them agree that this isn't a death kiss to the validity of psychology unlike what much of the world has taken it to be. 

For the curious, Nosek wrote a [reply to this reply](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6277/1037.3.full), and Gilbert wrote another [reply to the reply to the reply](http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/psychology-replications/files/gkpw_response_to_osc_rebutal.pdf?m=1457031863).

335,"The article talks about three big things:

**Non-random error -** In typical studies, especially psychological studies where systems are so vastly complex, there will be differences in results between participants who experienced the exact same experimental conditions. These differences are called ""random error"" and are generally ok so long as they affect all conditions equally and aren't expected to confound the experimental manipulation (meaning we don't want them to explain the data better than your intended effect). When the OSC replications were done, some of them introduced non-random error - changes to the experiment from the original study that made the effect less likely to occur. For instance, in a study on black prejudice that was originally run on Americans, the replication was run on Italians. Those groups have very different stereotypes. Another study asking students to imagine being called on by a university professor was replicated with a sample that had never gone to college. Unsurprisingly, both of those replications failed. Analyzing results from another replicability project by Nosek that did 16 studies over and over 36 times, they found that allowing such infidelities makes studies with a true effect fail 34% of the time anyways. In psychology the conditions of the experiment are really important and not controlling important variables in that regard can introduce non-random error. 

**Power** - Power is a measure of the chance of finding an effect in your study when a true effect does exist. So low power is bad, because there's a high chance that you don't find anything interesting when in fact there is something there. This is what ""sample size is too small"" critiques generally address, as sample size impacts your power level. Gilbert et al. here assert that the OSC replications were very underpowered - when again looking at the other replicability project that resampled participants 36 times and thus had a larger data pool, the studies replicated 85% of the time. 

**Bias** - Related to non-random error. Here, bias means that when confounds were introduced, they were more likely to cause a study to fail than to cause it to succeed even more. This is counter to ""random non-random error,"" where results are impacted but in which direction is random. In this paper, they report that the OSC project asked all the authors of the original studies to endorse or reject the replication research protocol. 31% of the original authors did not endorse the protocols as biased tests. Studies that had endorsed protocols were nearly four times as likely to replicate as studies with non endorsed protocols (as the supplement says, though, ""non endorsed"" includes both authors that rejected the protocols as well as the authors who just didn't respond).

ETA: Now, you'll see some other comments here pointing to other authors who say that this paper has its own statistical errors. You should check out the discussion about that, and whether or not that impacts the overall message of either paper. ",2016-03-03 22:33:14+00:00,d0mljpp,2.0,t1_d0misvg,4241,science

375,"To the rule comment, I'll add that you should talk very in depth about how much detail you want to share with each other, and write that down too (e.g., what sexual acts went on, or even if you bring up another person at all). Never use it as ammo when having an argument.

There will almost certainly be jealousy, if you're doing it as a solution to relationship frustration rather than wanting to explore outside sexual interests on their own merit. Start researching now how to manage that, and agree that you'll be patient with each other if someone is feeling jealous. 

The rules are never final. If anyone finds that they are uncomfortable, they should voice those concerns and you two should sit down together to amend the rules to fit your adapting situation. It's impossible to know right now how you will feel a few months down the line, so be ready to adjust things together.

And finally, when you two are together, be extra special romantic. Take them on a date they've always wanted, or try something new in bed together that you two will think is fun and sexy. No matter who you else you sleep with, this guy is the one with your heart, so make sure he knows it unequivocally :) 

I've been in this the last four years. It gets very difficult at times, because you're willingness to share him changes as your security in the relationship changes, and that ebbs and flows with various things going on in your lives. But you also get the chance to share physical intimacy with another person, which is a great experience in and of itself even if that person means nothing more to you than that. I know my LDR is right for me because whenever I've been with someone else physically, it just renews my passion for my SO and helps me see him again more clearly with more love and desire.

If there's no opportunity to work with them directly, ask what conferences they may attend this year and be sure to go to those so you can connect.

And it's true that if you can make someone happier, they tend to be more altruistic (""feel good do good"" effect). But there's interesting research in social psych and neuroscience from the last ~decade now that challenges our common assumptions about what needs are. That is, while we thought food, shelter, and what not were the most basic needs and social satisfaction is more secondary, it seems that social interaction is actually way more rewarding. Participants tend to seek out social interaction even at the cost of satisfying those other needs, being in a positive social interaction fires up the reward centers of the brain like cocaine, and a lack of social support seems to inhibit even the *ability* to have their other needs met (body doesn't respond as well to medicine, food is less enjoyable, etc.) ",2015-12-10 07:15:21+00:00,cxtvdc6,2.0,t1_cxtedgk,30648,science

What you're describing is known as Social Exchange Theory - that you help others because of the good things they give you in return (like social approval). Nowadays this isn't a prominent view of giving behavior, because lots of experiments have shown that people still enjoy helping in the absence of any self-benefit, and even with costs to the self. Where children were thought to be more social exchange oriented (ala [Kohlberg's stages of moral development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg%27s_stages_of_moral_development)), this work helps show that even they are less self-interested than we thought. 

More prominent theories these days describe the enjoyment of helping as an internal reward (i.e. we don't need a tangible benefit to feel good, the action itself is neurologically rewarding). That reward association may be learned through social norms and/or through natural predisposition - evolutionary psychologists have cited kin selection as an evolved behavior due to the advantages of your family surviving and propagating your genes even if you don't.

394,"You can [read the full PNAS article if you prefer](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/11/24/1509839112.full.pdf).

I'm having a little trouble understanding the core of drumkey's critique, but I *think* they're insinuating that ""social norm violation"" isn't operationally defined. The popular press article certainly doesn't share much info on that, but the full research article says,

 ""Each behavior (e.g., dancing)
was set in three situations: appropriate (e.g., tango lesson), weak (e.g.,
subway platform), and strong conditions (e.g., art museum). Participants
were asked to judge whether the behavior was appropriate from 1 (strongly
inappropriate) to 4 (strongly appropriate) by using an index and middle
finger on the left and right hand on a keyboard."" 

This is shown along with a figure showing how these stimuli were presented: basically, subjects see a screen with the situation, e.g. ""Emma is at a museum.""  Then a quick blank screen, then, ""she is"", blank screen, then finally the behavior that would signal a social norm violation or not: ""dancing."" It's random whether that first slide was an appropriate environment for the action or not. There were many trials of different stimuli like this. (more detailed info [here](http://www.pnas.org/content/suppl/2015/11/24/1509839112.DCSupplemental/pnas.201509839SI.pdf#nameddest=ST1)).

The authors aren't saying that the resulting N400 signal is a ""social norm"" signal, or any of the other attitudinal variables. In fact lots of previous research connects it more generally to error detection - perceiving something you weren't expecting or that shouldn't be there. (That's a bit of an oversimplification but it's good enough for this purpose). The authors are saying that Chinese subjects' N400 in the temporal and frontal areas are significantly greater than Americans', insinuating a greater neural sensitivity to the ""error"" that is social norm violation. What is interesting is that there were no differences for other forms of error, such as the semantic processing test they ran (correct versus incorrect subject-verb-object phrases). This is correlation as you say, but correlation is still interesting because we can say that this signal shows up when error is perceived in the environment. Since it's showing up in different ways between Americans and Chinese for social norm violation specifically, it seems like this is processed differently in the brain as a function of culture (specifically, Chinese subjects have a greater response). It's not just saying Chinese people have a different culture, but that that culture influences how the brain processes information. 

One of my mentors has done similar work to this, finding that East Asians and Americans process visual information differently in the brain as well ([link](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2894690/)).

413,"I haven't read that book, do you have a name or author for that study? 

My tentative take on it just from your description, is that we know there are certain factors about the receiver that hinder persuasion effectiveness. One of these is pre-rehearsal of counter arguments. This is actually a big idea that guided the research design in this project - smokers who wished to stop smoking were used, not smokers in general. Since smoking has been such a huge focus in public health messaging for decades now, smokers are well aware of the arguments against it (probably more than many non-smokers!) and have well rehearsed counter arguments for their continued use. Thus it can be hard to convince a smoker with no intention of quitting that yes, you really should quit. Deeper processing and integration of the persuasive message doesn't occur. I imagine then that the study you're referring to just recruited smokers without any stated intention to quit, so the ads only primed them for thinking about smoking (which is highly rewarding to them) and didn't result in self-integration of the persuasive message. 

I'm actually working on a study now that focuses on this persuasion resistance specifically. Initial data looks to suggest that certain executive function networks down-regulate the medial prefrontal activity, predicting persuasion resistance. 

Researchers have spent decades modeling factors about the receiver, source, message, and context that determine successful persuasion or resistance. If you're interested in it you can start with the classic book *Communication and Persuasion* by Hovland, Janis, &amp; Kelley. Then for a more modern take, Emily Falk is a leading researcher on neural mechanisms of persuasion.

We wanted to create this technology because it lets us discover causality about the brain. You know how people on /r/science are always complaining about correlation!=causation? It is a true issue in research interpretability, and so far all brain imaging is just correlation - we see this activity repeatedly when we think a person is doing this cognitive task, but we can't technically know *for sure* that this task causes that activation pattern. TMS allows us to experimentally manipulate the brain and say for sure ""yes this construct really is represented by this brain activation."" That's really important for using neuro research to understand how we as humans work and to help people out. Besides brain mapping experiments, TMS is also used for treating schizophrenia and major depressive disorder. All that makes it very worth it to me. 

And there's tons of ethical restrictions we operate under to make sure we never mistreat a participant or take the study design too far - it's hard to even get approval to lie to people in a study. Those ethical committees are composed of community members as well as area professionals to ensure we're not regulating ourselves. 

Arrogance of science though is a valid argument, I think. I don't believe any fears people have about scientific progress would come about through malice, but sometimes scientists are too caught up in how cool their discoveries are and think less broadly about their implications (the debate the atomic bomb scientists went through among themselves and later with the public is very interesting to read about). So we try to set up checks like ethical review boards, and science will always be tied to contemporary political environments. If you're truly concerned about ethics in mind science, I definitely suggest reading up more on the current research and talking with scientists to see what they're trying to do and their justifications for it. And maybe even volunteer to serve on an IRB review board. Just have some compassion in the process - we're people too, trying to help out other people in ways we think are best.

432,"Not so simple as that. pMFC is more generally associated with conflict detection. I.e., detecting discrepancies between current and desired states and then recruiting other regions to solve this discrepancy, such as switching motor behavior to achieve a desired outcome. Ideology can be thought of as a source of conflict resolution, (""Thinking of death makes me sad, remembering my belief in God makes me feel better"") but this study was investigating whether that is actually the same cognitive process as low-level conflict detection or not. The current data seems to religious ideals weren't primed (i.e. weren't called into mind) by the death scenario because down regulation of the pMFC turned off their ability to detect that as a conflict needing solving. 

So, they didn't decrease belief in God. They just made that belief less salient because it wasn't primed by this situation (in other cases, people tend to declare themselves as more ideological if they were just required to rely on their beliefs for some reason). As the researchers say, ""Our data therefore do
not reveal whether down-regulation of the pMFC via TMS would reduce either group bias or
religious belief *in the absence of a recent threat prime*"" (emphasis mine). According to the theory presented here, you could reduce an atheist's aversion to religion. But then it's also important to note that TMS effects wear off pretty quickly so it's not like we could force every ideological person to undergo TMS treatment and expect it to make a difference.

The rare beanies can fetch pretty high prices, and even higher for rarer versions of those (for instance, 1st gen hang tags; black text tush tags; manufacturing deficiencies that only a few in the world will have like Spot without his spot, etc). For reference, mint condition royal blue Peanuts are selling for $600-$1,000 right now on Ebay. 

If you really want to get the most out of the beanies you have, get the rare ones [authenticated](http://www.aboutbeanies.com/fakes/authentication.shtml). Basically a professional Beanie Baby Expert (I know right) evaluates your beanie primarily for authenticity, but also for condition and then can tell you how much it's worth. You can also use escrow services, where you arrange a buyer, then send the beanie to the authenticator who tells the buyer how much it's worth, they pay, and the authenticator sends the buyer the beanie and you the money. 

That's a lot of effort though, and you could easily get a few hundred for the rarest beanies without authenticating. Plus the worth of beanies drops off steeply, so that the not rare but uncommon ones are only like $20 and the most common beanies are like $5. So if you want to get rid of them fast, do as /u/kaliena said and sell as a bulk or just sell the rarer ones and donate the common ones to a kids shelter or the like.

We've known for a while that ventrolateral PFC activity is associated with response inhibition ([1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20084035), [2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2396584/) [3](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811907009974), [4](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811910001138), [5](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11169874), [6](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925492710001198), [7](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20308899), heck even my dinky little honors thesis in undergrad found that), so this is just an extension that includes behavioral measures of memory and activation measurement of brain areas that tend to activate for visual information encoding and working memory. 

Of course we shouldn't assume that a study *will* replicate unless it's a robust paradigm that has already replicated a ton, but this study was designed well. The authors [repeated this experiment three times for just the behavioral measures](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8Tmg-CiFAq_dl9TOGgybktXUjg/view) with independent samples, so they replicated themselves, and did a fourth experiment to make sure all of this wasn't due to event congruency. The authors also did a power analysis beforehand, using an anticipated effect size from a different publication besides their own (a bit more independent) and recruiting more subjects than recommended for the typical threshold of power = 0.8. Doing a quick calculation with their measured effect sizes shows that their post hoc powers were 0.67, 0.88, 0.74, 0.75, and 0.93. Some of these aren't ideal, but still somewhat encouraging for future successful replications and above the average power value in psych of 0.6. 

In [their subsequent fMRI experiment](http://www.jneurosci.org/content/35/34/11936.full), the power of the hypothesis tests for activation in response inhibition was 0.89 with an effect size of 0.65, and memory-associated structures was 0.83 / effect size 0.45.

476,"You should actually read the book *Loneliness* by John Caccioppo. He's one of the cofounders of the field of social neuroscience.

His and others' work on social isolation has helped us understand just how social our species is innately, and how much we need social connection for normal function. While we've known for a few decades now that the absence of close relationships that provide comfort in early life is associated with health problems and cognitive deficits like impaired immune functioning, impulse control problems, lower IQ, and more (the famous Harlow monkeys and Romanian orphanage studies established this), Caccioppo has expanded that work to elucidate what specific situations create harmful loneliness and what mind-body connections create those health and cognitive effects. For example, papers [1](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0110307), [2](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/531897cde4b0fa5080a9b19e/t/542082a5e4b07b5243b7766a/1411416741117/the-neuroendocrinology-of-social-isolation.pdf), and [3](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/531897cde4b0fa5080a9b19e/t/555601d9e4b0849a888ed857/1431699929973/toward-a-neurology-of-loneliness.pdf) say that people with few social connections and low perception of choice in the matter are loneliest, people with chronic *perceived* social isolation show greater stress response in the hypothalamic pituitary adrenocortical axis of the neuroendocrine system, and social isolation produces changes in brain structures that are involved in social activity, and that's a lot of them (which are also involved in other functions such as memory, reward, emotion regulation, etc. There's a figure in that paper with a summary of them.) 

It's also interesting to note the brain response to acute social pain, such as when you're rejected from a group activity or when you're broken up with by a significant other. Naomi Eisenberger's seminal work has been modeling the mechanisms of social pain in the brain, and has found that they are almost identical to physical pain. [One famous study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=eisenberger+lieberman+williams) that we casually just call ""Cyberball"" in the field had participants play a virtual game of toss with two other people, but what they didn't know was that the other two people were actually computers who were programmed to eventually stop passing the participant the ball. When scanned with fMRI during this, the participants showed greater activation in the anterior cingulate cortex that correlated with self-report of distress feelings, which parallels physical pain perception studies. There was also a negative correlation between distress and activity in the right ventral prefrontal cortex, suggesting this area may regulate the distress feelings expressed by the ACC and protect the person (hence why *perception* of social isolation is important, not just the objective measure of social activity). Eisenberger has also found that [taking acetaminophen medication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=eisenberger+tylenol) like tylenol can reduce feelings of social pain, further indicating that physical and social pain share similar neurocircuitry. And much like chronic physical pain, when social rejection pain becomes long term, you get negative health effects (as observed in the lonliness work). In fact, lonliness and social isolation is a greater health risk than poor diet, smoking, or lack of exercise. 

So basically, lonliness creates a chronic stress response that becomes harmful to the body over time. Additionally, it modulates the volume and activity of a diverse set of brain structures. ",2015-09-20 18:15:16+00:00,cv83ivr,1.0,t3_3ll6o9,84263,askscience

480,"There's even more info on replicating social psych studies specifically in their [related](https://replicationindex.wordpress.com/2015/09/03/comparison-of-php-curve-predictions-and-outcomes-in-the-osf-reproducibility-project-social-psychology-part-1/) post on the matter. 

I think it's important to reiterate the two main points this author made about why social psych replicated so terribly: 

- as opposed to other psych fields like cognitive that weren't too shabby in their replication performance, social psych often depends on between-subject designs because of the nature of the effect in question. This structure has lower power than within-subject, so you have to increase your sample size - an expensive endeavor.

- super importantly, there's a reward structure in place in the field that highly motivates social psychologists to publish frequent, new, sexy findings rather than spend their hard-won funding on replication. So even when people in the field want better practices, we can't really afford to as it stands. That's true all through psych but social may be especially prone to it, given how ripe for media attention some of the research subjects can be (e.g. halo effects). 

I think the field on some level has been aware of the replicability issue for a while, but changing the system is really tough. It's just not interesting to fund and publish replications when you've already read the original, unless its a surprising null effect for something previously well known. There are some efforts in place to address this so far - many journals now requiring confidence intervals and effect sizes as well as/instead of significance testing, for example, and my job this year in one of the departments listed with an upper 50's score is to replicate tons of our previous work (even though the study of ours in the project did replicate and this author seems to have classed our lab as cognitive, not social). But we'll need to get even more creative I believe in order to develop more incentives for replication.

Also for what it's worth, low replication isn't always a bad thing. 8% is pretty bad but [sometimes it's still important to study small effect sizes](http://rolfzwaan.blogspot.com/2013/06/the-tyrion-lannister-paradox-how-small.html) which won't replicate as often as larger ones due to random sampling error.

Another is replicability. While results being un-replicable doesn't automatically mean falsified (and usually just means not a strong effect), the process of trying to figure out why your replication failed can lead you to other red flags like missing records. 

Usually it's a combination of things like this.

485,"I was scanning through some older threads and noticed you didn't get any answers to this, so here's some quick information. I'm linking to as many non-paywall sources as I can find but if you want the original research papers I can try to dig them up too.

First off - it's difficult to definitively say ""abuse results in X happening in the brain"" because it's highly unethical to conduct causation experiments with phenomena like child abuse and neglect. The best we can do, then, is observe what happens in people who were already abused. When we have many of those correlational observations, we can be more confident that there really is a link. So here are the things we're pretty confident about so far. 

One of the biggest concerns, and one that my research is closest to, is the neurological effect of social rejection and isolation. I could give a lot of background on this but basically, humans are inherently social creatures, where social interaction is both highly rewarding and essential to normal brain development. Denying someone social acceptance is exceedingly painful and disastrous to one's health. In adults, lack of social support increases stress levels so much that it's a better predictor of death than smoking a pack a day (read *Social* by Dr. Matthew Lieberman for more social health info) and can significantly alter brain structure after just [a few days in solitary confinement](http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/02/18/3303721/solitary-confinement-dramatically-alter-brain-shape-just-days-neuroscientist-says/). When this social isolation occurs in childhood, which is a critical time of brain development, you get impairments in critical thinking, impulse control, mood regulation, memory, IQ, etc. due to shrinking brain areas such as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. [There's been a series of studies](http://news.sciencemag.org/brain-behavior/2015/01/childhood-neglect-erodes-brain) on severely neglected orphans in Romania that most famously support this connection.

Another neurological change we often see in people who were abused as children is an [increase in amygdala size](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24736182) and [reactivity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22979952), which is a structure that handles fear and threat response (it's more complicated than that but it's not necessary here to get into the details). Increased size and activity is known to associate with behaviors such as violence and criminality as well as mental health disorders like PTSD and depression, especially when combined with certain risk genes or the lack of protective genes.

Some other brain areas are affected as well, such as the HPA axis which controls the adrenal system, corpus callosum, cerebellum, and anterior cingulate cortex, but I know less about those specific effects so [here's a review](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3343716/) of the current neurobiological research on the link between early abuse and psychopathology. 

In summary, the brains of neglected/abused children are more likely to have poor behavior regulation and cognitive performance while the body is more likely to experience health problems related to chronic stress.

515,"Wazzup fellow Bruin.

To emphasize this point, OP, you've effectively had two chances to find research opportunities (undergrad and the thesis in your masters), but you chose alternate paths. A PhD is like saying ""I want to do research for a living,"" but it sounds like you don't want to do research since you passed those opportunities up. If you just want to work in the field in some capacity, a masters will get you far, so did you have a change of heart very recently and decide you really want to do research, or do you think it'll get you better job prospects? (It probably won't, unless you want to work in academia and do research). ",2015-08-20 05:06:43+00:00,cu96ghz,2.0,t1_cu94vp8,3552,gradadmissions
516,"well, this will just have to be a moment where we don't understand each other. My degree isn't just a fact about me, but is a step along a greater life progression (always cared a lot about school growing up, enjoy doing research, going into academia). So it's not just one commonality, like a sport or an interest in craft brewing. It's one of the largest experiences of my life. And while I wouldn't discount someone without a degree offhand (hypothetically because I've been dating the same guy for several years now), I'm definitely more attracted to a person who is more academically oriented like I am. Again, the degree is not the end in itself that I'm interested, but the lifestyle that tends to come with it in a person.

517,"Well for me, a degree signifies a lot more than intelligence (which like you said, it doesn't always signify). 

A graduate degree says something about the person's lifestyle, their passions, their priorities. I'm getting my own PhD right now, so I want to be with someone who I can talk about my research with, who is excited about that upcoming conference because they know it's a big deal, and who generally understands what I'm going through in that line of work. Also, we're likely to have stuff in common based on that degree - if not the same field/research topics, at least the experiences that come with graduate school, and the sense of motivation towards academic study.

In contrast, I don't think I could have a good lasting relationship with a high school drop out. Not at all because I think I'm superior in any way, but because our lives will have massively different focus and base of experience.

I'm only now entering my PhD so I don't have a lot of specific information, but I've been vocal about my hesitations to go into academia at the end of it so these are things I've been told by various professors and other grads:

- psychologists are valued data analysts, and lots of companies in many fields need people who are comfortable with statistics and know their way around computerized data management. Little chance to do your own research, though.

- large tech companies like Google and Intel hire psychologists and neuroscientists for researching things like brain-computer interfacing, consumer experience, potential future tech markets, etc. Usually needs a lot of programming experience but sometimes it doesn't.

- there are various start up companies popping up using social, cognitive, and I/O psych for improving the workplace in various capacities. One of my friends and former TA just signed on with one in Boston and was contacted by several in San Francisco. The one she joined is called iMotions, developing eye tracking devices that are more amenable to diverse researchers and environments. Another that she interviewed at was Kintla, which consults with companies to reduce stress in the workplace. I don't know what the others were called but she found them at psych conferences, so if you still attend those it's a good place to look for companies.

- consulting. Didn't get more specific than that so I dunno.

However, there's substantial cause for concern about health hazards associated with fragrances. Currently there are several thousand ingredients that can make up a fragrance concoction, and they're considered trade secrets so those ingredients aren't required to be disclosed. However, a number of these ingredients, particularly phthalates, have been associated with hormonal imbalance (like early puberty, fetus deformation, obesity) as well as cancer. Other concerns involve contact skin allergies.  Some of these ingredients are also bioaccumulative, so small doses can still be unsafe if used over long periods of time.

As to cooperation with the CIA, the report mentions the APA closely interacted with the organization in order to curry favor and develop a close relationship, but it doesn't look like the APA knew (besides the few implicated psychologists) the support they were giving the CIA was directly assisting torture programs: 

""Despite these extensive interactions and APA’s clear desire to please the CIA, it appears that the actual actions that APA took during this period that may have assisted the CIA in its interrogation program were limited to putting on a small number of conferences with the CIA for academics and key national security psychologists (including Hubbard, Mitchell, and Jessen). It may be that the discussions at these conferences were of great value to CIA psychologists like Mitchell and Jessen, who were alternating between (a) interrogating and waterboarding detainees in secret CIA sites abroad and (b) having meetings and conferences in the U.S. on topics that might assist them in attempting to extract information through torture and other abusive interrogation techniques. But we did not find evidence that current APA officials like Mumford and Brandon were read into or were aware in any significant way of the CIA’s interrogation program, which was classified, or had any meaningful knowledge of what Mitchell, Jessen, or other CIA personnel involved in interrogations were doing.""

594,"That's fair.

However it's also important to note that women sports will have a different aesthetic of their own, not just one that's inferior to the men's expression. I think it will be a good day when society recognizes the aesthetic and skill specific to women's sports and then talks about the highest achievements in that rather than constantly comparing male and female teams. (Helloooooo more funding for women's sports). It'd be like comparing Gaelic football to rugby (sort of extreme example but whatever it's illustrative). Similar games, but they're both so highly developed with specific skills and strategic focuses. No one would expect those teams to face off to prove their awesomeness because the teams are playing two different games. I'm not a big soccer fan so I don't know the extent of differences between men's and women's games, but I've played a lot of volleyball and this is certainly true between strategy for men's and women's teams there. A good men's spike is different than a good women's spike, playing a men's defense position would be stupid in a women's game, etc. 

Also, I avoid the comments in many subs for topics I enjoy because there are just too many people who take the comparison too far and it's hard to always brace myself against that. By that I mean, it's not about preferring the male aesthetic for those people, but a clear indication of how women's competitions are pointless to watch, how women are a weak sex if their top teams can't even beat a men's club team, etc.

So with the hair donut, after cutting it so I could straighten it out into a tube, I put it aside and then sectioned off the hair on my head that I wanted to form the braid. For this style the sides were individual panels forming their own braids, so the hair that would make the big braid was a wide strip down the middle of my head. I tied the side hair out of the way and then parted the wide strip down the middle. Now I covered the foam donut with extension hair to hide it better, and then bobby pinned it to my head over that center part so that the to-be-braided hair flowed out from underneath it on either side. I also pinned it slightly farther back from my front hairline so that front hair could hide the front of the foam tube. I took that front hair, split it into three, and started braiding over the top and down the length of the foam tube, adding in the hair hanging loose on the sides as I did so making a French braid.

620,"Sexism doesn't have to operate as a blunt instrument where every woman is hated regardless of context. In this situation, Victoria had a good relationship with the user base and there is nothing to hate her for. With Ellen on the other hand, she's made decisions that people disagree with and as lots of research has shown concerning women in the workplace, female mistakes are interpreted as more damaging or more reflective of negative personal qualities (e.g ""she's not qualified for this"" vs. ""she messed up on that thing"") than when men make those mistakes or unsavory decisions. Why this happens is likely because women in executive roles are breaking gender norm, so the social approval of their position is tenuous to start with.  

So Victoria hasn't done anything to incur the wrath of reddit, but Ellen has made executive actions that people disagree with. Given her gender, this wrath is likely greater than it would be if she were a male executive. Now, it's always important to remember that group statistics shouldn't be relied on for decisions about individual cases, especially in complex behavior like subtle sexism, but it's important to keep in mind as something that very well might be taking place.

622,"My personal opinion is very anti-Brazilian treatment or any of the other related brands. From a customer standpoint, it essentially has you break your hair's protein structure and reassemble it, which won't be as strong in the long run. The shine eventually goes away (or isn't even a part of the treatment, and is instead applied secondarily with a glossing agent or something like that which may or may not be effective), and then the damage is evident. To some people that's worth it for the effects they get in the first week of the treatment and will just keep going to get it renewed, but for others that accumulating damage is undesirable.

I'm more against the procedure from the hairstylist standpoint, as repeated exposure to the airborne chemicals in the treatment (namely formaldehyde, which definitely IS present in formaldehyde-free treatments because those simply contain precursors that become formaldehyde during the heating process) is linked to respiratory problems and cancer. There was a class action lawsuit against the blowout brands a few years ago on this matter, though I'm not sure if it has been resolved/what the outcome is. 

Those are the reasons I would never get a treatment and why I would warn my friends against it. 

Edit: I think you replied but I'm on my phone so I'm not sure.

My problems come in the form of social anxiety spiraling into depression, and stress impacts that progression and its intensity a lot, so he's helped me address that in a holistic way that I really enjoy. I have an antidepressant prescription, but he's also given me CBT to help me identify thoughts that lead to negative feelings and behaviors, be with them without feeling the emotion I used to get, and letting them go. I've also started mindfulness training to help with this, mantra meditation to get better at controlling negative emotions when they do pop up, and he gave me a lot of resources on improving my diet and physical health (as a lot of new research is finding that gut flora impacts brain function, plus what we already know about food and exercise impacting hormone balances). Finally I feel more motivated to make all these changes because he's an academic like me (continually reading new psychiatric research and publishing books) and so I trust his insight into my problems.

624,"Definitely agree with you on nomothetical and idiographic inference and on the limitations of significance testing. It's also worth noting though that the effect size calculated in a study is not the true size of the effect in the entire population, but an estimation of it. And if you have a small sample size, the confidence interval of that estimation is massive (like, for n=64 and measured Cohen's d = 0.5, the true effect size could lie anywhere between 0.15 and 0.85). The CI is around a full 1 Cohen's d for n=30, and definitely below 80% power. So even if an effect size of 0.6 or something was reported in a small sample size, it's still good to be wary of the published point estimate, as it might not be near the true size of the effect or it might even be a Type I error. The best thing you want is a large population with high power and notable effect size, or a series of study replications with small sample sizes so the meta-analysis will have a more precise ES estimate.

640,"Well, both.

Yeah, super unhelpful answer! But what I mean by that is:

I'm in the beauty tutorial genre. And there are certain trends involved in that area that are generally immensely popular. Then, there is my own style in terms of content (I do hairstyling based on fantasy/sci fi/historical movies and shows). If these popular videos types and my style don't overlap, I don't make them because I won't be convincing to the audience and I will be bored out of my mind making that video (e.g, ""get ready with me"" videos). However, within my style there is obviously room for many more specific videos, and so where popular trends meet those restrictions, I tend to make those videos first and save my purely ""what I want to do"" videos for later (for instance I'll do videos for very popular franchises like Game of Thrones or Hunger Games and release those to coincide with the release of a new season/movie). My channel hasn't grown super fast like some beauty channels have because of that niche I wish to stick with, but I'm happy with what growth has happened (25k over two years) and especially happy with the loyalty it has cultivated in my existing followers.
