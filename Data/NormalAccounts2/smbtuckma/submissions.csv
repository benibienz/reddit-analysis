[Alfred Kwok](http://imgur.com/a/AxI8r) was scheduled to make a solo trek out around Deerhorn this weekend, and was supposed to return Monday. As of Tuesday evening, he hasn't been heard from. A search with helicopter and ground volunteers started today. Were any of you in the area this weekend, and may have possibly seen him? 

These are the things known so far: 

- His car was found in the parking lot at the trailhead (Onion Valley trail head I think? [this](http://imgur.com/a/T9YK4) is the search map)

- Got a permit from the ranger station on Friday morning, possibly seen with a climbing partner but registered as a single hiker. Said he planned to camp at kearsage lake the first night, then go to bubbs creek. 

- Last Thursday, told a friend ""scrambling up Deerhorn Peak on Sat"" 

- Told another friend earlier that he was ""tempted by the NE ridge""

- One ranger has a possible memory of him discussing East Lake 

If anyone has any info, or could keep an eye out if you're hiking in the area, that would be wonderful! ",Mountaineering,Was anyone around Deerhorn Mountain this weekend?

I'm not a shopkeeper myself, but I run a moderately sized Youtube channel and I just completed a collaboration with several Etsy artists. The experience was really rewarding for all of us, so I thought I'd share the info with you guys in case you want to do something similar. 

It started out as a giveaway that I wanted to host on my channel marking a growth milestone. I've done sponsored giveaways before from large companies (I'm in the beauty genre, so hair product companies mainly), but after a while that stopped feeling too meaningful to me. I've been a fan of Etsy for years, so I thought I'd reach out to my favorite shops and ask if they would donate items to the giveaway in return for review and promotion from me. 

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNesc1ISgqs) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAW7tH_NE-s) video are the results of that. I worked with the shop owners to pick products that they were willing to donate and that I thought were most appealing to my subscribers, I hosted a contest to win these prizes, and then I dedicated a second video discussing in depth why these shops are valuable for people to know about. 

Since uploading those, the shop owners have told me that they've seen a large spike in traffic and favorites added, and one shop owner shared specific sales numbers with me and there was like a 500% increase in sales the day after the second video went up. I'm not sure how long that benefit will last for them (that traffic was from my most dedicated viewers who watch new videos in the first few days, and I'm not sure how engaged future viewers will be), but everyone was very appreciative and happy with the results so far. Plus for me, I got new exposure for myself when they shared the video on their respective social media and I didn't have to spend money on products for the giveaway :) 

Depending on your genre and prices, this may or may not be feasible for you. But if it is, I recommend reaching out to Youtube channels and other large social media accounts (e.g. Instagram, Vine) and pitching this sort of collaboration. We get proposals like this all the time from companies, but for me it's more personally rewarding to work with a smaller artist like myself and I'm sure there are others out there like me. I'd recommend pitching to people you already organically follow and love, because you'll understand each other better when you're naturally drawn to each others' content and style. I also recommend maybe starting with smaller accounts (less than 50k subscribers) to figure out the procedure, and then pitch to other larger persons when you're comfortable with the process and have a ""collaboration resume"" to show off. Finally, you can get creative with the nature of the collaboration - maybe you'll offer discounts at your store or a product designed specifically for this purpose, and maybe they'll make an entertainment video or how-to featuring your product rather than a review. There's lots of options!

Social media sponsorship is a multi-million business now, and most large social media accounts are involved in it in some capacity. Including Etsy artists seems like it would be a more authentic and personable development in that field, so hopefully you'll consider it!

Hi all!

About a year ago, our sub worked with /r/artsortie to produce some [awesome](https://www.reddit.com/r/FancyFollicles/comments/1zfkdc/fancy_follicles_art_i_hope_you_enjoy/) handmade [artwork](https://www.reddit.com/r/FancyFollicles/comments/1zgc6h/i_also_made_some_art_inspired_by_your_lovely_hair/). Now, we'd like to give you the opportunity to do it again!

How it works: This time we'll be partnering with /r/SketchDaily. They are a theme-a-day art subreddit where members create hand made art inspired by the current theme. This coming Saturday, their theme will be our subreddit and the pictures you share on it. 

So if you would like to be drawn, **please post your pictures here for artist reference**! We decided not to make the rest of the sub available for drawing in case some people don't want their picture recreated. If you do, be sure to include all the pictures you want to be available in the comment section of this post before Saturday. The more the merrier! 

On Saturday we'll come back here with a link to all their drawings, so you can see how they interpreted your beautiful hair :) Maybe you can even work out a portrait delivery! 

Now go post post post! And we'll see you this weekend. ",FancyFollicles,"Get your fancy selves drawn! We've scheduled an art collaboration with /r/SketchDaily for Saturday, August 15",http://www.reddit.com/r/FancyFollicles/comments/3gqrvg/get_your_fancy_selves_drawn_weve_scheduled_an_art/

Hopefully it's alright to post this here - there's a phone number in the link but hopefully that's not considered doxxing in this case. My friend's college roommate and her two sisters went backpacking in the Tetons last week around Jackson, but have not returned or made contact in more than 7 days. They were last physically seen in Moose, and their cell phone records last show activity in Hoback Junction on June 30. 

Would you have seen them or their car (picture and plate number in the above imgur link) in the last week by any small chance? Or would you know people in the Jackson area you could share this information with? 

The last info I heard about the search was that officials are searching the Granite Creek Area. Grand Teton National Park has checked all their trailheads and will continue to keep checking and asking if anyone recognizes their photos. The US Forest Service is also helping to check, and they are sending additional notices to include states between Wyoming and Illinois. 

If you do know or see anything, please call the number in the link or the Sheriff's number. 

Thanks!
