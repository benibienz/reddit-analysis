0,"vocal tracks packed with emotion and intricate acid house rhythm that builds into a void of ambiance at the halfway point, which gives way into a span of high-energy 130 BPM beats that later die back down to the ""end of this journey"" infectious disco vibe.

""A Made Up Sound"" by Source Direct... I could see this going well during a live set with the piece ""Black Rainbow""... Same sort of inaudible vocal style and flowing ambiance, but subdivides that beat and adds some extra interest into the mix.

3,"That bassline in ""Self-Portrait"" is freaking captivating haha, I love when you can't exactly discern the tones but you are still forced to perceive the musical line, very hypnotic. Also I'm really digging this acid bass in Black Rainbow, I wonder what this would sound like mixed in with some Source Direct drum n' bass or something.
