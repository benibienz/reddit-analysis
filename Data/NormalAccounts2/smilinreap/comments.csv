669,"At that age every relationship feels like the world, especially when you don't have many other relationships or prior relationships. I have many anti-social friends and there is one trait I have noticed. Every single one of them fell in love with every single girl to join our group. They all said the same things to me after being rejected and eventually pushing the girls out of the group. ""I was in love with her, and she was friendlier than other girls do, so I thought the feeling was semi-mutual"", the girl(s) got more attractive the more they hung out eventually they liked/loved her, many more things. The most common thing that they always brought up, when the girl wasn't around and we drank together was how much they wanted to sleep with her and it's the libido that forced out the confessions. Most of these girls were okay hanging out with us again after 1-3 months, but the more shy ones tend to eventually separate from the group out of fear. Two of my friends are openly the stalker type though and will follow every post they make on any social site and treat anyone they may like with passive-aggressiveness such as comments to me within ear shot of the girl. If you want to be friends with her again, try texting her again in a month or so, or once you are in a relationship with someone else. I don't know a whole lot about either of you, but I don't think religion has much to do with your situation, rather one of the many excuses she could have brought up to try and let you down gently. You probably mean a lot to her and it hurts her if not the same amount it hurts you, however she may have other friends who can gently help her fill the pain/emptiness you left. Once she feels better you can text her again, but if you do it while she is still hurting, your only pushing her further. My main advice is try joining a club at your college or one that you found via google. Once you have more friends it will be easier to sort out your feelings and you will feel a lot less pain.

If you want advice that's fine but it sounds like that's not what your looking for. There is another Reddit if you're focused on suicide, I don't have enough life experience to help with that, nor should I attempt to because let's be honest i'd probably make it worse. I have seen homeless people carry on each day living off of what little the world hands them. The fact you have a job means you're worth more, and each day you work is just another day of work experience to help you get a job you would actually enjoy. School is not a requirement nor a must. Just get one full time job and one part time job. Build as much work experience as you can until you can work upwards at one of those jobs or go where you want. I have seen people work at a ware-house I frequently work at move up to manager just by working there for 7 years straight. I have seen people go from cashier at K-mart to store  manager with 0 school. Instead of caring so much about your present just keep thinking in 3 years I will have a better position, more money each month, and my friends mom or whoever I live with will also feel the extra income. But if you don't want to wait until you build up experience, until you can make life for those who struggled for you easier. all I can say is it does get easier so long as you keep on working or going to school, it's a misconception in today's generations that both are required.

700,"Okay I got this, a friend had a very similar experience. He had a presidential scholarship to go to UOP (priciest school around for us, roughly 20x the state college tuition). He did okay but once his scholarship wore off (lasted only 1 semester) he didnt buy books and failed all of his classes (straight f's). He tried again and failed 80% (4/5) of his classes with an F and 1 D. He dropped out and went to a community college, (Delta). He owes over 5 grand still, however as long as you are still going to college, all of your college debt from any college is frozen (no interest can build up, usually). If you got the kind of debt which still builds up, I got good news. It  still won't affect your financial aid. My friend gets the normal financial aid I got which was roughly 1.3k a semester and all of his classes are paid for before he gets the check. You may get put on academic probation or warning, but all this means is if you continue to get straight f's in community college for more than 2 semesters in a row (or just a really low gpa around 1.0 or lower) they will kick you off from financial aid until you get good grades for 1-2 semesters. The college has to give you transcripts whether you owe money or not, but if you don't want to go back to your old college for personal reasons every college has some systems in place to help. You can either A) request an online transcript (will cost roughly 20-50$), B) Talk to your counselor (unsure about your college, but my counselor waved the transcript fee and did the process of request for me), or C) Call your old school and ask them to fax the transcript to your new school, if they give you flak simply talk to a counselor and the counselor will be forced to go through a kind of lengthy process but usually reimburses you with financial aid for any semesters you were unable to get it for before this.
