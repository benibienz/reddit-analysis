**Fishing Questions**

~~1. Is being killed while fishing common? It happened twice in a row so I have since only been fishing in exhausted resource safe zones.~~

~~2. Is the cash shop/event item which makes repairs cheaper and 50% slower durability usage usable on the fishing poles?~~

~~3. For long-term fishing purposes is the epher rod the best (while at work, gym, sleeping).~~

4. Are boats worth investing in for fishing if I have very little management time?

5. Is there an armor set with rec fishing gems to run for profit (fishing speed/quality/luck/durabiltiy, anything but increased exp gain).

6. Does node level affect fishing results?

7. Has anyone done the math on how much afk fishing (hours) is required for Epher to be better than Balenos rod?

**Production/Processing Questions**

1. Is it possible to have enough production queue to produce/process for 8+ hours while asleep or at work?

2. If #1 is possible would profit be possible from this (at least 200k per hour) with the lowest tier of processing skill, I am not asking for any recipes or specific productions but my in game name is Smilinreap and i'm on the server Uno if someone wants to pm a not so important or well known recipe for profit that I can try. I'd offer to give a % of profit or a cash shop item but the game doesn't allow either..

**Generic Questions**

1. Any other AFK options? Or how to play the game AFK guides? (I'm aware of strength, breath, training, horse leveling)

~~2. Will they slowly but surely increase the silver pricing of cash shop items? They seem dramatically under priced on the AH.~~

3. Alchemy - Is it worth investing for an afk player like me (possible luck stat or ?).

The upvotes were more of a, ""This is a fair point, relates highly to OP's post"". Now the upvotes are purely based on whether the reader liked/disliked said opinion. Also if anyone has a site like Reddit but slightly more moderated i'd love to give it a shot. I really enjoy reddit, but now I can't even read the comments and discussions for current news/viral videos because all I will read is insults, sexual jokes, or some other unrelated comment.

Edited in* Thanks for the responses, I have discovered the defaults have changed to be a little more toxic (in my opinion, not factual), and the subreddits I originally joined while small that have grown are also gaining toxicity rather fast (as to where there originally was none) as the subreddits grow. This does not seem to be true for hobby subreddits, and after making changes to my subscriptions reddit is once again rather pleasent to surf the front page. 

*In short* Changing my subscriptions filtered out a large amount of toxicity.",TheoryOfReddit,"Why is reddit gradually getting more toxic, especially in the comments for the front page stuff?",https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/4yz81u/why_is_reddit_gradually_getting_more_toxic/

Here is where it gets very tricky. Two more restrictions.             
1. I have watched most anime (old, new, 70% of what's out there). So if the manga has a anime counterpart, please do not rec it unless it is vividly different than the anime or continues past it a good amount like air gear (which I now know why the anime stopped).                                                                                                 
2. It must be completed or extremely long (I am looking for things to power read, not check up on weekly, thanks).

It should be noted I was raised in a pretty terrible environment and can honestly say I had some of the worst parents up until the age of 21, when one of my parents found god. The other parent left the state in order to straighten his life out and now raises horses for a living. I will list an emotional scar that I feel is most relevant but may not be.                              
About me: I am 23, I currently work and go to school (last year then accounting BA woot woot). I have had the same girlfriend since highschool (little over 5 years now, madly in love, never cheated or tried [and she doesn't use reddit, this is all truth]). I am a very outgoing person and decent looking. My self confidence is good and I will add anything you guys ask me to, Let us get on with it, shall we? 
                                                                                              
1. When I hear people talking in another room but can not understand them, my mind always assumes they are arguing. I have many scars with my parents arguing and waking me up (shaking me awake and then pulling me into the living room to use me) at night throwing stuff and attacking each other physically and verbally, putting me (physically holding me) in the middle as protection and to prove a point to one another. This one is probably one of the worst things I experience, because it sinks my heart and I lost the fun in what I am doing, such as a movie or game. 
                                                                                
2. I have a hard time sleeping at night and wake up excessively easy. When I was younger people have broken into my house (usually friends of my dad) to rob and/or harass us. Because of this every time I hear the smallest noise at night I wake up full of adrenaline and feel an impulse to check it out.
                                                                                         
I have more issues, but the top two take major priority as they are the one causing me the most issues at the moment. I will answer any post(s) honestly. Also if I can change this post to anonymous that would be  great, if not, it is fine as well. None of my friends or family use Reddit.",askpsychology,"Hi, I am an emotional grenade and am looking for someone to explain how to lower or accept these things.",http://www.reddit.com/r/askpsychology/comments/3fz620/hi_i_am_an_emotional_grenade_and_am_looking_for/

1. What are some cheap funded HC builds now a days I can use to fund my expirementations (I like to have one char I know can clear, to fund my others).                                   
2. Did that exiled masters expansion add anything major (for loot or stats? or is it all mainly for that housing type system)?                                               
3. Which leagues have more players atm, standard or HC?
