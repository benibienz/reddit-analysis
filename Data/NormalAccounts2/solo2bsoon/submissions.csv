I'm scheduled to meet with the lawyer in the morning at 9am for the first tiimeand I don't know what questions to ask.  Wife moved out 3 months ago and recently stopped trying all together to talk or go to counseling.  We have a 1 year old daughter and I do not want to give up rights.  I want holidays and split visitation but the wife will not let our daughter spend the night with me unsupervised.  I have 30 minutes with a lawyer tomorrow and I need to know what questions to ask.  Help please so I can calm down adn stay composed.  The wife wiped out the house last week and took everything she wanted that we accrued together (lawnmower, furniture, all the baby stuff).  She inadvertently admitted she spoke with a lawyer 2 weeks ago. 

FYI I have never abused her and the reason for divorce is because she abandoned me and all she cares about is staying on my insurance while she lives at her parents. she says the reason isn't working is because I hid bills from her and that she cant trust me to tell the truth.

What do you ask the lawyer in 30 minutes time to maximum outcome?
