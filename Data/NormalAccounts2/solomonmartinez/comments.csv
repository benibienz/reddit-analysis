5,"I supported Bernie with cash and time. But I wonder what “smoking gun” he is referring to with this statement, because in 20,000 emails released by Wikileaks, I’ve yet to see any strong case of outright wrongdoing or “rigging” of the election: “We said that the Clinton campaign was heavily influencing what the DNC was doing regarding debates, and that’s exactly what had been happening.”  
 
I guess, like many of his followers, if you “interpret” a few words like what you imagined, it MUST be so. 
 
Trump team tried to fly this false flag, too, and the Poltifact fact checkers also said “no smoking gun.” They wrote, “Zero emails in the WikiLeaks DNC archive involve anything about the scheduling of these planned debates. There is also no proof of the Clinton campaign having any say over the dates.” 
 
Perhaps Bernie’s been smoking what he claimed (incorrectly) is putting everyone everyone in jail for using. I personally am sick of hearing about Hillary’s “damn emails” because they’re really quite boring, even if you actually read the worst 10 emails, or .05% of them. My response is more like “That’s it?”

Why not make the United States income tax rate 0% for publicly-traded companies as to which no 13D is in place. Also, provide that dividends and capital gains for any stockholder of any such entity will be taxed at 25% regardless how long the stockholder held the stock. 

In the case of companies that are not publicly-traded (or which are controlled by someone who has filed a 13D), the 0% rate would not be available because it would be too easy to manipulate earnings and dividends to suit taxation strategies of controlling shareholder(s). 

Congress would have to give publicly-traded companies the ability to protect themselves from those who might seek 13D level of control as a means to influence taxation of any publicly-traded entity.",2016-10-23 18:15:59+00:00,d94i01d,1.0,t3_58yltt,16249.0,politics

17,"I am beyond stunned and outraged that Julian Assange and Wikileaks (reportedly, in collusion with the Russian government) have made it their mission to do as much damage to HRC as they can - before the election. When Assange was on Real Time with Bill Maher several months ago, I got the impression that he was a supporter of Bernie Sanders.

His/Their number one focus on exposing HRC - while doing nothing to shed light on Trump's corrupt business/personal dealings - is a clear indicator that they never really supported Bernie Sanders in the first place. That was just a ruse to manipulate people into believing they were believers in a Progressive agenda.

Any real Bernie supporter would NEVER purport to defend or assist Bernie by exposing HRC’s questionable practices without first verifying and validating this information. And there is no way to verify the veracity of the dumped documents before the election is held on November 8th. This, in turn, makes Wikileaks look like an amateur, conspiracy-heavy organization that is more interested in opinion than it is in facts, and getting people ""riled-up""/reactionary.

With the recent - and ongoing - release of HRC's emails, I NOW understand that Assange is a Trump supporter who would like to see the United States become yet another fascist/dictatorial country. And - if that is NOT his main objective - he has a shitload to learn about supporting a candidate and encouraging an improved, more efficient democratic process in these United States!",2016-10-19 19:12:20+00:00,d8z5he6,1.0,t3_586xu8,73201.0,worldnews

First, in an attempt to use the “massive loss of jobs” appeal, they warn authorities that closing down their operations would mean a significant loss of jobs for their “5,000 employees.” They lied. In their annual reports in 2013 and 2014, which can be accessed through their own website, they candidly stated that they had “a lean and highly productive organization” of 300 employees (250 in 2011). How they suddenly ballooned to 5,000 employees in one a half years is mind-boggling, to say the least – unless they will admit that they did their massive expansion during this period. Then again, they would have to show where and how this expansion took place. Truth be told, this is a canard peddled to authorities in order to have them take pity on the hapless “employees”.
Second, it now portrays itself as just a “provider” to PAGCOR stating in a press interview, “PhilWeb is merely a software provider to Pagcor for its network of e-Games outlets,” he said.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Trump

&gt;Frederick Trump (born Friedrich Trump, March 14, 1869 – March 30, 1918) was a German-born American businessman. He was the father of Elizabeth, Fred, and John G. Trump and grandfather of businessman Donald Trump.&lt;
""Soon after returning German authorities determined that Trump had emigrated from Germany to avoid his tax and military-service obligations, and he was labeled a draft dodger.[4]:98[13]
On December 24, 1904 the Department of Interior announced an investigation to expel Trump from the country.
Officially, they found that he had violated the Resolution of the Royal Ministry of the Interior number 9916, a 1886 law that punished emigration to North America to avoid military service with the loss of German citizenship.[4]:99
For several months, he unsuccessfully petitioned the government to allow him to stay.[4]:100 He and his family finally returned to New York on June 30, 1905.[4]:102""!

Of course, the planets will still be generated within certain constraints to prevent extreme results, such as a planet with giant deformed glitches that are larger than the planet themselves, so inevitably those 18 quintillion planets will end up looking very similar to each other.

Sanders didn’t accomplish anything other than being a temporary effective leader for the huge group of people who believe in progressive ideals. The minute he endorses Clinton we’re done with him. Now that Warren (and soon Sanders) have sold out, the next major progressive leader’s first pledge will be to not sell out. That will be a requirement. And that can only happen outside the Democratic party.

Introduced in the 1970s as a management tool for aquaculture farms and sewage treatment facilities in Louisiana, the fish escaped into the Mississippi River system during flooding and has been making its way north ever since.

As well , they were imported live for Asians who eat Carp but only buy them LIVE. Some were dumped in the river when deemed ""unsuitable"".

Either way, this could be an horrendous problem. They are not sport fish and they are not edible delicacies at their adult weight of 100lbs+ but THEY eat their own weight in food almost every day.

She represents status quo with Wall Street and the military industrial complex.

We need a candidate who is running for US President to benefit the people. That candidate is Bernie. Hillary and Trump each want the presidency for themselves. They support the corporations and the super wealthy no matter what their campaign rhetoric says.

Bernie offers us the chance to embrace a new vision and a new direction.If you want a president who will do the best for the struggling young adults and the middle class,
Bernie’s program deals with the very crucial issues for our time and Bernie is the candidate who has the solutions. We need to support universal health care, education and getting rid of big donors from politics. We must reject endless wars, lobbyist-driven legislation, the offshoring of jobs and corporate tax havens. If Bernie is President, we will have a leader who truly believes in these priorities. His integrity and leadership as president is the best way to move us in the directions this country needs.

Bernie’s campaign is not about party affiliation, but about a revolution of everyday Americans against the corrupt elite political and corporate establishment. That is why we believe supporting Bernie Sanders for president is so important. No Establishment candidate will ever topple the wealthy elite regime. It has to come from a united people. If we truly want a better future, we must be part of the Bernie Sanders and people for the American Revolution of 2016. Together, we can re-strengthen the middle class and democracy.

Plenty of private sector or retired conservatives we can get back in the fight (i.e. Gingrich or someone like that, although I'd suggest Gingrich run for Speaker of the House against Paul Ryan since you don't technically have to be a member to be elected).

Although in the end I think Trump will have to pick someone that negates the woman card or race card, preferably someone that negates both. So it's very likely Trump will pick Gov. Susanna Martinez (I think his recent attack on her is a brilliant diversion to make the media not cover her as a potential VP so he surprise the public with her at the convention).

164,"

Using this line of ""logic"", America's entry into World War II was a massive overreach as well. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, our Pacific naval fleet was excessively hobbled with our aircraft carriers the only ships spared heavy damage and loss from the air attack. They were out on patrol looking for the Japanese fleet at the time of the attack. Over 2400 American service personnel were killed in the attack and many times that number were wounded. Our air forces were also heavily damaged by the attack on Hickam Field. On top of all this, the decision to enter the war effort in the European Theater first strapped American industry and production to the absolute limit, especially after the draft started pulling out thousands of front-line workers from assembly lines for new planes, ships, tanks, trucks, jeeps, bombs, ammunition, mess kits, parachutes etc. And all of this cost a great deal of money that we did not have in the Treasury, sparking an unending series of War Bond rallies all over the country during the entire wartime effort.

Diplomacy didn't work in WW2, so there was no real alternative for the country, especially after the Pear Harbor attacks. Any country that is placed on a war footing must overreach if they wish to survive as a nation, a process that is not always guaranteed. Again, we get sloppy slanted histrionics from a leader who knows nothing about wars or how to fight them.

Mr Geoghegan’s intervention contrasts sharply with the comments of current HSBC boss Stuart Gulliver, who threatened to move hundreds of jobs to Paris if we leave. The threat has since been dropped.

In his report, written with independent risk consultant Peter Udale, Mr Geoghegan also hit out at Bank of England boss Mark Carney for his one-sided scaremongering on Brexit.

‘Unlike the French, who have a veto over EU legislation relating to agriculture, the UK has no such control over a key part of its economy – financial services,’ said the report.

It also claimed the proposed EU ‘financial transaction tax’ on banks could cost UK taxpayers an extra £4billion a year in higher interest rates. Even if we do not sign up to it, Brussels could still force us to collect taxes under what is called ‘EU enhanced co-operation’.",2016-05-28 11:39:25+00:00,d3mv11d,1.0,t3_4lbmub,67878.0,worldnews

208,"For sexual denial 
 
If your wife is un-submissive in the sexual arena and chronically denies your sexual advances (without legitimate medical or psychological reasons for doing so) then perhaps that upcoming trip you were going to take her on gets canceled. Maybe that wardrobe upgrade your wife was looking forward to gets downsized or canceled. The Bible says a man has to supply his wife with clothing, but it does not say it has to be the expensive clothing she wants! 
 
Some of these disciplinary procedures may affect the family as a whole, but sometimes it is necessary to do this in an attempt to bring your wife to repentance. 
God not only give husbands the power to discipline their wives, but he also gives them to the duty to do this. Men should not discipline their wives out some sort of power trip or prideful arrogance. Instead men should discipline their wives from a place of love in order to bring about holiness and order in their homes. Even if a wife rejects her husband’s discipline as Israel did God as her husband – he should still discipline her and pray that God will bring his wife to repentance.

236,"

The only reason any ""market"" is ""efficient"" is because ""prices"" reflect ""costs"". A system where prices do not reflect costs cannot be efficient and cannot even persist long term.

In ecosystems, commensal organisms provided each other with goods and services, much like a market. Oak trees provide squirrels with nuts to sustain a stable population of squirrels, and squirrels supply seed distribution services. Flowers provide bees with nectar and pollen, and bees provide plants with pollen distribution services. Herbivore species provide predators with biomass and predators provide prey species with “weak and sick individual” culling services.

An ecosystem will (over time), evolve to be “efficient”, in that the “price” (in terms of substrates) of providing a service will reflect the “cost” of sustaining the biomass of the species providing those goods and services.

If providing a “good and service” costs more biomass than its consumer can provide, then the consumer goes extinct. If the “good and service” costs less biomass, then the consumer can expand and other providers of that “good and service” can participate in providing it too.

It is the balancing of prices and costs that makes markets efficient. Markets can only function when there are no significant unpriced externalities.

In the case of internet payments, the large credit card companies have a monopoly and through that monopoly have set barriers to entry so that cheaper alternatives can't enter the market.

The ability to do internet micropayments would essentially eliminate credit card companies. If credit card companies can already capture a few percent of online commerce, that is a gigantic profit stream that can be used to block competitors.

Phone companies already do “micropayment equivalents” (keeping track of customer data, phone calls and bill appropriately). There are no “technical” barriers to a real micropayment system, just business barriers.

I have tried to refrain from making this about Socialism,as I think that most people have in this country, including the media; but Bernie's ""us against them, over the top"" approach against corporations and financial institutions- even going so far as to call Wall St. itself, a fraud- is largely about Socialism.[ Socialism is not a pejorative. It is the name of a socio-economic system , with pros and cons, regardless of the type. We have even borrowed and incorporated a couple of concepts from it that most people see as good and  reasonable-mainly related to "" the social safety net""- such as making sure that people who fall upon hard times have a way for their basic needs to be met].

While I do believe that corporations should give workers their piece of the pie in decent wages and benefits for helping to make their companies a success  and pay their fair share in taxes, and  not be able to ""play"" the system and benefit from tax loopholes while having all or the majority of their operations abroad at the expense of U.S. workers, to hamstring businesses and the financial sector would damage the economy and cause less hirings [ which have picked up] and more firings.[ And tax incentives for businesses that hire here more would actually be helpful].Businesses/management and workers have a built-in tension in their relationship, but can't be enemies, or the economy will be destroyed.

In Germany, 80,000 MW of wind and solar have been added to the grid but they have not cut their greenhouse gas emissions in 6 years. Not since 2009. Per capita, German CO2 emissions are nearly 2% more than in 2009 [ref 2]. German electricity emits about 10 times more CO2 than nuclear powered French electricity. Consequently, [ref 2], German per capita CO2 emissions are far higher than French. In 2014, per capita CO2 emissions (tons) were:
France: 5
Germany: 9.3

Solar is intermittent because it produces nothing at night and far less in winter. Between latitude 50° and 59°, in UK, June/July solar is about 10 times December/January.
