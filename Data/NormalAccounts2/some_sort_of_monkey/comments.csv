When I sat the old Intermediate 2 level in 2007 we had a section on ""Scottish immigrants and exiles (1830 to 1930 I think?)"" and a lot of the immigrants part was about Irish people coming over especially during the famine. It covered a lot of issues around the famine and I even had to write a long essay titled something like ""To what extent did the repelling of the corn laws exacerbate the Irish famine"" where I had to go into detail about the causes and what was done to help and what wasn't done/could have been done. I don't think it sugar coating things too much (although if you wanted to read a political slant to it I guess it was more anti-sectarianism is Scotland wrt Celtic/Rangers etc than anything else.)

I was always top of my class in that school to the extent where I would finish my work and watch the teacher teach the older kids in my class (it was a composite class P1/2 P2/3 etc.). I didn't drop a mark on the maths tests we did every year until my mum asked for me to be allowed to do the one for the year above at which point I dropped 2 out of 100 (No one ever told me how to use a protractor so I just guessed.) To be honest the leasons their were boring. I left that school after a final blow out between my mum and the head mistress and went on to get straight As in Standard grade/Intermediate 2s, Highers, and Advanced Highers. A few weeks off between the ages of 5 and 11 didn't do me much harm.

Ps in your other comment here I notice you talked about parents taking kids out for educational holidays vs ones for the parents. I say I went to Disney land but that was only one year and we went to the Kennedy space centre, Epcot, and a lot of other places.

&gt;PNC: Three teams, all fourth on their RWC pool: two direct qualifiers, one two-shot repechage.

I don't understand what you mean here.

*Edit: After reading it a bit more clearly I think I get what you mean. The PNC team that doesn't qualify will get a shot at a European team to qualify directly and then the repêchage if they lose that. That is not great but I think they will likely win the game against the European team and not need the final safety net anyway.

Yes the fact there will be lots of European teams fighting over one qualifying spot and one repêchage spot is not great but if we give Europe more spaces we could end up with 10 or more European teams able to qualify which would make it a bit less of a ""world"" cup. I agree Canada and the US and Uruguay didn't do much to justify their spots but I think we should have at least one of them there and it seems unlikely there will be more than two. *Edit: I miss read it. There will definitely be two with the third in the repêchage.

I got the front three right (I couldn't really get that wrong) and the halfbacks and centres (I said it would come down to injuries and I assume that is why Dunbar has been left out). The back three I thought Tonks would go and Visser or Lamont would miss out but can't argue too much with this. 

Where I start to go wrong is I said Harley would take the 4th Second row spot but to be fair Swinson was not on the squad list on the SRU website. In the backrow I wimped out a bit and said Strokosch would miss out but didn't want to call the rest. I don't see why Stronker is in the squad. He *was* great for Scotland and is a real hardman but he has been injured for most of the season and the rest of it has been spent playing for a 2nd division French club who didn't even get promoted. Surely he is past it? I would have taken Barclay instead as I feel we are a 7 short and the 8s we have can cover 6 anyway. I'm still not sure if that would be the right combo but it would be better.

1160,"Still left in the squad:

– FORWARDS (22) –

Prop (5):

Alasdair Dickinson (Edinburgh Rugby) – 45 caps; 4 RWC appearances (2007 and 2011)

Ryan Grant (Glasgow Warriors) – 23 caps

Willem Nel (Edinburgh Rugby) – 1 cap

Gordon Reid (Glasgow Warriors) – 10 caps

Jon Welsh (Newcastle Falcons) – 5 caps

I assume all of these will make it as most squads take 5 props.

Hooker (3):

Fraser Brown (Glasgow Warriors) – 9 caps

Ross Ford (Edinburgh Rugby) – 87 caps; 8 RWC appearances (2007 and 2011)

Stuart McInally (Edinburgh Rugby) – 1 cap

Again I assume all will make it.


Second-row (5):

Grant Gilchrist (Edinburgh Rugby) – 9 caps

Jonny Gray (Glasgow Warriors) – 13 caps

Richie Gray (Castres) – 45 caps

Jim Hamilton (Saracens) – 63 caps; 6 RWC appearances (2007 and 2011)

Robert Harley (Glasgow Warriors) – 16 caps

Probably one to be cut I guess Jonny is the safest with Hamilton most likely to go unless Gilchrist is deemed unfit. Harley is really a backrow so assume he will go to cover both positions. 

Back-row (9):

Adam Ashe (Glasgow Warriors) – 6 caps

John Barclay (Scarlets) – 44 caps; 4 RWC appearances (2007 and 2011)

Hugh Blake (Glasgow Warriors) – 1 cap

Blair Cowan (London Irish) – 12 caps

David Denton (Edinburgh Rugby) – 26 caps

John Hardie (Unattached) – 1 cap

Josh Strauss (Glasgow Warriors) – Uncapped

Alasdair Strokosch (Perpignan) – 45 caps; 3 RWC appearances (2011)

Ryan Wilson (Glasgow Warriors) – 9 caps


This is the hardest one to call. I can see just about all of them making it but equally any of them could be cut. I think Stonkosch is past it but he was captain at the weekend so what do I know? 

– BACKS (18) –

Scrum-half (4):

~~Chris Cusiter (Sale Sharks) – 70 caps; 6 RWC appearances (2007 and 2011)~~

Sam Hidalgo-Clyne (Edinburgh Rugby) – 7 caps

Greig Laidlaw (Gloucester) – 39 caps

Henry Pyrgos (Glasgow Warriors) – 15 caps

Cusiter has already ruled himself out but is still in the squad on the SRU website I guess that makes the other three safe.

Stand-off (3):

Ruaridh Jackson (Wasps) – 26 caps; 3 RWC appearances (2011)

Finn Russell (Glasgow Warriors) – 9 caps

Duncan Weir (Glasgow Warriors) – 19 caps

Russell will obviously be in the squad Jackson is probably most likely to go here.

Centre (5):

Mark Bennett (Glasgow Warriors) – 7 caps

Alex Dunbar (Glasgow Warriors) – 14 caps

Peter Horne (Glasgow Warriors) – 9 caps

Matt Scott (Edinburgh Rugby) – 27 caps

Richie Vernon (Glasgow Warriors) – 22 caps; 3 RWC appearances (2011)

I guess the decision here will come down to injuries but whoever misses out here will be unlucky.

Back-three (6):

Stuart Hogg (Glasgow Warriors) – 32 caps

Sean Lamont (Glasgow Warriors) – 95 caps; 8 RWC appearances (2007 and 2011)

Sean Maitland (London Irish) – 15 caps

Tommy Seymour (Glasgow Warriors) – 17 caps

Greig Tonks (Edinburgh Rugby) – 6 caps

Tim Visser (Harlequins) – 19 caps

1164,"&gt;The environmental impacts of the nuclear accidents of Chernobyl and Fukushima are compared. In almost every respect, the consequences of the Chernobyl accident clearly exceeded those of the Fukushima accident. In both accidents, most of the radioactivity released was due to volatile radionuclides (noble gases, iodine, cesium, tellurium). However, the amount of refractory elements (including actinides) emitted in the course of the Chernobyl accident was approximately four orders of magnitude higher than during the Fukushima accident. For Chernobyl, a total release of 5300 PBq (excluding noble gases) has been established as the most cited source term. For Fukushima, we estimated a total source term of 520 (340–800) PBq. In the course of the Fukushima accident, the majority of the radionuclides (more than 80%) was transported offshore and deposited in the Pacific Ocean. Monitoring campaigns after both accidents reveal that the environmental impact of the Chernobyl accident was much greater than of the Fukushima accident. Both the highly contaminated areas and the evacuated areas are smaller around Fukushima and the projected health effects in Japan are significantly lower than after the Chernobyl accident. This is mainly due to the fact that food safety campaigns and evacuations worked quickly and efficiently after the Fukushima accident. In contrast to Chernobyl, no fatalities due to acute radiation effects occurred in Fukushima.

1168,"What is your source on six dying? All I can find in your source is:

&gt;Over 20 workers were injured by 18 March.[1] Three workers were exposed to radiation and two were rushed to a hospital with up to 180 mSv, which is less than the maximum 250 mSv that the government allowed for workers at the plant.[12] Both workers, one in his twenties and one in his thirties, were from Kandenko and were regular workers at Fukushima II nuclear power plant.[10] Another worker was from a contract company of Kandenko.[54]

And this:

&gt;On 10 July 2013, Masao Yoshida, leader of the Fukushima 50, died of esophageal cancer. TEPCO stated this form of cancer was unlikely related to the event at Fukushima since it usually takes 5–10 years to develop.

And unless things have changed recently there have been *no* deaths linked to the disaster:

&gt;There were no casualties officially reported to be caused by radiation exposure. However, Masao Yoshida, the former Fukushima supervisor of damage control who was among the Fukushima 50 (employees who remained on site for clean-up after others were evacuated) died of esophageal cancer in July 2013. There is some dispute as to whether this was due to his radiation exposure during the 2011 event.[citation needed]

&gt;Predicted future cancer deaths due to accumulated radiation exposures in the population living near Fukushima are predicted to be extremely low to none.[37] However workers involved in mitigating the effects of the accident do face minimally higher risks for some cancers.[38]

&gt;WHO Report

&gt;In 2013, two years after the incident, the World Health Organization indicated that the residents of the area who were evacuated were exposed to so little radiation that radiation induced health impacts are likely to be below detectable levels.[39]

From [here] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster_casualties).

Edit: I did find this:

&gt;The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster has no confirmed casualties from radiation exposure, though six workers were killed during the containment efforts or work to stabilize the Earthquake and Tsunami damage to the site.[9]

&gt;The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), released a report on the Fukushima accident April 2, 2014. It stated that the scientists have found no evidence to support the idea that the nuclear meltdown in Japan in 2011 will lead to an increase in cancer rates or birth defects.[10]

&gt;None of the workers at the plant have died from acute radiation poisoning.[11]

[Here] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_and_radiation_accidents_by_death_toll) But as it says none of the deaths were caused by radiation.",2015-08-04 21:38:29+00:00,ctrl9uk,2.0,t1_ctrgkgm,6829.0,todayilearned

1316,"Haven't been able to watch us too much this season but here is my opinion for what it is worth.

Fairly unsurprising to see SHC at the top of the pile in fact anyone else probably would have been a shock. 

Ben Toolis has really kicked on this year and I don't understand why he isn't in the Scotland squad.

Nearly everything I have seen/ heard about Visser this season has been fairly indifferent so surprising to see him at number three on the list; hopefully his move to Quins will be good for him.

WP Nel being so high up can only be good for Scotland as, especially now with Murray retiring, depth at tight head is always welcome.

Grant is a work horse who I think everyone wants to see pull on the dark blue one day but I looks like it isn't going to happen. Still good to see him putting in a shift for Edinburgh though. Surprised he is above Watson.

I know next to nothing about propping but everyone seems to be saying Dickinson is in the form of his life so I guess this makes sense.

Ross Ford seems to have improved his throwing (still not great but not awful) and is still fairly solid.

When I saw Bresler at the start of the season he didn't seem to be up to much but I guess has improved a bit since then?

Fife is good if unspectacular on the wing, would like to see more of Hoyland and Farndale next year (although Farndale isn't listed in the squad on the website). Oh and maybe Robbins.

Coman seemed to improve the team when ever he played but spent a lot of time injured so I guess that is why he isn't higher (still get him confused with Du Preez).

As for those not on the list a lot of the bigger names (Gilchrist, Scott, Denton etc) have spent most of the year either injured or on international duty. McInally was playing well at the end of the season but, again, was injured for most of it. A lot of the others either didn't get much game time or, in the case of people like Strauss, got lots but were fairly mediocre and did little with it.

Fair assessment?",2015-06-24 17:27:47+00:00,csh9gvm,1.0,t3_3ayz0u,1502.0,rugbyunion

If that is Australia we have a very good recent record against. If it is England or Wales these are both teams we have only narrowly lost to recently so we should be able to beat them especially as we will up our game to get revenge.

In the Semifinals it will probably be one of France, Ireland or Argentina. The arguments for Argentina are the same as for Australia above and for France the same as England and Wales. As for Ireland we had nothing left to play for against them in this years Six Nations and were carrying some injuries. The Irish will be lulled into a false sense of security and we will win.

For the final it is either one of the teams all ready mentioned or South Africa who we will have sussed out in the group stages and again given a false sense of security to or New Zealand, the perennial chokers who we ran close in the Autumn.

Add to this the confidence gained by the members of the squad from Glasgow who now know what it feels like to win something and the hunger the other players in the squad will have to feel the same way after having first hand experience of what it is like to know someone who has won a trophy and you can clearly see why not only *can* Scotland win the World Cup but they clearly should be favourites to do so.",2015-06-23 12:44:36+00:00,csftpa5,2.0,t1_csfsv5r,2270.0,rugbyunion
