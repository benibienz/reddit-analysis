1,"All you need to focus on really is the score bubble.  The way it works is that it makes whatever points you earn during it's use increase.  But since time is 'frozen' during Yoda's skill, it applies to every single tsum cleared during his skill. 

Basically when I play Yoda, I try to get a score bubble as fast as possible, so his first use is done as fast as possible just to have a score bubble.  Resist the urge to pop the bubble, and play until fever mode and Yoda's next charge.  When fever mode starts, use Yoda asap, then when time is froze, pop the score bubble and clear tsums.  Having too many bubbles in the screen might actually lower your final score, so having one score bubble would be ideal.  If you happen to have two it does increase the score more, but i find it better just to focus on getting one.",2016-07-12 17:11:35+00:00,d59f2fc,3,t1_d59bpia,4187,TsumTsum

22,"I've been playing with her a lot recently trying to unlock the secrets.  Beforehand I was only making 2m with her at skill level 5, not knowing how people made such high scores with her.  Now, I make around 5m, and made 9m on my best games.  It seems using her successfully depends on several factors, as others have pointed out here, for example, clearing the snowmen in 3 small swipes instead of one big swipe.  The other factors that matter are:

1. Luck.  I've had games last 8 minutes due to how many time bubbles appeared.  Sometimes, you just get super lucky and get enough time bombs to profoundly increase game time, which, of course, increases score.

2. Tsums that appear.  It feels like, to me, unlike other tsums like Jasmine who can net me very high scores regardless of tsum point levels, Elsa's score value strongly depends on the point value of the tsums on the board.  I've noticed really large score deviations between games with only premium tsums and games that had happiness tsums.

3. Similar to above, the point level of tsums.  If the tsums you're playing with are still under level 20, then their points are very low compared to other people that have max level tsums, which would explain why they get such higher scores.

4. Practice, of course!  Once you get the hang of the three swipe method after playing 20 or 30 games, it comes more naturally and you see yourself being consistent with 5m+ games.",2016-04-05 17:22:10+00:00,d1qxajl,1,t3_4de4tc,58792,TsumTsum

BB Pooh is the best skill level 1 coin earner, but he's tough to get since he's only available for short periods of time.  Good earners are burst type Tsums, such as Ariel, Belle, Jasmine.  If, for some reason, you are focusing only on happiness tsums, max skill dale, chip, pluto are ok coin earners for beginners.  These are just a few examples, there's probably other tsums that are good at low levels, but this has been my experience.

Join the reddit group, or if you are able to send 35 hearts a week, join a tsum tsum line group.  honestly these are the best ways to earn easy coins if you're able to keep tending to your phone to send / receive hearts.  Most of my tsums are skill 4 &amp; 5, and this is still the best method to earn coins for me.",2016-02-05 20:04:04+00:00,czp740q,1,t3_44cg37,1688,TsumTsum

63,"So much discussion for this topic!  Do we need any more two cents?  Sure, why not!

Belle is really good at skill level 2 compared to other skill level 2 and level 3 tsums.  However, her shine fades after level 2, her special doesn't really go up as fantasticly as it does from skill 1-&gt;2.  I'm about to get her to lv 5, but she's still not better at 4 compared to some other level 4 tsums.  

For my play style (very consistent, repetitive and lazy) I really enjoy Jasmine.  I have her at skill level 5, though, so that's pretty far from level 2... I didn't really enjoy playing her a lot until she was skill level 4.  Basically when I play Jasmine, I get to the first fever asap, match til I get Jasmine ready, wait till fever ends, use Jasmine, get into fever, match til Jasmine is ready, wait till fever ends, etc.  Basically I just use her to instantly go back into fever once it ends, since her ability charges up so fast.  It makes for a very easy, consistent, and almost mindless coin grinding experience once you get use to it, which makes coin grinding easier for me.  

I'm still waiting for Beast level 5, I'm only one tsum away!  I really hope it drastically changes his gameplay, because at skill level 4 he is still a pretty lousy tsum compared to others for me... but if he's as good as others say at level 5... he is a strong contender for who to use them on.

Anyway, I think saving the skill tickets for now (or until they would all level up beast) is still your best bet, as Belle doesn't really improve much over time. ",2016-01-27 18:33:02+00:00,cze4a4d,1,t3_42rvpu,98481,TsumTsum

71,"First tip:  Getting off the ground at first is really tough until you get that great coin farmer (Ariel, Bell, Birthday Anna, Jasmine for example).  I found that joining the monthly line thread (which should be coming up soon) and spamming hearts to each other helps lots when first starting out.  Not necessarily a game play tip, but this really helps out beginners in both giving lots of hearts and also getting lots of easy coins.

When I started out, I actually tried to max out some of the better happiness tsums before even trying for any premiums.  Maxing the skills of pluto or chip / dale is good, as they're relatively decent tsums that are better than many of the skill level 1 and even some level 2 premium tsums. Max Eeyore is also really fun to use for score.  However, upcoming lucky times might be better options for spending coins, so I'd hold off on spending unless you just can't help yourself.  Just don't buy premiums on non lucky times.",2015-12-29 17:49:32+00:00,cyf57w8,1,t3_3ymrc7,36992,TsumTsum

I have her at skill 3, she is by far my best coin earner, though she takes more skill to use.  Level 3 Jasmine is my second best, and much easier to use.

I've found my best tsum for making a high score was actually Eeyore, and still is, though I have quite a few skill level 3 premiums.  If you watch videos on how Eeyore is played, a max skill Eeyore can earn you 4m+ even at low levels.  Right now my best premium for scores is skill 3 lightning mcqueen.  I have skill 3 beast but he's still not earning me more than mcqueen or eeyore.",2015-12-11 16:44:27+00:00,cxvgqlg,1,t3_3wbmoh,48113,TsumTsum

The game itself is pretty dry, the incentive is to get more coins to get better tsums, but once you have all the tsums... the game goes back to a basic 'match 3' style game without enough other aspects to keep it exciting and fresh.  Also, the login bonuses / event bonuses are pretty weak compared to other games, so eventually people decide to A: Give up, or B: Hack.  Not everyone likes to go max coins though, some people just use it to give themselves a little incentive to keep playing, like posted here.
