Is anyone else just trudging through this or am I one of the only ones still rubberbanding like crazy?  Every 10 or so seconds this happens.  I can't play the game at all like this, and I already tried pinging the server and playing other MMOs and I am not experiencing any lag issues in anything.  This has been happening regardless of what time I play, since day one.  I log in daily to test to see if it's gone, but it's always there.  I played in CBT and this was never an issue.... I know that there's been a lot of lag but is it really this bad for everyone else??  I'm in US on Klaipeda, as well.

It's been driving me crazy lately!  My tablet is not old or lagging, the game runs very fluidly, tsums fall quickly and etc, it's just sometimes periodically the game itself will flake out, I'll touch bubbles, nothing happens, I'll touch to use the tsum's special 3 - 4 times and nothing happens... until about 2-3 seconds later suddenly the skill goes off or bubbles will pop, all while the timer and game are running normal speed.  It's really confusing and frustrating because 1 out of 4 or 5 games has this issue, and it definitely affects how well matches can be made too, sometimes it thinks I lifted my finger up when I certainly did not, and it will kill chains before they form even though I know I made the correct movement to clear it.  At first i thought I was just going too fast, but after a few weeks of having some high score games screwed up by sudden refusal to accept inputs fluidly, I know that my game is occasionally just... pooping out.  Just wondering if anyone else has noticed this kinda thing.  It only really bothers me when I'm wanting to play at my best / for high score and not just coin farming.
