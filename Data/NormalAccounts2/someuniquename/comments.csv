Well he accidently fucked up a order and the wrong ribs were sent out. He asked for memphis, he got dr pepper bbq. Well it is sent back and he throws the correct ribs through. It comes out and he is rushing so much that he drops it on the ground. Looks at it for 1 second. Looks up, see that our boss isnt out in the front running plates picks it up, dusts it off, throws it on the plate and sends it out. Disgusting.

40,"Late but being a chief fan is amazing and you will never turn your back on it. The chiefs are a highly respectable team on and off the field. They do a lot for the community. Fans make you feel like a giant family. 

Some things you do need to know; go to a game early on and grab some bbq. Enjoy the beer and conversations with strangers. 

Some players you should read up on; priest holmes, him and LdT goin at it 2 times a year was some of footballs best moments. Derrick Thomas, a qbs worst nightmare in the 90s. Dante hall, the x factor, the human joystick. Watching video of him shows he earned the nickname the human joystick. Will shields, an OL faster than your defense and ran in front of priest holmes destroying any defender in his way. Jamaal charles, on of our best rbs of all time. Man is a power house. After an acl tear he ran for 1500 in a season. He tore his acl last year so hopefully something like this happens again. But he is one incredible rb and watch him this year cuz it could be his last. These are just a few of my favorite but there is so many more amazing people to read up on. 

Oakland are the bad guys, broncos are the other bad guys, and chargers...well i like to think we kinda like them. Not friends but not foes. The enemy of my enemy is my friend kinda deal.

Well first time we hung out since he got out was also the first time we smoked together. i had a few grams of wax. He thought he could handle a dab and i tried to tell him he couldnt.

Jazz cartier-marauding in paradise(also easily the best mixtapr this year.) Has some bangers like dead or alive and new religion but also some  songs about relationships like rose quartz/like crazy and finishes strong with see you in hell. Definitely give i a chance.

Mich Jenkins- The Water[s] just a great mixtape with a water theme.

Hurt Everybody- 2k47 just now getting into these guys but damn do i love supa bwe and mulattobeats beats. 

Metal-

The plot in you-first born. Heavy, angry, in your face. Great workout album.

Any stray from the path album- because it has a rage against the machines feel but more angry.

Letlive-thr blackest beautiful. Great album with a little of everything. From a hip hop influence to jazz all centered around being hard and loud.

Beartooth-disgusting. Just great.

I dont know why this has always been my favorite song. But the first time i heard it was after hanging out with Mac Duna. Duna was hanging out with a good friend of mine who owned a dispensary and duna just happened to be there. I wasnt as big of a hip hop fan yet but i knew of mac dre. So we are all kickin it smokin n chattin for a few hours. Later after duna left i was just like ""well shit, give me a song to listen to by mac dre.""
