I'd never heard of or visited that site before. What the fuck possesses people to be this stupid and gullible? As for what they are saying, I found this quote in a wonderful article the day after the election:

&gt;God gave us a gift yesterday. Now, let’s do what should have been done from the start. Let’s not just make America great again, let’s turn back to the Creator of All, our Almighty Savior, and make America godly again! He is our only true hope.

And they can truly rationalize anything as being ""holy"" as evidenced by this quote from another article there:

&gt; But, thank God, a man like Donald Trump decided to run for POTUS and he began to speak the words that awakened millions of people in America to our terrible dilemma, that we were headed for the dustbin of history unless we could undo the change of, not just the last eight years, but the last forty years, possibly more. 

&gt;Against all the odds, and the resistance of his own political party, Mr. Trump became the president-elect of the United States last week, much to the chagrin of Hillary Clinton and her party, as well as a large share of the GOP elites. I know that many Christians do not believe Donald Trump is qualified to be POTUS due to his “moral failures,” mostly his failed marriages and a few failed businesses. 

&gt;However, throughout history, God has chosen, and used, many men who were much bigger failures than Mr. Trump.  **Ever hear of King David, an adulterer and murderer, whom God called “a man after MY Own heart”**?

Nothing could be said to a person that believes this firmly that anyone can be used by god and you should just blindly follow them.",2016-11-20 17:55:38+00:00,da8d8aj,5.0,t1_da8bv81,2016.0,news

2,"From the original story (translated by Google from German):

&gt;However, the Clinton Foundation is the charitable founding of the family of then US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who in turn was an important contact person of the Swiss Confederation in the tax dispute. It was an open secret that she was working with the US Department of Justice and the tax authority IRS not to proceed with even more crude artillery against Switzerland.

&gt;In the summer of 2011, **Micheline Calmy-Rey emphasized that she had a direct link to Clinton: ""Believe me, that helps if, for example, Swiss banks get under pressure in the USA.""**

Yep, move along folks. Nothing to see here. /s

3,"The map is too limited in its data to make that conclusion with any degree of certainty.

Yes, Hillary won all of those southern states where there are larger minority demographics, but it doesn't show by how much or even when their primaries were held. 

The former would show that his message did play to those demographics and the latter would provide a potential impact of how the early voting and non-exposure of the rigging of the primaries coincided.

It also discounts the effect that the media had on Sander's campaign with the lack of exposure in the first few months to their intentional bias in Hillary's favor of reporting superdelegate commitments as set in stone votes for Hillary the entire way which, in many ways, was the biggest factor in Hillary's winning the nomination than any disagreements with Sander's platform/proposals.

The WikiLeaks Podesta email dump has clear evidence of people at the DoJ sending warnings to the Clinton campaign about upcoming hearings and other information to give them time to prepare.

&gt;The text continues, “What has happened has happened, at Sigonella they are standing still, they have to remain firm.”But according to the message, Clinton insisted, **“the more hours go by the better it is,” claiming, “it will seem that he is not able to take a decision about an international scenario.” **

24,"&gt;One section of the report deals with September 2012 — the same month as the attack that killed U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens, and three others. In an alleged message from Clinton to top aide Huma Abedin, the secretary made it clear she wasn’t going to rush to take action.

&gt;“Avoid that they appeal to the AUMF, lets give a political weight to the wait, take time,” the message reads. (The acronym AUMF most likely refers to an “authorization for the use of military force.”)

&gt;The text continues, “What has happened has happened, at Sigonella they are standing still, they have to remain firm.”

&gt;Sigonella almost certainly refers to Naval Air Station Sigonella, located in the Italian island region of Sicily. According to reports, a US Air Force source once claimed that attack jets were being armed and fueled at Aviano Air Force Base in northern Italy on Sept. 11, 2012, or the night of the Benghazi attacks. The source has said the jets could have refueled at Sigonella, which is located some 400 miles from Benghazi, and helped stave off the slaughter.

&gt;But according to the message, Clinton insisted, **“the more hours go by the better it is,”** claiming, **“it will seem that he is not able to take a decision about an international scenario.”** Was she trying to make President Barack Obama look bad?

Salaries are good – scaled to meet the education and experience of the ambassador – and accompanied with free housing and an expense account.

She lied to them as well about her emails while under oath.

&gt;Back in October 2015, Benghazi Committee member Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) questioned Hillary Clinton about the handling of her emails, noting that she had altered her response over time about no classified material being sent or received (on her private server) to no material “marked classified” was sent or received.

&gt;Clinton said, “There was nothing marked classified on my emails, either sent or received. And I want to respond ….”

&gt;Jordan interjected, “You use the right term there – use ‘marked.’ That’s the one – that’s what you – you used the revised statement there.”

&gt;Clinton continued, “Well, but that’s, well, congressman, there was a lot of confusion because many, many Americans have no idea how the classification process works. And therefore I wanted to make it clear that there is a system within our government, certainly within the State Department, where material that is thought to be classified is marked such, so that people have the opportunity to know how they are supposed to be handling those materials. And that’s why it became clearer, I believe, to say that nothing was marked classified at the time I sent or received it.”

Clearly, before any of her emails had been thoroughly examined or, in some cases, even turned over, she felt strongly enough to let the entire Congress know that she knew exactly how the classification system worked.

That should be enough to prove that she knew what the in-line markings meant and that she willingly sent classified emails to someone using unsecure channels and perjured herself to Congress.",2016-07-12 19:36:35+00:00,d59m05o,6.0,t1_d59lq4y,351.0,uncensorednews

&gt;Glad you asked. If you are testifying in front of Congress sometime soon, and are wondering how far you can bend the truth, there are a two key statutes governing perjury you need to be aware of: U.S. Code sections 1621 and 1001 of Title 18.

Section 1001 covers false statements more generally, without requiring an oath. The section stipulates that ""whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the government of the United States, knowingly and willfully"" falsifies or conceals information, including before a congressional committee's inquiry, may also be fined or imprisoned up to five years.

* A bill to support loans to areas hit by natural disasters
* A bill to direct FEMA to offer block grants for homeland security purposes
* A bill to allow highway funds to be used to rebuild parts of Manhattan after the WTC attacks

&gt;Studies from both the Tax Foundation and another group, the Tax Policy Center, estimate that Trump's plan could cut tax revenues by more than $10 trillion dollars over the next 10 years, resulting in a large burgeoning of the national debt.

Their analysis of Hillary's plan
&gt;The former secretary of state ""wants to control when people realize capital gains by taxing people at different rates when they actually realize those gains,"" Hodge explained. ""If you're at a high income, your tax rate could be as high as 47 percent on your capital gains, and then it lowers to 27 percent over the next seven years.""

&gt;The foundation estimated that capital investment would fall by nearly 3 percent over a decade. ""It could have a very chilling effect on the market and on investors overall,"" Hodge added. 

Lastly, Sander's analysis:
&gt;Bernie Sanders is promising the opposite: Higher taxes for all. The Democratic candidate/senator from Vermont wants to **raise all taxes by 2.2 percent** and create four higher tax brackets for high earners. Sanders' top bracket would tax income over $10 million at a 52 percent rate.

&gt;The Tax Foundation's Hodge found that tax increase could raise $14 trillion but ""would come at a dramatic cost to the economy overall.""

While costs will surely rise some, they are going to regardless of whether or not the consumers' income raises with them.

There weren't concerns that the consumers couldn't afford it when gas was nearing $5/gallon. There weren't concerns that the consumers couldn't afford it when produce costs rose to offset the increase in production costs associated with higher fuel costs. These cost/production increase costs were always passed onto the consumer. The only thing that hasn't been has been the profits associated with these costs.

As for the republicans not going along with the changes, I'm almost certain that you would see a fair amount of blowback in the midterms if they stonewalled everything a President Sanders proposed. They're grasp on control of congress is tenuous at best.

You have to realize that, even though 911 was proposed as the standard in 1968, it wasn't nationally available immediately.

&gt;Just over ten years after Congress established 9-1-1 as the country’s universal emergency phone number, approximately 26% of United States citizens could dial 9-1-1 and be connected with their local emergency services. It might surprise you to learn that even just 25 years ago, **in 1989, that number had risen only to 50%.** However, just a decade after that, it rose to 93% of the country. Today, approximately 99% of people in the United States have access to the 9-1-1 emergency phone number system.

Now consider that Lakeland, FL wasn't much more of a cow town (~70k in the ""metro"" area) who's claim to fame during the 80's was that it hosted the FL state fair and was within a 20 minute drive to Disney World.

Also, being 9 years old and terrified, it's very easy to believe that they might not know/realize that they should call 911 or, if they did, if they'd even have a clue where to tell them to come to.

No, but she did break laws by using it to circumvent laws for handling documents that have been classified.

&gt;She didn't break any laws.

Maybe you should tell that to the United States.

&gt;18 U.S. Code § 1924 - Unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or material

&gt;(a) Whoever, being an officer, employee, contractor, or consultant of the United States, and, by virtue of his office, employment, position, or contract, becomes possessed of documents or materials containing classified information of the United States, knowingly removes such documents or materials without authority and with the intent to retain such documents or materials at an unauthorized location shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.

&gt;(b) For purposes of this section, the provision of documents and materials to the Congress shall not constitute an offense under subsection (a).

&gt;(c) In this section, the term “classified information of the United States” means information originated, owned, or possessed by the United States Government concerning the national defense or foreign relations of the United States that has been determined pursuant to law or Executive order to require protection against unauthorized disclosure in the interests of national security.

And, lastly,

&gt;No evidence for this

Maybe you shouldn't be so quick to dismiss how easily it would be to hack a private email server of a person who doesn't have a full time InfoSec team working to keep hackers out:

&gt;The White House insisted on Tuesday that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 'complied with the guidelines' set out in federal law when she gave a cache of emails to the State Department from a private account she used during her time in the Obama administration.

&gt;Clinton never had an official 'state.gov' email address. Her aides reached her at 'hdr22@clintonemail.com' for the four years she was America's top diplomat.

&gt;The first hint of a secret Clinton email address came from the infamous Romanian hacker who used the nom-de-hack 'Guccifer.' He was later sentenced to four years in prison for his illegal exploits.

&gt;Marcel Lazar Lehel – Guccifer's real name – breached the email account of Sidney Blumenthal, a former Bill Clinton aide who later joined Mrs. Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign. Blumenthal had sent emails to her at the 'clintonemails.com' address, according to The Smoking Gun. 

&gt;Some of the messages Guccifer leaked online consisted of intelligence reports, sent in late 2012 to Clinton's back-channel address, and covered matters in Libya – including the aftermath of the September 11, 2012 terror attack in Benghazi.

Think about it for a second, without the government intervening, the free market used children in the US work in factories/industries/fields.

&gt;Although the official figure of 1.75 million significantly understates the true number, it indicates that at least 18 percent of these children were employed in 1900. In southern cotton mills, 25 percent of the employees were below the age of fifteen, with half of these children below age twelve. 

Without the government intervening, companies literally killed those that wanted better working conditions.

&gt;he Ludlow Massacre was an attack by the Colorado National Guard and Colorado Fuel &amp; Iron Company camp guards on a tent colony of 1,200 striking coal miners and their families at Ludlow, Colorado, on April 20, 1914. Some two dozen people, including miners' wives and children, were killed. The chief owner of the mine, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., was widely criticized for the incident.

And there are almost always budget overruns and extensions needed because of the desire to overpromise and underdeliver. 

While NASA could just get rid of the contractor at the end of that time, they rarely do because there are only so many companies that can do this type of work and, when another company does get the next phase, they basically buy the employees that were previously working for the last company as part of it so you end up with the same people trying to accomplish the same goal.",2015-08-06 23:33:24+00:00,ctu78x5,1.0,t3_3fz6h5,59580.0,space

I worked for a subcontracter and my desk was in the mission control building and, at the time of the cuts, received a mass email asking all employees what parts of the country would they be willing to relocate to if the cuts directly impacted their employment at JSC.

Thankfully, my group was dedicated to work/tasks directly related to the ISS instead of the shuttle, but there was still fear and rumors of cuts of up to 1/3 of the workforce there.

902,"Your ""Uber Christian Friend"" mentions how the athiests tried to rewrite the history of FDR's speech and, at the same time, tries to rewrite the efforts of Thomas Jefferson to separate religion from government.

Jefferson wrote, what became, the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom and was the basis for the first amendment which explicitly states that **Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion**

&gt;Jefferson's original bill ""for establishing religious freedom,"" drafted in 1777 and introduced in 1779, was tabled in the face of opposition among powerful members of the established Church of England. Then, in 1784, a resolution calling for a tax to support all Christian sects excited such opposition that James Madison saw an opportunity to reintroduce Jefferson's bill. It passed both houses of the General Assembly with minimal changes to its text. One of the most eloquent statements of religious freedom ever written, the statute influenced both the drafting of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the United States Supreme Court's understanding of religious freedom.

And let's not forget that Jefferson also rewrote the New Testament to exclude any mention of miracles or other illogical accounts.

&gt;Much of the material Jefferson elected to not include related miraculous events, such as the feeding of the multitudes with only two fish and five loaves of barley bread; he eschewed anything that he perceived as “contrary to reason.” His idiosyncratic gospel concludes with Christ’s entombment but omits his resurrection. He kept Jesus’ own teachings, such as the Beatitude, “Blessed are the peace-makers: for they shall be called the children of God.” The Jefferson Bible, as it’s known, is “scripture by subtraction,” writes Stephen Prothero, a professor of religion at Boston University.

If we were to resubmit for the error checking, they would switch it out to a new label and remove the ""First Strike"" label at that point also. :(",2015-07-10 03:46:59+00:00,csy84xt,2.0,t1_csy822r,159.0,coins
