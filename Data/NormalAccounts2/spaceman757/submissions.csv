In articles and interviews, Brock outed himself as a liar. He confessed to lying in the Anita Hill book, even though the lies he admitted to were peripheral to his exoneration of Justice Clarence Thomas but devastating in what they said about Brock himself; he admitted he'd been a hatchet man and borderline extortionist. In a piece for Esquire - in which he was depicted bound to a tree, nipple exposed - Brock apologized to Bill Clinton and expressed regret over his ""Troopergate"" stories for the American Spectator. He said they were all true, mind you, but that he shouldn't have written them. 

&gt;But the problem was already obvious. As Jill Abramson told the Washington Post's Howard Kurtz, ""the problem with Brock's credibility"" is that ""once you admit you've knowingly written false things, how do you know when to believe what he writes?"" Yet by the end of the Clinton years and the beginning of the Bush administration, Brock had become a darling of the pro-Clinton media establishment as a supposed truth-teller. 

Bernie is being smeared and basically trying to be coerced to not say anything about Hillary, no matter how true it is, by this guy because it might damage Hillary's chances.

It's increasingly infuriating to me how these senators and congressmen who paid almost nothing for school, now think that it's okay for young adults today to leave school tens-hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt.

If I'm Bernie's camp, I hit Rep. Clayburn right in the gut with a little thing called facts:

&gt;Hamline University professor David Davies provides an illustration of how much harder it is to get by today: Davies pointed out that in 1968, a University of Minnesota student working 6.2 hours per week during the school year, at the minimum wage, would earn enough to pay the annual tuition and fees of $385. Davies wrote, “That was back when education was considered a public good and not a private investment… back when education was for the 99%.”

Now consider that Rep. Clayburn went to South Carolina State College in the 1960s, a HBCU, that was generally 30% cheaper than that.

Care Bears - Our wholesome Christian schools will not allow the introduction of witchcraft to indoctrinate the children!
