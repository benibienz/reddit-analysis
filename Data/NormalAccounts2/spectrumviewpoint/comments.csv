20,No not inferior at all. Innovative for sure and without it they would have never gotten to the US version. TBH the UK version probably doesn't get enough respect for what it was when it was released. ,2016-03-30 15:15:50+00:00,d1j4r0q,7,t1_d1j4kxx,225,AskReddit
21,"How much of the American Version did you watch?

I think that's part of the reason why The Office did so well because people could really relate to the characters. There's always that oddball annoying guy at work who just happens to do his job amazingly well but at the end of the day you are all one tight-knit group. 

The UK version has it's moments but in my opinion you cannot really compare them because one lasted 9 seasons, the other lasted 12 episodes and 2 specials. Both were great and funny. But still not really comparable. ",2016-03-30 15:08:46+00:00,d1j4fo1,5,t1_d1j2wkv,2127,AskReddit
