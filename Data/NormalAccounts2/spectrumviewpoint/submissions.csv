I took a very extended break from Destiny, and I mean extended I went on a few times here and there to do some crucible matches and few IB matches and I really mean a few.


I saw the stuff about the update and thought I get back into it. I made this post because I wanted a few opinions...

did they fix the loot system?
best legendary weapon?
best exotic armor?
current best crucible primary weapon? pve?


I know some of these are subjective but there's a lot that I do have as far as arsenals go but still lacking a few key exotics that I want so I want to know where to really put my time since DPT has become so scare around my house! 

Thanks in advances for all the input! all five who see the post anyway!
