0,"Interesting, I mean I think a playthrough on Silent Hill 4 would be very interesting, and there is basically no other videos playing through it on youtube that are decent so it's a great way to capture some views.

If the Best Friends did that sort of thing I would even donate to a Patreon/Kick-Starter or whatever just to see them give Silent Hill Origins a playthrough, thats how much I dig their work on the series. ",2016-08-16 03:38:44+00:00,d6j9cn9,2,t1_d6hyp64,81312,TwoBestFriendsPlay

3,"Does anyone also know of any ""reviews"" on horror films that are similar to that of a video game walk-through with in depth-plot summaries? ",2016-04-14 03:01:39+00:00,d223yvl,1,t3_4e7zmd,274695,horror
4,"Checked out CinemaSnob and watched the Halloween and Friday the 13th reviews, he's alright, the movies he reviews just aren't my ""cup of tea."" I'm sorry I am so hard to please, I'm just very particular, but I will totally check out the other channels thanks!

Chris Stuckman is alright but he's not really my thing either. lol.",2016-04-11 22:58:29+00:00,d1z349s,2,t1_d1z19se,2818,horror
5,"Yeah he is a little more critical with his videos, I do enjoy the humor in his videos though. Subtle but noted! 
I like both styles of reviews between YMS and GoodBadFlicks, videos that recap the movie's plot and don't just feature someone talking about the film without showing it. Videos similar to Blood Bath and Beyond just don't feature the movies enough for me in their reviews. ",2016-04-11 00:31:03+00:00,d1xw3gm,4,t1_d1xvfcb,1180,horror
