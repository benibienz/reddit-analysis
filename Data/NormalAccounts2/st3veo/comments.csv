0,"Posted this in another thread before (ideas for a new type of cinema), someone replied saying it was a good idea, so i'll post it here again too:-

""NY Time square - Big screen cinema in the middle of time square, big advertising board that actually streams the movie, similar to this:-

Devs could even make money from adverts surrounding the big screen (doubt it will be Coca Cola etc) but companies who want to sponsor them.""

4,"I'd recommend SonarVR, that and Kurios are the best VR experiences I've had.

Not sure if you can still get it though.

I had to submit my e-mail to get a download link a few months ago.

7,"VR Take Away

Envisioning an app which puts you virtually inside a restaurant (say Pizzahut), you can look up at the menu and a member of staff serves you in virtual reality so your still getting a personal service that you don't get ordering online or over the phone.

If your waiting too long or member of staff is being an arse, say 'fine, I'll go to Dominos' few taps on your VR device *bam* your there in Dominos.",2015-10-30 00:23:34+00:00,cwhtj4s,1,t3_3qq9no,24614,GearVR

Best game is probably Smash Hit.

Kurios is the first thing i show people who haven't seen VR before. ",2015-10-26 16:14:33+00:00,cwdha7y,1,t3_3q90bb,34376,GearVR
9,"Yeah i enjoyed, I wouldn't buy a pay per view with it yet though, it's just not ready - As someone else pointed out it's not 3D and it makes me feel short sighted.

Exciting in how we are going to watch sport in the future though with VR, that's what i got from it - I've only just watched the Manchester United vs Barcelona video, that was even poorer quality, but gives an idea about the future.

That's what it's all about at the minute though unfortunately, trying/testing and improving in about 5 years is where we are probably going to have good 360 3D VR experiences to make it feel like your right there and that's when i'll start paying money out to watch these events.
