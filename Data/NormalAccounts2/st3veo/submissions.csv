In my opinion It does not, while VR is great, I don't come off VR feeling I've actually visited and experienced the place that I've just seen in virtual reality.

Whilst VR feels real at times, places that you've actually seen in real life are stored in your memory as something you've actually experienced and witnessed, things I've witnessed in VR does not have that same feeling.

Will we ever get to that?  If so how many years.  For me resolution as to improve first and foremost, I've had lasik but using VR i feel short-sighted again.  Seeing things close up is fantastic, but trying to watch things from a distance is poor, that's why it's not ready for ppv or anything like that just yet in my opinion.",GearVR,Do you feel like you've actually been to a place you've experienced in VR?,https://www.reddit.com/r/GearVR/comments/4h4a6n/do_you_feel_like_youve_actually_been_to_a_place/

Personally i think The Wizard of Oz would make a great VR experience, one minute in Kansas, swirling through a tornado (that part would be great VR) and then ending up in the mystical land of Oz.

Evil Dead would be great too, wizzing through the woods (envision that part like a rollercoaster experence in VR) and ending up in the creepy cabin, Deadites banging on the door and in the cellar, hearing voices going 'join us' - Be shit scary but would be great. 

Think any horror film would be great though, loved Catatonic, just waiting for a really good zombie apocalyptic experience for VR now.

What would be yours that hasn't already been made?

But how much improvement do you think the consumer version will be from the S6 Samsung Gear VR resolution wise? Enough to make people who own S6 Samsung Gear VR buy the consumer version straight away or will it just be a small jump, ie:- what the S6 Gear VR is now to Oculus DK2 which probably means all current Gear VR owners should wait another year or so for the 2nd generation.

My interest in VR, is not so much games, but films/sports/shows/locations and environments VR can put me in - So think mobile devices will always be more for me than Oculus Rift (when it comes out) which i believe is designed more for gaming.

Anyways.

1) Kurios - Amazing experience, can watch it several times and see something that you missed previous.  It's great how it is now, but imagine what shows like that could be in the future in HD quality within the next year or 2 - This is usually the first app show people so they can see what VR is like.

2) Oculus Cinema - Put Avatar 3D on BluRay on it the other day, was just sat in a real life cinema, also enjoyed the Dream Works app, there's something in there of a big cinema screen on a river, could easy watch a movie in that environment.

3) Insurgent - Great VR experience.

4) Avengers - Bit poor quality, but gives you an idea how films could be in the future.

5) Jurassic - Same as avengers, looking forward to watching a few documentaries like this in the near future in better quality.",GearVR,Your Top 5 Gear VR Apps?,http://www.reddit.com/r/GearVR/comments/3bvbf8/your_top_5_gear_vr_apps/

I didn't really think much of it, so uninstalled the ip app, but my Oculus store is still in $.

Here's whats even more mind boggling, since then, I've reset my Galaxy S6 to factory settings (wiped the phone clean).  Re-installed everything, including the Oculus app and it's still in $ and i can download the Milk app :/

I've just bought a Samsung S6 with Gear VR - Cinema is fantastic, but a little disappointed with some other of the apps I've tried in the 1 hour or so I've messed around with it so far.

The 360 tours, which reading reviews before i tried it for myself got great reviews, i was a little disappointed with, i found the resolution to be terrible, could barely make anything out.

The Jurassic video, i enjoyed - But again the resolution when the dinosaur was laid down, felt like VHS kind of quality of the 1980's, a lot better when it came close up.

I tried Goggle cardboard before this and I've got to be honest, my early views of Samsung VR it's not much different to cardboard.

I'm not sure if this is just an issue at my side or what (settings etc) most people seem blown away by Samsung Gear, I know VR is not consumer ready yet, but thought resolution would be a little better than what it is, do other people find resolution to be THAT bad? Is there anything i can do at my side to improve resolution?
