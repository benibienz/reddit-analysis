This is a much better wheel than the logitech and in a sale at the moment ($300 currently) so it's only $50 over your budget.

You will have to do alot of upgrading if you ever plan to get a shifter for it though (T3PA pedals, TH8A shifter for a combined extra ~$200).

You can get it with a leather wheel trim and T3PA pedals as standard for $450: https://www.amazon.com/Thrustmaster-Racing-Wheel-Leather-Premium-Official/dp/B0151K6FPC/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1479573211&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=thrustmaster+tx

If you can't afford that, the G920 with Driving Force shifter is a decent fallback.

It surely wouldn't be outside the realms of possibility that Negan has them all watched (he did afterall just corner them all by having ALL roads blocked/watched that they could have taken - so he must have at least suspected they had some reason for being out on the road trying to get to hilltop, c'mon).

So given Negan has known their every move so far, why did they at this point, so soon after two of them were just clubbed to death in front of their eyes, decide to try and risk hiding Maggie? When they surely at least suspect they are being watched.

1.  Negan takes the hatchet from Simon, putting it on his belt before he takes Rick on the RV trip.

2. Negan plants the axe in the table of the RV - effectively giving control of it to Rick, giving him the opportunity to attempt to attack him.

3. After stopping Rick's wrong reaction (attempting to attack him in the RV) - Negan takes the axe off Rick for the bad behaviour. He has now trained Rick not to do something with the axe that Negan doesn't want.

4. Negan then throws the axe on the roof of the RV. Playing a game of 'fetch' with Rick.

5. Negan puts his hand out for Rick to give him the axe. Good boy Rick hands it to him after retrieving it for Negan. Negan has now trained him that the axe belongs to Negan, and Negan only allows Rick to have it.

6. Negan cleans off the axe and gives it back to Rick, saying he will need it in the future (on second viewing, Negan has clearly already decided he's going to force Rick to try and cut his son's arm off).

7. After the whole thing with Carl, Negan takes the axe off Rick. Negan has now trained Rick to do something with the axe that Rick doesn't want to do, just because Negan tells him to do it.

8. Negan throws the axe over his shoulder as he leaves for Rick to pickup, knowing that he now owns Rick and he can be trusted to do whatever Negan wants him to do with the axe without being watched.

116,"&gt; That's just downright wrong: see here as an example

Another guy already said it, but I was referring to the statement made on T10's website about a week before the ban wave started appearing:

""
Player PC Bans A note for our Forza Horizon 3 players on Windows 10: In the interest of protecting our in-game economies and maintaining fair play, we have begun enforcing cheating bans in Forza Horizon 3. Our monitoring systems are built to detect cheating and are actively targeting programs such as the “Forza Horizon 3 trainer.” Players who are caught using these programs while playing Forza Horizon 3 **will be subject to a non-reversible permanent ban from online play in the game**. We do this to help advance our goal of providing the best possible game experience for the vast majority of players who want to enjoy Forza Horizon 3 the way it was meant to be played.
""

So when people get banned until 2046 or whatever it was, with no reason given (and with this being the only statement from T10 so far about what you can get banned for), you can't blame them for thinking T10 have got it wrong (which we all now have proof that they had).

I'm probably more neutral on the issue than you think I am (we both probably read more into each others words on the Internet than we should), I was more somewhat worried about being 30 year banned for no reason (as it seemed quite evident that some other people were being if you read enough of the comments) so close to the point at which you could no longer refund.

The main problem was lack of communication from Turn 10 (their twitter account still hasn't even mentioned the issue, despite talking about other minor issues with the game, such as AH being down for a few hours). There is still nothing new on their forums about the issue either (this is literally the only short thing about bans: http://forums.forzamotorsport.net/turn10_postst76876_FH3-Anti-cheat-Measures-and-Bans--UPDATE-10-19-5-42-p-m---Appeal-process-details.aspx).

It is frustrating that they expect each individual to email in to get this fixed (I imagine there are plenty of people who haven't even tried online play yet who don't even know they were banned yet). It suggests that they can't tell themselves who they have banned by mistake, which is worrisome.

It will be interesting to see if they mention it in the next weeks review post (I suspect they won't as it tends to be mainly promotional stuff).

While I think the whole ""lets get IGN/Gamespot/whatever to write bad articles about FH3 for this"" bandwagon was a bit extreme - who knows, maybe this is what prompted T10 to get the finger out and fix it.

Wonder if this will put them off releasing FM7 for PC?

117,"I'm not sure what your point is? That we should assume everyone is guilty when they say they did nothing wrong? What would cheaters have to benefit by whining on reddit about being banned? That won't get them unbanned.

My problems with the issue are that those who were banned were not given any reason for the ban, which makes the fact that there seems to be a lot of false positives all the more infuriating. Add onto that the statement than bans are non-reversible - can you blame people who got banned for no reason to be totally pissed off?

Also, the way the moderators were treating people on the official forums was pretty shocking.

I do think people should go through the proper channels for getting unbanned though, and have some patience With Turn 10 as they are obviously going to be overloaded with requests after this screw-up.

Turn 10's only official statement on anti-cheat measures and bans: http://forums.forzamotorsport.net/turn10_postst76876_FH3-Anti-cheat-Measures-and-Bans.aspx

1.) If you've been unfairly banned in your opinion, your only course of action seems to be to email the dev's at: forzafb@microsoft.com (posts on their forum about this issue are being locked/deleted, note that the forum moderators are not necessarily turn 10 employees or up to date on the situation).

Don't expect anything more than an automated  reply if you do email them (which you should!), but they are presumably monitoring it and if enough people are contacting them, they might start believing that this is a real error on their part.

If you are contacting them, here is a list of information they say would be useful: http://forums.forzamotorsport.net/turn10_postst70118_If-reporting-issues-please-include-this-info-if-possible.aspx
Obviously your game tag would be helpful to them too.


2.) Some people also seem to be having some luck tweeting at Ian Webster (Community Manager for Turn 10): https://twitter.com/HeliosT10

He also has a reddit account where you can PM him your details: https://www.reddit.com/user/HeliosT10

3.) If you have given up hope, consider pursuing a refund, you can do this up to 30 days after you downloaded the game. Although there is a cooldown period on how often you can do a refund apparently, so if you are one of those who got a refund just to repurchase the game to get your DLC cars on release, you may be out of luck.

4.) **This part is just theory crafting based on responses so far in this thread**) A few people in this thread seem to have mentioned that they downloaded their forza rewards just before playing FH3 for the first game. If this is true for everyone here having a problem, then it could be a case of the anti cheat detection being screwed up and seeing people having credits already while still being at 0 playtime and deciding this must be a hack (which could possibly be an error brought in via the latest PC patch given all these bans are appearing suddenly now).

5.) Plenty of people have done the wheelspin / drift tap glitches before they were patched out. It is unclear yet whether this has anything to do with the bans, or if a large number of credits/skillpoints being generated all at once could be flagging accounts for bans. Given that there seems to be some relatively new players receiving bans without many credits it seems unlikely.

Given that so far the problem is only affecting PC players, drift tapping seems unlikely to be the reason for the bans. 

A forum moderator on T10 forums mentions that the wheelspin HE car credits glitch was not really a glitch, so this is also unlikely to be the reason for the bans: http://prnt.sc/cng5cg

From the post on T10's forums, the talk mainly about some trainer as being a reason for bans. I find it hard to believe so many people on this forum would be using such a thing, so it makes me paranoid about what is actually constituting a ban.

Turn 10 need to be alot more communicative about what's up, as it seems like they are unjustly banning some (which would be ridiculous) and/or they are making people who haven't done anything wrong wrongly worried.

Obviously poll questions like this will be more likely to gather people having problems than those who are not of course though.

Regardless of the reliability of the T300, I would still take the chance on it over the G29 if I was to buy again, but it totally depends on how much you are willing to spend (T3PA/Pro pedals are kind of a must have upgrade on the thrustmaster route).

I'm glad they've been patching in better wheel support, but it's worrying there is still no TH8A support for PC...

The interface though is horrible and inconsistent (holding left/right on the AH filters cycles though cars, but you can't hold left/right to edit the sizes, etc. of car paint job icons, you have to repeatedly tap it instead).

Also can't sell a car from the menu's in the garage, you have to specifically go to the AH page to sell, but on the AH page you can get into a car quicker than you can than in the garage...

The whole AH interface for bidding on (can only bid in single increments at a time), searching for (filters reset instead of being remembered) and selling cars (you can't relist an unsold car) is also clunky.

NFS may have had it way worse, I just said I'm surprised that modern games, including FH3, are still using it as a crutch, when we should really have fully dynamic, realistic AI drivers by now.

Lack of rubber banding once you get so far ahead of them on Goliath is more likely down to some other bugs in the engine (such as drivers outside of a certain range getting less AI processing done on them, therefore they are totally left in the dust / crash and get stuck once they fall too far behind (which is very easy on the huge goliath circuit).

I've had drivatars I've lapped suddenly go into tryhard mode after overtaking them and becoming competitive/overtaking me again briefly before you get to a part of the course the AI sucks at again and you leave them behind once more.

1.) Go to the windows store app, and browse to the fh3 ultimate edition page.

2.) Check the three parts of DLC on this page that should come with the ult. edition, they should say that you still have to buy them (this is presumably a bug).

3.) Go through the process of 'buying' them on the windows store. Don't worry, it won't charge you again but it will realise that you already own them.

4.) Check the ultimate edition page again, the DLC's should now display as 'Owned'.

Nobody suggests buying a 2nd hand TM wheel for example, while the best advice on most forums for those on a budget seems to be buying a 2nd hand G27.

Both systems have advantages and disadvantages. For me I'd say the G29 is more reliable and has much better stock pedals (they are an improvement on the G27 ones). It's downsides being a more notchy, rough feel in the FFB (although not as bad as the G27).

The T300 has a much better feel in it's FFB, due to it's belt system, but you have to take the gamble on reliablility/not getting a dud. Also the included pedals are a bit of a weak point.

Both wheels have noise issues. G29 from it's FFB (again said to not be as bad as with the G27) while the T300 can get noisy when it starts to overheatand the fan kicks in (a minor disadvantage to the belt based system).

If you're only playing PS4, and not PC, and ever plan to get a gearstick also, I would probably still go for the T300 though, as the TM gearstick is much better than the logitech alternative (not sure if you can mix logitech wheel with TM stick on the PS4 or not?

If Jon had stuck to his initial plan of holding back and drawing Bolton's men in so they could attack them on all sides, then Jon's army would have had far fewer casualties as the Vale Knights would still arrive during the battle (preventing Ramsey opting for a siege) and hopefully when Ramsey had committed his forces forwards allowing the Vale forces to hit them in the flank/rear.

So we have to give some props. to Ramsey for baiting Jon's attack and turning the battle into a massacre, that was only foiled by the Vale Knights unexpectedly showing up at the very last moment (when ideally for the Jon/Sansa army they could have arrived earlier in the battle).

You are right though that it could also have an element of LF twisting events to play out in his favour.

Regarding Carl, maybe Shane wouldn't have taken out Otis in desperation to save Carl from the gunshot wound as he wouldn't have been so attached to Carl/Lori. If Rick had ended up going on the run for meds for Carl instead, he wasn't as 'ready'/'crazy' as Shane for the apocalypse so he also wouldn't have taken out Otis to save Carl.

Bronn's best chance would be to somehow tire the Mountain out, but I think the Mountain is too aggressive a fighter for Bronn, forcing Bronn to parry some of the blows (rather than just evade them) so Bronn would be the first to tire.

Oberyn only managed this strategy with a much more defensive, longer weapon (which was also laced with a poison to slow the Mountain).

There is a part in Angel Exterminatus when Perturabo is recalling a conversation he had with the Emperor when he first joined His cause.

Perturabo recalls wondering if the Emperor knew that he was going to turn traitor on him, as the Emperor seemed to look at him with some sadness when Perturabo declared he would never let him down, or something to that effect.

The grief/sadness that the Emperor was trying to hide suggests to me that it wasn't a grand plan (or that if it was, it was something the Emps. was worried about happening/trying to avoid).

That's ok isn't it? If you have trouble coming up with a scenario in which the Emperor was in danger you're surely in the wrong subforum as nothing threatened his existence more than the Horus Heresy...

We have seen Horus struck down with one, which he later retrieved and gave to Fulgrim (can't remember if he used it, but he then gave it to Fabius who certainly did). They do seem to be making quite an appearance, so it's not outside the realms of imagination that they might turn up later in the fluff (maybe even Horus will have one against the Emps in their final confrontation if they choose to twist the fluff that way?)

My question is simple however, do you think speaking the words ""The Emperor of Mankind"" would empower such a blade against the big E?

I'm personally inclined to say it wouldn't work. As I don't think saying ""The Warmaster"" would have worked for empowering the blade against Horus (although it's been a while since I read the 2nd HH novel so can't remember exactly what was whispered to it).

He would probably have some rules that reduce the stats of anyone in close combat with him (in a similar way to horus, but it would happen just by being near him rather than after a hit/wound).

Probably some rule letting him always hit/wound on 3+.

Hard to say how OP you would make his psychic powers as we haven't even seen Magnus yet (who could easily end up being the most expensive primarch points wise purely down to psychic ability).

On the one hand, it could result in some cheesy (boring?) combos if it turns out the best strategy on a map is for everyone to pick a specific hero. Also aesthetically it doesn't look as 'cool' when everyone is on the same hero.

On the other hand, until there is a bigger hero pool, it could be a pain if you have 2 ppl arguing with each other over who gets to play a specific hero if they were limited to one per side/game.

Many fantasy players have stuck with the old edition due to the unpopularity of the new rules.

Also, most other games systems you can play with your warhammer fantasy models (such as mantic's kings or war) use a square base system and have some simple (in a good way) rules.

482,"I'd like to see inject removed, and replaced with something else, such as hatcheries built on/touching creep build twice as fast (or half cost of minerals).

This would make creep spread the zerg 'macro mechanic' (creep spread being something nobody really talks about when discussing macro mechanics as it's something terran/protoss have no equivalent of).

- Encourages zergs to spread creep to potential expansions, rather than just towards enemy base.
- Gives a good theme of zergs breeding/expanding out of control if left to their own devices.
- It's distinctly different from the terran/protoss macro mechanics.
- Critically, involves tactical decision making about where to spread your creep.

Of course, whatever changes would be made, people need to think of it as the first step on a design path, rather than the end game (and crying at the first sign of the removal of macro mechanics). Something better may (and should) be added in down the road to replace it.

483,"&gt; Or simply removed it and forced the zerg players to build more hatches

This, so much. Building macro hatches was one of the things that made zerg feel distinct from the other races in, dare I say it here, Brood War. The additional cost of building hatcheries was also offset by the fact that it made your production more robust by not relying on 1-3 town halls structures only.

People have come to think of 'macro' as meaning the same thing as 'macro mechanics' (because people talk of macro players as having 'good mechanics'). The macro mechanics in SC2 are just artificial additions on top of macro though.

Macro is about production, keeping units building, not getting supply blocked, knowing when to build more production facilities to keep up with your economy, rallying your units effectively and spending your mined resources efficiently.

You even have ways for spectators to monitor who's on top of their macro better in the UI in supply and resource counts for each player.

But now, in SC2 we are instead supposed to be more interested in who is pressing the inject button more regularly or dropping more mules.

I'd also like to add in that things like overlords all having detection on BW was another thing that made zergs feel more distinct that I feel has been lost. If you wanted to play cloaked units vs zerg you had to deal with the overlords somehow. An interesting problem that made people approach the matchup differently.

Differences between the races should be encouraged and promoted so that the each matchup has a different flavour.

Spells and deathrattles that summon totally random stuff onto the board though I think hurt the game and should be changed to only get common quality minions (no rares, epics or legendaries). Maybe allow rares too? This would take alot of the spiky RNG out of them (such as drawing doomsayer and clearing your own board as OP mentioned, also drawing a millhouse from a shredder...).

Piloted Shredder could still use a nerf on top of this though! He still gives too much value.

Until now, gateway tech units had to be weak as they had to be balanced around the possibility of a chronoboosted 2/4 gate rush and the ability for opponents to defend against it.

Not saying Blizzard will go this route, but I think it is a realistic possibility.

Thrustmaster T-16000M - a good, accurate, quality stick (due to the bearings), the fire buttons on it are a bit cheap feeling though from what I have heard. Best stick of the three you mentioned, but like the logitech - no throttle.
