What do you guys think of the idea of buying up as many as possible to fill your car collection before committing to your wheelspins?

Wheelspins (in my experience) never give you a car you already have (unless it is a HE car)

Can anyone confirm that this is the case? It seems to match up for me on my ~200ish wheelspins so far, but maybe this is too low a sample size?

So if you buy all/most of the cheap 'boring' cars, would this increase your chance of getting expensive cars from wheelspins? (e.g. d-type jag, HE cars, etc.)

The only flaw I see with this is why are people selling those cars? Presumably it must be because they already have duplicates of them, so maybe wheelspins can give you duplicate 'crappy' cars?

TLDR: buy other peoples cheap cars on AH and then use your wheelspins to suck up the rest.

Some of us listen to music outside the game, so when ingame music is forced on (you can't switch it off or change the station if it is) it just sounds like a garbled mess.

Most events I've tried seem to have music tracks picked for them so it seems quite a popular thing to do, which makes alot of them pretty unplayable (for me at least!)

While I'm not super worried about the loss (I have a few million credits and the cars only sell for 10-15K each) it is still a bit worrying that this could happen. Anyone had the same thing happening?

As the Emperor has no (known) name, do you think if someone whispered ""The Emperor of Mankind"" to such a blade, would it become deadly to Him? Or would the blades have no effect against him as the Emperors real name (if he has one) is not known to anyone.

Could this be a reason that the Emperor doesn't allow anyone to know his name? There is mentions in various parts of the fluff about how knowing the real name of a daemon gives you power over it. Perhaps the Emperor was wary of the Chaos gods having some power over him if they learned his name (assuming he is also a warp entity of some kind).

http://imgur.com/O37r6Wo

Does anyone ever vote for this? As there are usually much more interesting stats about players that get picked for the vote.

I think the problem is that damage is a (relatively) meaningless stat when you get into big numbers. How much is 18,472? Is it alot? Would it be more worthy of the award if it was 24,366 instead? For players coming from WoW or Diablo where damage is done in the thousands/millions/even billions per hit the numbers must seem even more insignificant.

For damage done it is easy enough to say that someone did, for example, 38% of the damage on their team. You can relate to that as it is a huge proportion of the damage on a 6 player team.

It is harder to do something like this for damage blocked as not everyone will be playing a character that can block damage, so the percentage would be meaningless.

Would it make more sense if it displayed as 'Kills Prevented'? Would it be possible to measure such a stat? Would it be fair to assume that all blocked damage would have hit a player if it was not blocked (not really I imagine).

Do other tanks have similar problems for having a meaningful stat on the vote screen? What is the general opinion on this? Could/should something be done to 'spice' up the meaning of what a tank like reinhardt brings to the team?

Should damage blocked even be something that is tracked for the vote screen? It just seems such a dull stat, and I have never seen a reinhardt win the vote based off of damage blocked (although I have seen him win some will kills!).

As GW don't make models for 6mm anymore, and ebay prices are sometimes through the roof for old epic stuff (as well as being a bit rare these days), I was looking at alternative miniature companies as I have found a few with some decent looking models for a reasonable price.

Before ordering anything I just wanted to see what anyone elses experiences were like dealing with any of these companies (are they legit, do they deliver on time, etc.), and if there are any other miniature companies to be aware of that I might have missed.
