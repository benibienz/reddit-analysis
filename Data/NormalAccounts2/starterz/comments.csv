In any case, I would never go for a converter filler pen at this price level, no matter how shiny it is. These is something special in piston and vac fillers, I feel that more actual work and engineering is done to produce these pens.

So, apart from these two I would look into Aurora 88, Sailor Pro Gear Realo, and my new grail pen - the [Wahl Eversharp DECOBAND Gold Seal] (http://wahleversharp.com/collection.php?id=43) Now that is an amazing pen.

On the other hand, the writing experience with a good pen, vintage or modern, is something that is far better. I would not even start to compare owning one Parker 51 or Pelikan M200 with owning several chinese pens.
