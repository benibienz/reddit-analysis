Pelikans are my most often sought after pens, due to design and availability where I live. The piston filler has been the best fountain pen feature for me, since the first piston pen I have owned.

I don't own any japanese pens. The Pilot Namiki Yukari Royale Urushi was my grail pen, until I found out that it is a C/C pen. I got very interested in a Sailor 1911 Realo / Pro Gear Realo, when I found out they have a piston filler. I am interested mostly because of the nibs - I have to try and see what many people are talking about ;-)

I am asking for impressions from people who own both a modern Pelikan Souveran (M600, M800) and a Sailor Realo pen. Pros and cons? Nib quality? Piston quality? Which is your favorite after some fair usage time?

Thank you for any replies, I am looking forward to the discussion.",fountainpens,Sailor Realo series vs Pelikan Souveran series,https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/49csnn/sailor_realo_series_vs_pelikan_souveran_series/

For those up-to-date, my trusted contact called again today. Said something about having an ""interesting"" Pelikan for sale, like a 400 with a gold cap. I am thinking...what? Could it be?

Yes, it could. An amazing Pelikan 500NN in great condition, with a medium nib. The price is not worth mentioning, like always.

This is the pen, right [here](http://imgur.com/a/bJubj). What a phenomenal writer. Also, together with two other gold&amp;black pens I have, a Pelikan MK30 and a Parker 51. They look supercool next to each other.

In the album too, my whole current flock of Pelikans: Pelikan 400 Brown Tortoise; Pelikan 140; Pelikan 400NN; Pelikan 500NN; Pelikan MK10; Pelikan MK30 Rolled Gold; Pelikan 120 M&amp;K; Pelikan M200 Dark Grey; Pelikan M200 Black.

New to Linux Mint, but have been running linux periodically since the 2000s (RedHat, Slackware, Mandrake, Ubuntu etc).

I installed Mint to give it a go on my HP Elitebook 6930p, since I ""upgraded"" to Win10 2 weeks ago and was very frustrated. I don't like where Microsoft is going with desktop design and functionality, privacy issues notwithstanding.

Impressions from 2 weeks running 17.2 and 17.3 (since yesterday) are that this is by far my best linux experience as primary desktop. Most of the time, I truly enjoy the OS and the speed of everyday tasks. For example, Google Chrome works much faster (startup, rendering, extensions) than on Windows 7/10.

I had only one problem while upgrading to 17.3 (through terminal of course), that the Configurable Menu applet does not work, so I had to uninstall it and switch back to the default Mint menu. As it is a very fine applet, it would be a pity if it's not to be updated for future Mint versions.

My main issue is the ""Mute"" media keyboard button. On a cold start of the laptop, it works just fine. The led changes color to orange and the OSD shows on the screen with the volume muted. Volume up/down work fine. 

After going into sleep mode/suspend, the led color changes, the sound is muted, it is just that this is not recognized by Cinnamon in the volume status icon or through OSD. Volume up/down buttons work fine, with OSD.

This happens exactly the same way on 17.2 and 17.3. As this is the most used media shortcut on my keyboard, please help me with some instructions on how to resolve this issue.

[EDIT] Description of the issue re-tested and clarified.

Luck is very important, as I come to understand, in the world of fountain pen collectors. When luck strikes, you also need to be prepared to spend your last lunch money, a week before your new paycheck.

Taking the above into consideration, got a call about a pen I might possibly like. ""Meet tomorrow, 1 PM sharp.""

Meeting occurs as scheduled. Out of a pocket and into daylight flashes a vintage Pelikan 400 Gunther Wagner in brown tortoise! Aoaoaoao!

[The pen.](http://i.imgur.com/GrlwfGN.jpg)

According to the nib, I think it is the second issue of the pen, most probably 1954-1956. It needed me. It needed my care. 30 EUR? Please take my money.

After a thorough flushing and all-around cleaning, I can say that it is an amazing writer with a BB expressive nib. It needed just a bit of smoothing, and now writes with the character of a 60 year old pen. Amazing feeling.

I cancelled a purchase I made yesterday, and got the refund today. I knew it had to be for a reason.

A local pen dealer called me in the morning, with an offer. A beautiful black-gold Parker 51 Aerometric MK I. I have been looking for a nice 51 for quite some time, as they are not very frequent where I live (Macedonia). He also tells me he might have a Pelikan I can look at.

We meet, and the Pelikan is a mint 140 in the original box and documentation. Come on! :-)

Here they are, both. [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/CzGW27g.jpg?1)

I got both for 50 EUR, which I think is the deal of the year for me.

Can't wait to take them home and put them into regular circulation. I checked two pens on my ""grail"" list, yay!

Please check the [Album](http://imgur.com/a/DP6Qj#0)

This is going to be my first restoration project. I would like to try fixing the nib myself. What would be good text/video resources to go through and learn about the tools and skills necessary? I would of course test my skills many times before I go after the Montblanc nib :-) As for a nibmeister, I live in Macedonia, Europe - there is noone as far as I know. I am thinking of taking the pen to a skilled goldsmith - is this something you would recommend? A regionally based nibmeister is also an option.

Another thing, apart from eBay, please suggest other ways to get a replacement cap for the pen? Is there a cap from another Montblanc pen that will fit, in case I am not able to find an original one?
