33,"This is exactly what I am trying to get across, thanks man! Its that instinct to know if someone is steering you in the wrong direction or actually helpful.

Also, google search will only go so far - you do need to know what tools to use when a more difficult error appears (such as sysinternal tools - like procmon). Not all errors are actually the problem.

An example is, I had a small business server 2011 with exchange that I had rebooted after applying windows updates. When it rebooted it, it would fail to mount the exchange database. Logic dictates its something with the updates.... wrong. I checked event logs and saw 1 error saying write delayed or error reading disk.
It was this that lead me to think that there might be a fault with the raid, but the raid card showed everything ok. After launching the windows raid software, I saw a particular drive had lots of errors reading, but the drive still hadn’t failed. IBM was useless as tits on a bull.... so with my experience and after checking all the other drives for errors (via the GUI) I forcefully removed the disk to initiate a failure. All of a sudden everything worked and the raid said it was degraded... it appeared to be reading bad sectors from that disk, but hadn't actually failed. No amount of google will tell you the direction, but as a windows technician you need to pickup all the bread crumbs even if they aren’t the same shape as the others.

35,"Well there is a special art, and you either have it or you don't. I believe I have it. Not only do you need to know what to search for, you also need to know how to mentally filter out the crap from the possible solutions.

I usually try and gather a sense of what everyone is reporting, most of the time its never the first solution that presents its self. Then based on my experience I will know the direction I need to steer in to hone in on a solution.

You need to search concisely, and with out the extra jargon, but enough to make it so mr google can search for key words. 

Think of google like a keyword search, also you can use + in your search to guarantee the word appears, or - if you don't want the word to appear

i.e configure exchange android sony experia z -apple -iphone

As mentioned in another comment, if it is an error message, try and condense the error message and ensure you don't have any hostnames or ip addresses that relate to your system in particular

i.e the trust relationship between domainsysz.com failed to join the exchange hostname.local program

I would instead search for

trust relationship between failed to join the exchange program

You see if I have condensed it and remove key things relating to my servers/sites. Also if you can include the event ID (if it is a windows error in event logs) this will also help.

You can also search just a particular site

site:experts-exchange.com windows 2012 R2 trust relationship between failed to join the exchange program

Also try and include specific operating system information or version numbers, as above I put Windows 2012 R2, which will help bring results with information pertaining to Windows 2012 R2.
