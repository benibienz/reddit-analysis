55,"Got on the 8 southbound at Kingsway in the middle of the day. It was mostly empty, I went and sat at the back, and across the aisle and a few seats up from me was a drunk homeless guy passed out. The bus started going and he fell forward, and an uncapped bottle of Listerine started pouring out all over him and the floor. That somehow woke him up enough to sit back up and take a swig of what was left of the bottle before he passed back out. Bus took the corner onto 109th a little hard and he wound up leaning heavy into the window, headfirst, spiderwebbing the whole thing.

Closer to downtown he woke up and sat in the priority bench at the front of the bus. A lady with a seeing-eye dog got on at Gov't Center, and the guy kept trying to pet it. She was really good about it and very politely kept asking him to please not touch the dog. Guy wound up getting into an argument with the driver over that, and they had to call in another bus to take everyone else because he wouldn't leave.


Also back when I'd catch the 151 to school, it wound up being up to 20 minutes late getting to my stop (on the north end of the route, nothing but residential between my stop and the northmost stop) on cold winter days, and 5-10 minutes early most other days. Wound up usually just walking 15-20 minutes to a stop with more busses so I wouldn't have to deal with it, especially on cold days... easier for me to stay warm by walking for 20 minutes than by standing around at a stop.

Nowadays I'm living on the south side and find that the general culture of bus etiquette is... non existent. Lots of shoving to get on first, plenty of people (usually kids) stopping (and blocking) in the middle of the aisle to chat with friend that are sitting, people shoving their way on to busses and trains before people can get off, absolutely no concern for anyone else. Not that this doesn't happen on the north side, but I find it to be much worse on the south side.

You're correct that one broken string isn't enough to diagnose it without seeing the guitar, but it's not like I'm recommending he buy a brand new neck or anything ridiculous. It takes seconds to check for, and only slightly longer than that to smooth out.

Besides, there was a reason I used the word ""probably"", and offered a few other solutions.

Why waste strings trying to ""observe a trend"" when it's trivial to check for?",2016-03-10 21:09:12+00:00,d0v6x2b,5.0,t1_d0uupfd,15750.0,Guitar
92,"Typically, guitar strings don't just break - usually something has to be done to cause it to weaken in the first place. But unless you were tuning it much higher than it should be tuned to, it's most likely not something you intentionally did - could just be age, a sharp spot on the tuner like I mentioned in my other post, a flawed string, etc.

I wouldn't worry about it unless it's a consistent pattern of the same string breaking at the same spot, then it's more than likely a burr.

However I should mention that you should really replace all the strings at once. If you want to use a slightly cheaper set of strings Ernie Ball strings are fine, and I think the Not Even Slinky set is 10-46, but double check that - they print the string gauges on the packaging. D'addarios aren't exactly expensive but they do cost $1-2 more than EBs.

There's knowing how to adjust it, then learning where it should be adjusted to and how it effects the rest of the setup. Action is pretty easy, I prefer to have it as low as possible without buzzing but it's largely to taste. Intonation is a little more complex but there's some great guides out there as well. If you're using the same gauge of strings, though, neither should need an adjustment unless they weren't properly set in the first place.

110,"They're both very thin so I don't know that one would be better than the other for small hands. The Ibanez neck is shaped more like a rounded rectangle - flat across the back with a fairly abrupt angle on the sides. They Jackson on the other hand will be a bit thicker in the middle but taper more subtly on the sides. It's not quite as extreme a difference as I'm making it out to be but definitely noticeable. 

As far as neck length and tone are concerned - the neck length doesn't directly affect the tone, but rather affects the string tension which makes a tonal difference. If you use the same gauge of string on both necks, the shorter neck will have less tension, which gives a bit more of a ""flubby"" sound. More tension gives it a bit tighter, more trebly sound, which for lower tunings really helps with note definition. Plus the higher tension prevents the note from going as sharp when picking heavily. Think of the differences between Mastodon and Periphery, as far as their low notes sound. 

Alternately, a longer scale allows you to keep the same string tension while using a thinner string, which will have more harmonic content and again better note definition. It also makes it easier to set intonation, as thinner strings don't require the saddle to be moved as far back. 

Again, the difference is relatively subtle, but noticeable. ",2016-02-21 14:07:25+00:00,d083fv0,5.0,t1_d07ycys,20168.0,Guitar

159,"Not quite. The ""acoustic sound"" doesn't really translate to pickups - magnetic pickups (the standard for guitars) sound quite different, and piezo pickups (which are commonly used for classicals as they work with nylon strings, but have various other uses) have a different, unique sound. Acoustics sound the way they do heavily due to the design, the materials, and the way they project their sound.

Acoustics in general don't tend to work too well with Rocksmith - not only do the pickups not always translate well to the note detection, they have a drastically reduced range of frets (even with a cutaway it's not always easy to reach past 16 or 17 - whereas the vast majority of electrics have more-or-less unimpeded access to 21, 22, or sometimes 24 or more frets - and depending on the track, they can all get used), and are much more difficult to bend on due to the higher gauge strings (11s or 12s are normal for an acoustic in E, whereas an electric guitar is usually strung with 9s or 10s for E).

Using a semihollow guitar (think Gretsch or similar) would work well with Rocksmith, but not sound like an acoustic.

In regards to your original question, either guitar will work equally well with Rocksmith. Humbuckers may get picked up a little bit better but it's not a massive difference. Outside of Rocksmith, single coils will be noisier when using distortion (and I believe the noise gating in RS is what causes the detection issues) but it's manageable. As far as quality, both guitars will be fairly similar. They're fairly low-end, but the Chinese factory that Fender's been using lately for its Squiers (as well as the more recent Jackson JS models) has been doing a solid job. Personally I'd spend $150 more and grab one of the Classic Vibe strats, they've been getting some killer reviews and in my experience slaying the Squier Standards. ESP (and LTD) is a brand that I'm a huge supporter of, but I can't really recommend any of their non-Made in Korea models (or better) over the newer Squier CVs and Jackson JS models.",2015-11-30 15:04:31+00:00,cxhxm2s,5.0,t1_cxhwoay,1999.0,rocksmith

165,"I've got an opinion that may end up being a bit unpopular, but bear with me.

A Tiny Terror (not so much the Micro IMO) will get you a particular sound MUCH better than the Vypyr ever could. No question.

However, you say you're a new player - that particular sound may not necessarily be a very useful sound for you, especially if you want to play Blind Guardian - the Orange sound is a bit more vintagey than what Blind Guardian gets (they run through ENGLs last I checked).

The Peavey, on the other hand, won't excel at getting you that Orange tone by any means (or the tube tone for that matter) but it will get you a very broad range of usable sounds.

Take the time to sit down with the manual and read through it, it definitely does seem like the most user-friendly amp.

Rather than using a preset, I'd recommend starting off just with the 6505+ model on the high-gain channel - no stompbox, no effects - and pregain/bass/mid/treble at around noon, and postgain adjusted to a comfortable volume. Adjust to taste, but this should give you a decent starting point for metal. The 6505 (and the 6534) will likely be your go-to amp sims for modern metal, although the XXX can hold its own as well. The Butcher will give you more of an old-school kind of tone, more in the same neighbourhood as an Orange (although, obviously, not exactly like an Orange). Think more Iron Maiden.

That would be my two cents. At least, give that a shot before taking the amp back. If it's just not cutting it for you, don't feel bad about swapping it out - but keep in mind that until you get your fundamental techniques down you're not going to have great tone regardless of the amp you're going through.",2015-11-17 18:21:44+00:00,cx3j9di,1.0,t3_3t5ipx,18690.0,metalguitar

I do just want to throw in some words of... caution? Warning, maybe? OP, this isn't directed at you by any means.

First off, not ever teacher is right for every student - there's many, many different approaches to any instrument, some of which work better for some students than others. And of course not necessarily every teacher knows every approach (if there is such a thing as knowing EVERY approach) let alone an approach that works best for you. If a teacher doesn't work out, don't discard the entire idea of lessons - find another teacher who may work better for you.

Secondly, a teacher isn't a magic solution. Aside from the odd technique adjustment that can provide some instant results, nothing happens overnight. You will very rarely go to a lesson and immediately become a better teacher. What a teacher can do is show you (what they feel is) the best thing for you to practice to see improvement - it's on you as a student to actually take that lesson home and work on it and grow from it. 

In my experience as a teacher many students expect to be able to put in half an hour of work every week and grow as a bass player, and it never works. A teacher can tell you what you have to do to improve, but it's on you to do it.

You can go a lot further with a guitar that plays well and an amp that only sounds okay than and amp that sounds a little better than okay and a guitar that sucks to play. Especially since you have Rocksmith and therefore a way to amplify it.

There's more than a few amps in the $100-150 range that will get you by until you kinda figure out where you wanna go with it. A Fender Mustang I will run about $130 and gives a pretty wide array of tones. The Roland Cube amps are pretty well regarded, I think there's one or two models around that price as well.

If you have an iOS device there's a few cheap input devices you can buy and run software amps like JamUp/Bias or Amplitube, but those are difficult for jamming without headphones. Fun for travelling, though.

As for your other question, in theory you should be able to trust a used guitar from a shop, but that's not always the case. Plus there's always the issue of why it was sold in the first place - there are guitars out there that, regardless of the setup, are just not well built.

I just keep it clipped to my headstock and tune to it rather than what's displayed on the screen - gives me a lot more accuracy, leading to fewer missed notes in-game.

Other than that, don't get discouraged. Learning guitar is a gradual journey and it's not always possible to tell if you're improving or not without comparing your current and previous abilities back-to-back. It's also very easy to plateau and go through long periods - days, weeks, months even - where you just aren't improving. It happens to everyone, and if you keep pushing and trying new things, you'll break through.

Speaking to that, try new things. You won't get very far if you only stick to the songs in the game that you like. Trying different genres will more often than not open you to new techniques and help you improve.

208,"I don't know that I'd call tube amps ""better"", particularly when it comes to bedroom levels. Lower-wattage tube amps are inherently a bit fizzy sounding and a large part of the charm of a tube amp is how it responds to a strong signal - both of which are counter to what a bedroom player wants. A solid state amp works better (note: not necessarily sounds better) at low volumes - that is, it sounds fairly consistent from low to high volume, until it gets pushed too hard. Tube amps on the other hand are designed to work best when pushed to or past that limit.

That said, I wouldn't necessarily avoid low-wattage tube amps for bedroom playing. I just picked up a Peavey Valveking II 50-watt myself (swaps down to 2 watts) which works pretty well for bedroom playing, although it sounds much better when cranked. It may be one for you to check out, loaded with features. And with a decent cab like yours it should sound solid. 

One thing to mention is that the Blackstar ID:60 is not a tube amp - it's a digital modelling amp. I was really impressed by the ID series overall, but if you're looking for tube specifically, it isn't. Not a bad choice, though.

The Blackstar HT-5 Metal sounds pretty solid and is all tube. I found the regular HT-5 amps to be lacking in gain - and I use relatively low gain. I had the Gain cranked and a decently high gain setting on my OD pedal.

I've liked all the 6505MH samples I've heard, that one should do you well if you're not too picky about your clean channel - it's kind of lacking.

The Dark Terror is fun but not super versatile - I personally really like having a clean channel. I've only played the full Dark Terror, and while I got some killer tones out of it, I felt really limited. If you're a one sound at a time kind of guy though it might not be a bad choice. You won't necessarily need an OD for it to get metal tones, but it's nice to have one to tighten up your tone as a clean boost.

The Marshall DSL amps are pretty fun, a bit mushy on the low end but that may have been the speaker in the combo I was playing.

The Hughes &amp; Kettner Tubemeister amps are a little pricier but I've liked what I've heard from them.

215,"Buy the one out of those three that plays best. Fenders (and Squiers) can be pretty all over the place - I played a dozen Teles ranging from Squier Bullets to Fender American Deluxes before settling on the Mexican-made Fender Deluxe Nashville Telecaster.

Assuming they all play equally well, I'd personally go for the MIM Standard (assuming it is a Standard you're looking at, there are a number of Mexican-made Teles out there). I prefer the more modern 6-saddle bridge as well as the flat sides on the bridge plate itself, plus I'm not big on the tinted neck of the Classic Vibe. 

However the Classic Vibe Teles have (IMO) a much nicer looking body finish, and the ones I've played have consistently outplayed the MIM Standards.

217,"I've got some of the Dunlop stuff (the polish and lemon oil). I use that along with some clean dry rags. Using microfiber cloths would be a better call than just any rags.

If it's got a rosewood fretboard, he should be applying oil (mineral oil, naphtha, or any product made specifically for guitars - avoid most plant-based oils, like actual lemon oil, olive oil, etc.) once every 6 months - year, if the fretboard is starting to look dry. This keeps it from splintering, cracking, shifting, etc. Maple fretboards - so long as they have a finish on them - should only be cleaned with naphtha, and that's only if you can't get it clean with a dry rag. Unfinished ones should be cleaned with as little naphtha as possible. Most other materials can be treated like rosewood.

As far as cleaning the body, it depends on the finish - if it's nitrocellulose using something that evaporates quickly like naphtha is best, if a dry rag can't get it clean. Ditto if it's an unfinished or oil-finished body although those are rare. If it's some kind of poly, pretty much anything is fine to use, unless it's a satin finish - then pretty much any attempt at cleaning it will shine it up.

The nice thing about high end basses is that they tend to be made with wood selected for its stability, moisture content, etc. so they'll be more stable and less prone to warping, drying, and so on.

Advise him to keep it in a case when not in use and store it somewhere with relatively stable temperatures and humidity. Once he's done playing, he should wipe down every part he's come in contact with (body, neck, strings, bridge, etc.) with a clean rag to prevent any corrosion or buildup.

Of course, it's a bass - it's going to be played. Let him play it. Let it accumulate some battle scars. Unless he's doing some REALLY stupid shit, it's not gonna end up getting irreparably damaged. Besides, it's his bass, there's no reason for you to be concerned.

First thing you want to do is let the bass sit and readjust to the new tension for a couple hours. Once it's normalized, adjust the neck bow (Gary Willis has a [great tutorial](http://www.garywillis.com/pages/bass/bassmanual/setupmanual.html) on that - basically hold down the string at the first ""fret"" and at the end of the neck, then tap the string in the middle. You want just a little bit of motion). It sounds to me like you've got some neck bow - the middle of the fretboard is higher than the ends. Once you've got a little bit of relief you can adjust the action.

240,"I've found my ""perfect pick"" a half dozen times. My tastes and technique keep changing and evolving.

Currently it's the [Gravity Big Mini Sunrise 3mm with Master Finish and grip circles](http://i.imgur.com/qLa0aOA.jpg?1) (available [here](http://gravitypicks.com/collections/picks/products/sunrise?variant=921382503) starting at $5, mine cost me $7 apiece with a minimum of 6 as that particular grip pattern, which I prefer, is Custom Shop only). They're not too expensive, tend to outlast an equivalent dollar value in ""normal"" picks, and are super comfy to play. Plus they look awesome.

Before that I was hooked on the [Winspear Broadsword](http://www.winspearpicks.com/product/sandstorm-broadsword) (known previously as the Shiv XL then), typically in the Sandstorm material (although I really liked the [Stealth](http://www.winspearpicks.com/product/stealth-broadsword) ones too). They're very unique to play with, starting with a thick blank (5mm in this case, but they run the gamut from like 2-8mm) and tapering down to a thin point. It gives you a very interesting grip and can be quite comfortable once you get used to them. A little pricey (around 6.25-6.50 GBP, so just shy of $10 USD) but last even longer than the Gravity picks. It helps that I am friends with the owner and while that didn't help me much with the cost (conversion and shipping from the UK to Canada sucks) it's great to support a small business like his.

Other than that, I've been big on tortex Jazz picks (specifically the [Traynor ones from L&amp;M](http://www.long-mcquade.com/files/12586/lg_TP423T150.JPG)), [Dunlop Ultex Jazz picks](https://images.static-thomann.de/pics/prod/238025.jpg), and the [John Petrucci signature picks](http://www.gearnuts.com/images/items/1800/427PJP-xlarge.jpg). All have been good (or even great) but have always left me looking for something a bit more.

Honestly, I feel it's worth it to spend a bit more on a pick that really works for you. The majority of the time, it's your primary source of input to your guitar - it's how you interact with it on a fundamental level. Find something comfortable that allows you to play the most expressively.",2015-09-30 14:15:43+00:00,cvja62v,1.0,t3_3mydlq,9123.0,Guitar

Honestly, I'd recommend having the bridge pickup selected basically all the time while playing RS. It's (typically) higher output and and treblier than the neck pickup and just overall works so much better when it comes to note detection. On top of that, having the guitar's volume and tone knobs cranked help too.

Don't get me wrong, in the real world there are many scenarios where the tones you can get from the other pickups, or changing the guitar's output volume or tone, are extremely useful and pleasant - but when it comes to Rocksmith, tone is secondary.

My instinct is that you're playing in Open E or similar, where one (or more) strings get tuned up from Standard - and I'm willing to be that's the string that's breaking. I'd advise buying a lighter gauge string for the ones that tend to snap (probably the next lightest available one - juststrings.com and guitarstringsonline are both good sites for singles, and they both carry Elixirs).

If it's not a string being tuned above standard, it's possible you've got a burr on the nut or bridge causing the string to snap - does the string snap at either of those two points consistently?

One thing I've found (at least in my experience) is that strings really aren't ""one size fits all"". Different gauges work best for different tunings, and once you've found your ideal tensions it's not too hard to use a tension calculator to  ""optimize"" your set. Of course, this leads down the rabbit hole of custom sets and different materials and all sorts of stuff, and it can distract from focussing on playing... but at the same time it's nice to have the set of strings that works best for you and your tuning.",2015-09-16 14:26:39+00:00,cv3hxlt,1.0,t3_3l5tfm,9091.0,Guitar

[**Wilderun - Sleep at the Edge of the Earth (2015)**](https://wilderun.bandcamp.com/track/bite-the-wound-ash-memory-part-iii) - I just discovered this band a couple weeks ago and it's on top of my current rotation. I'm a huge fan of folk metal (and similar) so it's right up my alley to start with, and the lack of pipes and hurdy-gurdys along with the addition of slide guitar help it, to my ears, stand out from the pack. They have a very epic sound, lots of sweeping orchestral parts. There's been a lot of comparisons made to Opeth, and while I can see the similarities, Wilderun's clean parts are much folkier and less jazz, and for the most part their heavy parts are much heavier. The general dynamic is shared, though. Overall, I just fucking love this album. It's catchy, it's heavy, it's epic, and I just keep listening to it over and over again.

[**Korpiklaani - Noita (2015)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzvuecOLRzY) - Sticking with the folk metal theme... I've always enjoyed these guys, but none of their albums have really stuck with me. They're the kinda band that if they come up on shuffle I'll (usually) turn it up, but I'll rarely go out of my way to listen to it. For some reason this album just feels more... listenable. It makes me want to jump around and dance and push people. The Mony Mony cover is arguably the weakest link, but aside from that I just think it's a very fun album.


[**Anciients - Heart of Oak \(2013\)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hE3jWIaPAw) - This is the album I WISH Mastodon has made after Crack the Skye, or The Sword had made... at like any point.

So in most cases, no, typically those djenters couldn't take ""any regular old 6-string"" and tuned down without making some significant compromise. In most cases it's easier and more preferable to get a guitar that has all the right specs but 8 strings than a baritone 6 or a Bass VI that has the right scale length, but otherwise doesn't work as well for metal.

Although I did just notice you mentioned A Standard - a lot of those guys are tuning way further down than that (8 strings are tuned to F# Standard, and many go even further down to Drop D). A Standard works fine on pretty well any 6-string, but it's not too common for djent.

Of course that logic doesn't follow suit for any other vol/vol/tone config I've seen, either from ESP (the KH models) or from anyone else.

If it doesn't work for you, it's relatively trivial to swap the two pots - pull the knobs off, remove the nut and washer, and just swap locations, assuming there's enough play in the wiring (which there should be).

I personally would probably go for a somewhat more drastic change, and replace the ""Bridge Volume"" pot with a killswitch (or something - maybe series/parallel, maybe coil tap, just so long as it's a toggle) and the ""Neck Volume"" pot with master volume - but that's to suit my own playing style.",2015-09-04 14:51:26+00:00,cuqgqvq,1.0,t3_3jmccj,2805.0,Guitar

The first way is to look at the strings you normally buy, and order singles that are close to that. Keep in mind that flats are stiffer than rounds, so if you normally prefer a 100 for a low E you may want to try using a .095. But using the same gauges as normal is a great starting point.

The other option is to use a string tension calculator, like [stringulator.com](http://www.stringulator.com/) or [stringtensionpro.com](http://stringtensionpro.com/) (which is D'addario's official calculator). Figure out what tension you like best (easiest way to do this is pick a string and tune it up and down by half steps until it's more-or-less got the right amount of tension for you), then figure out what other strings will give you that amount of tension for the tuning you use.

It's a lot less complicated than it sounds, trust me. 

Personally, I like between 38-42 pounds of tension per string. I've played 45 pounds and it's definitely on the heavy side, I actually found it a bit fatiguing. I wouldn't go any higher than 45-48 pounds, or lower than 35 pounds.",2015-09-04 14:16:53+00:00,cuqfhfq,4.0,t1_cuqeatp,2144.0,Bass

322,"Mostly inconsistency. While you're never guaranteed that any guitar you purchase will be free from defects, Agiles don't go through the same level of quality control and setup that other brands do. As a result, you have to be very diligent to check that everything is fully and properly functional, and if it's not you have to make sure you take advantage of their free returns (assuming you're within continental US/Canada).

They cut a few corners like that to allow for a wider range of specs and lower prices.

Personally, I'd rather pay a little bit more and get something of similar quality (ie anything from the same factory from a different brand - Schecter, LTD Deluxe, PRS SE, etc.) that I can test and examine and play before I actually purchase it.

However, if you want a more unique configuration of specs, they're definitely the most economical way to go.

The other option I can think of is the [Carvin TL70](http://www.carvinguitars.com/catalog/guitars/tl70). It does come stock with 2 humbuckers, but if you called them they may be able to help you out with an SSS configuration (for an upcharge, of course).

If you want a more hands-on project Warmoth offers 7-string T and S-style bodies. You'd have to either compromise on their 4+3 headstock or get their paddle headstock and cut it to shape, but you'd be able to get a fairly high-quality guitar (with a bit of work).

330,"Tune to whatever works best for you in that musical context.

I played in a tech death band that tuned to C# - so I tuned to C# standard. This let me use the same fingerings for riffs as guitar, since that style of music lent itself very well to having 3 instruments in unison.

I played in a folk metal band that tuned to E Standard, I tuned to B standard on a 5 because occasionally I would want to hit the D (and occasionally, B and C). This allowed me to play some parts an octave below guitars (as is usual), the same octave as guitars, and at some times an octave below guitars which was an easy way to add variety and dynamics.

I played in jazz bands in school for years. I would always tune to standard, even if the soloist was a Bb instrument, because it was easier on me to read sheet music without having to transpose. Plus it was EXTREMELY rare that I would need to hit an Eb.

I played in a pop punk band. They tuned to Drop Db and Eb Standard, and occasionally would do either one of those capoed at the first fret. I tuned to Drop Db for the entire set because that's what worked best for me in that situation.

A general rule of thumb is you typically want to be able to play the lowest note the guitarists hit an octave down. If they hit a low D, you may want to be in D Standard or Drop D. If they never go below an F or a G, you'll be fine in Standard. But really, do whatever works best.

Obviously regardless of whatever tuning you use, be in tune - it doesn't do anyone any good if you're all tuned to E Standard but you happen to be 10 cents sharp. Tune to a piano if there is one in the band, and a tuner if there isn't.

Unless you're going for a 50s Motown thump, your old strings sound like shit. Change them and learn to use an EQ.

In the context of an electric instrument like a bass, tonewood is more-or-less bullshit. You'll find just as much variation between two pieces of wood from the same species as you will between two pieces from other species - I firmly believe that any tonal characteristics of wood stem mostly from the density and weight of the piece, and that most if not all of those tonal qualities can be EQed in or out.

It wound up looking alright, but when we practiced it the first time the guitarist in question stuck it up too high...

And of course, I couldn't find anywhere to order in a single black chrome locking tuner... He wound up buying me a single tuner to replace it. It's still on there, six or seven years later. 

Now that I think of it, I've done done damage to that guitar as well... A coupe years ago, and I'm not entirely sure on the details because I didn't notice the damage right away, my guitar must have fallen strings-first against a desk corner or something, because there was a distinct G-string-sized impression in the seventh fret just to the side of where the G would normally land.

Jackson's Pro series is also up there

There's really not much else out there at around that price point that can touch them. They're very consistent, they play great, they tend to use good quality hardware.

I tend to prefer LTD Deluxe models to Schecters, but lately Schecter's lineup has been destroying LTD's. Just an all-out better array of options pretty well clear across the board.

I honestly do think though that in most cases, a comparably spec'd LTD will outperform a Schecter, as in my experience the QC tolerance LTD's got contracted is much tighter. Their higher-end midrange stuff seems more comparable (sigs especially - aside from some first-run issues that Schecter handled themselves, the KM7s are fantastic).

I think grabbing a head + cab now would be the smart move so you can take advantage of the flexibility... if you get a combo now and want to upgrade to a halfstack, you'll have to grab the head and cab later.

The first one was memorable because of how much respect I lost. Children of Bodom was doing a meet-and-greet and after everything was said and done, I went upstairs to go say hi to them - I wasn't a big fan, but I figured I might as well. Alexi Laiho gave me the most disgusted look and a limp-wristed pathetic handshake and just walked off, the rest of the band was nowhere to be seen. Firmly cemented him as a douchebag in my mind. On the bright side, I met my now-wife for the first time in person there, so it wasn't all bad.

The other one was without question the greatest interaction with a big-name musician I have ever had. Victor Wooten was doing a clinic, and I was there solely as a fan. After the clinic, he stationed himself by the front desk checkout area so everyone could line up for photos, autographs, etc. Since I was staff I hung out over by him behind the counter the entire time, and got to idly chat with him and listen in on him chatting with all of his fans. The man is easily one of the most down-to-earth, nicest people I've ever met. After the line of people had gone he hung around for a good half hour shooting the shit with all of us.

472,"I've found PitchPerfect to be a very accurate, fairly lightweight software tuner. It's a free download. I prefer it to the ingame tuner myself.

Intonation is pretty easy to do depending on your bridge. The gist of it is that you adjust the saddle - specifically, its distance from the nut - until the 12th fret is exactly in tune with the 12th fret harmonic.

Essentially, tune the string using the 12th fret harmonic. You want it as exact as possible. Then fret the string at the 12th fret, being careful not to bend the note, and allow the note to settle. If the note is sharp, you need to increase the string length by moving the saddle away from the nut. If it's flat, the saddle needs to be moved towards the nut. Retune the string - it'll be a bit out - and check again. Repeat until both notes are in tune, then repeat for the remaining strings.

How you adjust the saddle varies depending on your bridge. [Gibson-style bridges](http://www.stewmac.com/product/images/6137/Nashville_Tune-o-matic_Bridge.jpg) (Tune-o-matics) have a small screw, typically on the headstock-side of the bridge, that you adjust from. [Fender Strat-style bridges](http://www.jvguitars.com/images/my69CustomShop1969StratPAT-PEND-1200.jpg) have a screw on the other side of the bridge. [Telecaster bridges](https://www.allparts.com/assets/images/products/TB-5120-001-web.jpg) are similar to Strat bridges, but with fewer screws - although require more compromise and a bit more patience. Floyd Rose and similar bridges involve a 3rd-party tool, satanic summoning ritual, and/or the patience of a saint.

473,"&gt;I'm not sure about specs to be honest. I should do more research because I have no idea how they affect a guitar. If you know some resources that would be great.

Definitely a good idea. Specifically, figure out whether you want something with a floating bridge (like the Floyd on the one you linked) or a fixed bridge. A lot of people hate floating bridges as they have a bit of a learning curve and can't easily be changed to a different tuning.

&gt;Would there be any non mass produced guitars in my price range? (doesn't sound like it).

Definitely not. My point was mostly unless you're buying something boutique, a new guitar is not going to hold its value. Even then you will always lose money on a new guitar, with the exception of those few that turn out to be collector's items - although those are few and far between.

&gt;What other guitars should I be looking at? I'm just looking for a guitar that gives more of a metal tone, that will last for some time and that I can tune down (while having a guitar tech help).

Arguably anything with humbuckers and a fixed bridge will satisfy those conditions. I'd recommend any of ESP's LTD Deluxe models (they end with a 1000 or 1001 model number) or Signature models (the ones that end in 600 at lowest), Schecter SLS or Hellraiser guitars (but watch out for ones with the Sustainiac or other gimmicks that may not be worth it to you), or Jackson X-series or Pro-series guitars (the Pro series is a step up from the X models) to start.

474,"It'll hold it's value similarly to any other mass produced guitar - as soon as it leaves the store you'll be able to sell it for roughly 60% of current new value, give or take.

As far as that guitar in specific - what draws you to the Sustainiac? The Hellraiser C1s are not bad guitars by any means, but the Sustainiac adds a couple hundred bucks and if you're not buying it specifically for that feature it's wasted money.

If the Sustainiac is a must-have, that C1 is a good buy. Otherwise I'd say grab the non-Sustainiac version. 

To be honest, I'd recommend an LTD over a Schecter - I find the LTD neck carve to be more comfortable (the exception being the Schecter SLS neck).

478,"[These are the ones that get the most play.](http://i.imgur.com/DepDKBA.jpg)

My ESP LTD H-1001 is my main guitar by far. This thing plays, feels, and sounds phenomenal. It was my first ""real"" guitar, after upgrading from some beginner-grade starter electrics (BC Rich Metal Master Warlock which is mostly destroyed - literally - and an LTD M-10 which I still have), and the first electric I bought flat out with my own cash back in '06 or '07 (as opposed to financing with some help from mom and dad). I picked it up with my staff discount from AXE Music when I taught there, and paid only a couple bucks more for it than they're going for used right now. If there's any guitar that will never leave my stable, it's this one. It's mostly stock - one of the locking tuners broke (thumbscrew got snapped off by my old guitarist who was borrowing it) so he replaced it with a non-locking one, and one of the nuts on the bridge (opposite the saddle adjustment screw) fell off, but TonePros sent me a new bridge to replace it with (I later found that teeny nut and repaired the bridge).

My main bass is the Fender Aerodyne Jazz. Again, it's all stock (except for a replaced nut) and was picked up through my staff discount. Crazy versatile, sounds great for everything from jazz to pop punk to death metal. Plays great as well, but has some weight to it despite being basswood. I've had this thing since bass college, about 6 or 7 years ago - got it late 2008/early 2009.

Next up is my Telebastard. Easily my most modified guitar. Started off as a bone-stock [Fender Nashville Deluxe Telecaster](https://www.fender.com/guitars/telecaster/deluxe-nashville-tele/0135300309.html#q=nashville&amp;start=1) I picked up brand new from L&amp;M last year with my tax return, but I've replaced the bridge (the vintage-style 6-saddle bridge is pure crap) with a MiM Standard Tele bridge, and the neck and bridge pickups with Tele Hot Rails (plus a black cover for the mid pickup to match), and at some point it's getting locking tuners. It needs an electronics overhaul, though, I kept the original 250k pots in there and I'm finding that I do actually need that extra bit of top-end. It's set up for D and gets used primarily for some folk/black/doom metal crap I play.

The last one in the picture is my newest acquisition, an older (2002/03 iirc) MiK ESP LTD M-102. My understanding is that before the Deluxe series got introduced, all of ESP's LTD models came out of Korea and were built to the same level of quality, but different levels of hardware - import Duncan Design vs ""real"" Duncans or EMGs, basswood vs mahogany vs 'hog with a flame/quilt veneer, etc. This one's one of the lower end ones, but still plays fantastically for what it is. I've tossed an EMG 81/60 set in there along with a Tremol-No and use it as my Blind Guardian Eb guitar. It's stupid fun to play, the ESP neck carve is easily my favorite. This was an early anniversary present from my wife that I ruined the surprise of, haha.

I've got a few other guitars that didn't make it into the photo.

[My other two basses](http://i.imgur.com/2OKmsN1.jpg). 

The first one is a Squier Vintage Modified Fretless Jazz Bass. It was dirt cheap and plays pretty damn good. Picked it up back at AXE because it was like $200 after my discount, I needed a 4-string for school, and I really wanted a fretless. The pickups are crap but it's fun to play.

Beside that is my main 5-string (which doesn't get as much love lately), an Ibanez SR505. I beat the hell out of it doing weekly gigs in my folk metal band in 2008-09. It sounds and plays awesome as well.

[Everyone's gotta have an acoustic too.](http://i.imgur.com/n7ZZg0o.jpg) Mine's a Seagull  Original Mahogany Deluxe S6. Solid 'hog top, laminated 'hog sides, the most mahogany-looking maple neck I've ever seen. Got it dirt cheap ($300 with a solid hsc) used from L&amp;M, wife paid for half as an early birthday present for me last year. I'm terrible at acoustic but I think it sounds alright. Fun to play, I really like it and would recommend a Seagull any day.

Other than that, I've got an [LTD M-10](http://i.imgur.com/yGkbpYK.jpg) that was my second electric. I bought it off a friend in high school after realizing how terrible my BC Rich was (and noticing the neck was warping like crazy...). It's set up for B right now and used exclusively for fucking around. It's not a bad guitar, Korean made, but it's definitely low end.

Seymour Duncan, DiMarzio, or any of the other third-party brands are easy to find and great options as well.

My recommendation would likely be Warmoth, although it can get pricey. You'll have a fantastic guitar with some work.",2015-06-29 15:43:13+00:00,csmgplw,1.0,t3_3bip82,646.0,Guitar
503,"On mobile so I'll probably mangle this explanation...


The current Harvest Moon situation is... Odd to say the least. Natsume, who was doing the NA localizations, stopped working with Marvelous, the actual developers but still owns the Harvest Moon name. So the last one or two Harvest Moon games to come out have been entirely separate from the previous games, as of The Lost Valley. However Marvelous is doing the localization themselves now, releasing the games under the title Story of Seasons. SoS is actually pretty good - similar aesthetically to the last ""true"" HM game, A New Beginning, but a lot less... Boring as all hell. 

If you want something on the slower paced side but still fun, Story of Seasons is great. Just avoid anything named Harvest Moon from here on out, add Natsume has been doing a shit job. 

Other than that, Luigi's Mansion is pretty solid, and the Zelda remakes were great as well. A Link Between Worlds was awesome if you like 2D Zelda. ",2015-06-29 00:25:42+00:00,cslwc3k,1.0,t3_3bg66n,5243.0,ShouldIbuythisgame

507,"The difference can be slight at thinner gauges, but there is a definite measurable difference. Unfortunately very few brands publish the actual data on their string mass (D'addario and Kalium are the two that come to mind) but even those have noticeable differences. Caveat - as in my earlier post, I am talking about wound strings as opposed to plain steel strings. Plain strings do tend to be fairly consistent.

[Here's an example](http://puu.sh/iCONV/0fa2ca7c78.png) of what I'm talking about. The bottom 3 strings of a common 9-46 set. Given the same scale, tuning, and gauge, the Kalium strings (labelled as Nickel/Steel Hybrid) have a higher tension by 1.2 to 2 pounds, and the gap increases as you get thicker in gauge. That's the equivalent of tuning down a half step.

I'm not sure why you presume that anyone purchases these strings specifically to make bends easier - it's more often than not to allow guitarists to tune lower, maintaining the same tension, without having any tonal issues that can occur from thicker strings. I've never heard of a guitar player that ""could only accomplish certain bends on a certain brand of strings"" - however, I have heard of a lot of guitarists and bassists that prefer to buy, for instance, Kalium over any other brand because a thinner Kalium string will have the same tension as a thicker D'addario, for instance.",2015-06-26 01:08:14+00:00,csix4bn,4.0,t1_csismm5,8008.0,Guitar

517,"&gt; String guage can def fuck with a playing style.

Definitely, that's one of the reasons I gave up on 7-string guitars... in order to get the tension level I liked on a low B, I either had to use a really thick string (like a .064) or get a much longer scale length (26.5"" at minimum) and both detracted from how well my playing style worked. 

Agreed on the SEs, almost anything that comes out of that factory (World Music in Korea) plays fantastic for its price range (LTD Deluxe, most import Schecters, the new .strandberg* OS series) with the very odd exception of the Dean artist models.

518,"What Gibson actually produces doesn't change the fact that when people refer to ""Gibson scale"" they mean 24 3/4"". The fact that Gibson advertises the wrong scale is news to me, though, and just one more reason why I don't trust them as a company. [Here's some background on Gibson scale if you're interested](http://www.stewmac.com/How-To/Online_Resources/Fretting/Scale_Length_Explained.html). You are the best kind of right, though - technically right.

Rambly bullshit below.

However the difference between 24 3/4"" and 24 9/16"" is pretty narrow in practice - less than a quarter pound in tension difference on a .042 tuned to E (the low E of a 9 set Paul refers to). It's a little more pronounced on a PRS-scale (.28 or .49 pounds, depending on which Gibson scale you're looking at). For reference, that's 13.69, 13.9, 14.21, and 14.76 pounds for the two Gibson scales (9/16 then 3/4), PRS scale, and Fender scale respectively (D'addario wound .042 tuned to E2 for measurement).

Personally, I'd rather just buy a heavier string than entirely design a guitar with a specific scale length (and then a non-adjustable bridge for that scale length and those string gauges) to suit, but that's just me - and I do fully realize he had many, many other things he wanted to address with his guitar :P",2015-06-23 16:23:42+00:00,csg0zvn,5.0,t1_csfzkg7,2222.0,Guitar
