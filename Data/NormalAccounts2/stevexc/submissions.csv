#Introduction
The song spotlight is a recurring topic on this subreddit, where every week we will feature a different song included in the game or its DLC and discuss things like how to play its different riffs, techniques to focus on and more casual things like some interesting trivia or the artist's other work. Finally we'll conclude with a score attack challenge, a random entrant of which will be offered to choose the next song. 

The format will change depending on feedback and participation, so don't hesitate to send suggestions myself or the mods in general. 

#This Week: ""Take Me Out"" by Franz Ferdinand

Franz Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria, was born in 1875 and was assassinated in 1914, starting the first World War. Fun fact: the assassination was initially botched, until the assassin happened to be sitting in a cafe later that day when the Archduke passed in front of him, and the rest is history.

His name is shared with a Scottish rock band, formed in 2002, famous for their 2004 hit Take Me Out.

#""Take Me Out"" In-game

Take Me Out is a pretty straightforward song (hah aren't they all?). Lead is entirely single note riffs, and rhythm only has a few chordy sections that aren't too tough. Both tracks are pretty different from each other and are worth playing, though - it's moreso ""Guitar 1"" and ""Guitar 2"" than proper Lead and Rhythm. Bass isn't too out there either, but a bit funky. A couple 4-fret stretch hammerons to watch out for though.

#This Week: ""Double Vision"" by Foreigner
Double Vision is one of Foreigner's earlier singles, off of their second album, *Double Vision.* The name was inspired by a hockey game between the Flyers and the Sabres in which the goalie got taken out by one of Philly's bigger players and had to be removed from the game due to his double vision.

# ""Double Vision"" In-game

Double Vision isn't too intense of a track. It largely repeats 3 separate parts - the intro, verse, and chorus riffs. The chorus is where lead and rhythm really differ - lead plays some high arpeggios while rhythm holds it up with some chords. The bassline is fairly grooving, so no worries about getting too bored!

#This Week: ""My Best Friend's Girl"" by The Cars
The Cars are a Boston-based band that came from the new wave scene in the late 70s but blended a healthy amount of rock guitar into the synth-heavy genre, as well as their own unique artsy spin on music and aesthetics. They have a very unique sound, yet have always remained very marketable - selling over 23 million records in the US alone.

#This Week: ""Blood and Thunder"" by Mastodon

I've always been a huge fan of Mastodon, particularly this era of their stuff. They're a 4-piece grindcore/prog metal/hard rock band (depending on which album you pick up) from Atlanta and have made some solid face-pounding albums. The guitarists, Bill Kelliher and Brent Hinds, have some of the most unique blends of techniques I've seen in metal - lots of banjo rolling, chicken pickin', and other country techniques rolled in with the standard metal ones. Drummer Brann Dailor is (or was, he's dialed it back lately) probably one of the most fun drummers to listen to. And of course the bassist, Troy Sanders, holds is down solid for also being the primary vocalist (although nowadays most of the band shares vocal duties).

# ""Blood and Thunder"" In-game

Blood and Thunder is a pretty straight-forward song structurally. There's two main sections - the beginning half mostly alternates between the intro riff with its fast downpicking and sliding chords, and the crushing yet simple ""chorus"" riff. Section 2 is mostly a harmonized guitar line that eventually moves into a straightforward heavy chord progression, and finishes on the chorus.

# Theory Breakdown

###Background
So this song is pretty simple theory wise for the most part. We are clearly in some form of D, due to both the opening chords and the D pedaltone throughout, and since we are playing metal a minor key is pretty predictable. But the entire song is really just based on a playoff between the D and C chords, which are the I and vii notes. So keep that in mind as we go through this, cause everything comes back to the D &amp; C chords and their relationship.

###Intro
Pretty simple riff. Pedaltone the low D, switch between an D and a C sliding up to the E. The C resolves very nicely into the D since it is the b7. Eventually an F is thrown into the mix before the sliding turnaround lick. Now this D# actually is what starts to give away what our key actually is. We know we are probably in D. It is probably a minor key since there is a b7, but we also have an F, aka a b2. So if we look at our different Modes our only options are D phyrigian or D locrian. D Locrian contains the same notes as C Minor. So remember how I said it comes back to that C/D relationship, that is what makes the b2 work here in the verse riff.

###Chorus
The chorus is a bit weird. It is based on a Locrian Natural 6 scale. We have the b5 which is only really seen in a Locrian mode, BUT the 6 isn't flat like normal. So we are playing a Db here instead of the C played in the rest of the song. I think it just may be to slightly brighten up the chorus a bit, while still keeping the dissonance of the b5, but honestly I have no idea on the reason. Just can tell you Locrian Nat 6 is a Harmonic Minor based scale. 

###Interlude/Bridge/Solo
So the Rhythm guitar here alternates between an D and a C chord (who would have thunk). The lead guitars play an Dminor riff over the D chord, and then play a pretty much identicle riff in Cminor over the C chord. There is a second guitar that plays a harmonized riff, and that is just the exact same riff just shifted up a major fifth. I believe there is also a 3rd guitar that plays it down an octave as well.

#This Week: ""She Bangs The Drums"" by The Stone Roses

I'll be honest, I'm not super familiar with these guys. To borrow a phrase from some of our more sarcastic English members ""I guess they didn't make it across the pond"". Despite that, they were quite influential and are partially to thank/blame for Oasis.

# ""She Bangs The Drums"" In-game

This track is largely divided into three separate parts - a verse riff, a chorus riff, and a bridge/solo. None of the riffs are super super complicated, although they look overwhelming at first. Bass moves around a bit, but there's not a lot in the way of fills - once you've got the riffs down you can breeze through!

# Theory Breakdown

Intro  
Most of the song revolves around the E chord. Bass plays a cool E major lick, while the guitar plays around the E5 chord. That main riff is really just an E and B note repeated over and over. Toss in a C# for good measure. The C# is something you commonly see in blues riffs (as is this riff in general). A blues shuffle for example tends to shift between an E5 and E6 (E/B and E/C#).
A D chord is used next. Plays a similar riff to the E riff just a few more notes added to things. The D chord means two things for our key, either we are actually in E and the D is flat like we saw last week, or we are in A (the only difference between the two is the D vs D# anyway).  
Chorus  
Not too much to say. The chorus repeats a riff based around the A chord, bass plays an A and D over this. This does tell us our key though. It's an A!  
Solo  
We start off with an A/E chord progression, with the actual solo starting out with an A major pentatonic riff. Which then goes into this chord based riff which mostly is: D/A/D/G and moves into an alternating E/A and followed by an A based arpeggio riff before ending back at the D/A/D/G riff ending on an E.

#This Week: ""Just"" by Radiohead

Ah, back in the day when Radiohead was less indie and experimental and more rock. *Just* is off their second album, The Bends, known also (mainly) for the tracks *High and Dry* and *Fake Plastic Trees*. It's widely considered to be one of their best albums, and is often included on ""Best Albums of Who Cares"" type lists. 


# ""Just"" In-game

Get your index fingers ready, it's barre chord time! Also be prepared for a number of octave double stops and trem picking. Lead guitar has a lot of space to breathe in, but when it's game on it's game on. Rhythm is a bit more constant, and bass gets to groove quite a bit too.

#This Week: ""China Grove"" by The Doobie Brothers

The Doobie Brothers, named so despite not actually having any brothers in it (unless you use the, uh, 70s definition of ""brother"" then Tiran Porter counts for sure!), are a long-standing rock band, having toured and recorded nearly non-stop since the 70s aside from a brief break in the 80s.

# ""China Grove"" In-game

It's a relatively straight forward song on guitar. Both Lead and Rhythm are fairly similar, albeit not identical. Lots of bends in the solos, so watch your note tracking - you may have to bend further than feels ""right"". Other than that, watch out for the prechorus riff - it's quick! Bassists, for authenticity feel free to use a pick. The bassline itself is quite agile and has a good deal of movement, but it's quite playable with practice.


# Theory Breakdown

### Intro
To start things off, this song is in the key of E (bet you needed me for that one). The whole song revolves around the E power chord.

###Main Riff
Our chord progression for most of the song is E/D/C#/A (I/bVII/VI/IV). It's a descending lick that resolves back on the root. Nothing too special here. A flat 7th is used but, as we've seen over the last few weeks I've been doing this, that's not really out of the ordinary and is actually very common. The progression ends on the A which is the obvious note to return back to the E. The A is the IV for E and going to the opposite way, E is the V of A. These are considered the ""perfect"" intervals. They sound very nice and happy. If you look at the physics of it, the waves compliment eachother very well. Theres not distortion or clashing. So the A nicely resolves back into our root of E due to that relationship.

There are a few small licks throughout the verse but its all simple stuff in key. Nothing special going on. Most of them are ascending riffs which is kind of a cool juxtapose to the descending chords. But they are quick and you can barely hear them anyway.

###Prechorus
It's a pretty quick section. The guitar plays a C#m/B/E/B (vi/V/I/V). Pretty straight forward. Ends with a nice chromatic run from the A to the C. Notice how the C kind of hangs there and sounds somewhat off/melancholy. It's in E minor but not E major. In standard classic rock style, this song blends minor and major quite a bit (yay power chords). You'll see more of this come the solo.

###Chorus
Pretty much the same as the verse, just more licks. The main one is just E/F#/G#. Nice little chromatic run. You can hear it just singing it (do/re/mi).

###Solo
As far as the phrasing goes in this solo, there is not really very much I was able to gleam from it. The first half of the solo is played in E major pentatonic. A lot of emphasis is put on the E and the A (which is removed from the pentatonic scale) is teased a lot through bends from the F# (G string 11th fret). Going into the second half of the solo, a quick E arpeggio is played before moving into the E minor pentatonic scale. A lot of emphasis is put on the G during this section (the iii) and the D (the vii). There's another E major arpeggio before going into the closing riff.

#This Week: ""Supersonic"" by Oasis

Supersonic is the debut single from britpop band Oasis, better known as the band responsible for bringing Wonderwall to college campuses everywhere. Originally thought to be about a prostitute, it was later revealed that the song is about the sound engineer's nine-stone (126 pound!) rottweiler with terrible gas.

#This Week: ""Snarling of Beasts"" by Bedowyn
Bedowyn is one of those bands that made it in due to a connection to Rocksmith itself - drummer Marc is an environment artist for Red Storm, and worked on the game. They're one of the unlockable tracks - if you don't have it, play missions until you do! It's a cool track for sure. They're a 4-piece heavy/doom metal band from Raleigh, very much in the style of fellow Rocksmith artists Red Fang and Mastodon, to name a few. This track is off of their first [s]full-length, 2015's Blood of the Fall[/s] EP, 2013's Wolves &amp; Trees.

# ""Snarling of Beasts"" In-game

Snarling of Beasts is, simply put, one long crescendo. It's a constant build to a very bluesy yet heavy solo at the end, featuring a very similar chord progression that gets consistently built upon. The vast majority of the song is doublestops on the A and D (technically, G and C) strings amidst a pedal tone on the open E (tuned to a D - the track is in full step down D Standard tuning). Bass mirrors the guitar for the most part. 

As usual for tracks with an alternate arrangement (alt. rhythm in this case) we will only be taking submissions for the 3 primary arrangements - Lead, Rhythm, and Bass.

#This Week: ""Boys Don't Cry"" by The Cure

The Cure, the original goth band, despite their music ranging all over from pop to punk to new wave. They're quite an influential and interesting band, and frontman Robert Smith is quite a unique dude. 

Boys Don't Cry is arguably one of their bigger tracks (not quite their biggest, which would likely be Friday I'm In Love), and is about society's pressure on men to ""act like men"".

# ""Boys Don't Cry"" In-game
This is an on disc track from the original game - we'll accept Song Results screenshots from either game, of course, but only for lead/rhythm/bass tracks (not the Combo track).

Lead is pretty straightforward - there's the lead melody on the B and e strings and barre chords during the verses. The bridge is also barre chords, but if you've got the verse down you're fine. Rhythm is the barre chords throughout. Bass is fairly active - you jump around on the A string a lot, and a good portion is in the higher register. All in all, not a super tough song.

#Introduction
The song spotlight is a recurring topic on this subreddit, where every week we will feature a different song included in the game or its DLC and discuss things like how to play its different riffs, techniques to focus on and more casual things like some interesting trivia or the artist's other work. Finally we'll conclude with a score attack challenge, a random entrant of which will be offered to choose the next song.

Ah, The Black Keys. Artist of choice for beginner Rocksmithers. Not much more I can say that hasn't already been said - I think aside from Muse, they might be the most featured band for Song Spotlights!

This one's a bit tougher than some of their other tracks, but shouldn't pose too much of a challenge! Bassists, do what you do best - go take a nap. No arrangement for you.

#This Week: ""Rondo Alla Turca"" by Mozart

Mozart is apparently some jazz guitarist that nobody's ever heard of. Go figure, right?
Okay I'll stop screwing around. Summer before last the Rocksmith team put together a pack called Bachsmith which had more ""modern"" (relatively) imaginings of a number of very famous classical pieces, each with their own schtick. For Rondo alla Turca they chose a jazz feel and it slays.

# ""Rondo Alla Turca""

Good luck. Use Riff Repeater, this track isn't super super insane, but it's quick. Slow it down and learn the phrases then speed them up as you get comfortable with them. Bass players, don't think you get off easy. There's a decent solo in here for you, too!

#This Week: ""Chompers"" by Fang Island
Fang Island is a indie prog whatever rock band that started off as an art project. They haven't done a whole lot, releasing 2 albums since 2010, but their debut hit the top 30 in the US Heatseekers list on release. The name comes from an Onion article which listed Donald Rumsfeld's secret hideaway as being located on Fang Island.

# ""Chompers"" In-game
I did not realize how fun this track is. It's very lead-oriented - a good half of it is tapping. Rhythm is pretty straight forward, largely power chords. Bass is chugging away on roots. Since there are a few different techniques used in this track, I'll let people ask for help for the parts they're having issue on.

#This Week: ""Every Breath You Take"" by The Police
The Police are a very classic British rock band, commonly known for bringing us the multitalented bassist/vocalist (and actor!) Sting - although we can't ignore the equally talented although much more often overlooked Stewart Copeland and Andy Summers. Amazingly these guys are amongst the top-selling musicians of all time, yet have only put out 5 studio albums. They've sold 75 million records - only 5 million fewer than, uh... Coldplay.

Every Breath You Take, most often heard in the context as a love song despite being a a sinister threat from a stalker, is their biggest hit, the biggest-selling song of the year it was released ('83), and the fifth-biggest-selling song of the 80s. So it's a pretty decent idea to learn it, because EVERYBODY will recognize it.

I wanna see as many scores as possible, though, as this is an E-Standard On-Disc track!

# ""Every Breath You Take"" In-game

Lead guitar is almost entirely the trademark arpeggio riff through the whole song. It can get a little tough, and you'll need to use your pinky to stretch to hit the 9th for each chord - luckily it's palm-muted, so you can jump around a little. I recommend using your index for both the root and 3rd of each chord (that would be the C# on the 6th fret of the G for the first chord, and the A on the 2nd fret of the second chord), your middle for the 5th, and your pinky for that 9th. Keep your eyes open on the Dadd9 and Eadd9 chords as the picking pattern does change here and there. The other two sections are pretty straight forward, a couple barre chords and a bit of a simple melody, mostly following the vocals. There's also a brief portion where you mimic the piano line, but it's also very simple.

Rhythm is the same as lead, although instead of the melody parts you play a couple additional arpeggios, same deal there.

Bass is largely a steady 8th note pulse on the root notes, with the odd fill here and there. It's solid but not super flashy.

By and large this song is largely endurance for all tracks!

#This Week: ""Brand New Kind of Blue"" by Gold Motel
Gold Motel is, I think, an interesting choice for Rocksmith 2014. They're a relatively small indie-rock/pop band from Chicago, and actually appear to be defunct since before RS2014 came out as the singer, Greta Morgan, has returned to her primary band, The Hush Sound (a somewhat larger indie-pop/rock band) and they haven't put anything out since the album featuring Brand New Kind of Blue. Honestly, I don't have much else to say about these guys!

# ""Brand New Kind of Blue"" In-game
Overall guitarists won't have too tough a time with this. Lead is primarily a fairly simple melody on the D G and B strings, which is played alternatingly as individual notes and double-stops. The chorus is mostly barre chords which may give some a bit of trouble. Rhythm is mostly barre chords the whole way through, both strummed and arpeggiated. Bass holds down the chords and is also straight-forward but works quite well for the song.

#Introduction
The song spotlight is a recurring topic on this subreddit, where every week we will feature a different song included in the game or its DLC and discuss things like how to play its different riffs, techniques to focus on and more casual things like some interesting trivia or the artist's other work. Finally we'll conclude with a score attack challenge, a random entrant of which will be offered to choose the next song. 

The format will change depending on feedback and participation, so don't hesitate to send suggestions myself or the mods in general. 

#This Week: ""The Kids Aren't Alright"" by The Offspring
The Offspring is widely considered to be one of the best-selling punk rock bands of all time, having sold 40 million+ records over their 30 year career. 9 million of those records were copies of their fifth album, Americana, which is where this week's song comes from, as well as their other two biggest hits, ""Pretty Fly (For A White Guy)"" and ""Why Don't You Get A Job?"". Obligatory fun fact: Lead singer Dexter Holland is a doctoral student studying molecular biology, and has published a paper on the topic of microRNA in HIV genomes.

# ""The Kids Aren't Alright"" In-game
At its core (and its other levels for that matter), ""The Kids Aren't Alright"" is a pretty standard poppy punk song. Intro, pre-verse, verse, chorus, pre-verse, verse, chorus, solo, solo over chorus, end. Both guitars play the same palm-muted power chord progression through the verses, which will need steady downpicking to sound ""right"". Chorus is unmuted power chords that can be strummed, and rhythm guitar continues playing them under lead's ""pre-verse"" riff. Rhythm plays the same progression under the solo as well, albeit with long sustained chords. Intro for lead guitar may take a bit of work - I'd recommend watching [Riff Repeater's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwDZWycIyPw) video for an idea of the positions to use. The solo shouldn't be too tough but may take a few repeats. Bass is very straightforward, it's derived from the rhythm guitar part. You may want to use a pick as the verses are fairly fast straight 8th notes - blister city if you're not used to fingerpicking that steadily!

#This Week: ""Ocean Avenue"" by Yellowcard
Break out the  hair dye and ear gauges, we're going pop punk this week! Yellowcard's a Floridian pop punk/alt rock band and have been around since the late 90s. However, Ocean Avenue is by and far their biggest album (and single) and despite putting out 5 more albums since then (plus 2 acoustic albums!) they've largely faded from the mainstream. That said, they did manage to break the pop-punk formula by including a quite unconventional instrument (for the genre, at least) - electric violin. You'll notice this chiefly in the chorus of this week's track, and you'll get to play the violin part in the outro.

# ""Ocean Avenue"" In-game
Rhythm guitar is pretty straight-forward this week, lots of power chords. Some heavy palm muting during the verse - if you're using light strings you may want to back off on the mutes a little so you're not knocking the chords sharp. It's only in Drop D so you should be okay with the vast majority of strings (although you 9-42 lovers may wanna use a light touch!). Lead's got a little more going on - in the verse there's a lick with some slides. Be conscious of where you end the slides, as it's very easy to slide too far (or not far enough). The end lick may take some practice as well. Bass players, you've got a fairly easy ride this week as well. Nothing to complex, but still a solid part with some fills.

#This Week: ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"" by Hank Williams
Hank Williams is an absolute legend. Easily one of if not the most influential American singer/songwriter ever, he influenced every genre from country to rock to blues in one way or another despite having a very short life - he passed away from heart failure at 29. His legacy has been carried on by his son, Hank Williams Jr,  who plays country and Southern rock, and grandson Hank Williams III, who's blended his familial country styles with punk rock and metal, between his band Assjack and ex-Pantera frontman Phil Anselmo's band, Superjoint Ritual, which he played bass for. I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry was famously described by Elvis Presley as the saddest song he's ever heard, and is widely considered a classic influential track.

# ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"" In-game
This track is pretty straightforward. Rhythm guitar is simple chords on the beat, and bass is quite subdued. Lead guitar's a little more complex and meandering, but not quite shreddy... keep in mind that since it's played clean, you'll have to keep your technique clean as well!

#This Week: ""Escape (The Pina Colada Song)"" by Rupert Holmes
This is a lovely song about how if you're having relationship troubles... cheat! Chances are she's having troubles too and you'll wind up back with each other! Because screw communication, right? ;) The song is interesting because the lyrics were written as ""dummy lyrics"" for another song, the inclusion of ""pina colada"" was ad libbed (the line originally referred to Humphrey Bogart), and from two drummers they were only able to get an intro, an outro, and 16 bars of the song which had to get looped.

# ""Escape"" In-game
Bass players, you get to chill this week - it's a short repeating phrase throughout the whole song. Just feel it, maaaaaaan.

Guitarists have a little more movement but nothing too out there - I think the big thing will be getting your slides smooth and purposeful!

#This Week: ""Ain’t No Love In The Heart Of The City"" by Bobby ""Blue"" Bland
While many have originally heard this as a Whitesnake track (or I suppose these days, sampled by Jay Z), it was originally an R&amp;B track recorded by the Lion of Blues, Bobby Bland, 4 years earlier. While maybe not as widely known as BB King, Blues is a hugely respected blues singer, with a career spanning over 60 years, from his first single in '52 to his death in 2013, which he kept performing up until.

# ""Ain’t No Love In The Heart Of The City"" In-game
In true blues fashion, Ain't No Love is a relatively straightforward song. There's essentially two separate parts for the lead part - some lightly strummed barre chords (interjected with the riff) for the chorus, and a bit of a lead part for the verse. A few of the choruses are replaced with a modification of the riff over the chord progression. Rhythm guitar plays close to the same over the verse, but for the chorus it's all higher register chords. Bass is a fairly dynamic line, as per R&amp;B tradition. Use your oldest, thumpiest strings, and listen for the groove!

#This Week: ""Time Bomb"" by Rancid
Rancid is one of the key bands that really brought punk back to the forefront in the US in the early 90s, alongside Green Day and the Offspring (both of whom once played punk, wouldja believe it!). Fortunately for us they abandoned a lot of the over-simplicity that the Sex Pistols and the Ramones exemplified, as everyone in Rancid can more than hold their own on their instruments. Bassist Matt Freeman, at very least, is commonly mentioned when talking about punks that can play their asses off. Time Bomb is off their 3rd album ""...And Out Come The Wolves"" which is widely considered a must-listen in the punk and ska worlds.

# ""Time Bomb"" In-game
Time Bomb follows a lot of the Ska aesthetics. The guitar part is upstroked chords aside from the solo, and the bass is for the most part a walking line. Neither are super difficult, but offer a bit more to do than some tracks. I'd say it's a solid track for bass players transitioning from beginner to intermediate.

Guitarists: While it's not expressly notated as such, what I've found is the easiest way to play parts like this is continuously strum 8th note chords, but mute the downstrokes - that way the chord only sounds on the upbeat, but you have a defined rhythm to keep yourself in. It's very easy to push the beat and wind up playing on the downbeat instead of the upbeat otherwise.

#Introduction
The song spotlight is a recurring topic on this subreddit, where every week we will feature a different song included in the game or its DLC and discuss things like how to play its different riffs, techniques to focus on and more casual things like some interesting trivia or the artist's other work. Finally we'll conclude with a score attack challenge, a random entrant of which will be offered to choose the next song. 

The format will change depending on feedback and participation, so don't hesitate to send suggestions myself or the mods in general. 

#This Week: ""25 or 6 to 4"" by Chicago
Chicago is arguably one of the most succesful rock bands of all time, with 23 studio albums released since 1969 (including 8 multi-platinum records) and 21 top-10 singles. 25 or 6 to 4 wasn't one of those singles, but it was their first single to crack to Top 5.

# ""Good Enough"" In-game
The rhythm track for 25 or 6 to 4 is pretty straightforward - the majority of the song is that classic descending chord riff. The biggest challenge will be maintaining a solid groove for the full five minutes - I'd argue this is rhythm guitar at its purest. Lead gets going a bit more - I'd estimate over half the song sees the lead guitar soloing. It's mostly minor pentatonic unless my ear fails me, so it's nothing too far out there, but it'll take some practice. Bass players, you don't have the EASIEST ride, but it's not a crazy challenge or anything. Just get into the groove!

#This Week: ""Where Is My Mind?"" by Pixies
Unquestionably their most well-known song, Where Is My Mind? was featured prominently in Fight Club, as well as in countless other movies, TV shows, commercials, etc.

The Pixies themselves are a quintessential alt-rock band, despite the fact that they broke up in '93. They reunited in 2004 but have only put out one album (and a single) since. Despite that they were major influences on almost every alt rock band of the 90s, most notably Nirvana (who admitted that Smells Like Teen Spirit was their attempt at a Pixies rip off), Radiohead, Weezer, Bush, and Pavement.

One thing that really impressed me while checking out their biography is that in their almost 30-year-long career (closer to 20 if you don't count their hiatus) they've only had one lineup change, which was Paz Lenchantin (best known as the bassist for A Perfect Circle, but with a very varied resume) replacing Kim Deal, their original bassist, last year.

# ""Where Is My Mind?"" In-game
Heads up: this track is from the original Rocksmith - we'll definitely take screenshots from the original game if you don't have the conversion pack. I haven't played this for years, and never in-game, so I'll get back to you on some more specific tips!

#This Week: ""Sore Tummy"" by PAWS
PAWS are a relatively small alt rock band from Scotland. Honestly I'm not finding a lot of info out there on these guys - they've only been around for a few years now, and only have two albums out. The few tracks I've checked out from their newest have a much grungier edge than the track included in Rocksmith, which has very ""indie rock"" leanings. It seems to be quite well-reviewed, for those of you who are into this kind of stuff!

Sore Tummy features vocals from Alice Costelloe of Big Deal, a London-and-California blend pop rock band - she gives this track a very Silversun Pickups ""Lazy Eye"" vibe.


# ""Sore Tummy"" In-game
Just a heads up - even if you're not into this style of music (I know I'm not in the slightest) give this track a shot. It's a stock track in RS2014, in E Standard, and not very long, and it's actually a lot of fun to play. It's not too hard as well - all the transitions feel very natural, it's not technically demanding... it's just overall a simple, fun song. The bassline is actually pretty fun too - there's a bit of a bass lead break in the bridge.

#This Week: ""I Appear Missing"" by Queens of the Stone Age
Queens of the Stone Age was born out of the ashes of the essential stoner rock band Kyuss after they broke up (sadly) in the mid-90s. Guitarist Josh Homme decided to start his own band with its own sound, despite one of the early lineups being entirely comprised of ex-Kyuss members. Throughout the years they've had a revolving door of musicians, with Josh Homme being the only constant (although guitarist Troy van Leeuwen has managed to stay on board for the last 4 records). ""I Appear Missing"" is off the most recent record, ""...Like Clockwork"".

# ""I Appear Missing"" In-game
This section may be rife with errors as I don't have this track :P. ""I Appear Missing"" is tuned to E Standard. For the most part, the lead part is arpeggiated chords, in between a few bluesy lead licks. The ending will be the toughest part, with some energetic soloing and a fairly stretchy pull-off riff. Bass players get to jump around the neck a fair bit, but there's not a lot of super challenging parts - the outro is a bit quick, but builds on the same bassline as the rest of the song. Shouldn't be too bad with some practice. A pick may be best suited for this track.

#This Week: ""Juicebox"" by The Strokes
The Strokes are a New York-based garage rock band who've been around since the late 90s (though their first album didn't drop until '01). They've got a fairly unique sound, but it also has a lot of similarities to a number of garage rock revival bands like The Hives, The White Stripes, and The Vines. It's very poppy, but with a lot punk edge and subversiveness. Juicebox is the first single off their 3rd (of 5) albums, and also their highest charting one to date. It should be familiar to Americans and Europeans alike, as the band has achieved quite a bit of success on both sides of the pond (this album hit #4 on the Billboard Top 200 and #1 on the UK Albums charts, and did quite well throughout a lot of the rest of Europe).

# ""Love Spreads"" In-game
This track is in good ol' E Standard tuning. The track starts off with a very Peter Gunn-esque chuggy (well, for pop) riff before the more energetic power chords come in on top. The chorus is some pretty simple double stops and chords over the bassline, which one guitar track (Lead? I'm going off youtube vids here) and the bass are playing together. The solo isn't too tough, but it's fairly quick - no complicated techniques, though.

Bass players, just lay into the groove!

#This Week: ""Plug in Baby"" by Muse
Muse is some kind of British punk band, I guess? Dunno, never heard of them, guess they never made it across the pond... ;)

But seriously, I wouldn't be surprised to hear that they're one of the most popular bands in the game. We pretty much triple our submissions every time we do a Muse track, so it's kind of a shame we're running out!

# ""Plug in Baby"" In-game
The track is fairly straightforward. The intro/pre-verse riff is the most complicated part of the song, but isn't oo out there - it's all within one position, so no awkward jumping around. The chorus itself is barre chords, so there's an opportunity to work on those.

The bass part isn't too bad either. You're arpeggiating through power-chord shapes during the pre-verse and riff, and playing roots (more-or-less) during the chorus. It's a bit more active than some basslines, but not blow-your-mind hard.

Finally we'll conclude with a score attack challenge, a random entrant of which will be offered to choose the next song. 

The format will change depending on feedback and participation, so don't hesitate to send suggestions myself or the mods in general. 

#This Week: ""YYZ"" by Rush
One of the quintessential prog songs, YYZ is arguably one of Rush's most famous tracks (or at least, one of their most famous riffs). They've played it at basically every show they've put on for the past 34 years. Like Danny DeVito, it's fairly short (well, for a prog song) yet fairly complicated. The intro is in 10/8 time, and is actually morse code for the title, or more specifically the airport ID code for Toronto Pearson airport. The higher (and longer) notes are the dashes, and the lower (and shorter) notes are the dots: -.-- -.-- --.. The track is an instrumental because even Geddy Lee couldn't play it while singing. That's totally a fact and I didn't just make it up.

# ""YYZ"" In-game
Hooooo boy, this one is a tough track. Let's start with guitar. Honestly the guitar part is relatively straightforward. There's 5 different sections to the song - the trademark intro (including the transitional fill), the fast main riff, the melodic lead line, the chord part, and the solos. The intro isn't too bad for either instrument, so long as you can internalize that rhythm. Visualising it as the morse code may help. I count it as ""ONE and ONE TWO THREE and ONE TWO THREE FOUR and uh"". The fill isn't too hard, just quick. Proper finger placement will help a lot - for both bass and guitar, lead with your index finger. You'll have to pivot and reach back a fret for the next string with your index, but the rest will stay more-or-less in the pattern.

The next riff for guitarists involves ""economy picking"". Economy picking is basically alternate picking, but allowing for connected movements - in this case, you would down-stroke the first note (7 on the D) and up-stroke the next (another 7 on the D), but instead of carrying on the ""up-down-up-down"" pattern you'd continue the motion of that upstroke to the next string to play the 9 on the A. And so on and so forth. It's not complex to think through - default to alternating the motion, but if it's more economical to continue the direction you're going in, do that. If you want a hint, the first bar of this riff would be DUUDUDUU. Once you get into the swing of it, it feels very natural, and helps keep fast picked parts sounding precise. Bass players can do something similar - instead of just alternating between index and middle fingers, sometimes it's more economical to drag the finger you just played with to the next string.

The melodic riff isn't too tough for guitar, just make sure you don't ignore the slides that Rocksmith directs you to make. They're essential for the necessary position shifts to play the riff. Use your damn pinky, too! Protip - for the bend, bend PAST the point where it SOUNDS right. It's probably not, and Rocksmith will probably consider it wrong anyways. Your ear is good at ""tricking"" you into hearing a note that's not quite there, Rocksmith doesn't give a shit. Bassists - have fun. The fills in this riff are hellish, and there's really not much to say other than use all 4 fingers to their most efficient. Practice it slowly and work your way up.

The bass part under the chord riff doesn't change much from the previous part, so... screw you, I guess ;) (Remember kids, this is coming from a bassist!). Guitar gets to relax a bit, though. I'd recommend making the entire barre chord shape for these chords (they're both your standard major barre shape - the same you'd play for your ""open"" F chord) to make the second part, with the 3 individual notes after the chord, a little easier - play the top portion of the chord twice, then life your pinky from the D string to play those three ascending notes.

For the solo - as always, hop into Riff Repeater (even though I KNOW you've been doing this all along!), crank the difficulty up to 100, and then drop the speed down to as slow as you need to be able to hit every single note. Remember, the general philosophy is if you can't play it slowly, you can't play it at full speed. Period. I've got no specific tips for the solo itself - it's a tough one. Bass is playing a similar part to what was played previously.

Overall, keep in mind that this is not an easy song - if you're at the beginner level, you may not necessarily be able to play through it on Hard by the end of the week! Don't get discouraged though, we not only accept but encourage you to submit scores for whatever difficulty you can play - the spirit of these challenges isn't to see who's best, but rather to get people playing new songs!

#This Week: ""Sir Duke"" by Stevie Wonder
Another classic track from a classic artist. Sir Duke is Stevie Wonder's tribute to the immortal Duke Ellington, a massively influential and important jazz bandleader and pianist.

# ""Sir Duke"" In-game
Sir Duke's gonna be a little different from most tracks in the game. Like most songs from that era, particularly the Motown style stuff, it's much less riff based than your typical rock song. As such, for the most part the guitar is sitting back as a rhythm instrument. For the majority of the song you'll be holding your barre chords and arpeggiating through them. Slow the song down and get the chord changes down pat and it should be easy pickin'.

Bassists... start stretching. You've got a walking bassline ahead of you. Fortunately, it's a simpler one - for the most part, you're just playing Root-Fifth-Octave (the typical power chord shape) with passing tones in between the chords. Don't be afraid to use your pinky!

As far as the signature riff, you're on your own - it's not super technically demanding, so just slow it down until you're comfortable with it.

#This Week: ""Spoonman"" by Soundgarden
If you ask someone what band exemplifies ""grunge"" to them... they'll probably say Nirvana. But Soundgarden is arguably just as good an answer, and one I would definitely prefer (despite being more of a Pearl Jam/Alice In Chains kinda guy... BUT I DIGRESS). Badmotorfinger is an absolute classic album, and Superunknown - which contained, amongst other tracks, Spoonman - was a worthy successor. 

# ""Spoonman"" In-game

One thing you'll quickly notice about Spoonman is it's in Drop D. Soundgarden, while not the first to use it, was a huge proponent of various non-standard tunings, and it could be argued that they were fairly key in popularizing it.

The second thing you'll notice is the time signature. It's in 7/4... mostly. With occasional 4/4 break. It's very much a groove that you have to feel. The general pulse of the song is what's called septuple-meter - 7 beats, broken up as such: One-two One-two One-two-three. 

Technically speaking, it's not a difficult song, so just get locked in with that groove and feel it!

While we do arrange the scores from high to low, this isn't a competition. The ""winner"" is selected at random from all the entrants. So no matter how well or poorly you think you do, it's always worth it to send a score! The goal of these spotlights is to get people trying new songs and learning new things - in my experience as a bass and guitar teacher, one of the most effective ways to get better in general is to try to learn new things. You never know what exactly it is you'll try to play that will finally get you off that plateau! We've got over 12 thousand members, I'd love to see more people giving it shot! It doesn't matter if you suck, nobody'll judge!

#This Week: ""Limelight"" by Rush 
Limelight, from their 1980 album Moving Pictures, is arguably one of Rush's more straight-forward songs, and also one of their live staples. It's got a solid groove, and Alex Lifeson's favorite solo. I'm just gonna cut and paste this little snippet from an interview with Alex that sums up the song and his solo:

""It's funny: after all these years, the solo to ""Limelight"" is my favorite to play live. There's something very sad and lonely about it; it exists in its own little world. And I think, in its own way, it reflects the nature of the song's lyrics - feeling isolated amidst chaos and adulation.""

I'll also mention that if anyone wants to get into Rush, this album is a fantastic place to start. Not hugely proggy compared to some of their stuff, and some fantastic well-known tracks.

# ""Limelight"" In-game
As I mentioned, Limelight is a pretty straight-forward song. Not a lot of complicated time signatures or shredding. Probably the hardest part on the guitar track is going to be all the barre chords. The solo itself is more fluid than most, but is definitely a rough approximation of what Lifeson actually plays - in reality, it's a very whammy-oriented solo for the first half.

The bass line (like most Rush basslines) is *stupid* fun to play. Like, fun enough that I'll probably make time to do an entry this week. It's largely all within the same position - bassists moreso than guitarists need (and this is a general rule) to remember to use one finger per fret as often as possible. The song is largely played in 2nd pos, so keeping your thumb anchored in the middle of the neck directly between 3rd and 4th frets will give you a perfect pivot point to hit 99% of the notes. Remember kids, on bass the name of the game is economy of motion :P

#This Week: ""Dream On"" by Aerosmith
Dream On is the track that first catapulted the Bad Boys from Boston up intoi superstar-dom. It's the first single off their first s/t album, and (judging from my experience trying to find it on Napster as a kid) their most consistently mislabeled and misattributed song (Sing For The Moment by Led Zeppelin? pfft).

#""Dream On"" In-game
The song isn't extremely challenging, but a lot of fun. Keep in mind that it's tuned just slightly sharp - although the small amount you'll have to adjust won't add more than 5-6 seconds The main guitar part is some descending chords on the treble strings - the easiest way to play this is to hold each of the chord shapes for the entire bar, whether you're playing the ""bass"" note or the two higher ones. The small lick in the intro is primarily on the B string and is just up and down the minor scale. Keep an eye out for the pattern - you walk three notes up the scale, take two steps back, walk another three up, and so on before trilling your way back down. Other thank that, there's not a LOT to the song. It's based off the same chord progression the whole way through so it should start feeling pretty familiar, and the lead licks are all pretty bluesy and bendy rather than fast shred parts and should come with some practice. Remember to overbend if the game isn't recognizing them, as it's very common it to sound like you're hitting a note when you're actually a few cents short.
