Obviously fabric is part of the construction, but if you're not leaving it out in the elements, it is a great basket. I take my to work, camping, etc. That said, it catches some it shouldn't and spits out some it shouldn't, but it's the practice that is important to me.

Anyway, phosphorus (second number on the fertilizer bag) is more important than nitrogen for germinating seedlings. I'd recommend putting it down sooner than later.

Photosynthetic efficiency is reduced as a result.  The ratio between atmospheric O2 and CO2 concentrations is decreased if CO2 is increased, which is why plants grow better with more CO2/less O2.  This phenomena is limited to C3 plants, as C4 plants have evolved to reduce photorespiration.  Now, the rising CO2 is only beneficial if temperatures do not increase, as high temperatures reduce the solubility of CO2 as well as diminish the ability of Rubisco to differentiate between CO2 and O2.",2016-02-05 15:19:26+00:00,czov9rr,3.0,t1_czouaas,1683.0,science

Everybody agreed, so the trades were processed.  I didn't realize until today that in ""pushing the trades through"" the commish changed trade review from ""league votes"" to ""commissioner.""  I think this is important for two reasons: 1) if he knew to change that setting, he damn well should have known you can't cancel trades after accepting them and 2) he was a part of those first trades while it was set under league votes, so he wouldn't have seen a cancel trade button in that instance.
