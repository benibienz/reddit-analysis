I'm in the process of deciding between the AX15 and the B15 for my next disc golf bag.  The prices are basically the same if you purchase the rain cover for the B15, as the AX15 comes with one.  However, the nearest retailer is over 3 hours away, so I have to make a decision without seeing them myself.  Thus, I was hoping somebody here had experience with both.  My biggest fear is that the AX15 will be too big.  I currently bag 12 discs, so I don't foresee needing room for 25 (but I'm sure many of you have said the same thing and been wrong).  Can anyone help me out with a solid comparison here?  Thanks.

This is the first season for at least four of the eight managers.  This is the league commissioner's third season on Yahoo and first as commissioner.  The commissioner offered two trades on Tuesday and said that the first person to accept the trade would get it.  They offered Maclin for Gurley to one team and Cobb for Forte to another.  Both teams accepted simultaneously.  The commissioner went on to say that they needed to think about which one to accept, as they just now loaded themselves with RBs.  However, these weren't verbal deals, these were legitimate trade offers and acceptances.  Commissioner goes on to play dumb and said that they didn't know you couldn't cancel an accepted trade.  Both trades were vetoed (via league majority vote) solely because it was an ""honest mistake"" made by the commissioner and not because they were unfair trades.  The commissioner is a friend of mine, and I'm inclined to believe that they lied to get out of the trades.  Thus, I'd like to know what it looks like on a Yahoo commissioner's end when a trade is accepted.  Would it be possible for a commissioner to believe that all league members have the ability to cancel/veto a trade?  Or, is it obvious that vetoing a trade is a commissioner tool?  Screenshots would be especially helpful for me.  For me, this has become larger than fantasy football, as I see this as a friend lying to me (and the rest of the league) to benefit their fantasy team.

* Innova Beast

* Innova TeeBird

* Discraft Cyclone (similar to an Innova Leopard I'm told)

* Innova Mako3

* Innova Aviar


This bag suits my skills very well at the moment.  However, I'd like an additional disc so that when my (beginner) girlfriend plays with me, loaning her my Cyclone won't leave a void for me.  Basically, what's a disc that won't double up on something I already have yet might be easy enough for my girlfriend to throw?  Would an Eagle fall too close to my TeeBird (GF had success throwing one previously)?  I also considered some midrange discs, but I love my Mako3 too much and don't know if I would benefit from another midrange.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.  I know this dual-use is asking a lot.  Thanks!
