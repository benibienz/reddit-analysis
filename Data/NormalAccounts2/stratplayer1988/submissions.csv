I'm gonna be applying a Retrobrite (or Retr0brite) solution to an old Commodore Vic-20 computer in order to reverse the yellowing. I still haven't purchased my UV light to start the process. Has anyone ever used an UV led strip when applying Retrobrite to a yellowed plastic object? If so, what were the results of your applications?

Originally, the tanks was a nearly-complete kit from Petsmart. Since January of 2016, I kept about 10 fancy guppies (all male) and no live plants. Don't worry, I slowly added them and I did so after the nitrogen cycle was completed. Unfortunately, I ran into some issues with my hang-on filter that resulted in all of my fish dying. I did everything a responsible tank owner should do regarding maintenance: 30% water changes weekly; not overfeeding; check the water quality on a weekly basis; and change the carbon filter cartridge every month. Yet, they kept dying. More specifically, they often died within a few days of me replacing the filter cartridge. I also noticed that whenever I replaced the filter, the ammonia levels would go up to 0.25 ppm, but then about go down to about 0 after a week or so. 

After giving my most recent parameters (PPM) of PH 7.2, Ammonia 0.25, and nitrites and nitrates of 0, the guys at my local fish store said that I could be having issues with beneficial bacteria dying with the new carbon filter cartridge being installed. They suggested that I either get a cannister filter or build a wet/dry sump to take care of the problem of a lack of bacteria present. 

Presently, I am working a wet/dry sump design using a 10 gallon tank and four of these Sterilite stackable drawers (http://www.sterilite.com/SelectProduct.html?id=692&amp;ProductCategory=260&amp;section=1). The top drawer will hold the filter floss, the two middle drawers will hold plastic pot scrubbies, and the bottom drawer will be empty to accommodate the water. I will also place the return pump and heater in this sump. I'm still running tests to get the flow levels correct and ensure that the tank won't overflow and/or run dry. By the time I get the levels correct, I'm gonna have to restart the nitrogen cycle in my tank. 

Is this a good way to set up my new filter or do any of you recommend that a different filtration setup? Should I put carbon or biomax in one of the drawers? If you need me to provide more details that I may have left out, please let me know, and I'll be more than happy to provide the other details.

My birthday is coming up soon, and I want to make my first gun purchase. The only gun I've ever owned is a Charles Daly over and under 12 gauge shotgun (made in Japan). I don't know whether or not I should buy a handgun (I would go with a Glock 19) or an assault rifle-type gun. What your recommendations be on my first handgun choice? In addition, if I buy a rifle, should I get an AK variant or an AR-15? Be sure to provide your reasons for the questions I am asking. Thanks!

Nick

P.S. If I'll get a rifle, I'll try out both guns at a range just see which I like best.

However, I don't want to simply take a perfectly functional system (or even one that can be repaired) and just use what I need to make it. I don't believe in cannibalize video game consoles (especially ones like the Neo Geo) for some Etsy project since there are those (including myself) who want to add them to their video game collection. Is there a place where I can get either an AES console that cannot be repaired or even a reproduction shell? I checked eBay and there are none available. The Neo Geo X will do as well.

Within the past couple of months, I recently moved back into my parents house to save some scratch while I worked on my Master's degree in accounting. For this, I am eternally grateful to them for letting me do this, and to let them know how much I appreciate their generosity, I try to make myself useful around their home. For instance, if my mom or dad needs me to help them pick up a large item that requires two or more cars to transport, I am there for them. I also spent quite some time trying to install a snowplow on their new riding lawn mower and even used it to clear the snow. Yet, no one except for my dad seems to care what I have done.
To add insult to injury, my sister keeps screwing up and gets all this undeserved attention. For instance, she once backed my car into a cement rail, and then got a new car later that week. There was also a time when she asked me to write two of her class papers. My dad made her pay me $25 per page, which totaled up to $450 for my services. After I got the papers done and submitted, she got A on both; yet she never paid me, and my dad told me that I shouldn't make her pay for writing the papers. Had I known that would happen, I would have never agreed to write the papers.
Now here is the kicker: two months ago, I found out that my sister got pregnant and now she's getting a wedding, and people just keep sending her and her fiance wedding gifts. Had I done something like that, my parents would have made me get married immediately at town hall, and that would be the end of it.
Any advice on what I can do to calm down and not feel unappreciated because of these circumstances? Any constructive criticism towards me is more than welcome. Thanks",livingwparents,Feeling Unappreciated,https://www.reddit.com/r/livingwparents/comments/46ax3y/feeling_unappreciated/
