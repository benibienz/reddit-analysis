53,"Character Name: Liam the Stupid

Steam Name: stupidliam

Steam ID: STEAM_0:1:26379237

Character Bio: Liam used to be merchant but after a tragic loss of products was forced to take a perilous journey in a small ship across the sea. This did not go well either as he managed to terribly mess up the navigation and thus ended up in a opposition territory. After both this and then being ransomed back he then proceeded to screw up another merchant business and so was aptly named: the stupid. Even though it seems like he is a complete idiot many of the unfortunate circumstances he has been put in were due to poor timing and plain bad luck. An unusually happy and patient man, he will gladly give what he can to help others but he can also turn around and rob someone blind whilst they are not looking. He will avoid open conflict as much as possible but will do whatever he can for any find him as their ally. 

Difference between raid and war: A war is declared 24 hours before a faction attacks. A raids purpose is to steal resources while wars purpose is to do battle.
