7,"Under Islamic sharia law, the age of consent is 9. Why? Because that was the age Mohammed finally consummated his marriage to his fourth wife Aisha. The girl was 6 when he married her, and he spent three years humping her thighs until her vagina had grown large enough to penetrate. This practice is known as ""thighing"" in Islam, and is how Muslims are supposed to achieve sexual release with child-brides before they reach the age of 9, according to the doctrine of their religion. 

Under sharia law, all women are also legally defined as objects of property and must be owned by a Muslim man in order to exist: generally, the woman will be owned by either her father or her husband. This is called slavery. Islam is the practice of female slavery. There is really no way to state this more bluntly. If you oppose the slavery of women, then you must oppose Islam.

I used to be a fan of his, but when I found that out he was absolutely done for me. That level of smug pomposity and utter hypocrisy is revolting. Jon Stewart is a liar and a fraud. 

And *The Daily Show* never ""gave it to both sides"". I watched it every night and even when I was a fan, I knew that talking point was bullshit. He spends 96% of his time attacking Republicans, generally by taking clips out of context CNN-style, and then for the other 4% he spends attacking Democrats, he does it in the most gentle, warm-heartened way. He never once shredded Obama to bits the way Obama deserved. The go-to response was always ""well, he's too suave, you just can't make fun of him!"" but this dom has proven that to be a lie. Obama is supremely easy to ridicule. And look at all the epic scandals Stewart ignored, like Fast and Furious. That scandal alone should have been enough to impeach Obama, and an honest political commentator would have destroyed him over it. But instead - crickets. Most people don't even know what Fast and Furious is. They think it's a movie. 

Jon Stewart is a man full of hate. Remember that still of him sneering viciously into the camera on Colbert's show as he ripped into Trump.

136,"We may need more of a coordinated response to the left's slander attacks. Like what if every time they made these outrageous claims - like Bannon is ""an anti-semite"" or that Trump ""doesn't believe women are people"" - the go-to response was just: 

*Get over yourself.* 

Wouldn't that take most of the wind out of their sails? They *need* and *want* us on the defensive, explaining in facts and evidence why their ridiculous charge is untrue. But notice they never say, *Yeah, you're right. Looks like what I just said was a load of bullshit.* Never happens! When you prove them wrong, they just jump to the next lie, and the whole process starts again. 

The debunking is good, but maybe there needs to be less of it and more mocking dismissal. Because being dismissed as a joke drives the leftists *nuts*. They really hate being laughed at. Even Lorne Michaels, producer of SNL, when asked why his show only makes fun of Republicans, admitted it's because Republicans can take a joke, but when you criticize Democrats, they go insane, sending death threats, staging protests, writing letters to NBC and GM. Basically Michaels admitted he was afraid of their wrath and bent the knee. But what if he didn't bend the knee? What about mockery so frightens the left? Is it because it cuts straight to the heart of their self-image as ""the anointed ones""? When ridicule strikes terror in the left, I say don't appease them and stop - up the ante!

Basically he was using these quick Hollywood paychecks to fund his failing pet project, at the expense of his fans.

Even if you disagree with him on a few individual issues, by not being an ideologue he actually opens the floor to that disagreement. I think everyone agrees this is a healthy thing for a country.

They may have also had something planned with a protestor at Hillary's rally, but then she felt a drop of rain land on her and was like *I'm out, time for a nap.* 

Of course like usual all their meddling, if that's what it was, backfired on them. First, Obama's crowd way overreacted to their protestor and stole the momentum of the event from him, making him look once again like a stuttering substitute teacher in over his head, so that whole narrative was an embarrassing fail (hold up hold up hold up focus guys hold up we have a script for this listen hold up I have some lines here hold up guys guys hold up). And then second, Trump's protestor gets us one of the most badass photos in the campaign with a secret service agent diving in front of him while Trump just stands there like a rock staring at his attacker like *Nah, I got this.* ",2016-11-06 08:21:38+00:00,d9ny4y2,2,t1_d9nvsn6,7301.0,The_Donald

Leftists and Marxists *hate* organized sports almost as much as they hate organized religion (except for Satanism, obviously, which they think is edgy and cool). 

But sports are everything the Marxists hate: they're binary, with one team opposing the other; they have a clear and definitive outcome, with one team winning and one team losing; they endorse traditional (or toxic) masculinity; they inspire state, or national, pride, as opposed to globalist collectivism; they encourage competition; they feature clear and definitive rules, directly observed by in-field authorities, that every individual has to equally and fairly follow; and the base of people who follow sports are generally considered a solid, traditional, patriotic voting block - most sporting events even salute the flag and sing the national anthem before games, two things leftists/Marxists find offensive. 

So when they infest sports with their bullshit and turn the audience off, that isn't some terrible mistake they've made that will soon be corrected. That is the goal. Don't expect low ratings and angry letters from viewers to change the NFL or ESPN. Low ratings and angry letters are for them a sign *they are doing something right*.

574,"The climate change computer models are cooked the same way the election polls are cooked. The majority of them hide their methodology behind source code that no one outside the climate organization sees. That's not legitimate science, because it cannot be independently verified. Imagine a bunch of Nate Silvers hiding their algorithms behind academic legalese but always conveniently coming to the same conclusion that *yes, our field of study is the most important field of study in all the history of humanity*. 

What we *do* know though is that in order to get the drastic warming that Al Gore predicted, and which hasn't yet occurred, climate science theorizes that increased carbon levels will have an exponential effect on temperature *because of the amplifying effects of water vapor* (so, a snowball effect, where more carbon makes more heat which makes more water which makes more heat). Neat theory on paper, very alarming, great for funding, great for media, great for government, great for investors, but only one problem: temperatures do not appear to be responding in this way. Temperatures started to rise, true, but then they plateaued. It is now theorized by some scientists that water vapor may actually have a *limiting* effect on global temperatures by *neutralizing*, not *amplifying*, the heat-trapping effect of increased carbon. This could occur through any number of self-regulating systems, such as, for example, increased cloud cover. Interestingly enough, clouds are also eliminated from most computer models because they are too irregular to program. One of the founding members of Greenpeace, Dr. Patrick Moore, a PhD Ecologist, is a big proponent of this theory and would like to see it studied in more detail. 

Also, have you noticed how the Democrats have declared climate change ""settled science"" and now shame and silence anyone who dissents, even slightly? And yet somehow, despite all of this, they never quite seem capable of fully shaking their opponent off? That usually means there's some hidden agenda or fundamental lie that the Dems are trying to spin and pawn off on the public, and it's the persistent truth behind that agenda that just won't shake loose, no matter how hard they try. Very similar to Hillary's campaign right now, actually. 

I think Trump is ahead of the game on this issue and I think the reason the Dems aren't hammering him on it more is they know he could probably dismantle their whole damn theory in three tweets with nothing more than a clever turn of phrase. The GOPe has been tiptoeing around this issue for years, letting the media control the narrative, and refusing to challenge the Dems on it almost at all. Then when Trump came in he just straight up called it a hoax. That took so much wind out of its sails it must have completely thrown the Hillary campaign for a loop. None of their pre-packaged talking points work on ""hoax"", and the obvious pushback takes the debate somewhere Democrats don't want to go (skepticism). Trump has since softened his position, but it is interesting how such a bold opening stance completely threw off his opponent's game plan.

626,"It's also worth pointing out how cynically exploitative it was for the warmongers and neo-cons to hijack the peace movement and turn it into a giant beating war drum against Russia using nothing more than the power and persuasion of identity politics. 

All the Hillary supporters now suddenly promoting war with Russia would normally *never* advocate that position if it weren't for ""muh vagina"". But that's how deeply they're getting played. We now have Hillary supporters pushing hard for the exact same policies they used to oppose, and why? Because their genitals line up. That's it! Don't agree? Then just imagine if it was Jeb Bush calling for war with Russia, would the feminists agree then? Somehow I doubt it. 

It's actually kind of brilliant though. The warmongers and neo-cons in government knew that the only way to get the American people - and especially American *women* - hyped up for another decade of wars was to play the gender card, and it's working too, at least partially. We are now seeing all sorts of gentlefolk - the treehuggers, the peaceniks, the feminists, the hippies, the vegans - shrieking for wars of aggression against Russia, against Syria, against Iran, against Libya, even against China. They want cyber attacks against Russia, they want nuclear subs ringing the Chinese mainland, they want Assad's head on a plate, they want to attack attack attack attack! And these are the peaceniks! That is a remarkable example of psyops and war propaganda at work. 

But if they can convince liberal feminist tree-hugging women to draft their daughters for a war of aggression against Russia, then what's next?

634,"Communism/socialism/Marxism is all collectivist in nature. Collectivism *requires* groupthink, and groupthink requires zero dissent. Even *one* lone voice of dissent, *one* slightly differing opinion, *one* alternative perspective, is totally unacceptable because it inevitably begins the dissolution of the collectivist agenda. Once *one* person thinks outside the state-sanctioned box, then suddenly two people do, then four, then eight, then sixteen. Collectivism literally only works if everyone sees the same, thinks the same, speaks the same, acts the same, and believes the same. Under collectivism, all individual human activity must fall under the complete and total control of a central organizing committee. 

By contrast, America was founded on the principle of individual liberty, which is by definition anti-collectivist in nature (pursuit of happiness and all that). This is why the Trump Train is so diverse, not just racially, but even ideologically. There is room for difference and disagreement here, and since we are all individualists, no one really gets triggered by wrongthink. 

These two approaches to life - the collectivist and the individualist - are also reflected in how both candidates run their campaigns. As a collectivist, Hillary's campaign is focus-tested by a central planning committee who issues orders from the top down. She attempts to micro-manage every aspect of her branding and messaging while controlling the response of the people through her control of the media. As an individualist, Trump's campaign focuses on its own immediate goals, and displays an appropriate amount of leadership and problem solving, but when it comes to the electorate, they kind of just let everyone do their own thing and bring whatever individual talents they have to the table in an open-format, crowd-sourced kind of way. This is a messier, more chaotic, more uncontrolled approach to governance, but ultimately it's not as dangerous as the collectivists would have you believe because, as in any meritocracy, the good ideas will naturally rise to the top and the bad ideas will naturally stall out.

Take the most pro-abortion person, someone who even supports partial birth abortion, and ask them how they feel about sex-selective abortion. In China, for example, because of the one-child policy, parents will wait until the fetus is developed enough to determine the sex, and if it's male, they keep it, and if it's female, they abort it and try again. Odds are even the pro-abortion person will admit they find this revolting. 

But if the fetus is *just* a body part, why does the practice of sex-selective abortion seem so fundamentally and instinctually wrong to us? It should elicit no more of a reaction than the destruction of any other body part: trimming your fingernails, shaving your legs, a haircut. 

Obviously everyone knows abortion is something *more* than a haircut, so why do we keep peddling this fiction that the fetus in the womb is just a body part? This is the cognitive dissonance. ",2016-10-20 17:12:34+00:00,d90johy,6,t1_d90e0o2,6733.0,The_Donald

923,"Ask women voters who would make a better role model for the future of women in America? 

And before you answer, women, remember what Obama and the Democrats did for black people in America and realize: there's no guarantee they won't do that again. 

But ask women voters - who will make a better role model for girls? 

On the one hand, you have Hillary Clinton. And that would make her the first woman President. Wow, congratulations. Now take a look at what you actually *bought*. 

Open up the box and oh shit, that's right, it's f'n *Hillary Clinton.* 

She's not well. She's corrupt and crooked as hell. She's riding on the coattails of her husband's last name. She makes a mess of things with bad judgment and then spends all her time covering it up. She's a neocon warmonger in bed with the Saudis and the Bushes. And if she wins she rides into The White House on a tidal wave of corrupt FBI criminal investigations and scandals. A woman who smashes her phones with hammers to avoid Congressional subpoena. Nixon with a vagina. 

Be honest with yourself. This is not a woman anyone should be looking up to, and especially not young girls. Voting for Hillary will probably bring more shame onto women if anything. It's just the Clinton way. Think about what happened to all the poor blue dress manufacturers out there. Those jobs went to CHINA. 

Now on the other hand you have Trump. He's a brash billionaire playboy real estate magnate from the streets of New York who gives it to you straight and gets shit done. He's been hit with a lot of nasty smears by the dishonest press, sure, but if he wins and does a good job, as he has a pretty great track record of doing, then even *they* will come around. And the Americans who trust Trump believe that with all their hearts. They believe Trump really has the best interests of the country in mind and the people will unify when they see that. It's our best shot. 

And now you have the possibility of *Ivanka Trump* as First Daughter for eight years. And when you think about role models, think about *that*. Think about Ivanka's aura, her character, her intelligence, her grace, her beauty, her calm, her independence, her strength, her maturity. Even people who hate hate hate Donald Trump still have to begrudgingly admit they like Ivanka. And how many fathers out there would be ok if their daughters modelled themselves after Ivanka Trump? With some of the role models out there today, Ivanka would be a breath of fresh, wholesome air. 

I can picture Ivanka Trump, as First Daughter, doing a spread in Seventeen magazine about issues she considers important - education, unity, motherhood, entrepreneurship - and little girls actually finding her glamorous and aspiring enough to read the article and listen to the message. And I believe Ivanka Trump would promote a good, positive, strong message for girls. I think she would be classy and charming and respectful and down to earth all at the same time. 

But what could Huma and Hillary do? I just don't see them connecting to young girls in that *Seventeen* magazine. It would just be these over-Photoshopped photos of Hillary beaming away with her Maoist propaganda robot smile with all these meaningless politibabble drone-quotes that no one remembers or understands. All that empty rhetoric so precisely designed not to offend anyone. And the girls will flip right past it with a yawn. ",2016-10-14 05:58:21+00:00,d8rf4k2,1,t3_57e0ey,14951.0,The_Donald

Then add on top of this how much waste, fraud, and abuse the bureaucrats in Washington have been getting away with, and how that would have looked to a man who prides himself on being economical and efficient. And then as a builder himself, who knows exactly what it takes and what it costs to erect these massive structures, he would have had to watch the infrastructure of his entire country fall apart around him. I bet a lot of us who aren't experts in these fields don't realize a half of what the government is doing poorly, but as a builder, that kind of stuff would be impossible to ignore.

He is such a conniving abusing liar they had to scrape his own crusty semen off one of his victim's dresses just to finally catch him in an objective lie *with his own DNA*. That's how much it takes just to get a Clinton to finally tell the truth. These two are exhausting like that. 

Trump saying a naughty word in private on a celebrity party bus isn't remotely on this level. And this is what they have, three weeks before an election? These are their big scandals, when Wikileaks is revealing some of the most shocking news stories in the history of America. Possibly the grandest act of treason at the highest level of office ever perpetrated in the country - this is what they are ignoring. *This is Pulitzer Prize winning material here*. But what does the MSM focus on instead? Pussygate. That's called a smear. That's called opportunistic hack journalism. That's called state propaganda. If Trump is so bad, where is the decades-long history of abuse? Where is the poster board of women accusing Trump of crimes going back years? It doesn't exist, and as powerful as the elites are, they still don't know how to go back in time and change history (yet). No matter what they say, we all know their smears started the day Trump announced his candidacy. Remember that.

1115,"Another strong argument, especially for the feminists: in China, because of the one-child policy enforced by the government, many parents wait until the sex of the fetus can be determined in the womb, and if it's male, they keep it, and if it's female, they abort it. How does this sit with you? 

People have such a negative response to the idea of sex-selective abortion that it really pushes them to confront their cognitive dissonance on this issue. ",2016-10-06 17:34:20+00:00,d8gpezo,2,t1_d8glfjv,4826.0,The_Donald

1117,"The problem is science keeps revealing more and more about the stages of life in the womb, and none of it is really consistent with the leftist narrative on abortion. 

Like the discovery that the fetus has a unique DNA code separate from the mother. If you put a bit of DNA from a fetus and a bit of DNA from the mother at a crime scene, the police would think there were two suspects. Put the mother's DNA, some strands of her hair, and one of her fingernail clippings at the scene and the police will know they all came from the same person. So how does the argument that a fetus is a part of a woman's body hold any scientific validity? Clearly a unique DNA code necessitates, to some degree at least, unique personhood. 

Science has also discovered that fetuses in the womb exhibit REM activity during sleep, which suggests that they are dreaming. If a fetus is dreaming, doesn't that imply some form of consciousness, almost by definition? Seems a little bit difficult to dismiss a fetus as ""just a clump of cells"" if it is actually having dreams. ",2016-10-06 17:18:25+00:00,d8gom4e,4,t1_d8gm2hu,3094.0,The_Donald

If this is what happened, it just shows bad judgment. If she had not installed Wasserman-Schultz, she could have just run for the nomination on her merits which would have given her the ability to choose a VP nominee better suited to go up against Trump and his own VP choice, Pence.

So how does the media rob Trump of this advantage? Easy. They parse every sentence he speaks for any short string of words that can be taken out of context (or just manufactured entirely) in order to make him seem to be saying something awful.

1171,"For people who purport to love the natural world so much, leftists are strangely opposed to natural human sexuality. It's truly an ahuman philosophy. They are essentially Earth-worshippers who see humanity as an aberration. 

Earth-worshipping cults are not a new thing in history either. Before The Bible, which had the major insight of placing a singular all-seeing moral deity at the center of human consciousness, it was common for societies to worship either the Earth or the Sun. But by placing a sliver of divinity in every human being, Judeo-Christianity immediately granted all people an inherent moral worth. Without this, you get virgins thrown into volcanoes and Romans fed to lions for entertainment. 

Unfortunately most leftists haven't studied either history or philosophy deeply enough to understand that Earth-worship is actually an enormous step *backwards* in terms of human evolution. To them it's new, or different, and therefore that makes it inherently better in their eyes. This is one of the major reasons why they act and behave and think so regressively, even violently and irrationally. Once you remove the moral center from human consciousness then people are free to behave like animals.

This means they either have to believe half the country is evil, which instinctually they know is absurd, or that Trump actually *isn't* the evil cartoon caricature they've made him out to be, which they cannot accept, as it would require them to question all the sources of information that fed them this lie, which would undermine and ultimately erode their entire worldview.

I've wondered how a person would even spell out the noise he made, and I don't think it's possible.

Hillary just doesn't have the ability to make that kind of noise in front of the American people. It's too honest, too real - it exposes everything in his heart instantly for everyone to see.

This stuff has been going on for years, but Trump is just the first guy with enough clout, guts, and money to call it out. 

The way you bring back manufacturing and other jobs is pretty simple: don't let these other countries cheat. Renegotiate the bad trade deals.

It's hard to take on that many people all throwing accusations at you and not come off a little bit defensive.

I expect something similar might happen here. People will remember Trump defending his honor and making a case for himself, and will remember key moments and phrases, while everything Hillary said will dissipate into a fog of inoffensive blah.

Just before the Utah primary, a Cruz Super PAC - in e-mail collaboration with Cruz's campaign manager - went to the Mormons, shared nude photos of Melania Trump, stripped them of their GQ copyright so they looked like brown bag pornography, and in a bold headline at the top essentially called her a whore. So how did Trump retaliate? Did he call Heidi Cruz a whore back? Did he dig up nude photos of Cruz's wife? Nope. He went in the opposite direction and actually praised Melania's beauty through compare and contrast by retweeting an unflattering paparazzi picture of Heida where her hair is out of place on a windy day. 

That's it! That's actually an INCREDIBLY restrained response for any man to have when another man publicly calls his wife a whore.

So all the sleepers and activists and social workers and liberals and homosexuals and professors and Marxists and Leninists are being eliminated - physically, sometimes.

Normalization now. From now on, no more strikes, no more homosexuals, no more women lib, no more kid lib, no more lib - period. A good solid democratic proletarian freedom."" 

""Now to reverse this process takes enormous effort. When today, the United States had to invade Grenada, to reverse the process of subversion, some people said, 'Boy, this is not good. It is not kosher. Invade a beautiful country like the island of Grenada?' Well, why didn't you stop the process here, at subversion, when Grenada was first approached by leftists? Why not prevent Maurice Bishop from coming into power in the first place? Did the Grenadans want him? Very questionable. They didn't know who Maurice Bishop was in the first place. He came to power by coup d'état himself. Mm'kay? No, instead we let the situation develop further and further until the crisis, and then normalization very soon after, and THEN the United States decided to invade the country, discovering that the country was ABSOLUTELY a military base for the Soviet Union. Of course it's a drastic measure! Of course it's repeated that the Marine Corp. had to lose - what? - seventeen lives. Very bad. Why not stop the process before it comes to crisis? Oh no, intellectuals will not let you. It's 'interference into domestic affairs'.

First woman President is a really great honor and just throwing it at this corrupt old establishment crone because you're impatient for the accomplishment seems highly unwise. The black community got impatient and threw that honor at Obama without vetting him and look how destructive it's been.

Rosie O'Donnell absolutely started the feud with him out of nowhere. Who turns so vicious over such a minor story? Frankly it sounds like she was just mad she didn't get to see a pretty girl punished. 

From CNN: 

When Trump decided not to fire Miss USA Tara Conner after revelations of drug use, underage drinking and sexual activities, the co-owner of the Miss USA pageant raised some eyebrows. 

""I've always been a believer in second chances. Tara is a good person. Tara has tried hard. Tara is going to be given a second chance,"" Trump said on December 19. 

Conner was allowed to keep her crown but had to go to rehab. 

The next day O'Donnell, who was a co-host of ""The View"" at the time, criticized his decision, saying that she doesn't ""enjoy"" Trump and said he went bankrupt -- a claim Trump continues to deny, most recently at Thursday's GOP debate. 

She added that Trump is ""not a self-made man"" but a ""snake-oil salesman on Little House On The Prairie,"" and she proceeded to slam his multiple marriages: ""[He] left the first wife -- had an affair. [He] had kids both times, but he's the moral compass for 20-year-olds in America. Donald, sit and spin, my friend."" 

Following those comments, Trump fired back at the comedian and told People Magazine that O'Donnell is ""a real loser"" and ""a woman out of control.""
""You can't make false statements. Rosie will rue the words she said,"" referencing her claims that he went bankrupt. ""I'll most likely sue her for making those false statements -- and it'll be fun.

Did you know that according to the theory of CAGW, it's not actually carbon that is the problem, but water vapor? Because it is such a trace gas, CO2 alone cannot cause the kinds of intense, rapid warming the theory requires. It is impossible. So climate scientists introduced ""the theory of the amplifying effects of water vapor"" into the computer models to increase the warming output of CO2 *fourfold*. Only problem? There is *no known scientific mechanism by which water vapor increases the heat-trapping effect of carbon dioxide*. It's an unproven theory not supported by evidence. Look it up.

There is no explanation. A truly incompetent President would have at least gotten one or two things right for America, if only by accident, but Obama doesn't even have that. We have to turn to Valerie Jarrett and ask who is this Iranian woman living in the White House with him? Never before in history has a President hired a non-elected foreign-born advisor to move into the White House with him. And now Hillary wants to do the same with Huma Abedin, another plant from the Middle East? What the hell is going on here?

1742,"There are two (feasible) choices for President. 

According to Democrats, only one of those choices is allowed. 

If you take the other choice, you are a racist Nazi who must be shut down, attacked, fired, and cleansed from society. Your property may be justifiably destroyed and your physical person may be shot, spit on, bludgeoned from behind, injured, and even killed. Sure, it's crummy to shoot a guy just because he votes against your preferred candidate, but there are higher principles at work here! Like winning an election! 

But what I wonder is: how do they consider themselves pro-democracy when they only want one option at the ballot? By definition, democracy requires a choice between at least two candidates, and yet these so-called ""Democrats"" only want there to be one choice: their own. Do they not see the irony? 

One of the reasons I can almost see Obama calling off the election entirely, as some have hinted he might, is that it would probably work. The entire press and mainstream media would celebrate his decision, a majority of celebrities would say it was a bold but courageous move, and 90% of voting Democrats would immediately cheer and rush to his defense.

Of course there is a tipping point, and it actually seems to be backfiring now that Trump is calling them out directly. The further they stray from reason, the harder it is for people to follow them. Everyone has their breaking point where the cognitive dissonance becomes just too much to bear. 

As more and more people abandon the left - and stop trusting the media - the left responds like socialists: increase the propaganda, penalize those who stray from the in-group, and try to seize more control of the populace through centralized power. When the right has faced similar circumstances, they have tended to respond like capitalists: modulate the message in accordance with the free market.

It is fundamentally beyond the Islamic mind to understand the value of comparative analysis (A vs. B) as it is banned from thought by the Koran. Islamists simply cannot conceptualize the idea of justified criticism of their religion, just as they cannot conceptualize the idea of cause and effect, which was also outlawed by Mohammed. This is one of the reasons the Islamic world has invented nothing of value: without cause and effect as a fundamental base of reason, the human mind is enslaved to the whims of those who control it. The pathways of thought that would first be required for an Islamist to question any aspect of their religion, like for example the slavery of women, are not there because *they were never formed in the first place*. This is also why Muslims are so often unable to assimilate with other societies.

Islam is a violent conquest ideology and these lies about so-called ""hate crimes against Muslims"" are just one more step in their goal of Islamic dominance. 

Just think: if there are hate crimes against Muslims, where are they? Why aren't they being reported? We know that every reporter in the media is desperate for exactly these kinds of stories - so much so that they will even falsify them out of thin air - so why aren't they being covered? Answer: because *they do not exist*.

We have put up with beheadings, stonings, honor killings, stabbings, racism, sexism, terrorist attacks, lying, acid face splashings, female genital mutilations, the execution of gays, genocide of Christians, Holocaust denial, book burnings, gang rape, molestation of children, and human slavery - and all this from one group of people and one group of people *only:* Muslims.

He wants to make America 100% energy independent so that the country is able to free itself from the grip of Saudi Arabia. Once America is no longer dependent on Middle Eastern oil, the country will be in a better negotiating position when it comes to ISIS, Islamic terrorism, and the many human rights abuses in the region. 

His [energy policy speech](http://youtu.be/kNkYgdXPL7U) is a good start for more information. 

Climate change is exceedingly low on the list of global priorities, and continues to plummet by the day. The theory of catastrophic anthropogenic global warming (CAGW) simply didn't pan out. The models failed. CO2 emissions increased while temperatures plateaued - the exact opposite of what was predicted to happen. And this has been going on now for almost two decades, which is enough time for the trend to qualify as climate rather than weather. Even the IPCC has been forced to admit in its most recent reports that the original dangers of global warming were overrepresented by computer models. By all statistics, major storms, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, and tornadoes have all decreased, while ice levels in the Antarctic have increased. The doomsday predictions just haven't panned out, and are frankly starting to look a bit silly, which is why the politicians keep trying to tie ISIS to climate change.

The entire theory of catastrophic anthropogenic global warming is based on the amplifying effects of water vapor, and not, as they pitch it, carbon. Carbon, according to this theory, isn't the real problem - it's that water vapor will take the heat from the increased carbon and amplify it fourfold (x400%). This is why all the models run so much hotter than recorded temperatures. That might be ok, but *there is no known scientific mechanism by which this amplification effect can be assumed to occur*. It is an unproven, unverified theory. Many scientists, like PhD Ecologist Dr. Patrick Moore (a founding member of Greenpeace) even believe that there's just as much evidence that water vapor is having a *dampening* effect on the climate, specifically through increased cloud cover. Interestingly enough, current computer climate models remove clouds entirely from their virtual mock-ups of Earth's climate system because clouds are too complex for climate scientists and programmers to translate into code.

If Bernie ever made college free - aside from the fact that it wouldn't actually be ""free"" - college would just become another four years of glorified high school, after which you're awarded with a degree that means nothing (because everyone has one), and all the actual, true, deep-thinking intellectuals now have to go get their masters and PhDs to separate themselves from the bunch. Then, a couple generations later, all it takes is another Bernie Sanders type to come along and tell us ""all master's degrees should be free"" since ""everyone needs to get a master's degree"", and there we go: the process starts all over again.

He forced paid shills like Jake Tapper to drop their masks and come out as the bought-and-paid-for propagandists we always knew they were. Is it any wonder they hate Trump so much! He ruined everything they've been plotting and now they have no choice but to go forward half-cocked. It's now or never for the głobalists, and they know it. 

Problem for them is, Trump came too soon. The groundwork hasn't yet been fully laid, and the majority of people still aren't open to a North American Union merged with a European Union in a globalized New World Order under a one-world currency. Another generation later, maybe two, with another 40 years of leftist indoctrination through entertainment and education, another 20 to 60 trillion in national debt, and an American populace overrun by imported nationalists from other countries, and yep - the plan probably would have worked. But 2016 is just way too soon. And yet, the brilliance of Trump's move is: these fuckers have no other plan. They're stumped, and defeat is barrelling their way.

2045,"You do not understand the Republican position on life. This has nothing to do with women, women's bodies, or even specifically the procedure of abortion. 

Instead it is a question of *personhood*. 

Every human being has to ask themselves if an eight-month-old pain-capable fetus, with a unique DNA code, a human-shaped body, a beating heart, brain activity, and the capacity for REM sleep (which suggests they are dreaming) does or does not have *a right to legal personhood*. And it's not the open-shut case it's made out to be. 

Democrats want us to believe that aborting a fetus is really no different than a woman clipping her nails or cutting her hair, and that Republicans are just a bunch of uptight control freaks who want to tell women what to do. It's all a big power trip. But if that was really true, why do Republicans not also care about the nail clippings and the cut hair? Why do they not tell women what to do in any other area of society? How to dress, where to work, what to eat? Why is it just this *one* specific issue? If they are really obsessed with women's bodies, why don't they have an official position on tattoos, or piercings, or pads vs. tampons? Is it possible the entire debate has been mischaracterized by the media? 

The Democrats really need to be careful on the abortion issue, or else it could bite them in the ass in later years, just like their support of slavery is doing now. There, they defined a black person as an owned object and argued that the Constitution does not apply to property. Meanwhile, the Republicans fought for the legal personhood of blacks and argued that they, as human beings, should be protected by the Constitution as much as anyone. Similarly today, Democrats define a fetus as an owned object and argue that the Constitution does not apply to a woman's property. And again the Republicans are fighting for legal personhood. Now look at the rapid advancements in incubator technology and realize society is going to reach a point where any unwanted fetus can be brought to term, without the mother's bodily commitment, and that is going to *radically* change the abortion debate. Will people be so committed to abortion when it's rendered unnecessary? Will they look back on early abortion practices and consider them barbaric and inhumane? Will they once again say the parties ""switched sides"" and that it was really the Democrats who were on the side of life, not those na-a-asty Republicans? 

I am not trying to change anyone's opinion on abortion here, I am just challenging the ease with which the Democrat position is accepted. The head of the DNC is so in favor of abortion she even supports partial-birth abortion, which is a position the vast majority of Americans oppose. But the DNC is trapped because their entire argument relies on the dehumanization of the fetus, which means they need people to continue thinking of an eight-month-old fetus the same way they think of their nail clippings: dead objects of physical matter of zero importance. But nail clippings don't go into REM sleep, do they? How does one remain intellectually honest and square the objective, scientific reality of that fact with the feel-good, consequence-free, tweet-your-abortion narrative being pushed?

2066,"The problem with the Democrat's vision of an atheistic utopia purged of the ""religious right"" is that atheists immediately bend over to Islam as soon as it comes around and threatens to chop their head off. Atheists talk big, and act like strong men when they're dumping on Christians, but the second an *actually* destructive religious ideology shows up, they have no fight in them to resist. Generally, an atheist's highest priority is to live, which is how Islam gets people to submit: through the fear of death. Historically speaking, it was only another religion (Christianity) that had the guts, the organization, the message, and the moral fortitude needed to stand up to the caliphate and drive back the conquest of Islam across Europe. 

Even if a handful of atheists are willing to fight Islam to the death - and such people do exist - there are *not enough* of these die-hard atheists to defeat the millions of devotees of Islam. This is a holy war, ultimately, and atheistic secularism just doesn't inspire the levels of conviction needed to win that kind of war. *Christianity does*. Christians will fight long after the atheists submit. Look around - the atheists are even submitting already! See: the Democratic Party, SJWs, Silicon Valley, and most of Reddit (including r/atheism), Tumblr, and other social media sites. They submit because they stand for nothing higher than themselves. 

This isn't a call to a Christian theocracy *at all* - even most Christians don't want that - but it *is* a practical recognition of military strategy, and it's an acknowledgment that of the two major ideologies battling for control of the world (Christianity and Islam), only *one* of them allows people the right to choose their beliefs freely.

2085,"Who knows? Honestly I think it was less planned than that though. I think Obama knew it was a delicate situation and immediately pawned it off onto Hillary and went to bed, his thinking being if she pulls it off, great, he gets to take the credit for it, and if she fails, then he just scapegoats it onto her and she takes all the blame. 

And Hillary, I think, knew this was it: the real test to be President in 2016. If she nails it, she runs on her victory in Benghazi, and if she muffs it, she has to resign as Secretary of State and her entire Presidential campaign is now hobbled with a recent foreign policy failure. Those are very big stakes - very likely the biggest she's ever faced - and the pressure must have been intense. 

And what happened? Well it looks like she panicked, started to vacillate between all the different options, and finally just didn't know what to do. And in a battle situation like that, if you panic and can't make correct decisions - and make them almost immediately, on a purely instinctual level - then things go south fast. And the reason she failed, I suspect, is that she over-complicated the situation. Most of us know instinctually what the correct American response should have been: yes, you go in for the rescue, because American lives are at stake, and Americans don't leave other Americans behind. Period. End of story. And let the politics sort themselves out later. 

But see, what if instead of thinking about those Americans in trouble, you started to think about your own future goals instead? What if you thought about everything you needed to line up in order to win the Presidency in 2016? Because that's a *whole* different set of calculations. 

First you would realize that Obama needs to win in 2012 to set the Democrats up for 2016. But wait - Obama has just spent the summer campaigning on the killing of Osama bin Laden and the defeat of Al Qaida. And now you're going to send troops into another Middle Eastern country to fend off a military attack on the American consulate? That's no good. That is how wars start. And you're going to do this with less than two months before the 2012 election? That's really no good. And what if you send them in and it's a slaughter? How do you run in 2016 if you fuck this up? But what if you *don't* send anyone in and the slaughter is even worse? There's no guaranteed victory here. It's a big risk, with a big payoff - but then does Hillary want to gamble? Is it worth it to gamble? Or maybe there's a way to have her cake and eat it too. Maybe send the troops in only halfway, or out of uniform, or only send in a partial unit? Or maybe there's another, more diplomatic pretext for sending in troops. Is there even time to think of one? Is there a way to send in troops but contain any negative spin if they fail? Has any news of this attack been leaked to Twitter or the AP? What are the talking points going to be? Perhaps if we suppress the news of the attack then we can present it as something other than an attack. Hey, that's not a bad idea. A spontaneous protest maybe? But based on what? How do we sell this? Let's get our best advisors in here to work on the official spin. 

And all the while, shots are being fired and U.S. soldiers are fighting for their lives on the ground waiting for a simple decision from Hillary - send help or don't send help - but Hillary can't *make* that decision because for her it isn't simply *Do I help?* (which is easy: YES) but rather *How do I manipulate all the different variables in this situation - the President, the press, the military, the voters - to best help my personal Presidential ambitions in 2016?* That's not a simple yes/no decision, which means it takes TIME, and that time was very likely the window of opportunity in which the Americans in Benghazi could have, maybe, been saved.

Liberals adopt this form of mushy leftism because frankly it's the easiest ideology out there.

2224,"The redefinition of marriage could still have future unintended consequences. It's a social experiment in the making, and historically speaking, this is all new territory. Philosophically and logically, I do not know on what legal grounds we can continue to outlaw polygamy now that the definition of marriage has been changed to love. No doubt many people here are pro-polygamy and pro-open marriage anyway, but once the concept of monogamy is removed from the definition of marriage, the word itself begins to get pretty hazy. 

The casualness with which people divorce has been quite damaging to the institution too, but I think polygamy would be worse. When marriage is no longer between two people, and no longer monogamous, and no longer a lifelong commitment, I'm really not too sure what it *is* anymore. A kind of glorified ""going steady"" with a ring, I guess.

I understand the question is *uncomfortable* - nor am I saying I agree or disagree either way - but is it inherently *bigoted?* Is the discussion totally unacceptable? Must it be shut down, suppressed, deleted? Is there room in America for outsider ideas?

2296,"I think it might need to be something more visceral and obvious than a speech or a reframing. I'm not into identity politics but I think it would be difficult to call Trump a racist if he chooses Ben Carson as VP. 

People will still say it, but I think it would lose so much of its stickiness with Carson as VP. Even just subconsciously. Also it forces critics to call Carson an ""Uncle Tom"" which would be a great opportunity to reframe the attack. You would literally have liberals spewing the nastiest most hateful rhetoric about a black man. Consider the optics! 

Carson is also an outsider, so he renders any assassination attempts pointless, and he would be a great antidote to Obama for America in general, and the black community specifically. Let people see what a *real* American black man is like, not this spiteful Indonesia-raised Muslim-schooled half-black community agitator. 

A Ben Carson VP also has the potential to permanently DESTROY the Democrat's stranglehold on blacks, especially if Trump paired it with a major policy revision on how the government is dealing with the black community. Like for example: we're going to restore law and order to inner city communities ravaged by gang violence, because no American, no matter how poor, should have to live in that kind of fear. 

Carson was also the only person who ever led Trump in the polls, if briefly, and was almost attacked by the press as much as Trump was.

Look at what happens to the human face when acid is thrown on it. The flesh melts, but then quickly congeals in a hideous, awful way that is very, very hard to endure. It will wake you up *fast*. 

And all Muslim women who refuse to wear the black blanket run the risk of having this acid thrown in their exposed face. That is not freedom. That is being forced to wear something because the consequences of not wearing it are far too great. 

And let's not kid ourselves that millions and millions of Muslim women all just happen to think the black blanket is a really happening, stylish look, as if we're talking about the difference between thick heels and thin heels.

2378,"Except rich people and businesses pay the bulk of taxes, with the middle class making up the difference, so the premise doesn't really make sense. Warren seems to think the little guy's taxes are bankrolling the roads to the exclusion of everyone else, but the rich guys and business owners are paying for the roads and schools just as much as the rest of us, so what point is she really making? 

The folksy soundbite that propelled her to fame (and let's be real, that was ALL that made her famous) obviously sounded good, and caught on with Millenials, but it's pretty easily debunked. She keeps talking about companies paying ""a big hunk"" of taxes and the rich screwing over the little guy, but what good is any of that? What *specifically* does she want to do? What is ""a big hunk""? What tax rate does she want? And which companies aren't paying their ""fair share""? Name them. And show me on paper how they are cheating the system. Specifically. What law are they exploiting, exactly, and how can it be rewritten or adjusted to fix this problem. Otherwise, this is just empty rhetoric designed to denigrate entrepreneurs, castigate success, and encourage class warfare. 

But that's the problem with all of Warren's folksy wisdom. Maybe it flies when she's back home in her childhood teepee talking to her elders, but once you try to transition this stuff into the real world, it becomes useless. Perhaps she was *just* talking about one single event, like the GM bailout, in which case many of us would agree, but instead she seems to be attacking the entire premise of capitalism and private business ownership. Because as soon as she names any one specific company she doesn't like - say Pepsi or Microsoft - then the soundbite fails, because it would be supremely easy to show how those companies have paid more than enough in taxes to fund the roads going to and from their factories.

Sure, some people will call Carson an ""Uncle Tom"" but then that just makes *them* look racist, especially since most of those people will be white liberals, so it's a win either way. I think for a lot of people the cognitive dissonance of a Trump/Carson ticket somehow being ""racist"" would just be too much to bear. 

Carson is also very *gentle*. This is a big contrast to Trump as a ""mean"" guy and may be enough to temper that image. But it's hard to say. Carson's calm demeanor, his aura of healing, and his inspiring life story would all be a great antidote to the violent, hateful rhetoric happening in the BLM movement. Plus the fact that Carson is black on both sides, unlike Obama who is mixed, and the fact that he grew up in the projects, unlike Obama who grew up in Kenya and Hawaii with a silver spoon in his mouth, gives Carson a *lot* of potential credibility amongst the black community. A Carson VP slot would almost serve as an apology for Obama's degenerate Presidency, and could capture a lot of the reasonable black vote that in 2008 truly wanted to see a black leader bring the country *together*, not drive it *apart*. Sure, Carson is religious and the media will razz him on that constantly, but don't forget how religious the black community is too. They might not take kindly to Jake Tapper and Wolf Blitzer constantly shitting on their beliefs. 

Carson also doubles up on Trump's outsider image.

2415,"Conservatives generally believe that liberals are well-intentioned but naive, and don't understand the law of unintended consequences. They also feel that liberals are idealistic to a fault, and have an overly optimistic view of what happens when you increase government power (i.e., not utopia but bureaucratic sloth and waste). 

As often former liberals themselves, conservatives generally see liberalism as a product of youth and inexperience. As liberalism has grown more powerful and morphed into this SJW/BLM violent activism, though, conservatives have begun to wonder how well-intentioned the new breed of liberal actually is. These new types don't appear to be the lovey-dovey hippies of the '60s, but something far more tyrannical and totalitarian. Mostly though, conservatives still believe a majority of these kids are just temporarily brainwashed by their college profs and will come around soon enough, probably after they get their first paycheck. If they didn't believe this, they'd probably stop paying for their kid's tuition. 

Liberals believe conservatives are actually evil. They don't know what conservatives think about them because they would never consider actually listening to talk radio or Fox News or Breitbart. All that stuff is outright dismissed as evil, and then totally ignored. But if they ever ventured into enemy territory, liberals would be surprised to find that the conservative opinion of liberals is generally pretty moderate and understanding. Most conservatives spend their time fighting off the various misinformation campaigns the mainstream news media launches against their side, usually in a coordinated fashion (e.g., Journolist), than actually attacking. If anything, this is what has made the Trump campaign so new and dynamic in the American political scene. For once a Republican isn't just playing defense against liberals, but actively attacking back. And the liberals are *not* liking it. At all.

I've heard Islam disallows both qualitative comparison and the principle of cause and effect. Qualitative comparison means a Muslim cannot compare one thing to another to determine which they prefer, because the Koran tells them what they prefer. And cause and effect is rejected because Allah is believed to control all things, and is not bound by physical law. To entertain the idea of cause and effect, even briefly, is to insult Allah. 

As Dr. Bill Warner, one of the foremost historians on Islam, puts it: when humans reject qualitative comparison and cause and effect, the result is a total paralysis of the mind. If you ever wonder why so many Islamic terrorists seem like total automatons utterly lacking in self-awareness and self-criticism, this is why. Their enslaved minds literally cannot perform the most basic functions of thought that we in the West take for granted. I mean - who the hell would have ever thought cause and effect is *optional*.

It's like saying: ""Not all Nazis are bad people!"" Yes, it may be true - some Nazis *were* sweet, kind, loving people - but it still seems a little strange to run around correcting every criticism of the Nazis with: ""Not all Nazis are bad people!"" 

Of course, modern day culture uses ""Muslim"" as a catch-all to mean ""anyone from the Middle East"" so I understand the point being made.

2533,"Liberals don't believe in evil. If someone is evil, it's only because of society. All evil people then become victims, with the MOST evil being the MOST victimized. This leads liberals to coddle, protect, and defend the world's greatest evils - all the while seeing themselves as the height of good! Very strange. 

Ironically, this leaves liberals not happy, wise, and calm, as they like to imagine, but confused, frustrated, and dissatisfied in their day-to-day lives. At bottom, their philosophy still yearns for a framework of good and evil on which they may hang their identities, so they instead invent made-up and/or exaggerated evils that they feel safe attacking. And these targets they go after with a level of relish and hysteria totally out of proportion with whatever they claim the actual ""offense"" may be.

2611,"I just explained that statistics show the opposite: the level of gun violence in America is equivalent to other countries in Europe once you control for black inner city violence. Most European countries are racially homogenous and don't have this inner city problem so it's an unfair comparison. It's easy to keep gun violence low in Iceland where everyone is rich and white just like it's easy to keep gun violence low in Vermont, where everyone is also rich and white. Suddenly when you realize this it becomes a demographics issue, not a regulations issue. 

This idea that America is wildly more violent than Europe is a meme manipulated by liars who hate the United States. When you look at the actual data, the story it tells is far less sensationalistic and much more nuanced and complex, just like 1 out of 4 women aren't *really* raped in college and 97% of scientists don't *really* believe in catastrophic anthropogenic climate change and American women don't *really* make 79 cents on the dollar. This is all just politics. Not truth. There is an agenda in all of it and the statistics are massaged to push that agenda. 

Your mistake is you think an object is responsible for human actions. But if guns are the problem, why is Vermont so safe? They love their guns! It doesn't make sense. There must be another factor at play. 

We both have the same goal here: reduce gun violence. I think that's a great goal! But I also think you are not on the correct path to finding a solution. We can regulate and regulate and regulate some more and *it is not going to affect gun violence in inner city black communities* - who get their guns illegally - which means the statistics you want to see change *will not change*. And what is the solution then? Even more regulation? All that does is punish law-abiding citizens in Vermont and Texas who are not even the problem. I say focus on the problem - the real problem - and abandon these false solutions that sound good but ultimately do nothing. ",2016-06-14 13:50:07+00:00,d48pxf3,10,t1_d48of20,2533.0,The_Donald

2763,"I think the order they will push it in is: polygamy, then incest, then bestiality, then pedophilia. 

Polygamy is practically a gimme at this point, and I see no effective legal ground on which it could be blocked. 

Incest is currently very popular in pop culture and pornography. Hasn't that show **Game of Thrones** been fetishizing incest quite strongly? (I don't watch it.) With the astronomical rates of divorce and re-marriage, incest has become the cool new thing. They still couch a lot of it in terms of step-parents and step-siblings, to confuse people, but the underlying message is clear: incest is hot. Very gross stuff. 

Bestiality will require the advancing of human rights for animals. This push is already happening. Once animals are considered people, it will be easy to advocate for open sexual relations between man and beast. But this will also require that the eating of meat becomes illegal at best and socially unacceptable at worst, which is why they are connecting meat-eating to global warming. 

Pedophilia, I don't know how they will sell that one exactly. Salon is already making the attempt through the genetic argument, i.e., ""born this way"". The filmmaker Lars von Trier made the same argument in his movie **Nymphomaniac**: pedophile as victim. If Sharia law takes hold in the West, as is the goal, then Salon and their liberal cohorts will have a much, much easier job normalizing pedophilia, as the age of consent under Islam is 9, and a Muslim man may even marry a girl as young as 6.

Halfway through his energy policy speech is when he, I think, found his future style. And it's actually the opposite of Obama's approach, where he always tries to pretend like he isn't reading off a teleprompter. (Lying, per usual.) Instead, Trump just straight up admits he's reading a prepared speech as if it's a piece of paper in his hand, but then he keeps it interesting and alive and fresh by continuously pausing when the mood strikes him to make impromptu comments and give longer explanations about what he's reading. 

I prefer Trump with no teleprompters, but for policy speeches this works pretty good. 

It's actually a remarkable speech btw. It should be the top news story even today. Trump gives his First 100 Days Plan which includes making America 100% energy independent in order to put the U.S. in a stronger negotiating position against the Middle East.

They haven't learned that a dollar is a vote too. You get to vote every day with your dollar. What you want more of and what you want less of. Under capitalism you get to vote thousands and thousands of times a year.

They have misconceived the amount of existent wealth. They think the rich have an endless supply of money. They do not understand how printing money out of thin air erodes the value of previously existing money. They don't think that far ahead. 

They never put themselves in the position of the guy in society who actually does the thing they're talking about, whatever it is. Every real-life situation is viewed idealistically, in best-case-scenario terms. For example cops should be shooting perps in the knees. Zero thought to the pragmatic. 

They are still stuck on 1-2 step problem solving. Problem, fix. Problem, fix. If their fix breaks something equally important down the line they don't care. They push it out of mind. They judge an idea by its intention, not its result.

I haven't been here in a few years, so I didn't know you guys had gotten so crude and angry. Not exactly the image Bernie tries to present of his supporters. 

Do you also consider the wall Mexico built on its own southern border ridiculous? They needed a way to stop the flow of illegal immigrants from Central America and a wall was the cheapest, most efficient way to do that. Yet for some reason no one seems to be bothered by this. But if America wants to do the same thing Mexico did, suddenly it's a huge outrage? Seems... inconsistent. 

I also don't know how you make your open borders policy jibe with a big welfare state. There are 300 million people in the U.S. and 8 billion in the world, the vast majority of whom are much, *much* poorer than the poorest person in America. With open borders and a welfare state, what is to stop even 1/20th of those 8 billion from coming into the U.S. in order to live like kings? 

As Ann Coulter points out, even liberals acknowledge that America can't take in all 8 billion people on Earth, so even liberals want some kind of border enforcement and immigration control ultimately. It's not a ridiculous policy, and every other country enforces their borders as well. Why can't America do what every other country does? 

Incidentally, back when the U.S. was a ""nation of immigrants"" there was no welfare state, so the people who came to America either made it on their own or they returned home. Seems fair. One interesting fact of history is that of those early immigrants, well over half couldn't hack it and left. This allowed the U.S. to essentially skim the cream of the crop off the top of every other country - essentially taking only the best and the brightest from around the world - which is one of the major reasons for American Exceptionalism.

Most of what you hear about climate change is utter propaganda. Take the 97% meme - if you look into how that number was determined, it came from two studies, and their methods of arriving at the 97% figure are laughably corrupt. And this is the climate alarmist's biggest talking point! 

It is true there has been some slight warming over the last century, but this is largely due to the fact that we are still coming out of an ice age. And yes, in the late '90s global temperatures plateaued, and have not risen from that point for 18 years. This is why there are dozens of peer-reviewed papers trying to explain ""the pause"". Because it broke correlation; CO2 kept going up and up but temperatures didn't follow. Oops! That wasn't what the models said would happen - not at all. 

Climate change jumped the shark somewhere around the time environmentalists actually started making commercials where climate ""deniers"" are literally killed on screen. Literally blown up in front of children with bits of blood and brain coating the kids in their desks. And their desperation is only becoming more and more acute as their precious little theory dwindles. Climate change now ranks near the bottom of voter concerns. 

Solar and wind are also not paying off like they were supposed to. I get the appeal of the idea, and maybe some day in the future it will happen, but you can't just brute-force your way into making it happen. Someone is gonna have to have a major world-changing insight into how we can amplify and store the energy of the sun and still run our modern society with 24/7 power, which we need for a whole host of reasons.

There are of course some peaceful Muslims too. Most of these are Muslims in name only, as they obviously don't follow the text of the Koran or practice Islam in any important way.

The idea was that Obama's value system was identical to any other American's. But in reality he was born to radical atheist communists, was raised in Indonesia as a Muslim, and as an adult was mentored by known domestic terrorists and radical Marxist agitators like Bill Ayers and Frank Marshal Davies. ALL OF THIS WAS SUPPRESSED. The American people were sold a false package and the enormous likelihood is that if they had been told the truth, Obama could not have been elected. There just aren't that many Marxists in the country to elect him. 

Obamacare, incidentally, swallowed up one full quarter (25%) of the U.S. economy, and it was sold on a series of lies (""If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.""). That's no small accomplishment for a socialist! He also doubled the U.S. debt by more than every other President *combined*. 

The press has also been entirely mum on Valerie Jarrett, an Iranian Muslim who *moved into The White House the same day as Obama* and - according to D.C. sources, is the one making all the decisions behind the scenes. Never before in the history of the country has an unelected foreign-born individual moved into The White House and advised the President on his every action. Again - the media finds this totally unnewsworthy. Why? Jarrett has stated that her goals are a nuclear Iran and a more Islamic America. Does the press think most Americans share her goals? I suspect not. But that would put a damper on the Obama lovefest, so it must go unreported.

2996,"I have thought about this myself. I think one strategy will be to get Ivanka out there for the women vote. Melania too, but probably less so because English isn't her first language and she might get suckered into a trap by Chris Matthews. Ivanka is too sharp, too beautiful, too classy, and too kind - she can stump all these dottering old millionaire communists in her sleep. 

And ultimately Ivanka, Melania, and Katrina set up a nice identity play for women. They're all attractive, strong, intelligent, successful, entirely feminine women. They are what most women aspire to be. 

Meanwhile on the Democrat's side you have who? Hillary, Huma, Chelsea, and Debbie Wasserman-Schultz. All bitter frumpy old crones who hate America. Who really wants to listen to all their nagging? 

As to the abortion thing, Trump could possibly write an entirely new policy proposal on abortion that hits the topic from both angles, effectively taking the moderate middleground. The extremist right wants all abortions banned for any reason. The extremist left wants all abortions legal and paid for by the state, at any time in the pregnancy, up to and including one minute before birth. 

Now what if Trump slid right down the middle and took the position that polls say is the most popular: legal abortion but not in the third trimester. I wonder how women would feel about that? You still get to have your abortion if you make a mistake, but now you only have six months to decide. But once you reach the third trimester it's a no-go. Your baby now has human form, brain activity, a beating heart, and pain sensitivity - all indicators of life in medicine. At any rate most people have a hard time seeing something that's so clearly human as ""just a clump of cells"", which effectively neutralizes that argument. 

By taking this position, it would also force Hillary into the more extreme position (now in line with the official platform of the Democratic Party) which says a fetus isn't a life until it leaves the birth canal. Of course Hillary hates to say that outright in interviews, and will usually evade the question if you trap her on it, but the reason she evades is because she knows her position is actually not that popular. So Trump could hit her there, in her weak spot, over and over again. *Hillary supports abortions up to and including one minute before birth.* 

The one thing about this strategy that I don't like is now it makes the 2016 election about abortion. So there may be a faster way to trump this attack. ",2016-05-09 14:27:23+00:00,d2ylthf,2,t1_d2ykny7,1898.0,The_Donald

- Identity politics. Targets the black vote. Offers the black community an alternative vision of American governance than the one the Democrats have been selling them for fifty years. 

- Serves as a (small) slap in the face to Obama, who did nothing of benefit for the black community despite how much he used that side of his ethnicity to win votes. Carson as VP could contrast against this and reveal to blacks which party is *truly* on their side since the days of Lincoln. A foot in the door for future Republicans to help repair the struggling inner cities. 

- As a black man, Carson also freezes out the ""Trump is racist"" propaganda. Or at least knocks it on its ass. 

- As a surgeon, Carson would have practical, real-world insight into the health care situation, and could possibly oversee and direct the replacement for Obamacare. 

- As a black man born to an illiterate mother in poverty, who was raised without a father (I believe), and later struggled with anger issues in his early adulthood, he represents the American Dream in action and his message could potentially do great things to heal the black community and counter all of Obama's damaging Marxist rhetoric. 

- Attracts the strong Christian and ""true conservative"" vote. Cruz's supporters share much ideological overlap with Carson.

Sure, there's no more ethnic Africans on planet Earth, but hey, at least these white people string beads so the African culture and African spirit have been totally preserved.

Mexico does need to be fixed though. Ideally the people in Mexico would do it themselves, but since most of them just flee north, that isn't happening. A wall would force the good people of Mexico to stay there and fight it out. 

Also a wall will knock the legs out from under the Mexican drug cartels. This will give the good people of Mexico a decent fighting chance to take their country back. ",2016-04-29 07:11:16+00:00,d2ltdcy,2,t1_d2lt4vl,738.0,The_Donald
