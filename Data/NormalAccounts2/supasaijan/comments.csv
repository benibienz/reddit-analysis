2,9 WT and still no DB SSR for me. Welp that's why I have been saving all of the tickets from this WT for the Kid Goku Ape machine.,2016-09-11 06:06:50+00:00,d7hwubh,3,t1_d7hra2t,10501,DBZDokkanBattle

6,My point is awaken the cards that are most beneficial to the event and keep the new cards obtained unawakened until needed. ,2016-08-04 20:47:04+00:00,d64g45f,2,t1_d64fh2m,804,DBZDokkanBattle
7,No not really as you would use them as fillers and maintain orbs for attackers. And they can block better and link better than many awakened Rare cards. Base SR are better in most cases. Also dont forget not many even keep Rares anymore so awaken when needed.,2016-08-04 20:27:06+00:00,d64f5z0,2,t1_d64ezwy,212,DBZDokkanBattle
8,Haha I pleaded not to the devs but to RNG. Yea I do glance at it and use my dendes but still sometimes you forget to think and just move your characters around and start hitting. Then you a see screen that makes you feel like you've just been robbed lol.,2016-04-01 04:12:52+00:00,d1lehif,2,t1_d1lecxf,213,DBZDokkanBattle

11,I had that same thought too but I wanted to change it up. If I don't like it I will go with ATK boost. ,2016-02-08 19:13:15+00:00,czsilzw,3,t1_czshz49,886,DBZDokkanBattle
12,I am testing as I will running Kid buu as leader this time instead of Agi SSG Goku. I want to see if my cards can still 1 hit KO without the leader ATK boost. Although last WT I never had to use a heal item as I was using SSJ Bardock as leader. But it can help me gain an advantage in time versus others who fight against me. I am testing on Saiyan attack - Assault of the Saiyans. 5 types of saibamen. ,2016-02-08 18:43:31+00:00,czshbh1,1,t3_44s1t7,3314,DBZDokkanBattle

14,Start by taking advantage of the half stamina double xp till next week. Level up till 210 if you haven't. Then I suggest you get tournament wins till 23 wins. that will give you more stone rewards and then grind the prelims all day. It is very tedious hence I rather just get my 100 wins and then just stay in the top 5000. To be in the top 1k... dude it is exhausting. ,2016-01-26 14:24:42+00:00,czcj29y,1,t3_42rlz2,864,DBZDokkanBattle
15,"Congrats! I got the same buu last night! I did some looking... and I can tell you his Leader and Passive is OP! His links are not that great yet! But wait up and dokkan him, he becomes a beast. And that nasty 5 ki threshold turns to 3. His leader and passive take a boost so do his links, two links give him 15% atk boost, each. and retains majin for that extra 1k if linked up. and ofcourse a nice LR. I havent been able to conduct his stand alone attack power as I do not have him awakened as UR yet. Still grinding in the prelims now to get him leveled up. ",2016-01-24 14:38:10+00:00,cza0cpk,1,t3_42fy2w,2271,DBZDokkanBattle
16,Ok maybe I exaggerated the 10 mins but i believe it should be around 15-20 mins. which is including all rounds for the 1 win. My goal would be not getting most points in prelim but going through all stages as quickly for the win as time is what my biggest concern is. ,2016-01-18 05:50:50+00:00,cz2fm0j,2,t1_cz2fcbb,548,DBZDokkanBattle
17,"To clarify: More UR = higher team cost, hence you will be matched up with a similar team cost, which means you fight more UR characters. Now you use your UR characters with type advantage primarily, super vs extreme secondary, and thirdly a super attack if possible to maximize kill points. I don't know the points in numbers but that is how I got the most out of my kills. ",2016-01-08 17:09:01+00:00,cyqry2u,4,t1_cyqcv51,37585,DBZDokkanBattle

19,"From what I've read: More points come from fighting more UR characters and finishing them with UR characters instead of SSR vs UR. Hence I might just include SSG goku to the team which also gives back to my SSJ Bardock. My team outlook as of now is: SSJ Bardock (leader) AGI ssj2 gohan, agi max power roshi, SSG phy goku and super android 13/Teq SSJ 1 goku - however he is weak and really needs 6ki to hit over 9k.(for all those AGI god characters) and last is INT Cooler or Bojack. All will be UR. ",2016-01-08 03:47:16+00:00,cyq7rra,3,t1_cyq70jj,1318,DBZDokkanBattle
20,I don't think i will bother with raising SSG goku's SA at all! Too many assets and time to grind will go into it. As an extreme modifier is alright for WT. The real choice is from the attack. Really dislike that 4ki for 100% though. All UR adds is more chances to fight UR characters hence more points when you kill UR characters. ,2016-01-08 03:39:46+00:00,cyq7ig7,2,t1_cyq77vz,513,DBZDokkanBattle

22,By the way I had 8 stones left on the final day. Maybe I could have jumped into the top 1000. I had 23 wins and all of the points onwards came from the prelim. rounds. Tough grind with a team cost of 100 (full Frieza team with SSJ bardock as Lead).,2015-12-25 15:54:20+00:00,cyb05vl,1,t3_3y6tt7,452,DBZDokkanBattle
23,How are you sure he will have either a ssj3 goku or buu? Only teq ss2 gohan is the top prize character.,2015-12-20 03:21:27+00:00,cy55176,2,t1_cy51sij,5800,DBZDokkanBattle

29,It isn't a 17% increase from SSR to UR. it is just about 6.2% attack boost from awakening into UR. And then just +5 points or so per level till level 100.,2015-10-30 15:44:51+00:00,cwigbma,4,t1_cwif2j7,1932,DBZDokkanBattle

32,You won't need that 17% attack boost. His passive of +50% is more than enough to cover it up and he is already as Extreme Teq. That Supreme Kai medal can go into a better use later on.,2015-10-30 14:50:48+00:00,cwie93t,2,t1_cwie4bx,214,DBZDokkanBattle
