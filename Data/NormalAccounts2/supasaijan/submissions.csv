I might have figured out the marketing and business strategy for Dokkan Battle and the eventual decline of F2P players. I won't be using any actual data but a strong estimate.

So, as this is the first year of Dokkan Battle, BN will try to maximize their profits in the first year up until the 1 year anniversary or so! This means the power creep has not totally begun for Global (Broly and pending Cell and future events/summons). Thus as F2P players are still able to achieve a strong and consistent standing account. Not regarding any rerolls to restart during every dokkan fest or so as that is a new entrant and not a current account. And P2P will continue to shower BN with their $$$. The strategy right now is to provide a balance of characters and reach as much customers to obtain their $$$. The balance provides continuity and longevity in account activity. However...

Once the year 1 year has elapsed and the power creep begins to rise and the only way to remain a strong team to tackle more demanding events is to ""Summon"" that is when the demand will skyrocket for the Z tier characters. This will create imbalance and cost more $$$ to obtain these characters. Knowing the ratios it will be difficult for F2P players to pull and forced to purchase $$$ to pull and increase chances. But many will hesitate to purchase as I believe there is a more younger generation to this game. The amount of F2P players will decline as their will not be enough stones per say to achieve successful Z tier characters. This is when BN changes their strategy to just accumulate as much $$$ as they have created an imbalance in the characters. So be warned to the inevitable lack of free DS that BN provides and lack of F2P activity. 

Please provide feedback and your thoughts. I could be totally wrong and BN could change their strategy by increasing pull rates to attract more P2P players.

Notes: switch out Mecha for INT Cooler. I prefer Mecha. Or try your luck with INT Captain Ginyu to lock up all Supers. My Ginyu did not lock any supers in 2 attempts...

Turn one always use Ghost Usher as both Whis and Beerus launch Supers and your game is over! Always maintain 1 of each type of character per chain whether you break links or not. Blocking is KEY!! monitor your health and don't be shy to use your Senzu's by turn 3 or 4. 

You should be able to take at least 1 Super per turn, so maintain health above 23000. You can always use the quick exit and restart strategy to prevent game ending

Target 1 character at a time even with Super Attacks.
