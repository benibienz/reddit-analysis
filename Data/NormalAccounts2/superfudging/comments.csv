0,"As easily as trump got in, he can be voted out. The oscillation from left to right, right to left is the hallmark of a good democracy. Downvote me all to hell but its like Bill Clinton's views on guns. If your scared of gangs in the worst parts of an inner city you probably want very restrictive gun rights but if you are in a very rural setting with no town police force you need a gun for protection. Neither is right neither is wrong its a matter of perspective. So the oscillation and incremental progressive steps are what we are looking for. The only problem is Trump might be regressive with 2 steps forward with Obama and 3 steps back with Trump where generally its 1 step back. my 2 cents",2016-11-15 19:26:06+00:00,da1nn0t,1.0,t3_5d3wow,5550,Ask_Politics

Then the economy tanked all my clients dried up and lost my venue job. I took a temp job in healthcare just using excel skills for processing some backlog. Got a permanent position and moved up.

Now I work with the VP for a huge healthcare Corp make good money, pension etc and so project management work. But you say it's like you sold out. Cashed in is what I say.

416,"Let me ask the question why are you headlining? Headlining for a promoter means you have the biggest historical draw. If not you might just be filler for some support act that does not want the late slot.


Promoting tips would be one lead time at least one month. Send an email and personal social media messages. Take the time to connect to each person. Anyone who responds write there name down and follow up in two weeks then week of and then day before the show. 

Next idea is to go to similar genre shows preferably months before yours. Give people a reason to add you social media pages, free download or shirts etc... I personally like the selfie technique. You talk someone up ask to take a selfie then add/tag them. 

Really and truly promotion is about having a large list with as many differentiated data points. So you would be able to target them by age sex and location. Then target the best people for your show. E.g all ages show in your hometown is a different segment from 1000 miles away 21+ bar ",2016-04-21 05:18:21+00:00,d2bd6vx,1.0,t3_4fqs2j,12617,WeAreTheMusicMakers

I would suggest getting a job in any industry at entry level. Since Marketing/PR are in every business sector. Now follow your success not your passion. This will ultimately lead you to a job that satisfies you.

To answer how I got to where I am? I got a temp job working for the company I am at. Did that for 3 months. Then got a low level data entry position. Then a little better position. Then better.. then better and now I am a project manager assistant working towards becoming a project manager and eventually a director. 

Best advice with the entry level job is to interview your boss to see how you can get ahead or to interview anyone else you like on how to get ahead. 

Most of the jobs past entry level are politically motivated and require your boss and co-workers to give their gold seal of approval. Otherwise you will be stuck there forever.

I would say the stress is what keeps me motivated nothing grinds me more than not achieving my month over month increase. If i have to put in extra effort that is what I would. Without organization on sales how could anyone do their job. i.e. digging hold in the sand office job. I stay motivated by understanding exactly what is needed from me.

That’s the address of Donald Trump’s newest hotel. It’s within bullhorn distance of the White House and, get this, it just happens to be opening in 2016.

Sometime in the coming weeks, Donald Trump will stand in front of his new hotel, surrounded by journalist-filled moshpit the size of which most candidates can only dream of, and announce that while he won’t be living in the White House in 2016, he will be able to stay in someplace in DC that’s even nicer.

Build a base then leverage that with other artist in your area till you can fill the largest venue. So be the local booking agent and build your following. There is usually some type of scene you either fit with or need to go to. Then find where your music fits in the next largest city. The California example would be college towns up and down the coast. Build your list and have a goal of 10 emails/Facebook connections/tagged selfie/etc per gig. Put those names and demographics in an excel sheet. Then you can to promoter x I have a 200+ connections in your city and this local band can bring 100.
