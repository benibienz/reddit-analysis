As a child (let's say, prior to turning 25... that's about the time I grew up) I never wanted a girl. I understood boys b/c I was a boy. I knew how to deal with them. Women are enigmas. Pubescent girls are awful people. But then I realized there was a special relationship between a girl and her dad, and by the time my wife and I started down that path, I was ok if it was a girl. And then when my daughter was born, it was like a flood of realization about the responsibility that was before me. 

It gave me a lot of opinions on what it means to be a man. Being a man isn't anger, it's not yelling, it's not violence, it's not fighting, it's not impatience, it's not acting before thinking. Being a man is making right decisions, it's doing the right thing, it's treating people well despite how they treat you, it's fully assessing a situation, it's understanding through perception, it's remaining calm, and it's doing all these things in the face of adversity. I'm not perfect; I make mistakes. But I do my best to be a good man, because my daughter needs that. She must know what a good man is, so that in what will feel like a few short years, when boys are falling over themselves to talk to her, she'll know what is good in a man.",daddit,One dad's definition of what being a man means,https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/4r2jtv/one_dads_definition_of_what_being_a_man_means/

I just ditch Comcast tv and Internet. My family has moved over to a Roku 1 on an old style tv. Thanks to competition here in the Bay Area I got 110 Mbps and 1T per month of data for $44 a month ($39 + $60 set up fee) from wave Internet. Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon prime for free for a bit for the transition.

  
Overall great experience and don't feel like I lost anything I actually think I gained content. Big caveat is I am not a sports fan.  ",cordcutters,Cordcutters I drank the koolaide,https://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/3midnq/cordcutters_i_drank_the_koolaide/
