3,"You are right. 

But it is important to show that one single event can be used to create an illusion, a caricature, to define a candidate and even though it is based on a lie, the media will perpetuate the lie, even after repeated attempts to correct them, and even though they ought to be more professional and report the truth.

The next Libertarian candidate will be treated just as harshly and unfairly. We will not be able to get the truth out.

So candidates have to be able to parse their words more carefully, diffuse these kinds of situations by giving prepared answers, and move much faster in shaping the media narrative. 

The media is going to do their gotcha journalism, but the public is aware of media bias and a candidate that can excite voters will still persevere.

Libertarianism is the attempt to protect individual rights for all, particularly when governments try to limit individual freedoms via coercive actions such as excessive taxation, or through the use of force as in a police state or military interventions, or by limiting free speech or limiting personal choices when they do not hurt others, such as using recreational chemical substances like alcohol.

The only thing that ever has raised living standards, moved people out of poverty and improved technology is capitalism. But because the pure market economy can exploit workers and pollute the environment, a government needs to be independent and be able to regulate and address these issues, set safety standards for workers, set regional minimum wages.

What we have in the US is not a free market and not an independent government. Because of bought politicians like Hillary Clinton who sell tax loopholes, favorable regulations, etc. to political donors, honest business who do not pay off politicians suffer. 

This means that fair competition suffers. Bad companies are given unfair advantages, good companies get pushed out. Bad products then fail, people lose their jobs, consumers get less choices.
