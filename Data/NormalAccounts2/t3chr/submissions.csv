Gary Johnson wants to decriminalize drug addiction, END mass incarceration, end the need to build more prisons, end the police state and the need to go after nonviolent drug offenders.

Gary Johnson wants to end the school to prison pipeline, which puts poor kids in failing schools where they are treated like criminals, by allowing kids in failing schools to attend better performing private schools.

Gary Johnson wants to end Neo Con military interventions that have made the US less safe, more hated, and led to an uncountable number of deaths of innocent civilians.

Gary Johnson wants to reform the tax code, which is actually regressive because of the tax loopholes given to political donors like Trump, by bought politicians like Clinton, that allows these cronies to pay no taxes. By getting rid of the tax code, and replacing it with a Fair Tax, a simple consumption tax, the need for money in politics, bought politicians and pay to play, is drastically reduced. The poor get a prebate in the Fair Tax, and would pay no taxes, so it is a truly progressive tax.

Just 35% of the votes ends the two party system, which would be a bloodless revolution.

Also, the way things stand, Clinton will be resented and deeply hated by more than half the country. To really bring the country together, we need to choose a moderate who can appeal to both Republicans and Democrats.
