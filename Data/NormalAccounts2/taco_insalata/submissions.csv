I'm real excited to get out on them but I'm feeling a bit nervous. I tried some random rental park skis once and couldn't turn on them to save my life and had to switch them out for more traditional rentals. 

I know many people ski much wider than 85mm so is there any advice you can give me on turning and tearing it up on a wider ski, especially on groomers?",skiing,Need pointers on skiing a wider waist,https://www.reddit.com/r/skiing/comments/3tlxij/need_pointers_on_skiing_a_wider_waist/
