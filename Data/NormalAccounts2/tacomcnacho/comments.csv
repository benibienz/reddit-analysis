The discovery also adds another layer of tragedy to the Mass Effect universe's lore, because it means that the Krogan weren't just savages that were given high-powered weaponry by the Salarians during the Rachni wars.

I don't think that's going to be a problem in ME4 because the combat in the previous game was immensely fun. If they can build on that system by making team tactics more effective and necessary I think the system would be as good as it gets for a 3rd person shooter. ,2016-11-07 17:33:33+00:00,d9psktl,2.0,t1_d9pr3a4,1778.0,Games

151,"I completely disagree with the direction they took **Dead Space 3** but I still love the game, regardless. I dislike how they turned a hardcore survival horror game into a casual 3rd person shooter. Even on the hardest difficulty the game is a cakewalk for the most part. Ammo and health are found on almost every other enemy and they are some of the easiest items to craft in the game. Also, all ammo in the game is universal, taking away yet another bar of tension from the game. I was never without literally thousands of rounds of ammunition and at least a dozen medium medpacks at all times. Compare that to the previous two games where every Line Rack charge is worth its weight in gold and you're lucky if you have two small medpacks in your inventory. 

However, while I recognize that this change takes away everything that made Dead Space 1 and 2 the challenge that they were, **I also recognize that using a double-barreled shotgun/grenade launcher combo to blow the hell out of deformed monsters is fun as fuck**. Not to mention that the story, while arguably the weakest of the three, was excellent overall and I was genuinely interested the entire time. I had a blast with this game and I still find myself going back to it every now and then for another New Game + run. 

Another big reason this game lacks the tension and suspense of its predecessors is that Dead Space 3 has a Co-op mode. Normally, I would be more annoyed with the devs for including such a completely unnecessary feature into a game where it has no business. I would be, if the game's horror aspect wasn't already cut in half by the abundance of ammunition and health. If you're going to turn a survival horror game into a 3rd person shooter, you might as well include Co-op, right? And man, did I have fun with it. The day it came out, me and my buddy stayed up all night and half way through the following Saturday beating this game. The highly detailed crafting system was a major factor in the amount of fun we had with the game. By the end of the game, we had our weapon coordination down to a T. I carried the heavy weapons, he handled the crowd control; nothing stood a chance. 

So ya, despite all its flaws, I really enjoyed Dead Space 3. There are a lot of other things I could complain about (such as the replacement of Power Nodes with crafting materials) but the game was solid enough that I can forgive most of them. Had we gotten Dead Space 3 before Dead Space 1 or 2, I think we would look back at it as one of the best games of last gen. ",2016-11-06 03:51:39+00:00,d9nri6i,1.0,t3_5bbzid,26307.0,Games

156,"That's just the nature of 40k games. However, a bad 40k game doesn't really mean anything because they're all handled by different devs. Games Workshop uses a shotgun liscence strategy with the 40k universe. They chop up their liscence and give it to a large number of small-medium devs in order to get as many 40k games out there as possible. Naturally, this is going to result in many mediocre games, a lot of bad ones, and a few really, really good ones. This strategy holds virtually no risk to GW, as no one who plays the tabletop games is going to stop playing because of a bad video game, but there is a good chance that someone who plays one of the 40k games might become interested in the tabletop game, which is where their real money comes from.

One of the points he made was that because we knew the fate of Reach, there was no tension as there was in previous Halo installments. I think the fact that we knew what was going to ultimately happen to Reach mixed with the amazing cinematography and sound track gave the game's story a level of sadness and dread that we hadn't seen before. 

It seemed like the only good thing he had to say about the game was that the vehicles had been improved, which is hardly fair, imo. I think the level design in Reach is its biggest flaw. As he pointed out, Bungie completely dropped the ball on Winter Contengincy (the first level) with the anti-climactic Covenant reveal. There were so many missed opportunities in the game's levels.

320,"Looks like a generic teen superhero film, tbh. The problem is that they either went too serious and completely missed the heart of what people love about Power Rangers or they didn't go serious enough. 

There are 2 ways to make a film based on a beloved children's franchise: 

- A) You retain the campiness and light-hearted nature of the source material. That means X-treme sports, characters that are completely confident and charasmatic, no drama, flashy, unpractical weapons, and giant robots. Imagine Mighty Morphin Power Rangers with a high production quality.

- B) You go for the R rating and appeal directly to the fans of the original in a grittier version of the source material.

This movie will be right there in the middle where it's safe, along with Michael Bay's awful Transformers films. It will be too slow to appeal to young children and too filled with teen drama to appeal to adults.

John Hammond realized his mistake by the end of the film (well, in the book he didn't and he was justly killed by his creations). At the end of the hacking scene when he hears the raptors breaking it to the room his grandchildren are in he screams for Grant to shoot it. He deluded himself into thinking that the situation wasn't as bad as it looked and that afterwards things would go back to normal. We see him slowly come to the conclusion that the park was a mistake as the film progresses. Hammond is not a good man, or a bad man, he's just an old man who let his dreams blind him from reality.

Claire, on the other hand, is never confronted by her mistake. When One tells her to evacuate the park, her response is ""you are not in control!"" She refuses to give the order just so that she doesn't look like she's lost control in front of her subordinates. That would be fine.. if the film didn't just pretend that she did not cause the deaths of hundreds of people because of her pride and made her out to be a hero by the end of it. Trevorrow makes Clair out to be the protagonist of the film when the only useful thing she did in the entire movie was make the T-Rex follow her to the Terrorasaur or whatever it's called. Like I said, I would be fine with Claire making a horrible decision that killed everyone if it wasnt ignored.",2016-10-01 04:15:40+00:00,d898dok,,t1_d896ngj,3337.0,movies

The guys that bullied me never did anything physical; I was stronger than they were and they knew it. It was always just little things here and there. Stuff that you couldn't really make a big fuss over in the moment without it looking like you're over-reacting. They would try to make me look stupid in front of others by asking me what seemed like reasonable questions at first and then getting me to say something that made me look like I was trying to sound smart or that would get me to reveal something embarrassing about myself. Then they would spread rumors about stuff I said and their friends would tease me about it later. All of it was stuff that could be seen as harmless teasing but they did it constantly and man did it bother me by the end of high school. My advise to anyone in that sort of position is to confront it. That doesn't have to mean hitting anyone, it just means making it clear to that person that you aren't gonna take shit from them anymore and that what they're doing isn't okay.

389,"Ya I put it in my MP Missions folder and I still can't get it to work. RHS is the best way to play, imo. The vehicles are more useful for the mode it makes you feel like you're Owen Wilson in Behind enemy lines with all the early 90s assets, especially when you play on the European maps. 

The Tanoa port also adds a bunch of stuff to the mod that really makes a difference like the fact that there are useable planes at the airports and more varied weapons and equipment than the original vanilla mod.  

I do wish there were random weapons caches throughout the map. It would give the player an incentive to search buildings and would add a lot of 'risk/reward' to the mod. Do I risk staying in this village to search for weapons when there are enemy patrols around or do I just go for the weapons depot? I wouldn't want DayZ level loot where you can't walk into a building without stumbling over a suitcase but a sniper on top of a roof would be a cool find. Pre-place vehicles would he really cool, too.

390,"Just so everyone knows, this mod is extremely fun; possibly the most fun you can have by yourself in this game. I've probably put over 100 hours into it. You start out in a random location on the map inside of a makeshift prison, surrounded by 3-4 armed guards. There is a backpack with a random, low power weapon next to you. After killing all the guards, you need to gather all the weapons and armor you can from them and set out to find a map, which will tell you where to find communications centers, mortar emplacements, and weapons depots. In order to get a map, you need to find and kill enemy patrols, all the whIle avoiding tanks and enemy checkpoints. Not every patrol is going to have maps on them, but they may have heavy weapons or special equipment that will help you win. If you get into a fire fight and it lasts too long, a helicopter will be sent to the area which will track you and send enemy reinforcements to your posistion.  

The goal of the game is to hack a terminal in the center of a communications center and then get to an extraction zone, where you need to pop smoke to summon a rescue chopper. The communications center are heavily guarded, typically with 20-30 guards as well as armored vehicles and MGs. Sneaking in is virtually impossible so the only way to get to the terminal is to either attack a less guarded weapons depot, which may have drones, snipers, heavy weapons, and a vehicle or find an armed vehicle on the map and hijack it. The relief and satisfaction you feel after getting into the safety of an armored humvee after ambushing a group of 10 sentries is indescribable. If you die, you start from the beginning in another rsndom location and you will die a lot. Even after 100 hours 300+ restarts in this mod, I have yet to beat it and I'm still not bored of it. It can also be played with others but I have never gotten the multiplayer in this mod to work. It supports a ton of popular maps as well as the RHS mods and CUP. I highly recommend it!

The bike is so much heavier and so much taller than what I'm used to that I can barely handle getting it out of a parking space without difficulty. I don't regret buying it; I purchased the bike so that I could go on longer trips while still being able to go off-road without breaking the bank.

Its the same thing here; why does GITS *need* to be made into a live-action film? Its already an animated one. I'm not saying that animation or literature is inherently better than live-action at all, just that I find it strange that even after all the flops we still push for live-action adaptions for every type of critically-acclaimed media.

420,"In addition to the trophy hunting program, there are also programs run by Anti-Poaching Units across Africa that allow people who have always wanted to hunt exotic animals but don't want to further endanger them (yes, believe it or not most hunters actually care about animal conservation) to have a psuedo-hunt for them. The hunters are given tranquilizer rifles and are allowed to track the animals just like they would in a real hunt. When an animal is spotted, the conservation team is contacted and moves into position. The hunter is then given the okay to tranquilize the rhino, elephant, etc. This allows the team to dehorn/detusk and tag the animal while it sleeps. Tracking is very time consuming and expensive for conservation groups; this program turns a liability into an asset. The hunter gets the satisfaction of hunting an exotic animal and the conservation group gets the funding it needs while also eliminating one of their biggest resource sinks. The hunter even gets a mold of the horn/tusk after the hunt as a trophy! 

This is a pretty new program so there isn't a whole lot of information on it but it is something I came across while doing research for a conservation paper.

535,"I've gotten $60 worth of enjoyment out of the game but almost in spite of it rather than because it was a great game. The foundation of a brilliant game is there but nothing is polished and many of the mechanics aren't fleshed out. For example, they gave the player the ability to haul vehicles in boats and planes but not only is this completely useless, most of the time the vehicles simply explode, killing you as soon as you take off. Had this mechanic been fleshed out, it could have allowed the player to airdrop troop-filled armored vehicles into an enemy base, which would have been amazing. The game's motorcycles do not work at all. I've seen open-world mobile apps that handle better than the motorcycles in JC3. Vehicles have a tendency to explode for no reason, causing players to get frustrated and give up when they try to experiment with the cables. The game's map consists of over 50% water but there is *nothing* to do on it. The boats are incredibly boring to drive and there is nothing to explore underwater. Worst of all, the main island is one of the most boring open world locations I have ever seen. The southern islands have caves to dive through, bridges to play with, towns and bases on interesting locations, but the northen island is so flat and dull in comparison.

TL;DW: The main reason for this is because the rifle wasn't designed to fire NATO rounds, which have brass casings and heavier grains. The blowback from the FAMAS is too powerful for these weak casings and the rifling is too slow to stabilize the heavier NATO bullets so France has been forced to manufacture its own steel-casing 5.56 rounds. For some reason (steel shortage?) these rounds are no longer manufactured in France and have to be imported. 

The inconvenience of not being able to share ammunition with NATO allies and the cost of importing has finally forced France to change service rifles. I'm surprised to took them this long. ",2016-08-09 22:45:39+00:00,d6b1paz,1.0,t3_4wywvz,1156.0,videos

After middle school I switched to Adderall. The symptoms weren't quite as severe but they were still there and were having a massive impact on my social life.

You might think that's a good thing; it keeps kids from over-eating. The problem is that this lasts for well over a day from just a single, 30mg pill. I was *never* hungry even if I hadn't eaten anything all day. Naturally, I was very skinny for most of my youth. 

These days I take Focalin, but only on occasion. It does help me focus and I feel much more confident when I take it but it still comes with a loss of appetite and a general fuzziness. I know Adderall and Ritalin has helped a lot of people but I think its important to know that it isn't a solution for everyone. If its interfering with your personality ask for a change; don't just keep taking it because that's what the doctor said to take. ",2016-08-09 04:59:54+00:00,d6a0ucx,1.0,t3_4wsmjy,26885.0,videos

Each of the game's many areas were absolutely stunning. There have been few linear games where I have felt such excitement to see what awaited me around the next corner. At one point you might come across a beautiful Palace garden and the next, a dusty, ruined catacomb. Even though I just recently revisited the game, I have an overwhelming desire to revisit the game just thinking about all the great levels it had!

Not only were the game's levels and puzzles fantastic, it also introduced groundbreaking combat mechanics and animations. The more I think about it, the more amazed I am at all the things this game let you do. The *Reverse Time* ability was absolutely perfect. It worked so well in both the parkour and combat aspects of the game, both of which could be immensely challenging at times. Even without the ability, the game would still be remembered as one of the greatest games of all time. ",2016-06-27 03:31:52+00:00,d4perv9,1.0,t3_4pwkam,75856.0,Games

In all honesty, I would be fine with this game being one giant interactive cinematic. I'd rather have a rich movie-esque experience than a visually impressive, but dull gameplay one. I'm primarily concerned with how player movement will work in this game. The impression I've gotten from what they've released so far is that this it will be a story-driven open world survival game. I would really rather not have to teleport everywhere like you do in most VR games at the moment. I never thought I'd say this but I think an on-rails experience would be better than having the player awkwardly jump around in the environment to hide from dinosaurs if that's what they plan on doing. There would still need to be player input for this to work, certainly. I don't know, I guess I'm just not very imaginative. I really don't see how this is going to work as a traditional game.

643,"Right, lots to say about this:

- First of all, I was sold on the game as soon as the main character hopped on his bike. Even though we only saw a few seconds of riding, what was shown was easily the best motorcycle mechanics I have ever seen in a video game to date. I have never played a single video game with remotely acceptable motorcycle riding mechanics but I just may when this game comes out. I'll have to see more to be certain. Gotta say though, an [adventure tourer](http://i.imgur.com/tsxeB6t.jpg) would have been a much better choice for the apocalypse than a modified cruiser. Just sayin'.

- The animations are incredibly smooth, especially the transitions between them. Most games have a slight but noticeable break between each animation but in this demo it seemed like each motion the character made from jumping onto a pile of bricks to throwing a zombie's head into a saw felt natural, as though that was what the character was going to do all along. Let's hope that's not the result of heavy scripting. 

- The gunplay definitely needs work. For one thing, shooting the zombies didn't feel satisfying at all. There was no noticeable impact from the gunfire, the zombies simply fell over and died when a bullet hit them. A boost to the sound effects and blood splatter could improve this but obviously there's a lot more to it than that. Secondly, the way the player has to shoot the zombies was incredibly frustrating. It got really annoying watching the player character run away then slowly turn around and carefully aim at each individual zombie only to repeat this process until the end of the video. An auto-lock feature like that of Uncharted (where the gun will fire at the closest enemy in front of you when the trigger is pulled) could vastly improve the speed and satisfaction of the gun combat. Considering that Bend Studios has ties with Naughty Dog, this mechanic would make sense being in the game. Being able to blind fire behind you would help a lot, as well. 

- I think the way the player can interact with the environment is a great mechanic in the game. Being able to cut a rope and release a bunch of logs whilst running away is really cool. I also really liked the way the player character can use objects in the environment to quickly and brutally finish off enemies. 

 
- Also, who the hell was controlling the character in this demo? I mean really, who starts firing into a crowd of zombies when there is a flood of them sprinting up the stairs towards you?",2016-06-14 02:13:45+00:00,d4873so,1.0,t3_4nyz46,3203.0,Games

I have never played an open world game that had even remotely acceptable motorcycle mechanics. As a dual sport rider myself, I'm giving this demo my seal of approval! It doesn't look perfect by any means. For instance, I think that it could use a lot more animations to break up the static look when the player is riding in a straight line. Having the player character alternate between a squatting and standing position and having the rear tire bounce more to simulate riding over rough terrain would do wonders to improve the overall feel of the experience.

I believe its a mix between sound effects, recoil, blood splatter, enemy reactions, damage dealt, and player feedback (hitmarkers, damage numbers, etc).  

Edit: Actually, the 3rd person view gunplay looked great now that I've looked at it more closely; it's the 1st person combat that I think doesn't fit well.

I'm not interested in watching novice adventure riders brood over how difficult their journey is while listening to some hipster try to inspire me.

&gt;be able to swap 2 sets of wheels for road/dirt

Not necessary but that's up to you. The T-dub has a very large rear tire, making for a comfortable ride no matter what kind of tire you have on it. 

Pros:

- Low/easy maintenence

- Very durable

- Large rear tire for comfort, safety, and utility.

- Highly customizable

- Large friction zone on the clutch

- Perfect for short riders

- Lightweight  (280 lbs)

- High gas mileage (60-70 mpg)

- Looks badass

Cons:

- Low torque/Low top speed (50-65mph)
(Can be adjusted with different sprocket ratios)

- Uncomfortable for riders over 6'.

- Uncomfortable seat (easily fixed with cheap aftermarket products).

- No ABS (it's a dual sport)

- 1.5 gal tank.

That's probably the best way to ensure no one listens to anything you have to say. The reason circumcision is so common in America is because it is still believed by many that it prevents debilitating penial skin disorders. This is true in some cases; circumcision would prevent disorders such as phymiosis, an irregularly tight foreskin which causes discomfort, and Balanitis, which can develop on infected foreskins caused by allergic reactions to soap and spermicides. However, most cases of phymiosis are wrongly diagnosed; many babies simply have tighter than average foreskin which they grow out of. Also, Balanitis can be easily prevented by teaching proper hygiene and by recognizing allergic reactions before they can cause infections.

971,"I thought it fit perfectly; Batman needs a way to even the odds when up against an enemy that controls an army, though I agree they could have done more with the tank mode than just puzzle solving and tank-to-tank combat. It did give Arkham Knight the leap over Arkham City that it had to Arkham Asylum in terms of mechanics. They basically perfected their hand-to-hand combat with AC, so there wasn't much more they could do there without having the entire system crumble under its own weight. The tank combat gives an extra layer of diversity to the game which breaks up the monotony of the combo system. ",2016-03-29 12:27:00+00:00,d1hkkea,3.0,t1_d1hk70u,861.0,Games

973,"**Batman: Arkham Knight**. Specifically, the Batmobile gameplay. I honestly have no idea what anyone was complaining about when they said the vehicle combat felt dull and overused. This seemed to be the general consensus in the reviews about the game. Arkham Knight has, hands down, the best vehicular combat I have ever played. After 40 hours, I'm still not bored of hitting the L1 button, watching the Batmobile scream around the corner and to a halt as Batman jumps in, and hitting the boost to neutralize and cripple a pair of evildoers driving their Honda Civics around in *my* city. The transition from car to tank mode feels absolutely seemless, and the tank combat was just as challenging as the hand-to-hand when you were faced with larger numbers. It handles just like I always imagined the Batmobile would feel: Heavy and armored but also quick and powerful. The city layout couldn't have been better. There are shortcuts and alternate routes every few feet, meaning that even if you take the wrong turn in a pursuit, you may end up being rewarded for it if you can maneuver through a tighter space. 

Honestly, I think the game is arguably better than Arkham City in every way besides story, and even that isn't far behind. I believe it was a great end to Rocksteady's Batman. ",2016-03-29 11:37:37+00:00,d1hjedj,1.0,t3_4ce9bx,19425.0,Games
974,"And now none of this matters because [Jeff has explained the real reason the pose was cut](http://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20743015583?page=11#211) after the sudden explosion of controversy over it. 

&gt;*Well, that escalated quicklyâ¦*
&gt; 
&gt; *While I stand by my previous comment, I realize I should have been more clear. As the game director, I have final creative say over what does or does not go into the game. With this particular decision, it was an easy one to makeânot just for me, but for the art team as well. We actually already have an alternate pose that we love and we feel speaks more to the character of Tracer. We werenât entirely happy with the original pose, it was always one that we wrestled with creatively. That the pose had been called into question from an appropriateness standpoint by players in our community did help influence our decisionâgetting that kind of feedback is part of the reason weâre holding a closed beta testâbut it wasnât the only factor. We made the decision to go with a different pose in part because we shared some of the same concerns, but also because we wanted to create something better.* 
&gt; 
&gt; *We wouldnât do anything to sacrifice our creative vision for Overwatch, and weâre not going to remove something solely because someone may take issue with it. Our goal isnât to water down or homogenize the world, or the diverse cast of heroes weâve built within it. We have poured so much of our heart and souls into this game that it would be a travesty for us to do so.*
&gt; 
&gt; *We understand that not everyone will agree with our decision, and thatâs okay. Thatâs what these kinds of public tests are for. This wasnât pandering or caving, though. This was the right call from our perspective, and we think the game will be just as fun the next time you play it.* 
&gt; 
&gt; *If it isnât, feel free to continue sharing your concerns, thoughts, and feedback about this and other issues you may have with the game, please just keep the discussion respectful.* 
&gt; 
&gt; *Thanks,*

Yes, you could decide to do every side mission just after you've learned that your friend has been captured and is about to be killed but the voice acting and writing were both so great that it never crossed my mind to do so. I was so enveloped in the story at the urgent moments that even though there was no time limit for getting to the next objective I would glide as fast as I could across the map to reach it. I *was* the Batman in these games; playing the game in a way that aligns with Batman's character felt rewarding. I would hold off on the side missions until after missions with less urgency because that felt like the right time to do them. In short, if your story, writing, and voice acting are good enough, the problem of main quest urgency vs player freedom will solve itself because the player will feel inclined to play the game at a pace that feels the most rewarding to them in terms of story experience.",2016-03-24 06:31:01+00:00,d1bhswz,1.0,t3_4bmz4w,53793.0,Games

991,"Man, this hit close to home. I'm a 23 year old male and have never felt a desire to be in a relationship with anyone. I still have a normal sex drive and have the capability for romantic feelings but I've never wanted a romantic relationship. This is likely a result of me being prescribed Ritalin at the age of 10, which I took every day for the next 7 years. While most kids from the age of 12-17 were learning how to date and maintain healthy relationships with the opposite sex, I felt no desire to participate in any of it because of the negative effects Ritalin had on me like sever emotional repression. From the moment I took Ritalin I was basically a zombie for the next 8-10 hours. I didn't want to talk to anyone, least of all ask anyone out on a date. I know the drug worked for some kids but for me, it was a big mistake. One that I'm still paying for to this day. 

Reasons for my situation aside, the fact of the matter is that I don't want to be in a relationship. I've been single my entire life; I don't know how to live any other way than I have for the past 23 years. Changing that just to fit the social norm would be ridiculous as far as I'm concerned.

I started with a [Yamaha TW200](http://i.imgur.com/TB2p3M8.jpg) a year ago and it is the best purchase I've ever made. They're extremely reliable, very durable, heavily customizable, cheap, and grip better than any other dual sport in its price range. I purchased a 2008 model with 6000 miles on it for $2000 and it runs great. The only reason I would not recommend it is if you're over 6' because they're short and they aren't very fast. 16 hp, 65 mph top speed. Other popular starter dual sports are the Yamaha XT 250, the Kawasaki KLR 650, and the Suzuki DRZ 400. Stay away from Chinese brands. They're cheap, but unreliable and no one services them. 

Expect to spend $300-500 on proper gear and at least $300 annually on insurance. You want theft to be included. ",2016-03-10 23:51:09+00:00,d0vdomv,1.0,t3_49w4nz,1206.0,motorcycles

While there is definitely nothing wrong with that, oftentimes they end up being much more than young riders are prepared for. What I always recommend for any new rider is to look into the Dual Sport class. Dual sports are, in my opinion, the perfect bike class for beginners for a number of reasons:

- They are very cheap.

- They are extremely reliable and durable.

- They are heavily customizable.

- They can go **anywhere**.


- They look badass

And most importantly, they can handle poor road conditions like loose gravel and rough pavement much better than most bike classes can.

Number 1 being that many Harley riders firmly believe that Harleys are the only 'real' bikes and everything else is Jap crap, an attitude the company openly encourages. While Harleys aren't the worst bikes out there, they are most certainly not great. For the most part, Harleys are overpriced and favor style over substance, relying more on the name of the manufacturer to sell product than on innovation and competitive practices.

That said, Honda is a good manufacturer to go with if you plan on getting a cruiser. If you're worried about stigmas at rallies (though you shouldn't be), it would be much better to pull up on a Honda, or anything  else really, than on a Harley.

1151,"The bike looks cool but there's no telling how reliable it will be. Instead, you might look into the [Yamaha TW200](http://i.imgur.com/TB2p3M8.jpg) if you want a cheap, reliable bike you can take off-road. The TW is, in my opinion, the best bike for beginners there is. The tires are extremely wide and grip better than most other dual sports, it has very easy maintenance, its very tough, very light, and the friction zone on its clutch is a mile long. Plus, with name brand bikes you have a large community of other owners on places like the TW200 Forum who can help you with specific problems or questions you may have about them. I found a used 2008 TW200 in great condition for $2000. ",2016-02-18 21:33:38+00:00,d051e6s,1.0,t3_46gw0d,2692.0,motorcycles

1154,"The KLR 650 and the DRZ 400 both get up to around 120 kph. Those are just the two others I did real research on when I was choosing my bike. The biggest advantage the TW200 has over them is that it can traverse even rougher terrain than they can, though not a stylishly. 

Just a few weeks ago I decided to make a detour through a wildlife reserve and discovered that they just put down an excessive amount of new gravel on all the roads. Had I been riding another bike, I would have had to turn around to avoid sinking in it but thanks to the fat tires on the TW I was able to get through it with relative ease. 

Anyway, you might also look into the [Supermoto (SUMO) class](http://i.imgur.com/KIJPpxv.jpg). Supermotos are more street-oriented but they retain the functionality and style of the Dual Sport class they were born from. Early SUMO bikes were essentially dual sports with small-diameter, wide street tires fitted on them. The newer supermotos are smaller and lighter than most Dual Sports (though most aren't as small as the TW) and have more torque. The SUMO class covers a wide range of bikes, some that look exactly like dual sports (the DRZ has a dual sport and a sumo model) while others look like a hybrid between enduro and sport like the legendary [Husqvarna Nuda 900r](http://i.imgur.com/H5TbMd2.jpg). Most all of them have a very unique, and [very cool sound.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBsbAuC1esg) This class might be more suited to your style since you first mentioned the Honda CBR 250.

1157,"What I always recommend to anyone unsure about their first motorcycle is to look into buying a dual sport. Dual sports are street-legal off road bikes so you get a taste of both worlds of riding. In addition, most dual sports:

- Are very cheap

- Have easy maintenance

- Can handle being dropped

- Are heavily customizable

- Can go anywhere

- Look badass

And most importantly, they can handle unfavorable road conditions like loose gravel and rough pavement much better than most bike classes can. In short, they're the perfect bike class for beginners. Also, you live in Australia; an off-road paradise. 

The only real downsides I can think of about them is that almost, if not all, the low-end dual sports are uncomfortable to ride for more than a few hours due to the seat designs and the knobby tires, which can cause the bike to vibrate at high speeds. This is something you get used to, though. 

The [Yamaha TW200](http://i.imgur.com/TB2p3M8.jpg) is what I have and its what I started with. I do believe it is the best option for beginner riders that there is. The fat rear tire is its most defining feature and it grips the road like nothing else. I actually *can't* slide with this bike even when I try because it grips so well. The friction zone on the clutch (the half-way point on the clutch where the drive chain begins to engage with the engine) is a mile long, which is great for people learning how to ride. New, they run for around $4,500 but I found a 2008 in great condition for $2,000. The only reason I would not recommend this bike is if you're over 6', because it is very short. It will depend on your leg length, though. 

Other popular starter dual sports are the [Kawasaki KLR 650](http://i.imgur.com/4E5LSDN.jpg), the [Suzuki DRZ 400](http://i.imgur.com/aJAJ4No.jpg), and the [Yamaha XT 250](http://i.imgur.com/su9W8y2.jpg) which are taller. 

Something to keep in mind is that dual sports have 'wet clutches' while most other classes have 'dry clutches.' A wet clutch means that the clutch cable is constantly being lubricated by the engine oil while a dry clutch is, well, dry. Wet clutches last much longer than dry clutches but they contaminate the engine oil with particles from the cable. All this means is that your engine oil will be slightly more expensive for dual sports than for bikes with dry clutches because it needs to be specially formulated to last longer and retain its viscosity. The reason all bikes don't have wet clutches is because most bikes don't need them. Bikes made for rough terrain tend to have the friction zone on the clutch used more to get out of sand pits and mud. Therefore, if they didn't have a wet clutch, the clutch cable would need to be replaced much more often. Its not that important but if you're going to look into buying one its something you should know. 

I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have. ",2016-02-17 13:24:08+00:00,d0357cp,1.0,t3_467mcc,12641.0,motorcycles

From the video description:

&gt;Cruising along on a solo ride in the Renz area, I see this helmet in the trail...whaaa? I probably would have never seen the quad up there if I hadnât seen the helmet.
He said he was up there for about 5 min's before I found him there.
The trail he was on was just above, so Iâm pretty sure when he rolled off the trail, his quad rolled 270 degrees before pinning him (lucky it pinched him there instead of his chest or head, yikes!)
You can't really hear much (unless you crank the volume waaay up. Don't forget to turn it back down if you do!), so here's some of what happened: 
I warned him that I might not be able to lift it very high, and that I might have to let it back down on him, which happened, and that clearly hurt in a big way. Sorry!
I gathered these rotting logs I found for him to stuff underneath to prop it up next time I lift, but once I got it up a ways, I guess he decided he had to get the heck out of there, and got most of the way out. One more small lift after that, and he was out (and his legs were probably very numb).
I was pretty winded from lots of fast singletrack before I even got there, I gotta get in shape for these kinds of days!

Even though you said you're an advanced reader, I highly recommend picking up the 20th anniversary audio book version of the books narrated by Marc Thompson.

1246,"Oooh! Oooh! Me next!:

It was 2nd grade, 2001, during our standardized test week (why the hell they make 2nd graders take standardized tests in America, I have no idea). Before the tests started, the teacher drew names to see who got to bring their favorite snacks for everyone to share during the half-hour break between tests. Out of 20 kids, my name was drawn for Wednesday. I cannot describe to you how unreasonably excited I was for this. Everyone was going to know that I was the indisputable snack master because I was bringing, you guessed it: Mother. Fuckin'. Sour-Cream and Onion Pringles. 

When Wednesday came, I had my mom drop me off early so that I could stack my mini-pringle cups into a perfect pyramid on the counter of Mrs. Hackinburg's room. I had the smuggest look on my face all day thinking about how cool everyone was going to think I was after they saw what snacks I brought. At 10:30 AM, the bell signifying the break time rang. My heart was beating as though I had just run a marathon. This was it; my moment of glory! ""Let's see, who did I write down for snack-duty Wednesday? Oh, that's right! Darryl!""... My name is **not** Darryl. She wrote the wrong person's name down. 

You know in action films, when a character is hit with the force of a nearby explosion and all you hear is ringing while the camera shakes around violently? That's what this moment was like. In the shock of it all I didn't think to object as Darryl casually got up from his chair as though this announcement was not news to him and I watched as he walked over to my Pringle Pyramid, haphazardly grabbed an armful of pringle cups with his grubby fingers, and start passing them out. I heard the ""Thanks Darryl!""'s, the gasps of surprise and gratitude, and I just sat there, dumbfounded. Eventually, Darryl reached me and handed me a pringle cup, which I took, still not believing the injustice of what I was seeing. ""Let's all give Darryl a big round of applause everyone!"" said Mrs. Hackinburg. By the time the bell rang to go home I was shaking with rage. I packed by backpack up and walked over to the counter to grab the leftover pringles. But what I saw was Darryl stuffing them into his bag. I yelled at him to stop, saying that they were mine but he didn't stop. When I started running at him he ran off into the hallway shouting, ""Thanks for the Pringles, Daniel! Hahaha!"" I never really got back at him for this but I never forgave him and I made sure all of my friends knew what he really was. Not many people get to know what it feels like to truly hate someone that young. 

**TL;DR**: Rat piece of shit kid took credit for the Pringles I brought to share with everyone and got away with it. ",2016-02-02 01:45:50+00:00,czkge5v,1.0,t3_43qjw5,17603.0,videos

1298,"**The Witcher Series** by Andzrej Sapkowski. It fits almost, if not all of your criteria. The novels and games follow the story of Geralt of Rivia, a Witcher. Witchers are highly skilled monster slayers who have been genetically enhanced to have hightened senses, immunity to poisons, and the ability to use a form of weak magic called 'signs'. There are five signs a Witcher can use: Yrden (magic trap), Quen (shield), Igni (flame), Axii (mind influence), and Aard (force push). The novels take place in a medieval fantasy setting hundreds of years after the Witcher order was first established. Now there are fewer monsters in the world and Witchers, who were once saviors, are considered by many to be freaks. In addition to good, old-fashioned monster slaying, of which there is plenty, there is also a very intricate plot which includes power struggles between nations, prophesies of impending doom, and a girl with a unique, and dangerous power. 

You may be familiar with the Witcher 3: Wild Hunt which was released last year. Here is the [launch cinematic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehjJ614QfeM) for it which gives a perfect representation of what the novels are like.

1317,"**The Witcher Series** by Andrzej Sapkowski

As for the setting, it is medieval and it is fantasy but what sets this universe apart is the fact that magic and monsters showed up seperately1,500 years before the novels take place due to an event called ""The Conjunction of Spheres."" So imagine our medieval era, with all its corrupt rulers and discrimination but with magic and monsters thrown into the midst. 

The Witcher novels follow the story of Geralt of Rivia, a Witcher. Witchers are professional monster slayers who have been genetically enhanced to have enhanced senses, gain immunity to most poisons, and age slowly. Witchers are also able to use 5 forms of minor magic, called signs: Yrden (magic trap), Quen (shield), Igni (flame), Axii (mind influence), and Aard (force push). When they first appeared, they were revered as saviors from the monsters that plagued the land. Eventually, however, the number of monsters in the world thinned and Witchers began to be regarded as greedy low-lifes who would take any contract for a bit of coin. The Witcher universe is dark, gritty, and very rich with interesting lore. My favorite part about the novels and games, however, are the multitude of distinct and interesting monsters, each of which have their own defined strengths, weaknesses, and subtypes. 

You may be familiar with the Witcher 3 video game which came out this year. [Here is the cinematic launch trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehjJ614QfeM) for it which perfectly conveys the feel of the Witcher novels.",2016-01-21 19:05:58+00:00,cz6tg6q,1.0,t3_4203l5,17903.0,booksuggestions

Most of New Vegas is canon, but Bethesda holds the rights to retcon anything if it conflicts with something they want to do in future installments or DLC and I doubt they would hesitate if that were the case. Remember that while Bethesda published New Vegas, Obsidian held the reigns on its development. 

Bethesda doesn't like worrying about building games around lore established by other people who don't have the same vision for Fallout as they do, which is perfectly understandable. On second thought, the West coast may be the only location Bethesda would allow books to be set, assuming they don't plan on setting any future games there.

1388,"&gt;The Force is mysterious, metaphysical, magical. It doesn't need to be explained. 

Which is why I am very bitter that the 'force planet' episodes in The Clone Wars series are canon. All of the mystery and wonder surrounding the force was immediately drained by those stupid, B-grade episodes. If you haven't seen them, I envy you, but here's a summary: 

Obi Wan, Anakin, and Asoka (not important) get stranded on a strange world, which turns out to be the source of the force and they find out that The Dark and Light sides of the force are actual living beings. Their father represents the balance of the force and struggles to keep his children in check, sort of like a legend in Greek mythology. This might sound decent on paper (might) but unfortunately very poor writing and story design ensured that was not the case. I know, it was a kid's show and I shouldn't judge it too harshly but its kind of hard not to when we have this pile of shit which is canon and yet Darth Bane and Darth Plagueis never happened.

I'm very worried that the game is going to crumble under its own weight or that it will have a ton of scope and barely any depth. ",2015-12-17 01:36:41+00:00,cy1qdag,1.0,t3_3x55zt,7888.0,Games

Listen to them when you're doing yard work, going to bed, or driving. This is exactly what I did when I was starting to get into reading and it helped me tremendously.

That said, if you want something that will blow your mind and give you nightmares, I strongly suggest picking up a copy of **House of Leaves**. It is, without a doubt, the scariest book I have ever read. Don't be daunted by the size of the book, as its written in an experimental style and many of the pages contain ridiculously long footnotes which aren't actually meant to be read and plenty of pages contain only a single word. I'm not really sure how to describe the story except to say that I wouldn't recommend you read it if you are claustrophobic, as it will probably give you a panic attack if that's the case.

1427,"Maybe the **Spice and Wolf** light novel series by Isuna Hasekura? They are set in a fictionalized late medieval Germany and follow the story of a traveling merchant who reluctantly takes on a wise and impish wolf deity in the form of a young maiden as a traveling companion. On their journey to the north, Holo, with her centuries of experience, and Lawrence, with his mercantile cunning, must use their combined wits to avoid discovery by the Church and solve some interesting economic dilemmas along the way (the main character is a merchant, after all). It was a fun read and the economic concepts used in the plot were surprisingly complex, which kept me on my toes and made me really pay attention to the story. My only gripe with the books is that the dialogue, especially the dialogue between the two main characters, became very predictable in the later novels of the series but still, I enjoyed them. The romance between the main characters develops gradually and was not at all in your face like so many other romance-centered novels out there. 

The series was also adapted into a well-received anime with an exceptional [soundtrack](https://youtu.be/jbsaZMG9w30?t=13m35s) (which is perfect for listening to while reading) but it was never finished and only covered 4 of the 17 light novel volumes.

However, I highly recommend picking up the 20th anniversary edition audiobook narrated by Marc Thompson even if you do not normally listen to audiobooks. Marc Thompson's performance of each character was so convincing and compelling that I would go so far as to say it is the best narration I've ever heard.

When making tight corners I typically keep my wheel cut and feather my throttle until I'm just about to overturn and then straighten out and gun it. Its sort of hard to explain; it just takes a lot of experimentation and practice. 

Also, a good way to keep from crashing when you feel your vehicle starting to slide sideways into a tree is to downshift and give the throttle a good punch. This trick has helped me out many times.",2015-12-07 20:15:20+00:00,cxqmylq,3.0,t1_cxqlkmi,1949.0,Games

**3 tips for new players:**

- 1) Focus on finishing tracks without crashing rather than your time. Your speed will improve over time as you become familiar with the physics of the game engine and each car.

- 2) Play with most assists turned off (traction control, abs, stability control, etc). These assists will prevent you from pulling advanced moves when you do become familiar with the game. It's best to learn the game without relying on them (trust me, you'll be flying off the track all the time even with them on). Also, the game has an automatic transmission setting but for the love of God **do not use it**. I don't know how anyone could actually play the game with it. Tight cornering requires the use of high rpms to properly execute, which you can't use in automatic mode. Manual Sequential transmissions aren't difficult.

- 3) Listen to you co driver's calls or you're in for a bad time.",2015-12-07 17:43:47+00:00,cxqgkcs,1.0,t3_3vsiek,12763.0,Games

1486,"The reason its so bad is because whoever was in charge of motorcycles has no idea how they, or any kind of bike, works. If you're trying to go left and you actually point your handlebars left while going over 10 mph, guess what will happen: You will fall over because you are an idiot. 

The real way to turn a bike while at cruising speeds is to use [counter-steering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countersteering). Anyone who has ever ridden a bicycle before has used counter steering, though you may not be aware of it when you're doing it. When you have a stationary bike in front of you and you point the handlebars left, the bike leans right and vice versa. This same principle applies while its moving as well. If you're trying to go left your body automatically knows to apply gentle pressure to the left handle. 

What's crazy about the whole thing in JC3 is that the in-engine physics knows this but somehow the vehicular designer did not. This is why you fall over when you try to turn too sharply on bikes in the game. Its a shame, the bikes look so good in JC3 but they're all unusable.",2015-12-02 00:03:05+00:00,cxjrkbp,1.0,t3_3uylyq,67430.0,JustCause

1575,"&gt;It occurred to me the other night while picking a lock that the lockpicking system hasn't changed in Bethesda RPGs since I played Fallout 3. It's the exact same system in ES games as well. The hacking hasn't changed either.

Do either of those *need* to change, though? They both seem to be the best way out of all the lockpicking/hacking minigames I've ever played and they're damn satisfying every single time. The Oblivion lockpicking system was more realistic, but way too time consuming and complicated for my taste. Mass Effect 2 had a decent hacking minigame but its problem was that it *really* felt like a minigame rather than actual hacking. Bioshock's was good, though, I think but still, pretty damn complicated for a hacking minigame. Fallout's is the only hacking minigame that I can think of that actually feels like you're hacking a terminal, same goes for lockpicking.

This will mean that beds, purified water, and Stimpacks are the only real sources of health that we know of in the game. Everything else is more of a temporary solution. The new radiation penalty would work great with a Hardcore mode where you would be forced to eat irradiated food but if there's no need to eat then food is essentially useless now and not likely to be something I will even pick up after level 5 or so.

1806,"To be honest, most of the Star Wars EU is terrible and there is very little consistency. There's a reason why it was all scrapped after the Disney takeover. However, there are a few novels that many would consider even better than the films and after you read them you'll see why so many people were outraged that they are no longer considered canon.

**The Thrawn Trilogy** by Timothy Zahn is what you should start with. This one really was better than the films. The Thrawn trilogy is the -now- unofficial sequel to the original trilogy and takes place 7 years after the Battle of Endor. What was supposed to be a ""mopping up operation"" of the remaining Imperial forces quickly turns into another full-scale war for the New Republic when Grand Admiral Thrawn returns from deep space to lead the Empire. All of the new characters Zahn added to the universe have a ton of depth and are all extremely interesting while all of the returning characters are written perfectly to form. I highly recommend purchasing the 20th anniversary audiobook version narrated by Marc Thompson. His impressions of Han Solo, Luke, C3PO, Lando, and even Leia are absolutely spot on. It is the best audiobook narration I've ever heard and I have listened to **a lot** of audiobooks in my time. It can all be [listened to on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-Ws6xGdoq8).

**The Darth Bane Trilogy** by Drew Karpyshyn should be read next. It introduced the Rule of Two, a very important aspect of the Star Wars universe, and really shows the Sith in their best light. It was a grade-A story, for sure. The story takes place 1000 years before the films in the Old Republic era so don't expect to see any characters you recognize. 

Next, you should read **Darth Plagueis** by James Luceno. More politics and subterfuge than action like the above two, this book delves into the planning of the usurpation of the Republic and the purge of the Jedi Order by Darth Plageus and his apprentice... Palpatine. It also explains the origins of Darth Maul and his early apprenticeship to Palpatine. This book makes the prequel trilogy seem much, much cooler. It was extremely interesting seeing how all the plans were set in motion. A slower read, but nevertheless a high quality book.

**Other great reads:** 

- The X-Wing series.

- Tarkin  (the first canon SW novel after the Disney takeover)

- Kenobi

- I, Jedi

- The Truce at Bakura

- Outbound Flight*

- Allegiance*

- Hand of Thrawn Dualogy* (sequel to Thrawn Trilogy)

- Survivor's Quest*

- Deceived

- Crucible**

*Part of a story arc. Should be read in a certain order.

**Requires foreknowledge of characters and universe developments in the set time period.

As far as the actual gameplay goes, I'm loving the combat especially. It is exactly what I wanted in the next Fallout game. The sound design for the weapons has been drastically improved. The laser rifle actually sounds like it has impact when you fire it and that is a huge deal for me.

1886,"Story time!: Last year I was asleep in my bed when suddenly I was woken up by the sound of water splashing in my bathroom. My bathroom is inside my room in our apartment and I don't have a bunk mate. When I woke up it was pitch black but something was definitely going on in there. In my half-asleep mind I thought a water pipe had busted so I rushed into the bathroom, turned the lights on, and was greeted by the sight of a complete stranger with his pants down, taking a giant piss all over everything in my bathroom besides my toilet. And this wasn't one of those quick, 15 second pisses. This was a ""I've been drinking non-stop for 5 hours"" firehose piss that lasted for at least 2 minutes. 

The guy looked like he was 99% asleep and barely reacted to my loud profanity over the events that were unfolding in front of me. He started turning towards me while he was still urinating so I jumped out of the room and shut the door until the sound stopped. When I opened the door to see the aftermath I was completely speechless. Everything -**EVERYTHING**- in my bathroom was completely covered in urine. The shower curtain, the sink, everything on top of the sink, the floor, the bath mats, even the mirror. After a few seconds the stranger simply waved at me and mimicked my movements when I silently gestured for him to get out. Eventually, he proceeded to walk into my living room and fall asleep on the couch. I figured I'd just let him sleep it off and deal with him in the morning. I had to clean up the mess the guy made before it dried. Boy, was *that* fun. 

Turns out the guy was my roommate's brother whom he let stay the night after a party they went to. He used to know the guy who occupied my room before me so that explains why he knew where the bathroom was.

I started playing this game around 8:00 pm last night after watching some of [Dunkey's video about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtplRk6BdyA) (Warning: Spoilers in video). I got about a fourth of the way through and stopped it because, even though I very rarely enjoy classic-style RPGs, I wanted to play it for myself. I couldn't stop. I ended up playing until 4 in the morning and I'm about to start playing again. This game is something else. Tragedy, comedy, satire, all of it so incredibly well balanced in the hands of the mastermind and sole creator of the game, Toby Fox. Every character you meet feels alive and has an interesting story to tell. I legitimately felt connected to each and every one of them, even -no- *especially* to the enemies. 

For most enemies in the game, you have the option to fight or to act. When you choose the act option you usually have a list of actions you can take, such as *compliment*, *console*, *threaten*, *poke fun at*, *flex*, etc. These actions are different for each enemy and if you choose the right one or complete them in the correct order you can choose to spare the enemy, who is now reluctant to fight you. These enemies you spare in your random encounters with them may even help you later on in the game.

He was exceptionally good at the game, defeating bosses that destroyed me like Queelag and Havel the Rock on his first tries. Then I saw him use the Soul of Sif glitch, which allows a player to have an unlimited supply of souls by performing a series of button presses which makes it to where the Soul of Sif can be consumed but it doesn't go away. When I called him out on it he said that he knew he shouldn't use it but that now that he knew about the glitch it would feel silly not to use it. 

He really was excellent at the game; he hadn't leveled his character up to a ridiculous level with the glitch yet but he was using it more and more frequently in order to use weapons he wanted to use and such. It pained me to see such raw talent at such a difficult game being flushed down the drain by temptation. Eventually, he handed the controller to me so that I could help him navigate Blighttown. I knew what I had to do. As soon as he handed me the controller I went into his inventory and used the Soul of Sif so that he could never exploit the glitch again.

It will certainly be more like FO3 than New Vegas seeing as how NV was developed by Obsidian. It really all depends on how much you are liking FO3.

But back then the creators realized that character development and quality story telling comes first. I would say that the original Teen Titans cartoon had the perfect balance between comedy and seriousness for a kids' program. It was a great gateway into the, admittedly daunting, world of comics and its the reason I read them now as an adult. I doubt anyone who grew up watching Go will be able to say the same. Then again, back when TT aired we didn't have the barrage of Grade-A super-hero films we have now so there's that.  

You know how they decided to take the Minions from Despicable Me , some of the least funny characters ever invented encompassing one of the most unoriginal forms of comedy (slapstick), and decided to make an entire film centered around them?

I guess the point I'm trying to make is that if you want a cartoon to be enjoyed by multiple generations, you use 2d animation.

To be honest, Hard Cider and Mead are the only alcohols I can tolerate. Everything else tastes like pisswater to me. Then again, I've only been drinking for about a year so what do I know? ",2015-10-14 07:01:28+00:00,cvz66zk,1.0,t3_3onmhb,25209.0,videos

Though they're all amazing, I'd have to say that the Witcher 3 trailer is the best out of all of them because it actually shows the player what you will be doing, and how you can go about doing it. All of the tools, potions, and spells Geralt used in the trailer can be used in the game just as he used them. It also manages to show the player that Geralt is not invincible; he needs to plan his attacks carefully and prepare accordingly. Even the song playing in the background suggests to the player that perhaps Geralt is the real monster, as he certainly is to those he slays for coin.",2015-10-09 18:20:56+00:00,cvtypqx,1.0,t3_3o496l,6368.0,Games

Everything you know is a lie! Investigate 9/11!)^)

While The Force Unleashed did have plenty of actual saber locks in boss fights, one of my favorite parts about the game was the auto-saber lock that would occur when you and another melee npc attacked simultaneously. The two characters would do a quick, symetrical flourish with their blades, clash for just the right amount of time, and then jump back with a defensive-offense slash. Then the fight would resume. These moments made the fights feel more genuine while at the same time giving the player a moment to catch their breath.

I think this will be a great setting for Far Cry 4 if they can really deliver on melee combat, which would have to be a big part of a game set in an era where the most sophisticated weapon was a bow. The reason I say that is because Far Cry is not a title that has ever had actual melee combat before. Takedowns were always instant kills so they don't count.

Aside from the horrifying enemies (and when I say horrifying, [I mean horrifying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAgEQwX6q6Q)) and beautifully creepy music/environments, it was the fear that around every corner could be a new type of enemy you've never seen before and don't know how to defend against. This fear is multiplied by the amount of ~~souls~~ blood echoes you're carrying because you have something other than the time you spent getting there to lose. A good example of this would be the first snake head in the Forbidden Forest. At first it seemed like just another mob, no big deal. Then his fucking head exploded into 15 elongated snakes and he started running. I can say with a clear conscience that I turned the fuck around and skedaddled my ass back to the safety of werewolf/fire-bomb monsters.

Its a shame, she could have gotten so much more if she hadn't taken the money and filed an actual lawsuit against them. It was an open-shut case.

Also, the sergeant only received a  10 day suspension, to which he filed a complaint against with his union. Fucking bastard. I really wish I could find out what he's doing now.

It does contain some fantasy but don't let that deter you.

2228,"Most, if not all, car salesmen hate their jobs. They are constantly being pressured to sell cars at a ridiculous rate and if they don't at least get a certain amount of interviews with customers by the end of the month they're fired. All of them know that most people that come onto the lot try their hardest to avoid them. It has got to be one of the worst jobs in the world. Literally no one is on your side: your co-workers are competitors, your boss knows that there are 10 more people in line for your job, and every customer (besides Hank Hill) is on the defensive around you at all times. 

The next time you talk to a car salesman, they will probably mention something about setting up a phone interview with you about a car you were looking at. Be a bro and actually call them even if you have no intention of buying anything from them. They have to have a certain number of customer interviews per month and it really helps them out, especially considering that the only reason you went to the lot was to test drive a car you planned on getting somewhere cheaper.",2015-08-27 02:56:14+00:00,cuh24l8,1.0,t3_3igu7v,46684.0,videos

2235,"If you don't mind slight fantasy, the **Spice and Wolf** light novel series by Isuna Hasekura might be right up your alley. They are set in a fictionalized late medieval Germany and follow the story of a lonely traveling merchant who reluctantly takes on a wise and impish wolf deity in the form of a young maiden as a traveling companion. On their journey to the north, Holo, with her centuries of experience, and Lawrence, with his mercantile cunning, must use their combined wits to avoid discovery by the Church and solve some interesting economic dilemmas along the way (the main character is a merchant, after all). Its one of the best set ups for a romance I've ever seen and they were a great read. I have never been sucked into a romance of any kind before this series but it had me hooked. 

There are 17 volumes in total with an average of 250 pages each.

2237,"For me, speed isn't really a factor when I think about why I ride. Honestly, I find that riding at 35-50mph is the perfect cruising speed for me. 

I ride primarily for two reasons: 

- 1) The adventure. I ride a dual sport because I love the ability to truly go wherever I want, no matter the terrain. Just the other day I was exploring the backroads around my city and decided to take an obscure gravel road used by oil trucks. It led me to one of the most beautiful places I had ever been to in my area (they're hard to come by in north Louisiana so its always pretty special). That feeling of cruising through a beautiful area, smelling the pine and cedar from the trees over head; thats what I search for every time I ride. 

- 2) Like the article said, the sheer sensation. It truly is indescribable. No one can understand how it feels to ride until they get on a bike. ",2015-08-22 03:15:40+00:00,cubg83c,1.0,t3_3hvb0o,36736.0,motorcycles

2239,"I purchased my first bike about 5 months ago, a [Yamaha TW200](http://imgur.com/FinKskh). It is a fantastic beginner bike, no doubt about it. It's cheap, light, durable, easy to maintain, and the friction zone on the clutch is a mile long so it's hard to stall. Most importantly, it is very, very fun both on the road and on the dirt. That fat back tire grips like nothing else. It rolls over loose debris in corners like it isn't even there. A full gravel road may as well be a bumpy road with it. Its also a real attention grabber. I snagged a 2008 model for $2k. You can get them new for around $4k. Keep in mind that a full set of gear can easily cost you $1000 as well.

A few cons about the bike: 

- Top speed of 65mph, cruising speed of 55mph, so you won't be able to use highways (this is plenty of speed for a beginner but when you get more confident you would need to upgrade to another bike).

- 1.5 gallon tank at 80mpg and the reserve tank is unusually large. You have to stop and refuel more than you would with most bikes. It would be a good idea to keep fuel bottles with you.

- It gets uncomfortable to ride after a few hours, as it is a short bike and I'm 5'11"". I would not recommend it if you are taller than this.

The TW200 is one of the best choices for beginners due to its superb traction, easy maintenence, and affordability. However, if it doesn't sound like the bike for you, I still recommend you get a another dual sport if you want off road capabilities. A scrambler would be fine if you only plan on taking the occasional dirt or gravel road but don't expect them to handle well on real off road trails lIke dual sports do.",2015-08-21 03:56:34+00:00,cuab48m,1.0,t3_3hsx67,2966.0,motorcycles

2242,"Educating the end use market is looking to be the only permanent solution for the ivory/rhino horn trade. This worked in Yemen, who was a major importer of rhino horn until the mid 90s (though the fact that their economy collapsed and no one could afford them anymore helped). The problem is that it is unknown if the rhino or the elephant will last long enough for an education program to significantly effect demand. Not to mention the fact that the multi-billion dollar crime syndicates that run the ivory/horn trade will most likely squash any significant education efforts. 

For this strategy to work it would need to be implemented alongside aggressive short term strategies like poisoning horns and infusing tusks with dye to discolor them [(which, sadly, does not work)](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3h8fly/gps_trackers_in_fake_elephant_tusks_reveal_ivory/cu5fxsf).

Lab grown horns and tusks are being engineered in labs now which will be distributed into the market but lab grown horn is expensive to make so there's much doubt as to how well it will work.

There's always that, yes, but I do think there are plenty of ways to create a good Vietnam game other than the typical American badass story. Think about what the soldiers of the Vietnam War had to go through on a day-to-day basis: They got basic training and then were suddenly dumped in a hostile, alien environment where the enemy could literally be hiding anywhere. Deadfalls, crippling jaw traps, and trip mines were commonplace. Many soldiers were separated from their squads and had to survive in the jungle on their own or were captured and tortured. Others went insane and began gunning down civilians for sport. The right game developer could easily take any of these situations and run with it.

What I recommend is finding some rural roads in your area and just riding. You will be amazed at how good it feels to do this compared to riding around a city in traffic. Roads that seem boring in a car can be paradise on a bike. You will find yourself not worrying about where you're going and just... riding.

That's where I had my first real fall on my bike. You see, my father likes to keep a can of bug spray in the little compartment by the steering wheel of his Ranger. Well, I was riding behind him at a pretty high speed on one of the rockiest parts of the trail when all of a sudden I see a little can fall out of his vehicle. ""No problem"", I thought, ""I'll just use my expert swerving skills to swerve out of the way of it."" However, in my moment of confidence I forgot that cans can roll, which it did... right under my front tire. Had I stayed where I was on the trail the can would have missed me, it was when I tried to avoid it that I wrecked. Anyway, the can caused my bike to lose control. It went one way and I went the other. Wouldn't have been as big a deal had I invested in gear with better airflow because I had to forgo my jacket in the 110F heat. Thankfully I at least had the brains to wear my gloves and helmet, which took the majority of the impact on the sharp rocks. It did skin my shoulder up pretty badly but no broken bones. The only damage my badass of a bike sustained was a bent handbrake lever. I find it hilarious that my bike rolled over large, loose rocks all day without a problem but as soon as it came in contact with a little can of bug spray it couldn't handle it.

2350,"No, putting it in neutral will not keep the engine cooler. Pulling your clutch in does the same thing that putting your bike in neutral does: it disengages your engine from your drivetrain. Your bike has a wet clutch, meaning it can take a lot of abuse and will last a while because it is being constantly cooled and lubricated by your engine oil (the only real disadvantage of having a wet clutch rather than a dry clutch is that the particles that come off of your clutch from wear and tear contaminate the engine oil, meaning you have to change it more often). While it is very possible to burn out a wet clutch, it won't happen for a while with your bike because you won't need to work it very hard. If you owned a dual sport or dirt bike and needed to use the friction zone of the clutch a lot to get out of mud or a sand pit, then you would need to change it more often. So ya, the only time your clutch gets worn is when you use the friction zone a lot or slip it, which you probably won't do very often once you get more used to your bike.  

And don't be the guy that puts his bike into neutral when going down a hill to ""keep the engine cool.""

2357,"Okay

- I don't ride a sport bike so it may be different but you should rest the balls of your feet on your pegs, not your heels. You want to be able to put your whole body weight on your pegs if you need to lift your butt up when you go over a bump or an obstacle. If you're resting your heels on them they may slip off. 

- Check your tire pressure and cross-check it with the recommended pressure for your tire, of course. 

- Difficulty shifting could mean you need to adjust the free-play of your clutch (look it up). If not you can switch to synthetic oil and see if that helps. If not, take it to the shop.

- Yes, you can downshift into neutral in the same way you can upshift into it.

- Tight cornering can be executed by slowing down to just enough speed to keep yourself upright, pulling the clutch in, giving your bike a steady, moderate throttle, shifting your weight to the side you are turning on (actually picking your butt up and resting one cheek or the other on the seat), turning your handlebar and slowly releasing the clutch, using it to control your speed rather than your throttle. Motorcycles have a wet clutch, meaning that you won't burn them out by holding the clutch halfway like you would in a car. Make sure you turn your head in the direction you want to go, not directly in front of you or else you will not be able to turn sharply. That is the key. Your bike is going to go where you look. This will take a lot of practice.

- Always stop with your left foot on the ground and your right foot on your bike. Your right foot controls your rear brake, which is very important to have control over at all times. 

- It is very important to remember that your bike is going to go where ever you look. That means you can't get distracted and look at all the pretty scenery like you can in a car. Glancing is okay, just don't actually look at anything other than where you want to go or you'll get a much better view of those trees than you wanted. When cornering you need to look into the turn, not directly in front of you.

- Do not brake or downshift in a turn. Ever. Braking and downshifting requires traction which your bike is already using to corner. If you try to use more traction than you have your bike will slip out from under you. It is very important to remember to slow down and do all of your shifting before you begin your turn. If there is an obstacle in the road you need to brake for you have to get your bike upright before you do. Also, never slow down in a turn. Apply a steady acceleration of throttle when you are coming out of a turn. 

- When you're stopped on the road and you hear tires screeching behind you, jump off and roll!

I highly recommend: 

* *Jurassic Park/The Lost World* by Michael Chricton

- *The Foundation Trilogy* by Isaac Asimov

- *I, Robot* by Isaac Asimov

- *Dune* by Frank Herbert

- *Ender's Game/Speaker for the Dead/The Shadow Series* by Orson Scott Card

Any of these would easily pass your teacher's standards and if they don't, well she doesn't know what she's talking about and you should read them anyways ;)

2426,"If you enjoy Star Wars at all,the best audiobook I have ever listened to, and I have listened to **a lot** of audiobooks in my time, is Marc Thompson's narration of ***The Thrawn Trilogy*** by Timothy Zahn. He masterfully imitates all of the returning characters from the original trilogy while giving all of the new characters Zahn introduces to the universe their own unique voices. His [Han Solo voice](https://youtu.be/FQIASabWuus?t=3m58s), for example, is especially good. The audiobook is also dramatized so it feels like you're watching a movie.

The Thrawn Trilogy is the -now- unofficial sequel to the original trilogy and is highly regarded among fans. Set 7 years after the Battle of Endor, what was supposed to be a ""mopping up operation"" on the remaining Imperial forces quickly turns into another full fledged war for the New Republic when Grand Admiral Thrawn returns from deep space to lead the Empire. Thrawn is one of the best villains I have ever seen. He is cunning, logical, ruthless, and seemingly omnipotent. All of the new characters Zahn added to the universe have a lot of depth and are all extremely interesting while all of the returning characters are written perfectly to form.

2451,"As the video description says, the trailer contained about 70 cows, 25 of which (I believe) had to be put down at the scene due to severe injuries. The assessment of these injuries was conducted by an experienced large animal veterinarian (whom I know, personally, and trust with my own animals) who euthanized the cows as humanely as possible via injection.

If you look at the under-side of the trailer you can see an opening that was cut where the cows that could move were herded out into a [pin that was constructed around the trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajO74Uw43KU&amp;feature=youtu.be). There was one cut on the other side, as well. Unfortunately, not all of the cows could be extracted from the trailer this way so it needed to be flipped back over. The heat index was 108Â°F so a fire hose was  used to drench the cows in the trailer until the process was completed. 

The horses were there in case any of the cattle escaped from the trailer after it was turned back over so that they could be roped and corralled into a pin off-camera.

2455,"Without a doubt, the best audiobook I have ever listened to, and I have listened to **a lot** of audiobooks in my time, is Marc Thompson's narration of ***The Thrawn Trilogy*** by Timothy Zahn, a Star Wars series. He masterfully imitates all of the returning characters from the original trilogy while giving all of the new characters Zahn introduces to the universe their own unique voices. His [Han Solo voice](https://youtu.be/FQIASabWuus?t=3m58s), for example, is especially good. The audiobook is also dramatized so it feels like you're watching a movie.

The Thrawn Trilogy is the -now- unofficial sequel to the original trilogy and is highly regarded among fans. Set 7 years after the Battle of Endor, what was supposed to be a ""mopping up operation"" on the remaining Imperial forces quickly turns into another full fledged war for the New Republic when Grand Admiral Thrawn returns from deep space to lead the Empire. Thrawn is one of the best villains I have ever seen. He is cunning, logical, ruthless, and seemingly omnipotent. All of the new characters Zahn added to the universe have a lot of depth and are all extremely interesting while all of the returning characters are written perfectly to form.

2456,"If you would like a suggestion on a good fantasy romance, I highly recommend the ***Spice and Wolf*** light novel series by Isuna Hasekura. I am also a boring straight dude and had no interest in romance whatsoever in any media before giving this series a shot. I'm typically a pretty slow reader but it only took me a week to read 9 of the 250 page novels; I couldn't put them down!

The series is set in a fictionalized late medieval Germany and follows the story of a cunning merchant who reluctantly ends up traveling with a wise and playful wolf deity in the form of a young maiden with a wolf's tail and ears. On their journey to the north, the two must avoid discovery by the Church and solve some interesting economic dilemmas using the combined whit of a merchant with economic know-how and an immortal being with a silver tongue and centuries of experience. The use of rather complicated economic concepts in such an interesting and engaging manner really took me by surprise. I certainly learned a lot while reading them! Basically, it is a romance about a mortal and an immortal who gradually fall in love while on an exciting journey.

There are 17 volumes in total with an average of 250 pages each so there's tons of content to look forward to while at the same time not dragging on too long (or so I've heard). It was also adapted into an exceptional [anime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wINa_YZj-kg) which is very true to the novels, though it was never finished. The [soundtrack](https://youtu.be/jbsaZMG9w30?t=13m35s) is also amazing; perfect for listening to while reading.

Seriously, this trilogy is better than the films. You cannot miss this novel if you are a fan of Star Wars. 

**Other fantastic Star Wars novels include:**

* **The Darth Bane Trilogy [Drew Karpyshyn]**

-Written by the lead writer for KOTOR and the Mass Effect trilogy, this book series reshaped Sith philosophy into the most badass thing it could possibly be. This book introduces the *Rule of Two*: The principle concieved by Darth Revan and restored by Darth Bane that at any given time there may only be two Sith; no more, no less. The apprentice must learn from the master until they are able to kill them in open combat. This ensures that there is only progression in the Sith line until the day when the Sith are strong enough to restore the Sith Empire (thus explaining why the Old Republic stood relatively unchallenged until Palpatine's Jedi Purge). 

-This is an Old Republic book so don't expect to recognize any characters you know from the films. 

* **Darth Plageuis [James Luceno]**

-More politics and subterfuge than action like the above two, this book delves into the planning of the usurpation of the Republic and the purge of the Jedi Order by Darth Plageus and his apprentice... Palpatine. It also explains the origins of Darth Maul and his early apprenticeship to Palpatine. This book makes the prequel trilogy seem much, much cooler. It was extremely interesting seeing how all the plans were set in motion. A slower read, but nevertheless a high quality book.

These two, along with the Thrawn Trilogy, are considered to be the ""Big 3"" Star Wars stories.

**More Star Wars novels worth reading**

- I, Jedi

- The Truce at Bakura

- Outbound Flight*

- Allegiance*

- Hand of Thrawn Duology* (Sequel to the Thrawn Trilogy)

2502,"I highly recommend **Howl's Moving Castle** by Diana Wynne Jones. 

Synopsis: *Sophie has the great misfortune of being the eldest of three daughters, destined to fail miserably should she ever leave home to seek her fate. But when she unwittingly attracts the ire of the Witch of the Waste, Sophie finds herself under a horrid spell that transforms her into an old lady. Her only chance at breaking it lies in the ever-moving castle in the hills: the Wizard Howl's castle. To untangle the enchantment, Sophie must handle the heartless Howl, strike a bargain with a fire demon, and meet the Witch of the Waste head-on. Along the way, she discovers that there's far more to Howlâand herselfâthan first meets the eye.*

2503,"You really should. The timeline you created seems entirely plausible, much better than any theory I've come up with. If you do, you should start at the discovery of the existence of the Ark and then skip forward if you feel the need. That way you won't have to explain the Ark through background narration or dialogue. Just my 2 cents.

The discovery of the Ark could use a bit of work, imo. I find it pretty unbelievable that humans could locate the Ark before even activating Mass Relay 314. The Prothean ruins on Mars were part of an observation and biosciences station, set up to receive and process data from Earth as the Protheans studied Cro-Magnon humans. I doubt they would store something as vital as the Ark at a research station. Now, if they discovered files within the Prothean database mentioning the Ark, its purpose, and a clue as to its location, that would be believable. The actual discovery of the Ark would have to take place after the First Contact War if it is to be discovered by humans. ",2015-07-06 18:40:26+00:00,csu2rgh,3.0,t1_cstzm5h,4765.0,masseffect

It poses challenging philosophical and ethical questions in an exciting science fiction setting. The series has captured the hearts of millions and opened their minds to new ideas and visions for the future. Simply put, Star Trek is a model of what humanity has the potential to become.

Watch this [compilation of speeches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xh_t2fFF3B0&amp;index=4&amp;list=FL4ZUQUlCl-56LzafFU7q8zg) from Captain Jean-Luc Picard, the Captain of the Starship Enterprise in Star Trek: The Next Generation. It will give you a good idea of what the show is all about and might just make you want to watch it yourself, which you really should do.

But when she unwittingly attracts the ire of the Witch of the Waste, Sophie finds herself under a horrid spell that transforms her into an old lady.

2612,"Hmm, the **Ender's Shadow** novels had a lot of this but it is recommended that you read Ender's Game first (which you should do regardless). They were extremely good.

Also, even though it is not technically a novel, the **Death Note** manga/anime is the best story about outwitting an opponent I have ever read/watched in my life. It is about a genius high school student who finds a journal and discovers that anyone who's name is written in it dies. Naturally, he decides to use this power to kill anyone he deems evil and become the ruler of the new world he plans to create. However, another genius soon leads an investigation to find the person behind these mysterious killings and quickly catches up to the main character. The series is all about these two trying to stay one step ahead of the other and the first person to have his identity revealed dies. It was absolutely fantastic.",2015-06-18 23:12:32+00:00,csba5wk,1.0,t3_3abx1e,7172.0,suggestmeabook

2614,"Wow, you just described **Spice and Wolf**. It is a light novel series by Isuna Hasekura set in late medieval Germany about a cunning merchant who reluctantly ends up traveling with a wise and playful wolf deity in the form of a young maiden with a wolf's tail and ears. It is primarily a romance series but don't let that turn you off; there is a lot more to it than that. I did not enjoy romance in a medium before reading this series. 

On their journey to the north, the two must avoid discovery by the Church and solve some interesting economic dilemmas (the main character is a merchant, after all). There is a lot of outsmarting opponents and using whit and cooperation to get out of impossible situations in the novels. The use of rather complicated economic concepts in such an interesting and engaging manner really took me by surprise. I certainly learned a lot while reading them! To summarize, it is a romance about a mortal and an immortal who gradually fall in love while on an exciting journey. The romance aspect of the novels is not at all 'in your face'; it makes sure you are invested in both of the main characters *before* any romance starts and it develops very slowly. ""Charming"" is the best word to describe the novels. And yes, the story is told through the male character's perspective in the 3rd person


There are 17 volumes in total with an average of 250 pages each so there's tons of content to look forward to while at the same time not dragging on too long (or so I've heard). It was also adapted into an exceptional [anime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wINa_YZj-kg) which is very true to the novels, though it was never finished. The [soundtrack](https://youtu.be/jbsaZMG9w30?t=13m35s) is also amazing; perfect for listening to while reading.

2634,"- **Star Wars: The Thrawn Trilogy** by Timothy Zahn (Heir to the Empire, Dark Force Rising, The Last Command)
 
Had I known that there were Star Wars novels back in middle school I would have started reading independently a lot sooner than I did. I remember constantly checking out the *Star Wars Visual Encyclopedia* we had in our library, which contained detailed cross-sections of lightsaber, ships, and more. It simply never occured to me that there were full-fledged Star Wars novels. This trilogy is the perfect example of a great space opera/epic that captures your imagination and gets those creative juices flowing while remaining age appropriate. It is one of my favorite series. Other fantastic Star Wars novels include *The Darth Bane Trilogy*, *Darth Plagueis*, *I, Jedi*, and *Kenobi*. They may not teach important life lessons but they certainly tell fantastic, well written adventures. I often use the Thrawn Trilogy novels as a reference for model story telling when writing my own.

- **Jurassic Park/The Lost World** by Michael Crichton. 

Jurassic Park has remained my favorite film since I was a child and the books are equally impressive, if not more so. These books provide important life lessons and unique perspectives on the importance of respect for nature and evolution. Also, Dinosaurs! What with the popularity of Jurassic World at the moment I'd imagine these books would be quite popular in your library. 

- **Ender's Game** by Orson Scott Card

This is a must read. While certainly not what I would classify as a 'Young Adult' novel, it does appeal to younger people as well as old. It contains challenging ethical questions as well as a fantastic story. The sequels to Ender's Game, *Speaker for the Dead*, *Xenocide*, and *Children of the Mind* are even better but are a bit slower so they probably won't appeal to middle school students. The spinoff *Ender's Shadow* series would, though.
