Age: 6

Sex/Neuter status: Male/Neutered

Breed: German Shorthaired Pointer

Body weight: 60 lbs

History: Compound fracture on right radius.

Clinical signs: Swollen, puss-filled eyes. Doesn't seem to be in real pain aside from obvious irritation.  

Duration: Half hour?

Your general location: North-Western Louisiana, US. 

I'm not there, my parents told me about it and sent me pictures. We live on rural, fenced in land so we let our dogs roam free most of the time and let them in to sleep at night. We really can't think of what could have caused this. My first reaction was a skunk sprayed him but they said he doesn't smell. Both eyes are equally effected so it couldn't be a snake bite. There are no other animals that spray irritants/poison in Louisiana unless someone's pet cobra got loose. The only thing I can think of is that it could be an allergic reaction to something he ate or came in contact with while outside. He isn't taking any medication and hasn't been introduced to any new soaps or flea sprays recently. 

They gave him eye drops and Benadryl for the night and said they will take him to the vet in the morning if it hasn't gotten better. If anyone knows what could have caused this please let me know!

The last we heard from Focus Interactive about the game was back on October 3rd when the [Arsenal trailer](https://youtu.be/9YmaDbqfO7E) was released.

I realize that this means nothing to many of you but to a fan of the Star Wars EU, this is a dream come true! Thrawn is one of the most iconic characters in the Star Wars universe. The *Heir to the Empire* trilogy sparked new life into the Star Wars universe during the early 90s when the franchise was stagnant. It was seen as the definitive sequel to the original Star Wars trilogy until the Disney takeover and it established much of the Star Wars lore as we know it today. 

Thrawn, himself, is possibly one of the best written villains in modern science-fiction literature. His expulsion from the Star Wars canon caused a great deal of outcry from the SW fanbase. Needless to say, his return is a welcome surprise. ",books,"Grand Admiral Thrawn, the main villain in the popular ""Star Wars: Heir to the Empire"" novel trilogy, is being canonized!

- Overheating it via the quarantine lab.

- Overheating it remotely (with the remote dongle).

- Shooting/exploding it from the quarantine lab.

- Shooting it with a rifle or silverballer from outside the lab.

- Dropping a stalactite on it.

- Having a hazmat guy pick up the remote detonated rubber ducky and using them as a suicide bomber. 

A lot of those are just variations of each other and the last one isn't even an official method. There are really only 3 different ways of disposing of it: Shooting it, overheating it, or crushing it. 

This lack of variety really hampers my overall enjoyment of the level because even though I almost always think of a new way of assassinating Silvio and De Santis, there are only a few methods I can use on the virus. 

This is likely due to a lack of time and resources to fully flesh out the virus aspect of the level, which is understandable, and not from a lack of ideas. I can think of many more ways to eliminate the virus so I'm sure the devs have a long list of things they wanted to do with it but couldn't. 

Some of the methods I would have liked to see are:

- Exposing the virus to the scientists and guards outside of the quarantine lab.

- Taking the virus with you (not sure about this one but it would be cool).

- Making Silvio have a breakdown and having him destroy the virus out of a fit of madness/change of heart. 

- Giving the player an option to destroy the virus *without* entering the lab.

As many of you know, the [650 Terra](http://i.imgur.com/r2TMmIt.jpg) received great feedback from customers but its production ceased after only a year due to internal complications within the company at the end of 2013. Naturally, this means that replacement parts for the bike are scarce. If a fairing breaks, I'll be waiting on a replacement for a while and eventually, there probably won't be any replacements at all (though I believe they have said that they would be continuing to support it after its cancellation was announced 3 years ago). Thankfully, the engine is BMW so finding parts for that shouldn't be a problem and there are a surprising number of accessories available for it. Really, I'm just worried about being able to sell it when support for the bike runs out in the following years. 

The Terra fits all of my criteria from its looks to its touring abilities but I don't want to regret my decision later because of all this. Are there any owners here that could give me some advice?

I have 6 tables given to me that I need to code and insert data for:

2. [Department](http://i.imgur.com/wc8g0pY.png)

6. [Dependent](http://i.imgur.com/Mlf1gid.png)

So how do I know which ones to code first? I realize that Dept. Location should come after Department and Project Assignment should come after Project but what about the others? Does the order matter for them? My first guess would be to order them this way: 

1. Employee

2. Dependent

3. Department

4. Dept. Location

5. Project 

6. Project Assignment

However, while the game might not have the characters or story we wanted, remember that Bethesda games are what we make of them. No reviewer can cover the personal experiences you have within the game. How you and your Brotherhood companion dropped in with your power armor and miniguns on a group of unsuspecting raiders or how you narrowly survived an ambush in a vault when a room filled with sentry bots opened up.

We know next to nothing about this game other than a broad overview of what to expect. As a Fallout veteran, I was sold on FO4 before it was even announced, but if I were a newcomer I would never preorder this game. I guess that doesn't matter in this case, though, because Bethesda has already made their money back with preorders from fans (can't confirm, but I'm fairly certain I've read that somewhere on here). My guess is that they were planning to reveal more concrete information about the game along with the hype-building videos but after they made all of their money back from just pre-orders and Fallout Shelter they decided not to in order to maximize their fans' enjoyment of the game. They are probably confident that the game will get very high reviews and that this along with gameplay uploaded by players will hook the wallets of reluctant non-Fallout fans. 

For all I know, Bethesda has a plethora of gameplay footage and information about the game that they plan to release this week. It just seems to me like the time for that has past and that they really are going to keep the game shrouded in mystery until its release. For our sakes, I hope they do.

Big dogs, on the other hand, will easily knock a rider off his bike. 

The first time it happened I watched a lab wait patiently for me to get close and then bolt straight for me right in front of a car in the opposite lane. Not only did the car nearly swerve into me trying to avoid it, the dog ran right in front of me causing me to have to swerve in between it and the car. I don't know how I made it out of that one. I immediately turned around, rode up to the owner's house, knocked on their door until they opened, and briefly explained to them what happened. Then I told them to keep their stupid ass dog in their back yard (like that ever happened) and rode off. I was angry. I mean, if you don't trust your dog 100% not to run out into a busy street you keep them locked up. Its as simple as that. 

FYI, if a dog chases you on your bike you're supposed to briefly decrease your speed and then accelerate to throw off their rhythm, not kick or honk at them. This has never worked for me, but according to MSF it does  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯",motorcycles,Fairly new rider.

Is it them wanting to leave as much of the unexplored universe alone until they decide where all they want to explore with the sequels?

The Fallout universe has so much rich lore for authors to build off of.
