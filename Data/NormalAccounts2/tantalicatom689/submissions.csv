Whenever I'm playing, it turns it's self into rest mode. It'll beep once as if i pressed the power button then go to sleep. After that it'll usually beep again and turn back on. Then go back sleep. It'll repeat this process a few times before eventually shutting down completely. When I turn it back on, it gives me a loading bar on a black screen saying it's checking the system then tells me not to unplug the machine while it's turned on (which of course I'm not doing). I can barely play anything before it crashes. It will also turn on and off all the time while it's plugged making me have to unplug it so it doesn't keep me up all night with the noise. I have rebuilt the data base 3 or 4 times, I've initialized it, I'm on the latest software. I've called sony and I got a box in the mail, but that'll cost me around 150USD (about 200CAN right now) which I just can't afford. Could it be a cord issue? HDD issue? Power unit? It should be noted that it seems to do it more quickly if I'm doing something (Netflix, Gaming, Talking to people in a party without running anything else() as opposed to when it's just in rest mode or on the menu idling.
